00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
What's up guys? It is Gerb. Welcome back to the channel. Join me today as we start a

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,080
six-part series into the Alien and UFO Obscure Oddities Iceberg, posted to Reddit by user

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,360
BlikeSama. Now, for those of you who don't know what an iceberg is, an iceberg is a way

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,560
of categorizing the most known to least known components of an overall topic or theme. So

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,440
think of an iceberg in real life how the iceberg you see above the surface is only scratching

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,760
the surface of the entirety of the iceberg below the waters. So we have six layers to

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,760
this iceberg. As we start with the first layers, we're going to have some pretty well known

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,520
subjects, stuff you might have heard of as we get deeper into level five, six, we're

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,000
going to get into more fringe theories and some stuff I might not have heard of. So it

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,160
should be a learning process for all of us. I'd like to disclaim that I did not make

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,000
this iceberg, so I do not have control over the entries within it. On this channel, I

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,440
like to keep things as factual as I know them to the UFO UAP phenomena. So if there's something

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,560
that's rather bogus or absolutely absurd, I'm going to say so. And if there's something

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,520
I strongly agree with, I'm also going to say so. So let's get this started. But before

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,000
we kick it off, please consider liking and subscribing. I really like making these videos.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,480
So the more support I get, the more of an urge I have to make some quality content and

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,200
some good documentaries. If you haven't seen it yet, check out my first video with the

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,040
documentary on the Wilson Davis Memo. It's not bad, could be better, and it will be better.

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:41,000
So stick around. Let's get started, guys. Layer one. We'll call this the Observered

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,480
Layer. Extraterrestrial life simply refers to any life that does not originate from

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,520
Earth. From a single celled organism to a highly advanced civilization that can traverse

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,480
the stars in a matter of hours or days, these all classify as extraterrestrial life. So

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,640
not the most challenging concept to understand, but this first entry just boils down to any

24
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:18,200
life, carbon, or otherwise, silicon, that does not originate from Earth.

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,560
Crop circles are a phenomena in which large-scale structures are created into a field, generally

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,840
a wheat field. These structures are often pretty interesting and beautiful due to their

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,440
symmetry or geometric designs. And because of the complexity of the designs, a lot of

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,880
people like to attribute crop circles to paranormal or extraterrestrial phenomena.

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,800
Widely considered hoaxes, the craze of crop circles began in 1991, where two pranksters,

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,680
Doug Bauer and Dave Chorley, took credit for making the initial wave of crop circles with

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,640
planks of wood, rope, and baseball caps. Many of the seemingly bizarre creation tactics

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,800
of crop circles can be explained away by skeptics, including tie an end of a rope to an anchor

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,240
point on the other end to a board, which is used to crush or flatten plants. There's

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,400
also a method to bend crops after a recent rain that was discovered in Hungary in 1992.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,200
The point is, while crop circles are beautiful and interesting and have wonderful designs,

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I think it's likely, extremely likely, these are human-made and, in my opinion, not very

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,560
interesting, so I'm not going to spend more time on it.

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,360
The McMinnville UFO Photographs are some of the most famous photographs of a UFO ever

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,240
taken. On May 11, 1950, farmers Paul and Evelyn Trent saw something inexplicable near their

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,600
farmhouse in McMinnville, Oregon. When walking back to her farmhouse, Evelyn noticed a slow-moving

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,280
metallic disc-shaped object heading in her direction from the northeast. After gilling

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,920
for her husband, Paul came outside, also seeing the object. He grabbed his camera and was

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,800
able to take two photographs of the metallic disc near his home.

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,200
Due to the popularity of these photographs, the negatives were loaned to William H. Hartman,

45
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,280
an astronomer on the Condon Committee in 1967. The objective of the Condon Committee outside

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,000
of the University of Colorado Boulder was to investigate UFOs and was a government-funded

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
UFO research project. I'd like to do another video on the Condon Committee because the

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,600
program was basically told to explain UFOs away as swamp gas and weather balloons, but

49
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Hartman found some extremely interesting oddities with these photographs. Hartman was impressed

50
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,880
with the images, noting that the brightness of the underside of the craft appeared to be

51
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,920
lighter than the underside of the oil tank also seen in the images. He said this was

52
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,160
possibly due to atmospheric extinction, the same effect that makes distant mountains

53
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,920
appear washed out and blue in images. This effect suggested that the object was further

54
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,240
from the camera than the tank, not a small, local object hanging from a string like some

55
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,640
debunkers like to claim. He wrote to the Condon Committee that, quote, this is one of the

56
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,320
few UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological, and physical appear

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,520
to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic,

58
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,040
disc-shaped, tens of meters in diameter and evidently artificial flew within sight of

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:49,080
two witnesses. Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this

60
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:58,080
common bound. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:07,080
were facing an alien threat from outside this world. Alien invasion simply refers to a

62
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:15,520
worldwide invasion by an extraterrestrial species. Now, I like to think that an invasion

63
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,960
by an extraterrestrial species is pretty unlikely. It's impossible, of course, to attribute

64
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,520
human motives to a non-human intelligence, but if extraterrestrials have the ability

65
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:36,800
to traverse the cosmos and warp spacetime, it seems rather idiotic that such an advanced

66
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:45,080
species would be warmongering like we are. In my opinion, humans would be more interesting

67
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,640
to study from a distance. A hairless primate that has recently discovered how to harness

68
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,880
nuclear technology and is at the foot of exploring our solar system or destroying ourselves.

69
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,840
It's a pretty interesting place in which our species is residing. Perhaps this is something

70
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,520
like the great filter that the Fermi Paradox talks about, but alien invasion, scary, but

71
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:19,040
likely, in my opinion, no. Panspermia is a theory that life exists throughout the entirety

72
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,800
of the universe in microbial or cellular form and is distributed by space dust, meteors,

73
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,320
asteroid comets, and planetoids. Let's tackle this with an example. One possible origin

74
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:41,240
of life here on Earth is a result of panspermia. Millions and millions of years ago, Mars had

75
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,280
life, whether this was single cellular or multicellular, we don't know. But if panspermia

76
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
occurred, that means an asteroid or a meteor or something large impacted Mars' surface.

77
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,160
This kicked up much Martian soil and dust containing microbes. That dust and particles

78
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,760
then made their way over to Earth, where the seeds of life were carried from one planet

79
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:11,200
to another. There are three types of panspermia, lithopanspermia, which means life being carried

80
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,080
from one solar system to another, ballistic panspermia, which is life carried from one

81
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,840
planet to another within the same solar system, and directed panspermia. This would be human

82
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,600
sending life to other planets, essentially. The Men in Black are a shadowy organization

83
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:39,280
featured prominently in Ufology and UFO folklore. Essentially, the Men in Black are suit clad

84
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,520
government agents who are used to question, interrogate, threaten, harass, and sometimes

85
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,240
assassinate, experiencers of UFOs and extraterrestrials.

86
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,800
The legend of the Men in Black can be traced back to June 27, 1947. Harold Dahl was on

87
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,400
a conservation mission on the Puget Sound near the eastern shore of Washington's Mowry

88
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,760
Island. I believe he was gathering logs or just doing some outdoor work when he saw six

89
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,000
donut-shaped obstacles hovering about half a mile above his boat. Some debris fell from

90
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,040
the obstacles, a piece of which struck and killed his dog. Dahl was able to take pictures

91
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,280
of the craft and record some footage. The following day, Dahl was visited by a man in

92
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,760
a black suit. The two had to a local diner where the man was able to recount in extreme

93
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,640
detail what Dahl had witnessed the night before. The man said, quote, what I have said to

94
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,320
you is proof to you that I know a great deal more about this experience of yours than you

95
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,680
will want to believe. Dahl was then told not to speak of the incident. If he did, bad things

96
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,400
would happen. As a final statement on the Men in Black, I'd like to say that these

97
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,400
guys don't always need to be in suits, okay? What you could consider the Men in Black,

98
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,160
people opposing any sort of discussion or sharing of information or footage of UFOs could

99
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,160
also just be described as men in military fatigues. This is what happened during the

100
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,960
Roswell incident with Jesse Marcell and the girl whose fireman father witnessed the crash

101
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,680
craft as well as Lieutenant Robert Jacobs in his footage of a UFO disabling a nuclear

102
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,960
warhead. So the men can be in suits. That dives a little bit more into the paranormal

103
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,640
and weird things or just men in military fatigues blocking any sort of conversation or spreading

104
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,840
of information. I would like to mention I think these suit clad men in black are a total

105
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:53,400
hoax and distract from the actual validity of people within the United States government

106
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,280
and high ranking officials trying to stop the spread of legitimate UFO sightings and

107
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:08,040
footage. So I am not a fan of the suit clad men in black. I think it's a little bit ridiculous.

108
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,480
The Nazca lines. If you have seen ancient aliens on the history channel, I'm willing

109
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,800
to bet you have heard of the Nazca lines. If not, no worries. I got you. The Nazca lines

110
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,520
are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca desert near southern Peru. It's

111
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,960
estimated that most of these pictures depicting animals were created between 500 BC and 500

112
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:40,440
AD. These large geoglyphs were made by making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert

113
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,600
floor, removing stones and pebbles, and leaving different colored dirt to be exposed. Now

114
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,960
seen from the ground, the Nazca lines appear as nothing more than lines. But when viewed

115
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,520
from an aerial position, the Nazca lines then start to depict the beautiful creatures

116
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,920
that they're made to represent. While it's highly likely that the Nazca lines were used

117
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,440
for ancient religious purposes, such as offerings to gods who would be able to see the lines

118
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,480
from the heavens or other varying rituals, author Eric Von Daniken in his book Chariots

119
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,400
1968 proposed that the Nazca lines were in fact used as landing sites for UFOs. He theorized

120
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,200
that the shapes and lines were made by extraterrestrials and were created to help steer their spaceships

121
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,480
to land safely. Von Daniken claimed the patterns at the site looked very similar to modern

122
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,040
airport designs and used this as pieces of evidence to prove that extraterrestrials

123
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,760
used this Nazca plane as a landing space for their spacecraft. I of course favor the prosaic

124
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,200
explanation here. I think the Nazca lines were likely used for religious purposes and are also

125
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,800
observable from nearby hills and mountains, not just from the air, from airplanes or spacecraft.

126
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,560
But it is fun to think about the ancient astronaut theory, I mean that's why ancient aliens has

127
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,840
like 30 seasons. The Betty and Barney Hill Incident is one of the most famous alien abduction

128
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:26,000
stories in US history. Their story begins at around 1030 on September 19th 1961. The couple

129
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,840
was driving back from a vacation near Niagara Falls in Montreal just south of Lancaster, New

130
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,360
Hampshire. Upon driving, Betty observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved just below

131
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,840
the moon and the planet Jupiter. Betty noticed the light moved erratically and grew bigger and

132
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,000
brighter at various times, and Betty urged Barney to stop the car so the two could take a closer

133
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,400
look. Through binoculars, Betty noticed an odd shaped craft travel across the face of the moon

134
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,800
with flashing multicolored lights. Initially, Barney thought this may have been a commercial

135
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,600
airliner, but as the craft turned towards him and started rapidly descending, he quickly changed his

136
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,440
mind. The couple then continued driving, observing the well illuminated craft moving erratically

137
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,360
back and forth in the night sky. The object rapidly descended toward the hill's vehicle,

138
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,400
causing Barney to stop the car in the middle of the highway. The silent craft hovered about

139
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,240
80 to 100 feet above them, reminding Barney of a large pancake. Barney then claimed to have seen

140
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,080
8 to 11 humanoid figures who were all peering out of the craft's windows looking at him.

141
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,760
All but one figure then retreated back into the craft. The one remaining figure

142
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,000
communicated with Barney telepathically, giving him a message saying,

143
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,560
quote, Stay where you are and keep looking, end quote. Now it's worth mentioning that later on

144
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,320
when Barney reported this abduction to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena,

145
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,960
NICAP, he explicitly stated, quote, Beans were somehow not human. Red lights then began to

146
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,240
telescope out of the sides of the craft and a long structure descended from the bottom of the

147
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:28,320
craft, approaching Barney. The couple then arrived home, perplexed, noticing that their memories

148
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:36,160
became incomplete and fragmented after observing the craft buzzing towards them. About 10 days

149
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,120
after the incident, Betty began having strange vivid dreams for five successive nights. Within

150
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,080
these dreams, she was escorted by small humanoids five to five feet four inches tall with Barney

151
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:57,920
walking behind her. She recalls after being walked with the humanoids being set back by her car,

152
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,400
where the leader suggests they wait for the craft's departure. The hills then sought hypnosis to

153
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,240
explain their missing time after their encounter. Seen as their 178 mile drive home from their

154
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,400
vacation should have taken about four hours, but their drive took seven, meaning there were three

155
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,880
hours of missing time where they could not explain what happened. Barney's first session of hypnosis

156
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,880
is extremely disturbing. He recalls running from the UFO back to his car. He recalls driving away

157
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,960
from the UFO, but felt an irresistible urge to pull off the road and drive into the woods.

158
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,560
Upon doing so, he cited six figures standing on the dirt road. He described these figures

159
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,800
very similar to what occurred in Betty's dreams. Barney said the beans stared into his eyes with

160
00:16:50,800 --> 00:17:00,480
a terrifying effect. Barney said, quote, Oh, those eyes, they're in my brain. And, quote, I was told

161
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,920
to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mind. And I felt like the eyes had pushed

162
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:13,120
into my eyes, end quote. And finally, quote, All I see are these eyes. I'm not even afraid that

163
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,840
they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing

164
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:25,360
against my eyes, end quote. Betty's recollections from hypnosis were remarkably similar to Barney's.

165
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,560
In her hypnosis session, she recalls being aboard the craft, talking about the technology she saw

166
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,040
and a star map she observed within what she guessed was the craft's control room. Now,

167
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,120
this star map is pretty controversial, as some interpretations show it bearing soul, our sun,

168
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,480
as well as the creatures coming from the Zeta reticuli system. And there has been a back and

169
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,880
forth into this star maps authenticity, including a rebuttal by Carl Sagan in the 1980s cosmos.

170
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,080
But even members on the Condon UFO report, as mentioned earlier, said the odds of this being

171
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,200
a random configuration of stars were quote, at least 1000 to one against, end quote. There's a

172
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,840
lot more to the Betty and Barney Hill incident, a lot more to study and a lot more to talk about.

173
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,760
I can't give it justice in this couple minute segment, but that's a brief overview.

174
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,480
Rawleism is a UFO religion dating back to the 70s in France, founded by Claude Vorihon.

175
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,200
The religion teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity

176
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,440
using their advanced technology. Now, key historical and religious figures such as Buddha, Jesus,

177
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,440
and Muhammad have been mistaken for gods throughout history, even though they were just Elohim.

178
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,240
The Elohim created 40 human Elohim hybrids who have served as prophets throughout the history

179
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,120
of humanity. The religion believes that since the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, humanity has entered

180
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,600
an age of apocalypse and will destroy itself with nuclear annihilation unless it finds a way to

181
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,960
peacefully harness these technological developments. Because of this upcoming apocalypse, the Rawleians

182
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,080
have sought to build an embassy for the Elohim that incorporates a landing pad for their spaceship.

183
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,480
This religion slash cult isn't harming anybody, so it's kind of fun to read about,

184
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,320
and it's not as dangerous as some other UFO death cult. So yeah, fun little read.

185
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,040
The Kardashev Scale is a fascinating method of measuring the civilization's level of technological

186
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,240
advancement based on the amount of energy the civilization is capable of harnessing.

187
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,520
The Kardashev Scale was first proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964.

188
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,640
There are traditionally three types of Kardashev civilizations.

189
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,960
Type one, a planetary civilization, is able to harness all available energy from their

190
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,040
planetary system. This gives the civilization control over the entire planet's natural forces,

191
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,840
including weather and other various phenomena. A type two is a stellar civilization, a civilization

192
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,840
that is able to harness all available energy from their host, star. This is done through

193
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,280
hypothetical methods such as a Dyson Sphere, which we'll touch on later. And the type two

194
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,600
civilization is able to occupy other planets and other moons within their system. Finally,

195
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,000
a type three civilization is known as a galactic civilization. A galactic civilization is able to

196
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,880
control energy on the scale of their entire host galaxy. Type three civilizations are able to travel

197
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:55,520
across, stars to stars, and colonize their entire home galaxy. Now the Kardashev Scale increases

198
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,280
to a Kardashev four and a Kardashev five, in which a civilization is able to control the total

199
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:08,480
energy output of a galactic cluster, and a type five where the civilization can control the energy

200
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,560
output of an entire universe, but we don't know if that's theoretically possible. You may ask

201
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,680
yourself where does Earth and humans fall on the Kardashev Scale? We are currently about a 0.7

202
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,480
rating on the Kardashev Scale. The Phoenix Lights refers to a mass UFO sighting in a boomerang or

203
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:39,520
V formation over Phoenix, Arizona in March 13 1997, and persists as one of the largest and most

204
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,280
perplexing mass sightings of a UFO in US history. The sightings of hundreds of people are often

205
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,120
explained away by the official narrative that these sightings was due to flares and flying

206
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,480
formations of A-10 Thunderbolt 2 aircrafts. But the governor of Arizona himself,

207
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,160
Fife Simen, observed the event and attempted to make an official inquiry, but was denied.

208
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,160
He's quoted as saying, quote, I'm a pilot, and I know just about every machine that flies.

209
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,760
It was bigger than anything I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it,

210
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,680
responsible people. In 2017, Simington also wrote an editorial piece for CNN which he further

211
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,040
discussed his experience with the Phoenix Lights. He said he observed a large delta-shaped craft

212
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,920
which moved silently in the sky. He said it was dramatically large with, quote,

213
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,240
very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights, end quote. He expressed his dissatisfaction

214
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,400
in the Air Force's official explanation of test flares and claimed he did in fact see a large craft.

215
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,720
The truth here, I'm not sure. The flare explanation can be valid for some sightings such as Jeremy

216
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,280
Corbell's Palm Spring UFO footage in 2023. But due to the witness testimony of hundreds of people,

217
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,200
including the governor of Arizona himself, I'm not sure we can rule out the possibility a strange

218
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,960
and anomalous craft flew over the city of Phoenix, Arizona.

219
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,960
The Battle of Los Angeles is a famous event that occurred in the city of Los Angeles, California,

220
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,200
on late February the 24th of 1942. Fresh off of the attack on Pearl Harbor and entry into World War

221
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,120
II, the U.S.'s war nerves were at a relative all-time high, expecting any time an attack from

222
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,280
Japan on the western coast. Over a number of hours, multiple radar signatures were detected,

223
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,600
sending the local military into a scramble. An impending threat of attack by the Japanese was

224
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,160
expected, prompting an aerial bombardment. One quote from the scene says, quote,

225
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,880
the air erupted like a volcano, end quote. Five civilians died in the aerial bombardment,

226
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,520
three from car accidents, two from heart attacks. But later on, it was determined that the reasoning

227
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,680
behind the aerial bombardment was war nerves or a meteorological balloon. A photo was then published

228
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:25,920
in the LA Times on February 26th of 1942. The photo show searched lights focused on what looks to be

229
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,840
a saucer-type spacecraft. However, it's controversial that this photo may have been altered,

230
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,600
heavily altered, and thus might not be an actual representation of what exactly the search lights

231
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,520
and artillery cannons were shooting at. But this is an interesting story. The Battle of Los Angeles

232
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,600
is actually one of the cases that got me into the study of UFOs as a young kid. Nowadays, I don't

233
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,560
think it's that interesting. I think that there's probably a likely prosaic explanation here, but

234
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,680
I have a lot of nostalgia for this case. But interesting nonetheless.

235
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,160
The reptilian theory is a conspiracy theory that was proposed by David Ike. Essentially,

236
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,840
the reptilian theory talks of a shape-shifting reptilian race of aliens that is evil and slowly

237
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,200
taking control of Earth by taking on human form and gaining political or social power to manipulate

238
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:36,480
human entities. First introduced in 1999 in Ike's book The Big Secret, reptilians are tall, blood

239
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,040
drinking, shape-shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconi star system hiding in

240
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,960
underground bases and in plain sight. These reptiles have a conspiracy against humanity,

241
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,880
whether that means to take over the world, subjugate humanity, or whatever. I'm not quite

242
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,760
sure, but numerous people including the Rothschilds, Bush, and British royal family are reptiles,

243
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:09,360
according to Ike. There are up to six. The reptilian theory has become one of the world's most popular

244
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,240
conspiracy theories, with many internet users trying to find videos of political leaders

245
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,240
that have discrepancies in their eyes or lizard eyes, as well as a lot of public places leaning

246
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,800
into the conspiracy. For example, I live in Denver, and the Denver International Airport,

247
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,200
which has been shrouded in conspiracy, has really leaned into the whole reptilian thing with a lot

248
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:39,040
of posters of reptiles and such. The Pentagon UFO videos finally were eaten. The Pentagon UFO videos

249
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,920
refer to a series of three videos taken by the DoD, Air Force, or military regarding UFOs that

250
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,920
were classified, but released due to the efforts of Llewella Zondo and Chris Mellon, and published

251
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,800
via The New York Times with Leslie Keane and Ralph Blumenthal. These three videos show anomalous

252
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,040
craft taken on FLIR footage, labeled Go Fast, Gimbal, and FLIR.

253
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,400
I'd like to focus on the Gimbal video as shown here, which was taken in 2015 off the coast of

254
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,040
Florida. A targeting pod on an F-A-18 captured this anomalous object, which the pilot said was

255
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:32,320
able to move with no visible propulsion method and stand stationary in severe winds.

256
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,400
Now, unfortunately, there's a clip in part of this video that has not been declassified,

257
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,160
and this is confirmed by the pilots who recorded this video, as well as Christopher Mellon. But

258
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,400
within the rest of the video, this craft rendezvous with a series of other crafts and takes a V

259
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,640
formation. That's extremely strange, and I would give anything to be able to see that footage, but

260
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,760
clown debunkers like Mick West like to claim that the Gimbal video is a bird, or a jet moving

261
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,560
away from the F-A-18, and thus is a lens artifact on the FLIR footage. I like to trust the eyes of

262
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,320
the trained pilots who have recorded these videos, not some dude who sits in his basement and tries

263
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,640
to debunk every single thing that ever exists on UFOs. So, very curious video. I love this. This

264
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:33,920
is a classic. All three are classics. Area 51. Now, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on Area 51,

265
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,400
because I know all of you have heard of it, and I'd like to make a video itself on Area 51, but

266
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,600
we'll give a summary. Area 51 is the common name for a highly classified U.S. Air Force base

267
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:56,320
in the Nevada desert, near Groom Lake and former nuclear test ranges. For decades, Area 51 went

268
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,280
unacknowledged and was associated with conspiracies of UFOs and experimental aircrafts. In fact,

269
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:10,640
Area 51 wasn't officially acknowledged until 2013, where the CIA publicly acknowledged the base

270
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,200
through a Freedom of Information Act request. Many believe that Area 51 isn't just home to

271
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,800
experimental aircraft tests like the U-2 tests and reverse engineering foreign adversaries like

272
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,760
the MiG jets, but is also housed for reverse engineering and test flights of UFOs. While I

273
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,280
don't really want to cover that on this video, I will leave you with this. Pictured on screen is a

274
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:43,520
project patch from Area 51, supplied by Eric Tabor. Eric Tabor is an official UFO whistleblower who

275
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,800
submitted a memorandum for record to Arrow, the all-domain anomaly resolution office, that this

276
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,480
patch belonged to his great uncle, Sam Yerkuhart. I'm not sure how to pronounce his name, it's a

277
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,200
little tough to spell. But his great uncle divulged to him that while working at Area 51 as a contractor,

278
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,920
he was privy to learn that the base housed an egg-shaped UFO that was found intact in the

279
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,840
Nevada desert. It's worth noting that Sam was the head of security for an engineering group,

280
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,440
the radar cross-section training team, so it's not wild to think he was privy to some strange

281
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,760
information. True or not, this is extremely interesting as Tabor has submitted a legal document

282
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:37,040
to Arrow testifying that this is, in fact, true. So maybe Area 51 has housed UFOs. But we'll save

283
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:45,520
that for another time. The Nordic aliens are a supposed race of extraterrestrial humanoids

284
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,720
who come from the Pallades system and resemble Nordic Scandinavians. The Nordics are often

285
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,840
taller than regular humans, six to seven feet tall, have blue eyes, fair skin, and long blonde hair.

286
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Throughout the 1950s, many people alleged to have encounters with the Nordic aliens claiming they

287
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:15,040
were benevolent and magical, often caring about humans and the world's prosperity. The Nordics

288
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:23,280
were able to communicate with humans via telepathy and possessed a cool calming demeanor that proved

289
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:31,920
to be youthful, affectionate, and kind. The Nordic aliens are part of a galactic federation

290
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,720
and traverse the cosmos from their spherical to cigar shaped crafts.

291
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,360
Interestingly enough, if you've heard of the abduction case of Travis Walton, a film was made

292
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,320
about him called Fire in the Sky, I'd recommend checking it out. But Travis Walton has a very

293
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,640
curious abduction story that has a lot of intriguing aspects to it, let's just say that.

294
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,520
And from his testimony, when he's taken aboard a UFO craft, he encounters several types of beings,

295
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,960
such as the common graze, including a Nordic like race of tall humanoids.

296
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,680
Are the Nordic aliens real? I don't know. I don't like to focus too much on abduction stories or

297
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,400
extraterrestrial races. I just like to focus on the fact there is something in our sky that's of

298
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,280
non human intelligence or multiple things in the sky of non human intelligence and start there.

299
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,760
We got a lot to work through before we start deciphering what exactly these things are if

300
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:40,240
they're even extraterrestrials. The graze are the archetypal extraterrestrial and most famous

301
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:48,160
depiction of extraterrestrials ever. Often just referred to as graze, graze are typically gray

302
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:55,120
skinned, small humanoid beings between three and five feet tall, completely hairless,

303
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,240
with enlarged heads, sometimes a small slit like mouth, sometimes no mouth, sometimes just nostrils,

304
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:11,440
sometimes no nostrils, and large black piercing eyes. The graze often lack muscular definition

305
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,240
and have a visible skeletal structure. I want to stress with their head size, their head is usually

306
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:27,200
comically larger than their body. Now the gray can possibly be traced all the way back to 1917,

307
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,680
where occultist Aleister Crowley performed a black magic ritual and was able to contact a

308
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:42,080
bean named Lamb across space and dimensions. But I like to look at the fact the graze really became

309
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,600
popular in the 1947 Roswell crash. These were the supposed beans that were found dead or dying by

310
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,720
their crashed craft a little bit northwest of Roswell, New Mexico. I'd like to make a long

311
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,720
video on Roswell because it's fascinating, but also remember Betty and Barney Hill. These small

312
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,720
humanoid beings match the depiction of graze as well. In fact, graze are so commonly involved with

313
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,720
alien abductions. Graze make up about 50% of claimed abductions or sightings in Australia,

314
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:20,000
73% in the US, 48% in continental Europe, and 12% around the UK.

315
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,640
There are many interesting theories about what exactly the gray is, some of them being the

316
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:32,640
graze are basically biological drones utilized by other extraterrestrial civilizations.

317
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,960
Graze are often described as emotionless, kind of hive-minded and worker bees, so this could imply

318
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,840
that they're just biological drones. Graze sometimes are often associated with future humans

319
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,080
as well, claiming that as humans evolve we rely less on our muscles, spend more time indoors,

320
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,520
receive more receding hair across our bodies, get enlarged eyes from looking at screens.

321
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,440
And that's interesting to think about too. I'm not sure about that I like it, but

322
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,840
also that graze are just humanoid figures that evolved on a planet with somewhat similar conditions

323
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:15,040
to Earth. Regardless of where they originate, the graze are fascinating and I somewhat believe

324
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,560
some sort of non-human intelligence on this planet resembles the classic gray.

325
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,160
Little green men, I'm not going to spend time on this one, especially since little green men are

326
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,760
essentially green graze, and the term little green men is often used by politicians to kind of shrug

327
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,960
off and make fun of any UAP or UFO sightings. You'll often time see Pentagon conversations or

328
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,520
official military talks when talking about UFOs, say we found no evidence of little green men,

329
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,040
so I just have no interest entertaining this entry. I understand I'm getting a little bit

330
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:04,000
pressed about this, but yeah, I stop here. Hoya Bashu is essentially the most haunted

331
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,280
forest in the world. It's nestled in Romania and has many unexplicable and strange phenomena such

332
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:19,440
as UFO sightings. I've never heard of this forest. I really don't have much to say about this entry

333
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,360
besides apparently in the 1960s there have been UFO sightings in the forest and images taken.

334
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:36,080
And lastly we have the 1952 Washington DC UFO incident. This mass sighting of UFOs occurred

335
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:44,800
over the weeks of July 19th through the 20th and July 26th through the 27th of 1952. At 11.40 pm

336
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,760
on Saturday July 19th 52 Edward Nugent an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport

337
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,000
spotted seven objects on his radar. He knew immediately that this was a very strange situation

338
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,640
as the crafts moved erratically compared to any normal aircraft. Nearby two controllers at the

339
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,880
national airport's radar equipped control tower looked outside and saw a hovering bright light in

340
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,760
the sky which departed at incredible speeds. At this point other objects appeared in all

341
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,040
sections of the radar scopes and they moved over the White House the U.S.'s capital. Jets were

342
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:32,640
scrambled from nearby Newcastle Air Force Base in Delaware to investigate the six fast moving

343
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,400
bright lights over the nation's capital. The jets found no such objects they eventually ran

344
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,240
out of fuel and had to return to their bases. Later on on July 26th 1952 the event occurred

345
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,920
again where a pilot and stewardess on a national airline's flight into Washington DC

346
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,600
observed erratic moving lights above their aircraft. Within minutes both radar centers at

347
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,960
national airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked the objects. The occurrence made front page

348
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,760
headlines and caused a great deal of concern for President Harry Truman who made personal calls

349
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,680
to his Air Force aides to find out what the heck happened as well as garnered much CIA interest.

350
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,440
In response to this event the Robertson panel was formed to quote strip the unidentified flying

351
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,920
objects of their special status they have been given in the aura of mystery they have

352
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,840
unfortunately acquired end quote. So the 1952 UFOs over DC directly leads to the decades long

353
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,320
stigma around UFOs and this is very interesting and I'll make another video about this.

354
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,760
Well my friends that is layer one to the alien and UFO obscure oddities iceberg. I hope everybody

355
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,480
enjoyed this first layer a ton of interesting entries looking down the list we're going to have

356
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,120
a lot more extremely interesting things to cover and I cannot wait. Remember if you liked the video

357
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:09,040
consider tossing out a subscription and a like doesn't cost you nothing and it allows me to

358
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,440
make more interesting videos like this so stay tuned friends I'm going to start part two immediately.
