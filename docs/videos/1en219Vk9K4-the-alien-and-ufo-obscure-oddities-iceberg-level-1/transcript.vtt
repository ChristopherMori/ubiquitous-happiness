00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
What's up guys? It is Gerb. Welcome back to the channel. Join me today as we start a

00:06.360 --> 00:13.080
six-part series into the Alien and UFO Obscure Oddities Iceberg, posted to Reddit by user

00:13.080 --> 00:18.360
BlikeSama. Now, for those of you who don't know what an iceberg is, an iceberg is a way

00:18.360 --> 00:23.560
of categorizing the most known to least known components of an overall topic or theme. So

00:23.560 --> 00:29.440
think of an iceberg in real life how the iceberg you see above the surface is only scratching

00:29.520 --> 00:34.760
the surface of the entirety of the iceberg below the waters. So we have six layers to

00:34.760 --> 00:39.760
this iceberg. As we start with the first layers, we're going to have some pretty well known

00:39.760 --> 00:44.520
subjects, stuff you might have heard of as we get deeper into level five, six, we're

00:44.520 --> 00:49.000
going to get into more fringe theories and some stuff I might not have heard of. So it

00:49.000 --> 00:54.160
should be a learning process for all of us. I'd like to disclaim that I did not make

00:54.160 --> 00:59.000
this iceberg, so I do not have control over the entries within it. On this channel, I

00:59.040 --> 01:04.440
like to keep things as factual as I know them to the UFO UAP phenomena. So if there's something

01:04.440 --> 01:08.560
that's rather bogus or absolutely absurd, I'm going to say so. And if there's something

01:08.560 --> 01:14.520
I strongly agree with, I'm also going to say so. So let's get this started. But before

01:14.520 --> 01:20.000
we kick it off, please consider liking and subscribing. I really like making these videos.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.480
So the more support I get, the more of an urge I have to make some quality content and

01:24.480 --> 01:28.200
some good documentaries. If you haven't seen it yet, check out my first video with the

01:28.200 --> 01:33.040
documentary on the Wilson Davis Memo. It's not bad, could be better, and it will be better.

01:33.040 --> 01:41.000
So stick around. Let's get started, guys. Layer one. We'll call this the Observered

01:41.000 --> 01:50.480
Layer. Extraterrestrial life simply refers to any life that does not originate from

01:50.480 --> 01:57.520
Earth. From a single celled organism to a highly advanced civilization that can traverse

01:57.600 --> 02:03.480
the stars in a matter of hours or days, these all classify as extraterrestrial life. So

02:03.480 --> 02:09.640
not the most challenging concept to understand, but this first entry just boils down to any

02:09.640 --> 02:18.200
life, carbon, or otherwise, silicon, that does not originate from Earth.

02:18.200 --> 02:24.560
Crop circles are a phenomena in which large-scale structures are created into a field, generally

02:24.600 --> 02:29.840
a wheat field. These structures are often pretty interesting and beautiful due to their

02:29.840 --> 02:35.440
symmetry or geometric designs. And because of the complexity of the designs, a lot of

02:35.440 --> 02:41.880
people like to attribute crop circles to paranormal or extraterrestrial phenomena.

02:41.880 --> 02:47.800
Widely considered hoaxes, the craze of crop circles began in 1991, where two pranksters,

02:47.800 --> 02:53.680
Doug Bauer and Dave Chorley, took credit for making the initial wave of crop circles with

02:53.680 --> 03:00.640
planks of wood, rope, and baseball caps. Many of the seemingly bizarre creation tactics

03:00.640 --> 03:06.800
of crop circles can be explained away by skeptics, including tie an end of a rope to an anchor

03:06.800 --> 03:12.240
point on the other end to a board, which is used to crush or flatten plants. There's

03:12.240 --> 03:19.400
also a method to bend crops after a recent rain that was discovered in Hungary in 1992.

03:19.400 --> 03:25.200
The point is, while crop circles are beautiful and interesting and have wonderful designs,

03:25.200 --> 03:30.200
I think it's likely, extremely likely, these are human-made and, in my opinion, not very

03:30.200 --> 03:35.560
interesting, so I'm not going to spend more time on it.

03:35.560 --> 03:41.360
The McMinnville UFO Photographs are some of the most famous photographs of a UFO ever

03:41.360 --> 03:49.240
taken. On May 11, 1950, farmers Paul and Evelyn Trent saw something inexplicable near their

03:49.280 --> 03:56.600
farmhouse in McMinnville, Oregon. When walking back to her farmhouse, Evelyn noticed a slow-moving

03:56.600 --> 04:02.280
metallic disc-shaped object heading in her direction from the northeast. After gilling

04:02.280 --> 04:07.920
for her husband, Paul came outside, also seeing the object. He grabbed his camera and was

04:07.920 --> 04:13.800
able to take two photographs of the metallic disc near his home.

04:13.800 --> 04:19.200
Due to the popularity of these photographs, the negatives were loaned to William H. Hartman,

04:19.200 --> 04:25.280
an astronomer on the Condon Committee in 1967. The objective of the Condon Committee outside

04:25.280 --> 04:32.000
of the University of Colorado Boulder was to investigate UFOs and was a government-funded

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
UFO research project. I'd like to do another video on the Condon Committee because the

04:37.000 --> 04:42.600
program was basically told to explain UFOs away as swamp gas and weather balloons, but

04:42.600 --> 04:48.720
Hartman found some extremely interesting oddities with these photographs. Hartman was impressed

04:48.760 --> 04:52.880
with the images, noting that the brightness of the underside of the craft appeared to be

04:52.880 --> 04:57.920
lighter than the underside of the oil tank also seen in the images. He said this was

04:57.920 --> 05:03.160
possibly due to atmospheric extinction, the same effect that makes distant mountains

05:03.160 --> 05:09.920
appear washed out and blue in images. This effect suggested that the object was further

05:09.920 --> 05:15.240
from the camera than the tank, not a small, local object hanging from a string like some

05:15.280 --> 05:21.640
debunkers like to claim. He wrote to the Condon Committee that, quote, this is one of the

05:21.640 --> 05:28.320
few UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological, and physical appear

05:28.320 --> 05:34.520
to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic,

05:34.520 --> 05:41.040
disc-shaped, tens of meters in diameter and evidently artificial flew within sight of

05:41.080 --> 05:49.080
two witnesses. Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this

05:49.080 --> 05:58.080
common bound. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we

05:58.080 --> 06:07.080
were facing an alien threat from outside this world. Alien invasion simply refers to a

06:07.080 --> 06:15.520
worldwide invasion by an extraterrestrial species. Now, I like to think that an invasion

06:15.520 --> 06:20.960
by an extraterrestrial species is pretty unlikely. It's impossible, of course, to attribute

06:20.960 --> 06:27.520
human motives to a non-human intelligence, but if extraterrestrials have the ability

06:27.520 --> 06:36.800
to traverse the cosmos and warp spacetime, it seems rather idiotic that such an advanced

06:36.880 --> 06:45.080
species would be warmongering like we are. In my opinion, humans would be more interesting

06:45.080 --> 06:51.640
to study from a distance. A hairless primate that has recently discovered how to harness

06:51.640 --> 06:58.880
nuclear technology and is at the foot of exploring our solar system or destroying ourselves.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.840
It's a pretty interesting place in which our species is residing. Perhaps this is something

07:04.920 --> 07:10.520
like the great filter that the Fermi Paradox talks about, but alien invasion, scary, but

07:10.520 --> 07:19.040
likely, in my opinion, no. Panspermia is a theory that life exists throughout the entirety

07:19.040 --> 07:25.800
of the universe in microbial or cellular form and is distributed by space dust, meteors,

07:25.800 --> 07:33.320
asteroid comets, and planetoids. Let's tackle this with an example. One possible origin

07:33.320 --> 07:41.240
of life here on Earth is a result of panspermia. Millions and millions of years ago, Mars had

07:41.240 --> 07:47.280
life, whether this was single cellular or multicellular, we don't know. But if panspermia

07:47.280 --> 07:53.120
occurred, that means an asteroid or a meteor or something large impacted Mars' surface.

07:53.120 --> 07:59.160
This kicked up much Martian soil and dust containing microbes. That dust and particles

07:59.160 --> 08:03.760
then made their way over to Earth, where the seeds of life were carried from one planet

08:03.760 --> 08:11.200
to another. There are three types of panspermia, lithopanspermia, which means life being carried

08:11.200 --> 08:17.080
from one solar system to another, ballistic panspermia, which is life carried from one

08:17.080 --> 08:23.840
planet to another within the same solar system, and directed panspermia. This would be human

08:23.840 --> 08:31.600
sending life to other planets, essentially. The Men in Black are a shadowy organization

08:31.600 --> 08:39.280
featured prominently in Ufology and UFO folklore. Essentially, the Men in Black are suit clad

08:39.280 --> 08:46.520
government agents who are used to question, interrogate, threaten, harass, and sometimes

08:46.520 --> 08:53.240
assassinate, experiencers of UFOs and extraterrestrials.

08:53.240 --> 09:00.800
The legend of the Men in Black can be traced back to June 27, 1947. Harold Dahl was on

09:00.800 --> 09:05.400
a conservation mission on the Puget Sound near the eastern shore of Washington's Mowry

09:05.400 --> 09:10.760
Island. I believe he was gathering logs or just doing some outdoor work when he saw six

09:10.760 --> 09:17.000
donut-shaped obstacles hovering about half a mile above his boat. Some debris fell from

09:17.000 --> 09:23.040
the obstacles, a piece of which struck and killed his dog. Dahl was able to take pictures

09:23.040 --> 09:29.280
of the craft and record some footage. The following day, Dahl was visited by a man in

09:29.280 --> 09:35.760
a black suit. The two had to a local diner where the man was able to recount in extreme

09:35.760 --> 09:41.640
detail what Dahl had witnessed the night before. The man said, quote, what I have said to

09:41.640 --> 09:46.320
you is proof to you that I know a great deal more about this experience of yours than you

09:46.320 --> 09:52.680
will want to believe. Dahl was then told not to speak of the incident. If he did, bad things

09:52.680 --> 09:59.400
would happen. As a final statement on the Men in Black, I'd like to say that these

09:59.400 --> 10:04.400
guys don't always need to be in suits, okay? What you could consider the Men in Black,

10:04.400 --> 10:10.160
people opposing any sort of discussion or sharing of information or footage of UFOs could

10:10.160 --> 10:15.160
also just be described as men in military fatigues. This is what happened during the

10:15.160 --> 10:20.960
Roswell incident with Jesse Marcell and the girl whose fireman father witnessed the crash

10:20.960 --> 10:27.680
craft as well as Lieutenant Robert Jacobs in his footage of a UFO disabling a nuclear

10:27.680 --> 10:32.960
warhead. So the men can be in suits. That dives a little bit more into the paranormal

10:32.960 --> 10:38.640
and weird things or just men in military fatigues blocking any sort of conversation or spreading

10:38.640 --> 10:44.840
of information. I would like to mention I think these suit clad men in black are a total

10:44.840 --> 10:53.400
hoax and distract from the actual validity of people within the United States government

10:53.400 --> 10:59.280
and high ranking officials trying to stop the spread of legitimate UFO sightings and

10:59.280 --> 11:08.040
footage. So I am not a fan of the suit clad men in black. I think it's a little bit ridiculous.

11:08.040 --> 11:13.480
The Nazca lines. If you have seen ancient aliens on the history channel, I'm willing

11:13.480 --> 11:20.800
to bet you have heard of the Nazca lines. If not, no worries. I got you. The Nazca lines

11:20.800 --> 11:26.520
are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca desert near southern Peru. It's

11:26.520 --> 11:33.960
estimated that most of these pictures depicting animals were created between 500 BC and 500

11:33.960 --> 11:40.440
AD. These large geoglyphs were made by making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert

11:40.440 --> 11:47.600
floor, removing stones and pebbles, and leaving different colored dirt to be exposed. Now

11:47.600 --> 11:52.960
seen from the ground, the Nazca lines appear as nothing more than lines. But when viewed

11:52.960 --> 11:58.520
from an aerial position, the Nazca lines then start to depict the beautiful creatures

11:58.520 --> 12:03.920
that they're made to represent. While it's highly likely that the Nazca lines were used

12:03.920 --> 12:09.440
for ancient religious purposes, such as offerings to gods who would be able to see the lines

12:09.440 --> 12:16.480
from the heavens or other varying rituals, author Eric Von Daniken in his book Chariots

12:17.480 --> 12:25.400
1968 proposed that the Nazca lines were in fact used as landing sites for UFOs. He theorized

12:25.400 --> 12:31.200
that the shapes and lines were made by extraterrestrials and were created to help steer their spaceships

12:31.200 --> 12:36.480
to land safely. Von Daniken claimed the patterns at the site looked very similar to modern

12:36.480 --> 12:43.040
airport designs and used this as pieces of evidence to prove that extraterrestrials

12:43.120 --> 12:49.760
used this Nazca plane as a landing space for their spacecraft. I of course favor the prosaic

12:49.760 --> 12:55.200
explanation here. I think the Nazca lines were likely used for religious purposes and are also

12:55.200 --> 13:00.800
observable from nearby hills and mountains, not just from the air, from airplanes or spacecraft.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.560
But it is fun to think about the ancient astronaut theory, I mean that's why ancient aliens has

13:06.560 --> 13:15.840
like 30 seasons. The Betty and Barney Hill Incident is one of the most famous alien abduction

13:15.840 --> 13:26.000
stories in US history. Their story begins at around 1030 on September 19th 1961. The couple

13:26.000 --> 13:31.840
was driving back from a vacation near Niagara Falls in Montreal just south of Lancaster, New

13:31.840 --> 13:39.360
Hampshire. Upon driving, Betty observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved just below

13:39.360 --> 13:45.840
the moon and the planet Jupiter. Betty noticed the light moved erratically and grew bigger and

13:45.840 --> 13:52.000
brighter at various times, and Betty urged Barney to stop the car so the two could take a closer

13:52.000 --> 13:58.400
look. Through binoculars, Betty noticed an odd shaped craft travel across the face of the moon

13:58.400 --> 14:04.800
with flashing multicolored lights. Initially, Barney thought this may have been a commercial

14:04.800 --> 14:11.600
airliner, but as the craft turned towards him and started rapidly descending, he quickly changed his

14:11.600 --> 14:19.440
mind. The couple then continued driving, observing the well illuminated craft moving erratically

14:19.440 --> 14:25.360
back and forth in the night sky. The object rapidly descended toward the hill's vehicle,

14:25.440 --> 14:30.400
causing Barney to stop the car in the middle of the highway. The silent craft hovered about

14:30.400 --> 14:38.240
80 to 100 feet above them, reminding Barney of a large pancake. Barney then claimed to have seen

14:38.240 --> 14:44.080
8 to 11 humanoid figures who were all peering out of the craft's windows looking at him.

14:44.880 --> 14:49.760
All but one figure then retreated back into the craft. The one remaining figure

14:50.560 --> 14:54.000
communicated with Barney telepathically, giving him a message saying,

14:54.000 --> 15:00.560
quote, Stay where you are and keep looking, end quote. Now it's worth mentioning that later on

15:00.560 --> 15:06.320
when Barney reported this abduction to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena,

15:06.320 --> 15:14.960
NICAP, he explicitly stated, quote, Beans were somehow not human. Red lights then began to

15:15.040 --> 15:20.240
telescope out of the sides of the craft and a long structure descended from the bottom of the

15:20.240 --> 15:28.320
craft, approaching Barney. The couple then arrived home, perplexed, noticing that their memories

15:28.320 --> 15:36.160
became incomplete and fragmented after observing the craft buzzing towards them. About 10 days

15:36.160 --> 15:43.120
after the incident, Betty began having strange vivid dreams for five successive nights. Within

15:43.120 --> 15:50.080
these dreams, she was escorted by small humanoids five to five feet four inches tall with Barney

15:50.080 --> 15:57.920
walking behind her. She recalls after being walked with the humanoids being set back by her car,

15:57.920 --> 16:04.400
where the leader suggests they wait for the craft's departure. The hills then sought hypnosis to

16:04.400 --> 16:10.240
explain their missing time after their encounter. Seen as their 178 mile drive home from their

16:10.240 --> 16:16.400
vacation should have taken about four hours, but their drive took seven, meaning there were three

16:16.400 --> 16:22.880
hours of missing time where they could not explain what happened. Barney's first session of hypnosis

16:22.880 --> 16:30.880
is extremely disturbing. He recalls running from the UFO back to his car. He recalls driving away

16:30.880 --> 16:36.960
from the UFO, but felt an irresistible urge to pull off the road and drive into the woods.

16:37.920 --> 16:44.560
Upon doing so, he cited six figures standing on the dirt road. He described these figures

16:44.560 --> 16:50.800
very similar to what occurred in Betty's dreams. Barney said the beans stared into his eyes with

16:50.800 --> 17:00.480
a terrifying effect. Barney said, quote, Oh, those eyes, they're in my brain. And, quote, I was told

17:00.480 --> 17:05.920
to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mind. And I felt like the eyes had pushed

17:05.920 --> 17:13.120
into my eyes, end quote. And finally, quote, All I see are these eyes. I'm not even afraid that

17:13.120 --> 17:17.840
they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing

17:17.840 --> 17:25.360
against my eyes, end quote. Betty's recollections from hypnosis were remarkably similar to Barney's.

17:26.240 --> 17:32.560
In her hypnosis session, she recalls being aboard the craft, talking about the technology she saw

17:32.560 --> 17:39.040
and a star map she observed within what she guessed was the craft's control room. Now,

17:39.040 --> 17:45.120
this star map is pretty controversial, as some interpretations show it bearing soul, our sun,

17:45.120 --> 17:50.480
as well as the creatures coming from the Zeta reticuli system. And there has been a back and

17:50.480 --> 17:56.880
forth into this star maps authenticity, including a rebuttal by Carl Sagan in the 1980s cosmos.

17:56.880 --> 18:02.080
But even members on the Condon UFO report, as mentioned earlier, said the odds of this being

18:02.080 --> 18:09.200
a random configuration of stars were quote, at least 1000 to one against, end quote. There's a

18:09.200 --> 18:13.840
lot more to the Betty and Barney Hill incident, a lot more to study and a lot more to talk about.

18:13.840 --> 18:17.760
I can't give it justice in this couple minute segment, but that's a brief overview.

18:19.920 --> 18:26.480
Rawleism is a UFO religion dating back to the 70s in France, founded by Claude Vorihon.

18:27.440 --> 18:33.200
The religion teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity

18:33.200 --> 18:39.440
using their advanced technology. Now, key historical and religious figures such as Buddha, Jesus,

18:39.440 --> 18:45.440
and Muhammad have been mistaken for gods throughout history, even though they were just Elohim.

18:46.080 --> 18:52.240
The Elohim created 40 human Elohim hybrids who have served as prophets throughout the history

18:52.560 --> 18:59.120
of humanity. The religion believes that since the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, humanity has entered

18:59.120 --> 19:05.600
an age of apocalypse and will destroy itself with nuclear annihilation unless it finds a way to

19:05.600 --> 19:12.960
peacefully harness these technological developments. Because of this upcoming apocalypse, the Rawleians

19:12.960 --> 19:18.080
have sought to build an embassy for the Elohim that incorporates a landing pad for their spaceship.

19:19.040 --> 19:24.480
This religion slash cult isn't harming anybody, so it's kind of fun to read about,

19:24.480 --> 19:30.320
and it's not as dangerous as some other UFO death cult. So yeah, fun little read.

19:33.120 --> 19:39.040
The Kardashev Scale is a fascinating method of measuring the civilization's level of technological

19:39.040 --> 19:44.240
advancement based on the amount of energy the civilization is capable of harnessing.

19:45.200 --> 19:51.520
The Kardashev Scale was first proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.640
There are traditionally three types of Kardashev civilizations.

19:57.360 --> 20:02.960
Type one, a planetary civilization, is able to harness all available energy from their

20:02.960 --> 20:09.040
planetary system. This gives the civilization control over the entire planet's natural forces,

20:09.120 --> 20:15.840
including weather and other various phenomena. A type two is a stellar civilization, a civilization

20:15.840 --> 20:21.840
that is able to harness all available energy from their host, star. This is done through

20:21.840 --> 20:27.280
hypothetical methods such as a Dyson Sphere, which we'll touch on later. And the type two

20:27.280 --> 20:33.600
civilization is able to occupy other planets and other moons within their system. Finally,

20:33.600 --> 20:40.000
a type three civilization is known as a galactic civilization. A galactic civilization is able to

20:40.000 --> 20:46.880
control energy on the scale of their entire host galaxy. Type three civilizations are able to travel

20:46.880 --> 20:55.520
across, stars to stars, and colonize their entire home galaxy. Now the Kardashev Scale increases

20:55.520 --> 21:01.280
to a Kardashev four and a Kardashev five, in which a civilization is able to control the total

21:01.280 --> 21:08.480
energy output of a galactic cluster, and a type five where the civilization can control the energy

21:08.480 --> 21:14.560
output of an entire universe, but we don't know if that's theoretically possible. You may ask

21:14.560 --> 21:21.680
yourself where does Earth and humans fall on the Kardashev Scale? We are currently about a 0.7

21:22.400 --> 21:30.480
rating on the Kardashev Scale. The Phoenix Lights refers to a mass UFO sighting in a boomerang or

21:30.480 --> 21:39.520
V formation over Phoenix, Arizona in March 13 1997, and persists as one of the largest and most

21:39.520 --> 21:47.280
perplexing mass sightings of a UFO in US history. The sightings of hundreds of people are often

21:47.280 --> 21:53.120
explained away by the official narrative that these sightings was due to flares and flying

21:53.200 --> 22:00.480
formations of A-10 Thunderbolt 2 aircrafts. But the governor of Arizona himself,

22:00.480 --> 22:06.160
Fife Simen, observed the event and attempted to make an official inquiry, but was denied.

22:06.160 --> 22:12.160
He's quoted as saying, quote, I'm a pilot, and I know just about every machine that flies.

22:12.160 --> 22:17.760
It was bigger than anything I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it,

22:17.760 --> 22:25.680
responsible people. In 2017, Simington also wrote an editorial piece for CNN which he further

22:25.680 --> 22:31.040
discussed his experience with the Phoenix Lights. He said he observed a large delta-shaped craft

22:31.040 --> 22:35.920
which moved silently in the sky. He said it was dramatically large with, quote,

22:35.920 --> 22:42.240
very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights, end quote. He expressed his dissatisfaction

22:42.240 --> 22:50.400
in the Air Force's official explanation of test flares and claimed he did in fact see a large craft.

22:52.080 --> 22:58.720
The truth here, I'm not sure. The flare explanation can be valid for some sightings such as Jeremy

22:58.720 --> 23:05.280
Corbell's Palm Spring UFO footage in 2023. But due to the witness testimony of hundreds of people,

23:05.280 --> 23:11.200
including the governor of Arizona himself, I'm not sure we can rule out the possibility a strange

23:11.280 --> 23:14.960
and anomalous craft flew over the city of Phoenix, Arizona.

23:17.440 --> 23:22.960
The Battle of Los Angeles is a famous event that occurred in the city of Los Angeles, California,

23:22.960 --> 23:31.200
on late February the 24th of 1942. Fresh off of the attack on Pearl Harbor and entry into World War

23:31.200 --> 23:37.120
II, the U.S.'s war nerves were at a relative all-time high, expecting any time an attack from

23:37.120 --> 23:43.280
Japan on the western coast. Over a number of hours, multiple radar signatures were detected,

23:43.280 --> 23:49.600
sending the local military into a scramble. An impending threat of attack by the Japanese was

23:49.600 --> 23:56.160
expected, prompting an aerial bombardment. One quote from the scene says, quote,

23:56.160 --> 24:02.880
the air erupted like a volcano, end quote. Five civilians died in the aerial bombardment,

24:02.880 --> 24:09.520
three from car accidents, two from heart attacks. But later on, it was determined that the reasoning

24:09.520 --> 24:17.680
behind the aerial bombardment was war nerves or a meteorological balloon. A photo was then published

24:17.680 --> 24:25.920
in the LA Times on February 26th of 1942. The photo show searched lights focused on what looks to be

24:26.000 --> 24:33.840
a saucer-type spacecraft. However, it's controversial that this photo may have been altered,

24:33.840 --> 24:39.600
heavily altered, and thus might not be an actual representation of what exactly the search lights

24:39.600 --> 24:45.520
and artillery cannons were shooting at. But this is an interesting story. The Battle of Los Angeles

24:45.520 --> 24:51.600
is actually one of the cases that got me into the study of UFOs as a young kid. Nowadays, I don't

24:51.600 --> 24:56.560
think it's that interesting. I think that there's probably a likely prosaic explanation here, but

24:57.360 --> 25:01.680
I have a lot of nostalgia for this case. But interesting nonetheless.

25:05.440 --> 25:12.160
The reptilian theory is a conspiracy theory that was proposed by David Ike. Essentially,

25:12.160 --> 25:19.840
the reptilian theory talks of a shape-shifting reptilian race of aliens that is evil and slowly

25:19.840 --> 25:27.200
taking control of Earth by taking on human form and gaining political or social power to manipulate

25:27.200 --> 25:36.480
human entities. First introduced in 1999 in Ike's book The Big Secret, reptilians are tall, blood

25:36.480 --> 25:43.040
drinking, shape-shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconi star system hiding in

25:43.040 --> 25:48.960
underground bases and in plain sight. These reptiles have a conspiracy against humanity,

25:48.960 --> 25:54.880
whether that means to take over the world, subjugate humanity, or whatever. I'm not quite

25:54.880 --> 26:01.760
sure, but numerous people including the Rothschilds, Bush, and British royal family are reptiles,

26:01.760 --> 26:09.360
according to Ike. There are up to six. The reptilian theory has become one of the world's most popular

26:09.360 --> 26:14.240
conspiracy theories, with many internet users trying to find videos of political leaders

26:14.240 --> 26:20.240
that have discrepancies in their eyes or lizard eyes, as well as a lot of public places leaning

26:20.240 --> 26:24.800
into the conspiracy. For example, I live in Denver, and the Denver International Airport,

26:24.800 --> 26:29.200
which has been shrouded in conspiracy, has really leaned into the whole reptilian thing with a lot

26:29.200 --> 26:39.040
of posters of reptiles and such. The Pentagon UFO videos finally were eaten. The Pentagon UFO videos

26:39.040 --> 26:45.920
refer to a series of three videos taken by the DoD, Air Force, or military regarding UFOs that

26:45.920 --> 26:51.920
were classified, but released due to the efforts of Llewella Zondo and Chris Mellon, and published

26:51.920 --> 26:58.800
via The New York Times with Leslie Keane and Ralph Blumenthal. These three videos show anomalous

26:58.800 --> 27:05.040
craft taken on FLIR footage, labeled Go Fast, Gimbal, and FLIR.

27:12.240 --> 27:18.400
I'd like to focus on the Gimbal video as shown here, which was taken in 2015 off the coast of

27:18.400 --> 27:25.040
Florida. A targeting pod on an F-A-18 captured this anomalous object, which the pilot said was

27:25.040 --> 27:32.320
able to move with no visible propulsion method and stand stationary in severe winds.

27:33.680 --> 27:38.400
Now, unfortunately, there's a clip in part of this video that has not been declassified,

27:39.040 --> 27:44.160
and this is confirmed by the pilots who recorded this video, as well as Christopher Mellon. But

27:44.160 --> 27:50.400
within the rest of the video, this craft rendezvous with a series of other crafts and takes a V

27:50.400 --> 27:56.640
formation. That's extremely strange, and I would give anything to be able to see that footage, but

27:57.760 --> 28:05.760
clown debunkers like Mick West like to claim that the Gimbal video is a bird, or a jet moving

28:05.760 --> 28:12.560
away from the F-A-18, and thus is a lens artifact on the FLIR footage. I like to trust the eyes of

28:12.560 --> 28:18.320
the trained pilots who have recorded these videos, not some dude who sits in his basement and tries

28:18.320 --> 28:24.640
to debunk every single thing that ever exists on UFOs. So, very curious video. I love this. This

28:24.640 --> 28:33.920
is a classic. All three are classics. Area 51. Now, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on Area 51,

28:33.920 --> 28:40.400
because I know all of you have heard of it, and I'd like to make a video itself on Area 51, but

28:41.120 --> 28:47.600
we'll give a summary. Area 51 is the common name for a highly classified U.S. Air Force base

28:47.600 --> 28:56.320
in the Nevada desert, near Groom Lake and former nuclear test ranges. For decades, Area 51 went

28:56.320 --> 29:03.280
unacknowledged and was associated with conspiracies of UFOs and experimental aircrafts. In fact,

29:03.280 --> 29:10.640
Area 51 wasn't officially acknowledged until 2013, where the CIA publicly acknowledged the base

29:10.640 --> 29:17.200
through a Freedom of Information Act request. Many believe that Area 51 isn't just home to

29:17.200 --> 29:22.800
experimental aircraft tests like the U-2 tests and reverse engineering foreign adversaries like

29:22.800 --> 29:29.760
the MiG jets, but is also housed for reverse engineering and test flights of UFOs. While I

29:29.760 --> 29:35.280
don't really want to cover that on this video, I will leave you with this. Pictured on screen is a

29:35.280 --> 29:43.520
project patch from Area 51, supplied by Eric Tabor. Eric Tabor is an official UFO whistleblower who

29:43.520 --> 29:50.800
submitted a memorandum for record to Arrow, the all-domain anomaly resolution office, that this

29:50.800 --> 29:56.480
patch belonged to his great uncle, Sam Yerkuhart. I'm not sure how to pronounce his name, it's a

29:56.480 --> 30:03.200
little tough to spell. But his great uncle divulged to him that while working at Area 51 as a contractor,

30:03.200 --> 30:09.920
he was privy to learn that the base housed an egg-shaped UFO that was found intact in the

30:09.920 --> 30:15.840
Nevada desert. It's worth noting that Sam was the head of security for an engineering group,

30:15.840 --> 30:21.440
the radar cross-section training team, so it's not wild to think he was privy to some strange

30:21.440 --> 30:27.760
information. True or not, this is extremely interesting as Tabor has submitted a legal document

30:27.760 --> 30:37.040
to Arrow testifying that this is, in fact, true. So maybe Area 51 has housed UFOs. But we'll save

30:37.120 --> 30:45.520
that for another time. The Nordic aliens are a supposed race of extraterrestrial humanoids

30:45.520 --> 30:52.720
who come from the Pallades system and resemble Nordic Scandinavians. The Nordics are often

30:52.720 --> 30:59.840
taller than regular humans, six to seven feet tall, have blue eyes, fair skin, and long blonde hair.

31:00.800 --> 31:07.760
Throughout the 1950s, many people alleged to have encounters with the Nordic aliens claiming they

31:07.760 --> 31:15.040
were benevolent and magical, often caring about humans and the world's prosperity. The Nordics

31:15.040 --> 31:23.280
were able to communicate with humans via telepathy and possessed a cool calming demeanor that proved

31:23.280 --> 31:31.920
to be youthful, affectionate, and kind. The Nordic aliens are part of a galactic federation

31:32.560 --> 31:36.720
and traverse the cosmos from their spherical to cigar shaped crafts.

31:38.480 --> 31:43.360
Interestingly enough, if you've heard of the abduction case of Travis Walton, a film was made

31:43.360 --> 31:48.320
about him called Fire in the Sky, I'd recommend checking it out. But Travis Walton has a very

31:48.320 --> 31:54.640
curious abduction story that has a lot of intriguing aspects to it, let's just say that.

31:55.200 --> 32:01.520
And from his testimony, when he's taken aboard a UFO craft, he encounters several types of beings,

32:01.520 --> 32:06.960
such as the common graze, including a Nordic like race of tall humanoids.

32:08.080 --> 32:15.680
Are the Nordic aliens real? I don't know. I don't like to focus too much on abduction stories or

32:16.320 --> 32:22.400
extraterrestrial races. I just like to focus on the fact there is something in our sky that's of

32:22.400 --> 32:27.280
non human intelligence or multiple things in the sky of non human intelligence and start there.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.760
We got a lot to work through before we start deciphering what exactly these things are if

32:31.760 --> 32:40.240
they're even extraterrestrials. The graze are the archetypal extraterrestrial and most famous

32:40.240 --> 32:48.160
depiction of extraterrestrials ever. Often just referred to as graze, graze are typically gray

32:48.160 --> 32:55.120
skinned, small humanoid beings between three and five feet tall, completely hairless,

32:55.120 --> 33:02.240
with enlarged heads, sometimes a small slit like mouth, sometimes no mouth, sometimes just nostrils,

33:02.240 --> 33:11.440
sometimes no nostrils, and large black piercing eyes. The graze often lack muscular definition

33:11.440 --> 33:18.240
and have a visible skeletal structure. I want to stress with their head size, their head is usually

33:18.240 --> 33:27.200
comically larger than their body. Now the gray can possibly be traced all the way back to 1917,

33:27.200 --> 33:33.680
where occultist Aleister Crowley performed a black magic ritual and was able to contact a

33:33.680 --> 33:42.080
bean named Lamb across space and dimensions. But I like to look at the fact the graze really became

33:42.080 --> 33:49.600
popular in the 1947 Roswell crash. These were the supposed beans that were found dead or dying by

33:49.600 --> 33:54.720
their crashed craft a little bit northwest of Roswell, New Mexico. I'd like to make a long

33:54.720 --> 34:00.720
video on Roswell because it's fascinating, but also remember Betty and Barney Hill. These small

34:00.720 --> 34:06.720
humanoid beings match the depiction of graze as well. In fact, graze are so commonly involved with

34:06.720 --> 34:12.720
alien abductions. Graze make up about 50% of claimed abductions or sightings in Australia,

34:13.360 --> 34:20.000
73% in the US, 48% in continental Europe, and 12% around the UK.

34:20.160 --> 34:26.640
There are many interesting theories about what exactly the gray is, some of them being the

34:26.640 --> 34:32.640
graze are basically biological drones utilized by other extraterrestrial civilizations.

34:32.640 --> 34:38.960
Graze are often described as emotionless, kind of hive-minded and worker bees, so this could imply

34:38.960 --> 34:45.840
that they're just biological drones. Graze sometimes are often associated with future humans

34:45.840 --> 34:52.080
as well, claiming that as humans evolve we rely less on our muscles, spend more time indoors,

34:52.720 --> 34:57.520
receive more receding hair across our bodies, get enlarged eyes from looking at screens.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.440
And that's interesting to think about too. I'm not sure about that I like it, but

35:02.000 --> 35:07.840
also that graze are just humanoid figures that evolved on a planet with somewhat similar conditions

35:07.840 --> 35:15.040
to Earth. Regardless of where they originate, the graze are fascinating and I somewhat believe

35:15.760 --> 35:20.560
some sort of non-human intelligence on this planet resembles the classic gray.

35:22.800 --> 35:28.160
Little green men, I'm not going to spend time on this one, especially since little green men are

35:28.160 --> 35:35.760
essentially green graze, and the term little green men is often used by politicians to kind of shrug

35:35.760 --> 35:42.960
off and make fun of any UAP or UFO sightings. You'll often time see Pentagon conversations or

35:42.960 --> 35:49.520
official military talks when talking about UFOs, say we found no evidence of little green men,

35:49.520 --> 35:55.040
so I just have no interest entertaining this entry. I understand I'm getting a little bit

35:55.040 --> 36:04.000
pressed about this, but yeah, I stop here. Hoya Bashu is essentially the most haunted

36:04.000 --> 36:11.280
forest in the world. It's nestled in Romania and has many unexplicable and strange phenomena such

36:11.360 --> 36:19.440
as UFO sightings. I've never heard of this forest. I really don't have much to say about this entry

36:19.440 --> 36:25.360
besides apparently in the 1960s there have been UFO sightings in the forest and images taken.

36:27.520 --> 36:36.080
And lastly we have the 1952 Washington DC UFO incident. This mass sighting of UFOs occurred

36:36.080 --> 36:44.800
over the weeks of July 19th through the 20th and July 26th through the 27th of 1952. At 11.40 pm

36:44.800 --> 36:51.760
on Saturday July 19th 52 Edward Nugent an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport

36:51.760 --> 36:58.000
spotted seven objects on his radar. He knew immediately that this was a very strange situation

36:58.000 --> 37:04.640
as the crafts moved erratically compared to any normal aircraft. Nearby two controllers at the

37:04.640 --> 37:10.880
national airport's radar equipped control tower looked outside and saw a hovering bright light in

37:10.880 --> 37:17.760
the sky which departed at incredible speeds. At this point other objects appeared in all

37:17.760 --> 37:25.040
sections of the radar scopes and they moved over the White House the U.S.'s capital. Jets were

37:25.040 --> 37:32.640
scrambled from nearby Newcastle Air Force Base in Delaware to investigate the six fast moving

37:32.640 --> 37:38.400
bright lights over the nation's capital. The jets found no such objects they eventually ran

37:38.400 --> 37:46.240
out of fuel and had to return to their bases. Later on on July 26th 1952 the event occurred

37:46.240 --> 37:51.920
again where a pilot and stewardess on a national airline's flight into Washington DC

37:51.920 --> 37:57.600
observed erratic moving lights above their aircraft. Within minutes both radar centers at

37:57.600 --> 38:04.960
national airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked the objects. The occurrence made front page

38:04.960 --> 38:11.760
headlines and caused a great deal of concern for President Harry Truman who made personal calls

38:11.760 --> 38:17.680
to his Air Force aides to find out what the heck happened as well as garnered much CIA interest.

38:18.880 --> 38:25.440
In response to this event the Robertson panel was formed to quote strip the unidentified flying

38:25.440 --> 38:29.920
objects of their special status they have been given in the aura of mystery they have

38:29.920 --> 38:37.840
unfortunately acquired end quote. So the 1952 UFOs over DC directly leads to the decades long

38:38.400 --> 38:42.320
stigma around UFOs and this is very interesting and I'll make another video about this.

38:44.800 --> 38:51.760
Well my friends that is layer one to the alien and UFO obscure oddities iceberg. I hope everybody

38:51.760 --> 38:56.480
enjoyed this first layer a ton of interesting entries looking down the list we're going to have

38:56.480 --> 39:03.120
a lot more extremely interesting things to cover and I cannot wait. Remember if you liked the video

39:03.120 --> 39:09.040
consider tossing out a subscription and a like doesn't cost you nothing and it allows me to

39:09.040 --> 39:15.440
make more interesting videos like this so stay tuned friends I'm going to start part two immediately.
