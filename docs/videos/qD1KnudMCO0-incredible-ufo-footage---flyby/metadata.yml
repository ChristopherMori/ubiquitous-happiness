description: "JOIN THE UAPGERB DISCORD: https://discord.gg/VZAw9sjXKd\n\nGuys, I wanted\
  \ to try and perform a critical analysis on one of my favorite alleged pieces of\
  \ UFO footage - the FLYBY footage. This film of a UFO traveling near the wing of\
  \ an F/A-18 Super Hornet first mysteriously appeared in 2008 and has BAFFLED me\
  \ since I first discovered it around 2015.\n\nThe footage depicts a saucer-shaped\
  \ UFO flying directly off the wing type of the jet and displays 3 of the 5 characteristics\
  \ of Lue Elizondo's UAP characteristics:\n1. No visible means of propulsion\n2.\
  \ Instant Acceleration\n3. Antigravity\n\nIf true, this footage is hands down the\
  \ BEST available UFO footage in the public realm! But is it?.... We will analyze\
  \ the footage context, sound, craft shape, and a mysterious document that sends\
  \ us down a rabbit hole I never would've thought existed when I began covering this\
  \ case! \n\nPlease enjoy my breakdown of the FLYBY footage!\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:40\
