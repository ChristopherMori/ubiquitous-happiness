0	8320	On May 14th, 2008, a perplexing and enigmatic 20-second clip supposedly depicting a disc-shaped
8320	14220	UFO moving alongside a jet appeared out of the blue on YouTube.
14220	19540	This video was uploaded by a long-dead channel titled Danny Lampkin.
19540	25020	In the video description, Lampkin says one simple sentence, quote, I'm not too sure
25020	31020	about this one, but I thought I would download it anyway, for you to decide.
31020	54820	Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now.
54820	58640	This video is far too fantastic to be true.
58640	60220	The quality is garbage.
60220	64280	This is bad CGI or just a model on a string.
64280	70320	But this footage is far more complex and insinulating than initially meets the eye.
70320	75800	Let's dive in and try to determine the authenticity of the flyby UFO footage.
75800	77960	Guys, welcome back to the channel.
77960	79680	I'm your host, UAPGurb.
79680	84320	Let's dive right into this today because I want to dissect one of my favorite pieces
84320	89340	of UFO footage that has kept me pondering for the better part of a decade, the flyby
89340	90780	footage.
90780	97660	If this footage is the real deal, it is the best example of a closely filmed UFO encounter
97660	101020	in the entire public realm.
101020	105980	Former ATIP director Lou Elizondo once stated there is UFO footage leaked to the public
105980	110080	realm that he was shocked had not broken global news.
110080	114740	We can only assume this footage has been seen but labelled fake or skipped over by
114740	118380	the UFO community and internet at large.
118380	124340	During an interview with GQ in 2021, when asked about the gimbal GoFast and UFO Pentagon
124340	129220	videos, Lou stated that these three videos were some of the least compelling out there
129220	133860	and that quote, there's videos out there in government that the public haven't seen
133860	134860	yet.
134860	137660	There's one that's 23 minutes long.
137660	141760	There's another one where this thing is 50 feet away from the cockpit.
141760	143400	I mean, it ain't ours.
143400	144400	We know that.
144400	147120	Sometimes, you just couldn't believe it.
147120	151120	99% sure it's not foreign adversarial technology.
151120	154480	So that only leaves really one other option.
154480	156440	It's someone or something else.
156440	160840	Are these three videos the only videos that you know of that the United States government
160840	164160	has that shows an identified aerial phenomenon?
164160	165600	No, absolutely not.
165600	168420	These are probably some of the least compelling videos.
168420	172340	Some cases, you know, we've seen these things 50 feet away from the cockpit.
172340	177500	On a Joe Rogan experience appearance, Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary
177500	183020	of defense, staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he had seen footage of a
183020	185620	UAP right next to a pilot.
185620	191900	I'm not sure if this is the same footage Lou is referencing, but I am 100% positive
191900	196640	the footage Mellon was referring to is not the fly by footage.
196640	200000	But we are now faced with the mind melting fact.
200000	206240	There are real instances of UFOs traveling within 15 meters of aircraft.
206240	208280	So let's start to break down this clip.
208280	213760	I can only trace this case back to around April of 2008, where it was posted on the
213760	220840	UFO Chronicles dot com titled, quote, flying saucer UFO film from jet window.
220840	225060	The video then began popping up onto YouTube around May 2008.
225060	229900	Unfortunately, I cannot find any record of this clip before April of 2008.
229900	236900	So this is where our trail starts.
236900	241780	At a brief glance, we can see this video is certainly under 240p.
241780	247300	But what we are actually looking at is a recording of a screen, meaning someone recorded the
247300	249960	original footage playing on a computer screen.
249960	252880	So this is a second generation recording.
252880	257320	If we look closely, we can see the reflection of equipment.
257320	261960	One possibility is the reflection of the camera utilized to record the camera screen.
261960	267520	More likely, however, these are reflections of possible objects within the plane's cockpit
267520	269760	reflecting against the glass.
269760	274560	This would likely be a camcorder positioned inside the cockpit with possible additional
274560	284060	reflective catches of a GenTek's MBU-23P pilot respirator mask.
284060	289140	Following these possibilities, we must now consider this footage is taken from inside
289140	292140	a military jet and not commercial airliner.
292140	297500	Well, one such craft exists that has an interior mounted camera.
297500	301900	The NASA F-18 variant, the NASA Chase F-18A.
301900	307480	As seen here, the jet has a mounted camcorder behind the pilot seat, able to film starboard
307480	310200	or portside without obstruction.
310200	316040	In our video, we see what looks to be a jet wing filmed portside with empty missile wingtip
316040	317480	pylons.
317480	321680	Take a look at this cockpit view of an F-18 Super Hornet.
321680	328240	The wing angle matches and so do the wingtip pylons.
328240	334020	Okay, what about the audio of this footage?
334020	339780	We can hear a loud, muffly noise and possibly human voices within the video.
339780	341820	I see two possibilities here.
341820	347700	One, the footage features original sound recorded from the pilot, played back on a device, and
347700	351660	re-recorded from the secondary camera recording the computer screen.
351660	357380	The audio could be pure or combined with ambient background noise from the computer recording.
357380	362200	Or two, ambient sounds from the screen recording location.
362200	369600	Speculating on possibility two, the audio sounds extremely similar to the 2019 US Navy
369600	375840	filmed spherical shaped UFO object going into water, posted by Jeremy Corbell, featuring
375840	378460	ambient sounds from the USS Nimitz.
378460	380460	Check out this comparison.
409460	416100	To think about possibility one, here's the ambient noise inside the cockpit of an F-18
416100	429460	Super Hornet and our footage.
429460	435400	As one Reddit user pointed out, the audio waveform does not cut at second four of our
435400	440120	video where there is a footage cut, leading credence to the possibility that whatever
440120	445120	we hear is in fact ambient noise of a ship where the screen recording was captured.
445120	450080	Lastly, audio wise, you might be able to hear faint voices in the background.
450080	454560	This same Reddit user attempted to isolate the voices and here is what they came up with.
465400	479240	I cannot even begin to guess what is being said, however.
479240	487320	This does appear to be a female voice.
487320	491360	Quickly I wanted to brush over the craft depicted in this video.
491360	496920	This UFO is almost identical to the saucer shaped craft as described by Lieutenant Jacobs
496920	499400	in his warhead shoot down footage.
499400	504720	This craft also appears to be extremely similar to some of the most famous UFO photographs
504720	507840	ever taken, the McMinnville photos.
507840	512600	Notice the protrusion on top of the craft which, as described by Jacobs, is similar to half
512600	514280	of a ping pong ball.
514280	518760	This same upper protrusion is also seen in the McMinnville images.
518760	526000	The craft here also flies at an angle, something seen in numerous saucer images and descriptions
526000	528280	of saucer encounters.
528280	535840	Controversial as he is, even Bob Lazar claimed the disc shaped craft fly quote, belly towards
535840	538960	their destination.
538960	544680	Oh boy, here we go.
545000	549920	Lastly I want to talk about the most enigmatic connection to this case.
549920	556440	In 2021 or 2022 an alleged leaked classified military communications log made its way around
556440	561120	the internet, including a post on the ever famous 4chan.
561120	566400	Now everything from 4chan must be taken with a grain of salt, but these leaked comms are
566400	571840	purportedly a page of a longer classified version of a UAP task force report prepared
571840	573440	for congress.
573440	575800	Let's break down this comms log.
575800	582360	The log details the cockpit voice recording of a fighter aircraft club 1-1 during an interception
582360	589320	directed by AWACS, airborne warning and control system call sign Brigham, which serves as
589320	594160	a flying long range radar and command center that provides tactical command services to
594160	596040	units and their network.
596040	599040	Think of eyes in the sky for fighter units.
599040	604840	And lastly BLK, unclear what this is, they do not identify themselves but they use NATO
604840	607000	brevity language.
607000	613120	The fighter is crewed by a pilot PC and weapon system operator, WSO, sitting in the back
613120	615360	and managing some systems.
615360	619160	Think back to the NASA chase F-18A, the dual seater.
619160	623720	BLK is guiding them to intercept a bogie scene on radar.
623720	628800	The fighter can't see this bogie initially, but at some point the WSO catches it in his
628800	635920	radar and tells the pilot it's coming at them at 2820 knots.
635920	639600	Electronic countermeasures are activated and the crew is alerted that a missile has been
639600	643480	launched at them or that they are being actively tracked by radar.
643480	646600	This could have been done manually or automatic.
646600	652800	The bogie gets so close that from BLK's point of view, both contacts quote merge, meaning
652800	657640	they are overlapping at the current resolution and the fighter's crew have had no visual
657640	659240	contact yet.
659240	662560	They declare the target as quote bogie dope.
662560	667080	When the crew confirms that they see nothing, they ask for further instructions from BLK
667080	669360	who tells them to stand by.
669360	675480	The crew then see an object on the starboard wing quote hanging out about 10 to 15 feet
675480	677000	from the canopy.
677000	683960	The pilot is shocked, however BLK tells them not to change velocity or vector, BLK tells
683960	688560	the crew to quote open your blue envelopes and snooze, essentially telling the crew
688560	693200	to confirm their weapons are off and then to open an envelope and proceed with briefed
693200	698200	mission control procedures which may include radio silence or channel changes.
698200	704200	The described events in this comms log line up almost exactly with the bogie scene off
704280	709000	the starboard wing of our F-A-18 in our video, does it not?
709000	711400	But is this document real?
711400	714240	And does it describe our flyby sighting?
714240	720320	Our footage's connection to this comms log starts to dive into a deep rabbit hole.
720320	722120	And stay with me here.
722120	729040	If this is indeed an online LARP, it was constructed by someone who is very familiar with Pilot
729040	730520	Lingo.
730520	734720	As we talked about, this page is purportedly a leaked page from an appendix of the longer
734720	738920	classified version of the UAP Task Force Report.
738920	744920	Look at the top of this page, Appendix F4B.13 from page 508.
744920	751080	Well, there is another alleged page from this leaked document.
751080	755400	Section 5, Behavioral Data Analysis.
755480	764480	It tells 1292 UFO cases by the joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS, and SAP-cleared experts
764480	766320	by the DOD.
766320	772560	What is absolutely insane about this document are the conclusions presented on this page
772560	779240	that some UA slash SP unidentified aerial slash submerged phenomena.
779240	782680	This in my opinion gives a little credence to the document giving the distinction between
782680	783680	aerial and submerged.
783680	791480	Anyways, that these conclusions result that UAP are either remote or autonomous drones
791480	794680	or a form of mechanical life.
794680	801320	This document asserts that an, quote, organic species has been deploying UA slash SP that
801320	808240	have seen a rapid increase in flight performance indicating a, quote, stepped virtual evolution
808240	809440	process.
809440	815480	According to one mentioned Shibakoya, gradual changes in the UA SP appearance and behavior
815480	818800	highlight generational changes.
818800	825040	I have done an exhausting search into the names mentioned on this page, M. Harman, S.
825040	831720	McCarron, and K. Shibakoya, and the, quote, blackout flower report and, quote, layer three
831720	833840	behavioral assessment.
833840	836000	But I have found almost nothing.
836000	843840	We have to assume these are pseudonyms used or first names of these people removed entirely.
843840	851000	My only luck has been able to find Juan-Hillary S. McCarron, whose LinkedIn page features
851000	857520	her as a research neuroscientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical
857520	859040	Defense.
859040	865240	As a neuroscientist, her hand featured on a page allegedly studying UFO behavior fits.
865240	871240	I'll be doing more investigation here, but guys, if I am disappeared, you know why.
871240	878640	At the bottom of the page featuring the names and reports, look at Appendix F, section 4B,
878640	885280	titled DOD 1992 through 2017 High Value Witness Interviews.
885280	892760	Real or faked, our comms log is featured in this section five behavioral data analysis.
892760	896560	These are both featured in the same allegedly leaked document.
896560	902240	The latest contribution to this report was from K. Shibakoya in 2020, and during this
902240	910120	time the UAP Task Force was still running 2017-22, so possibly this is an internal report from
910120	912240	the UAP Task Force.
912240	919400	Could this alleged report be true and subsequent Appendix comm log detail are fly by footage
919400	923440	as a quote high value witness testimony?
923440	929000	If so, that makes our fly by footage one of the most crucial pieces of UFO footage ever
929000	930500	taken.
930500	933800	But still, this footage remains so anomalous.
933800	939280	What's up guys, it's UAP Gerb, thank you for joining me today, look, I'm sorry I'm
939280	943840	a little bit disheveled, I just got back from training, but I wanted to wrap this video
943840	947000	up and see what you guys think about this fly by case.
947000	952080	I wanted to take a quick break from some of our more documentary style fact analysis and
952080	956560	do a little speculation, but you know with me we don't just speculate, we try to break
956560	958000	everything down.
958000	965880	Unfortunately I'm not a CGI expert, I have no experience in any sort of CGI or much kind
965880	972040	of in depth video editing, so if you do and you can perform an analysis on this fly by
972040	978120	footage try to determine if in fact this video has some sort of CGI, some clipping, some differential
978120	981920	frame rates between the object and the ambient picture.
981920	986440	Get in contact with me at UAPGerb at gmail.com and let me know and maybe you and I can make
986440	990880	a part two to this case and crisp it up because as it stands right now this case is incredibly
990880	995680	anomalous and as you've seen there's a pretty wild rabbit hole behind this case especially
995680	998720	with the supposed UAPTF leak document.
998720	1003800	So let me know what you think about this case, I know the footage seems a little too good
1003800	1011440	to be true, but at the end of the day we don't know if it is, very well it could be.
1011440	1015700	So thank you for joining me, remember to like and subscribe, let me know what you thought
1015700	1017360	and I will catch you guys next time.
