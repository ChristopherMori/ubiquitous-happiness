00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
On May 14th, 2008, a perplexing and enigmatic 20-second clip supposedly depicting a disc-shaped

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,220
UFO moving alongside a jet appeared out of the blue on YouTube.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,540
This video was uploaded by a long-dead channel titled Danny Lampkin.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,020
In the video description, Lampkin says one simple sentence, quote, I'm not too sure

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,020
about this one, but I thought I would download it anyway, for you to decide.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:54,820
Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now.

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,640
This video is far too fantastic to be true.

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,220
The quality is garbage.

9
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,280
This is bad CGI or just a model on a string.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,320
But this footage is far more complex and insinulating than initially meets the eye.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,800
Let's dive in and try to determine the authenticity of the flyby UFO footage.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,960
Guys, welcome back to the channel.

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm your host, UAPGurb.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,320
Let's dive right into this today because I want to dissect one of my favorite pieces

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,340
of UFO footage that has kept me pondering for the better part of a decade, the flyby

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,780
footage.

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,660
If this footage is the real deal, it is the best example of a closely filmed UFO encounter

18
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,020
in the entire public realm.

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,980
Former ATIP director Lou Elizondo once stated there is UFO footage leaked to the public

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,080
realm that he was shocked had not broken global news.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,740
We can only assume this footage has been seen but labelled fake or skipped over by

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,380
the UFO community and internet at large.

23
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,340
During an interview with GQ in 2021, when asked about the gimbal GoFast and UFO Pentagon

24
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,220
videos, Lou stated that these three videos were some of the least compelling out there

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,860
and that quote, there's videos out there in government that the public haven't seen

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
yet.

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,660
There's one that's 23 minutes long.

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,760
There's another one where this thing is 50 feet away from the cockpit.

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,400
I mean, it ain't ours.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
We know that.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
Sometimes, you just couldn't believe it.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
99% sure it's not foreign adversarial technology.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,480
So that only leaves really one other option.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,440
It's someone or something else.

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,840
Are these three videos the only videos that you know of that the United States government

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,160
has that shows an identified aerial phenomenon?

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
No, absolutely not.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,420
These are probably some of the least compelling videos.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,340
Some cases, you know, we've seen these things 50 feet away from the cockpit.

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,500
On a Joe Rogan experience appearance, Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,020
of defense, staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he had seen footage of a

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,620
UAP right next to a pilot.

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm not sure if this is the same footage Lou is referencing, but I am 100% positive

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,640
the footage Mellon was referring to is not the fly by footage.

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
But we are now faced with the mind melting fact.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,240
There are real instances of UFOs traveling within 15 meters of aircraft.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,280
So let's start to break down this clip.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,760
I can only trace this case back to around April of 2008, where it was posted on the

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,840
UFO Chronicles dot com titled, quote, flying saucer UFO film from jet window.

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,060
The video then began popping up onto YouTube around May 2008.

51
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,900
Unfortunately, I cannot find any record of this clip before April of 2008.

52
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,900
So this is where our trail starts.

53
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,780
At a brief glance, we can see this video is certainly under 240p.

54
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,300
But what we are actually looking at is a recording of a screen, meaning someone recorded the

55
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,960
original footage playing on a computer screen.

56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,880
So this is a second generation recording.

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,320
If we look closely, we can see the reflection of equipment.

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,960
One possibility is the reflection of the camera utilized to record the camera screen.

59
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,520
More likely, however, these are reflections of possible objects within the plane's cockpit

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,760
reflecting against the glass.

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,560
This would likely be a camcorder positioned inside the cockpit with possible additional

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:44,060
reflective catches of a GenTek's MBU-23P pilot respirator mask.

63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,140
Following these possibilities, we must now consider this footage is taken from inside

64
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,140
a military jet and not commercial airliner.

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,500
Well, one such craft exists that has an interior mounted camera.

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,900
The NASA F-18 variant, the NASA Chase F-18A.

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,480
As seen here, the jet has a mounted camcorder behind the pilot seat, able to film starboard

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,200
or portside without obstruction.

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,040
In our video, we see what looks to be a jet wing filmed portside with empty missile wingtip

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
pylons.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,680
Take a look at this cockpit view of an F-18 Super Hornet.

72
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,240
The wing angle matches and so do the wingtip pylons.

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,020
Okay, what about the audio of this footage?

74
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,780
We can hear a loud, muffly noise and possibly human voices within the video.

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,820
I see two possibilities here.

76
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,700
One, the footage features original sound recorded from the pilot, played back on a device, and

77
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,660
re-recorded from the secondary camera recording the computer screen.

78
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,380
The audio could be pure or combined with ambient background noise from the computer recording.

79
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,200
Or two, ambient sounds from the screen recording location.

80
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,600
Speculating on possibility two, the audio sounds extremely similar to the 2019 US Navy

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,840
filmed spherical shaped UFO object going into water, posted by Jeremy Corbell, featuring

82
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,460
ambient sounds from the USS Nimitz.

83
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,460
Check out this comparison.

84
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,100
To think about possibility one, here's the ambient noise inside the cockpit of an F-18

85
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:09,460
Super Hornet and our footage.

86
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,400
As one Reddit user pointed out, the audio waveform does not cut at second four of our

87
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,120
video where there is a footage cut, leading credence to the possibility that whatever

88
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,120
we hear is in fact ambient noise of a ship where the screen recording was captured.

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,080
Lastly, audio wise, you might be able to hear faint voices in the background.

90
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
This same Reddit user attempted to isolate the voices and here is what they came up with.

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:59,240
I cannot even begin to guess what is being said, however.

92
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:07,320
This does appear to be a female voice.

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Quickly I wanted to brush over the craft depicted in this video.

94
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,920
This UFO is almost identical to the saucer shaped craft as described by Lieutenant Jacobs

95
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,400
in his warhead shoot down footage.

96
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,720
This craft also appears to be extremely similar to some of the most famous UFO photographs

97
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
ever taken, the McMinnville photos.

98
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,600
Notice the protrusion on top of the craft which, as described by Jacobs, is similar to half

99
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,280
of a ping pong ball.

100
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,760
This same upper protrusion is also seen in the McMinnville images.

101
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:46,000
The craft here also flies at an angle, something seen in numerous saucer images and descriptions

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,280
of saucer encounters.

103
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,840
Controversial as he is, even Bob Lazar claimed the disc shaped craft fly quote, belly towards

104
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,960
their destination.

105
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,680
Oh boy, here we go.

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Lastly I want to talk about the most enigmatic connection to this case.

107
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,440
In 2021 or 2022 an alleged leaked classified military communications log made its way around

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,120
the internet, including a post on the ever famous 4chan.

109
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,400
Now everything from 4chan must be taken with a grain of salt, but these leaked comms are

110
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,840
purportedly a page of a longer classified version of a UAP task force report prepared

111
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
for congress.

112
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,800
Let's break down this comms log.

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,360
The log details the cockpit voice recording of a fighter aircraft club 1-1 during an interception

114
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,320
directed by AWACS, airborne warning and control system call sign Brigham, which serves as

115
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,160
a flying long range radar and command center that provides tactical command services to

116
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,040
units and their network.

117
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Think of eyes in the sky for fighter units.

118
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,840
And lastly BLK, unclear what this is, they do not identify themselves but they use NATO

119
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
brevity language.

120
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,120
The fighter is crewed by a pilot PC and weapon system operator, WSO, sitting in the back

121
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
and managing some systems.

122
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,160
Think back to the NASA chase F-18A, the dual seater.

123
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,720
BLK is guiding them to intercept a bogie scene on radar.

124
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,800
The fighter can't see this bogie initially, but at some point the WSO catches it in his

125
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,920
radar and tells the pilot it's coming at them at 2820 knots.

126
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,600
Electronic countermeasures are activated and the crew is alerted that a missile has been

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,480
launched at them or that they are being actively tracked by radar.

128
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,600
This could have been done manually or automatic.

129
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,800
The bogie gets so close that from BLK's point of view, both contacts quote merge, meaning

130
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,640
they are overlapping at the current resolution and the fighter's crew have had no visual

131
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,240
contact yet.

132
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,560
They declare the target as quote bogie dope.

133
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,080
When the crew confirms that they see nothing, they ask for further instructions from BLK

134
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,360
who tells them to stand by.

135
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,480
The crew then see an object on the starboard wing quote hanging out about 10 to 15 feet

136
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
from the canopy.

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,960
The pilot is shocked, however BLK tells them not to change velocity or vector, BLK tells

138
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,560
the crew to quote open your blue envelopes and snooze, essentially telling the crew

139
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,200
to confirm their weapons are off and then to open an envelope and proceed with briefed

140
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,200
mission control procedures which may include radio silence or channel changes.

141
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,200
The described events in this comms log line up almost exactly with the bogie scene off

142
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,000
the starboard wing of our F-A-18 in our video, does it not?

143
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,400
But is this document real?

144
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,240
And does it describe our flyby sighting?

145
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,320
Our footage's connection to this comms log starts to dive into a deep rabbit hole.

146
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
And stay with me here.

147
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,040
If this is indeed an online LARP, it was constructed by someone who is very familiar with Pilot

148
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,520
Lingo.

149
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,720
As we talked about, this page is purportedly a leaked page from an appendix of the longer

150
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,920
classified version of the UAP Task Force Report.

151
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Look at the top of this page, Appendix F4B.13 from page 508.

152
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,080
Well, there is another alleged page from this leaked document.

153
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,400
Section 5, Behavioral Data Analysis.

154
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:44,480
It tells 1292 UFO cases by the joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS, and SAP-cleared experts

155
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
by the DOD.

156
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,560
What is absolutely insane about this document are the conclusions presented on this page

157
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,240
that some UA slash SP unidentified aerial slash submerged phenomena.

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,680
This in my opinion gives a little credence to the document giving the distinction between

159
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
aerial and submerged.

160
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,480
Anyways, that these conclusions result that UAP are either remote or autonomous drones

161
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,680
or a form of mechanical life.

162
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,320
This document asserts that an, quote, organic species has been deploying UA slash SP that

163
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,240
have seen a rapid increase in flight performance indicating a, quote, stepped virtual evolution

164
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
process.

165
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,480
According to one mentioned Shibakoya, gradual changes in the UA SP appearance and behavior

166
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,800
highlight generational changes.

167
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,040
I have done an exhausting search into the names mentioned on this page, M. Harman, S.

168
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,720
McCarron, and K. Shibakoya, and the, quote, blackout flower report and, quote, layer three

169
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,840
behavioral assessment.

170
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,000
But I have found almost nothing.

171
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,840
We have to assume these are pseudonyms used or first names of these people removed entirely.

172
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,000
My only luck has been able to find Juan-Hillary S. McCarron, whose LinkedIn page features

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,520
her as a research neuroscientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical

174
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,040
Defense.

175
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,240
As a neuroscientist, her hand featured on a page allegedly studying UFO behavior fits.

176
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I'll be doing more investigation here, but guys, if I am disappeared, you know why.

177
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:38,640
At the bottom of the page featuring the names and reports, look at Appendix F, section 4B,

178
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,280
titled DOD 1992 through 2017 High Value Witness Interviews.

179
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,760
Real or faked, our comms log is featured in this section five behavioral data analysis.

180
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,560
These are both featured in the same allegedly leaked document.

181
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,240
The latest contribution to this report was from K. Shibakoya in 2020, and during this

182
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:10,120
time the UAP Task Force was still running 2017-22, so possibly this is an internal report from

183
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,240
the UAP Task Force.

184
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,400
Could this alleged report be true and subsequent Appendix comm log detail are fly by footage

185
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,440
as a quote high value witness testimony?

186
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,000
If so, that makes our fly by footage one of the most crucial pieces of UFO footage ever

187
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
taken.

188
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,800
But still, this footage remains so anomalous.

189
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,280
What's up guys, it's UAP Gerb, thank you for joining me today, look, I'm sorry I'm

190
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,840
a little bit disheveled, I just got back from training, but I wanted to wrap this video

191
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,000
up and see what you guys think about this fly by case.

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,080
I wanted to take a quick break from some of our more documentary style fact analysis and

193
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,560
do a little speculation, but you know with me we don't just speculate, we try to break

194
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,000
everything down.

195
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,880
Unfortunately I'm not a CGI expert, I have no experience in any sort of CGI or much kind

196
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,040
of in depth video editing, so if you do and you can perform an analysis on this fly by

197
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,120
footage try to determine if in fact this video has some sort of CGI, some clipping, some differential

198
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,920
frame rates between the object and the ambient picture.

199
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,440
Get in contact with me at UAPGerb at gmail.com and let me know and maybe you and I can make

200
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,880
a part two to this case and crisp it up because as it stands right now this case is incredibly

201
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,680
anomalous and as you've seen there's a pretty wild rabbit hole behind this case especially

202
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,720
with the supposed UAPTF leak document.

203
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,800
So let me know what you think about this case, I know the footage seems a little too good

204
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:51,440
to be true, but at the end of the day we don't know if it is, very well it could be.

205
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,700
So thank you for joining me, remember to like and subscribe, let me know what you thought

206
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,360
and I will catch you guys next time.
