1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
What is up guys? What is going on? Are we live? I think so. Let's see. Somebody let me know in

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,360
the comments if we are live and you can hear me. Okay, cool. I think we are. Let's see. David,

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,720
have some names for me to check out. Let me just start, read that right away because that's

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,040
interesting. Cecil B. Scott Brown is a very interesting character. He is named throughout a

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,960
lot of Stephen Greer's files and in Grant Cameron's research of Dr. Eric A. Walker,

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,480
both Cameron and Dr. C. B. Scott Brown wrote to University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Eric Walker

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,840
to talk to him. I think C. B. Scott Brown is no longer with us, but that is a very interesting

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,240
person to research and look into. But hey guys, thanks for joining today. This should be a fun

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,280
stream. I got some pretty fun stuff to talk about today. Of course, it's been a busy week in the

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,960
field of ufology and also we missed last Sunday. I was out of town, so we're going to do the 10K

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,400
stream today. And part of the stream today, I want to share a little bit of some ongoing research

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm doing. That kind of ties into the UAPDA. I think everybody watching will find that very

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,920
interesting because I sure did. And I'm really excited to see that. Let's see a couple questions.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,760
Kai, I'm sorry about the Browns. I really am, man. Maybe come over to the Bengals, bro. We got a bit

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,720
better of a squad. Chris, I did see what happened with Grant Cameron and Dick Cheney. Grant Cameron

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,920
is a fantastic researcher. I've been combing his files, the Grant Cameron files, for more stuff on

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Dick Cheney because as I talked about in my last video, Grant Cameron released his entire trove of

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,000
UFO files from his decades of research. There is so much there. I haven't even begun to kind of

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
filter through everything. As you guys know, we go through the Stephen Greer DPI archive here and

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
then we'll do the Grant Cameron files as well because there's a lot of interesting stuff there.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,240
And Mighty Mo, yes, you are on time. Are there any interesting retrievals that have happened in the

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,040
UK or nearby? Yes. There are some incidents in the 70s and 80s. A couple in England. Let me get

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,520
out the handbook real fast and find those out. We got that crash retrievals. Magic Eye is only

24
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,880
on us. There's two cases that come to mind in England. Of course, there's the rental from Forest

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,360
Landing. So, M1138T, if you're listening to me, write down these dates. Garleton, England, July 16,

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,120
1963. Let me keep going. Pencrige, England, February or March of 1964.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,560
Walt, I'm sorry, I cannot speak. Walthamstow, England, April 13, 1964.

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:12,000
Cambridge, Shire, England, January of 1965. And if you want to count North Wales, Burwin Mountains,

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,960
North Wales, 74, around the same time of the Kuyame alleged incident. So, those are a couple

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,040
examples. And if you want a more recent example, I would look in 1991, July, and Cheadle, Stafford,

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,640
Shire, England. This is about, this is close to 1992, the alleged Long Island, New York case,

32
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,640
which if you guys don't know that one, that's going to be a case we feature as it supposedly

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,840
occurred on Long Island, New York, 1992, near Brookhaven Labs. Okay. Hey, look, man, I don't say

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
bad words. I keep it clean on this channel, but you know, the Steelers are worse. The Steelers are

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:58,080
worse. What's up? Good to see you, Dr. Doc. Looking to see B. Scott Brown. I have not heard

36
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,800
of Carol Rosen or Bryce DeWitt. I have heard of Bryce DeWitt. Yes, we've talked about the

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,400
Nepal Retrieval in Kathmandu in 68 in Moondust, quite a long time ago as well. That's such an

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,320
interesting case. I was compiling some documents on Moondust for somebody the other day. And that,

39
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,240
of course, was a case I sent over. What's up? What's up, dude? Broad and North. Thank you so

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,080
much for the 200 Norwegian crown. I really appreciate that, man. You're the man. I love it. Thank you

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:36,480
so much. Something or someone. So Grant Cameron is, he has a website that's called Presidential UFO.

42
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Grant Cameron has been really instrumental kind of before the age of John Greenwald and so forth

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,080
in utilizing Freedom of Information Act requests and the National Archives to kind of find hidden

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,360
files and letters on various individuals. This includes Wilbur B. Smith. This includes Dr.

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,440
Eric K. Walker. This includes President Johnson. So Grant Cameron, of course, had early in the

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,480
2000s, 2001, called into a radio show asking Dick Cheney outright, inquiring as to his involvement

47
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,520
with UAP programs in USG. And he just said something along the lines of, if I was briefed on

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,400
that, I probably couldn't talk about it. Darth Cheney is correct. Thoughts on Jay Stratton's

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,600
upcoming book. I think it'll be interesting. There seems to be a lot of drama boiling over with Jay

50
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,920
and Lou and the whole ATIP, all SAP stuff. So we shall see how that goes. As an American, I usually

51
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,320
only see English UAP media. Do you know of any good translated resources or channels covering

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,880
any other countries, particularly Asia? I do not, actually. I do not know of any kind of

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,120
channels that cover Asian materials. I would be particularly interested to hear about

54
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,600
the history of crash retrievals in China. Of course, there's American sources of many

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,040
crash retrieval cases in Cambodia, Vietnam, and so forth in the Vietnam War or conflict. But

56
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,960
that is well worth checking out. I would also like to look into these. Could I also use metric

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,160
units in my video? Yes, I will. I'm an American, but remember, I'm schooled as an engineer. So

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,240
metric units are near and dear to my heart. I absolutely will. I always face this predicament.

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,200
I always face this predicament. What is your MMA record? I have never fought an actual

60
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,440
sanctioned mixed martial arts fight, but earlier this year, I did participate in a

61
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,920
Giju Jitsu tournament and took third place in the heavyweight division.

62
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,640
Congrats on 10K. I really appreciate that. Are you familiar with the Forgotten Languages website

63
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,440
that has been active since 2007 and posting various articles every day? I actually got a link

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,920
from Forgotten Languages. We're going to talk about it a little later today in relation to UAPDA.

65
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,760
And yes, I do want to talk about that because I also have some good friends who kind of went

66
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,720
down that rabbit hole a while ago and probably have some more interesting stuff to say than I do.

67
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,800
But yes, it's very interesting. Anything on the Senator who blocked UAPDA?

68
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,560
2.0, Rand Paul. Everything I found was that no aerospace course donated to his campaign

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,160
and that he criticized the allocation of $22 million to ATIP. So instead of Rand Paul and Mike

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,520
Turner and these guys, we're going to talk about some of the lobbyists, the companies that lobbied

71
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
against the UAPDA. And I'm really excited to talk about that because those are really interesting.

72
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,000
Larry Reed worked for Lockheed. He has a book called Quantum Wave Mechanics, a dense physics

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
textbooks that covers anti-gravity and has UFO designs. Very interesting. That is very interesting.

74
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,520
I will have to check that out as well. The Hudson Valley Wave, interesting how many of

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,880
these sightings said the bottom of the crafts had what looked like... Yes, okay. So I've been

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,720
trying to talk to Ryan Wood about kind of early sightings of UFOs and possible ARVs. And the

77
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,840
Hudson Valley Wave may be an example of early days of ARV, alien reproduction vehicles with

78
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,080
kind of a lot of exterior opponents, triangles with seeming like a piping and not so circuitry,

79
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,880
but almost kind of signs of manufacturing on the bottom. I think if anything that indicates

80
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,080
maybe towards more a human-made origin, and I would really like to talk about that more.

81
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,200
Think about the James Webb talk. I have not really been... I've not been too dialed in. I know

82
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,160
the narrative going on right now, but to be honest, I have... I got crash retrievals

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,280
and whistleblowers to talk about right now. So we'll let that play out a little bit. I'll probably

84
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,720
kind of stay on the sidelines for that, but of course I will be updated. I have no opinion at the

85
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,240
moment. What is your opinion on the Voronezh UFO incident where UFO landed and beans came out

86
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,440
of the object? A lot of witnesses and KGB investigations. Was this one of the files that

87
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,520
George Knapp smuggled out of the Soviet Union? Remind me if that was the Voronezh incident,

88
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,080
please, because that's kind of on the tip of my tongue and I can't think right at the moment.

89
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,600
David, Carol Rosen was the first female head of an aerospace company, Fairchild,

90
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
and worked with Werner von Braun. She writes about UFOs and mentioned von Braun knew about

91
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,560
an engineered alien invasion. Okay, that's interesting because I know a lot of people talk

92
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,680
they like to relate Project Bluebeam or something along those lines with kind of the final words

93
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,320
and the gravestones of Werner von Braun and of course his mentor, Herman Osberth, participated

94
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,120
in very serious flight calculation speeds of UFOs back in the 40s. So that is interesting.

95
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,520
Local H.J., thank you so much for the two bucks. You make the best UAP content. Keep it up. I really

96
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,000
appreciate that, man. I absolutely will keep it up. Hopefully, there will become a time where

97
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,040
these videos are more so a historical record versus just investigating stories. That's what

98
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm hoping for. Why Brazil has so many UAP sightings? They have no nuclear capability

99
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,280
or nuclear power plants for my knowledge. I've wondered this as well. There are a lot of

100
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,680
Brazilian fighter pilot, military pilot encounters with UFOs. And besides the Kalora's

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,440
Incident, I think this was in the 80s or 90s. There's a famous incident in Brazil. It's called

102
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Night of Something. I got to find it. I'll post it in the Discord, but it's where multiple,

103
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
multiple, multiple people across multiple states in Brazil all observed very similar

104
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,640
things flying over Brazil. So this combined with the Kalora's Incident, with the Magé

105
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,240
Brazil, combined with Virginia. Brazil seems to have some of the most activity of UAP outside of

106
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,680
the U.S. And it is very interesting. That Kecksburg video was awesome. I appreciate that. That was

107
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,160
a heck of a lot of fun to make. I want to continue along the lines of investigation for Dr. Eric

108
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,760
Walker. I reached out to his children. I've heard nothing back. And I've also reached out to Joe

109
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,960
Califano. If you remember, I talked about him kind of in Johnson's meeting. So I've heard nothing

110
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,920
from him, but that'd be a person I really would like to speak to. All right, we'll get through

111
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,640
these guys. And then there are a couple things I want to speak about. And we'll do more Q&A. But

112
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,120
I think one thing in particular, everybody will find of great interest. Excited to hear that

113
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
you're familiar. I've been down that rabbit hole and I've compiled a lot of information from that

114
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,400
site. People love to dismiss it, but there's more going on there for sure. Yes, for anybody that

115
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,360
just joined, we're talking about the Forgotten Languages site that it was the anonymous briefing

116
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
for Congress for the UAP timeline that has a lot of links to the Forgotten Languages site and

117
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,000
references there. Very interesting. As Earth Ambassador to the Aliens, I would like to offer

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
up Rand Paul to you, Aliens for Abduction. You could do whatever you want with them. Yeah, Rand

119
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:35,200
Paul, this is a bit out of left field for him to be the primary blocker of the UAPDA. I was not

120
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,280
expecting such a thing. What's up, Zach? Gordon Novel of JFK and Watergate fame wrote a book on

121
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,840
reverse engineering. Kraft just learned about that recently. That is interesting. I've never

122
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:53,440
heard of that. I've got to check that out. If I'm not mistaken, the Hudson Valley UAPs were

123
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,000
responding in movement to witness thoughts. I've not heard that either. I need to check that out

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
as well. Okay, let's keep going through these guys. We'll get through these and then a couple

125
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,800
topics I can't wait to talk about. Everything there is available thus far with the James Webb

126
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:15,200
Telescope Drama. I can't remember what Senator said. He said no comment to expose a classified

127
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,400
briefing. There's plenty of other stuff, at least for me, my focus to talk about versus

128
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
James Webb. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of good articles, maybe from Matt Laszlo,

129
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,320
maybe from other content creators talking about this. I'll probably wait off for a little bit

130
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,280
just because there's so much dang stuff I really want to talk about. Yes, this Brazil incident is

131
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:44,080
called Night of the Flying Saucers. Radar says, another Norway incident in June of 1967. I'm not

132
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,600
even going to try to pronounce that man, but this is similar to the Spitzberg in 1952 case. Norway

133
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,840
also has a lot of very interesting sightings worth checking out. How do you explain to people the

134
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,040
reasoning behind the use of the nuanced term NHI or non-human intelligence? This is because this is

135
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,080
the term put into the congressional record, non-human intelligence, not alien, not ETs,

136
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,480
not ultra terrestrials, not crypto terrestrials, but non-human intelligence. This is why in his

137
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,520
interview with Ross Colthart and his appearance in the hearings last year in July of 2023,

138
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,560
David Grush made meticulous effort to always say he's talking about non-human intelligence,

139
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,280
never using the word alien, never using the word extraterrestrial. Then if you notice people

140
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,240
like Sean Kirkpatrick in their interviews will always talk about, say, alien or extraterrestrial.

141
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,680
They will hardly, if ever, use the term non-human intelligence. That is why the term

142
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,280
non-human intelligence is so important to use in context. What exactly is this alien virus?

143
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Is this the reason they're so serious about silence? I'm not sure. Possible origins of an alien

144
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,000
virus may come from the 1974 Koyame Mexico crash retrieval in which a team of Mexican soldiers,

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,960
according to the denumber report, was killed by a biological contaminant leaking from the craft.

146
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:16,400
So I'm not sure. They do use JWST for photos of planets within our solar system. Yes,

147
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,040
they do. And they also use it for mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry, I don't know how to say that

148
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:29,760
in plural form or for exoplanets. Okay, let's see. They are tool poids from... Oh, more tool poids.

149
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,160
Cool. Well, as we talked about last week, or two weeks ago with Greer, he was talking about

150
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,160
various forms of UAP and kind of the significance of UAP and said that defense companies like

151
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,560
Lockheed Martin were creating almost thought forms. That was really, really interesting to me.

152
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,320
Kecksburg video was nice and congrats on 10k sub. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that very much.

153
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,840
Do I have any plans to visit some famous locations? I would love to, but I do have plans to go to the

154
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,240
November 13th hearings in Washington if I can. If I can swing that, I'm going to find a dang

155
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,480
camera guy, bring that guy, go to those. And then I've heard rumors of Seoul doing another conference

156
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,240
in late November of 2024. If that happens as well, I will also go to that.

157
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,600
Jimmy, I know you. I think you changed your name. Thank you so much for the $20.

158
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,320
I very much appreciate that very, very, very much. These people are always in the background

159
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,960
and John Lear in 1988 named a lot of interesting names of second generation MJ12 Bobby Ray Inman.

160
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:35,200
Yes, absolutely. Carl Sagan, Edward Teller and Hillencoder, Senator or Senior Bush, HW Bush.

161
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,720
Yes, especially Hillencoder. Hillencoder is of extreme interest to me. We talked about him at

162
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,360
length as the named briefing, briefing individual of the Eisenhower briefing document and who

163
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,960
also had some actually pretty outstanding comments on UFOs publicly. So very interesting person,

164
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,120
Hillencoder, but also Bobby Ray Inman. I can't remember where we covered him. I think I talked

165
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,720
about him in the, what was it? The Off World Technologies Division in relation to the Navy.

166
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,920
I think it was, but yes, very interesting. What do you think about the phenomenon? The more they

167
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,760
will manifest to you even in, I'm convinced the more you think about, yeah, that's like the call

168
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,280
of the void, right? The more you stare into the this, the more it stares back at you and that's

169
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,880
kind of a, the associated term with much, much kind of high strangeness.

170
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,800
Kai, the thing about the Hudson Valley and all these UFO waves like Belgium being manmade is

171
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,200
why do they fly like they are trying to be seen? It's almost like the ARVs are trying to replicate

172
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,440
NHI behavior. Yes, this is very weird to me. I have many personal friends who are adults just

173
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,320
because I trained Jiu Jitsu and I mean, I'm an adult too, but they're older 40s and 50s who

174
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,080
talk about his kids, especially in the area of New York. I have one friend I trained Jiu Jitsu with

175
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,040
who saw a triangular shaped craft with three lights flying at a very low altitude. I'm talking

176
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,360
hundreds of feet over him. It often seems like these craft, especially triangular shaped craft,

177
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,080
are flying at a very low elevation, almost begging to be seen. It's very strange.

178
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,400
Looking at Thomas Bearden, I have heard Bearden's name before. I can't remember exactly where.

179
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,280
MZ, you're from Brazil and I can say there is a lot of UFO activity here and most of it is not

180
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,680
talked about outside of Brazil. The Claudio case is real. I'd love to hear more if you have some

181
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,120
cases that are underrepresented and underrepresented and under explored, especially crash retrieval

182
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,360
cases. Jango, thank you so much for the $10. You are generous with your money and I really,

183
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,280
really, really, really, really appreciate that. The Norway incident, the Norwegian military spent

184
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,600
several weeks diving after the object without finding anything. This reminds me of the Shag

185
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,160
Harbor in 64 case. Okay, someone or something. Here is Kirk Patrick dodging the ET versus

186
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,040
NHI question to a ridiculous degree. Yes, it's absurd. Kirk Patrick is the specific example.

187
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,000
And although he's more of a Twitter troll, guys like John or Stephen Greensreet saying,

188
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,600
oh, he's flying alien space monsters. That's another one that's a bit funny to me. Oh, sorry.

189
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,440
What is your take on David Grush and Lou Elizondo constantly saying maybe they're from

190
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
in between when referencing we don't know if they're alien or extraterrestrial?

191
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,880
Well, Grush has talked about, especially in outtakes of his interview with Ross Coldheart

192
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,440
for News Nation. He says he uses the term nonhuman intelligence, but also says that these are

193
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,880
presumably extraterrestrial. But then in the congressional record also discusses the holographic

194
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,960
universe principle and the possibility of sort of ultra dimensional beings, beings that don't

195
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,440
necessarily originate from our 3d space. My question is why cannot it possibly it's both

196
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,920
the this isn't a mutually exclusive thing to have extraterrestrial and sort of an ultra

197
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,280
terrestrial even a crypto terrestrial origin. There could be a combination of these.

198
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,360
Fan meetups and Roswell, that would be fun. Actually, I would love that. I'd love to go to

199
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,560
to the Roswell region. Maybe we'll do a fan meetup as as we grow. That would be very interesting.

200
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,640
Thank you for talking about the biological aspect of it. This, my friend, you cannot talk

201
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
about crash retrievals without discussing biologics. This is something I learned from early.

202
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
Always thought I could, especially because biologics are the most controversial part of

203
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
any crash retrieval story. I thought, you know, maybe I can stay a little bit away from this,

204
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,200
but no, absolutely not. I in fact, I love speaking about biologics. What's your opinion on JRot?

205
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,920
Any plans to cover this JRot? If anybody doesn't know, this is the extraterrestrial being allegedly

206
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,760
covered from the Kingman crash in 53. According to this story, there were two JRots captured live.

207
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:29,120
One EBE, it was called a, I can't remember. It was like EBE 53 AZ or something like that to denote

208
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,240
Arizona and the year and the extraterrestrial. One was sent to Los Alamos National Labs and

209
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,080
one was sent to S4, I believe it was. I think this is a very interesting story. And there's

210
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,680
also claims of JRot outside of just Dan Burish, of course, who's made the JRot story very famous.

211
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,640
And he talks about JRot being housed in a very secure facility. And I think the fifth floor

212
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,840
underground in S4, where he would take blood samples from this creature as it would be brought

213
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,920
into sort of like a containment dome, like if you've seen boy in the bubble, like that. But

214
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,400
there's also, who am I thinking about? I'm thinking about a, why can I, Bill Youhouse,

215
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,080
who has talked about JRot and the flying saucer simulator that was installed at S4 from the

216
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,480
Kingman crash. But JRot's very interesting. Yay. Your super chat got ignored, Chris.

217
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh, I'm so sorry, man. Chris, thank you so much. I'm sorry, man. I try to answer everything. That's

218
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,520
totally my bad. Zable on need to know if you guys don't know Bryce Zable, he runs a co-podcast with

219
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,600
Ross Coltheart on YouTube called need to know. He said, Sagan knew a lot more about UFOs.

220
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,720
Lear and 88 called him out as the second generation of MJ12. He was in the hearings in 68 too.

221
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,800
Yes, absolutely. Even Ryan Wood has talked about Carl Sagan in regards to the majestic

222
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,200
documents quite a bit. I think multiple people now, Lear and Ryan Wood and maybe even Stanton

223
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,360
Friedman has commented on this, that Carl Sagan was secretly rather involved in UAP. But I'm sorry

224
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,200
for missing that, man. That's truly my bad. Truly my bad. Let's see. We talked about this a little

225
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,520
bit, TF, the James Webb telescope. There's definitely the congressman who talked about note,

226
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,160
said no comment in regards to a James Webb briefing, but I will probably wait to cover

227
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,720
that if covering it at all, just because I like to have a lot of time to sit down with my projects.

228
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,920
Now, a lot of developing stories are a little bit tough to cover.

229
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
Trollmama, thank you so much for the $20. I really appreciate that.

230
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,000
Be a BJJ and MMA beast. Hold down 10K YouTube channel. Thank you very much. I will try to

231
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,600
continue to be a beast. When they say they walk among us, do you think imagine them being undocumented

232
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,000
or fully integrated into the system and have families and kids? I don't know. That's actually a

233
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,160
good question. There's of course different conflicting schools of thought. Of course,

234
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,920
there's the valiant Thor story of the alleged extraterrestrial that I believe aided Eisenhower,

235
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:09,040
was it, who almost passed for an uncanny valley effect of person. Now, I still don't have an

236
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,920
informed opinion on if NHI is actively walking amongst humans. I have not done enough research

237
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,800
into that, but this is something I would like to look into more, but I know the story of valiant Thor.

238
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,600
There's also David Ike's theory of reptilians walking among us, which is very scary, but I do not know.

239
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:36,320
MrBeast had a UFO sighting recently. I've never seen a MrBeast video, but I heard his videos are

240
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,400
quite crazy. What do you make of the rumors of China's development of some kind of underwater

241
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,560
laser propulsion system? Could this be the technological surprise we've been warned about?

242
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,760
Possibly, because in just a few minutes, probably like 10 minutes, actually,

243
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
we're going to talk a little bit about underwater, but with the US.

244
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,040
I hope we have aliens here on earth like Rogers from American Dad. That would be hilarious.

245
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,600
If there's NHI working alongside human scientists, like some aero whistleblowers have

246
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,320
stated and so forth and many others, I would really, really, really like to see that.

247
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,680
What do you think about Gary McKinnon and Hack and his supposed secret space program?

248
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,240
If anybody doesn't know Gary McKinnon, I think this was in 2002. He hacked various military

249
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,600
systems and found files relating to non-terrestrial officers list of parent US officers that are

250
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,880
operating in ships throughout our solar system and possibly abroad called non-terrestrial officers.

251
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:44,480
He also posted an image of a craft, I believe it was, of a USS craft and it was cigar shaped,

252
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,560
but with almost portholes at the center, at the top and bottom, and some sort of variable

253
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:59,200
surface at each end of the cylinder. His story is one of the most, it's been around in Ufology

254
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,800
one of the longest Gary McKinnon story. Now, I think some of the controversy with him and

255
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,600
where people start to discredit him is he says he didn't either own a printer or didn't think to

256
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,480
grab a print of these files. However, I know Gary McKinnon is still around and I think he's

257
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,760
evaded legal prosecution at this point and I would like to speak to him. I'd like to speak to

258
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,840
him a lot, but the Gary McKinnon story is, that's kind of one of the OGs, the classics of Ufology

259
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,280
and I will probably reserve judgment until I can try and talk to him or if somebody has a

260
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,800
documentary featuring Gary McKinnon coming out, which would be interesting. Harry, thank you so

261
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,520
much for the five bucks. It doesn't matter how much you give, I just appreciate your support.

262
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,280
Thank you so much. I'm trying to get through all of these guys. I'm sorry for being slow.

263
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,920
The Alagash UFO incident is a good one to check out. I have not spent any time looking

264
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:57,200
into the Alagash UFO incident, so that is excellent. Feather hat talking about Sagan.

265
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,320
When I heard Sagan might be involved, I was like, no way. Also come on, Sagan,

266
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,600
you seem the opposite of MJ12. Yes, Sagan was also very outspoken against UAP. So was

267
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:15,360
Astronmer Donald Menzel. Oh, more Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast UFO retrieval stories always have

268
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,080
chrysalogics involved. It's Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast has talked about crash retrieval,

269
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,080
if that's the case. I don't know how that fits into his channel, but that is interesting and

270
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,400
I'd like to hear it. What is the full list of 12 alleged crashes that there's more than 12,

271
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,920
but there's a lot more than 12. I would recommend reading the book Magic Eyes Only by

272
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Ryan S. Wood, which recounts almost 100 crash retrieval cases, but there's plenty more than

273
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,680
12, especially in the US. You got classic cases like Kecksburg, Roswell, Kingman. Why can I think

274
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:59,360
of the name? There's a name I can't think of right now. Kecksburg, Long Island, a case in West

275
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Virginia, 1897, Aurora, Texas crash, the Cape Giradeau 1941 crash. There's a 2008 Needles,

276
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,480
California. You can think of two dozen cases and I'm thinking of Aztec as the 1948 cases. I

277
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,560
couldn't think of, but there's more than 10. There's dozens of cases you could read about.

278
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,360
There's the San Augustine Plains. There's just so many here in the States.

279
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,680
Let's not do the David Ike thing. Yeah, I'm probably going to stay away from talking about

280
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,480
David Ike. That's not my realm. They travel here in faster than light tech to walk among us

281
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
just to work a nine to five and pay taxes. I hope not. I hope the galactic standard isn't to work

282
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,120
in a nine to five because that would be very depressing. Walking among us might involve

283
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,280
hybrids from egg sperm extraction program involving abductions. There's been quite a bit

284
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,480
of talk about hybrids of late. Don't know what to make of it. Haven't done research. Correct me

285
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,960
if I'm wrong. I think a couple of scientists have made such mention lately, but I will be

286
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,200
doing my research. Any chance of a video on the MAJ Brazil UFO accident? Yes, absolutely. I would

287
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,400
recommend watching MacMave Studios video on MAJ Brazil. There's so much kind of video supporting

288
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,760
video of the case and some really rich stories. Yes, absolutely. I got two videos I'm going to do

289
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,960
before another crash retrieval and then we will see what crash retrieval we do then,

290
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
but I promise you will get there. What way do you speculate the phenomenon relates to?

291
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,040
Elizondo stated as the three-body problem. What aspect of that story is relevant to today? The

292
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,680
three-body problem talks about the dark forest theory of the Fermi paradox, which if you've

293
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,840
never heard of the dark forest theory, it's the concept that advanced extraterrestrial

294
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,720
and kind of universe-spanning civilizations do not broadcast their location in fear and

295
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,960
knowledge of other civilizations that will basically invade and take over and so forth.

296
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,240
I think with Lou, this could probably tie into the threat narrative he talks about often about

297
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,080
possible threat proposed by NHI. This could be in direct relation to something like the

298
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,640
three-body problem and the dark forest theory, so kind of the threat narrative.

299
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
Corona Clay, the one. Has there been any claims from the archaeological community of a potential

300
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,560
UFO found on a dig to match up with Bob Lazar's claims? Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge.

301
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,360
What do you know about the project Gary Nolan briefly talked about? Some kind of tracking system

302
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,120
in a military-type units that will try to recover the craft before Pentagon

303
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
program units get it? Okay, yeah, that's a good question. Gary Nolan was talking about basically

304
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,120
a private crash retrieval team. This isn't like a 2004 Lockheed team. This is a team to make up

305
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,480
modern day to try and beat USG or private retrieval teams to down UAP. I think that is a very

306
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,040
dangerous proposition, especially if you're not utilizing Tier 1 operators. How are you going

307
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,600
to get there before the US military and US and the program when these allegedly have things like

308
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,280
golden domes, according to Danny Sheehan, which can detect UAP while still cloaked? How are you

309
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,360
going to get there before these retrieval teams who, as we've heard stories of, will shoot on site

310
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,600
and not hesitate to kill people in that area? I do not think that's a great idea and I imagine

311
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,720
that would have an extremely low success rate. Do I have any significant updates of any of my

312
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,040
previous videos? Yes, and those will make it into future videos. Always updates. There's never a

313
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,240
video I do where I stop investigating then, so especially we're going to talk a little bit about

314
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,680
an update to one of my recent videos, the Off-World Technologies Division here briefly. Any opinions

315
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:43,040
on Michael Masters currently reading the extra-testrial model? I have never heard of this model,

316
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:50,800
but I do know Michael Masters, but I will check that out, my friend. George Nicolakis.

317
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,400
A hundred crash retrieval. Okay, now I'm sure they have the complete Star Trek pack,

318
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,480
mind-blowing. Yes, of course, many of these stories are nothing more than stories with

319
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,560
a little more than just newspaper clippings, anecdotal evidence, hearsay, second, third-hand

320
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,040
encounters, but there are quite a few retrievals and I'd say well over a dozen that have very

321
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,680
viable paper trails to pursue. A lot of these I have covered before and will continue to cover.

322
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,120
A lot of them need a lot more research done, but yes, there are numerous cases and this really

323
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,200
is excluding places like China and Russia, the former Soviet Union. So to access those files

324
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,960
and the alleged case or crash retrievals that have occurred there, that is something I want to do.

325
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:37,200
Okay, sorry, trying to get through these guys because then we'll get to the UAPDA. I'm sorry,

326
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,480
I will try to answer everything. Do you watch Angry Astronaut? Interesting UFO footage. No,

327
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,000
I need to check that out. I mentioned a couple of times, guys. It's a little tough to keep up

328
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,480
with footage just because there's so much footage and you can really debate endlessly and go down

329
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,080
rabbit holes of footage. So no, I have not, but I will make some time to do so.

330
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,160
Soon you're going to have to shut questions off and riff. Yes, we'll get through these and then

331
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,880
we will because I got like a, I think like 15 tabs up on Chrome I want to go through.

332
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,720
Ecology brings up some cases. View these, all great cases. 1989 Kalahari, that's what we're

333
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,360
going to talk about soon. That is a bit of a controversial case as well as the South Africa

334
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,560
1996 case that was mentioned by Stringfield. Good cases. Scallions, thank you so much. I really

335
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,320
appreciate your support. Thank you very much. Lou Elizondo keep constantly saying that's like

336
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,640
finding a 747 in King Tut's tomb has me wondering if he's hinting at finding something in Egypt

337
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,200
quite possibly. And I like the analogy of handing the nuclear device to people in Victorian era

338
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,360
as well in terms of the strangeness of this technology. Don't you think it's interesting

339
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,680
how figures like Elizondo and Grush have acknowledged we've made crash UAPs and are reverse

340
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,640
engineering them but won't say how much progress we've made? Yes, absolutely. And as far as I

341
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,960
know, I don't think Grush specifically is touched on the concept of ARV or successful reverse

342
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,800
engineering at all. The extent that I've heard is of course from public sources is that little

343
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,680
progress has been made in some instances, but this could be isolated to various defense contractors

344
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,360
or programs. I think it's not too far out of the question to say that this program similar to the

345
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,000
Manhattan Project is highly compartmentalized. There's probably various aspects of the program.

346
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,080
Various defense contractors are probably not sharing their data between themselves. So yes,

347
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,640
sorry, enjoying the cold brew here. Cold brew. Sorry guys, I can't speak today.

348
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,640
Speaking of Menzel, Colthart has recently interviewed physicist Beatrice Vareal,

349
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,320
Ville Vareal of the top 100 in the world who alleges Menzel destroyed some of the astronomical

350
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,200
plates at Harvard. Yes, this is true. This is called the Menzel Gap. And there's another

351
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,760
astronomer who has talked about this. This is called the Menzel Gap where much photos of

352
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,960
kind of earth skies were basically destroyed by Menzel. Menzel Gap. Very, very cool. Yes,

353
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,960
including the Washington flap that was 1952, specifically UFOs over Washington DC, which

354
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,080
led to a CIA sponsored press conference by General John A. Sanford and Roger Raimi to dispel interest

355
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,280
in UFOs. Virginia is the most famous crash retrieval case. It has details that James Fox

356
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,040
didn't cover in the film, such as the death of animals in the zoo where the NHI was cited.

357
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,280
I've heard that as well. Of course, James Fox probably couldn't get to everything, but he did

358
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,120
a tremendous job with Moment of Contact. What do I think about Patrick Jackson's theory? Gary

359
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,360
Nolan just talked about it. If anybody doesn't know Patrick Jackson, he focuses on spheres, orbs of

360
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,960
UAP. The crux of his argument is that spheres generally travel in groups of three almost in a

361
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,080
triangular shape where I don't know the full basis of a theory, but basically the three spheres work

362
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,160
in conjunction to navigate and participate in the space around it. I think Patrick Jackson

363
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,680
has a lot of images to back up his theories. I've never sat down and really dove through

364
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,600
everything, but of course, I think I've referenced some of the images and orb photos he's used before

365
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,440
because they're so dang interesting. There are claims, yes, Kabul, Afghanistan. I think this is

366
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,760
86. There's a Moondust file on this as well, but there's also stories of, I can't remember

367
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,720
where I've heard it, but of an Afghan embassy, or maybe this was an Iraqi embassy being built near

368
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,840
a UFO, or over a recovered UAP. Dead Fish Cheese Brez said, I saw a UFO 100 feet over me on January

369
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:42,800
10th, 23. I filed a MUFON report, number 127890. It was shot down over Alaska on February 9th,

370
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,440
23. Pentagon. Oh, did you witness the Alaska shootdowns or the craft that led to this? I'd love

371
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,960
to hear more about this, man. If you could give me some information on what altitude the craft

372
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,120
was flying at shape, see if any of the five UAP observables made sense to you, no visible signs

373
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:08,160
of propulsion, and so forth. I'd love to hear about it. Stories about Mercury, yeah. I think this

374
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,400
involved early stages of electrogravity, like rotating plates that contain Mercury. I think

375
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:22,080
I'm trying to use my head right now. Was anti-gravity research shut down? Was physics misled? I don't

376
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,880
think it was shut down. I'm going to be talking to Ryan Wood and Michael Schrat, if I can swing it.

377
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,120
I know you'll like this, Kai. Ryan Wood thinks the concepts behind anti-gravity were really

378
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:39,920
mastered in the 50s, and this is when ARV and reverse engineered craft were really put into

379
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,640
practice. Michael Schrat thinks the 60s was this time that anti-gravity was mastered, and reverse

380
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,080
engineering vehicles were put into practice. I'm going to have both of them on. We're going to

381
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,240
talk about these topics, and that is going to be a heck of a lot of fun, and I cannot wait.

382
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,600
Michael, you are awesome, brother. Thank you very much. Some of the radar data on the Washington

383
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:03,040
Flaps still managed to survive. Yes, it did. Christian, thank you. I'm sorry, brother. Thank

384
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,640
you very much. Any idea what this darker reality, Lou Elizondo, keeps hinting to what could possibly

385
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,240
be so bad? Well, of course, there's the threat theories of invasion or the sober reality behind

386
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,680
abduction and experimentation, if those are real. But these could be the darker reality.

387
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,560
Lou and a lot of the TTSA crew really push the threat narrative a lot more than I'd say

388
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,360
people like Grush do, and that is something I try to pay keen attention to.

389
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,480
Have I seen any of the weird MH370 videos? Yes, I think most lives, there's a couple

390
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,280
of questions about this. I'm staying clear of MH370 for now. I know that is a dang toxic sphere of

391
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,880
research, and I got plenty, plenty to look at outside of that. Regicide and non. Hey,

392
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,840
say less. I know regicide and non. I absolutely will. Keep doing what you do. Peyton Duke, thank

393
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,080
you so much for the $10. I really appreciate it. Optv, we still believe despite no UAPDA. Yes,

394
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:13,520
guys. Seriously, one minute, we'll talk about the UAPDA because I also am not crazy discouraged from

395
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,840
the shootdown of it. Christian, thank you for the $2. I really appreciate that as well. Thank you

396
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,280
so much. Kai, do you see footage of an ARV being tested over Groom Lake that was posted on the

397
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
Discord? They took a picture of the craft and it kind of looked like a flux liner. Yes.

398
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,120
There are, who posted in the Discord the TR3B folder as well? I need to look at that for some

399
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,480
other alleged ARV vehicle constructions and videos, but yes, I have seen that Groom Lake video.

400
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,160
What are your thoughts on the Reddit EBE posts? Is this the EBE that was associated with a Battelle

401
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:54,960
Lab and where the molecular biologist really goes into detail of the anatomy of EBEs? I would like

402
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,920
to talk about that, but I'm going to need a biologist on there for something. I'm well out of

403
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,520
my depth and I might be able to read the summary and say, hey, this sounds great, but I really cannot

404
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,120
offer any insights besides just saying this sounds interesting. So, dead fish, these were

405
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,720
shot down over Alaska, Yukon and Lake Huron. Not a balloon. I saw one. What was the shape of these

406
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,600
objects? I'm really interested to hear you say that. I got evidence of a clip I can send you of Jim

407
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,000
Semavan saying NASA can't tell us the truth even if they wanted to because of a SAP and executive

408
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,360
order. The clip isn't public. Unfortunately, it's Semavan. Please send that to me, uapgroom.gmail.com.

409
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:38,160
I would love to watch that. Ross Goldhart had a Swedish astronomer who's also part of the

410
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,560
Sol Foundation. She found potential evidence. Yes, I can't remember her name, but a trusted

411
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
person who runs another YouTube channel, another content creator, passed along her information

412
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,560
to me the other day. So, I'm actually going to talk to her. Edgar Fausch and Mark McCandlish.

413
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes, okay. Kai, I know you like Mark McCandlish and there will be a video on him probably in

414
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,320
the very near future. I'm covering this because I have a little bit more to add to the story now

415
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,480
of Mark. I've talked to a couple people about it, but we'll just say that the

416
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Mark McCandlish story got a little bit more interesting for myself in particular.

417
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:25,440
Menzel Gap, first UFO debunker, yes. First UFO debunker, maybe because that happened in 52

418
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,640
and right before the realm of the Robertson panel and so forth, but probably. Was physics led

419
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,480
down the false rabbit hole of string theory? I do not know. I know the debate over string

420
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,960
theory, M theory and so forth, super string theory, but I'm not a physicist and physics was

421
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,400
always my weak area. So, if I speak on string theory, I will probably sound like an idiot.

422
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,640
Adam, thank you so much. I really appreciate your kind words, brother. Thank you.

423
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,280
Yeah, okay. Dead fish. Tell us, brother. So, dead fish, if you've just joined, is talking about

424
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,000
observing in 2023 in January. The objects that were allegedly shot down over Alaska

425
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,160
and Lake Huron and so forth. I'm making a video about it, long story, but I saw it go from

426
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,040
horizon to horizon directly over me a hundred feet up. It was going about 150 miles per hour,

427
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,600
silent. It was a bright orange burning quartz crystal. Dead fish, if you make a video on this,

428
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,560
please let us let this crew know. We will, I will point the community towards your video.

429
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,400
We will support the heck out of it because that sounds fantastic and I cannot wait to

430
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,000
see your research and thesis here. So, that anti-grab is his hus, is hus hus and to keep

431
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,080
the mainstream from catching up. This is, this is, this is likely. There is also a really interesting

432
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,520
realm of research around anti-gravity spawning out of Alabama. I know Ross Colthart, as well as

433
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,480
Eric Weinstein has touched on this as well, but this sounds likely, yes. And especially in the

434
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,680
50s, there was so much work being done into anti-gravity research. Check out Jesse Michael's

435
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,520
work, his video about tea towns and brown, as well as his recent project with a Nick Cook.

436
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:00,800
They're fantastic. Dead fish, nobody, listen, nobody's doubting, doubting your credibility here. I

437
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,880
think every single person in this chat is super interested to hear about your story. Super

438
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,720
interested. Shout out to whoever mentioned Maje Brazil. Yes, absolutely. Crackerjack,

439
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,840
thank you so much for the five dollars. I really appreciate that. You finished your

440
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,840
masters in engineering. What realm? That congratulations. I don't know if I'm smart

441
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,240
enough to get a master, so that truly means you are a smart cookie. That is awesome.

442
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,280
If I had to take down an NHI brute, are we talking like a brute from Halo?

443
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
The best mixed martial art move that would work for all types. Get a Tomahawk elbow in there,

444
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,800
man. Get a Tomahawk elbow in there. I have a video and seven statements from other people.

445
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,520
Okay, so yeah, dead fish, if you're creating a documentary on this, please let me know and I

446
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,080
would love to have you on a live. Once you post this, we can talk about your video because that

447
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:55,360
sounds absolutely phenomenal. I cannot wait. You also said you saw a bright orange upside down

448
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:01,600
burning quartz crystal. Another person said it was a giant translucent craft. Now, this is very

449
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,440
interesting. What do you think about how certain UAP encounters and hotspots in particular seem to

450
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,600
be connected to other strange phenomenon like Bigfoot and Poltergeist? Jacques Filet has talked

451
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,040
about this. Yeah, like the more high strangeness of UAP, hitchhiker effect and so forth. There's

452
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,040
a podcast I love. It's a couple of Australian guys. It's called Mysterious Universe, if you guys

453
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,360
have ever talked about this, and they talk about high strangeness involved with UFOs, especially

454
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:33,200
in regards to skinwalker ranch. So I talk about this all the time, stuff like psionics is I'm

455
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,000
really trying to get comfortable with this and UAP and high strangeness is even more uncomfortable

456
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,720
for me. So I got to move really slow when it comes to like UAP, the hitchhiker effect, Lou

457
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,640
talking about green orbs and other strange stuff, some of the skinwalker ranch stuff because

458
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,440
I'm just so out of my dang element. So out of my element. See, fish, you got some you got some

459
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,600
support in here, man. You got some support. Okay, guys, let me answer this last. Hold on,

460
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,600
let's see this. Do you know Chris Mellon was highly involved in the Stargate program in 95 once it

461
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,080
got moved to the Senate? Seems like people think he just recently got I had no idea he was involved

462
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,640
in Stargate. Do you have any documents or something touching on this because I would very much like

463
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,600
to see that. History buff. If you went to med school, yeah, let's either hop in the discord

464
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,760
or shoot me an email at uapgurvegmail.com because I would love to kind of get your thoughts on that.

465
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,680
Okay, we will go through these guys. Lou has alluded to religion and spirituality many times.

466
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,680
Yes, he has. If there is a classified document on religion just to see how he reacts, I'm not

467
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,800
allowed to talk about that. If I do get to talk to Lou, which I've I've hoped I've been able to,

468
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,720
but I haven't got a chance to yet. Absolutely. Fat rodents. Thank you so much for the $10. I

469
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,120
really appreciate that. Really appreciate that. How about the JFK and UAP connection JFK MJ12?

470
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,600
I'd say it's the big ticket item. There is a I think one of the really interesting things to me

471
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,080
is that Reuben Efron, the case manager assigned to intercept Lee Harvey Oswald's mail in I think

472
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:08,800
1955 or a little bit after also had registered UAP sightings while on train with other officials

473
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,640
throughout the Soviet Union. There's just a lot of really interesting connections with JFK

474
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,400
and UAP, especially MJ12. Given the Virginia incident, I don't think I'm getting close.

475
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,920
I don't think getting close will work. Yes. If you if anybody's not familiar with the

476
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,560
Virginia incident, according to the story one, I think it was a local police officer actually

477
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,760
physically touched the the bean that came from the craft. This bean was super slick, super slimy,

478
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,400
wreaked of ammonia and actually died of a very mysterious death very soon after.

479
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,880
The mysterious universe is awesome. Yes, it is. Aaron Wright, Benjamin Grundy are two hilarious

480
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:50,320
Aussies. Okay, guys, we are let's move on to talking about the UAP DA favorite all time UAP case.

481
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:57,520
Uh, geez, I don't know if I have a favorite case. Probably my favorite crash retrieval is

482
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,840
Kecksburg. I love that story, but I also love Kingman as well. And I also there's just I don't

483
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,840
know if I have a favorite man. There's there's too many. There's too many. But okay, guys,

484
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:14,800
let me pull up. I'm going to share my screen in a second here. And we will get on to some of this

485
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,680
stuff. Let me figure out how to present, present share screen.

486
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,080
Okay, entire screen.

487
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,320
Okay, so as everybody knows, if you have been, oh, let me let me answer this from Kyle, a super chat

488
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,000
man, 20 bucks. That's incredible. Thank you so much. Have I looked into the Tianjin airport

489
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,120
sighting in China? No coverage on this very briefly, very briefly, but I would like to

490
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,040
look a little bit more about how UAP sightings over the airport kind of shut down airport

491
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,680
operations. We'll look into that more. So as we know, first posted, I'm shown a post by Matt

492
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,800
from the Good Trouble show, the UAP DA to be included in the National Defense Authorization

493
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,840
Act of 2025 was shot down. This was done by primarily Senator Rand Paul and so forth and

494
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,520
only three parts of the actual UAP DA made it into the actual, I think this was not for the

495
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,360
National Defense Authorization Act this year for 2025, but the Intelligence Defense Authorization

496
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,360
Act or something similar. Because here we can see these three aspects of the bill that actually made

497
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,960
it into the, we'll check in a second, I can't remember if it's the defense or intelligence.

498
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:38,160
But we have Comptroller General of the United States review of all domain anomaly resolution

499
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,520
office. We have sunset of requirements relating to audits of unidentified anomalous phenomena,

500
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,760
historical record reports, sunset is just kind of like the closing of and section 1003 funding

501
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,640
limitations relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. I think in this post as well as others

502
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,840
people are talking about how this might be the one positive thing to come from this, the funding

503
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,040
limitations, but we need to remember that program activities, reverse engineering,

504
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,240
crash retrieval, these are are likely kept deep hidden deep within USAPs to the point the they

505
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,840
can avoid audit purposes and audit findings and reshift reshift under SAPOC if needed. So I don't

506
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,240
think funding limitations as seen with Congressional oversight will have any effect on program

507
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:27,600
activities. So these are the three parts that made it through okay into the Intelligence

508
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,800
Authorization Act for 2025. So if you guys have heard of the site open secret, you can actually

509
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:42,160
find lobbyists and so forth for bills and for various pieces of legislation. So as we saw with

510
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,040
the three pieces of UAP materials that made it into the S.4443, I'll just call it 43 from now on,

511
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:56,560
there was one company, a defense contractor in particular that specifically filed issue reports

512
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,200
with this with Title X. Can anybody guess what that is? That is, you're probably going to be

513
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,280
right if you guess, but you can also see the tab. So that's going to, I might as well just go into it.

514
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,360
Battelle, now if you've followed my channel before, you know we've talked about Battelle,

515
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,240
we've talked about the possibilities, possible study of meta materials under Battelle dating

516
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:27,680
back to the 1940s. Here with Title X, we see that Battelle itself had issues relating to

517
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:35,440
microelectronics and device cyber protection. That microelectronics statement is extremely,

518
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,440
is a big standout to me, but also we can look for other lobbying with it filing issue reports and

519
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,240
objections to the Intelligence Authorization Act. We see BAE systems. If you've known you,

520
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,080
BAE systems, this was the contractor that if, so if you know some of the lore from the channel

521
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,760
and stuff I've covered, you will remember BAE systems from the story of a three star general who

522
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,440
allegedly showed classified reverse engineer technology to a BAE systems employee in 2003

523
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,120
or 2004. Battelle Memorial Institute, Lado Sink, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman,

524
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,400
University of California Princeton. So some universities as well, but these are some of the

525
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,360
usual suspects we'd expect to see, especially about legislation that may have effect on private

526
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:34,320
industry and UAP. Now, if anybody knows Christopher Sharp, which I'm sure many of you do of the

527
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:42,080
Liberation Times, he wrote an excellent piece on this. This came out September 20th, 2024. So

528
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:48,640
just the other day, if anybody read this article, there might be something that stands out too

529
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,960
about this, but I'm going to read it. Okay, I'll read it word for word, maybe not word for word,

530
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,600
but we'll go kind of quick. So actually, I'm not going to read it word for word, because that'll

531
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,760
take too long. But in this article, Chris Sharp talks about the UAPDA being shut down. This was

532
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,320
introduced by Senators Mike Rounds, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. I'm sure most of

533
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,880
you have heard of this legislation will know it as the Schumer Amendment, including the 2024

534
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,680
and the 2025 UAPDA for the NDAA and Intelligence Authorization Act, and so forth. I would really

535
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:27,200
recommend reading this article, but things get a little interesting here. Chris Sharp states,

536
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:34,240
we'll actually go up a little bit. So if passed, the UAPDA could have unleashed a process revealing

537
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,120
that the US government and defense contractors possess retrieved craft, which are according to

538
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,280
the act capable of transmedium travel, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic speeds, and positive

539
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,160
lift. List of the five observable or list of some of the observables of UAP craft is outlined by Lou

540
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,640
Elizondo, five now six famously, if you include cognitive effects. Liberation Times has learned

541
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,600
that the CIA currently facing mounting criticism over alleged dishonesty regarding anomalous

542
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,320
health incidents Havana syndrome, if anybody doesn't know, along with the Department of Defense

543
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,200
and Department of Energy has consistently bypassed democratic oversight and retrieving advanced

544
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,560
objects of unknown origins. According to Liberation Times, these materials are subsequently sent to

545
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:22,720
national labs and select defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin. So all stuff that's

546
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,360
really great to see in writing, right? But nothing new here. Of course, the CIA, this is in reference

547
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:35,520
to the OGA, Chris Sharp is the person that wrote the Daily Mail article about the OGA and JSOC

548
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:43,040
recovery teams. Reading on, we read a little bit more about the UAPDA, but this article came out

549
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,680
in I want to focus specifically right here guys, specifically right here. This article came out

550
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:57,280
September 20. It is now September 22. Holy crap. Two cents. That is insane. Thank you so much.

551
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:03,280
That is unbelievable. And I will eat so much to pull. Thank you so much for this. I really

552
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,760
appreciate that. Thank you. And Teddy, I'm also from Cincinnati. So thank you, man. Greetings to you.

553
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,480
But thank you again, two cents. So this article was put out September 20.

554
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,440
It's September 22. There has been a massive revision to this article,

555
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,320
a massive revision, because I've read through this today, preparing for this live. And there was a

556
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:31,360
specific mention of a specific organization that wasn't present in this article. And I was flabbergasted

557
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,000
because reading through this when it came out, you know, I saved the file just because I was

558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,160
worried something like this would happen and so forth. So but thankfully, other people have

559
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,440
talked about this on or have saved this link on the web archive from its original posting, guys.

560
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:55,280
So let's go to let's go to the original post here, guys. And let's reread. This is the original

561
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,280
article that came out on the 20th by Chris Sharp. All of this is public information. I'm not revealing

562
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,120
anything on previously unknown. Multiple programs are understood to be orchestrated by the CIA's

563
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,640
Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations,

564
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,800
including its maritime branch alongside components of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,

565
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:22,480
US Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, Space Command, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,

566
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,840
and Joint Special Operations. According to Liberation Times, missions carried out by these

567
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,600
programs include the retrieval of objects beneath the oceans, including the CIA's Directorate of

568
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,280
Operations, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office coordinated between the CIA and US Navy,

569
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:46,000
United States Special Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanic

570
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,160
Institute Oceanographic Institution. Now this seems like an insane redaction from the original

571
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,520
article, doesn't it? The original article mentioned CIA doesn't mention CIA's Directorate of Science

572
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,360
and Technology. It doesn't mention the NRO and OGA. I mean, sorry, the NRO and NGA, the two offices

573
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:09,280
David Grush worked for and was as liaison to the UAP Task Force, and it sure as heck doesn't mention

574
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,120
the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office or the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

575
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,680
If you guys have watched my lives before, remember, I shouted out one of my buddies, Max Parr, who

576
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:29,600
donated it to the channel and asked if I had done much research into the National Underwater Reconnaissance

577
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:36,560
Office. A little bit behind the scenes I had, but I was shocked to see this posted by Chris Sharp.

578
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,920
Now look at the end there, guys. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Now there is a very

579
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,840
tasty treat of research we can go down here. So one, I can't remember the gentleman who was talking

580
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,160
about forgotten languages. Forgotten languages has its own post about NRO, the National Underwater

581
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,880
Reconnaissance Office. This, for anybody who doesn't know, Forgotten languages is like a

582
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,920
really strange encrypted website that has really spoken about a lot of UAP stuff, whether it's

583
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,640
a LARP, whether it's not, but this was mentioned a lot in the UAP timeline, a collection of links

584
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,160
and so forth that was sent to Congress before the 2023 hearings. This is what that article looks like

585
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,480
if nobody's read it. It's a fantastic piece. I reference this with all of my cases,

586
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:30,320
but Forgotten languages is an anonymous site in the public domain and it's like an encrypted site,

587
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,720
but that's not what I want to talk about. The National Underwater Reconnaissance Office

588
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,560
is developed for the U.S. Air Force in CIA to manage satellite reconnaissance and it's often

589
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:47,920
known as the hidden brother of the actual NRO. But let's talk about the Woods Hole, or I'll just

590
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:55,280
call it Woods Hole from now on. So Woods Hole, its mission statement is Woods Hole is dedicated

591
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,360
to advancing knowledge of the ocean and its connection with the earth system through a sustained

592
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,440
commitment to excellence in science, engineering, and education. Pretty standard, right? Who we are,

593
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,240
what we do, vision and mission statements, they probably have some federal grants and so forth.

594
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,000
My computer keeps giving me notifications. Let me turn off my secondary speaker. Sorry,

595
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,880
guys. If you can still hear me. Yeah, okay. So I had no idea NRO even existed. Most people do not.

596
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,880
It's not very well publicized and we will probably see why after here. So if you guys remember my

597
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,800
Offworld Technologies Division video, the certain location that was spoken about much work was

598
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:42,240
done with that and it's a fellow contractor, SAIC, Science Applications Center National Corporation,

599
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,680
by analyzing contracts and grants to the contractor. So

600
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,480
WHO Woods Hole has received quite a bit in federal grants and federal awards since its inception.

601
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:04,080
Since 2001, there has been a total of $3.3 billion awarded. Many of these,

602
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,960
IDIQ indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, IDV indefinite delivery vehicles, IDC indefinite

603
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,480
delivery contract and so forth. But there are a few of massive interest here to me at least.

604
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,040
This contract in particular between Woods Hole and the Office of Naval Research for O&I.

605
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,080
This was for communications, navigation and unmanned vehicles for Arctic operations. Now,

606
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,960
if you haven't heard of O&R, I've talked about it a few times. Many ufologists and researchers have

607
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,400
talked about it a few times. I think I talked about O&R specifically in relation to a paper it wrote

608
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:47,440
on psionic research in 2008 to 2012 and the validity of psionic research. So this is just one

609
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:57,120
contract that Woods Hole has with Navy. There's also contracts, one of its largest contract vehicles,

610
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:07,120
for $794 million over the span of nine years was with the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.

611
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,280
Now, if you guys have watched the Off-World Technologies Division, I talked about a sister

612
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,680
facility, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, the sister facility here to this location in Newport,

613
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,640
Rhode Island. This project was to procure hardware, materials, and supplies as well as

614
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,840
services to develop, build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support the unmanned undersea

615
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,680
vehicle, UUV, for family of systems. So remember what Chris Sharp wrote about here,

616
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,760
that the Woods Hole, in particular, along with Nuro, is used to retrieve underwater crash

617
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,080
retrievals. And actually, just so we can see, over in the DPI archives, there's a great...

618
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,320
I'm going to put this graphic up when we talk about underwater retrievals.

619
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:56,320
It's a great graphic. Just from Greer, I have no idea in what relation this case is to. I've

620
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,800
tried to figure it out. You know how Greer's files work if you've ever been on the DPI archive,

621
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:08,000
but just a nice thing to look at here. So we can go further. So the National Undersea Warfare

622
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,400
Center, just like I said, the sister facility to the Surface Warfare Center. This is in Rhode

623
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,480
Island, not too far from the location I spoke about. But we can look at other contracts with

624
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:27,120
Woods Hole. Here is a contract with NSWC Crane. And you know what contractor it's with? SAIC.

625
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:35,120
I had zero idea this existed or that Woods Hole had contracts with SAIC. SAIC, if you've never

626
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,360
seen the video in the Off-World Technologies Division, I studied it. I went through the testimony

627
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,800
of a whistleblower in an interview that stated that Off-World Technologies was being studied here,

628
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,920
were being studied here in a division called the Off-World Technologies Division,

629
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:54,800
with a present contractor after much abundant research. Myself and my friend Kermit had determined

630
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,240
that this was SAIC, Science Applications and International Corporation. This specific project,

631
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,880
it seems like a very small amount of money. What was for research and development of

632
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,720
expeditionary weapon systems for Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA, Naval Surface Warfare Center,

633
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:17,040
Crane Weapon Systems Division, JXN, and program executive office unmanned and small combatants.

634
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,080
Now, remember what we talked about in the Off-World Technologies Division, why the specific

635
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,840
I spoke about was there to test experimental conventional weaponry, where he was taken to

636
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,160
the Off-World Technologies Division, where one piece of technology was guessed to be a weapon

637
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,840
due to an electric discharge during recovery. I find it very interesting of the mention of

638
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,800
expeditionary weapon systems here, but this goes even further, guys. There's more contracts here

639
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:49,600
with tons of contracts with NSWC Crane, with the Navy, with the Air Force, and so forth. But

640
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:54,160
let's look at this specific contract for engineering services, National Defense R&D Services,

641
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:02,480
Department of Defense Military, Experimental Development. I found this piece, the most

642
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,920
interesting or fishy here. This IDC indefinite delivery contract was awarded sole source to

643
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,720
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute because the government believes that the supplier has unique

644
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:20,160
capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained. Now, what I mentioned there, the Woods Hole is

645
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,480
the only kind of non-profit organization because Woods Hole is a non-profit, federally funded

646
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:34,240
institution that has any sort of submersible or these kind of R&D capabilities. I wanted to

647
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,880
introduce you guys to this statement by Chris Sharpe that was edited out of this article,

648
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,600
as well as Woods Hole, because I am doing a massive research project on this. It's not

649
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,920
next video, but I'm doing so much research on this and the National Underwater Reconnaissance

650
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:55,040
Office. This mention by Chris Sharpe was shocking to me of a specific mention in this specific

651
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:02,320
non-profit for undersea crash retrieval operations. And then to see that this company, this non-profit,

652
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:10,000
has ties with NSWC Crane, with the Underwater Weapon Center, and so forth, was really shocking to

653
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,400
me. So I wanted to talk about that a little bit. There's going to be a lot more research done there.

654
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,240
But if you guys found that interesting, that Chris Sharpe article in the mention of the UAPDA,

655
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:28,400
I have not seen anybody talking about that particular omission from his,

656
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,200
from his, nobody connects the dots better. People do do it better. If you guys see on

657
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,200
lives, I struggle very much to speak. I trip over my tongue because I'm trying to think of so much

658
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:45,200
stuff so fast. But so this is going to be a kind of a main line of research for myself. And if I

659
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,720
can find any similar witnesses, whistleblowers to talk about this, you guys know I will. So I hope

660
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:57,760
everybody found that interesting. Next, I wanted to talk a little bit about, and if for anybody who's

661
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,800
kind of in the discord or something, I'll post all of this stuff. I'll put an invite here if you

662
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:10,000
guys want, but I usually put all my research files in there. So just a good place to talk if you

663
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,840
want to review the research files. So next, there was a pretty interesting Reddit post yesterday

664
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,840
I kind of want to talk about now, that I'm sure a lot of you guys saw this. It actually blew up a

665
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:28,160
little more than I thought. Sorry, guys. And it says, Hello, everyone. I made my dad a promise

666
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,680
when he passed away last week. He worked for the Pentagon from the 60s to 80s. Now, if you guys

667
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:41,680
don't know, this is another long, so before I get to that, yeah, huge loss with the UAPDA, but

668
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,480
still have hope, my friend. I'm of the mind where I think that our best result is going to be with

669
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,880
a little bit more catastrophic disclosure. I do not think we're going to get much,

670
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,240
even if the UAPDA passes. Remember, there's an executive order program that was created under

671
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:01,360
Obama that automatically factors things of nonhuman intelligence. This could also be AI

672
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:09,520
to be automatically devoid of any sort of declassification. And it would take an equal

673
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,320
and opposite executive order to remove this sort of mandatory non declassification standard. So I

674
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,120
never really had high hopes for the UAPDA. Anyways, there was always going to be the struggle of

675
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,920
eminent domain. And at some point, it was probably going to get shot down again. The encouraging

676
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:33,520
thing is that, of course, the UAPDA has been killed, but we still have our hearings coming up

677
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:38,400
in November. Sorry, I was looking at talent. You've tried contacting all the main UFO channels

678
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,280
and email and chat, all of them completely ignored. What is fake, man? Let me know what's going on.

679
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,360
What is going on here, bro? I'd like to hear about this.

680
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,600
But so let's talk about this Reddit post. And we'll check in with you, Tal, and see what you're

681
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,680
saying, because I just wanted to talk about this a little bit. This isn't a long line of another

682
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,440
Reddit 4chan whistleblowers who have made some strong statements, deleted their accounts,

683
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,960
or kind of gone AWOL afterwards. The famous one is the 4chan whistleblower that came out in 2023

684
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,920
who talked about the large hamburger 3D printing facility under water and kind of the ORBs,

685
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,520
the UAP ORBs really being hammers. Just something interesting I want to talk about. This is the

686
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,480
newest and the latest of long lines. I do plan to do full breakdowns on the last person I talked

687
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,920
about who talked about the acorn shaped craft being on a sort of gyroscope inspector and so forth,

688
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,800
and the 4chan whistleblower. But this, I'm going to read through this, and then I have

689
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,560
another one of these kind of anonymous sources that relates this a little bit.

690
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,320
Okay, remarkable job, 6468. And I will be trying to contact this individual who says,

691
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,840
I'm really nervous, scared, and not sure what to write, but I'll do what I can.

692
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,960
I don't expect anybody to believe me, but I made my dad a promise. He worked in the government and

693
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:01,280
told me he was in the more secretive side. He said that he worked with NASA from the Pentagon

694
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,880
closely from the 60s to the early 80s. Closely, very, very closely. He didn't tell me much on

695
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,600
his deathbed other than what I'll put below. He died from pancreatic cancer and didn't care

696
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,640
anymore about hiding things. I wanted to post this earlier, but I was really afraid. I don't even know

697
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,960
if this will be accepted or deleted or if anyone will believe me, but I'm keeping a promise.

698
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,800
My dad told me that the mood landings are definitely real. I already know there's going to be

699
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,160
controversy there, but there's more to it. He told me the race of the moon was an invitation

700
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:37,600
by aliens who watch Earth. That's why both of the Soviets and Americans were so crazy to reach it.

701
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,680
He told me he saw pictures that the public won't get to see and remembers it like yesterday.

702
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,160
Pillars clustered together in the background in pyramid-like structures.

703
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,720
Neil was giving a wide map of Earth as a gift to a creature that was half his size.

704
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:58,560
Neil, so Neil Armstrong, was giving a wide map of Earth as a gift to a creature half his size.

705
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,640
He told me the astronauts were not told about this until the very last moment for security reasons.

706
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,440
He told me the invitation was a test of humanity's capabilities and that the first

707
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,800
country to reach them would be partners with them. I always knew my dad as I grew up was a big shot,

708
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,320
but this was just too much. He told me he didn't think they would come after me,

709
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,160
but he said a dead man switch with someone if something happens to me because of this post.

710
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,760
I don't know what else to say really. I'm so anxious I want to puke,

711
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,560
but I want to see those pictures badly. Like I said, I don't expect anybody to believe me,

712
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,280
my dad, believe my dad or me, but I kept my promise he was really hopeful the last five years

713
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,280
before he died that things would be out there, but he has been mad at the government and told

714
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,520
me he doesn't care anymore. Anyways, I hope you all have a good day. Also, why did they remove the

715
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,280
content of my post but not lock it? They didn't even give me a reason. Of course, that's super

716
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:51,200
interesting to read. I have a little problem with the operational security of this line here,

717
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,120
not telling astronauts until the last very moment about possible sightings of creatures of non-human

718
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:05,120
intelligence that doesn't seem very... Oh, actually, this was posted in Aliens. If this was cross

719
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,520
posted in UFOs, I actually asked Joey, it's not my name, who's a mod there. What the heck happened

720
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,280
if that was removed? But that seems like terrible operational security, right? Not to tell these

721
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,360
astronauts who may have severe anxiety or panic attack upon. We need a creature half their size

722
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,680
that's of non-human intelligence. Now, this person right here, according to their dad, this isn't

723
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:27,440
the first testimony of individuals who state there's video or pictures of non-human intelligence or

724
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,240
UAP either en route to two or back from the moon or on the moon itself. I know I've talked about

725
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,760
an individual in the hidden within the Greer research files. There's also astronauts who

726
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:46,640
have made outstanding comments on astronauts who have made outstanding comments on NHIs such as

727
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,160
Gordon Cooper and of course, Buzz Aldrin. I found this interesting in particular, not by itself,

728
01:08:52,160 --> 01:09:01,440
but because this reminded me back from June of another 4chan whistleblower, right? And this

729
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,480
reads a little bit to me like a lark. Of course, all of this could be... This reads a little bit

730
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:12,880
like a lark just of all the details. But this person talks about a program at 18 where he was

731
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:20,000
utilized on such as Gary McKinnon's non-terrestrial officer sent to the moon where there are pyramids

732
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,880
that when he got close to said pyramids, they kind of messed with human cognition similar to

733
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,600
other stories of getting in contact with the UAP itself. This could be drawn to stuff like the

734
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:38,640
witness I covered RA or possibly the infographics whistleblower and so forth. So I would call BS

735
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,920
just on the comment about the dead man switch requires user interaction to verify they're still

736
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,800
alive. Yeah, this post, the reason I wanted to talk about it was just because it reminded me closely

737
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:52,240
of this accountant. I like talking about these statements. I think there are some that probably

738
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,560
have more validity than others. If you guys read the one and I think it occurred in July,

739
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:02,960
it was about a person in the 24th STS, which is a special forces unit in JSOC that stated their

740
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,640
captain was kind of sent away to mysterious operations. And at one point he talked that he

741
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,360
kind of was on the case of the retrieval of a craft that really shook him to the core. So there's

742
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,920
some that are more believable than others. Generally, I find the more detail added, the more they are

743
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,800
a little hard to believe. That's why the statement about the astronauts not being told into the last

744
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,600
second and possibly the dead man switch is a little bit a little bit more as maybe a little

745
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,680
bit too much icing to the story, as well as this case right here. But this individual,

746
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:38,240
there's there's six shots. There's six shots of this. And I will post this in the discord as well.

747
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,320
If you guys want to talk about it more, because I don't want to just read through the whole thing,

748
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,280
right? There's so much. But the gist of it is this person is sent in like a non terrestrial

749
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,960
officers to the moon. I think under the moon surface, there's large caverns according to

750
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,280
this person, which are pyramid structures, as people get close to them, their cognition suffers

751
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:02,240
and so forth. I think I think this individual doesn't talk about seeing beans, but recalls

752
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:10,000
echoes and sounds in these caverns that likely were not made by by humans. So if you guys want to

753
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,200
at some point read through the whole thing, we can, but I won't do that now. Let me look through

754
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,960
some of these real fast. Check your email. I sent you a fascinating Reddit post from last year

755
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,680
that has since been removed. I saved, oh, from the molecular biologists. I think you're talking

756
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:28,240
about the EBE. Somebody was talking about that earlier. I think they stated this, this study

757
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:33,920
was done out of a Battelle laboratory near an army base, if any of you guys know specifically which

758
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:39,040
which base. That's a really interesting story. I know there's been a lot of back and forth on that

759
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:44,000
encounter. Again, I said I would talk to a biologist just because I'm, I know next and nothing

760
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:52,400
about biology. Thanks for pointing out the EO. I appreciate that, man. Good look at the data,

761
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,160
rather than just dismiss stuff because it doesn't fit your bias. There are things taken more seriously.

762
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,760
Yes, that's a, that's a great point up. Yeah, I might have a picture in my head of how I think

763
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,600
things work or what stories are true or not, but I still try and analyze almost any story I can,

764
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,720
even if things don't necessarily like scream true to me at first. I still think they're

765
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,200
worth checking out. Details of stories as well as kind of cross referencing to other cases. Let me

766
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:24,640
get a invite to the server here. Let me get an invite to the server. All you've got to do is watch

767
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,680
the press conference with the astronauts once they returned from the moon. They weren't happy. They

768
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:32,960
were in shock. I've seen that as well. I think it was, there was an individual in my discord who

769
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:39,920
was talking about this and he was saying that this clip is often used. The astronauts seem very

770
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,480
kind of distant. They seem dissociative from their current events. This could be because they

771
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,720
encountered something or just because they were so kind of shot from the mission at hand. I'm not

772
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,040
really sure. I haven't seen the, the, the video in a while, but that of course is referenced

773
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,960
quite a bit when people talked about, you know, especially the Apollo 11 crew discovering strange

774
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,120
things on the moon. And I think a bunch of people have asked me about this before. There's of course

775
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,280
Stephen Greer's whistleblower controversial. And I think I've talked about him just referenced his

776
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,600
name, Carl Wolf, who states that Wolf, sorry, that states there have been photos and images of

777
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:17,040
things on the moon. There are also multiple entries in Greer's DPI, their, his witness list in the

778
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:22,000
DPA archive. I think there's almost half a dozen of, of entries that state they saw photos of

779
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,120
structures and so forth on the moon. And then you have guys like Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11 astronaut,

780
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,440
who I, does he still, does anybody know if he still talks about the Phobos monolith? Phobos,

781
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,680
a kind of a moon of Mars where there's a supposed monolith that Buzz Aldrin had talked about quite

782
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,640
a bit. What do you think about the alien biology reddit post? We'll talk about that once I can get

783
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,480
some biology under my belt. I think with, I think I would, we'll probably talk about this specific

784
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,200
one here with the moon in discord and we'll just kind of get things running. We don't need to get

785
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,520
too involved in that here just because I don't think there's much connection to ufology at a

786
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,400
wider scale besides maybe the integration of a non terrestrial officers list if it involves Gary

787
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,600
McKinnon's case. I want to cover the four chin whistleblower that talks mainly about the under

788
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:11,040
sea self replicating facility. The person I talked about in the Kecksburg video, the 24th STS guy

789
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,040
and the might and the biologist. If I can get somebody who understands biology and can actually

790
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,440
help me out because okay, this was in Fort Detrick. Okay. Yes. Okay. Fort Detrick, Maryland. I think

791
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,640
it's an army base and I think it's by Raven Rock, which is a huge underground facility. If I'm not

792
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,360
mistaken, anybody know where I can find the 2023 Greer timeline, UAP timeline? Are you talking about

793
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:39,760
the timeline that was given to Congress? I can send a link. If anybody has a, I don't know how

794
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:46,960
to send you a link either connect with me on email or come to the discord because that should be

795
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:54,160
posted there. Sorry, I'll get through the Battels National Biodefense Lab. Yes. And we know from

796
01:14:54,160 --> 01:15:02,640
Vitell, they are direct. Oh, wrong one. Sorry. They are directly lobbying against the UAPDA. So

797
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,760
Vitell is always a customer of interest. Real quickly, I like this question. I know it's a

798
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,120
little bit outside of what we're talking about right now. What two piece of advice would you give

799
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:16,320
to a new BJJ student BJJ? If you guys don't know is Brazilian jiu-jitsu. This is my jam when I'm

800
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:21,200
not doing research or doing any sort of Tom Flurry. I'm trading jiu-jitsu. If you are a brand new

801
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:27,280
white belt starting off, I would really focus on conserving energy, knowing when to apply pressure

802
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:33,600
versus knowing when to back off. It is a, I can't tell you how many new guys will, you'll get them

803
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,760
in a good position side control, take their back, even something like get them in your close guard

804
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,160
and they will score them and you can feel them shaking their muscles are contracting so bad,

805
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:47,200
you will gas out incredibly quickly. So just focus on relaxing and applying strength and

806
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:52,240
technique only when needed. A lot of jiu-jitsu is about conserving energy, not applying it.

807
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,440
Number two, start to find, start to start working on your guard game early. You got to have a good

808
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,760
guard. If you want to smash, you got to be able to prevent the pass. That is what I would say.

809
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:10,240
Oh, sorry, I'll get to that in a second. Talon, what are you guys are talking about? I think in

810
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,440
the comments about Las Vegas. If some, if you guys are talking about that, fill me in.

811
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:19,360
King of NHI and BJG, no man, I'm just a purple belt in jiu-jitsu. One day, one day we'll get the

812
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:26,880
black belt, one day. Is it challenging? No, I'm in charge of neither guys. I am not in possession

813
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:33,920
of classified information on an HI. I just do research. I would very much like to be able to

814
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:40,880
have more information and I get smashed by black belts all the time. That Battelle Lab Post talks

815
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:46,000
about the alien religion again. Is that a sigh up or can they not disclose because of Cosmic Core

816
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,040
that we can't comprehend? This is the, the Battelle Lab Post is the biologist post, the Reddit

817
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,560
whistleblower. I think, am I right in saying that in that post, I'm just trying to reference off the

818
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,000
top of my head. This supposed individual references NHI religion in terms of kind of like a karmic

819
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,320
outlook where these beings kind of focus on their output of intentions into the universe

820
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:15,360
and so forth and kind of what comes back. I'm trying to remember off the top of my head. I haven't

821
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:22,960
read that in a good bit. Do you think of the recent Diddy allegations and indictments being

822
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:28,320
released at the same time when this topic of, I don't, probably not with, I don't think the subject

823
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:33,200
of, I think the stigma, I don't think Diddy and all this has anything to do with UAP. I think the

824
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,920
stigma does a dang fine job in not having people care about this. I'd still recommend trying to

825
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:45,040
talk to the average person in your life about UAP and NHI. I guarantee most of people would, will

826
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:51,040
laugh at you and say, nope, probably reference little green men. And then that's when you start

827
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:57,200
discussing facts and then they will back up. Connor, no, I had an open mind on UAP since I,

828
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,880
since the day I could read. This has always been kind of my top subject. When I was growing up,

829
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,680
part of the reason I went into engineering was I always had some little bit of fever dream

830
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,520
in my head that I could work on reverse engineering technology just because I was so

831
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:20,000
fascinated in particularly Bob Lazar growing up. So yep. So I'll put this down and then we'll talk

832
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,560
a little bit more about, we'll just do another little bit more questions right now. If you guys

833
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:30,240
want to talk about stuff, do some more Q&A for the 10K stuff. The stuff I talked about with the

834
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:37,840
neuro and sorry, and the kind of Woods Hole and so forth. This is a line of research I'm working

835
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,280
on right now. This is pretty new to me. Of course, the article came out two days ago and

836
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,960
Chris Shark does fantastic work. I can see why this portion of the article was removed. Remember,

837
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,040
guys, I'm not putting out any classified names or locations or anything. This was all public.

838
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,800
This is all public information I'm talking about, but I think there's a lot of really

839
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:03,040
interesting research avenues there. We focused on NSWC. Now we can focus on NUWC. We can focus on

840
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,600
all sorts of these underwater crash retrievals, which I think is a huge overlooked aspect of

841
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:15,120
crash retrieval. You can talk about 1964 Shag Harbor. I scour the career archives every single

842
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:26,560
day. If I can find out in what way this article, sorry, if I can find out what that piece of the

843
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,000
undersea triangle is referencing, if that's a case, if that's a whistleblower who has spoken to

844
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,760
Greer, I will try to do that as quick as possible because I'm fascinated.

845
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,920
Ortle Chow, thank you so much for the 10 bucks. I really appreciate it. I will continue to keep

846
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,680
doing this. This is my passion. Talking with you guys, as I know it's so many of yours. That's why

847
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:51,040
I'm very honored and just thankful to have everybody here. There's so many people in this,

848
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,720
the chat all the time and in the Discord. I want to shout out to Kai and Rectified in particular

849
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:03,760
for always having receipts, documents, and so forth to talk about. Kai, if you're still in here,

850
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:11,280
we will talk about Mark McCandlish as well very soon because if you're still here and want to know,

851
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:16,400
I will talk to you about the new developments in the case, but there's some really interesting

852
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:22,000
stuff. Talon, yes. My name's just Gerb in there. You can find me anywhere and anywhere as Gerb.

853
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,240
Sorry. Okay, some theme or someone. I used to dismiss Herrera due to the helicopter debunk.

854
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,480
I softened up to him once. Joey explained why the insider actually did take him to the facility.

855
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:41,200
Yeah, the helicopter photo is still probably one of the most contentious pieces around Michael.

856
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:47,360
Many people, including myself, believe that this was actually an individual named Ethan Dorian.

857
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,400
Now, Ethan is not available for comment. Joey has tried to reach out to this individual as well

858
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,240
and talk to him. I believe it was Ethan. He had an accident. I think it gave him brain damage.

859
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:01,440
It was just a random accident. I think it was with livestock or something,

860
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,480
but this is what myself and others believe. Of course, the issue with the camo match.

861
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,560
There are aspects of the camo that match up, but there are other aspects of the camo that

862
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,240
don't seemingly match up perfect. That's one of the biggest arguments against Michael.

863
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:20,400
Of course, just with the amount of content I've made on Michael, I think you guys know

864
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:26,320
I'm much more interested in this case and I do plan on probably having Michael on again in the

865
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:32,000
future. I think he even mentioned once he might be, because Michael and I both live in Colorado.

866
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,920
Maybe we'll link up to a live stream. I think that'd be a lot of fun to answer questions live

867
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:43,600
with him. I'd love to do that, but The Insider was another fantastical and hard to believe detail.

868
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:49,280
Yes, I completely understand as well when people talk about just the difficulty in believing about

869
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,520
The Insider, especially with the book like Sentinels of Ether and so forth. A lot of people like to

870
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,040
brush that off. This trick on Dobser that's so unlikely when there's books like Secret Machines,

871
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,440
there's in Jesse Michael's new video with Nick Cook. Names are escaping me right now,

872
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,560
but there was another kind of rocket scientist and anti-gravity researcher that wrote another

873
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:17,120
fiction on flying saucers. Actually, Kai, if you're in here in ARVs in the 60s, it's super

874
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:23,600
interesting as well. There is a lot more to that Michael's Insider story that I hope one day this

875
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,400
individual comes forward. That's what I hope and pray almost every single day. I would love that

876
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:36,320
more than anything because his testimony could be extremely powerful. In Nova Scotian, and now

877
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,800
thanks for everything you do. Love and peace. Thank you, man. Yeah, the Shag Harbor story.

878
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,840
That's a fantastic, fantastic case. I've heard from Justin Bush and Abduk T and former Marine

879
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,520
Corps that digital camouflage uniforms have actually matching patterns and some of his did.

880
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,040
Justin Bush is interesting. I'm part of a group that he just joined. I'd like to

881
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,040
I'd like to talk to him a little bit because he is a really interesting abduction case and I know

882
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:06,160
you guys know I've never really dipped my toes into abduction and so forth. This could be a

883
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,920
good opportunity to talk firsthand with somebody. What do you make of the large underwater structure

884
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:18,320
near Catalina Island coastal area disappearing off Google Maps relatively recently? Yes, I think

885
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:23,360
that's been posted by Timothy Gallaudet, too, of like a almost censored Google Maps piece.

886
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:30,400
So I believe I've actually talked to Ryan Wood about this. He has kind of theorized that there

887
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,280
might be two possible locations of interest of maybe underwater bases, maybe just hot spots of

888
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:40,880
USO activity, one off Catalina Island, one off of Florida. I also know institutions like UAPX have

889
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,760
been historically looking at Catalina Island in particular. So I think of any places to look,

890
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:51,120
that's probably a really, really, really good place to look. If you'd like to

891
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,680
vindicate Mike in that regard, yeah, so the camouflage you're referencing, yes, that is still

892
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:05,440
an ongoing thing to talk about, absolutely. And we got Max Parr in here. Max Parr just

893
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,520
shouted you out. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work, Herb. Sending support as always. Do

894
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,880
you think we'll get any documents from Nuro in the upcoming UAPDA release in October? I would,

895
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:22,560
I don't know. We might need to do some FOIA requests, especially Nuro projects or grants or

896
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,760
awards with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute now. That might be the new line of research to

897
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,600
pursue. Kermit may have told you about this, but I've been talking to him a little bit about the

898
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,840
research today on kind of Nuro and Chris Sharpe's article. So he might have brought that up with

899
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:47,360
you, but it's super, super, super interesting. Have you seen the Skinny Bob videos? I don't know.

900
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:54,000
There's been so much, so much debate like about Skinny Bob. I don't really have an opinion here

901
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,120
just because I don't really see an avenue to get to the bottom of this case. I think it's the same

902
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:04,320
with John Stewart's Alien Interview. There's just a kind of endless discussion about it.

903
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,520
I'll steer clear, there's plenty of research projects that I'm really passionate on that I

904
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,760
think I can really kind of advance the conversation around. I'll stick to those.

905
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,320
If there's a topic that I don't really think I can provide value on, I'll probably steer clear from.

906
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,920
This was kind of my take with Kecksburg just because there had been so much done on it,

907
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:25,200
but I really wanted to approach a few new angles kind of with Eric A. Walker with Johnson and so

908
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:30,720
forth. But if I don't think I can add, I'll probably just wait, just wait. The guy to do a

909
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:35,440
deep dive into Amy Eskridge that I would, I'll probably put her in a video alongside the likes

910
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:42,240
of guys like James E. McDonald. Amy Eskridge was interested in anti-gravity research who was,

911
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:48,240
I don't know if I can say the word on YouTube, but did pour things to herself. I think you get

912
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:54,320
demonetized on YouTube for saying such things. But yes, Amy Eskridge is a really, really,

913
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:59,120
really interesting case that deserves further research. I know a place in Outer Banks, North

914
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,040
Carolina, what play? Oh, like a underwater hotspot. I would love to hear more.

915
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,960
People used to dump huge amounts of toxic waste in the oceans out here by Cattle in the Island.

916
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:16,240
I did not know that. Foya, the videos from the fighter objects, fighter jets that shot down

917
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:22,080
the objects. Who knows if that Foya will even work it. I'm also trying to learn how to adeptly

918
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:28,880
use Foya. Otherwise, I might just ask and wait 36 months just to get nothing like I know many

919
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,200
people do. John Greenwald also gets frustrated with Foya requests and kind of gets played all

920
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:39,440
the time. Will we get videos? I don't know. Absolutely don't know. The skinny Bob videos

921
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:45,920
look like CGI. The movement looks like bad CGI. And then Starlinger is talking about the,

922
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:53,760
the skinny Bob videos are more interesting at 1.25 speed. I haven't watched skinny Bob for a

923
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,760
long time, so I really have no kind of valuable input right here. Max Barr, if you are a Foya

924
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,200
person, Neuro is a high value target for underwater UAP reports. Similar to NRO, National Reconnaissance

925
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,440
Office with fast walkers. It's the sister office focused on the ocean. Yeah, if you guys,

926
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:13,600
I've talked about fast walkers before, if you guys don't know about this, these are objects,

927
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,120
fast walkers and slow walkers entering or leaving earth's atmosphere. We talked quite a bit about

928
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:24,320
that in relation to Bob Fish and so forth and DSP, the defense support program. And

929
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:30,400
yes, Neuro, this is something I want everybody in here to keep research, research on. And Max,

930
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:35,280
you're getting a shout out by Hicology. Amy Eskridge, yeah, not so sure if she did that to

931
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,720
herself. Another person of interest that I will include there is Mark McCandlish. If you guys

932
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:46,400
don't know, Mark McCandlish was found dead in 2021, historically from a self-inflicted wound.

933
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:55,280
However, recent interviews dating back to like 2014, 2017 and so forth, Mark McCandlish spoke. He

934
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:01,120
slept with a pistol under his pillow in fear of his life. In 2014 as well, there was a documentary

935
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:05,200
made on Mark McCandlish called, I think it was called, Fluxliner and Zero Point Energy.

936
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:10,160
This was made by a filmmaker named James Allen. Before the completion of the film, James Allen

937
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:15,120
was diagnosed and dead with an extremely aggressive form of cancer within the span of a couple of

938
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,760
weeks. In his autopsy, he was also found to have suffered from heavy metal poisoning. So

939
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,960
a lot of weird deaths around that McCandlish story as well. So there has been a chemical

940
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,120
dump near Catalina Island in the 40s when the nation's largest manufacturer of DDT began

941
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,640
dumping waste into the water. I don't like to hear that.

942
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,600
So talking about Skinny Bob, the movement looks more realistic and fluid at 1.25 speed,

943
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,640
which appears matches the speed of the film they were shot on. Okay, yeah, I don't know about the

944
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:50,640
kind of original film. If what kind of film was Skinny Bob shot on, I know that probably plays

945
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:58,400
a huge role into analysis of the film. I just do not, not too, too familiar. Have you heard of

946
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:03,040
the Chains of the Sea story by that Lou references about alien arrival, yet they're here to talk to

947
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,960
other non human intelligence that exists on a deeper dimensional layer of reality on earth.

948
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,880
I know that piece, it's a, it's a book that Lou references, but I have not read it.

949
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,200
Chains of the Sea, I have it in a reading list, but no, I haven't, and I didn't even know what

950
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:21,680
it was about. So that is very interesting. So Frank Milburn, I have heard of Frank Milburn,

951
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,080
close friend of Amy Eskridge, that she was terrified before her ultimate demise,

952
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:32,320
which we'll talk about guys, because that is something or someone has a great point here,

953
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:39,840
bringing that up. Bart, any comment on Google and YouTube censoring regarding this topic?

954
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,480
I know there's, there's Ross and Timothy Gallaudet have talked about Google Maps in particular,

955
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:54,000
particularly censoring places like Catalina Island. I may be censoring, maybe just shadow

956
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,480
banning and so forth or shadow hiding results. But also, you have to remember that the vast

957
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,160
majority of the world populace and US populace still think that UAP is just a common conspiracy

958
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:10,160
theory and there's not much to it. And the story of little green men is for crazy people to make up,

959
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:16,160
which really infuriates me. Zach Brad Swanson from the Flexliner story should still be around.

960
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:26,560
Yeah. Yes, not all I'm going to say there, if you're listening is yes. Yes. Catalina is also

961
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,240
a point of operation for legit Coast Guard ops. I wouldn't think the blocking of Google images

962
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,480
is more mundane, but I could be wrong. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I do think it's interesting

963
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,560
that of all people, Timothy Gallaudet, if I'm remembering correctly, if I'm wrong, correct

964
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:44,960
me, because I don't want to misquote, talked about this specifically. Max Parr, have I looked into

965
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:50,000
the JDC two and the possibility of an accelerating UAP transparency, especially with the involvement

966
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,080
of Carl Nell, someone going on the record soon, I have not heard of JDC two. Let me let. No, I

967
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,880
have actually never heard of JDC two. If Carl Nell is talking and possibly somebody else going on

968
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,320
records, the joint all domain command and control Department of Defense program that aims to connect

969
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:11,200
military sensor and communications assets into a single network, the possibility of Nell speaking

970
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:17,440
and somebody else, possibly a first hand person going on record, that isn't I would love to hear

971
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:24,000
more about that. If you believe in angels and demons, you believe in aliens. So they kind of

972
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,360
in reference to like the Collins elite that Lou Elizondo talks about some powerful DoD figures that

973
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:37,920
revere UAP as demons and are somewhat terrified to look into the topic just due to religious reasons.

974
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:43,440
What information is she hand talking about that's supposed to be coming on October 18th? I have not

975
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:50,400
the faintest idea. I have not heard she hand talking about anything like that. I know he had an event

976
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:55,040
last night somewhere in Santa Cruz, I think it was. I think it was just to talk, but I have not heard

977
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:04,480
of it of him talking about specifically October 18th. Zach, we'll talk Brad Swaranson. I'm glad you

978
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:13,200
bring that up because I kind of want to save that for a piece on the candle. I have to have

979
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:20,080
some element of surprise. Terrible with withholding surprises, but that should be a fun piece of the

980
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:26,240
video. Has anyone figured out what the symbol on the bottom of Lou Elizondo's cup was? He blatantly

981
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:31,360
took a fake sip of the cup just before raising it to show the bottom. I've seen a lot of this

982
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:42,560
talk about Lou's cup. Now, I've seen the video. Is it for sure a fake sip from his cup?

983
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,880
Because I'm not sure what the symbol is. I know there's been a lot of analysis on this, but

984
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,120
to me at least I couldn't see anything recognizable in that clip.

985
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:57,760
So, Bart, you're saying the censoring is so bad. Searching your own YouTube watch histories hides

986
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,760
the video. That's interesting. There has been, I think, a couple of people who have said they've

987
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:08,240
been unsubscribed from the channel. Whether that's nefarious, I don't know. I won't make any accusations

988
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:18,560
maybe, but I don't know. Hiding from your watch history, that is weird. So, October 18th, that

989
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,880
UAP records are due to the National Archives. According to some folks, the file size is 1.3

990
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,400
terabytes. Yeah, Lester Nair has spoken about this. Some of these files are actually available.

991
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:31,600
What, if there's any impactful files, we shall see. I know in the available files right now,

992
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:38,880
a lot of them are files from Greer and so forth. So, I don't think there's a ton to go off on

993
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,760
those. I don't have too high of hopes for National Archives files, but I'd love to be proved wrong.

994
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,400
You know, the video is based when there's a Wikipedia disclaimer above the description.

995
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:56,480
The thing is, I'm not even sure why Kecksburg, why there would even be, in the latest video,

996
01:33:56,480 --> 01:34:03,040
a disclaimer. I mean, the Kecksburg Wikipedia page just talks about the story and doesn't offer any

997
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:09,920
of the conventional explanations. It even talks about the Cosmos 96 story being kind of refuted.

998
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:16,960
And, you know, of course, there's stuff like that on other videos, but that in particular,

999
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,520
why do I keep looking to my left? I got another monitor over here and I'm just looking at it to

1000
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,360
just ensure other stuff is going on good. I'm sorry, I'm not a crack and I promise, but I got

1001
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:30,000
another screen up there. So, I'm just, if I'm looking off to the side, it's just because there's

1002
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,280
another screen. It's nothing else interesting. Regarding Lou's interview, I've seen the full

1003
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:39,280
video and it's not as suspicious when you watch the full thing. He audibly sips multiple times,

1004
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:45,440
at least on the bottom of the mug. You know, a lot of the time price tags come on the bottom of the

1005
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:51,840
mug. I do see a world in which this was like a tag that just kind of got a bit mangled and wet and

1006
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,800
disheveled, but I have not kind of clued in on if this was a secret message or not.

1007
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:03,120
Have I had a chance to see the hundreds of pages of Canadian documents on the UAP shoot downs in

1008
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:08,240
Feb of 2023? No, but I have that on a list of stuff to look through. Deadfish in the comments

1009
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:12,880
earlier was talking about possibly witnessing this event in person and he's making a video on it

1010
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,640
where he's interviewed witnesses and so forth, including himself. So, I would really, really,

1011
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,240
really like to see that when it's done.

1012
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,320
Probably dead end, but have you looked into the alleged recordings of landings on military base,

1013
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:32,720
the Holloman landings? Yes, I have. And I will talk about that. Specifically, Gordon Cooper, this

1014
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:38,400
occurred in 1954. Gordon Cooper said he saw this film and it was recorded by his team,

1015
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,800
his team of surveyors on the site at Holloman Air Force Base, where a craft, I think it was

1016
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,040
a bit of a classic saucer design and I think, I can't remember if he discussed like landing gear

1017
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:54,240
and landing mechanisms here, but touchdown and departed. And there's also the famous story of

1018
01:35:54,240 --> 01:36:00,080
Eisenhower and I think this was also in 1954 meeting and creating agreements with NHI too.

1019
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,520
That's of course a very famous story.

1020
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:08,640
The symbol on the bottom of Lou's cup is described as tape, but I'm sure that NSA could have a

1021
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:12,640
listening device as thin as that to plan on somebody if they're tracking. It would be funny if Lou

1022
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:19,200
found it. Absolutely. I mean, I'm sure he's probably being tracked in multiple ways. Absolutely.

1023
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:24,320
Wikipedia is totally compromised by guerrilla skeptics. Yes. What a, if anybody could remind me,

1024
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:31,120
what was the story of Mick West? I think he was either changing Wikipedia entries or his own

1025
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:36,640
Wikipedia bio was changed. If anybody could fill me on what that story was, I'd love to remember.

1026
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:41,200
There, of course, I've even talked about improved various edits of stuff being deleted,

1027
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:46,960
like in the Koyama case where there's no reason for deletion and also no sighting of sources by

1028
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:54,080
Wikipedia people. And it's very frustrating. Is there any reason to think that forgotten

1029
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:58,240
languages is not a LARP? It kind of seems like it may have been made by a crazy person

1030
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,440
posting nonstop for 15 years on encrypted format in an ARG of LARP.

1031
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:08,560
Any reason to, like any evidence I have off the top of my head or on hand to say it's not a LARP?

1032
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,840
No. But that requires a full investigation. Of course, it is very strange. And of course,

1033
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:18,480
at first glance and kind of looking through the encryption and so forth, it seems like a crazy

1034
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:23,520
mofo kind of worked on this page with the amount of encryption, the amount of strangeness and so forth.

1035
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,160
Radilio, that's a cute dog, by the way. What are your thoughts on Bob Lazar? So we talk about this,

1036
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:35,600
I'd say almost every video, I personally do not comment on Bob Lazar because I cannot separate

1037
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,960
my own biases away from the facts of the case. There are arguments for and against Bob Lazar.

1038
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,360
I want more than anything for his case to be true because it had quite an impact on my childhood.

1039
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:50,400
You can see the sports model behind me that Bob Lazar created. So I tend to stay away from Bob.

1040
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:54,240
I have positive things to say about him, my negative things to say about him. I hope more

1041
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:58,960
than anything that his case is true. But it did leave a bad taste in my mouth after the

1042
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,600
2023 hearings when he said, I told you so without testifying. I didn't really like that.

1043
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,000
You familiar with the whole theory that these crash and landed UAP, we recover our gift to

1044
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,320
push our technological and cultural evolution in a particular direction? Absolutely, donation

1045
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:19,600
theory. This was talked about by Grush in the Ross Goldhart interview that many of these craft

1046
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,480
have been just kind of found left unattended in his own words. And this was also the crux of the

1047
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,720
story of third hand arrow whistleblower Eric Tabor who stated that his, I think it was great

1048
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:34,640
grandfather, great, great uncle at area 51 encountered and heard the story of an egg shaped

1049
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,920
craft that was found in the Nevada desert, just completely unattended and left alone. So yes, I

1050
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:48,160
the argument versus craft versus donation craft is one that I kind of often try and keep in mind

1051
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:54,560
during every crash retrieval video I make. I really want to hear more stories where some of these

1052
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:00,800
craft have supposedly been found just left unattended. Because I mean, if Grush specifically

1053
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,360
talked about this, he made a specific point to access that some of these craft are almost appeared

1054
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:11,440
to be gifted, that I think there's a lot of things worth checking out here. Good trouble

1055
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,800
did. Yeah, good trouble is great. Matt from the Good Trouble show. Yes. Are you talking about

1056
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:21,680
Wikipedia? Please. Any stories, cases that you initially dismissed as BS but came around to

1057
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:26,960
later post 2017. I'm a lot more open minded about this kind of thing. That's a good question.

1058
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:37,920
Geez, I'd say before probably the 1992 Long Island case, I initially just dismissed it as

1059
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:43,200
hearsay, but I think there's a lot of investigation that has been done that's worth discussing a lot

1060
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:49,600
more investigation that needs to be talked about that case. 1992 Long Island. Spent a lot of time

1061
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:56,880
researching the forgotten language. Oh, Matt Ford. Okay, so Matt Ford did an episode on this.

1062
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,040
So, Huckology. Yes, you did spend time on the Forgotten Languages website and the guy turned

1063
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:06,080
out to be a convicted fraudster. I can dig through the docs, links when I get home five minutes. Yes,

1064
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,440
please, that would be super helpful. Okay, that'd be great to talk about.

1065
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,680
It's strange that David Grush has mentioned of having firsthand knowledge edited out of his

1066
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:21,440
News Nation interview with Elizabeth Vargas. Yes, it was. Because a lot of people have stated that

1067
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:26,240
Grush has not had firsthand knowledge, which he has stated multiple times he has. And this

1068
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:31,760
piece was edited out, as well as there was a small piece that was edited out of the July

1069
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,240
congressional hearings, right, the official video. I can't remember what exactly that was, but yes.

1070
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:40,880
There would be no Half-Life game without Bob Lazar, hey. Half-Life is a fantastic game and

1071
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:46,400
hopefully Half-Life 3 is being worked on. Looked into the Reynolds from Forest incident,

1072
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,160
forgot the U.S. company involved, but Professor Simon Hollins has been digging into that interesting

1073
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:55,760
stuff. Yes, I have looked at a lot of the witness testimony around Reynolds from Forest. And I would

1074
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,360
like to make a video on it when I feel like I have something new to contribute to the case,

1075
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:05,280
because it has been talked about so much. I don't like doing cases if I'm just

1076
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:10,720
rehashing stuff, everything other people have talked about. Sorry, I'm just going to get some

1077
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:15,440
water. I'm going to move away from the mic. But absolutely.

1078
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,680
Rogan mentioned how many times Lazar explained something to him in a private chat and explained

1079
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:25,840
a few things. I can only assume he doesn't want to admit to any crimes. Yes, throughout the,

1080
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:31,440
I think it was 2017, Jeremy Corbell and Bob Lazar video on JRE. Numerous times there was

1081
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:36,640
reference to discussions being had about various topics that occurred at dinner the night before.

1082
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:42,960
I'd like to see Joe talk about this a little more, especially because I have,

1083
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,120
do have problems with how Joe treats guests like Bob Lazar and Travis Walton versus Lou Elizondo

1084
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:53,680
and David Grush. Give Elon Musk one year with one of those. One of what? A retrieved craft?

1085
01:41:54,400 --> 01:42:00,640
I'd like to see it. Max, guys, any comment from Max is well worth reading. This is for any

1086
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:05,760
anthropologist out there. If anyone is an expert with or know someone who studies Berber history

1087
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,400
slash symbology, please reach out to me. Some weird similarities to she hand symbols. Okay,

1088
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:15,360
that is, that's interesting. Guys, if anybody is an anthropologist, either talk to Max or talk to

1089
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,720
me and I'll get you hooked up with Max because Max is one of the best researchers I know.

1090
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,880
They say that anyone can say an element number and they'll be right just like 115, which is now

1091
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:31,120
known as a night now. I think 115 is a Mozgovium, right? 115 is Mozgovium. It was synthesized in

1092
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:38,320
2004 as an unstable element in Russia. But yeah, you're right. Anybody can just claim a random

1093
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:43,440
atomic number that hasn't been synthesized or proven to exist beyond theory yet.

1094
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:48,720
Seems like it could be a mix of donation landings and crashes and also maybe some shootdowns using

1095
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:54,400
exotic weaponry like Herrera talked about with his insider. Yes, Greer and others have talked about

1096
01:42:54,400 --> 01:43:00,880
the shootdowns as well, including some people I've talked about on the channel. Yeah, one solution

1097
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,040
isn't mutually exclusive, just like there could be multiple factions of NHI, multiple origins of

1098
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:10,080
NHI on the planet. There could be multiple modus operandi for NHI. Possibly some of these are,

1099
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:15,760
their craft are forced landing such as the Kingman crash. Possibly some of these are being shot down.

1100
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:20,880
Possibly some of these are donated, maybe a particular species and that command some of

1101
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,880
these egg shaped craft. These almost seemed like a formed in a piece of liquid metal shaped craft

1102
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:34,960
like to just donate these craft. I predict element 119, we'll say it powers something when it's

1103
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:40,960
synthesized. The gift theory permits the Prometheus myth and the serpent in the garden. Pretty spooky

1104
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:45,440
if there's something to it. Yeah, Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.

1105
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:51,040
It is, it is a, it is a kind of disturbing and sobering theory, but also very inspiring to know

1106
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:57,360
that there could possibly be some sort of species that is trying to encourage this species on this

1107
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:05,280
planet to try to pursue a certain lineage of technological evolution. The gifts donations

1108
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:10,080
are a test we are not passing. I think even without the donations, we would pretty much fail to pass

1109
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:15,280
any test with the way in which humans kind of treat each other and treat this planet.

1110
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,840
Congrats on the 10k. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Thank you.

1111
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:26,800
Shardul, Intel background throws up Rogan's red flags. I think, I think we talked about it last

1112
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:32,240
time, but it's really comical to me how Mike Baker, the former CIA agent shows up. I think he has 14

1113
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:39,280
appearances on JRE almost after every single UFO guest. Joe, maybe I don't, I don't know if Joe is

1114
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:46,400
necessarily nefarious. I just think that Joe's Joe. What are your thoughts on Dan Burrish?

1115
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,600
Night Shift made a good video, quite detailed, compelling story personally, but what are your

1116
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:55,040
thoughts? So I've listened to Dan Burrish's, I've listened to his like two hour interview,

1117
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:00,640
I think two or three times through. I've also read the Project Quarious document,

1118
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:06,960
the really long piece that details the 3D makeup of S4. I think those drawings were done by Michael

1119
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:16,160
Schrat. And it's, Burrish's story is, it almost, almost in a way, and this isn't discussing his

1120
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:22,400
credibility or anything seems too perfect. It's just so detailed, incredibly. I know Burrish is

1121
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:28,720
still out there. I know he's difficult to track down. I would love to speak to him. I find some

1122
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:32,640
of the most interesting stuff he talks about, not necessarily J-Rod, but the craft and levels

1123
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:36,240
at S4. That is probably what I'd want to pursue because at least according to the drawings from

1124
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,400
Michael Schrat, the location while Burrish was there and described, there was the Roswell

1125
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:45,600
recovered craft, there was an ARV that at least according to Michael Schrat's modeling or whoever

1126
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,240
created the modeling and sketches for this place looked very similar to the Fluxliner,

1127
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:56,560
Mark McCandless, ARV craft. Doesn't Lazar have a sample of 115 hidden away? He states he does,

1128
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,400
and I think Area 51, Bob Lazar and Flying Saucers, the documentary from Jeremy Corbell,

1129
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,720
stated that this was why the FBI raid occurred, although I don't know if they're supporting

1130
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:14,720
evidence of that. I think George Knapp stated he had a recording of the element 115 being utilized

1131
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:20,160
to power or like a makeshift reactor or something, but taped over the videotape, which is also

1132
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:28,240
not a great statement. Keep up the good work. Thank you, brother. Nightingale is the middle

1133
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:33,360
that retains its shape. Yes, this is what I myself and others have theorized was discovered at the

1134
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:40,080
Roswell crash, likely and sent to Patel as a titanium nickel alloy to study as the shape retaining

1135
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:45,760
metal or memory metals. You should look into the aerogel, air alloy vacuum drones and the U.S. Navy

1136
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:50,800
nemesis system. If the tick tax, not NHI, these systems tech may be the closest possible possible

1137
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:55,680
explanation. Cool. That's I've actually never, I think I've heard briefly of the aerogel,

1138
01:46:55,680 --> 01:47:00,400
air alloy vacuum drones, but not the U.S. Navy nemesis system. So absolutely.

1139
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:06,800
Personally, I believe the vast majority are spy satellites, UAP or spy satellites.

1140
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,840
Matt Ford posted the gloves are off at the end of a statement in the Disclosure Act getting cut.

1141
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:18,480
I assume this means catastrophic disclosure or catastrophic gorilla disclosure. Yeah,

1142
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:23,280
I mentioned this before. I'm of the mind where even with the passing of the UAPDA,

1143
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,960
to get it passed fully, there would still be arguments about eminent domain and so forth.

1144
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,600
I also think more whistleblower protections need to be put in before any meaningful whistleblowers

1145
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,480
come forth. I also do think there probably needs to be amnesty clauses for legacy program members

1146
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:43,520
and so forth. There still was some teeth missing from there and I probably catastrophic disclosure,

1147
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,160
hopefully in a non too catastrophic way is probably going to be our way forward.

1148
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,640
Dick Cheney is the head of UAP secrecy. It's fascinating. Yesterday I think Dick Cheney was

1149
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:58,720
also mentioned by, he was mentioned by Barish, right, as J2 in the Majestic 12. I think so.

1150
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,560
What do you make of the claims that the ARVs are using zero point free energy systems? I think that,

1151
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,280
especially with the flux liner from Mark McCandless, that he states is under

1152
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:18,000
kind of zero point and so forth. Sorry. I probably say that there's some validity to these claims,

1153
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,280
early MHD anti-gravity systems, electro-gravidics, especially the Mark McCandless story just because

1154
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:29,680
I think that of most of the whistleblowers Greer talked to in the 2001 disclosure project,

1155
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:33,760
I think McCandless probably has the most interesting and fascinating story and something that is

1156
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:43,600
still very relevant to today. So I think that a zero point, I've heard rumors that of various types

1157
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:48,640
of propulsion systems for ARVs, including electro-gravidics and so forth, but zero point,

1158
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:52,240
that corresponds to McCandless's story, and I find that a fantastic one.

1159
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:58,640
The Susan Goev, Rogan. Two detailed, like Cliff Stone and Dan Eyre. Yeah, Clifford Stone,

1160
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,840
that is somebody I particularly left out at the Kecksburg video. He made outstanding comments

1161
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,000
on Kecksburg, but he is somebody just because I wanted to analyze fully because of some of his

1162
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:16,400
claims being a little bit too descriptive and final that just to leave out. Oh, no, no, no,

1163
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,360
you're good, George. It's okay. I'm not a chemist. I'm sure a lot of people aren't chemists. There's

1164
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:26,320
a lot of dang elements to keep track of. Have I heard of the Eyes on Cinema YouTube channel? How

1165
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:30,880
many archived recordings video? I don't know how the heck they get their files, but Eyes on Cinema

1166
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,920
is great. I'd love to know who actually runs the account. It seems like they have media that has

1167
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:40,800
never been seen before. Their new video on Area 51 is also great. I think they posted it a day or

1168
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:47,200
two, so I'd really recommend watching that. According to Wikipedia, Mozgovium, this is in

1169
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:52,080
relation to Bob Lazar and Element 115, is a super heavy synthetic radioactive chemical element, also

1170
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:57,520
known as EK-A-Bismuth. Richard Dolan supposes metamaterial is a bismuth alloy. Is there a

1171
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:02,320
connection? I'm not sure, but I've also heard of the bismuth connection, but I do not know. I don't

1172
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:07,120
even know if there's been able to be a Mozgovium that's been a stable element. I think it decays

1173
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:12,160
after a very, very, very short period, and there's never as far to the length of my knowledge.

1174
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:20,000
Lab's been a stable version of Mozgovium. Rogan is so flip floppy, it honestly annoys me. He'll be

1175
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,560
all in one secret, then says his BS in the next podcast. Yeah, I used to be a huge Joe fan, but

1176
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,800
I've had a little bit of a grudge against him ever since Grush was on there. I really don't like the

1177
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:35,840
way he treated Grush. Maybe they just, when wandering around and about, forgot to turn on the

1178
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,360
cloaking, we stumble upon their ship and they came back to a bunch of boomsticks monkeys forming on

1179
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:45,040
their ship quite possibly. Yeah, there are stories of cloaked UAP, especially with Danny Sheehan

1180
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:50,240
talking about the golden domes detection methods, which can actually detect cloaked UAP. Of course,

1181
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:54,880
low observability is one of the six observables, according to Lou Elizondo. So maybe they go out

1182
01:50:54,880 --> 01:51:01,440
to forage some berries and come back to that. The recent Eyes on Cinema school sighting was that on

1183
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:09,440
Westall School in Australia, because that's a great case. As a Greek, I could very clearly read

1184
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:15,200
the engravings on the Roswell Debris. It reads, which means freedom, maybe a hoax. Cool. Are you

1185
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:21,200
talking about like the eye beam from Jesse Marcel Sr. and Jr.? Is there anything to Jason

1186
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,160
say? He seems low credibility. Eric Davis said he lied about being one of Grush's 40.

1187
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:31,440
Him being on Twitter, Gary Nolan criticized him too. I think we do have to step back from Eric

1188
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,280
Davis a little bit on there. Eric Davis has been chatting quite a bit lately, especially about Lou

1189
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:42,800
too. I think that I am trying to analyze Sans' story in a vacuum far away from the Twitter stuff

1190
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,800
and a lot of the kind of Twitter space that has come with it. I know multiple intelligence community

1191
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:56,960
people that all think Jason Sans is a fantastic person. They hold him to a huge, they hold him to

1192
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,560
such a high regard. They say he's a wonderful human. The reason why he may have gone on Twitter and

1193
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:06,320
so forth was just because he's that type of guy who just talks quite a bit. So these are people

1194
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:10,960
I trust and they all speak very highly of Sans. They can, of course, can't prove his story,

1195
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:17,360
but they all support Sans. So I'm trying to approach Sans' story from a lens of kind of openness,

1196
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:21,920
just because I would like to speak to him if I get the chance to. But I do think that sometimes

1197
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,760
Sans doesn't really draw the line where he's speculating versus talking about firsthand

1198
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:32,640
knowledge. And I think that can be a little bit of a problem. The person who breaks the biggest

1199
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:36,400
story in history is not going to prison, especially as reported, their deaths are attributed to the

1200
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:42,560
program. Yeah, but if it's a firsthand witness, they could lose their pension and if they're not

1201
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,880
getting a big media deal or something like that, they and their family will have no money.

1202
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,880
That's at least what I know is an issue with some whistleblowers, not the threat of death,

1203
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:56,640
but the threat of pension pension removal. I would bet Kissinger was MJ one up until his passing.

1204
01:52:56,640 --> 01:53:01,440
I think according to British Kissinger was like MJ five, MJ six. There was another person that

1205
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:06,320
had implicated Kissinger in MJ 12. I can't remember who it was. What kind of music does

1206
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:13,200
Gerb listen to? I'm a big hip hop head. But I do not like a pop hip hop. So I'm a bit more classic

1207
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:18,720
of like, I like like the old Kendrick Lamar Denzel Curry, some classic 90s rap. I also like

1208
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:22,960
electronic music in Juno Deep. They're probably my favorite producer. I love listening to their

1209
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,880
projects, but a little bit of everything, man. I'm just not a big pop music kind of guy.

1210
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,320
Max Barr says, do you think it's morally right to keep zero point energy from the public to the

1211
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:36,160
disclosure of zero point collapse or civilization due to economic instability or something else?

1212
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:42,880
I feel like this is such a difficult question to ask now, especially if zero point energy

1213
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:49,200
systems have been in practice for decades, if for years, if not decades, right now, the introduction

1214
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:55,360
of zero points systems, I think would certainly collapse economies and collapse systems as we

1215
01:53:55,360 --> 01:54:00,480
know it might have to completely shift to a global resource based economy as zero point systems would

1216
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:06,880
fix most energy crisis and production crisis and travel crisis and fossil fuels. I do think

1217
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,480
it's morally wrong to have kept zero point energy from the public, especially if it was

1218
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:18,880
conceived back 50, 60, 70s or so on, but also having that sort of, if for the average person to

1219
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:25,600
have access to that sort of technology could be very dangerous. Just like nuclear, the formation

1220
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:29,920
of a nuclear bomb, the blueprints are kept classified, but the actual knowledge and use of

1221
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:34,160
nuclear technology is not, I think zero point systems should be the same. But yes, I do think

1222
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:38,560
it's morally wrong, but that raises such a quandary of having to completely reassess how

1223
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:41,760
global economies, global markets and global governments work.

1224
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:48,880
McCandless could have been fed disinformation. Mark never saw anything, but his friend told

1225
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:54,640
him about it. His friend is Brad Sorensen, and do I think Brad Sorensen is disinfo? No, I do not.

1226
01:54:56,720 --> 01:55:00,880
My pupils, my boy, those pupils, what are you on, my friend? A little bit of cold brew

1227
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:05,440
and some bright lights, man, some bright lights and trying to read. Nothing, nothing else.

1228
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:09,920
Have I read through imminent? Yes, yes, I have actually read it in almost reverse order. I've

1229
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:16,320
read it on a chat on a specific chapter basis. Any thoughts on why conventional jet aircraft

1230
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:21,360
and weapon systems continue to be developed if ARV exists, money laundering, ARV may not be

1231
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:29,040
reliably prohibitively expensive for mass production. Yeah, who knows the cost of producing

1232
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:34,880
one ARV craft? Who is in control of the ARV, what program? There could possibly be elements of the

1233
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:40,480
breakaway type civilization here just because Locking Martin has, let's say, a Martin McCandless's

1234
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:46,000
flux liner doesn't mean it's going to be shared and doesn't mean if they have one flux liner,

1235
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,840
doesn't mean it's going to be put into production or its blueprints are going to be shared to keep

1236
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:56,400
an asymmetric advantage. Of course, as well as David Grush says that the reverse engineering

1237
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:01,840
is used for feudalistic dominance and asymmetrical advantages. So I think there's

1238
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:06,800
quite a few reasons why. Not sure all your cards yet. Who knows, maybe if there was a

1239
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:11,680
global conflict, you would see a Northrop Grumman or Locking Martin ARV. I certainly like to,

1240
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:18,800
but not in that context. No one wants to know Ross Colt Hart's source if he revealed the location.

1241
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,880
Okay, while no one wants to know Ross Colt Hart's source, if he revealed the location

1242
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:30,080
with the UFO under the building, would you want to go ninja? If he revealed the location,

1243
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:36,880
would I, I just, as far as I know, there could be national security implications and violations

1244
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:43,360
if he revealed this place. If he did, ninja in the sense of researching for probably 30 hours

1245
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:48,800
nonstop to try to get to the bottom of this. Yes, absolutely. Okay, recording to McCandless,

1246
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,920
someone should file a FOIA to verify the presence of the US Senator that McCandless alleges was

1247
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,240
president at the air show and saw the ARBs. Oh, okay, this is in my notes, man. What was the,

1248
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:03,680
I just wrote this down, who Brad Sorenson said he was with. He said it was a former

1249
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:11,520
like director of some sort of intelligence director, a tall white Italian man with white hair.

1250
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:15,040
He names the name who he thought it was. I just can't remember it right now, but

1251
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:22,160
yeah, absolutely. That individual is no longer with us. I wanted to contact him, possibly his

1252
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:27,040
children. Ryan would always talk about sometimes if kids are adults, now of their parents implicating

1253
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,640
some of these stories, just reach out to them, see if they know anything about it. So absolutely.

1254
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:38,800
That's his right to change his mind in what, in what, oh, in regards to Joe. Yeah, I think it's

1255
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,840
just towards the treatment of guests in relation to Bob Lazar versus people like Grush and Elizondo.

1256
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,000
It's just a bit strange. What is your favorite case of antiquity? I understand Lou being more

1257
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,800
interested in modern incidents, pre-reports, pre-47. Of course, there's the Aurora incident,

1258
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:59,440
but I'd say Cape Girardeau, 1941. Yeah, Kai, I'll find the name and I'll let you know. I haven't

1259
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:05,120
written down. I just don't have the notebook on me right now, but yes. Got to check out the Groom

1260
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:08,880
Lake mine Ryan Wood was talking about. I found a few articles, Nothing Juicy, not even sure how to

1261
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,600
start that one. Yeah, I think it's a boron mine right in the Groom Lake area, which would be the

1262
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:18,400
perfect foundation for an underground facility. And that was started well before the creation of

1263
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:23,120
the Area 51 facility, which is mentioned, which is managed by Edwards near at Groom Lake.

1264
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:31,360
The I-beam Reads Freedom. Do you know if Jesse Marcel has sketched out what he saw the symbols

1265
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:36,560
specifically because I see a lot of I-beam photos and so forth, but I don't know if the symbols are

1266
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:43,840
exactly true to exactly what Jesse described. Everybody's going to pretend, put some shades on.

1267
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:48,400
Well, that's because I got a light right in front of me, man. But I think my pupils are

1268
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:54,160
normal sized, I think. I don't see anything wrong with my pupils. But who knows, man.

1269
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:58,160
The fact that MH370 videos are so compelling yet you won't even give it on is concerning.

1270
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:05,760
I'm sorry that it's concerning to you, but I won't. My honest opinion is that I'm just

1271
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:10,240
not engaged with the videos right now. And that's because I know there's so much toxicity

1272
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:14,240
and drama around them. And also, my research style, there's so much other stuff I'm trying to

1273
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:19,520
focus on right now that I will leave the MH370 videos to others at the moment.

1274
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:26,880
Have you read imminent? And any comment on the Divide UFO Talking Heads are having on

1275
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:32,080
Elizondo stating, overstating his role and responsibilities at ATIP and Stratton going

1276
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:36,960
to release his own book. This has become such a conundrum, right? And there's been so many

1277
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,680
like Twitter personalities and Twitter people discussing this. And

1278
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:50,000
John Greenwald made a great video with the OSAP ATIP documents. I really don't know what to make of

1279
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:58,160
it. I really don't. There's just so much foreign against Lou. But do I think Lou is dishonest and

1280
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:04,000
a liar? No. But maybe there's some overstating his role and so forth. But hopefully we can get to

1281
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,400
the bottom of this. I'm sorry. I know I'm kind of rambling on that subject. It's been really

1282
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:11,760
weird to follow. And it seems like every day there's a new development or a new statement from

1283
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:17,280
Stratton, Stratton's wife, Eric Davis, and so forth. OpTV, thank you so much, man. Been here

1284
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:23,680
since 3K. I know a lot of people have. I appreciate that. Corona. Eric Weinstein suggests if NHI

1285
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:27,040
has time travel, they could be looping back to Preventus from getting evidence of them. We need

1286
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,880
our own disinformation countermeasures for disclosure to make that happen. If they're looping back

1287
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,720
in time, that introduced the awesome theory of the bootstrap paradox. If they're looping back in

1288
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:39,360
time because then eventually in the future, that same civilization will go back in time. And that

1289
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:45,040
means there's an endless loop of these NHI going back. That's a fun time travel paradox to go down.

1290
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:50,240
Eric Weinstein, I'm excited. I'm happy he started to talk more about UAP. I think Eric Weinstein

1291
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:55,200
is extremely intelligent. Sometimes he is a little bit too intelligent for his own good,

1292
02:00:55,200 --> 02:01:01,200
but I'd like to see him weigh in more on NHI. The issue of anti-gravity is extremely difficult.

1293
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:04,720
In one side, it can transform the planet into eotopia. Under a year on the other side, it can

1294
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:09,920
trigger World War III in a few hours. Absolutely. And the study of anti-gravity of late, Jesse

1295
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:15,120
Michaels has been knocking out the park with his videos. What's an ARV? Oh, sorry if we haven't

1296
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:20,960
talked about this. Yeah, HECOLOGY mentioned an alien reproduction vehicle. This term was coined by

1297
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:27,520
Mark McCandlish when his friend Brad Sorensen stated at Norton Air Base in 1988, November,

1298
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:32,800
at an air show. He was taken to a classified division with three craft of a kind of a saucer

1299
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,120
type shape, not like two saucer dishes pressed against each other, but like the top half of the

1300
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:41,840
saucer with a ball on top were called alien reproduction vehicles came in three sizes operated

1301
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:45,840
off of I think Sirpointe Energy, possibly ElectroGravityx or MHC Plasma. But yes.

1302
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,720
Have you read the account of Dan Sherman above black? No, this is still at the top of my list

1303
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:54,560
because I've been recommended so much, but I'll be fully honest, I haven't been able to get through

1304
02:01:54,560 --> 02:02:00,640
it yet. But I really want to. Have you heard of the Q94 non-human tissue sample? Is this the

1305
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:05,040
implant? I can't remember. Is this the implant everybody's been talking about?

1306
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:12,320
Hello, Eric Davis's boss reported to Lou Elizondo, and that was that was how put off or

1307
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:16,880
I can't remember. There's so many dang names. I'm having trouble remembering right now.

1308
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:21,680
Sorry about that. Can't wait to read about the Scott Andrews story when it comes out.

1309
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,880
Everyone seemed to have forgotten about that one, including myself. Scott Andrews,

1310
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:29,280
that's on the tip of my tongue. Shardles remind me of the Scott Andrews story. I know this,

1311
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:34,240
but I'm forgetting. Are there alleged crash retrievals in Florida? No, but I think there's

1312
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:38,960
McDale Air Force Base in Florida, which has been implicated with retrieval stories and so forth.

1313
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,840
As far as I know, I can't think of any retrieval stories off the top of my head,

1314
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:47,600
but there is McDale AFB, which is of interest. Of course, Joe has the right to change mine,

1315
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:52,000
but it's disingenuous to be one way with one guest and the next have a different guest and

1316
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,080
say it's all probably BS. I agree. Yeah, I just don't like how he talked about,

1317
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:03,200
talked to Grush and reference him. This guy knows what he's talking about. That's why

1318
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:06,960
you're getting this. I appreciate that. A lot of the time I ramble, man. I only know what I'm

1319
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:11,200
talking about when I sit down, when I have time to sit down and write like a 7,000 word

1320
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:15,040
script and then record it. That's when I know what I'm talking about. Otherwise, I can ramble.

1321
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:21,360
Any cool dreams recently? No, not really. My dreams are always nonsense. Absolute nonsense,

1322
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:26,480
man, involving sharks or stuff like that. I never have anything important in my dreams.

1323
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,920
What do you think of the carrot documents leak and how they compare to the 4chan EBO?

1324
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:36,880
LARP leaker. We talked about this a little bit earlier. The EBO, there's so much interest in

1325
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:41,440
this. I can't remember what individual said he had a biology background from med school,

1326
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,640
but we're going to talk about the whole dang documents. We can finally try and reach a bit

1327
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:48,960
of a conclusion or some progress here on the channel. New to your channel since last week.

1328
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,600
You're the best. You're the best, man. Thank you for joining, dude. Thank you.

1329
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:57,520
Herrera's case is so significant because it implies special role for people with

1330
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,760
sixth sense. If true, this could alter the human evolution goes. Maybe the biological part is the

1331
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:07,760
core secret, possibly. Remember, Dr. Eric A. Walker in his interviews with Henry Victorian,

1332
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:15,680
aka, no, Armin Victorian, aka Henry, as of the hell in 1980s, when Dr. Eric A. Walker was asked

1333
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:20,400
about UAP reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs because he was implicated by Robert

1334
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:26,080
Sarbacher, the physicist of the Joint Research and Development Board and co-worker of Vanavar

1335
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:31,120
Bush stated that to gain access to these programs, he said to as of the hell and he proposed the

1336
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:34,800
question, what do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it, you won't be invited involved in

1337
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:40,480
these programs. We also know SAIC, SRI International, focused quite a bit on psionics and human

1338
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:44,880
consciousness developments and so forth. And we know that Ross Colt Hartnest talked to him history

1339
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:53,040
about a consciousness connection to operate with NHI craft. So very interesting. Any news about Japan?

1340
02:04:54,240 --> 02:05:00,800
No, not much. In fact, I don't really know any stories of Japan and UAP. So that actually

1341
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:07,120
might be interesting to me. There was an article talking about Simon and Schuster publishers winning

1342
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:10,880
a bidding war for the rights to the Scott Andrews story. Remind me the Scott Andrews story. I'm

1343
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:16,160
trying to try to remember. The psychology of why someone would falsely come out as a UFO whistleblower

1344
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:20,240
is very interesting. Doing so seems to have more negatives than positives. It is interesting.

1345
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,120
I'm trying to, you know, of course, maybe some people are trying to get like movie deals or book

1346
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:32,800
deals. You know, I'm no comment on Bob Lazar, but you know, so I could see somebody doing that to

1347
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:37,760
kind of get documentaries made about them. Like, and I think Bob Lazar back in the day

1348
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:43,120
sold a videotape of the secrets of S4. So possibly reasons like that. I'm not implicating Bob Lazar.

1349
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:47,760
It's just it is the psychology is fascinating. I hope the megalodon exists. I hope not, man.

1350
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:53,520
You want to sleep in swim in deep water and see one of those. Has anybody ever postulated a way

1351
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:58,640
to augment the function of one's own coddit of petumen? I don't know what that is. I'm guessing

1352
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:03,840
it's part of a brain. So fill me in, man. And I'm probably about to sound really stupid for not knowing

1353
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:09,040
what that is, but please Scott Andrews had some health complications that some adult finds out as

1354
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:13,760
a child. He doesn't remember. Apparently worked for NASA as a 12 year old straight up born. Oh,

1355
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:19,920
okay. So like the gate program project Monarch, I talked to a few people about that at this point.

1356
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:27,440
And that is really disturbing. Kind of like the essence of this are like brainwashing programs

1357
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:33,920
for children to set them up as agents for CIA or other things to create like a dissociative

1358
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:40,400
dissociative state within them so they can be more responsive to influence. That is really

1359
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:45,680
disturbing. Heard any stories about the earliest efforts to pilot recovered craft? Do you think

1360
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:49,520
the level of experimentation was happening during or after World War Two? My guess would be after

1361
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:55,680
and that it's going to be a video soon with Michael Schratt who has a deep history in ARV

1362
02:06:55,680 --> 02:07:00,400
stories. If I can get him in Ryan Wood, I know Ryan Wood said he talked to Schratt because there's,

1363
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:05,040
I think there's stories of 60s and possibly 50s of these craft being flown around.

1364
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:11,680
Chris Lado, Chris Lado, of the Lado files is actively investigating the Norway light,

1365
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,240
the Heslin lights and produce some great content. Yes, he has. Chris Lado's, I think,

1366
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:20,880
is documentary on the turkey sighting, this all time classic video. Yeah, Chris has done some,

1367
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:25,120
Chris has done some fantastic work and I think these are the Heslin lights. He's been on this case

1368
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:29,520
for a little bit over a year and yeah, Chris is great, great. Lua Alizando vowed for Scott

1369
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:35,360
Anders being legit. Cool. I had no idea. Have you researched any plumber firefighters from

1370
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:39,600
Antarctica who are also getaway drivers for billionaires who are trained for remote viewing

1371
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:45,360
as children? Is this, this sounds like Eric Hecker. This sounds quite a bit like Eric Hecker.

1372
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:49,040
Did he claim all of the the rest of the stuff getaway drivers for billionaires who are trained

1373
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:55,360
for, I wouldn't be surprised. Maybe they found a way to teach people how to unlock the psychic

1374
02:07:55,360 --> 02:08:00,000
aspect of their brains by the help of the Monroe Institute probably and I think according to some

1375
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,680
of the research, some people are more predisposed to stuff such as this. I had a person reach out to

1376
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:11,120
me stating they were adept in remote viewing and hopefully I can talk to them and see if

1377
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:17,200
their process and if there's validity to this because I'm just, I would love to learn more

1378
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:22,160
and kind of have a firsthand witness of remote viewing and some more complicated psionic stuff

1379
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:25,760
because I talk about all the time it's pretty uncomfortable territory for me just because

1380
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:32,240
I'm such a nuts and bolts guy. I just so much into research and kind of what I know and what

1381
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:36,320
I'm comfortable with. So yeah, an opportunity to learn more is great for me. Have you seen

1382
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:40,640
The Abyss, James Cameron, Underwater Aliens? Yes, that's a great movie. As a kid, you know,

1383
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:48,160
when the kind of the CGI water thing makes its way into the crew bay scared me tremendously.

1384
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:52,480
Do I think Bob Lazar is legit or a liar? I say this all the time. I stay away from Bob because

1385
02:08:52,480 --> 02:09:00,480
my own bias, I cannot reach an unbiased conclusion. Justin Bush wanted to get into

1386
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:04,640
contact with Herrera, but especially his insider and he complained of harassment and hacking from

1387
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:11,360
Black Ops on an Abduct T support group. Yes, I think the harassment from him involved a triangular

1388
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:15,840
shapecraft. Justin Bush has a book. I haven't been able to read through it yet, but I will post it

1389
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:20,080
because I think it is worth a read and I would like to read it and talk to him once I can.

1390
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:26,720
In Lou Kit Green, Nolan's Tales, the Caudette Petuman is part of the Basil

1391
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:33,040
in Gilea. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to pronounce morphological different in experiences.

1392
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:37,600
We want to know how to make it bigger. Part of the brain. Interesting. I would love to learn more

1393
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:42,880
if you would want to sit down and kind of explain to me more of the anatomy of that part of the

1394
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:47,840
brain and so forth and possible theories on how to increase. I would love to learn more.

1395
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:55,360
Have I watched Heard Stories Lost? Interesting channel about UFOs in Scandinavia mostly.

1396
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:02,240
No, but I should. My girlfriend's from Norway. That would be a really great channel to sit down

1397
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:10,400
and watch with her. Have I heard of research, Dan Brisch? Yes. We talked about this a couple

1398
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:15,040
times. I'll probably say I'll probably do like another six months or a year of research on him

1399
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:20,320
before any discussion of him in videos and so forth. But his interview is two hour long.

1400
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:25,840
One certainly is very interesting. Yes, I'm sorry. I know I cannot pronounce things well at all.

1401
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:32,320
Have I heard of Jack Sarfati? Yes, I have. In fact, he commented on a recent video of mine

1402
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:41,920
and I was thrilled to see it. This was the Off-World Technologies division. He said that

1403
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:45,520
he said something like the beginning was great, but the physics at the end in terms of Salvador

1404
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:50,240
Pais was incorrect. Now, of course, I responded to that and I'm going to try to talk to him because,

1405
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:55,440
yes, please. The Norway diving was cut short because of inclement weather. One short dive

1406
02:10:55,440 --> 02:11:01,200
is hardly definitive. The 1967 case, yeah, I couldn't imagine diving in those seas.

1407
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:06,160
Guys, we'll do like 10 more minutes and then we'll hit the road. Let me get through these

1408
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:10,400
questions. But next Sunday, I talked to, if any of you guys are on Reddit and know the account

1409
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:15,600
Voller Records, he has posted at this point a seven, almost eight-part series on crash retrievals,

1410
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:19,680
George W. Bush, Alan Doliz, and so forth and all these connections. I've talked to him. His

1411
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:23,600
research is so dang fantastic. I want to have him on live and discuss his research. So if you

1412
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:31,120
guys know that, probably next week, we're going to talk. This page is about to blow up. I hope so,

1413
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:35,200
man. But do you ever worry about releasing too many long-form videos and using up content before

1414
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:43,280
the algorithm hits? No. The thing is, there is so much to speak about. And with some cases,

1415
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:48,800
I might be able to revisit with new information. Like I know Kingman right now, I could revisit

1416
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,400
and make a whole new video of it with improved editing and so forth. So if I ever do that,

1417
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:57,360
need to make a new video on something, I'll fully explain why. Also, I hope as I grow also,

1418
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:03,760
I can, I have the opportunity to talk more to whistleblowers and so forth. So no, I'm not worried.

1419
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:08,240
There are, I can think of on the top of my head, 10 crash retrieval cases alone I'd like to cover.

1420
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:15,040
Witness list redacted another eight to 12 entries. UFO whistleblowers, another eight to 10 entries.

1421
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:20,960
So I got plenty on the mind. Plenty. If the 2004 JSOC vs. Lockheed story is legit,

1422
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:24,960
then Gary Nolan proposing parallel recovery team sounds extremely ill advised. Yes, thank you.

1423
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,320
That's what we were talking about earlier. Let's just say that the Lockheed recovery

1424
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:32,800
team who killed blue on blue action killed JSOC members in this alleged 2004 incident.

1425
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:40,160
A bunch of a presumably non tier one personnel going to try and retrieve UAP before these

1426
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:44,400
retrieval teams sounds like a death sentence. It's, it really sounds like it does.

1427
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:50,400
Uh, Lou also, okay. Lou can't pronounce either. Good. If Lou can't pronounce, then I'm in good

1428
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:54,320
company. The gateway tapes are on Reddit. I downloaded them, but haven't tried yet. Gateway in

1429
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:59,920
a, uh, okay. Yeah. Gate programs really interesting. Lou talked about part of the brain psychic

1430
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:04,080
possibilities a few times in his book. Yes, he has. And now at this point, multiple people have. And

1431
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:08,880
I was, I was a little bit surprised and imminent Lou opened up so much about kind of a psionic

1432
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:13,520
potential and so forth. Bradley, congrats on 10 K. Thank you so much, bro. I appreciate that.

1433
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:17,680
I appreciate every single one of you imminent has a section on the part of the brain and it's

1434
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:23,280
weird relation to, to experiences bigger and denser apparently. Yes, but I am just so, uh,

1435
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:29,920
kind of, I'm non plus when it comes to, uh, uh, neurology and brain research. I'll fully admit

1436
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:35,360
I non plus. Do you think the fly by video is legit? I think it looks too real to be CGI. I

1437
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:41,200
lean, I lean a little bit towards, uh, so here's the thing, you know, the, the stories of Lou

1438
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:46,880
Elizondo and Chris Mellon, about 23 minute footage of like a, a craft getting really close to a,

1439
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:51,920
a jet or a pilot. I thought fly by may have been that video. And I actually asked Chris Mellon

1440
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:58,240
and he said, no, the shape was nothing like it. Um, I still, I'd want to revisit fly by a little

1441
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:05,680
bit more, but I, I looked at it pretty favorably, uh, pretty favorably parents. Fantastic show.

1442
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:09,280
Why do you think they talk about craft and retrievals, but not who or what is operating them?

1443
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:13,360
Thank you. I really appreciate that. I think the conversation is shifting, uh, to discussing

1444
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:18,560
biologics. I think, uh, by all biologics, uh, operating craft has been lost throughout time

1445
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:22,880
when discussing crash retrievals. And I'm not really sure why, besides the fact this is always

1446
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,280
the most contentious part of a crash retrieval story. Uh, historically fantastic researchers

1447
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:31,520
like Leonard Stringfield, uh, state and freedmen have never shied away from talking about bodies

1448
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:35,600
and have discussed them at length. So I think when you talk about the craft, if it's supposedly

1449
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:40,800
occupied, you also talk about the bodies. And I'm just really glad that, uh, biologics has made

1450
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:46,800
its way into the record, non-human biologics. The Kometa report is very validating. Uh,

1451
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:53,280
the Kometa report, I might not be familiar. Let me know. In my last video, I, uh, pronounced

1452
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:58,720
Shreveport, but it's Shreveport. I used to live right by, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll, I'll

1453
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:03,760
gladly take any correction in my pronunciation. I know it's always so bad. Eric Hecker claims

1454
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,920
he still gets work in Antarctica after whistleblowing their nuclear reactor in space laser

1455
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:12,240
earthquake weapons. I can also communicate with the off-world earth military fleet. Didn't he say

1456
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:18,400
the Antarctic neutrino detector was some sort of directed energy weapon? And I correct me if I'm

1457
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:22,800
wrong, but I do not understand a way in which those physics would work. Okay. Mentioning to Eric,

1458
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:30,640
why is my name UAP, uh, Gerb, that, so Gerb is just my nickname. So UAP Gerb, I wanted something

1459
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:39,280
for the channel, short and sweet versus like, um, uh, the UAP research files and video, something

1460
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:45,120
like that. I want it short and sweet. Do you think, uh, UAP NHI stories can still manifest as ghost

1461
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:51,120
stories rather than UAP specifically? According to, uh, guys like Jacques Valais has booked dimensions

1462
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:56,000
and forbidden sciences. Uh, UAP phenomenon can manifest itself in different ways. This is an

1463
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:00,880
area of research that I myself, besides reading Jacques Valais, I'm not too well versed in. I

1464
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:04,960
still think kind of the hitchhiker effect and the high strangeness around UAP is still something that

1465
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,960
I try and wrap my head around and kind of make sense of when I read about it in stories, you know,

1466
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:15,600
Lou talking about orbs in his home and so forth. But, uh, I, I'm trying to look at more stories

1467
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:21,760
where high strangeness is involved, especially stuff like, uh, Skinwalker Ranch. Congrats on 10K,

1468
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,680
100K next. I hope so. What do you hope to see for the rest of 2024? Great show.

1469
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:30,720
I hope to see hearings in, um, November and I hope to go there as well as a possible

1470
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:33,920
sole foundation. I hope to see new firsthand whistleblowers.

1471
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:42,880
Can RA or MS testify at the house hearing? Both of these individuals I have gotten, uh,

1472
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:49,920
in contact with more powerful people than I who have more access to, uh, policy and so forth. So

1473
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:57,520
I know both of them were, um, somewhat agreeable to this idea. It is out of my hands now. Of course,

1474
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:04,480
I've still talked to them about it, but I really hope so because they are not as scared as, uh,

1475
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:11,600
one witness that I have spoken about by the name of TB. Multiple small terror hurts wave, uh, guides

1476
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:14,560
installed on the skin of the craft is the thing required to operate. At least some of them it

1477
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:21,040
seems possibly. Yes, it does seem. There's also stories in, um, and small paneling to, to dissipate

1478
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:27,760
heat and so forth. But yes, uh, uh, I, uh, I'm hoping to have a conversation with a good friend

1479
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:33,440
of mine and another content creator offline about kind of the physics of ARV very soon. Kai, I know

1480
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:38,880
you'll really enjoy that and kind of, uh, have a little bit more, uh, a body of, of things to talk

1481
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:42,960
about. Are we ever going to see the Grush op-ed hear anything behind the screens? I, somebody

1482
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:46,320
was trying to push the book thing. I don't think there's any validity to that. I don't think there's

1483
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:52,320
evidence for that. I think that Grush is working hard behind the scenes and I do not think he is

1484
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:58,720
being lazy. If anything, his, uh, his, uh, op-ed is probably being held up still. The Locky Martin

1485
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:04,240
JSOC thing, if true, could have, uh, incited a consolidation of, uh, direct, directorates,

1486
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:07,840
et cetera, around the time of the JSOC event. Look at that timeframe could yield something

1487
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,720
corroborative. Absolutely. As well as like a 94, the reorganization of SAPOC into the program

1488
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:18,560
and so forth. This, I think the 1990 to 2010 is a very, very, very crucial two decade period to look

1489
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:25,200
for. This is six. I got this from, uh, Saucerco, man. Tell him to sponsor me. I try all the time to DM

1490
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:30,400
them. I'd love to rep their merch. I'd love to, to shout them out on the video, but Saucerco, I,

1491
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:36,880
I wish, I wish. Santiago, yes, we talked about this earlier. I do not, I think the blocking of the

1492
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:42,160
UAPDA is a shame and it definitely sucks. I do not think it hurts disclosure too much. I think

1493
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:46,480
even with the UAPDA passing, there would still be, uh, quite a few roadblocks in terms of the

1494
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:52,000
settlement of eminent domain, as well as an executive order under Obama that automatically omits, uh,

1495
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,960
things dealing with non-human intelligence, including AI, to be automatically, uh, do,

1496
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:02,720
not need to be declassified. So I think we're okay. Uh, I still have high hopes that

1497
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:08,560
whistle, various whistleblowers will come forward. I very much hope so. I posted as, uh,

1498
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:12,240
mugs on Discord. I will review it. Yes. There's plenty of information out there. I will review

1499
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:18,160
it. Yes. After the live stream. What do you think of, uh, Herrera's claims that the ARV was possibly

1500
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:24,880
trafficking children? P three assets, as he says, P three assets. And, um, I think that there is

1501
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:31,200
quite a bit to this story of, of interest. Of course, you guys probably know me and Joey as the

1502
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:36,480
guys who have covered Michael more than anybody. So yes, I, uh, Michael says that these are referred

1503
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:42,960
to as pink assets or P three to use their, uh, their capabilities of their mind to interface

1504
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:50,000
and pilot or draw in craft. Can you recommend any subreddits to your viewers on the UAP topic?

1505
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:56,640
So some of the bigger ones, like, uh, uh, UFOs and aliens can get a bit unfocused. I like UFOB.

1506
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:01,920
I like crash retrievals. It's a really small one. Um, but UFOB is a great one. And also in the

1507
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:07,200
Discord, we talk a lot about, uh, good stuff. There's a lot of really smart people in the Discord.

1508
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,760
People smarter than I. So I recommend joining that if you have not.

1509
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:15,760
Uh, okay. Oh, you're talking about Reed's video from 96. I will check it out. Yes.

1510
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:19,440
Have you heard anything about James Webb detected something headed towards earth and

1511
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:24,000
making, uh, course corrections? Yes, I have. Uh, I'm, uh, I've heard all the rumors and stuff. I

1512
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,760
probably won't focus on that now just because there's so much, uh, else to research. This reminded

1513
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:33,440
me a little bit of Avi Loeb and Muah Muah back in, uh, I think 2021, 2022. Some people say the UAPDA

1514
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:36,960
won't do anything even if it gets passed because it's modeled after the JFK one. Yes. Which took

1515
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:41,600
27 years to release. Um, um, I had a 27 year time from nothing. At least it didn't do anything to

1516
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,800
the JFK mystery. What do you think about this notion? Yes. Absolutely. There's also executive

1517
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:48,240
orders under Obama and other stuff that could have still kept this information from being

1518
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:52,960
classified. Everybody forgets a lot of new or a lot of UAP stuff is likely, uh, misclassified as

1519
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:58,480
as a foreign nuclear material, which is born classified and still devoid of, of mandatory

1520
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:03,520
declassification. Uh, there is no telling that these legacy programs could have been outed.

1521
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:09,120
I think our bet, I agree. Our best option is catastrophic disclosure. Hopefully we can get

1522
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:13,360
enough firsthand whistleblowers and testimony coming forward with evidence. Uh, I thought

1523
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:17,760
this is what I would like to see. Okay. You're talking to Talon. You are talking about, uh,

1524
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:23,360
96 and I will read all of this on Reddit rectified. What's up, dude? Any thoughts on the

1525
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:27,760
bismuth, magnesium, metamaterial, leu, leopard reference in the people article, any recollection

1526
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:32,480
of bismuth or purple, huge material recovered in crash retrieval purple, huge material and bismuth.

1527
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:36,480
I'm not sure. I'd like to read a little bit more about Gary Nolan's work with metamaterials

1528
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:40,960
and bismuth as well. Cause bismuth seems to be a material that comes up quite a bit,

1529
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:47,040
but I can't reference specific cases off of my head. Okay. Hackology has put a few up there.

1530
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:57,680
UFOs, NHI, exointelligence, UFO pilot reports, UFO, UK, UFO, EU, crash retrievals, crash retrievals

1531
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:01,920
is great. It's a really small one, but the posts are kind of few and far between, but they do post

1532
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:06,880
is fantastic. So I'd recommend checking that out. And our usos with that, my friends, we shall call

1533
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:12,240
it a day today. I want to thank everybody again for a 10 K subs. And I hope everybody enjoyed

1534
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:16,960
the research we did earlier in the video. I'll post the links. I really recommend everybody

1535
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:22,960
check out the archived version of Chris Sharpe's article before it was before the specific mentions

1536
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:30,080
of neuro and so forth were brought up. And so that's a lot more USO research and USO retrievals

1537
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:36,640
to focus on. And again, guys, thank you so much for the 10 K huge plans. Eventually I want to do

1538
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:40,880
a live every Sunday work on my long form videos and then possibly do an interview every now and

1539
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:45,200
then I'd love to interview more people, but I'm not going to make interviews where I just sit down

1540
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:48,960
on zoom or in person, the bulk of my content, because I think that detracts from my research.

1541
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:52,320
And that's not what my style is about. But I think it could be a great supplement in the

1542
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:56,400
meantime, it's between my long form research videos. So if everybody likes that, we'll do that.

1543
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:01,040
And other than that, I'll see you guys next Sunday. I have a video coming out soon. I'm working on

1544
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:07,280
it's a waste. It's a project that's a lot smaller in scope than some of my last crash retrieval

1545
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,680
videos will probably be a bit shorter. But I, I'm going to tell you guys, this would have been one

1546
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:17,040
of the most fun researches I've done since offworld technologies division. And I promise you this

1547
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:22,960
will be a brand new thing for probably 99.99% of people. And this is going to be really fun to

1548
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:28,800
talk about. So again, guys, thank you so much for joining. And I shall catch everybody on the next

1549
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:30,480
show. Peace, everybody.
