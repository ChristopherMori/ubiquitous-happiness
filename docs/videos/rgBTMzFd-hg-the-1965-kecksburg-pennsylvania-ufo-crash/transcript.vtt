WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

00:02.900 --> 00:08.140
The 20th century of the United States saw several now infamous alleged UFO crash cases

00:08.140 --> 00:13.180
that feature rich paper trails, a wealth of witnesses, and endless mystery.

00:13.180 --> 00:18.260
Today we travel to the Midwest of the continental United States to a sleepy town in Pennsylvania

00:18.260 --> 00:19.740
named Kecksburg.

00:19.740 --> 00:25.620
We're on the evening of December 9th, 1965, something from the sky crashed into the nearby

00:25.620 --> 00:31.840
woods, sending the town and the U.S. military into a frenzy, leading to one of the most

00:31.840 --> 00:36.740
discussed and debated UFO crash retrieval cases of all time.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.420
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb.

00:38.420 --> 00:44.880
Today we finally visit one of my most requested crash retrieval cases, the 1965 Kecksburg

00:44.880 --> 00:47.100
Pennsylvania UFO crash.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.380
Kecksburg has long been a favorite case in life due to the exhausting lists of local

00:51.380 --> 00:56.660
witnesses, extensive press coverage, and fascinating ties to Blue Book and Project

00:56.660 --> 00:57.660
Moondust.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.220
What, if anything, crashed into the woods that cold winter evening.

01:02.220 --> 01:07.540
Was it a meteor as Blue Book claimed, a Soviet satellite like many debunkers have claimed,

01:07.540 --> 01:13.540
or indeed a craft of non-human intelligence as described by numerous eyewitnesses?

01:13.540 --> 01:18.180
In a quick note here guys, excellent research has been conducted by respected ufologists

01:18.180 --> 01:19.380
on this case.

01:19.380 --> 01:23.260
I will primarily be referencing the work of the most seasoned Kecksburg investigator

01:23.260 --> 01:28.380
Stan Gordon and the legend with whom Gordon shared much of his research and witnesses,

01:28.380 --> 01:34.420
Leonard Stringfield.

01:34.420 --> 01:40.580
In the early evening of December 9th, 1965, thousands of residents across Michigan, Indiana,

01:40.580 --> 01:46.220
Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada observed a fiery brilliant glow

01:46.220 --> 01:51.580
streak across the sky, a ball of fire leaving a smoke trail, estimated to be visible for

01:51.580 --> 01:54.940
20 minutes after the passing of the object.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.980
Numerous ground-based civilians and pilots initially thought the object to be an aircraft

01:58.980 --> 02:03.620
in peril, especially due to pieces of the object seemingly detaching and falling over

02:03.620 --> 02:06.460
Lapeer, Michigan, and Alleria, Ohio.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.780
The material would later be recognized and studied within the official Blue Book report

02:10.780 --> 02:12.060
on Kecksburg.

02:12.060 --> 02:17.380
As noted by Clark McClelland, UFO researcher and former NASA Apollo space program member,

02:17.380 --> 02:22.860
as well as Dr. Paul Anir, professor of astronomy, the object would make a change of course roughly

02:22.860 --> 02:26.900
25 degrees when traveling over Alleria, Ohio.

02:26.900 --> 02:31.380
Similar calculations showed the object to be between 40 and 60 miles in altitude when

02:31.380 --> 02:33.340
first observed over Michigan.

02:33.340 --> 02:37.860
McClelland estimated the speed of the glowing object based on the distance of witness observations

02:37.860 --> 02:43.260
to be traveling at roughly 17 miles per minute or 1,062 miles per hour.

02:43.260 --> 02:50.500
For reference, meteors traveled between 25 and 144,000 miles an hour, so even if McClelland's

02:50.500 --> 02:55.940
calculations were off by a factor of 10, the object was still traveling at much slower

02:55.940 --> 02:59.140
speeds than a meteor in Earth's atmosphere.

02:59.140 --> 03:04.740
Around 4.45 pm, the object plunged into the woods of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.

03:04.740 --> 03:09.820
The object made a turn between Greensburg and La Trobe and was reported from local communities

03:09.820 --> 03:11.760
as it moved towards the south.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.980
Near Laurelville, the object turned again and began to track northeast towards the Kecksburg

03:15.980 --> 03:19.300
area where it reportedly impacted into the woods.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.340
Closely tracking the object, Project Blue Book dispatched a three-man Air Force team

03:23.340 --> 03:29.940
from the 662nd Radar Squadron at the Oakdale Army installation near Pittsburgh to investigate.

03:29.940 --> 03:34.500
The squadron was operating under control of the Aerospace Defense Command.

03:34.500 --> 03:39.060
These orders were presumably given by Major Hector Quintanilla, who took the reins of Blue

03:39.060 --> 03:41.060
Book in 1963.

03:41.060 --> 03:45.520
The 33-page report on Kecksburg from Blue Book has Quintanilla's name all over the

03:45.520 --> 03:50.940
memorandum for record, and it is important to note of Blue Book's conclusion of Kecksburg.

03:50.940 --> 03:54.460
Under the major, the case was designated as a meteor.

03:54.460 --> 03:59.340
And quickly worth mentioning, Blue Book states the three-man team found no materials at the

03:59.340 --> 04:00.340
crash site.

04:00.500 --> 04:04.300
Blue Book curiously marks this case under ACME, Pennsylvania.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.780
Why is this?

04:05.780 --> 04:09.520
Researchers are not sure, but one possibility is the Air Force personnel interviewed witnesses

04:09.520 --> 04:12.340
who lived nearby in the town of ACME.

04:12.340 --> 04:17.420
And speaking of Quintanilla, let's pay special attention to April 5, 1966, where the United

04:17.420 --> 04:22.020
States Air Force Major lied before the House Armed Services Committee, stating that Blue

04:22.020 --> 04:25.460
Book had no radar cases that were unexplained.

04:25.460 --> 04:29.580
Scientific advisor to Blue Book, J. Allen Heineck, revealed this deception by providing

04:29.580 --> 04:37.340
three such cases, 1951 Goose Bay, 1956 Lakinheath, and 1957 Shrevaport.

04:37.340 --> 04:41.460
Although town residents argue to this day over what crashed in the woods that night,

04:41.460 --> 04:47.180
the town witnesses agree within an hour of the impact military forces swarmed the area

04:47.180 --> 04:52.580
almost as quickly as the arrival of Penn State Police and the Kecksburg Volunteer Fireman.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.900
Twenty-eight years, I'm a fireman here at Kecksburg.

04:55.900 --> 05:02.820
It does me good as a young, old fireman now that now we know that something did happen.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.340
The military was here.

05:05.340 --> 05:09.060
Everybody here is correct in what they've seen and what they heard.

05:09.060 --> 05:14.820
I think because of the lay of the land and the terrain, there was different points of

05:14.820 --> 05:20.500
vision from wherever they were at that point.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.660
The outcome of our town meeting, a majority consensus that something big did happen in

05:24.660 --> 05:30.580
Kecksburg on December 9th, 1965, and that despite the official report to the contrary,

05:30.580 --> 05:32.060
soldiers were on site.

05:32.060 --> 05:36.420
Regardless of USAF and Blue Book denying a presence of more than three men at Kecksburg,

05:36.420 --> 05:41.060
a statement that will later be contradicted by Dr. Eric A. Walker, Kecksburg residents

05:41.060 --> 05:47.460
gave descriptions of multiple types of military men, US Army soldiers equipped with M1 rifles,

05:47.460 --> 05:52.820
USAF personnel with blue fatigues and blue berets, and men in civilian clothing seemingly

05:52.820 --> 05:58.140
barking out orders and some witnesses even described men in hazmat suits labelling them

05:58.140 --> 06:00.020
as moon suits.

06:00.020 --> 06:04.380
There are also myriad local press articles like these from the Pittsburgh Press on December

06:04.380 --> 06:09.220
10th that also contradict the military's denial of a presence at Kecksburg.

06:09.220 --> 06:14.340
The description of Air Force men may be paramount to investigating this crash recovery case.

06:14.460 --> 06:19.980
Referred to as blue berets, Leonard Stringfield made numerous mentions to a UFO crash recovery

06:19.980 --> 06:25.420
intelligence team stemming from the Air Force donned in blue fatigues and blue berets.

06:25.420 --> 06:30.140
In crash retrievals of the third kind, a case study of alleged UFOs and occupants in military

06:30.140 --> 06:31.140
custody.

06:31.140 --> 06:35.580
Stringfield stated he had been made aware from other military forces of a rapid reaction

06:35.580 --> 06:41.220
special forces unit named blue berets who can quote, operate secretly and effectively

06:41.220 --> 06:45.540
by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference, end quote.

06:45.540 --> 06:50.500
This unit was housed at certain military bases as rapid reaction units in a constant state

06:50.500 --> 06:54.460
of ready to address downed or crashed UFOs.

06:54.460 --> 06:58.220
Stringfield even stated to have met a former member of the elite blue berets when visiting

06:58.220 --> 07:01.660
the University of Dade City, Florida for a lecture quote.

07:01.660 --> 07:06.040
We talked about the elite force, its makeup and functions and some of his experiences

07:06.040 --> 07:08.740
in Vietnam behind enemy lines.

07:08.740 --> 07:12.820
Although he had never participated in a UFO crash retrieval, he was aware that one of

07:12.820 --> 07:15.740
his fellow members had the experience.

07:15.740 --> 07:20.220
Details were scanty, but Cameron calls that his friend referred to his participation in

07:20.220 --> 07:24.780
the recovery of a quote unquote big head from an alien craft and quote.

07:24.780 --> 07:29.820
In UFO crash retrieval status report for fatal encounters at Fort Dix, McGuire Stringfield

07:29.820 --> 07:34.580
met with a man named Jeff Morse who claimed to be a former blue beret.

07:34.580 --> 07:39.940
Morse would tell Stringfield in 1985 to 1987 about an incident at Fort McGuire Air Force

07:39.940 --> 07:44.940
Base in which a non-human entity was shot to death by US forces.

07:44.940 --> 07:49.220
Quite a bit to discuss about the blue berets, so maybe we will save that for another video.

07:49.220 --> 07:53.060
But I do want to mention Air Force blue berets were made famous with the creation of the

07:53.060 --> 08:00.380
USAF 1041 security police squadron, which operated during 1965 to 1967.

08:00.380 --> 08:06.140
The 1041s and their blue berets were implemented in Operation Safe Side in which the Air Force

08:06.140 --> 08:12.440
deployed a highly trained unit of combat security police known as active defense to repel raids

08:12.440 --> 08:14.480
on air bases in Vietnam.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.420
But the origins of USAF personnel and blue fatigues and blue berets can be traced back

08:18.420 --> 08:23.780
to 1956 with the creation of the strategic air command elite guard under General Curtis

08:23.780 --> 08:27.140
LeMay, who I've spoken about many times.

08:27.140 --> 08:33.580
The SAC elite guards operated as air police from 1956 to 1966 within the time of our Kecksburg

08:33.580 --> 08:37.860
case, serving as part of the US Air Force and US Department of Defense.

08:37.860 --> 08:42.180
The blue beret SAC elite guard were tasked with providing security at headquarters of

08:42.180 --> 08:44.900
strategic air command of the US Air Force.

08:44.900 --> 08:49.180
One such SAC base is Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.420
Remember the mention of this base as we will later discuss a witness who claimed to have

08:52.420 --> 08:56.780
briefly guarded the crashed UAP from Kecksburg at Lockburn AFB.

08:56.780 --> 09:00.700
Let's get back to Kecksburg and analyze the events around the time of an object crashing

09:00.700 --> 09:01.940
in the woods.

09:01.940 --> 09:06.940
With news media starting to swirl about stories of a fireball crashing in the area, local

09:06.940 --> 09:12.620
news director John Murphy out of WHJB Greensburg, Pennsylvania received a call from a startled

09:12.620 --> 09:17.340
mother who claimed she and her children had observed a fiery object fall into the woods

09:17.340 --> 09:20.860
where a cloud of blue smoke began rising after impact.

09:48.340 --> 09:53.380
Murphy, a key player in this story moving forward, arrived to the woods and investigated

09:53.380 --> 09:59.020
the scene for some time before Carl Metz, a state police fire marshal, and another investigator

09:59.020 --> 10:00.740
arrived to the scene.

10:00.740 --> 10:05.180
The two investigators entered the woods and upon returning and being questioned by Murphy,

10:05.180 --> 10:10.140
told Murphy, quote, you better get your information from the army, end quote.

10:10.140 --> 10:14.820
Murphy would then arrive to the state police barracks in Greensburg for more information,

10:14.820 --> 10:18.420
where he observed army and Air Force men swarming the location.

10:44.820 --> 11:08.340
Murphy would interview many town residents about what they saw and experienced in Kecksburg

11:08.340 --> 11:13.220
the evening of December 9th, and excitedly pieced together a radio documentary titled

11:13.220 --> 11:14.900
Object in the Woods.

11:14.900 --> 11:19.660
Curiously, Murphy's wife and other WHJB employees would state Murphy was approached

11:19.660 --> 11:23.940
by men at the station leading to a radical alteration of his program.

11:23.940 --> 11:28.700
Murphy would broadcast a heavily censored version of his documentary, starting the event

11:28.700 --> 11:30.260
with an odd disclaimer.

11:43.220 --> 11:57.100
And state that many witnesses whose testimony had been taped no longer wish to air their

11:57.100 --> 12:14.460
statements due to fear of reprisals from the U.S. Army.

12:14.460 --> 12:43.140
Stan Gordon would even go so far as to state he had received notarized documents from station

12:43.140 --> 12:48.980
employees, claiming USG elements were confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts and were

12:48.980 --> 12:52.540
not allowing said account to be broadcasted.

12:52.540 --> 12:56.820
John Murphy would tragically die in a hit and run incident shortly after the event,

12:56.820 --> 13:00.660
and never claimed publicly to have entered the woods and to have seen what crashed in

13:00.660 --> 13:01.980
Kecksburg.

13:01.980 --> 13:06.580
But in 2003, John's wife claimed he had told her of entering the woods and witnessed

13:06.580 --> 13:09.780
a strange metallic object on the ground.

13:09.780 --> 13:14.620
What was this object observed by so many and that later witnesses would state was transported

13:14.620 --> 13:19.660
out of the woods in the early morning of December 10th by army trucks covered by a tarp.

13:19.660 --> 13:29.180
Fortunately, we have numerous witness testimony to analyze.

13:29.180 --> 13:34.020
There was no tail section, there was no motors, there was no windows, there was no doors.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.700
There was big enough for a grown person to stand up in.

13:36.700 --> 13:41.780
It had like Egyptian writing, like backwards writing on it, stars and circles and dashes

13:41.780 --> 13:43.420
and lines and things like that.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.620
It looked like an acorn.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.620
It was really weird.

13:46.620 --> 13:51.380
A first hand witness questioned at length by both Stan Gordon and Leonard Stringfield

13:51.380 --> 13:55.420
is James, often referred to as Jim Romansky.

13:55.420 --> 13:59.660
Romansky served as a volunteer fireman whose company was dispatched to Kecksburg to assist

13:59.660 --> 14:03.580
with the search of what was thought to be a downed aircraft.

14:04.060 --> 14:07.900
Romansky first approached Gordon in 1987 to tell his story.

14:07.900 --> 14:12.780
He had previously feared ridicule for years, but wanted to finally give his testimony.

14:12.780 --> 14:18.100
On the night of 1965, with the search teams combing the woods, Romansky heard via walkie

14:18.100 --> 14:21.100
talkie the crash site had been discovered.

14:21.100 --> 14:26.060
Upon arriving to the scene, the fireman witnessed an object half buried in the ground.

14:26.060 --> 14:30.580
This object appeared to have descended into the forest at a 30 degree angle, breaking

14:30.580 --> 14:35.140
tree limbs before impacting the ground and leaving a 25 foot long trench.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.540
There were no signs of fire in the area.

14:37.540 --> 14:42.260
I want you to describe what you saw when you arrived in this field where the supposed downed

14:42.260 --> 14:43.260
aircraft was.

14:43.260 --> 14:49.860
Well, first of all, we were in a field hunting for it as downed aircraft and the first rescue

14:49.860 --> 14:54.140
team already found it and radioed into the fire hall, gave the coordinates and it was

14:54.140 --> 14:57.340
down in front of us and we high-tailed it out of our search area and went down into

14:57.340 --> 14:58.340
there.

14:58.340 --> 15:07.660
And we got there expecting a smashed up airplane, wings, fuselage, etc., no such character.

15:07.660 --> 15:11.460
Came down into the woods and here's its humongous piece of metal laying there.

15:11.460 --> 15:18.100
I mean this thing, I've described time and time again as a very large, egg-corn shaped

15:18.100 --> 15:19.860
object.

15:19.860 --> 15:24.380
The front of it, or I presume was the front of it, was pushed down into the dirt where

15:24.380 --> 15:28.060
the way it came in and landed after it took out the top of the trees and brush and everything

15:28.060 --> 15:29.940
coming in.

15:29.940 --> 15:36.220
Came back in an oblong shape, around the bottom was what I call a bumper and then the bottom

15:36.220 --> 15:39.340
was perfectly flat, no signs of propulsion or anything.

15:39.340 --> 15:44.100
There was no doors, no windows, there was no ways of getting in this thing, at least

15:44.100 --> 15:45.500
none that I've seen.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.980
There was no seams on it, no rivets, nothing.

15:48.980 --> 15:52.340
The only thing I've seen was this bumper around it and had these real strange markings

15:52.340 --> 16:00.340
on it which I've often referred to as similar to the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

16:00.340 --> 16:07.260
So as a volunteer fireman we did what we were supposed to do, find the crash site, do a preliminary

16:07.260 --> 16:11.020
investigation for survivors who treated anybody which we didn't because there was none that

16:11.020 --> 16:12.020
we could see.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.180
There was no way of getting into this object.

16:14.180 --> 16:19.180
The object appeared to be a large metallic acorn or bell measuring 10 to 12 feet in length,

16:19.180 --> 16:21.100
8 to 10 feet in diameter.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.780
The raised ring area measured about 8 to 10 inches wide.

16:24.780 --> 16:29.820
The wingless, seamless and rivetless object was described as Romansky as a bronze off

16:29.820 --> 16:31.340
gold color.

16:31.340 --> 16:35.700
As a seasoned machinist, Romansky stated the object almost looked like it had been made

16:35.700 --> 16:41.300
from a liquid metal mold and told researcher Stan Gordon, quote, never in my life have

16:41.300 --> 16:45.540
I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form, end quote.

16:45.540 --> 16:49.220
The presence of the described hieroglyphic writing has been a point of contention for

16:49.220 --> 16:50.700
the Kecksburg case.

16:50.700 --> 16:54.980
With some believing the object to be a Soviet space capsule and the writing to be Russian

16:54.980 --> 16:59.420
Cyrillic, Romansky described the writing as quote, characters of broken and straight

16:59.420 --> 17:02.940
lines, dots, rectangles and circles, end quote.

17:02.940 --> 17:07.100
Romansky would even explicitly state to Leonard Stringfield, he was familiar with the Russian

17:07.100 --> 17:10.820
language and the markings he observed were not Russian.

17:10.820 --> 17:19.300
My dad is originally from Kiev and I went to him one time and I said, dad, I says you

17:19.300 --> 17:23.620
could read and write Polish and Russian, he says, yeah, I said, write me something in

17:23.620 --> 17:24.620
both dialects.

17:24.620 --> 17:25.620
He says, what?

17:25.620 --> 17:26.980
I said, just write me anything.

17:26.980 --> 17:32.420
The Polish and Russian writing that I seen doesn't come nowhere near.

17:32.420 --> 17:37.980
I think it imperative to include much of Jim's testimony on the 1993 Montell-William show

17:37.980 --> 17:43.100
due to his fiery and passionate demeanor and discussion of how his presence at the Kecksburg

17:43.100 --> 17:47.460
case affected his children's time in the U.S. armed services.

17:47.460 --> 17:52.020
The first team had already radioed in his position, were there 10, 15 minutes all talking

17:52.020 --> 17:57.500
around doing a preliminary search, wondering what we discovered.

17:57.500 --> 18:04.140
Two gentlemen come down through the woods, trench coats on, ramrod stiff, crew cut, alright,

18:04.140 --> 18:05.500
this is a restricted area.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.500
You're not ordered to get out of here, oh wait a minute, I'm a civilian.

18:08.500 --> 18:14.100
You ain't going to order me nothing, but as a fireman I'm being relieved from what I'm

18:14.100 --> 18:15.100
doing.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.100
So I got out of there.

18:16.340 --> 18:21.060
We're going out through the woods, we didn't go no more to 15, 20 feet, and I know from

18:21.060 --> 18:27.060
me to you, here come the military, full uniforms, equipment, marching right down through the

18:27.060 --> 18:28.060
woods with a flashlight.

18:28.060 --> 18:31.940
This is December, late in the evening, it's cold, it's wet.

18:31.940 --> 18:34.740
How far away were you from a military base?

18:34.740 --> 18:39.740
Well, the closest base that I knew of was Pittsburgh, which is approximately 45 miles

18:39.740 --> 18:40.740
to the west.

18:40.740 --> 18:45.060
So, within 15 minutes of your arrival at the site, the military was there.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.060
You got it.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.860
Okay, alright, alright, now what did they say to you after this happened?

18:48.860 --> 18:52.060
I mean, I know there were several members, the report I saw on Unsolved Mysteries, several

18:52.060 --> 18:55.740
members of the community were there, right, other people were part of the community were

18:55.740 --> 18:58.660
there and present and were all told to leave.

18:58.660 --> 19:03.420
There was no press or media at the immediate crash site.

19:03.420 --> 19:09.300
What I didn't know up on top of the hill, because I'd come in through the side, the

19:09.300 --> 19:15.060
military had taken over a farmhouse, I mean from what I understand, military brass.

19:15.060 --> 19:22.060
They took over up there, did all their orders and whatever they were doing from up there

19:22.060 --> 19:27.540
and that's where I presume that the military who came down through the woods came from

19:27.540 --> 19:32.060
because when we went out, we had to walk back to the fire hall, which was approximately

19:32.060 --> 19:37.460
the way we had to go, I'd say a good mile, but by the time we got back to the fire hall,

19:37.460 --> 19:41.940
it was wall to wall military, I mean there was trucks and jeeps and cars, there was guards

19:41.940 --> 19:42.940
on the door.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.420
Anybody said to you, I don't want you talking about this, don't say a word about this or

19:46.420 --> 19:53.460
what they did, what they did, I mean these people virtually told us just to shut up,

19:53.460 --> 19:55.660
get to your vehicles and be quiet.

19:55.660 --> 20:00.500
I have a daughter and a son that both went into the military, within the last two or

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
three years.

20:01.500 --> 20:05.220
One went into the Marine Corps, one went into U.S. Air Force.

20:05.220 --> 20:09.500
My daughter come to me from the United States Marine Corps and she said, Dad, your name

20:09.500 --> 20:13.540
can come up on a computer as my father, I had to sign a statement saying I would never

20:13.540 --> 20:19.220
ask a request for any information from Kecksburg, my son had to sign two statements.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.220
About you, about yourself?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.220
Pardon?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.420
Any information about yourself?

20:23.420 --> 20:26.260
Your daughter had to sign a paper that says she would not ask for any information about

20:26.260 --> 20:27.260
you?

20:27.260 --> 20:31.220
Not about me, but about Kecksburg, because my name would come up as her father.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.220
Okay, but you know what?

20:32.220 --> 20:37.860
Then, no wait a minute Montel, then my son in the U.S. Air Force had to sign two papers.

20:37.860 --> 20:41.340
Jim, wait, get to, just jump to the chase, because part of the chase here is the fact

20:41.340 --> 20:44.340
that I spent, I'm telling you, I had some of the highest clearances this country has

20:44.340 --> 20:45.340
to offer.

20:45.340 --> 20:49.540
I've been through files on top of files on top of files, I still ain't seen nothing

20:49.540 --> 20:50.540
yet.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.540
Period.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.540
Period.

20:52.540 --> 20:53.540
Period.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.540
You didn't have the need to know.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.540
Yeah, but that's also not true.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.660
Now my son goes in the Air Force and they tell him he can't even request to go to Wright

20:58.660 --> 21:03.980
Patterson Air Force base for duty, because I seen something and that's where my UFO was

21:03.980 --> 21:04.980
sent today.

21:04.980 --> 21:08.900
Maybe his M.O.S. was something that they didn't have a qualification for it, right

21:08.900 --> 21:09.900
pattern.

21:09.900 --> 21:10.900
His M.O.S. has nothing to do with it.

21:10.900 --> 21:11.900
Okay, all right, hold on a minute.

21:11.900 --> 21:15.180
The government is covering this up, they don't want no one to know, they don't want no one

21:15.180 --> 21:19.980
to get access to anything, because they're afraid people will find out the truth.

21:19.980 --> 21:24.300
During his time spent with Stan Gordon, Romansky would take the researcher to the exact site

21:24.300 --> 21:25.620
of the crash.

21:25.620 --> 21:30.900
This site would line up identically to the description of our next witness, Bill Bullybush,

21:30.900 --> 21:35.020
due to the best of our knowledge had no interaction with Romansky.

21:35.020 --> 21:40.300
Bill Bullybush was driving his car in the afternoon of December 9th, 1965, where he observed

21:40.300 --> 21:42.980
the object streaking over the sky.

21:42.980 --> 21:47.300
Bill stated, quote, the object appeared to hesitate over the Loraville area, then made

21:47.300 --> 21:51.580
a turn and then began to travel northeast towards Kecksburg, end quote, where he then

21:51.580 --> 21:53.420
saw it descending.

21:53.420 --> 21:57.020
Witnessing the object's descent, Bill turned his car and went to the top of the hill now

21:57.020 --> 22:01.900
called Meteor Road, where he observed blue lights flashing in the woods.

22:01.900 --> 22:06.180
As the sky was getting dark, Bullybush claimed to walk into the woods to the crash site, where

22:06.180 --> 22:10.940
he looked upon a metallic acorn shaped object embedded into the soil.

22:10.940 --> 22:16.460
The object featured the same strange writing noticed by Romansky, and Bullybush noted blue

22:16.460 --> 22:29.940
arcing light emanating from the object at intervals.

22:29.940 --> 22:35.940
Bullybush's description of the object supports the theory that it was probably not a meteorite.

22:35.940 --> 22:41.460
I was working on a 64 Corvair at home.

22:41.460 --> 22:48.980
I happened to see this red ball of fire going across, get come up and went towards the mountain,

22:48.980 --> 22:51.500
just like if it was radio controlled.

22:51.500 --> 22:57.300
It made a figure eight, and it came right down in here, and Bully landed right in here,

22:57.300 --> 23:00.660
knocked the top of the trees out.

23:00.660 --> 23:03.260
It stunk like rotten eggs.

23:03.260 --> 23:04.260
You could smell it.

23:04.740 --> 23:09.260
And then just like sizzling and like sparks coming, just like if it was cooling off, it

23:09.260 --> 23:10.580
was red hot.

23:10.580 --> 23:14.540
Bullybush is the only witness I'm aware of to describe the presence of a smell.

23:14.540 --> 23:19.460
The description of a strong smell, in this case rotten eggs, a.k.a. a sulfuric smell,

23:19.460 --> 23:24.740
reminds me closely of the strong ammonia smell witnesses described in the 1997 Virginia

23:24.740 --> 23:25.740
Brazil case.

23:25.740 --> 23:30.500
Bill Bullybush, who fled the woods when he heard the fireman approaching, independently

23:30.500 --> 23:33.380
described a nearly identical object.

23:33.380 --> 23:34.740
I could see it.

23:34.740 --> 23:35.740
Pretty good.

23:35.740 --> 23:41.700
There was no welding, no windows, no nothing on it, and none on the back was a ring, and

23:41.700 --> 23:46.860
it had like Egyptian writing on it, and I couldn't figure out what it was.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.340
From his statements, we can piece together, Bullybush left the scene upon the arrival

23:50.340 --> 23:54.700
of the fire crew, who witnessed the object for a span of 15 minutes until the men described

23:54.700 --> 23:57.500
by Romansky ordered the fireman to leave.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.620
And we do have a witness who states he observed the craft and retrieval crew departing the

24:01.620 --> 24:02.620
woods.

24:02.620 --> 24:07.940
In the early 1990s, I witnessed Jerry Betters, a Pittsburgh jazz musician, came forward with

24:07.940 --> 24:09.340
his testimony.

24:09.340 --> 24:15.940
At 41 years old in 1965, Betters lived near the area of Kecksburg in a town called Murrisville.

24:15.940 --> 24:20.620
Jerry noticed the now infamous fireball, which agitated the horses he was feeding and surrounding

24:20.620 --> 24:22.060
dogs.

24:22.060 --> 24:26.340
Upon hearing the news report of the object crashing in Kecksburg, Jerry phoned his friends

24:26.340 --> 24:29.820
to pick him up and head to the town for a look.

24:29.820 --> 24:32.820
Later with the area, the men found themselves on a private lane.

24:32.820 --> 24:37.420
After rounding a slight turn, Jerry stated he was halted by a military roadblock.

24:37.420 --> 24:42.180
The soldiers halting traffic appeared to wear army fatigues with cloth berets, but other

24:42.180 --> 24:47.300
soldiers equipped with rifles and helmets stood at attention behind the roadblock.

24:47.300 --> 24:52.060
Betters noticed a number of quote unquote military brass officers, well-dressed civilians,

24:52.060 --> 24:56.140
and scattered army star emblazoned jeeps and personnel trucks.

24:56.140 --> 24:59.860
Jerry's attention was commanded towards a large cab and flatbed trailer.

24:59.860 --> 25:04.700
He noticed a domed or acorn-shaped object that was uncovered and being hauled away from

25:04.700 --> 25:05.700
the woods.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.780
Quickly, a tarp was placed over the object.

25:08.780 --> 25:12.380
Betters noted the truck seemed to have trouble traversing up through the field.

25:12.380 --> 25:17.140
Jerry Betters also described the truck and his encounter in a notarized document.

25:42.380 --> 26:10.780
We

26:10.780 --> 26:15.580
do have other witnesses who claim to have been held at gunpoint by the attending military

26:15.580 --> 26:16.580
forces.

26:16.580 --> 26:45.060
The individual is local resident David Newhouse.

26:45.060 --> 26:58.540
In fact, there are dozens of witness testimony from Kecksburg locals and nearby citizens

26:58.540 --> 27:00.880
we could analyze all day.

27:00.880 --> 27:05.600
Like that of then teenager Bill Weaver, who noticed four men exit a light-colored box

27:05.600 --> 27:11.060
truck dressed in quote unquote moon suits and head towards the crash area, or then 14-year-old

27:11.060 --> 27:16.220
Mike Slater, who stated an army officer told Mike and his friend they could do a great

27:16.220 --> 27:21.420
service to their country by sending curious crash seekers wrong directions.

27:21.420 --> 27:26.180
We even have witnesses who state they observed the craft after it was taken out of the field,

27:26.180 --> 27:32.900
and we will address these shortly.

27:32.900 --> 27:38.020
A bell-shaped craft big enough to fit a man with strange hieroglyphic writing was described

27:38.020 --> 27:42.700
by many civilian witnesses the night of December 9th, 1965.

27:42.700 --> 27:46.380
It is interesting how Blue Book contended the object was a meteor and that nothing was

27:46.380 --> 27:51.740
found at the crash site after all of the witness testimony and trajectory and speed calculations

27:51.740 --> 27:56.780
conducted while the object was in the air that are not consistent with meteor travel.

27:56.780 --> 28:01.100
As mentioned earlier, Blue Book did receive some fragmented material that was seen to

28:01.100 --> 28:05.180
fall off of the craft, sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

28:05.300 --> 28:09.940
Blue Book declared this material as chaff, which is quote, material dropped by aircraft

28:09.940 --> 28:15.300
to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises, end quote.

28:15.300 --> 28:19.820
The conclusion of a meteor with presence of this said chaff leads to further inconsistencies

28:19.820 --> 28:21.740
in Blue Book's reporting.

28:21.740 --> 28:25.700
Early skeptics of Kecksburg stated the craft may have been the remains of Soviet spacecraft

28:25.700 --> 28:27.300
Cosmos 96.

28:27.300 --> 28:33.020
This conclusion was not supported in a 1965 NASA press release, which stated Cosmos 96

28:33.020 --> 28:38.180
had decayed and landed in Canada roughly 13 hours prior to the Kecksburg event.

28:38.180 --> 28:43.260
This NASA briefing says, quote, other analyses of the spacecraft orbit definitively indicate

28:43.260 --> 28:47.260
it could not have been the Cosmos 96 spacecraft, end quote.

28:47.260 --> 28:51.660
Stan Gordon further concluded the Kecksburg event was not the result of Cosmos 96 when

28:51.660 --> 28:55.700
he received documents through FOIA requests from both the U.S. Space Command and Naval

28:55.700 --> 29:01.220
Surveillance Center, which verified Cosmos 96 entered the atmosphere at roughly 3.18

29:02.020 --> 29:06.380
Eastern Standard Time over Canada on December 9, 1965.

29:06.380 --> 29:10.940
Some such as NASA mission specialist James Oberg maintained the object was a capsule

29:10.940 --> 29:14.620
of Soviet origin recovered in secrecy for its heat shielding.

29:14.620 --> 29:19.700
Joining us now from Houston is spaceflight engineer and author James Oberg, who has studied

29:19.700 --> 29:24.140
the reported sighting in Kecksburg and has his own theory about what landed there in

29:24.140 --> 29:26.140
1965.

29:26.220 --> 29:32.340
Mr. Oberg, first of all, do you believe that something crashed in Kecksburg in 1965 and

29:32.340 --> 29:34.180
was it a UFO?

29:34.180 --> 29:37.820
If it's anything, it might be something a lot more Earth-like.

29:37.820 --> 29:41.020
It might be a spacecraft from Russia and not from Mars.

29:41.020 --> 29:45.700
It turns out we do know that a Russian probe fell back to Earth that day, and it was a

29:45.700 --> 29:46.860
special kind of probe.

29:46.860 --> 29:49.020
It was one of their probes to the planet Venus.

29:49.020 --> 29:52.740
It failed, was trapped in Earth orbit, and eventually fell out of orbit.

29:52.740 --> 29:56.940
What might have been on that Russian space probe that the U.S. would have been so interested

29:56.940 --> 29:57.940
in?

29:57.940 --> 30:01.540
Oh, the most important thing about the probe would be the heat shield, how thick it was,

30:01.540 --> 30:05.900
what material it was made out of, how heavy it was, and once we knew that, we could then

30:05.900 --> 30:09.180
analyze how big their warheads would be in their ICBMs.

30:09.180 --> 30:14.580
But in this clip, it is necessary to mention Oberg is still mentioning Cosmos 96.

30:14.580 --> 30:20.100
Others have wondered if the craft was indeed a Gemini or Orion capsule expelled in the area,

30:20.100 --> 30:25.020
such as Assistant Chief of Kecksburg Fire Department Jim Mays, who got within 75 yards

30:25.020 --> 30:27.580
of the object but didn't get a clear view.

30:27.580 --> 30:31.940
But the idea of a man-made space capsule crashing into the Midwest of the continental

30:31.940 --> 30:37.820
United States was further discredited in this May 2000 Leslie Keen conference titled, Combating

30:37.820 --> 30:43.420
Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case.

30:43.420 --> 30:49.100
Some of you may know journalist Leslie Keen as the writer of the 2017 New York Times article

30:49.100 --> 30:54.300
bringing the Pentagon UAP videos and OSAP slash ATIP to the public zeitgeist.

30:54.300 --> 30:59.100
In this conference, Keen discussed her correspondence with Nicholas Johnson, NASA Chief Scientist

30:59.100 --> 31:02.460
for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.

31:02.460 --> 31:07.980
Johnson analyzed the orbital data of the Soviet Venus probe Cosmos 96 and determined the object

31:07.980 --> 31:12.820
could not have landed in Kecksburg near 5 p.m. December 9, 1965.

31:12.820 --> 31:17.620
Furthermore, Johnson stated no man-made space object landed in Pennsylvania on the day of

31:17.620 --> 31:18.620
the crash.

31:18.620 --> 31:23.940
So I was able to contact an important scientist from NASA, probably the leading expert in

31:23.940 --> 31:28.900
the world on this issue and he was named Nicholas Johnson, he's the Chief Scientist for Orbital

31:28.900 --> 31:31.220
Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.

31:31.220 --> 31:36.500
He was able to obtain the coordinates of Cosmos 96 so that he could calculate if part of it

31:36.500 --> 31:40.620
had kept stayed in orbit after the crash that happened that morning, could it have landed

31:40.620 --> 31:45.100
in Pennsylvania and he was able to determine absolutely not, made the statement for us

31:45.100 --> 31:48.540
that it is impossible that that could have been Cosmos 96.

31:48.540 --> 31:53.540
And the more interesting statement he made was that in fact there is no man-made object

31:53.540 --> 31:59.380
that came down over Pennsylvania at 5 o'clock on that day, there's no man-made object and

31:59.380 --> 32:04.260
he said that he has the databases and the knowledge to determine, even if it had been

32:04.260 --> 32:07.140
some kind of secret experiment he would be aware of it.

32:07.140 --> 32:11.980
He was also able to eliminate the project Corona which was a project that was dropping

32:11.980 --> 32:18.260
these canisters, it was sending out these spy satellites to Russia, photographing things

32:18.260 --> 32:23.140
from the sky flying back over the United States and dropping canisters which were then retrieved.

32:23.140 --> 32:26.340
Some people have thought that that might have been what it was, he was also able to eliminate

32:26.340 --> 32:27.340
that.

32:27.340 --> 32:31.340
Keen's work on retrieving official Kecksburg documents is truly fascinating.

32:31.340 --> 32:36.740
In the early 2000s working with the Coalition of Freedom of Information, CFI, Keen took

32:36.740 --> 32:43.460
legal action towards NASA for stonewalling files on Kecksburg and in 2007 she won.

32:43.460 --> 32:48.140
A settlement in October of 2007 required NASA to provide hundreds of never-before-seen

32:48.140 --> 32:52.660
documents to Keen and CFI while paying all legal fees.

32:52.660 --> 32:56.740
NASA's search for documents on the craft was completed by August 2009, where NASA

32:56.740 --> 33:02.820
posted 220 pages of Moondust documents with zero relation to Kecksburg.

33:02.820 --> 33:07.140
According to a NASA Public Affairs document, quote, NASA sent its files to the National

33:07.140 --> 33:10.940
Archives for Safekeeping two years after the Kecksburg incident.

33:10.940 --> 33:16.500
In 1996, the National Archives told NASA that the files had been marked as lost since

33:16.500 --> 33:19.020
1987, end quote.

33:19.020 --> 33:22.500
We won't spend any time on Moondust, but if you have never heard of the program I

33:22.500 --> 33:26.860
highly recommend watching my video on Moondust which covers this program in depth along with

33:26.860 --> 33:32.380
its fellow programs UFO and Blue Fly, tasked with recovering descended foreign space vehicles

33:32.380 --> 33:34.020
during the Cold War.

33:34.020 --> 33:39.520
It is a very strange convenience that files relating to Kecksburg were lost forever.

33:39.520 --> 33:44.500
But let's explore what witnesses like Romansky, Bullybush, Betters, and myriad other witnesses

33:44.500 --> 34:09.240
describe crashing into the woods that cold evening.

34:09.240 --> 34:13.480
Many will remember when I covered this infographics crash retrieval operator video that contained

34:13.480 --> 34:16.260
a fascinating first-hand testimony.

34:16.260 --> 34:22.160
Very rarely do well-known UFO sightings describe a bell or acorn-shaped craft, certainly not

34:22.160 --> 34:26.920
one that is bronze, 10 to 12 feet high with strange writing along the base.

34:26.920 --> 34:31.160
But as it turns out, there are a wealth of similar sightings we can analyze.

34:31.160 --> 34:36.800
Let's take a look at this December 2, 1952 Blue Book case into Quincy, Louisiana, where

34:36.800 --> 34:42.320
multiple eyewitnesses observed an acorn-shaped object emitting pink, green, red, and yellow

34:42.320 --> 34:46.960
lights moving up and down in altitude for a period of two and a half hours.

34:46.960 --> 34:52.240
We can also analyze this November 10, 1956 Blue Book case in Massachusetts, where both

34:52.240 --> 34:57.680
civilian and military sources observed an acorn shape featuring a white base, red side,

34:57.680 --> 34:59.040
and green glow.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.680
Blue Book labeled this case as probably the planet Venus.

35:02.680 --> 35:08.160
On August 23, 1957, Blue Book reported a sighting of a bell-shaped object climb and

35:08.160 --> 35:11.280
move out of eyesight of observers in New Jersey.

35:11.280 --> 35:16.320
The case was explained away as a weather balloon from Philadelphia Municipal Airport.

35:16.320 --> 35:21.600
Around the time of Kecksburg, November 1965 to be exact, residents in Manhattan, New York

35:21.600 --> 35:26.760
reported to Blue Book of a bell-shaped UFO hovering above Manhattan during an electricity

35:26.760 --> 35:28.140
blackout.

35:28.140 --> 35:32.080
There are over half a dozen other Blue Book cases I can reference off the top of my head

35:32.280 --> 35:37.720
like a 7-8 foot bell changing colors in 1965 seen over Bunky, Louisiana.

35:37.720 --> 35:42.360
In the video description, you can find additional Blue Book cases featuring bell or acorn-shaped

35:42.360 --> 35:48.200
UFOs from 1957, 1954, 1965, and 1957.

35:48.200 --> 35:52.280
But I would like to draw your attention to a now-deleted Reddit entry titled, quote,

35:52.280 --> 35:58.240
I worked on a team that dealt with NHI technology and left in 2018, end quote.

35:58.240 --> 36:03.440
This alleged Reddit whistleblower is another in a long line of enigmatic, anonymous individuals

36:03.440 --> 36:08.320
who make astonishing claims on Reddit, 4chan, or other message boards before deleting their

36:08.320 --> 36:14.040
profiles, leaving users debating endlessly to the validity of their entries.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.680
I will save exploring this testimony for a full video as I find this post fascinating,

36:18.680 --> 36:23.240
but to summarize this post, the leaker became disgruntled and sought to vent about his career

36:23.240 --> 36:28.080
within an agency that dealt with issues related to non-human intelligence.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.600
One paragraph of this perplexing post caught my attention, quote,

36:31.600 --> 36:36.360
Later I worked in a facility, within a facility, just like the one I had tried to inspect.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.160
It stored a craft.

36:38.160 --> 36:42.640
Being near the craft for extended periods of time is extremely dangerous, especially if

36:42.640 --> 36:45.000
it is being experimented on with power.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.320
I didn't observe any injuries to anyone while I was there, but all sorts of long-term nasty

36:50.320 --> 36:53.960
injuries were relayed to me through rumors and warnings.

36:53.960 --> 36:57.080
The craft was shaped like a dreidel without the handle.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.840
There was a large exterior piece that went missing when it was recovered.

37:00.840 --> 37:07.600
The theory is it acted as a stabilizer, although some argue it was a crude weapon, end quote.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.560
Before we break this down, the anonymous poster also said, quote,

37:10.560 --> 37:13.200
The shape was directly informed by its purpose.

37:13.200 --> 37:17.080
Every shape is custom-molded in a metallic material that would revolutionize the way

37:17.080 --> 37:19.620
we travel if we had it, end quote.

37:19.620 --> 37:23.720
This method of molding sounds extremely similar to the statements of first-hand Kecksburg

37:23.720 --> 37:35.880
witness and machinist Jim Romansky.

37:35.880 --> 37:40.960
Discussion of peril to human bodies and cognition when in proximity to UAP is being heavily

37:40.960 --> 37:46.840
explored in 2024, and has even been mentioned in a graphic in Lou Elizondo's book Eminent.

37:46.840 --> 37:51.360
The craft description, a dreidel without its handle, sounds almost identical to the craft

37:51.360 --> 37:55.240
Romansky, Bully Bush, Betters, and others described.

37:55.240 --> 38:00.360
The Reddit user also states a large exterior piece went missing when the craft was recovered.

38:00.360 --> 38:05.280
While remember back to our 1965 fireball, witnesses discussed pieces falling off of

38:05.280 --> 38:07.600
the blazing fireball in the sky.

38:07.600 --> 38:11.720
Blue Book even claimed to have retrieved pieces of chaff from the object.

38:11.720 --> 38:17.200
Interesting, I am once again drawn to whistleblower Stephen Lovekin, who claimed a special classified

38:17.200 --> 38:21.480
portion of Blue Book had actually recovered debris from the Roswell wreckage.

38:21.480 --> 38:26.360
Lastly, the writing described as hieroglyphics reminds me of three other cases.

38:26.360 --> 38:31.320
The writing on the Roswell debris described by primary witness Jesse Marcel Sr.

38:31.320 --> 38:36.720
The writing along the lip of a craft craft, Danny Sheehan observed photos of, in the classified

38:36.720 --> 38:40.240
files of Blue Book while under order from President Jimmy Carter.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.640
And the writings that appeared to project off of what was considered recovered weapon technology

38:44.640 --> 38:53.440
by witness RA at the Offworld Technologies Division.

38:53.440 --> 38:58.560
I will discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker only briefly as I have already covered him in my majestic

38:58.560 --> 39:03.280
documents project with Ryan Wood and in my Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the

39:03.280 --> 39:05.400
UFO crash retrieval video.

39:05.400 --> 39:09.920
Robert Sarbacher, physicist and member of the U.S. Joint Research and Development Board

39:09.920 --> 39:15.480
named Dr. Eric A. Walker in an interview with Stanton Freedman, implicating Dr. Walker as

39:15.480 --> 39:21.400
an integral member to UFO crash retrieval and UFO study alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.

39:21.400 --> 39:28.200
Dr. Eric A. Walker was the president of Penn State University from 1956 to 1971, a member

39:28.200 --> 39:32.480
of many defense boards including chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis and the

39:32.480 --> 39:37.520
executive secretary of the Defense Research Board from 1950 to 1951.

39:37.520 --> 39:42.560
Throughout the 1980s, Walker would be contacted by numerous UFO researchers, such as William

39:42.560 --> 39:47.600
Steinman and Habib Henry Asadahel, a pseudonym for Armin Victorian.

39:47.600 --> 39:52.160
Walker would confirm attendance at meetings centered on UFO crash and body retrieval efforts

39:52.160 --> 39:58.920
in 1949 to 1950, discuss the validity of MJ-12, comment on the difficulty of breakthroughs

39:58.920 --> 40:03.680
in UFO reverse engineering and make all sorts of cryptic statements on needing to understand

40:03.680 --> 40:07.040
ESP to become involved with UFO programs.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.960
Let's break down this conversation between Armin Victorian and Walker, where Kecksburg

40:10.960 --> 40:16.160
is referenced, and before we do an interesting note, primary Kecksburg researcher Stan Gordon

40:16.160 --> 40:21.360
did state there was a report of someone fitting Dr. Walker's description at the crash site.

40:21.360 --> 40:25.240
In the interview, Walker states he went to the Kecksburg crash site with two men from

40:25.240 --> 40:27.480
the military that were not on duty.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.600
He also went with a fellow colleague of his.

40:30.600 --> 40:35.360
When asked if it was a UFO recovered, Walker states, quote, I cannot comment on that.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.120
I cannot tell you, end quote.

40:38.120 --> 40:42.160
Walker would not comment on if he was at the crash site for long, but did state he and

40:42.160 --> 40:45.400
the other men did not prepare any reports.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.720
Two men from the military, but not on duty.

40:47.720 --> 40:53.320
So we can rule out here that these were the three USAF Blue Book personnel from the 662nd

40:53.320 --> 40:56.080
radar squadron dispatched to the crash site.

40:56.080 --> 41:00.960
Could Walker and his mentioned off-duty military companions possibly be the men in civilian

41:00.960 --> 41:05.840
clothes referenced by numerous eyewitnesses or possibly the men in trench coats who ordered

41:05.840 --> 41:09.160
Romansky and the firemen away from the UFO?

41:09.160 --> 41:12.960
And we must ask, why did Walker not prepare any reports?

41:12.960 --> 41:18.120
Can we take Walker's refusal to comment on the presence of a UFO as an admission that

41:18.120 --> 41:22.320
non-human technology did in fact crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania?

41:22.320 --> 41:27.040
And last part here, Walker mentions a colleague of his accompanying him to the crash site.

41:27.040 --> 41:32.400
In 1965, Walker was serving as president of Pennsylvania State University, a shadowy

41:32.400 --> 41:34.840
witness I covered and spoke to as TB.

41:34.840 --> 41:39.880
I highly recommend watching my UFO witness list redacted video to analyze his entire

41:39.880 --> 41:40.880
story.

41:40.880 --> 41:46.680
According to alleged emails with Dr. Stephen Greer, TB stated UFO program USAPs, unacknowledged

41:46.680 --> 41:53.120
special access programs, are embedded within UARCs, university affiliated research centers

41:53.120 --> 41:54.960
for the Department of Defense.

41:54.960 --> 42:00.760
As it turns out, Pennsylvania State University does indeed have a UARC, the Applied Research

42:00.760 --> 42:02.960
Laboratory for the US Navy.

42:02.960 --> 42:07.280
In fact, Walker would help create the Applied Research Center at the behest of the US Navy

42:07.280 --> 42:13.160
in 1945 following World War II, where Dr. Walker moved 100 engineers from Harvard to Penn

42:13.160 --> 42:14.360
State.

42:14.360 --> 42:20.720
Not only was this ARL awarded the largest research contract in Penn State history, $2.1 billion

42:20.720 --> 42:21.720
from the Navy.

42:21.800 --> 42:27.720
The ARL also currently specializes in prototyping novel power and energy systems, electrooptics

42:27.720 --> 42:29.400
and directed energy.

42:29.400 --> 42:34.200
Could Walker and his colleague have been tasked with investigating the Kexburg crash for UAP

42:34.200 --> 42:39.880
programs stemming from Penn State University's Affiliated Research Center, the Applied Research

42:39.880 --> 42:41.720
Laboratory?

42:41.720 --> 42:52.520
In his 2024 book Eminent, Lou Elizondo named Lyndon B. Johnson amongst Truman, Eisenhower,

42:52.520 --> 42:58.280
JFK, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Trump, as presidents who were briefed into sum to

42:58.280 --> 43:00.640
all of the UFO phenomenon.

43:00.640 --> 43:05.200
This statement by Elizondo plus his relationship with Dr. Eric Walker, who self-admitted he

43:05.200 --> 43:09.720
was present at the Kexburg crash, leads us to do some serious investigation into Lyndon

43:09.720 --> 43:15.040
B. Johnson, who served in office from 1963 to 1969.

43:15.040 --> 43:21.040
We can see in the luncheon in the White House, dated August 3, 1964, Eric A. Walker amongst

43:21.040 --> 43:24.640
other colleague presidents met with Lyndon B. Johnson.

43:24.640 --> 43:29.040
Walker was also the only university president to be invited by Johnson to attend the Clean

43:29.040 --> 43:33.120
Air Act signing in the White House in 1967.

43:33.120 --> 43:38.040
But we can also find a handful of letters between Walker and Johnson, such as this September

43:38.040 --> 43:43.880
10, 1964 letter in which the president writes Walker thanking him profusely for his service

43:43.880 --> 43:48.240
as a member of the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Military Academy.

43:48.240 --> 43:52.800
Some unreferenced actions recommended by Walker were to be instated by the Secretary of Defense

43:52.800 --> 43:54.520
at Johnson's request.

43:54.520 --> 43:58.920
This report very well may have nothing to do with UAP, but Johnson and Walker were close

43:58.920 --> 44:01.520
enough to exchange personal letters.

44:01.520 --> 44:07.520
Let's also analyze the September 24, 1964 letter addressed to Dr. Walker from Johnson,

44:07.520 --> 44:12.440
Dr. Walker to personally recommend a university student to honor as a young leader.

44:12.440 --> 44:18.120
Or how about this May 18, 1966 letter dated after the Kecksburg incident in which Johnson

44:18.120 --> 44:23.040
again profusely thanks Walker for his service as a member and chairman of the National Science

44:23.040 --> 44:24.200
Board.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.520
One Dr. Hornig is mentioned here, pay attention to that name for later.

44:28.520 --> 44:32.960
In this letter, Lyndon B. Johnson cryptically says, quote, I should also like to thank you

44:32.960 --> 44:37.680
for the unstinting manner in which you served your government in other areas, including

44:37.680 --> 44:41.840
your recent tenure as a board of the Defense Science Board, end quote.

44:41.840 --> 44:46.720
Just how deep was this relationship between the president and a man associated with USG

44:46.720 --> 44:48.720
crash retrieval efforts?

44:48.720 --> 44:53.020
Johnson also had a provable interest in UFOs during his time in the U.S. Senate before

44:53.020 --> 44:54.280
his presidency.

44:54.280 --> 44:59.320
In this article titled, Lyndon B. Johnson Calls for UFO Alert, we can see Johnson attempted

44:59.320 --> 45:05.000
to institute a military subcommittee to report UFO sightings personally to him.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.880
Johnson even wrote to Major Donald Kehoe, an excellent ufologist and author of the Flying

45:09.880 --> 45:16.340
Saucer Conspiracy in 1960 thanking Kehoe for delivering documented evidence on UFOs.

45:16.340 --> 45:21.520
With all of this interest in UFOs and his relationship with the shadowy Dr. Eric Walker,

45:21.520 --> 45:27.280
what was Johnson doing during and after the December 9, 1965 Kecksburg event and how much

45:27.280 --> 45:28.880
did he know?

45:28.880 --> 45:34.080
In his 2024 release of all of his research files, Grant Cameron has supplied incredibly

45:34.080 --> 45:38.960
crucial documents discussing Johnson's actions and meetings around the time of the Kecksburg

45:38.960 --> 45:40.080
crash.

45:40.080 --> 45:46.040
Here we find President Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule for December 9 through the 11, 1965.

45:46.040 --> 45:50.440
Since the time of the Kecksburg event occurred around 4 to 5 p.m. Eastern Standard, we will

45:50.440 --> 45:55.000
begin to analyze late appointments on the 9th and meetings the following day.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.520
The evening of December 9, the President seemed to partake in many leisure activities,

45:59.520 --> 46:04.000
dinner, driving around the Texas White House, watching the evening news, etc.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.280
On the morning of December 10, 9.50 to be exact, solely an hour after waking, we see

46:09.280 --> 46:13.800
a massive roster of guests arrive for an exhausting day of meetings.

46:13.800 --> 46:18.940
The arrivals include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or JCS as I'll refer to them, the Secretary

46:18.940 --> 46:24.880
and Undersecretary of Defense, doctors such as the aforementioned Dr. Donald Hornig,

46:24.880 --> 46:29.720
high-up USG officials, NASA Director James Webb, and more.

46:29.720 --> 46:35.720
While no meetings this day make explicit mention of Kecksburg, Soviet spy satellites or ICBMs,

46:35.720 --> 46:40.200
every single one of these names offer crucial insight and a key piece to the puzzle of the

46:40.200 --> 46:46.360
Kecksburg mystery, and the possibility of a red-in President addressing a pressing UFO

46:46.360 --> 46:47.840
crash retrieval.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.100
Almost immediately upon the guests' arrival, the President began his meetings for over

46:52.100 --> 46:56.460
two hours from 10.10 a.m. to 12.51 p.m.

46:56.460 --> 47:01.580
Johnson met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bill Moyers, Joe Califano, Secretary McNamara,

47:01.580 --> 47:02.820
and Secretary Vance.

47:02.820 --> 47:07.100
There is a lot to break down here as each name warrants investigation.

47:07.100 --> 47:12.900
The Joint Chiefs of Staff include US Navy Admiral Donald L. McDonald, who was in 1965

47:12.900 --> 47:18.100
serving as the Chief of Naval Operations in General Wallace M. Green, commandant of the

47:18.100 --> 47:21.940
US Marine Corps, not much to analyze about these gentlemen.

47:21.940 --> 47:27.180
But during LBJ's presidency, USAF General J. P. McConnell served as Chief of Staff for

47:27.180 --> 47:28.860
the US Air Force.

47:28.860 --> 47:35.660
Upon taking his position on February 1, 1965, he relieved General Curtis LeMay.

47:35.660 --> 47:39.980
If that name sounds familiar, we have discussed LeMay earlier in this video and at length

47:39.980 --> 47:45.020
as the General who denied Senator Barry Goldwater to the Blue Room at Wright-Patterson Air Force

47:45.020 --> 47:50.780
Base, and congratulated Harry B. Cooper for his work on the quote-unquote UFO program.

47:50.780 --> 47:54.300
LeMay's ties to ufology are vast.

47:54.300 --> 47:59.380
Also among the JCS was US Army General Earl Wheeler, who sat as the Chairman for the Joint

47:59.380 --> 48:04.220
Chiefs of Staff, worth noting Wheeler shot to the top of the ranks of the US military

48:04.220 --> 48:09.500
without much combat experience, eliciting criticism from many including none other than

48:09.500 --> 48:14.420
General Curtis LeMay, who called Wheeler quote, Paulie Parrot, end quote.

48:14.420 --> 48:18.820
A small detail worth noting after the meeting all of the Chiefs of Staff took a car ride

48:18.820 --> 48:22.180
with Johnson, all but the under-qualified Wheeler.

48:22.180 --> 48:27.000
The last Chief of Staff present in the early meetings is General Harold K. Johnson, Chief

48:27.000 --> 48:28.980
of Staff for the US Army.

48:28.980 --> 48:33.220
Johnson spearheaded the Eighth Calvary Regiment, which in Vietnam was a component of the First

48:33.220 --> 48:34.700
Calvary Division.

48:34.700 --> 48:38.820
The division I suspected in the Infographics whistleblower video to contain the soldiers

48:38.820 --> 48:41.220
who witnessed the crashed UAP.

48:41.220 --> 48:46.260
These Joint Chiefs of Staff were all overly qualified to be associated with the program

48:46.260 --> 48:50.780
and briefed Johnson on the crashed UFO from the evening before, but this trail goes even

48:50.780 --> 48:51.780
deeper.

48:51.780 --> 48:55.900
As previously mentioned, including in the morning meetings were Bill Moyers, the personal

48:55.900 --> 49:01.220
assistant to Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Deputy Secretary

49:01.220 --> 49:06.300
of Defense Cyrus Vance, and Naval Veteran Special Assistant of the Secretary and Deputy

49:06.300 --> 49:09.380
Secretary of Defense Joe Califano.

49:09.380 --> 49:13.580
Califano would attend many of the meetings with Johnson the day of the 10th, but here

49:13.580 --> 49:18.500
let's make special notice to Califano's duty as a member of the Federal Radiation

49:18.500 --> 49:19.500
Council.

49:19.500 --> 49:24.460
Califano had a history of dealing with aerial collisions and crashes that required the Atomic

49:24.460 --> 49:30.420
Energy Commission's involvement, such as this December 4th and 5th 1965 case of a midair

49:30.420 --> 49:32.020
aircraft collision.

49:32.020 --> 49:36.900
What is interesting to note here is a subsequent off-record meeting with Califano and Buford

49:36.900 --> 49:42.940
Ellington, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning on December 13th, 1965, four days

49:42.940 --> 49:44.300
after Kecksburg.

49:44.300 --> 49:48.620
Why was this off-record meeting sent to Grant Cameron from the Lyndon B. Johnson Library

49:48.620 --> 49:51.740
and Museum considered off-record?

49:51.740 --> 49:56.660
Following the JCS car ride excluding Wheeler, the guests engaged in lunch before Johnson

49:56.660 --> 50:02.620
met with McNamara, Vance, Bill Moyers, and Dr. Donald Hornig, as well as Secretary Orville

50:02.620 --> 50:03.860
Freeman.

50:03.860 --> 50:08.620
Donald Hornig served as Presidential Science Advisor to Johnson after also serving the

50:08.620 --> 50:10.700
late John F. Kennedy Jr.

50:10.700 --> 50:15.940
The Presidential Science Advisor was a position first held by Dr. Vannevar Bush to Franklin

50:15.940 --> 50:18.220
D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.

50:18.220 --> 50:21.580
This should ring a bell to anybody familiar with the majestic documents.

50:21.580 --> 50:26.740
The last member of this post-lunch meeting included Secretary Orville Freeman, U.S. Secretary

50:26.740 --> 50:31.480
of Agriculture under Johnson from 1961 to 1969.

50:31.480 --> 50:36.020
Why would a former Marine and Secretary of Agriculture be present at a meeting with three

50:36.020 --> 50:39.720
Secretaries of Defense and the Science Advisor to the President?

50:39.720 --> 50:44.600
What is even weirder here is the presence of James Webb alongside an Undersecretary

50:44.600 --> 50:45.600
of Agriculture.

50:45.600 --> 50:51.800
I take you to July 9th, 1947, just two days after the Roswell crash, where James Webb,

50:51.800 --> 50:56.200
sitting as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, made late evening calls to Norris

50:56.200 --> 50:59.260
E. Dodd, Undersecretary of Agriculture.

50:59.260 --> 51:03.860
This may very well be a stretch here, but we must pursue all research angles, was Webb

51:03.860 --> 51:08.180
discussing the Roswell event with Dodd and do positions like Secretary of Agriculture

51:08.180 --> 51:11.940
entwine more with UAP programs than we might think.

51:11.940 --> 51:16.220
I won't spend too much more time on the meetings as we have already discussed the significance

51:16.220 --> 51:19.620
of most of the members in their grouping, and I have glossed over some of the other

51:19.620 --> 51:24.540
interesting players like Dr. Glenn Seaborg, who was a Nobel Prize winning chemist and

51:24.540 --> 51:28.620
atomic energy chairman, from 1961 to 1971.

51:28.620 --> 51:33.620
I could make an entire video on the significance of this day of meetings, but the JCS and every

51:33.620 --> 51:38.540
single individual summoned to Johnson's Texas residence the day after Kecksburg holds

51:38.540 --> 51:48.980
massive importance and possibly signifies a day of briefings and meetings on the crash.

51:48.980 --> 51:53.380
To further our investigation of Kecksburg, we can analyze multiple witnesses claiming

51:53.380 --> 51:57.780
to have observed the Kecksburg bell after it was dragged from the woods that cold winter

51:57.780 --> 51:58.780
night.

51:58.780 --> 52:04.460
One such witness contacted Stan Gordon before the airing of a 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast

52:04.460 --> 52:10.020
on Kecksburg and provided detailed information on his experience with the Kecksburg craft.

52:10.020 --> 52:14.260
According to this witness, as a member of the Air Force security team at Lockborn Air

52:14.260 --> 52:19.140
Force Base near Columbus, Ohio, he guarded the object on the early morning of December

52:19.140 --> 52:25.060
10, 1965, after the object had been transported from Pennsylvania.

52:25.060 --> 52:29.140
According to this witness, after arriving on a truck, the craft was backed into a hangar

52:29.140 --> 52:32.380
and security was greatly tightened around the base.

52:32.380 --> 52:37.100
The object whose description matched the 10-12 foot bronze bell apparently stayed at the

52:37.100 --> 52:42.020
base only a short time the morning of the 10th, before being transported to Wright-Patterson

52:42.020 --> 52:44.300
Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.

52:44.300 --> 52:48.340
And we do have witnesses who claim to have observed the bell at Wright-Patt.

52:48.340 --> 52:53.780
This witness, Myron, first contacted Stan Gordon after the airing of the 1990 Unsolved Mysteries

52:53.780 --> 52:59.100
broadcast and was interviewed and investigated by the legendary Leonard Stringfield.

52:59.100 --> 53:03.620
The trucker claimed the only reason he would discuss his experience was due to thinking,

53:03.620 --> 53:08.660
quote, it would be okay to discuss what he saw since it was now on TV, end quote.

53:08.660 --> 53:12.060
The word of Stringfield carries much weight for myself and others.

53:12.060 --> 53:16.420
And regarding Myron, Stringfield stated in UFO crash retrievals, the Inner Sanctum status

53:16.420 --> 53:21.860
reports six, quote, after a number of lengthy interviews and getting his testimony on videotapes

53:21.860 --> 53:27.740
at his home by a medical friend and research associate, Dr. Brian Thompson, I feel convinced

53:27.740 --> 53:30.660
of Myron's sincerity, end quote.

53:30.660 --> 53:33.900
Stringfield's analysis of Kecksburg would remain extremely balanced.

53:33.900 --> 53:38.740
We can take for example Stringfield's discussion of an insider known as Uncle, who spoke to

53:38.740 --> 53:45.500
Stringfield through an intermediary, as noted in 1993 status report three, amassing the evidence.

53:45.500 --> 53:50.860
Uncle told Stringfield he was on the right track with his research but cautioned of disinformation.

53:50.860 --> 53:56.300
Among Uncle statements were claims of understanding alien biological structures, that UFOs were

53:56.300 --> 54:02.220
of benign origin, and that the Kecksburg case involved a crashed spy plane, while the heavily

54:02.220 --> 54:07.260
contested Fort Riley and Johannesburg, South Africa crash cases were true.

54:07.260 --> 54:11.260
All this is to say that Stringfield did in fact note opinions against Kecksburg but

54:11.260 --> 54:14.220
still pursued the case for well over a decade.

54:14.220 --> 54:18.780
Anyways, back to Myron, as noted for the record by Stringfield, Myron stated he and

54:18.780 --> 54:24.380
his cousin, J.S., worked for a family owned shale and tile brick business in Ohio.

54:24.380 --> 54:28.380
Two or three days following the Kecksburg crash, the company was contracted for a large

54:28.380 --> 54:32.420
order of special glazed bricks to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

54:32.420 --> 54:36.900
The customer, the U.S. Navy, according to Myron, sent a representative to the business

54:36.900 --> 54:39.460
to select and inspect the bricks.

54:39.460 --> 54:43.900
Myron claimed receipts of this transaction were lost when the business was sold to new

54:43.900 --> 54:44.900
owners.

54:44.900 --> 54:49.180
The specialty brick in question was a, quote, double glazed engineered brick, end quote.

54:49.180 --> 54:53.260
Myron would later state the purpose of these bricks were to build a double thick, lead

54:53.260 --> 54:58.580
lined protective structure around the Kecksburg UFO to protect against radiation.

54:58.580 --> 55:02.740
The shipment of bricks was delivered at a designated gate where Myron and J.S. arrived

55:02.740 --> 55:04.660
in different flatbed trucks.

55:04.660 --> 55:09.360
Once outside Wright Pat, a two or three star general dressed in a blue uniform led the

55:09.360 --> 55:11.780
delivery men to a warehouse ahead.

55:11.780 --> 55:16.740
The destination for the bricks was a brick warehouse, 50 to 80 feet inside, accessible

55:16.740 --> 55:22.180
by a narrow blacktop driveway surrounded by rows of offices and a power plant.

55:22.180 --> 55:27.740
To quote Myron, nearby the building was a, quote, Army 35 foot long tri-axle lowboy

55:27.740 --> 55:30.100
that I later learned transported the object.

55:30.100 --> 55:33.820
A tarp was still draped over its midsection, end quote.

55:33.820 --> 55:38.380
Myron noticed four or five frantic personnel outside the building, equipped with white

55:38.380 --> 55:44.020
coveralls, visored headgear, rubber gloves and boots, and a Colt 45 pistol, quote, who

55:44.020 --> 55:47.580
were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, end quote.

55:47.580 --> 55:51.380
From Myron's point of view, the people inside the warehouse were solely concerned about the

55:51.380 --> 55:53.260
object inside the building.

55:53.260 --> 55:57.380
The personnel and delivery men unloaded the bricks by hand from trucks to pallets where

55:57.380 --> 56:02.900
Myron noticed the men were navy, not air force by insignia on their uniforms.

56:02.900 --> 56:07.020
During a break from unloading the shipment, Myron somehow managed to approach the warehouse's

56:07.020 --> 56:09.700
door undetected and peer inside.

56:09.700 --> 56:14.700
He observed metal scaffolding around a large, strange object with men at work.

56:14.700 --> 56:19.300
Puzzling to Myron, parachute silks were suspended from the ceiling, partially enshrouding the

56:19.300 --> 56:23.060
object, lit by one floodlight directed downward.

56:23.060 --> 56:28.740
The object was bell shaped, measuring an estimated 10 feet tall and less than 10 feet wide, appearing

56:28.740 --> 56:35.300
metallic with a dull copper or bronze color, but was charred or covered in a sooty residue.

56:35.300 --> 56:39.500
During pursuing this mystery any further, irresistible, Myron asked one of the personnel

56:39.500 --> 56:42.340
about his use of an acetylene torch.

56:42.340 --> 56:46.460
Myron told Stringfield, quote, probably thinking that my presence there meant I had a proper

56:46.460 --> 56:47.460
clearance.

56:47.460 --> 56:51.900
The man who was wearing a visor told me he was trying to get inside, end quote.

56:51.900 --> 56:56.460
Myron further explained to Stringfield the man told him all attempts to gain entry failed,

56:56.460 --> 56:59.620
whether torch, diamond-headed drill bits, or acid.

56:59.620 --> 57:04.620
This reminds me closely of the testimony of RB I covered in UFO whistleblowers, too,

57:04.620 --> 57:10.140
who stated he guarded a hamburger-shaped saucer in 1963 for two weeks, where a science

57:10.140 --> 57:14.980
team tried and failed with endless methods to gain entry to the craft.

57:14.980 --> 57:18.340
Myron then went on to explain, quote, I was surprised when he told me that if there were

57:18.340 --> 57:23.300
bodies inside, they might be too hot for the mortician to handle, end quote.

57:23.300 --> 57:27.020
Bodies are always a contentious and interesting aspect of UAP retrieval.

57:27.020 --> 57:29.540
We will address this point shortly.

57:29.540 --> 57:33.740
Myron was then startled by the voice of a guard who said, forget what you've seen or

57:33.740 --> 57:37.140
will lock you up and throw away the keys.

57:37.140 --> 57:43.820
And we found the base, and they took us from the backside of the Wright-Patterson Air Base

57:43.820 --> 57:50.620
all the way through the main part of the base, out the other side, down Maple Street, to

57:50.620 --> 57:56.540
the old training center for World War II.

57:56.540 --> 57:59.540
When I walked in and proceeded, I seen the bell shape.

57:59.540 --> 58:07.020
It was sitting there on stelt, and it had a very big parachute or something draped down

58:07.020 --> 58:12.020
over the top with a light up underneath the parachute, trying to cover this thing up so

58:12.020 --> 58:13.700
no one could see it.

58:13.700 --> 58:18.540
And you could see a ladder leaning against the bell before they were trying to get into

58:18.540 --> 58:22.540
one of the openings.

58:22.540 --> 58:26.740
And the guard said that he wasn't allowed to be in here, but how, I've already seen

58:26.740 --> 58:28.580
everything in there.

58:28.580 --> 58:31.540
So it didn't bother me when he ran me back out.

58:31.540 --> 58:38.620
The spaceship looked like a large acorn, runs about 14 feet to the top and about 10

58:38.620 --> 58:46.420
to 12 feet wide at the bottom with a collar on it that has writing on the collar.

58:46.420 --> 58:51.940
And it had a triangle on it, and it looked like the triangle was put on there with a

58:51.940 --> 58:58.940
welder by sticking the welder against the metal to shape the writing, and the writing

58:58.940 --> 59:02.140
was all the way around the bell shape of it.

59:02.140 --> 59:08.900
And the black, the bottom of the bell shape was completely black.

59:08.900 --> 59:15.300
And around the top of the edges was smoke covered, and the space thing looked like it

59:15.300 --> 59:17.620
was copper or bronze.

59:17.620 --> 59:21.020
Stringfield contacted Myron's cousin on October 3, 1990.

59:21.020 --> 59:25.980
J.S., as he'll be referred to, was reluctant to get involved due to family reasons.

59:25.980 --> 59:30.860
He did confirm delivering glazed bricks to right pat with Myron, remembered guards wearing

59:30.860 --> 59:34.300
protective clothing and a technician with a blow torch.

59:34.300 --> 59:38.660
When Stringfield asked J.S. if he had seen the craft in the building, J.S. stated, quote,

59:38.660 --> 59:41.260
I don't remember many details on that trip.

59:41.260 --> 59:45.100
My partner probably knows more because he was more inquisitive.

59:45.100 --> 59:51.020
Fast forward to 1991, Myron told Stringfield J.S. was willing to finally discuss his observations

59:51.020 --> 59:54.540
that fateful December day in 1965.

59:54.540 --> 59:59.820
On March 30 to April 1, 1991, Stringfield again interviewed J.S.

59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.680
J.S. told Stringfield a new story.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.860
He did in fact see the object the day before.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.740
He and Myron went to right pat.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.380
He had made the trip solo with an initial delivery of bricks and clearly recalled an

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:18.220
object shaped like the Liberty Bell sitting upright under a tarp aboard a low-boy trailer.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:23.700
J.S. estimated the craft to be 8 to 10 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet wide, quote, I didn't

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.820
ask any questions, but it probably arrived a short time before I did, end quote.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.460
J.S. discussed activity in the area.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.900
Men wearing fatigued suits and there were armed guards, but he didn't see anyone carrying

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.380
any sort of rifle or machine gun.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.980
Unlike the next day's trip, quote, there was nothing unusual at the entrance gate.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:47.580
I gave the guard my identification and showed him my bill of landing and was directed to

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:56.140
the area for unloading near the big red brick building, end quote.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.460
Like most cases, the discussion of bodies is the most controversial aspect of Kecksburg.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:06.180
In his appearance in the 2003 annual crash retrieval conference proceedings, Stan Gordon

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.460
discussed the subject of bodies present at the crash.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.500
To quote Stan, in more recent years I have heard rumors that are not widely known that

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:19.740
two small bodies were supposedly found at the impact location in 1965.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.100
I have generally accepted this as hearsay since there has never been any evidence to

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.980
back up these claims.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.540
One such testimony actually came from Myron, the trucker we just discussed, who spoke to

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.980
Gordon offering new details in 1998.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.940
In poor health, Myron agreed to meet with Gordon for a documentary Gordon was working

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.820
on titled Kecksburg, the Untold Story.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:46.220
Stan says the two were discussing what Myron saw in 1965, Myron suddenly mentioned something

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:51.620
which caused Stan and the video production crew to look at the man with astonishment.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.700
Myron added to his previous testimony delivered to Gordon and Stringfield, stating when he

01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:00.100
peeked inside the warehouse he observed the bell propped up by scaffolding, but he also

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.060
saw a body lying on a workbench in the same room.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:09.180
Myron added this body was covered in a white sheet, measuring four to five feet tall.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.620
The only feature seen was lizard-like skin from a left hand sticking out from under

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.620
the cover.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.540
I walked in the building and seen the bell shape there and they was working on it.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.260
I also seen an object laying on the workbench over there and the workbench runs about ten

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:29.660
to twelve feet long and about thirty-two inches wide and about three foot, about thirty-six

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.300
inches off the floor.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:37.060
I seen the left hand of every what was in there sticking out underneath of the sterile

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:44.380
white pad and he only had three fingers, it was about four foot nine or four foot five

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:52.580
inches tall if it was standing up, but it looked like it weighed about eighty pounds

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:59.020
and it had dark green or brownish skin and it was just like a lizard.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:05.340
I have no doubt in my mind that the body laid on that table and the left hand of him was

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:12.540
sticking out underneath of the white sterile pad that they had placed over him and he had

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:18.340
the three index finger and his skin looked like lizard.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:25.820
I asked Myron why he waited so many years to divulge what he had seen in 1965.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:31.300
Well for the reason I never said anything before because Uncle Sam said if it were to

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.860
ever leased out and they had to come and lock you up and throw the keys away or give you

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.780
a bullet to satisfy you, no one will ever talk about it.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:45.980
Right now is the time to tell it before something drastic happens and my son, he is twenty-four

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:51.980
years old and he said why are you going to do it now and I said well I may not live till

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:56.380
tomorrow the next day to tell it so I'll tell it all tonight and be done with it.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:03.300
The only thing I've got now is a bad heart and high blood pressure and sugar and on oxygen

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:09.860
once in a while and walking around taking nitroglycerin and all there is now I'm telling

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.820
you now because I may not be here tomorrow.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.420
Why add this onto his story after nearly a decade after his initial testimony?

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.020
Another witness Joel contacted Stan after hearing local news covering Leslie Keane and

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:26.780
the CFI's attempts to pry free Kecksburg documentation.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.820
Gordon would meet with Joel at his home in late 2002, seeing Joel go back and forth on

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.640
whether or not to proceed with the interview in fear of getting in trouble for what he

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640
saw.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.580
Joel claimed on the day of the Kecksburg crash he entered the woods to investigate the crash

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580
film.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:46.980
His attention was drawn to a metal object emanating bright clashes of colors like electricity.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.700
Joel hid in the woods to observe army and air force personnel, men in civilian clothing

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.900
and men in suits and hats enter the crash area.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.260
Joel claimed to have observed an army general hop on top of the metallic object with a probe

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.140
in his hand similar to an officer's billy club.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.740
The general smacked the object and the tool flew out of his hands.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:10.940
Gordon noted at this time Joel's expression changed to a far more somber and uncomfortable

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.940
tone.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.980
Joel stated soon after striking the object a hatch opened that swung from right to left

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:20.340
at the front of the object, accompanied by a whirling hissing sound.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:25.460
Joel described a scene what looked like quote two fingers in an unusually long arm and quote

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.340
inside the hatch before it closed again.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.500
The concept of bodies may be supported by the testimony of Bill Weaver I mentioned earlier

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.500
in the video.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:38.460
Weaver, a teenager, observed men exit a large light colored box truck in what he described

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.940
as moonsuits.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:45.140
The men carried a box shaped device measuring four to five feet square resting upon a stretcher

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.460
with four handles.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:52.340
A little while later there was a large truck pulled in, a light colored truck, a box van

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.340
type.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.460
Out of it there was four guys come out.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.820
They had what we call moonsuits at the time.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.820
They were white cover all type suits.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:08.380
They took a box out of there, a box maybe four or five foot square.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:14.100
They carried down four handles and they carried that down to the object.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.660
About just right after that there was a military man.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:23.300
He came over to the car and he told us to leave and I got into an argument with him.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:27.460
I told him I didn't, you know, I wanted to stay, I didn't want to leave.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:32.060
He told me that he would confiscate my car if I didn't.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.060
What's going on everybody?

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.060
It's UAP Gerb.

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:40.580
Thank you so much for joining me today as we took a deep dive into the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.060
UFO crash.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.540
Now, what would you say if I told you today we just started to scratch the surface of

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.540
this case?

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.340
Like I mentioned earlier in the witnesses tab, there are so many witnesses who have more

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.260
to add to this story.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:59.900
The reason I covered Bulabush, Romansky, Betters, Weaver and so forth is because I think their

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:04.940
testimonies offer the most complete picture and insight into the Kexburg story.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.860
There are other residents who talk about a military base being set up in a home near

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.980
them, kind of like Romansky discussed in his interview on Montel Williams.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.620
There's other witnesses who talk more about the military presence and how it might have

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:21.580
been obfuscated from a certain point of view when the military had reached up on Meteor

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.260
Road and so forth.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:26.700
So there is just so much rich testimony to pursue.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:32.140
The Kexburg case has also seen so much coverage as we saw with Kexburg, the new Roswell, and

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:37.620
Kexburg the Untold Story and Kexburg the Unsolved Mysteries episode in Stan Gordon's

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.380
1993 documentary.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.020
There has been so much coverage on this case.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:48.580
That is why I tried to take a more focused approach on breaking down the crash, focusing

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:53.460
on a select few witnesses, focusing on the overall story, and kind of narrowing in on

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:59.020
what happened to the craft, the bell, after the case, as well as focusing on Eric Walker

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.140
and Lyndon B. Johnson.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.140
Now those of you familiar with the case will know there are a couple things I didn't discuss

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.140
here.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:11.180
One of these was D. Glock, the alleged Nazi wonder weapon that was shaped the exact same

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:16.060
shape as the Kexburg bell, a similar shape to the Liberty bell, and that is because I

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.820
would like to cover that and cover sort of Nick Cook's work in the hunt for zero point

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.140
and the Nazi connection to UAP in a whole nother video.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:30.100
I also left out claims of Kexburg and affirmation of Kexburg from the witness Clifford Stone

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.380
who testified in the 2001 NPC conference under Stephen Greer.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.340
I did this because of course Clifford Stone carries with him a little bit of controversy

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:44.740
so I want to analyze his claims and his merits before I put them into a Kexburg case in their

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.140
own video.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.580
Now what were your favorite parts of this investigation?

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.380
For me, I must say I just I adore Jim Romansky.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.500
I think he's an incredible witness, probably my favorite eyewitness of any case, the way

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.860
in which he passionately talks about the case and any interview he has, especially Montell

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860
Williams.

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.020
I really appreciate his demeanor, I think he offers valuable insights into this case and

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.700
especially the Montell Williams show where he discusses kind of how his children faced

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:17.740
issues with his experience at Kexburg.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:22.300
Also I hope everybody enjoyed kind of the oblique look into the blue berets.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.260
I think that's one of the most crucial aspects of this investigation.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:29.100
They need to be investigated much more and I will continue to do so over the course of

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.700
my videos.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.900
Investigate there the incident Fort McGuire Dix as Leonard Stringfield supposed blue

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:37.140
beret insider has claimed.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.180
Try to kind of focus in on the security police and Air Force police aspect of the blue berets

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:47.580
and see if these guys might be used as a rapid reaction unit for kind of domestic or even

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.980
foreign crash retrieval efforts.

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:53.260
Also of course I've talked about it in many videos and he's a person I view a sort of

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:58.060
a linchpin to the whole UAP phenomena, Dr. Eric A Walker.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.740
Of course in this video we saw, we talked about this in the Sarbakar video but we ran

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:08.860
over his claims about saying he was in fact the Kexburg case and that he did know about

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:15.940
Majestic 12 and Robert Sarbakar was correct in terms of Dr. Eric A Walker being a crucial

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.380
member in UFO crash retrieval.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.300
But what was new to me here was the UARC the university affiliated research center in the

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.860
ARL at Penn State University.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:29.420
I think there's some great connections there to explore and I will continue to do so as

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.420
well.

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.340
Also I found the Lyndon B Johnson connections with Dr. Eric Walker as well as Johnson's

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:38.420
meeting scheduled the day after Kexburg fascinating.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:43.220
Now if you look in the show notes and you can also find these PDFs posted in my discord

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.900
if you don't want to go to the link of Grant Cameron's files but you will see all of the

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.260
files I reference because I really recommend following along.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:55.140
I just gave a brief sample of some of the content we went over in this video but there's

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.860
pages and pages and pages of Grant Cameron covering this case.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:03.500
I also really recommend reading crash retrievals one through seven string fields work and seeing

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.020
how he approached the Kexburg case over a span of ten years.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:12.740
It's really fascinating to see him kind of reference uncle the alleged insider he talked

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:18.540
to a through a media intermediary with and just him a interview Pete who is now of course

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:23.980
James Jim Romansky interview Myron and so forth speaking of Myron I find this witness

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.580
so interesting.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.700
Initially I found it to be quite a red flag that Myron initially approached Stan Gordon

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:39.940
in the late 80s and also spoke to Leonard Stringfield and it wasn't until 1992 1993

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:44.340
for Stan Gordon's newest documentary that Myron touched on the topic of bodies when

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:49.820
he had only commented on what a personnel at the base had said to him before about it

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.780
being a hot issue for autopsies.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.940
I think this case is a little different than something like the 1955 Del Rio case with

01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:02.540
Robert Willingham as Robert Willingham initially stated he saw no such bodies and then changed

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.740
his tone in about the Jeff Rents episode maybe in 2008 2012 I want to say around the time

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.660
of the the book by Noah Torres came out.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.740
Watching Myron was very interesting because that was a late pop up in my research seen

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.860
his interview in the 1993 Stan Gordon documentary.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:26.300
He of course as he claimed felt much fear and that's why he kind of omitted the topic

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:33.060
of bodies before now there are a couple other witnesses who claim or are adjacent to body

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:37.860
claims here such as Don Sebastian I didn't cover him just because I didn't see how his

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:43.740
story really really gelled with other witnesses because he described when he approached the

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:48.220
scene and saw military men and was kind of hiding around observing the military operations

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:54.460
he heard a loud scream from the forest no other individual in the present area has also admitted

01:12:54.460 --> 01:13:00.100
hearing this scream so I left that out what did you guys think of the Kecksburg case I

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.980
want to know everybody's thoughts this of course is such a famous case of course I

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.420
think it's pretty self-evident this crash case has something very tangible something

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.620
that actually crashed in the woods in Kecksburg and this was not a meteor as Blue Book claimed

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:17.980
I think the the discussion of the chaff discovered alongside the meteor where the Blue Book team

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:24.060
from the 660 second radar squadron is extremely interesting I also am unsure about the claims

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:29.660
of Soviet capsule or American capsule I think there's plenty of evidence and discussion to

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:37.020
dispute the landing of a human-made space object I was really excited to relay this bell shape to

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:43.340
the infographics whistleblower and that reddit whistleblower post all too often in crash cases

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.780
we mainly hear about saucers or egg shapes so it's really cool to focus some attention on this

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:56.300
kind of almost a liberty bell shaped craft with strange hieroglyphs hieroglyphic writings on it

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:02.220
I think it's it's such a unique type of craft especially as described by many of the witnesses

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:08.060
just big enough to fit an individual maybe two the off-white the off-yellow bronze-ish color

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:14.140
and the fact this alongside other craft descriptions seems like it was made out of a single piece of

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:20.220
metal like pouring liquid metal into a cast I love this case right now I lean towards this

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:25.340
being a legitimate UAP retrieval case I think there's a lot of evidence here a lot more evidence

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:30.220
that needs to be pursued of course the only thing missing from this case with all of the

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:36.700
witness testimony with Johnson with Walker with with with all the witnesses after the fact is some

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:41.420
official documents and those of course are very scant in this case because apparently NASA lost

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:47.500
them in 1987 but again let me know what you guys think I want to appreciate every single person

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.740
here watching this video thank you so much for giving me your time I can't believe you guys will

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:57.660
sit through about an hour and a half I think at this time video please remember to leave a like

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:02.780
and subscription means the most leave some comments let me know what you think remember guys I have a

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:07.740
patreon I don't charge for any extra content I don't gate keep content on there only support

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:12.620
what you think the channel is worth we got big things coming for the channel of course regular

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:17.020
viewers will know that we're doing about one live a week I want to start doing some more interviews

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:23.340
on the channel too I know right now that interviews I've had usually take three weeks or so to conjure

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:28.140
up because there's so much editing involved I do want to do some pure interviews as well but of

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:32.940
course I'll be in the lab working on my my interview skills because I can get very tripped up with my

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:37.340
words as you all know but thank you so much for watching guys I will catch everybody on the next

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:41.900
show thank you
