  \ Air Force UFO encounters to leave you perplexed! The Gorman Dogfight, the Finnish\
  \ UAP Air Force Sighting of 1969, the Arequipa Encounter, and the 2004 Mexican Air\
  \ Force Incident are extremely underrepresented cases when compared to the incredibly\
  \ famous Gimbal, Go Fast, and UFO tapes released by the NYT in 2017.  \n\nUFO cases\
  \ by military air forces, navy, or ground personnel are often extremely credible\
  \ sightings due to multi-sensor detection and the keen, trained eye of fighter pilots.\
  \ Oftentimes, global sightings are drowned out by the ever-popular US cases; so\
  \ for that reason, let's cover not just the US but Global UFO encounters with military\
  \ jets.\n\nSome cases pictured are legendary in their respective countries and some\
  \ have been discovered through official USG Project Sign or Moon Dust Documents.\
  \ So what do you think? Did these pilots experience Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\
  \ or are their sightings explained away through prosaic means? Leave a comment below\
  \ giving your thoughts on each case. \n\nThank you for joining and please remember\
