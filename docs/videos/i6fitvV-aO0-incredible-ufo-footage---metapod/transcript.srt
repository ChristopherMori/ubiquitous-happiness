1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
More often than not, UFO footage is grainy, blurry, minuscule, and difficult to make out,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,160
or is a collection of pixels on a downgraded USG FLIR platform.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,400
This often leads to the video's feeling impersonal.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,280
But how often do you get to see a truly anomalous craft up close?

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,400
Well, there is one video of a UFO filmed in Spain that, if true, is one of the best close-up

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,280
views of a UFO ever recorded.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,520
Guys, I am UAPGurb, and I'm not wasting any time today.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,360
So let's do another footage analysis of one of my favorite pieces of alleged UFO footage,

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,520
the famous Metapod, as filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,640
This is one of my all-time favorite pieces of alleged footage that has shocking connections

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
to other sightings and footage worldwide.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,400
So let's take a look first at our footage stabilized.

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's take a look at the footage.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:19,280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:29,280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:39,280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

18
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:52,880
So what do you think after first watch?

19
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Pretty astounding, right?

20
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,280
Similar to the fly-by video, this footage is too anomalous, too clear,

21
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,240
and too strange to possibly be true, right?

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,320
Well, let's start a little analysis and kind of see what we can uncover.

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,840
I want to disclaim that I am using YouTube channel ItsBS's stabilized footage of the

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,040
metapod due to the fact that the original poster of this video UFO VNI has taken down the footage

25
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,920
as well as the 2017 reupload by YouTube channel UFO invasions.

26
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,520
ItsBS's channel will be listed in the video description.

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Unlike fly-by, we can actually trace back the origins of the metapod footage.

28
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:46,320
On September 7th, 2015, a man named Modesta emailed YouTube channel UFO VNI as mentioned above

29
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,600
after reading that this channel could publish UFO footage.

30
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,760
On screen now is the original email, and here let me read a transcription translated into English.

31
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,400
Hello UFO VNI. I have read on your YouTube page that you can publish the video that I took the

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,120
day before yesterday, September 6th, 2015, together with a friend named Moises. My name

33
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,280
is Modesto. What we saw yesterday I sincerely know was not from here. I have been in the

34
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,360
countryside for many years and I have been able to hear the wings of storks in flight.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
What we saw did not make any noise, it descended vertically and he walked away.

36
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,560
I must admit that I am somewhat nearsighted but my friend can see hairs and quails in the same way

37
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,920
as finding a needle in a haystack. My friend commented that he saw something moving inside

38
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,160
the UFO. Something alive with limbs, I believe it. Due to personal reasons and the location

39
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,640
of the sighting we do not want to give the exact location of the sighting, but I can tell you that

40
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:54,400
it was near El Escorial, direction Las Navas del Marques. El Escorial is a place where strange

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,160
things happen, but not in the city, but in the nearby mountains. Personally, I neither believed

42
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,720
nor did I believe in UFOs or extraterrestrials. It simply seemed like, quote, nonsense from Uncle

43
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Iker and four other idiots, end quote. Now, that is, from that moment on, I knew that it wasn't

44
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,240
from here, that it wasn't human. My friend Modesto, however, a little more attack at turn

45
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
and from the town than me, I never known what he thought but it seems that he is not surprised

46
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,200
to see it. After the video that I sent him and some photos that, as you will see, did not turn

47
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,680
out very well, my friend Modesto told me, quote, here again, in reference to the object. After

48
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,640
asking him about the meaning of his expression, he did not want to say much more, except that it

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,000
is not the first time he has seen it and that his father, now deceased, had also seen it.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,200
If it is of importance to him, I will ask, give him the GPS data and exact location,

51
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,160
but only for his investigation so that he does not make said data or the relationship with

52
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,800
the video public. The place is called redacted and is at the coordinates redacted in the direction

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,400
in which he went was north south. I asked for strict rigor and commitment to save my personal

54
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,320
or contact information. On the contrary, I send and deliver the video and I give it to you. For

55
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,080
your use and disposition as you please. PS, I'll send you the video later with a link to the cloud

56
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,320
or if you prefer, I'll send you the micro SD card by email. What stands out to me about this email?

57
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,640
Well, for one, the sender Modesto claims that he is Modesto and his friend Moises recorded the

58
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,280
footage. Later on, he says, quote, my friend Modesto. Is this a careless mistake of using pseudonyms

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,400
as the sender was already unwilling to provide the exact location of the sighting? Anyways,

60
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,680
Modesto goes on to state that this was not the first time his friend had seen this object

61
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,600
and that his father had seen it also. Modesto's companion also said he saw something moving

62
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,480
inside of the UFO. It's unknown to me why UFO V and I took down this video, perhaps at Modesto's

63
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,320
request, but I have contacted him to learn more. Posts about this footage began popping up around

64
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,080
the internet almost immediately, as seen in this now taken down Portuguese forum on September 8,

65
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,600
2015, called ETS and ETC. Translating this page, we can see the site does not know if the video

66
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,400
is real or fake, but is impressed nonetheless. What caught this site's attention was realistic zoom,

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,920
very realistic focus and blur, the shape of the UFO, and similarities to the 2006 La Bruja in

68
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,680
Mexico. I'll cover this soon. A post also appeared on the site Third Phase of the Sun

69
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,600
on September 11, 2015, which additionally detailed UFO V and I's correspondence with Modesto.

70
00:07:51,920 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm willing to bet you've probably never seen a UFO in this shape, especially one structured like

71
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,480
such a physical craft in which a solid metallic reflective looking material makes up the back

72
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,000
bulk of the craft in a very logical design with a front-facing transparent material that looks

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,600
almost similar to glass for, you know, possible viewing opportunities. Some argue, like Third

74
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Phase of the Sun, that they can make out a bean resting inside of the craft. However, I disagree

75
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
here and think this is simply the reflection of sunlight on the transparent material on the front

76
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,000
face of the craft. This pod features three of five characteristics of UAP as listed by ATIP

77
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:12,880
and Lou Elizondo. Instantaneous acceleration as seen in the altitude drop, anti-gravity slash

78
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:26,560
no visible signs of propulsion, and low observability. The craft exhibits intelligent flight characteristics

79
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,480
including that sudden drop in altitude, standstill and winds as we can hear from camera wind

80
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:42,960
interference, linear traversal away from the recorder, and variable stable rotation along

81
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:50,000
its x-axis. Especially take note here when the craft's rotation goes from counterclockwise

82
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:07,280
to clockwise, exhibiting variable acceleration in both methods of rotation.

83
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,840
I'd like to thank Reddit user UNVMBKY for translating the audio in this footage. I'm

84
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,480
going to overlay his translation with the original footage, and to note something added by NVBKY,

85
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,480
the audio sounds like it has been processed with a noise reduction filter, either added in post

86
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:45,120
processing or directly applied by the camera to filter out the wind.

87
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:19,840
As you can guess, many have tried to debunk this sighting as a balloon, such as this heart

88
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,520
custom made balloon, or balloon tent, and no I'm not kidding, this comparison with this

89
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,920
flatable tent is used as an actual source for a debunk, or possibly an object suspended on a string

90
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,800
which is the same explanation used to try and debunk the very real McMinnville photographs,

91
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,080
and lastly CGI. The CGI debunkers enjoy using these three frames of craft jitter when analyzing

92
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,200
the craft altitude drop stabilized, but even the balloon crowd detracts from this argument

93
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,920
on Mick West's website Metabunk, in which the jitters are consistent with the craft,

94
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,720
or in this case balloon, experiencing altitude drops in air currents. Of course, I'm no VFX

95
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,560
artist so I cannot comment on any visual artifacts that could either confirm or deny the footage's

96
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,640
authenticity, but what I can tell you is that for me, this footage passes the simple eye test,

97
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,760
and I can draw attention to half a dozen pieces of other footage in which this same craft is shown.

98
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,680
While we review these other sightings, I want you to take note of a couple things in all of the

99
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,560
footage we are about to view. The overall crescent moon shape of the pod, the transparent glass-like

100
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,360
material on one face of the pod, reflectivity of sunlight off the craft, and the vertical

101
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,600
orientation in which the craft stands when it rotates about its z-axis. The first observation

102
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,160
I can track of the metapod shape is the famous Los Perracadistas de Maipú or the parachutes

103
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,320
of Maipú footage taken in 1998 in Peru. In this footage, we can see what appears to be five or

104
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,160
more pots with the same body and reflective paneling as our metapod footage. Now, let's cover the

105
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,280
aforementioned Monterey Witch or La Bruja as seen in Mexico in 2006. This footage appears to show the

106
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,240
backside, the non-transparent side of the metapod moving away from the recorder, through some

107
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,160
hills and brush in the same vertical positioning I mentioned earlier.

108
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,240
In 2021 in Vancouver, the same pod was recorded. Here we observe the same crescent moon shape

109
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,760
and reflectivity in sunlight. Some interesting things to take note of by the OP of this footage.

110
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,320
Three of these objects appeared, close together at first maybe 20 feet from each other moving north.

111
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,000
They moved on a horizontal plane, two of the objects then ascended up fast in the third

112
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
continued horizontal north until out of sight. The two went upwards, then one continued north

113
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,480
until it disappeared and the others west until it disappeared. And now we get to possibly the most

114
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,440
crucial corroborating multiple sightings of the metapod craft. In 2022, a couple frames allegedly

115
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,520
leaked from a U.S. Navy, Blue Angel cockpit recording of a UFO dropping from the clouds.

116
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,720
Similar to our flyby footage, this is a second generation recording if the mouse on the screen

117
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,520
didn't give it away. Take a look at these frames below.

118
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,240
Pretty incredible, right? Let's go frame by frame to compare to the metapod.

119
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,640
In these three frames, we see the metapod descending rapidly in a horizontal orientation.

120
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,880
Appearing as though the transparent face is facing away from the craft's trajectory.

121
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,600
Interestingly enough, four other signatures appear alongside the craft.

122
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,800
In this frame, we see the back of the craft facing the ground with the transparent face

123
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,680
oriented towards the sky. If this leak is true and believe me, I'm still trying to get to the

124
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,440
bottom of it, the metapod shape is a legitimate form of UAP. Some like to compare the metapod to

125
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,320
the gimbal footage and while it matches the outline of the FLIR footage, I am hesitant to

126
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,920
make this comparison seen as the FLIR footage does not necessarily reflect the object's true shape,

127
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,880
so we will at least keep this explanation to gimbal in mind, but not claim it as fact.

128
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,720
And lastly, we have a hang glider cruising through the skies of Texas in 2023,

129
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,080
appearing to observe the metapod. While early and late frames of this video accurately show

130
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,320
the vertically positioned pod, the front facing view throws some doubt into the footage's credibility

131
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
in my opinion as it does not match the metapod seen in other videos.

132
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,520
Of all the videos we have reviewed, this in my opinion has probably the best chance of being

133
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,200
something prosaic or misidentified like a balloon. A 15 to 20 minute video for a 1 to 2 minute

134
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,080
piece of footage? Of course! I'm UAPGurb, you guys know what we're getting into,

135
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,560
I won't settle for anything less than a full analysis. I hope you guys enjoyed this look

136
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,920
into the metapod footage. I remember when this piece of footage first dropped, I was so fascinated,

137
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,480
I had to get to the bottom of it, because there were a couple of accounts on various platforms

138
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,800
like Reddit who reuploaded the video saying it was filmed in Denver, which is my city,

139
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,760
which was just a fallacy, so I'm not sure where that came from, but remember this footage originates

140
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,600
in Spain, but what do you guys think about this metapod footage? Is it too fantastic to be true,

141
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,760
or is it real? I know the memes, I know it looks like the show me what you got heads from Rick and

142
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Morty, but this craft at least to me looks like the real deal, and it's shocking that it almost

143
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,920
looks like a single beam observation craft with the transparent window that almost seems like glass.

144
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,880
It's so enigmatic, I don't even know, I don't even know where to begin thinking about the

145
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,320
implications of this craft and what is piloting it, especially with the non-observable propulsion

146
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,600
methods, but I wanted to get this video out today guys, I know today it is the, I think the 11th of

147
