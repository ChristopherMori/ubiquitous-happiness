0	7360	More often than not, UFO footage is grainy, blurry, minuscule, and difficult to make out,
7360	12160	or is a collection of pixels on a downgraded USG FLIR platform.
12160	15400	This often leads to the video's feeling impersonal.
15400	19280	But how often do you get to see a truly anomalous craft up close?
19280	26400	Well, there is one video of a UFO filmed in Spain that, if true, is one of the best close-up
26400	29280	views of a UFO ever recorded.
29760	33520	Guys, I am UAPGurb, and I'm not wasting any time today.
33520	39360	So let's do another footage analysis of one of my favorite pieces of alleged UFO footage,
39360	47520	the famous Metapod, as filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.
47520	52640	This is one of my all-time favorite pieces of alleged footage that has shocking connections
52640	55520	to other sightings and footage worldwide.
55520	58400	So let's take a look first at our footage stabilized.
119280	121280	Let's take a look at the footage.
121280	129280	This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.
129280	139280	This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.
139280	149280	This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.
149280	159280	This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.
159280	172880	So what do you think after first watch?
172880	174400	Pretty astounding, right?
174400	179280	Similar to the fly-by video, this footage is too anomalous, too clear,
179280	182240	and too strange to possibly be true, right?
182800	186320	Well, let's start a little analysis and kind of see what we can uncover.
187040	191840	I want to disclaim that I am using YouTube channel ItsBS's stabilized footage of the
191840	199040	metapod due to the fact that the original poster of this video UFO VNI has taken down the footage
199040	203920	as well as the 2017 reupload by YouTube channel UFO invasions.
204560	207520	ItsBS's channel will be listed in the video description.
208400	216960	Unlike fly-by, we can actually trace back the origins of the metapod footage.
217520	226320	On September 7th, 2015, a man named Modesta emailed YouTube channel UFO VNI as mentioned above
226320	229600	after reading that this channel could publish UFO footage.
230320	235760	On screen now is the original email, and here let me read a transcription translated into English.
236720	242400	Hello UFO VNI. I have read on your YouTube page that you can publish the video that I took the
242400	249120	day before yesterday, September 6th, 2015, together with a friend named Moises. My name
249120	255280	is Modesto. What we saw yesterday I sincerely know was not from here. I have been in the
255280	259360	countryside for many years and I have been able to hear the wings of storks in flight.
260000	264320	What we saw did not make any noise, it descended vertically and he walked away.
265120	270560	I must admit that I am somewhat nearsighted but my friend can see hairs and quails in the same way
270560	275920	as finding a needle in a haystack. My friend commented that he saw something moving inside
275920	282160	the UFO. Something alive with limbs, I believe it. Due to personal reasons and the location
282160	286640	of the sighting we do not want to give the exact location of the sighting, but I can tell you that
286640	294400	it was near El Escorial, direction Las Navas del Marques. El Escorial is a place where strange
294400	300160	things happen, but not in the city, but in the nearby mountains. Personally, I neither believed
300160	306720	nor did I believe in UFOs or extraterrestrials. It simply seemed like, quote, nonsense from Uncle
306720	312720	Iker and four other idiots, end quote. Now, that is, from that moment on, I knew that it wasn't
312720	318240	from here, that it wasn't human. My friend Modesto, however, a little more attack at turn
318240	323520	and from the town than me, I never known what he thought but it seems that he is not surprised
323520	329200	to see it. After the video that I sent him and some photos that, as you will see, did not turn
329200	335680	out very well, my friend Modesto told me, quote, here again, in reference to the object. After
335680	340640	asking him about the meaning of his expression, he did not want to say much more, except that it
340640	346000	is not the first time he has seen it and that his father, now deceased, had also seen it.
346000	351200	If it is of importance to him, I will ask, give him the GPS data and exact location,
351200	356160	but only for his investigation so that he does not make said data or the relationship with
356160	362800	the video public. The place is called redacted and is at the coordinates redacted in the direction
362800	368400	in which he went was north south. I asked for strict rigor and commitment to save my personal
368400	374320	or contact information. On the contrary, I send and deliver the video and I give it to you. For
374320	380080	your use and disposition as you please. PS, I'll send you the video later with a link to the cloud
380080	386320	or if you prefer, I'll send you the micro SD card by email. What stands out to me about this email?
386320	392640	Well, for one, the sender Modesto claims that he is Modesto and his friend Moises recorded the
392640	399280	footage. Later on, he says, quote, my friend Modesto. Is this a careless mistake of using pseudonyms
399280	404400	as the sender was already unwilling to provide the exact location of the sighting? Anyways,
404400	409680	Modesto goes on to state that this was not the first time his friend had seen this object
409680	415600	and that his father had seen it also. Modesto's companion also said he saw something moving
415600	422480	inside of the UFO. It's unknown to me why UFO V and I took down this video, perhaps at Modesto's
422480	428320	request, but I have contacted him to learn more. Posts about this footage began popping up around
428320	434080	the internet almost immediately, as seen in this now taken down Portuguese forum on September 8,
434080	441600	2015, called ETS and ETC. Translating this page, we can see the site does not know if the video
441600	448400	is real or fake, but is impressed nonetheless. What caught this site's attention was realistic zoom,
449040	455920	very realistic focus and blur, the shape of the UFO, and similarities to the 2006 La Bruja in
455920	461680	Mexico. I'll cover this soon. A post also appeared on the site Third Phase of the Sun
461680	467600	on September 11, 2015, which additionally detailed UFO V and I's correspondence with Modesto.
471920	496480	I'm willing to bet you've probably never seen a UFO in this shape, especially one structured like
496560	504480	such a physical craft in which a solid metallic reflective looking material makes up the back
504480	512000	bulk of the craft in a very logical design with a front-facing transparent material that looks
512000	519600	almost similar to glass for, you know, possible viewing opportunities. Some argue, like Third
519600	526000	Phase of the Sun, that they can make out a bean resting inside of the craft. However, I disagree
526000	530720	here and think this is simply the reflection of sunlight on the transparent material on the front
530720	538000	face of the craft. This pod features three of five characteristics of UAP as listed by ATIP
538000	552880	and Lou Elizondo. Instantaneous acceleration as seen in the altitude drop, anti-gravity slash
552880	566560	no visible signs of propulsion, and low observability. The craft exhibits intelligent flight characteristics
566560	572480	including that sudden drop in altitude, standstill and winds as we can hear from camera wind
572480	582960	interference, linear traversal away from the recorder, and variable stable rotation along
582960	590000	its x-axis. Especially take note here when the craft's rotation goes from counterclockwise
590000	607280	to clockwise, exhibiting variable acceleration in both methods of rotation.
611360	617840	I'd like to thank Reddit user UNVMBKY for translating the audio in this footage. I'm
617840	624480	going to overlay his translation with the original footage, and to note something added by NVBKY,
625040	630480	the audio sounds like it has been processed with a noise reduction filter, either added in post
630480	645120	processing or directly applied by the camera to filter out the wind.
720480	739840	As you can guess, many have tried to debunk this sighting as a balloon, such as this heart
739840	745520	custom made balloon, or balloon tent, and no I'm not kidding, this comparison with this
745520	751920	flatable tent is used as an actual source for a debunk, or possibly an object suspended on a string
751920	756800	which is the same explanation used to try and debunk the very real McMinnville photographs,
757360	764080	and lastly CGI. The CGI debunkers enjoy using these three frames of craft jitter when analyzing
764080	769200	the craft altitude drop stabilized, but even the balloon crowd detracts from this argument
769200	773920	on Mick West's website Metabunk, in which the jitters are consistent with the craft,
774000	780720	or in this case balloon, experiencing altitude drops in air currents. Of course, I'm no VFX
780720	786560	artist so I cannot comment on any visual artifacts that could either confirm or deny the footage's
786560	792640	authenticity, but what I can tell you is that for me, this footage passes the simple eye test,
792640	799760	and I can draw attention to half a dozen pieces of other footage in which this same craft is shown.
804480	809680	While we review these other sightings, I want you to take note of a couple things in all of the
809680	816560	footage we are about to view. The overall crescent moon shape of the pod, the transparent glass-like
816560	823360	material on one face of the pod, reflectivity of sunlight off the craft, and the vertical
823360	829600	orientation in which the craft stands when it rotates about its z-axis. The first observation
829600	836160	I can track of the metapod shape is the famous Los Perracadistas de Maipú or the parachutes
836160	842320	of Maipú footage taken in 1998 in Peru. In this footage, we can see what appears to be five or
842320	848160	more pots with the same body and reflective paneling as our metapod footage. Now, let's cover the
848160	855280	aforementioned Monterey Witch or La Bruja as seen in Mexico in 2006. This footage appears to show the
855280	860240	backside, the non-transparent side of the metapod moving away from the recorder, through some
860240	864160	hills and brush in the same vertical positioning I mentioned earlier.
873920	880240	In 2021 in Vancouver, the same pod was recorded. Here we observe the same crescent moon shape
880240	885760	and reflectivity in sunlight. Some interesting things to take note of by the OP of this footage.
886480	892320	Three of these objects appeared, close together at first maybe 20 feet from each other moving north.
892880	898000	They moved on a horizontal plane, two of the objects then ascended up fast in the third
898000	904000	continued horizontal north until out of sight. The two went upwards, then one continued north
904000	910480	until it disappeared and the others west until it disappeared. And now we get to possibly the most
910560	917440	crucial corroborating multiple sightings of the metapod craft. In 2022, a couple frames allegedly
917440	923520	leaked from a U.S. Navy, Blue Angel cockpit recording of a UFO dropping from the clouds.
923520	928720	Similar to our flyby footage, this is a second generation recording if the mouse on the screen
928800	931520	didn't give it away. Take a look at these frames below.
944400	948240	Pretty incredible, right? Let's go frame by frame to compare to the metapod.
948960	954640	In these three frames, we see the metapod descending rapidly in a horizontal orientation.
954720	958880	Appearing as though the transparent face is facing away from the craft's trajectory.
959760	963600	Interestingly enough, four other signatures appear alongside the craft.
964560	968800	In this frame, we see the back of the craft facing the ground with the transparent face
968800	973680	oriented towards the sky. If this leak is true and believe me, I'm still trying to get to the
973680	979440	bottom of it, the metapod shape is a legitimate form of UAP. Some like to compare the metapod to
979440	984320	the gimbal footage and while it matches the outline of the FLIR footage, I am hesitant to
984320	989920	make this comparison seen as the FLIR footage does not necessarily reflect the object's true shape,
990480	994880	so we will at least keep this explanation to gimbal in mind, but not claim it as fact.
995760	1000720	And lastly, we have a hang glider cruising through the skies of Texas in 2023,
1000720	1006080	appearing to observe the metapod. While early and late frames of this video accurately show
1006080	1012320	the vertically positioned pod, the front facing view throws some doubt into the footage's credibility
1012320	1016000	in my opinion as it does not match the metapod seen in other videos.
1018560	1023520	Of all the videos we have reviewed, this in my opinion has probably the best chance of being
1023520	1031200	something prosaic or misidentified like a balloon. A 15 to 20 minute video for a 1 to 2 minute
1031200	1036080	piece of footage? Of course! I'm UAPGurb, you guys know what we're getting into,
1036080	1040560	I won't settle for anything less than a full analysis. I hope you guys enjoyed this look
1040560	1045920	into the metapod footage. I remember when this piece of footage first dropped, I was so fascinated,
1045920	1050480	I had to get to the bottom of it, because there were a couple of accounts on various platforms
1050480	1054800	like Reddit who reuploaded the video saying it was filmed in Denver, which is my city,
1054800	1059760	which was just a fallacy, so I'm not sure where that came from, but remember this footage originates
1059760	1065600	in Spain, but what do you guys think about this metapod footage? Is it too fantastic to be true,
1065600	1069760	or is it real? I know the memes, I know it looks like the show me what you got heads from Rick and
1069760	1076560	Morty, but this craft at least to me looks like the real deal, and it's shocking that it almost
1076560	1083920	looks like a single beam observation craft with the transparent window that almost seems like glass.
1085360	1090880	It's so enigmatic, I don't even know, I don't even know where to begin thinking about the
1090880	1098320	implications of this craft and what is piloting it, especially with the non-observable propulsion
1098320	1105600	methods, but I wanted to get this video out today guys, I know today it is the, I think the 11th of
1105600	1110560	February, the Sol Foundation just released a bunch of interviews with Grush, Chris Mellon,
1110560	1115200	Kevin Knuth, Hal Putoff, so the next video which I'm going to try to get out as quick as possible,
1115200	1120240	I'm going to be reviewing all those panels and kind of putting out my thoughts, so I wanted to get
1120240	1125200	this footage out, and of course I couldn't slack, had to make sure it was pretty beefy, so please
1125280	1129040	remember to like and subscribe, leave a comment which you thought, let's get a dialogue started,
1129040	1134240	and thank you so much for tuning in guys, I'll catch you guys on the next episode I put out,
1134240	1134880	appreciate it.
