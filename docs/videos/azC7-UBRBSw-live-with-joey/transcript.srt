1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Okay. Hello, my friends. Can everybody hear us? We're live. If everybody can hear me,

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:19,720
Towney, 3057, I appreciate that so much, man. If everybody can hear us, just say something

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:31,520
in the chat. Let me know. Uh-oh. I think we're good. Yes, we can hear. Okay. All right, cool.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,640
Let me say it again. Towney, thank you, brother. I appreciate that a lot. Welcome, guys. This

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,400
is the first live stream I have ever done. I'm here with Joey. This is his first ever

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,840
public appearance, and there's 30 people here already. So, coming through loud here,

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,440
you're being here. Yeah, thanks for having me. This was like really crazy. So, I've been

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,400
here for a few days now, and Bruce Buffer to introduce you. Real quick, yesterday I made

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,880
Joey watch a fight night, and he was craving Bruce Buffer's sweet voice and his awesome suit,

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:15,400
but keep going. Curb is a huge UFC fan. If you guys don't know this, it was quite wild to be on

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:23,240
the couch with him watching it. But yeah, so, you know, after, what's up, Bertie? A year of,

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,120
hey, Xavier, I see you there. After a year of investigating Michael Herrera's case,

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,600
so, I'm Joey is not your name on Reddit. You know, I've been investigating his case for

14
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,520
about a year now. Finally, for the first time, took the trip to Denver to meet up with him

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,240
for the first time, and luckily, Curb here is in the area and was gracious enough to host me.

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Yeah, so, we've just had a packed few days, and with this live stream, what we want to do is just

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,320
kind of like recap, you know, how the last few days went, some of the things we did, and of course,

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,800
you know, talk about our experience with Michael. Yeah, and any questions you guys have?

19
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,560
List them in the chat. We'll try and get to everything. So, the story kind of went. We have

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,360
been planning this trip for a couple months. Now, of course, I've said this in some comments. I don't

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,440
know how many people have seen this, but I've been pretty public about this. I actually got to meet

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,120
Michael a couple months ago. And so, I actually took him out to dinner. He's in Colorado. Y'all

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,320
know I'm in Colorado. So, we actually got some food. So, this wasn't my first time meeting Michael,

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,920
but it was Joey's. And real quick, Boxie Brown. Yes, if you see the poster in the background,

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,640
I stepped that made this for me, and I love it. And Joey, on my main table, we go grab, oh,

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,680
if you don't mind, you got UFOs. Sub last night from Michigan, Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob was

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:02,040
our strange times. Don't forget that you can click on that. We'll get to that. Joey made me this,

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,680
guys. Isn't this sweet? And you know what? He didn't ask for the logo or anything to not let

29
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,720
me know anything was up. So, he made this from his own hand, which is insane. As far as getting banned

30
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,640
for UFOs, let's, Joey, can you unban this man? What is this? What is he saying? He says he got

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,400
banned from UFOs for mentioning the Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob Lazar. Oh, I see. I don't know

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,080
anything about that. So, yeah, I'll have to look into that. Bernie wants to know what Joey thinks

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,800
about Nathan. We will absolutely get to that when we talk, when we kind of mention it. We'll start

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,720
so kind of the weekend on Friday, Joey was here and we met up with Michael for dinner.

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,000
That's when we were originally planning to do the first live. And right after that, we've,

36
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,120
sorry, just looking at some comments. Sorry, guys, this is my first live. So, if anything's a bit

37
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,160
sloppy, that's probably why. But Friday night, we met up with Michael for dinner. He is a business

38
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,480
owner. So, we went to one of his videos to film an interview. And right now, we have all the footage.

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,080
We use three cameras. Joey has some incredible gear. So, it's very professionally recorded.

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,680
I think we got about like four hours of footage. I think it was less than that. I think

41
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:25,080
scallions, maybe two and a half to three hours, I think, of footage. But yeah, we set it up in one of

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,560
his conference rooms and set up a few different angles. We have like a tight shot on Michael.

43
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,040
Kind of felt that was important to kind of get his reaction to, you know, questions that, you know,

44
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,760
as they were being asked to him and kind of close up. But one thing that was really cool,

45
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:50,920
do you have the paper? The drawing? Yeah. So, at one point, you know, when he got to the craft,

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,840
we were like, hey, can you just like draw this? And so, we've got this really cool kind of sequence

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:04,760
of him going through, you know, kind of his memory as he's drawing this. And so, I thought that was

48
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,240
kind of neat, you know. I want to give a quick thank you to scallions. I really appreciate that,

49
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,040
brother. And Bernie and Rob here, if you, like, not agreeing with Michael, that's something that's

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,200
totally all right. This case, you know, Joey and I have discussed this at length and discussed this

51
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,160
with Michael. It's a, and somebody in another Discord asked a really pertinent question, like,

52
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,520
what is, why is it so hard for a lot of people, like including myself from the get go, you know,

53
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,400
but my first video I made on Michael, I was super skeptical about it. You know, why is his story

54
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,440
so hard to believe? And I totally understand a lot of the skepticism around Michael's story. It's a,

55
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,280
it's a really weird story, especially kind of factoring in like the huge UAP and Black,

56
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,040
about Black program operators, as well as kind of being contacted by the insider and so forth. So,

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,400
one of the things that I wanted to do with this interview, and Joey and I had talked about this

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,320
a lot, is I found in other appearances from Michael in interviews and also Nathan's appearance,

59
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,760
there was still a lot of confusion around Michael's Indonesia case. If I remember correctly, from

60
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,600
Nathan's appearance, there was a lot of confusion for people who don't know these things.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,360
It was Michael's team leader at one point, and he was on the same deployment to Indonesia,

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,280
and he recently was interviewed by Patrick on VETA, and he doesn't believe Michael. He thinks

63
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,320
Michael's lying, and he provided, you know, his testimony, as well as a photograph that he

64
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,960
claims shows Michael, you know, kind of prepping to go into Indonesia with him.

65
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,120
And so, that was something we brought up to Michael as well. There's like a camouflage

66
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,200
match that, you know, was brought up. And the fact of the matter is, I saw some discussion

67
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,640
about this. Nathan was Michael's mission operation, like in the field team leader,

68
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,080
that, you know, a question. I see some people saying like, you know, is he a plankman?

69
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,400
I think Nathan's just a team leader that doesn't like Michael at all. Well, no one really,

70
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,560
honestly, like no one liked Michael in the platoon. The thing that was so crazy for me,

71
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,680
like meeting Michael for the first time in person, I mean, obviously, like over the past year, I've

72
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:33,480
gotten to know him. It was just like a profile picture. Like, I've gotten to know Michael over

73
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,440
the past year, but like meeting him in person, it just struck me that he is not at all the person

74
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,960
that Nathan describes from 2009. I've also had the opportunity to speak with a few other

75
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,640
people from Michael's platoon who knew him back then. And he's just a totally different person

76
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,800
now. You know, he's like a completely remade person. And there's some, you know, he had some

77
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,000
personal struggles after he got out of Marines that you can listen to his total disclosure

78
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,480
interview. And he kind of goes into that. And it just, it just really makes a lot of sense.

79
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,520
So he kind of hit rock bottom and just had this, you know, someone off in his head to like totally

80
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:24,280
change his, his life. And I just, I just had like a totally positive experience. Like, as far as his

81
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:33,480
character and his mannerisms and, you know, just like going out to eat and being polite, so polite

82
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,600
to the, to the staff and just attentive, you know, in conversation and stuff like that.

83
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,560
So that was kind of one of my big takeaways from, from meeting him in person.

84
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:51,800
And so with the, with the, the Nathan's testimony, I found a lot of factual inaccuracies just from

85
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,640
the time that interview was released with Nathan. A both vetted and Nathan were kind of pressing

86
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,200
that this mission happened that night. It was like some secret night mission that didn't,

87
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
that wasn't anything Michael had ever said. He'd always said this was a daytime mission.

88
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,160
They said it, similar to the Arrow historical report this had to do with extraterrestrials

89
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,760
and aliens. It did not. I had a couple other issues. But just like, I agree with some of the

90
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,040
cases, there's some of the claims that Nathan was a little dismissed. Clearly does not like Michael

91
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,040
kind of talking about how Michael would spend hours in the gym and just was a weirdo would

92
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,880
take walks by himself. So for this interview, we really wanted to nail down

93
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,040
a lot. Jim, Jim, thank you so much. I will get to your question in one second.

94
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,840
We really wanted to nail down kind of a lot of the details of kind of Michael's story,

95
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,000
including because one of Nathan's strongest claims is that he was on mission with Michael.

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,160
And there's no way Michael could have gone on this UFO mission. So you'll see this in our

97
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,040
interview, but Michael has stated before he was stationed on the USS Denver in Chow, preparing

98
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,920
officer meals and so forth. And we really tried to nail down the time period that this volunteer

99
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,680
mission where he ended up observing the UFO, he says he observed the UFO happened during one of

100
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,160
his shifts in kind of the Chow Hall. This approach recruited us just to volunteer for this mission.

101
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,280
This wasn't with his normal kind of team leader and fire team. This was a put together rag tag

102
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,240
kind of group of volunteers, especially. And was kind of a off the cuff mission to the point where,

103
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,440
remember, Mike was an M249 saw gunner. And here on this mission, he claims he was handed an M16A4

104
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,560
200 Norwegian Kronath. I know that. Thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Also,

105
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,240
Norway is one of my favorite countries on the earth. I was just in Oslo last September.

106
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,920
But so just kind of ironing out some of those details. And before I continue, you have anything

107
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,880
to add? I think one of the other inconsistencies was like, I think it was stated that like they

108
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,640
saw the UFO from the LZM, but they didn't see anything until they got to the top of the hill.

109
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,440
But yeah, the other questions, I mean, really addressing Nathan's stuff was kind of just a

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,480
small part of the interview. A lot of it was focused on things that I noticed like small

111
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,800
details or kind of gaps in time of his testimony where he might have skipped from one thing and

112
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,480
kind of like went to the next thing. And there, you know, maybe there was like a half hour in

113
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,880
between that kind of is fuzzy, you know, that he has never talked about. And so I tried to

114
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:36,040
identify some of those areas that would help kind of add context to the situation. And we also

115
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,480
talked about the inside. Yes. One of the things I'm really glad Michael talked about in this

116
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,240
interview because he's only kind of mentioned it kind of halfway or just in passing, but he

117
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,800
actually told us the story and did it live. We'll have it in the interview kind of how

118
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,040
he came in contact with the insider because he's just said before, oh, this insider contacted him.

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,960
If we remember to the NPC 2023, that was June 12. June 9th or 10th is when the Daily Mail

120
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,200
article came out. That was about Herrera's story. Pre Greer's NPC 2023, there was actually a three

121
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,520
day kind of closed private event. And that's where Michael first gave his testimony in a

122
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,000
private setting. And it was here that the insider was at this event. And once Michael gave his

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,280
testimony, Michael says that the insider kind of talked to Greer said, I know what this is,

124
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,680
let me try and connect with Michael. And after a little bit of phone tag with Greer and this insider,

125
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,960
they finally connected and this insider invited him out to this location. That is so infamous

126
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,560
now, kind of the most infamous part of Michael's story. Yeah. And for me, so you guys have to

127
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,200
understand when this was all unfolding, I was in direct contact with Michael.

128
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,920
First of all, he told me this insider wanted to meet him. I was like super skeptical.

129
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,280
It sounded like what are the chances you have like a UFO witness, and all of a sudden,

130
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:16,360
someone in the black program is going to wants to meet them. So I was super skeptical, but

131
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,760
I had a phone call with him the day before the meeting. That phone call has since been,

132
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,760
we've published that on the video that you and I did together a few months back. I kind of hear

133
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,080
a clip of that video, but in it you can see like I was given certain details about the location and

134
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,960
timing of that meeting. And ultimately,

135
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:53,800
I was able to obtain some evidence that proved Michael was on a specific helicopter.

136
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,120
And so I was able to track that helicopter without Michael's knowledge. And I could see exactly where

137
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,640
that helicopter went that day. I didn't tell Michael about this, you know, right at the start.

138
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,760
You know, once he got back, I spoke with him and said, you know, I started asking him some questions

139
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,600
and, you know, asked him like what time does he remember them taking off stuff like that. And

140
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:25,160
just like everything was lining up. I also, well, so one thing is at this point, you're

141
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:32,280
fully kind of read in on all of that evidence. Yeah. So, A, thank you so much. That's a cool name.

142
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:39,560
And I appreciate you so much. That's so kind of you. But B, the kind of a, yeah, let me,

143
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,040
let's get to this to kind of, but so a lot of this evidence about that initial meeting was

144
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,240
a helicopter kind of a visit to this location. Joey was able to track down with multiple pieces

145
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,880
of self-confirming data from kind of publicly available flight records. And I like, I don't

146
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,320
know how much I want to say about it. So you tell me some of the pieces that help that. Yeah. I mean,

147
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,760
the reason why it might have to be vague about like the main piece of evidence I use is like

148
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,840
the nature in which it was obtained could kind of compromise certain things. So,

149
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,160
and it's been really frustrating for me, you know, at the time, you know, I eventually revealed to

150
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:33,960
Michael like, hey, I tracked the helicopter and he was like, holy crap. And, you know, at the time,

151
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,320
I felt it was important to reach out to certain people, you know, certain journalists,

152
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:48,440
certain like podcasters, things like that. And just explains him to them that like, look, Michael's

153
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,640
not lying about this insider. Like this meeting happened, you know, like, I can't prove the

154
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,280
insider is who he is. But I know he went to this location that's like, I know where he went.

155
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,440
Herb knows exactly where he went. And it's, it's like a very interesting location. Yeah,

156
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,840
that's what makes things so weird because there's still a lot of like people and still a lot of

157
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,600
valid thoughts about, you know, is this guy disinformation? Like I totally understand that

158
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,720
point of view. It's totally, you know, that's kind of where my mind drifted initially to

159
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,960
puzzle the helicopter. But Joey also, what's the question? The helicopter equals insider.

160
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,120
Okay. Can you name the location, Bernie, Rob? I cannot. That's not my, that's not my location.

161
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,400
So, well, let me, let me address this question here. So I'm not, you're basically kind of saying,

162
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:53,960
like, am I taking evidence of a helicopter to mean that I know the insider's real? No, that's not,

163
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:01,480
that's not it. It's so initially it was the nature in which he took him to this location

164
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:11,640
just said to me that this guy at the very least has to be some sort of high level person to be

165
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:22,200
able to take him where he took him in the nature in which he did that. But now I have, I mean, we have

166
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:32,440
like third party corroboration of this insider from multiple very trusted people. Yeah, it kind

167
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,240
of overlines that. If you guys watched my, my witnesses one video with the story of, and that's

168
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,320
what I'm talking about, Doug Way. And I linked that YouTube video that's kind of talking about Area

169
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:48,680
51, stuff being moved to Doug Way or Weiner. Let me get to that in one second. But thank you so much.

170
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,680
But in that documentary I linked it shows like random citizens pulling up to Doug Way, right,

171
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,360
which is this location is not Doug Way, but random citizens being pulled up to Doug Way,

172
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,360
getting approached by men at arms, being held at gunpoint, being approached by Apache helicopters.

173
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,320
If this was just some random dude taking Michael to this location, they would have been pulled

174
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,200
up on and probably detained because it is a, it's not a Starbucks, right? Like he didn't get

175
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,480
introduced to Starbucks or something like that. Real fast, before we keep talking about that,

176
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,440
Ort Weiner, no, I have not heard back from TV. I will probably not be talking to him again unless

177
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,320
he becomes a, but yeah, I'll probably just let him, I don't, I don't really want to infringe on his

178
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:40,120
privacy anymore. But keep going. Yeah, so when I started reaching out to these different, you

179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:48,520
know, journalists and podcasters who, you know, and I wanted, I just wanted just to say like,

180
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,360
Michael's not lying about this one thing, because I felt like it would just elevate,

181
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,560
you know, kind of the stand that like the base level of trust, instead of just kind of, you know,

182
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,000
just, you know, interviewing him or talking to him without having that information. Now,

183
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:14,200
unfortunately, I had to censor kind of key parts of that evidence. When I was doing these,

184
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,800
these calls with these people, most of them, there's a couple, I did share the full evidence,

185
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:27,160
and they were able to verify it and know the location. Verb here now, at this point, Michael

186
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,800
has, you know, given him the trust to be kind of like fully read in on that. So I'm like, I'm,

187
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,720
I just have such a relief and weight off my shoulders to finally have like someone else,

188
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,680
other than me, just being like, yeah, guys, trust me, who has seen the full picture of,

189
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:54,120
of like evidence of this meeting, who can kind of, you know, talk about it and be like, yeah,

190
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:02,440
I'm not an idiot. And like, do you think the insider has proof that Michael is saying the

191
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,000
truth or the insider just trusts Michael's story? Michael has said that the reason he

192
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
was taken to this location is because the insider told him he would be shown proof to corroborate

193
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,360
his story. And I think that's probably like a pretty fair guess, guess to say that, you know,

194
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,160
some elements of Michael's story he felt were corroborated. Bertie, I do want to tell you this,

195
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,920
this insider, I do not think it's in Taylor. Yeah, so no, just to, just if I could address this

196
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:40,680
question to you, I think 100% the insider knows Michael's telling the truth. Like, like, if the

197
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,000
insider is who he says he is, like, just logically, it doesn't make sense if he wouldn't, if he didn't

198
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,080
believe him. And the whole thing is like, the insider allegedly, you know, is familiar with

199
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,800
these types of operations. And that was, you know, one of the reasons why he wanted to,

200
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,920
you know, build a relationship with Michael. And actually, this was one of the questions I had

201
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:15,160
during the interview with Michael was like, why did he need or want you to kind of have this

202
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,640
relationship and stuff. And so Michael kind of goes into that. And it makes a lot of sense,

203
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,880
in my opinion, you know, kind of why they have this sort of mutual relationship and

204
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,800
what the insider is getting out of it from Michael. And I've struggled and grappled with this,

205
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,720
just Michael's whole story so much. Because if you guys remember the first video I ever did,

206
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,240
a couple months ago, I straight up still told I was extremely skeptical of Michael and didn't,

207
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,240
didn't, kind of didn't believe him over time. And especially talking to Michael, some of the,

208
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,440
some of the confirming elements of just meeting the insider and so forth is so strange to me.

209
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,640
I, I don't know kind of what the, the future of this entails or really the,

210
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,080
the consequence this holds to Michael or even what he saw. I still don't know that I really

211
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,080
would like to know, but it's such a weird story. And I think in this, this interview, which I saw

212
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,600
somebody asking, was it going to be out? I'm trying to add it all right now. So I will get it out this

213
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:17,960
week. But I, I just feel like this week, I know, but the people want to see it, right? I want to

214
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,520
get this video. I'm so excited. But it's just, it's such an interesting story. And I really do

215
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,760
understand it. So I want to touch back to why some people don't believe the Michael story, but

216
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,000
the craft, Bernie, the craft he saw was a pretty, was octagonal, kind of octagonal shape. Yeah,

217
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,160
throw that up there. I mean, this is just a sketch, but yeah, there's, there's some better

218
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,480
drawings and kind of renderings of, of the craft that he described. Oh, we also, sorry,

219
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,760
I don't want to track. I was just going to say, Oh, okay. How much do you trust Steven Greer?

220
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,520
That is a loaded question. How much do I trust Steven Greer right now? Probably a two. How much

221
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,640
do I trust Steven Greer's database and just people who have contacted him? Because most of the

222
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,200
witnesses that I found and so forth just reached out to Greer, not contacted him. High confidence in

223
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,080
a lot of those people. But Greer, I've made it well known. You know, maybe I haven't seen it for

224
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,520
myself. So I don't know if the CE five is, is legit or anything like that. I don't know. I,

225
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,280
that's weird. That's kind of strange to me. But I don't think, I think, I think Greer's got a huge

226
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,000
ego. I think he just kind of wants to possess his own witnesses. For example, Michael talk,

227
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,400
I think this was on the total disclosure podcast. But of course, his story came out through Greer.

228
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,800
He kind of maybe would have gone through different routes if he knew now, but he specifically

229
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,600
mentioned Greer either purposefully or mis-purposefully lying about his case. When he's had the men

230
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,040
of black operators, when they were pulling guns on them, Greer had said overdramatized the story

231
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,440
saying that the men made the Marines kind of get on their knees, turn around, guns pointing back to

232
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,760
their head, like almost a movie level of kind of drama. And so this happens with Michael and who

233
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,080
knows what other people he's talked about. It just kind of stretches the story, but just stretches

234
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:12,760
things a little bit. I think, I think if Greer eased back on the ego a bit and trying to

235
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,400
grift people for thousands of dollars for CE5 stuff, he'd be taken home more seriously.

236
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,160
But he's just an enigma to me, man. I don't know, because if you guys have read the 2001 disclosure

237
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,400
project briefing document, that's what, I think that is really a document, runs it back. It's

238
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,840
fantastic. And so that was in 2001 and 97. Where did he go wrong? That now he's trying to command

239
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,600
Lordship or people who contact him? I don't know. And also, like if you go through the,

240
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,880
if you go through the DPI archive, some of those documents he's uploaded, and I kind of felt guilty

241
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,280
about pulling through some of these, say they're protected by Dr. Client Privileges. Why is he posting

242
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,320
this stuff? It's immoral. It's absolutely immoral that he's doing that. And sometimes I feel bad

243
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,400
looking through that stuff, but I don't know, man. I don't like it. Interesting to know if Michael

244
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,720
has talked about masonry or if you have any thoughts on that. Michael was wearing a masonic pin

245
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,800
and he outs talked to us because of course that's so interesting. He just kind of told us that he

246
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,680
joined masonry because he kind of liked the kind of wealth oriented mindset and joining the group

247
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,240
of people and so forth. So for him, he wasn't a native mason like family wise. I don't even know

248
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,720
how joining masonry works, but he just joined pretty young, I think at 18. At 18? Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,480
But yeah, I mean, he appreciates a lot of the history behind it. And he's talked about,

250
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,280
he's kind of addressed the conspiracy theories and stuff like that and

251
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,360
on kind of other interviews and whatnot. But yeah, I mean, like the wealth aspect,

252
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,320
like we toured his business and it's an incredibly complex organization,

253
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,800
yeah, incredibly impressive. It's an eight figure business just by looking at it.

254
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:04,520
It's about no other panel. Oh, yeah, I don't remember what that was. He addressed that on the

255
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,280
total disclosure. Okay, I need to check it out. I checked where the pity was wearing. Yeah.

256
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,240
But we also talked about Kirkpatrick. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, guys, this is gonna be

257
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,600
really great too. I live in a birdie. If you're in Kentucky, my pops lives in Pendleton. I'm

258
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,240
out there all the time. I love Pendleton. So I'll get to this in one second, but

259
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,560
Arrow. So yeah, Michael did testify to Arrow and in the interview, he talks at length about that.

260
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,040
He testified directly to Kirkpatrick and we'll just give a little details. He, this

261
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,040
Jimmie, is that okay? Can you thank you? And I really appreciate that. The last time,

262
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:54,280
I'm splitting that one with you, man. I don't want anything. I really appreciate that. Thank you

263
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,880
so much, Jimmie. I really appreciate that. That is so kind of you. Seriously, from the bottom of

264
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,400
my heart. But Arrow, so he testified directly to Arrow. There were a couple people in the room.

265
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,680
Michael said that Dr. Kirkpatrick sat lean back with his legs crossed the whole time,

266
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,280
asked three questions about Indonesia, three questions because he testified in April of 2023.

267
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:23,560
So before the NPC 2023 with Greer, he said, Kirkpatrick asked three times the same question.

268
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,120
He said three questions, but they were the same question. He didn't type anything down. He just

269
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,240
had some handwritten notes. After that, Kirkpatrick and Arrow told him they would be following up

270
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,640
and they never did. He never heard from them again. And he was also surprised and pretty

271
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,760
angered when he saw historical report volume one and saw that it was completely

272
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,320
kind of falsifying his testimony to Arrow. You're supposed to like, as a content creator,

273
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,560
you got to like leave teases. You spoiled it. But still, you got to stop. I don't want to.

274
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,000
See, that's what I like about you. You're not like leaning into all the like kind of work.

275
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,760
No, I'm not going to do trailers. No, it's awesome. He thought Kirkpatrick was a total jerk.

276
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,200
So yeah, the question was like, who were the operators? That was like the one thing that he

277
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,040
was focused in on. He didn't ask anything else.

278
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,920
This, for what, yes, I've tried to find that person. That's in the emails. Also,

279
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,640
tried to talk to John Stuart. I've heard some kind of positive and negative things on that

280
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,240
encounter. So I really am trying to get to the bottom of it, as well as the strange connection

281
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,760
to the 1974 Chihuahua Mexico crash retrieval case. I want to cover it. That occurred in

282
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,960
Cuyome, Mexico in 1974. Supposedly a crash, UAP, a disk collided with a small Cessna airplane.

283
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,320
Mexican authorities retrieved the craft. A United States kind of insurgency team killed those people

284
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,240
and took the craft. So that's all I know about that. I know data, anything to back that up now,

285
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,520
but I will cover that case. Bernie, yes, if you've seen the disclosure project and you've seen

286
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,880
witness A or B, I can't remember which, I'm trying to find that person. They said he was Boeing

287
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,160
and locking Skogwork. So I'm trying to track down who that person is. I know his name because it's

288
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,880
actually listed, not redacted in the, in the career files, which is crazy because if you read

289
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,480
the disclosure project, it says AH, that's the name, AH, but in the career witness list, his name

290
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,720
is unredacted. So I won't hide that. If somebody beats me to finding him, fair play. But yeah,

291
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,360
I'm trying to track down that guy. I have a friend of a friend whose father's management

292
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,160
Skogwork's in the 2000s. Bernie, Rob, if you want to talk about UAP, tell him to contact me, please.

293
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,520
Yeah, it's been, it's been so cool to just kind of shadow over

294
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,800
Gerb these past few days. I mean, I think within the span of like a few days, like you've made

295
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,280
like two new contacts, have had conversations with, you know, some, some witnesses.

296
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,520
Like it's incredible. Like the hustle behind here, it's just, it's, it's really cool to see.

297
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,760
Yeah. So I might mention this in another video, but if you guys are watching, I would like to

298
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,840
tell you about something that I found. Another one of Gerr's witnesses I made contact with,

299
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,640
this guy's actually a PhD professor at a university, completely vetted his credentials,

300
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,840
not a first-hand encounter, second-hand encounter. But let me tell you about the second-hand

301
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,680
encounter. I have no more data on it than just speaking to this gentleman the other day.

302
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,880
He's actually a good point of contact. He's actually in Colorado, so I'd like to talk to him

303
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,800
more. But when he was in university for his PhD, are we going to see Michael in documentaries or

304
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,360
hearings? We'll get to that right after this story. While doing, while getting his PhD,

305
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:45,800
one of his professors was an army electrical engineer. And this is Jim, Jim, Jim there.

306
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:56,040
Jim. Wow. Thank you. You were, I'm just wondering, all right. You like $100, $100 that note to Joey.

307
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,480
Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Jim. That's incredible. Thank you so much. But so this guy has a second

308
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,640
hand encounter, right? His professor in university, getting his PhD, used to be in the army core of

309
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,960
electrical engineers. He used to be an electrical engineer in army engineering. So he told me back

310
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,680
in the 50s, early 50s, I think this might be 53 around the time of Kingman. Hey, I'll get to that

311
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,400
in one second. His professor, while a little liquored up at a party one night, said that one

312
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,560
night in the early 50s, in the middle of the night, he was woken up from his bunk. From his bunk,

313
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,520
he was placed in a bust, driven hours to an airstrip, but in a plate with no windows. If you

314
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,520
remember so far, this sounds oddly similar to Arthur Stansel in the Kingman crash. He's put in

315
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,080
this plane, is flown to a place in the middle of the desert, brought into a building in the middle

316
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,120
of the desert where a bunch of strange objects were in like an industrial laboratory. I told

317
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,680
it, figure out how they work. A couple years later, he asked the same professor, the professor

318
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,280
denied that and said, no, it was Russian objects. So that's a really interesting story. That's the

319
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,600
best one I'm talking about. Well, yeah, because he asked, he said, what were they? And he said,

320
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,760
they're not ours. Yeah, he said, they're not ours. Quote, they're not ours. Yeah. And then later on,

321
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,600
he's like, Oh, I didn't mean any Chai or anything when it was Russian. Yeah. So, but he didn't

322
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,880
believe that. No, you don't believe that because why would a PhD in electrical engineering know

323
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,720
that? So that's an interesting story. Three, three D monster. No, sir, I actually have my degree in

324
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:27,880
mechanical engineering. Oh, okay. Sorry about that, guys. Still working on this. In documentaries

325
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,760
or hearings, hearings, I would hope so. I know he's, he's willing to kind of testify of approach

326
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,800
documentaries. I'm not quite sure he's, he's kind of like, he doesn't want to do too many

327
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,840
media appearances. One of the reasons he did this interview is just because like, you know,

328
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,760
we've developed a relationship with Michael over the months, but do you have any other insights?

329
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I mean, there's some stuff that I'm vaguely aware of, but I don't, I don't think it's like public yet.

330
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:06,040
But, you know, one thing I want to just kind of acknowledge as well. I spoke to Ross Colthart,

331
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:13,240
like last year, very early on, he was actually one of the first people I approached to kind of

332
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:22,840
share the evidence that I had. And he finally, you know, he did a Reddit AMA a few months ago,

333
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,920
and acknowledge that he's investigating Michael Herrera's case. And I've known this the whole

334
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:40,120
time. And he also recently in one of his reality check segments, you know, expressed that he finds

335
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:47,880
what he says he likes Michael, and he finds what he says credible. So I just want to like,

336
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:56,040
put that out there, you know, in case you guys missed it. This is a very interesting case. And

337
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,520
I mean, at this point, like, there are a lot of things that I know Michael is 100% telling the

338
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,920
truth about. And, you know, of course, there's a lot of things that I don't have the evidence for.

339
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:17,640
Yeah, plenty. Yeah, like, people call real fast broke Johnny like, where can I find this

340
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,120
custodian filing? Thank you so much. Love you, man. A lot of people call have called Joey Michael's

341
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,480
publicist. But, you know, you don't you do not claim to have all the all the information with

342
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,080
Michael, do you? No, and it's like, you know, there's a lot of times like he in the past,

343
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,240
like he's done interviews. Like, I didn't even know he was doing an interview. And like,

344
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:44,440
I just see it just like all you guys, you know. But, you know, I did reach out to,

345
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:53,480
like I said, Ross, and Richard Dolan, and, you know, like Chris Leto yourself. Yeah,

346
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,520
you know, I reach out to you, Steven Deener, because, you know, I knew that they were interested

347
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,040
in talking to Michael. And I was like, Hey, can I just like, you mind if I can talk to them

348
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,280
ahead of time? And Michael put me in touch with them sometimes or sometimes I'd reach out directly.

349
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,120
And I just be like, look, I'd have a private video call with them and just be like, look,

350
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,760
I just want to share this evidence that I have before you talk to Michael so you can see. But

351
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,560
I'm not like at all part of like, court meeting, his appearances or anything like that. So,

352
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,200
yeah, people, for a long time, people thought I was Michael, because like I was anonymous.

353
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,840
Yeah, but now everybody knows you Joey, this dude's a giant man. He's like, six, five,

354
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,600
six, four, he dwarfs me. He dwarfs Michael. But I'm not like built like you. You're,

355
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,480
you're like Jack. Yes, this is, this is Joey right here. Chris Leto.

356
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,880
I think he's gotten such things. Chris Leto is a wonderful man, a good pilot, a fantastic channel.

357
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,200
There was of course a period of time where, you know, the don't die, don't die. He's all dude,

358
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,600
he's a giant. But there was just a period of time. Do you think NASA and Space Force knows?

359
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Space Force, I'm not quite sure. NASA, NASA's had a weird relationship with, with UAP. If you,

360
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:11,640
if you remember my last video, that kind of NASA back in the 60s and 70s would always claim they

361
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,840
had no kind of interest in studying UAP. But there was a good period of time in 70s, specifically

362
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,120
78 where there were many internal memos with NASA discussing UAP. So I'm not sure to their

363
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,080
extent, like if NASA is involved in black programs and reverse engineering, but NASA is very,

364
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,480
very interesting. Thoughts on Raytheon building UFOs and Antarctica. I've heard nothing about this,

365
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,080
Polaris. If you have anything to share, email me at gmail.com. I'd love to see what you say.

366
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,400
So we'll try to get out of these questions. Get to Patrick's. Okay. Is this, do you think Nathan

367
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:51,720
was put? No, no. He so yeah. So I got in touch with Nathan pretty early on. And he was extremely

368
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,280
gracious with his time, you know, going back and forth with me, you know, just kind of texting and

369
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,920
chatting. And, you know, quickly found out he is exactly what he says he is. I do not at all think

370
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,480
he's like a paid disinformation agent or anything like that. What I kind of got the vibe was he just

371
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,360
never liked Michael. And I got that vibe from every political member I spoke to, because

372
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,920
you have to understand Michael was not part of their group through boot camp, you know, he was

373
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,880
in a different company. He went UA, which is unauthorized absence from his original company.

374
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:37,000
He's upfront about that from his very first, you know, coming forward. Yeah. So, you know,

375
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,080
it was nothing he ever was hiding behind. And, you know, people accused him of like trying to hide that.

376
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:49,000
But so he got transferred to Nathan's company prior to that deployment to Indonesia.

377
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,360
And so all of those guys looked at him and they just think he's like a loser because, you know,

378
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,240
they find out he went UA and, you know, they were bullying him and he just kind of leaned

379
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,680
into it and kind of screwed with them back. And so none of them liked it. So that's what I recognize

380
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,280
for Nathan. And I mean, if you can put yourself in Nathan's shoes and, you know, the guy that you

381
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:17,880
remember being strange is coming forward with like his really extraordinary claims. And he was his

382
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:26,040
team leader, you know, at, you know, during that deployment. But, you know, I, so like, I don't

383
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:34,200
have a military background. So like, I, the, you know, if Michael has said from, from his first,

384
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,840
you know, testimony that the mission he was on was a volunteer pick of people from different

385
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,400
squads. And I think he even said different platoons because there are multiple platoons on the ship.

386
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:53,080
And so from day one, his testimony has always been that he did not deploy with his assigned

387
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:01,240
squad. So Nathan was never a part of Michael's testimony. And it's just kind of silly that like

388
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,880
why would Michael, like if Michael was making this up, why would he make up a

389
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,760
fake mission about a UFO? But then after, you know, 14 years of thinking about it and saying,

390
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,400
I'm going to come forward, also decide to lie about the real mission he did with Nathan. That part

391
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,440
has always bothered me. It just makes no sense. Because literally the only thing that puts Nathan's

392
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,640
testimony against Michael is Michael's denial of him going on a mission with him. So he could have

393
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,680
easily just said, yeah, I did two missions. I did one with a volunteer group that, you know,

394
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:46,760
saw the UAP. And then I did another regular mission with my team leader. And we didn't see

395
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,000
anything on that one. So I'm not sure if there was a second part to that question. We'll explore

396
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,360
through a couple of these. We'll be Milo. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. If you've got

397
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,240
any questions, I will get to them right away. Sorry, we're trying to scroll through these questions.

398
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,800
And I see you anonymous. What do you mean? Let us let us know what you think. Why are you staying

399
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,080
in a trust we grow with million claims? No evidence, because I understand how you feel.

400
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,560
Like here, how you think, why is that that some things are made not made public yet? I like to

401
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,880
think back to David Rush saying a program for reverse engineering and so forth, feudalistic

402
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,040
dominance. And just I still think that over time, there's a lot more interesting parallels to be

403
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,280
drawn to somewhat of a hidden cold war for decades between adversaries and so forth,

404
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,200
kind of a race to understand this technology thoughts on Kirk Patrick's new position.

405
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,600
DOE influence all the time. I do not like Kirk Patrick at all. And I think his interview with

406
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,360
Green Street was pretty funny how part two was just kind of changed to be solely discussing the

407
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,840
2018 Skinwalker Braving. So with the Raytheon stuff, I don't know. I don't know what I think

408
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,000
about Eric Hecker. Some of his claims, I know I'm talking about Michael here and discussing

409
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,560
how I find his claims interesting. The neutrino detector, that's a little bit hard to believe

410
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:08,200
that the neutrino detector is like a kind of like a weather weapon. I need I need to do more

411
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,640
study than to like have a and just to touch on the why things aren't public yet. I mean,

412
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:20,760
the group that Michael is working with, with this insider, their pro disclosure,

413
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,040
like this was the whole reason they connected with Michael. They have things going on that

414
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,800
they're trying to, you know, I think if you guys back out and kind of look at disclosure as a whole,

415
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,320
like there's multiple groups of people trying to push disclosure forward from different angles.

416
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,080
You know, you've got the legislation side of things. You have kind of, you know,

417
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,680
intelligence community insiders who weren't read into the program, but kind of have an idea that

418
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,360
there's something going on and they're kind of pushing things forward to try to get things.

419
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:59,320
And you have people in the program who just can't become public about it because they have,

420
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:06,040
you know, families and they're at risk. And I think what we're hearing not just from Michael,

421
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:13,000
but from other sources is that there needs to be more kind of whistleblower protection.

422
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,720
Yeah. Something I experienced outright with TB in it, this is kind of aligns with the whistleblower

423
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,040
protection is part of the reason I don't think he wanted to come forward with career is, you know,

424
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,120
having his name public, he will still lose his pension completely. You guys got a family to

425
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,200
provide for and so forth, but his pension will be completely gone, never get another job in

426
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,320
government. So more whistleblower protection seem to be in place and kind of liquid how

427
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,920
some whistleblowers have been treated a little bit. Do you think the next aero boss,

428
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,240
do you think the next aero boss will be different? Probably not. I think aero is rotten from the

429
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,120
inside out then, but I'd love to be proven wrong. I think there needs to be a large internal

430
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:57,080
investigation into aero. Let's see what, thank you so much Broke Johnny Live. That's your second

431
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,960
cash donation. I really appreciate you. We do not need any person to film these in 4K.

432
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah, footage is a weird one to me because as we saw on vetted yesterday, there was that dude at

433
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:12,440
Moopon who presented that crash retrieval photo. And it's just like, footage is a little,

434
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,560
is really hard to kind of authenticate or completely disprove. And at this point for me,

435
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,040
like in my private research, just studying footage is not enough. That's why I try and

436
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,200
talk to all these people. I really just want to speak to people and so forth.

437
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,960
I'm not, thank you for your channel. Thank you so much first, last, I appreciate you.

438
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,880
I want to talk to Anonymous. Yeah, I definitely understand that point of view because there's

439
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,000
a lot of trust me bro stuff with people like Jeremy Corbell. I think with this evidence where

440
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,960
Michael was taken, I think that Joey can't share it because Michael- Well, it would just

441
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,920
compromise the insider. Totally compromise. But like, I totally understand the sentiment and

442
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,560
like, I just, I had a decision. Do I just not say anything publicly, even though I know it's true?

443
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,840
Or what I came up with was a compromise. I said, well, let me reach out to different people who,

444
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,760
you know, the community mostly trusts, you know, different kind of people in the community,

445
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,040
podcasters, journalists and things like that and share that evidence with them. And then they can,

446
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:28,200
you know, if they think I'm full of baloney, they can call me out on it and shut me down, you know.

447
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:36,920
What I didn't expect was a lot of them kind of wanted to kind of continue their investigation

448
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:44,200
privately and not just like come forward and stuff like that. But at the end of the day,

449
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:52,360
I totally respect and understand the majority of you guys feeling like, you know, this,

450
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,600
you just kind of want to set this aside because that evidence isn't-

451
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,920
That's a good question to touch on too. Very good question.

452
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:06,840
Why would it compromise the insider? Because this, you know, these guys have kind of a regular job

453
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,720
as well, right? They're like, it's not just like the Black program stuff that they do,

454
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,240
they have kind of a regular job that they do. And so the location would kind of indicate

455
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:27,080
the people that work there, essentially, you know. So that's why. Well, there's another reason.

456
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,200
So you're working. It's having positive vibes. Thank you, brother. Not to trust me, bro.

457
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,680
Anon, I totally understand your sentiment, man. Like, I would love for Michael to talk about this.

458
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,280
I'd love for this thing insider to be public, but unfortunately, I don't get to call the shots

459
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,960
there. I'm just trying to kind of study this case as best as I can. But, you know, I completely

460
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,160
understand why it's frustrating, especially in a subject where a lot of people make claims

461
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,520
and don't really touch on it. Aztec. Aztec's a really good case I really want to cover.

462
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,400
So if you guys remember to, if you guys remember when I did my Wilson Davis

463
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,280
memo, James, the guy who actually beat the Wilson Davis memo, I become friends with him. He's a

464
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,360
wonderful man, a great person, and he is strongly of the mind that Aztec is a hoax. So I really want

465
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,480
to speak to him and why he does that. Majed Brazil, I really want to cover that too. MacMade

466
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,000
Studios has a terrific kind of a, have you seen that? It's a blender. It's like a recreation of

467
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:37,160
a grass retreat event. MacMade Studios. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's super good. It's awesome. Yeah,

468
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:45,480
it is really good. But yeah, I wish more people would be public, man. Have you verified the guy

469
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:53,080
that- Yes, this is the second part of your question, Patrick, that I still talk. You know, I don't

470
00:46:53,080 --> 00:47:00,840
want to, I don't want to go too far into this because I don't, yeah, I don't know how much

471
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:12,680
everyone's comfortable. So to a certain extent, I'll say that I have verified the person who sent

472
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:21,000
the text, kind of claiming that, so the context is Michael sent a, actually called,

473
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,000
actually this is good to explain because people don't know the context. So Michael called one of

474
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,840
the five Marines who witnessed this event with him to see if they'd be willing to kind of come

475
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:45,480
forward with him and, you know, be public. And he left a message and the guy replied later,

476
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,360
I think it was several days later, with the text message. And that's why, so like I posted the

477
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,840
text message. I had seen the message like months and months prior and I talked to Michael about it.

478
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,600
I was like, hey, do you think I can post the actual screenshot of the message? And I censored out like

479
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,520
the messages above and people were like, why did, you know, we want to see what was asked and all

480
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,400
that. The reason why it was censored is the text messages involved were from like weeks prior,

481
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:18,920
months prior. Michael had called him, left the message, but then this person responded via text.

482
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,480
So hopefully that kind of explains it a little bit more. But yeah, I'll just leave it there for

483
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,160
now because, you know, like Michael says, like none of the guys that he witnessed this with

484
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,320
want anything to do with this, you know, like you've got to remember like they all signed NDAs

485
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:46,520
threatening their lives and jail time and all of that. And Michael kind of, you know, violated

486
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,520
that NDA by coming forward. So I don't want to do anything at all to, you know, kind of

487
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,480
make them upset. And it's just something I'm kind of setting aside for now.

488
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,200
Any noticeable or notable case in Louisiana probably closest, I know, is Cape to Rodeau

489
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,840
1941. And that's a really interesting case. Let's try to get some of these thoughts on

490
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,920
Brandon Fugle and Travis Taylor. I don't have many thoughts or opinions on Brandon Fugle,

491
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,120
to be honest. I do think it's kind of weird. He never followed up with a green street about the

492
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,720
about the Shunker Patrick thing. But I don't have many thoughts or Travis Taylor is the

493
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,120
dude on Skinwalker Ranch, right? Travis Taylor, yeah. I don't know. I've never watched Skinwalker

494
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,200
Ranch. Any TV show, whether it's Ghost Hunters or any reality show. I mean, he's had other

495
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,960
because he has a PhD then. Yeah, he's been involved with UAT.

496
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,520
Tell us now, there's plans are strange. Joel says we are too. I'm really interested in Tums

497
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:49,160
lately. An interesting kind of piece on that. I don't think it's in print anymore as UFO highway

498
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,960
book. If you get in contact with me, I'll send that to you because it's really interesting.

499
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,240
I don't want to be very confused about the Nazca bodies. There's a website on this,

500
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:05,480
I want you to check out. Let me pull that up. Sorry, let me pull this up. If you're watching,

501
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:16,440
if you're interested in the bodies, it's called Crap. It's called alien-alien-project.com and you

502
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,160
can look at the 3D scans of all the bodies and that's just a really cool thing to look at. I don't

503
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,080
really have an opinion on them right now because I haven't studied too much, but it's very strange.

504
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:32,200
Ryan Roberts, 5K, USD announced who it is. I don't know who it is and so I cannot do that.

505
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,600
Well, where do you think the huge unmovable object that UFO Ross says,

506
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:46,760
I have heard rumors that this is Pine Gap Australia and I think that that's

507
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,840
probably like a pretty interesting place. I know TV said Seoul, South Korea and I know

508
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:59,000
there was a pretty good Reddit investigation in South Korea, but I'm not 100% sure if that's

509
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,160
accurate. Recommendations, I don't really dig into this. Yes, dude, just read into tons of

510
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,440
documents. That's all I can say. The way I started this was I'm just a normal dude. I'm kind of an

511
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,320
idiot. I like to get punched in the face for fun. I just read a lot. Speaking of jujitsu.

512
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,480
Yeah, I try and catalog everything I can do. My drink and sauce by the bottle, I do not. Soy

513
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:28,280
sauce. This is kombucha. It's really good, by the way. Yes, sir, I would love to.

514
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,240
Can we get you cloned, dude? No, I'm not giving you my DNA. That'd be weird. It'd probably be pretty

515
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,960
annoying to hang out with the clone of me. I'm sorry, guys. I'm trying to look through.

516
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,760
Yeah, Xavier, that good shout on Travis Taylor. Yeah, I thought UAP Task Force, he was on UAP

517
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,240
Task Force. Yeah, I completely agree with that. That's something that TV commented on in his emails.

518
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,200
Specifically, University Affiliated Research Centers. I still need to do some digging there,

519
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,400
but I think that there's some interesting things there. Taylor was also on UAP-TF. Yeah, I'm sorry,

520
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:07,960
I didn't mention that, guys. Thanks, both of you, for bringing that up. I like, of course,

521
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,320
not something that's pretty interesting, but there's, of course, some controversy there.

522
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,200
I like Monop AFD. I like nuclear-based incursion. One of my favorite stories is Bob Jacobs. Of

523
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:23,480
course, that's a dummy warhead, but you're familiar with Bob Jacobs, right? I love that story. Jesus,

524
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:30,520
all this. Okay, come on, man. Anyone bring up those new move-on photos? Yeah, we kind of touched

525
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:37,160
on a little bit. The photos are interesting, of course, but I don't know what to say. It's just

526
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,960
a photo, and I think the dude on the live just wanted to flash it up for a second and bring it

527
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,880
down. I don't know. It's a weird photo. I can't really say anything more than a strange

528
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,840
photo. Yeah, this is really interesting. Blue, Elizondo, and Steven G. Bean are odds with each

529
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,800
other. Gray said that a few thousand four-in-init tic-tacs are man-made ARBs and calls Lou a

530
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:03,720
disinformation agent. Lou has basically called Gray a fraud. So the whole thing with Green

531
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,080
Street and Lou, I think you guys will probably think is super interesting. I find that super

532
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:15,800
interesting. There is a strange absence of documents around Lou, and they tip, but I think

533
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,360
Lou is a fantastic person, but he seems like he wants disclosure, and I'm actually kind of

534
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:30,600
excited for his book. Yeah, you're going to look good. Okay, hey, this is a good point, man.

535
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,760
So what we kind of talked about earlier, when I brought up the 1974 Chihuahua incident,

536
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,840
this is in Kaio-Mei, the same region where sploxide occurs. So we're talking about the

537
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,680
Sentinels of Atheropoeia. Yeah, Sentinels of Atheropoeia 2004, JSA. The insider is kind of

538
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:54,280
having produced and is going through the officer review right now. So it takes place in this.

539
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:00,120
So I have a little conspiracy theory that I'm trying to look through that this 1974 Kaio-Mei

540
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:06,280
case with the American operators taking down the Mexican military retrieval team is the case

541
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,600
referenced in Sentinels of Atheropoeia. I need to keep looking at that, but that's something I

542
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,280
need to keep going through. Has my course to you? Yeah, he's talked about this kind of a lot

543
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,720
in terms of, he said his father has been threatened, and he says he's seen curious

544
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:29,560
kind of flyovers of helicopters almost circling strafing his place of work and so forth.

545
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,840
You want to touch on that before I get to this next question? Oh, no, that's all right. All right,

546
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,520
contact, arrival, or interstellar. That's a tough question, man, but I got to go with interstellar.

547
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,840
Time and no time for caution, or no time for caution is one of the best film songs of all time.

548
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,480
You've seen interstellar. Yeah, I would say interstellar too. Yeah, the scores.

549
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,160
Interstellar is a fan. All of these are great movies, especially contact. That's

550
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,800
severely underrated with Joni Foster. You've seen that, right? I don't think I have actually, man.

551
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:04,280
You got to see it. Yeah. That's any idea why JSOC is coming up in here. Yes, because if this

552
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,920
insider is telling the truth, and he's not just a disinfo guy, and he's trying to disseminate

553
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:14,120
information through Sentinels of Ether, there's a reason why he's bringing up JSOC. I just don't

554
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:22,040
understand the Sentinels of Ether. No, the disinfo angle with Michael. I also don't get the...

555
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,520
Like, what's the logic, guys? Like, tell me what the logic is. Like, Michael came forward,

556
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,960
most people didn't believe him, and so why would there be a... Like, what's the agenda? I don't

557
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:39,400
get it. You know, like, I just don't understand. And I mean, at this point, I'm like so confident

558
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:46,200
that this guy is who he says he is for a variety of reasons. I mean, I don't have, like, definitive

559
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:52,360
proof, because that would be me going through that black side and seeing it for myself. And

560
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,200
obviously, I didn't do that. So, like, I'm like a couple steps removed from that, I guess.

561
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,080
And Django. That's love, man. And that's a really cute... Do you see that?

562
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,200
Oh, my God. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.

563
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,360
If not... If non-disclosure, if non-human intelligence exists, do you think government

564
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,200
wouldn't officially say, no, I don't? I don't know how many elements in government officially

565
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,440
know this. I'd like to look back to the early 1950s. This is something I just talked about in

566
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:24,360
the infographics video, too, within Truman and Eisenhower, and kind of the heavy possibility of

567
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,240
U.S. government elements losing track of the UAP situation at that time. If we look back to the

568
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:35,080
40s and 50s, you have scientists like Herman Auberth and so forth who you're talking and actually

569
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,360
making flight measurements and estimates of UAP flight characteristics. So, back at this time,

570
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,400
it was pretty well thought out to be non-human intelligence and flying saucers and so forth.

571
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,320
So, I don't think this is going to be done by the people. By the people, hopefully, and I hope

572
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,400
this, people in programs that Grush has talked about, some of his 40 witnesses, these people need

573
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:03,880
to start to test apart. Yeah. It's kind of an annoying bit of silence. What do you think of

574
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,080
Charles Hall? That name sounds familiar, but I can't remember. Do you know Charles Hall?

575
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:15,240
So, Julian Grocks, if you can tell me, best favorite UFO photo, my profile picture, 2006

576
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,520
or 2007, Wisconsin, there's a series of two of them. I love this image. I look at it just

577
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,880
something that kind of makes me feel a little scared inside. What do you say? I don't really

578
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,560
have a favorite, but I can respect why you feel like that's really compelling.

579
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:38,600
It's a great series of images that I'll provide on my community notes. There's a good kind of story

580
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:44,040
in the summary of the people who took the photos and so forth, and there's two cases of it.

581
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,160
Really interesting. Would you like to hear your research on value authority?

582
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,920
Somebody was talking about Valiant Thor in the Twitter space the other day. That's when I

583
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,640
messaged you and I said, these guys are talking about value authority. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

584
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,600
I first heard about that. I think it was Jason Sands. It was Sands? Yeah, he was on a live. He was

585
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,720
on an X space, rather. Okay, Valiant Thor, for any of you who don't know, Valiant Thor is like a

586
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:11,720
supposed Venusian extraterrestrial that came down in the, I think Eisenhower administration

587
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,120
and basically worked in the Pentagon. I first heard about this on a podcast called Mysterious

588
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,720
Universe. It's a really good podcast. It's a little tongue-in-cheeked, a little silly. If any of

589
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:25,720
you guys have heard that, I absolutely love that podcast. But that story is a bit, I mean, I have

590
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,840
no confirming evidence or things to disprove the story, but I find it a little strange that

591
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:37,560
basically an uncanny valley type human is working in the Pentagon, but I don't know. I don't have

592
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:43,880
anything to, I don't have anything to debunk that story, but I do find it a little strange.

593
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:51,400
Let's keep seeing. I do agree with what DeLaunch had on Steve's pot about Valiant Thor. I don't

594
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:58,600
know what he said, so if you know what he said, please let me know. Ross Holt Hart said it is

595
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:07,400
a psionic. Yeah, so the psionic in the, I think that was in the AMA, you know, like what's one

596
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,920
word everyone should be looking into to kind of push things forward or learn more about what's

597
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:21,080
going on. He said psionic. And from my perspective, that is a 100% direct reference to Michael's

598
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:28,520
testimony, you know, relaying information from the insider. Okay, that's my opinion.

599
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:39,240
And I'll just repeat that Ross is actively investigating Michael's case and finds it incredible.

600
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,280
I'll say that I have not talked to Ross, especially about Michael. So like, I can't add

601
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,800
anything there. I would love to speak to Ross, but no, like, I know you've talked to Ross, but I have

602
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:55,080
not. Yeah, I've not spoken to Ross. So I mean, I could be wrong, but like that word for me, the

603
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,520
first, I never heard psionic until Michael brought it up. And that was like a big part of, you know,

604
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,280
the whole, the whole thing with, I think I first heard about like psionic stuff back in like 20,

605
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,000
I can't remember the 2020s when those supposed A tip slides leaked from Chris Mellon's personal

606
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,240
website. I think it's slide nine, which talks like what's considered like the phenomenon is not

607
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,280
considered quantum physics and talk about kind of a consciousness affecting of being approximately

608
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,960
the UAP and so forth. So that is super, super interesting. I don't know because, you know,

609
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,160
I'm not a psychic. If I was, I'd make better YouTube videos, but I'm not a psychic. I don't

610
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,000
know anybody not psychic. So that of course is one of the toughest things for me to wrap my head

611
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,880
around. What soft disclosure points? I don't know because you have close encounters of the third

612
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,680
kind and you have a really weird, you have a lot of parallels to real life, like that eccentric

613
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:50,040
French scientist who is basically a movie analog analog to a Jacques Valais and the J. Allen,

614
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,320
Heineck type scientists. So I don't know, but that I'd be interested to find out. I agree.

615
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,720
Jay Sock was also mentioned in the article exposing the OGA. Yes, the OGA is something I'm

616
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,880
trying to invent investigate right now as we speak. I think that's so interesting. There's a couple

617
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,400
guys I'm talking to that have some poignant points on OGA and my car wolf, the former head and so

618
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,120
forth. So that'd be interesting. All right. What does this say? So David Gruss has confirmed that

619
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:19,160
deep state is real thoughts on the legitimacy of the USA government. Democracy is fake. I definitely

620
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:24,760
think there is a program that studies reverse engineering. We're like looking around the camera

621
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:29,000
questions to see the questions. At least from everything I've studied, I'd like to support

622
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,560
the thesis that there is evidence that there is a crash retrieval in reverse engineering

623
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:39,720
project that is not necessarily run by USG elements with oversight. Yeah. I mean, this stuff,

624
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:47,160
this stuff's so crazy, guys. Like I totally understand that. I mean, it's, it's, I don't know.

625
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:54,760
It's, I really don't know. It's just recalculation. Wait, but the text message from his bussy who

626
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:05,320
tells him he isn't too deep. I think your comments more common. Okay, let's keep going through.

627
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,080
I don't know if I consider her at this info, but the play devil's advocate would definitely

628
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,640
be value in elevating false whistleblowers to discredit people indirectly the whole prospect.

629
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,520
Yeah, totally agree. And I didn't think at the 2023, there's some kind of a little bit of false

630
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:27,640
whistleblowers and so forth. Well, one, one thing I don't understand, like people kind of

631
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,160
call this a Dodie Benowitz situation. And the thing I don't understand about that at all is,

632
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:40,760
you know, Benowitz didn't have the same type of experience that Herrera did. Benowitz intercepted

633
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,040
communications, if I'm correct. Yeah, I think it was near Mallory. No, no, that's Kenneth Arnold

634
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:51,240
near a kind of like a plateau. He thought he was intercepting like communication between

635
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:59,080
NHI and so Dodie came in and like supported that idea and like egged it on. This is like the

636
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:08,280
opposite. Like Michael saw anti gravity craft. It flew off. There's like no mistaking what his

637
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:15,240
testimony is from his perspective. So it makes no sense if Michael was making this up.

638
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:20,920
How could an insider come in and like egg him on about it being like, Oh, yeah, I saw the operation

639
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:27,320
you came, you stumbled upon. If Michael knows he's making it up, you would know the insider is lying

640
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:32,440
to him about, you know, knowing what operation he stumbled upon. So I just, I just don't even see the

641
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:38,360
logic of how that would work. So I kind of find that that comparison a little silly. Yeah, I need

642
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,960
to let's let's scroll keep going through. Sorry, we're trying to get through all these whack-a-mechs.

643
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,200
Much love, brother. Thank you. What do you think about the idea of agreements with NHI?

644
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,560
It's really interesting. David Gresh has commented on that as pretty much fact.

645
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,720
One of the things that I remember is I think it's 1954, Holloman Air Force based landing

646
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,040
with Eisenhower coming down to contact extra terrestrials and making some agreement with

647
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,760
them. There's stories that this is to allow extra terrestrials to do abductions and so forth.

648
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:13,320
And Greer has some interesting whistleblowers in his log that talked about observing like the 54

649
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,400
Holloman landing, what these agreements could be, why these agreements are with people that live in

650
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,800
this continent and not others, or if Russia is going to come out and say that Russia, China has

651
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,360
their own agreements. I don't know. I find it really interesting, but I struggle a lot to find out,

652
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:36,120
to think what those agreements could be. Why would an NHI, why would a NHI species need to

653
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:41,400
make agreements with humans? Yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of speculation. I really don't know.

654
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,280
Yeah, speculation. And there's some pretty interesting stories around there, but I really

655
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,640
hope we can get to the bottom of that or hear more from Gresh because I don't know.

656
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:55,720
I mean, he alluded to it. No, no, no. He said in a Ross Bullard interview in the first one,

657
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:01,320
the News Nation one, Ross says something like an agreement has been made with NHI and Gresh says,

658
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:07,720
yeah. So I don't know. Wait, is that the Joey? Yes, this is the Joey, man. This is Joey. It's not

659
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,000
my name. I mean, my name's not Joey, but I am Joey. It's not my name.

660
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,920
Quitter. Yeah, I struggle with this every day. The abduction, psionic ET communication is the

661
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:26,520
hardest part for me to wrap my head around. Yeah, and honestly, guys, I seriously think I've got

662
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,560
this cognitive dissonance sometimes when I'm investigating this case, and I focus in on the

663
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:38,040
tangible stuff that, you know, is in my kind of reality of what the real world is like. And so

664
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:43,640
I focus on the military stuff, the operation and things like that. And I kind of like take

665
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:51,720
a bigger, crazy picture of what Michael's claiming and just set it aside. Because like,

666
01:05:51,720 --> 01:06:01,160
it's such a wild change for like how I understand what works, that it's hard for me to really accept

667
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,440
it. Yeah, it's something like I'm actively studying to learn more about. But, you know, for

668
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,760
somebody with an engineering background who's really interested in craft,

669
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,160
pressure, trivose, more so tangible stuff, it's really difficult for me to understand, especially

670
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,800
because, you know, I've had no like personal experiences with any sort of psychicness.

671
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,480
Laxative pain is out of play on Max pain. Thank you so much. Just dropping the Max pain right in

672
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:33,640
there. Oh, hey, that was a good game. Max pain three is going on. I played the OG Max pain

673
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,880
for those kind of slow and the activist GTA. I'll check that out tonight, man. Fose 1997. I

674
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:47,400
really appreciate you brother. Thoughts on Ashton and the NH three 70 videos. I don't know much.

675
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,840
I try to stay out of that because that seems like a really big kind of a rabbit hole. I have heard

676
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:59,800
many people say that those are debunked, but I really don't know, man. I try to say out of that.

677
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,600
I remember when that video was released, I was like, holy crap, that's really cool. I really don't

678
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:14,520
know much to be honest. What about you? Yeah, I mean, it's, it seems pretty compelling that they're

679
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:25,480
hoaxed. However, and I don't really like Ashton's reaction to a lot of really logical kind of

680
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:31,160
presentations like the raw the raw photos finding the original photographer took the raw photos of

681
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:38,360
the clouds and the sequence and he's kind of, you know, comebacks to those are relatively weak and

682
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:44,440
kind of emotional reactions. However, there are certain things that I find interesting

683
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:56,760
about the context of the way the videos were put together, I guess, and it makes me almost

684
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:05,480
wonder if maybe they are hoaxed, but maybe they're hoaxed by a high level government

685
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,800
not just a senior person, not just like a random dude like in his basement, but like maybe this was

686
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:19,800
a kind of official like project to put this out for some sort of reason because there's

687
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,880
there's things about the satellite, like the specific satellite that was, you know, supposedly

688
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:30,200
taking images that like how would the person know this within the timeframe and just like the

689
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,240
alignment of a lot of different things. And so there's a lot of, I haven't gone too deep into

690
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:42,040
it, I've really just focused on Herrera's case, but and I don't like how Ashton is handling

691
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,160
a lot of the criticisms and stuff, but there's still like a little piece there that I do find

692
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:54,520
interesting. Matt Ford announced that maybe the OGA has changed recently. Yeah, I remember

693
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,360
when that Daily Mail article about the OGA came out too, there seemed to be a lot of

694
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,280
kind of changes from the internet archive on kind of the flow of information from how to access the

695
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:07,480
OGA. The OGA is super interesting. Sorry, just trying to scroll through some of the questions.

696
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:14,440
Should I still report it to move on? Edward, tell me, man. Send me an email. I want to hear

697
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,560
about it. You might be good about gmail.com, gata scamming. I want to hear about your experience,

698
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,400
man. That sounds incredible. This is a great question. What are your opinions on, I think

699
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:27,160
that was a really bad idea for you to come down with on Twitter. Yeah, unfortunately, and I think

700
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:37,400
part of the thing that I think Mr. Sands made as a kind of mistake was going too much into being

701
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:43,320
too generous with providing his speculative thoughts on different questions that were totally

702
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:52,440
unrelated to his direct experience of what his encounter and his job. Because what happens is

703
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:58,680
now people get that sound bite and they think he's speaking that from a firsthand perspective

704
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:05,880
and it just kind of muddies the water. One thing that's interesting that I think we can talk about

705
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:12,680
regarding Sands, so we actually had another meeting yesterday with Michael and another individual

706
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,800
who was kind of behind the scenes. He's someone in the intelligence community,

707
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:27,480
someone I've been speaking to for a while, and he kind of vouched for the fact that Jason Sands

708
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:32,600
was participating in the UAP Task Force Forum. So there was some, you know, that you guys probably

709
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:38,920
remember that argument about, you know, Sands said he was part of the UAP Task Force and

710
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,920
but then he's like, well, I mean the forum and people kind of flipped out about that.

711
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:53,160
But from what this IC person that we saw yesterday kind of explained to us was like,

712
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:58,920
that's kind of how it was. There was like the UAP Task Force Forum was kind of this,

713
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:05,880
it's essentially like a collaborative platform that's behind, you know, a top secret clearance,

714
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:12,120
but it's accessible to a wide range of intelligence community individuals. And so what was happening

715
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:18,040
was people who were officially part of the UAP Task Force might reach out to someone in the

716
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:23,640
NGA or something and be like, oh, have you guys seen this or that? And like, you know,

717
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,760
people who had a personal interest in UAP could just jump in there and kind of like be like,

718
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,800
on the side, like do a little bit of research and like, you know, give it to the task force.

719
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:40,200
And so it was kind of, you know, the way I kind of understand it is like, you kind of felt like

720
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,200
you were part of the UAP Task Force if you were just part of that group. It's kind of like if

721
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,200
you're on like a discord chat, you would say like, oh yeah, I'm part of that group. Yeah. You know,

722
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:53,160
if you're, you know, so the way, yeah, the way we heard is you participated in kind of this forum,

723
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,880
so forth, kind of contributed to the UAP Task Force. And that's when he told the story.

724
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,720
And kind of a lot of really interesting people kind of find Sam's credible or think he's just

725
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,360
a fantastic person. They have wonderful things to say. Yeah. I mean, like his character alone,

726
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:15,800
I've only heard very positive things about his character. So I think, I think it's just kind

727
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:21,560
of the way he decided to come forward, just had him come forward on wrong foot. And yeah. And

728
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:27,560
again, like for me personally, I feel like it's important for whistleblowers, especially when

729
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:33,800
they first come forward, stick to your direct experiences, let people know what you're speculating.

730
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:38,920
Yeah. Or just be like, you know, I don't want to go there. Like just to cement in people's minds,

731
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,840
like this is their direct experience. Sorry, you're trying to like hammer through all these

732
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,080
questions. And I'm not going to be standing on. That's kind of, that's what we did with our Michael.

733
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:52,600
How much from, what time do you want to go to? Okay, we'll go to 5.20. So eight minutes, guys,

734
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,000
then we got to hop off, right? Yeah. So we'll do just a question of them. But for an interview with

735
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,760
Michael, we try to make sure that, that every time he was speculating about something, he made

736
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,960
it clear, just because we want to kind of hammer down his case from his words. So let's keep,

737
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,400
let's get through these. We'll stay on for a little bit more. Trollmama, thank you so much.

738
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:17,080
And I like that little beaver, beaver running through. I really appreciate you. Above Black

739
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:21,480
by Dan Sherman, I was told to read this yesterday. So I'm going to be reading that and kind of,

740
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,080
I'll check it and let you know what I think. I think that's my next read. Please look into

741
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:30,440
Jason Thans a little deeper. Yes. I'm currently trying to get in contact with Sans to speak to

742
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:36,120
him. I really want to talk to him. I think this was a response to the question on the guy saying

743
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,960
he was playing devil's advocate about Michael and the fake purposeful disinformation. I don't

744
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,800
think necessarily an example of elevated pulse was born. Yeah, suspicious about Jason Sans,

745
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,840
especially with how he came forward, right? Like this dude pops up on a Twitter space.

746
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:56,040
And especially when he kind of has an idea and runs with it. So, you know, I really wish our

747
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:01,720
first introduction with him was the James Fox, James Fox interview. Yeah, or like just some

748
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,760
other interview thoughts on Wagan. Wagan's awesome. Although he won't try to talk to him. I don't

749
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:14,440
think he wants to do more interviews. I've tried to contact him on massive, multiple platforms.

750
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,440
Sorry. You can't discredit the legitimate witnesses and whistleblowers coming down the pipe. You can

751
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,960
preemptively discredit the idea of a UFO whistleblower. If you're talking about Sans there,

752
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,520
I'm not shutting down Sans. I kind of need to talk to him personally before I can form a full

753
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,320
opinion, just because of how strange his coming out was on Twitter and so forth. There's a lot

754
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,480
of messiness there and a lot of murky waters. Because I know there's been a lot of discussion

755
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:40,760
around him and so forth. Is there any evidence at all for abductions being real? I don't know.

756
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,000
We were talking about the Travis Walton case today and neither of us really know what to think

757
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,160
about that. I don't know. I try and stay a little away from abductions a little bit,

758
01:14:51,160 --> 01:15:02,600
because I know it's pretty murky. Why assuming NHI is a biological life form,

759
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,520
why would anything more powerful than us? I don't know. It's an interesting question.

760
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,920
Especially so many hypotheses as to why NHI are here and interacting or not interacting with us

761
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:19,800
is new hypothesis for one. That's a great question. It looks like anonymous is leaving

762
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:25,800
us gang. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry I disappointed you, dude. Without disclosing names or locations,

763
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:33,720
can Joey explain? Yeah, you talked about that earlier, right? Yeah. It started from a piece of

764
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:43,800
evidence that I was able to corroborate it with multiple public sources, data sources. At this

765
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,520
point, I've said I've tracked the helicopter. I was able to figure out the exact helicopter that

766
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:57,320
he was on. He flew to this location. Naturally, anyone, if you know a specific aircraft, you can

767
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:06,200
go and look on flight radar and see where it went at a certain time. That was my initial thing that

768
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:14,200
was like, holy crap. Even after that, I have, now at this point, it's just, there's no doubt whatsoever.

769
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:20,280
My issue with Greer, yeah, I completely agree with that. He tried, what I've noticed and possibly

770
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,360
heard is that when he has a witness, he tries to claim the mess as his own so he can be the

771
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,440
central figure and central point of contact for everything. Trollmama, I think there's

772
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:33,320
plenty of people investigating. There's a lot of, there's a lot of really good channels on YouTube,

773
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:38,280
a lot of great people. My butthole is your butthole, Ashton. What the heck?

774
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,960
You didn't hear about that one? No.

775
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:49,560
We don't need to go into it. It was his little logic witness test talking about the

776
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:55,320
effects effect that was on. How does that have to do with investigating? Because he thinks all

777
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,760
explosions have the same pattern. He's like, you have a butthole, I have a butthole, but my

778
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,000
butthole's not your butthole. It was just so cringey. If you want people to take this seriously,

779
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,560
why would technology so overheads? Yeah, I'd like to think back to the, if we were to

780
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:14,200
give a smartphone to the ancient Romans or a nuclear bomb to people in the Victorian era.

781
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:20,920
Interesting question. I believe, I believe, so it looks like a lot of people are kind of commenting

782
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:26,200
or talking about psionics. A lot of people are kind of open to this idea, reading more,

783
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,440
paying attention more. That's something that I need to educate myself more on.

784
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,280
Yeah, there was actually a couple of people that asked this elsewhere, but Michael had

785
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,080
alluded to last year, actually, he was going to be kind of going out and meeting the insider again

786
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:55,400
and seeing like a demonstration of one of these psionics, attracting, calling a craft or something

787
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:00,600
like that. That kind of, that was supposed to happen last year. That fell through. Things are

788
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:06,040
kind of up in the air about that right now. It makes sense. I understand why I can't, I can't

789
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:13,320
really talk about why, but at this point, I honestly don't even think that would be even

790
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,200
something that, because I was kind of nervous about it to begin with, because like what,

791
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,960
you know, even if you could like videotape that or something, is it just going to be three, is it

792
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,640
just going to be three lights in the sky? Yeah. And I was kind of like, I don't know if that's

793
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:31,720
even going to be a good thing to do. And so there's other things that are kind of trying to be put

794
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:38,200
together in the background that I think are going to be a better path forward to help support

795
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,560
disclosure. I'll say that much. Let's keep going. So that might still happen. It's just the, I don't

796
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,960
know when. Thank you, brother. I appreciate the help. Samuel, forget that's a cool profile,

797
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:55,000
I've not read Trinity. I've heard a little bit of a D. Dean Johnson kind of trying to discredit

798
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,920
that case because I know Jacques Malay has worked on it. So I've kind of worked on that case,

799
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,680
but I need to educate myself a little more on that. And I would like to read Trinity and I

800
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:08,360
would like to read what a D&D Johnson says. Gary Nolan worked on a project for CIA,

801
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:15,080
someone we trust. I don't know. Gary Nolan seems to be a, I know nothing like a negative or anything

802
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,400
about Gary Nolan seems like an interesting do kind of pushing for disclosure. I hope his

803
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:26,360
head's in the right place. Yeah, I haven't heard about that either. But okay, bro, say this is

804
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,080
legit. If you listen to his interview, he's very reserved and is free to speak more. Yes,

805
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,640
that's why I want to talk to him because there's so much kind of drama and controversy around him

806
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:38,280
online and kind of social media spaces. But I want to talk to him and hear his story from his words.

807
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:45,720
But he still said 20 back. Yeah, I remember it like, back in like 2016 or so, I heard the first,

808
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:52,760
that first dude, he said the 20 and back thing was a thing to go work at, like they're mining on

809
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:59,240
the moon with reptilians. That requires some extraordinary proof for that. So that is,

810
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:03,080
that is something a bit strange. All right, let's get through these and then we'll start

811
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:08,040
wrapping up eminent domain. I don't think that eminent domain will ever happen. There's also

812
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,680
other people we've talked to, not like whistleblowers or anything, just guys with interesting

813
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,320
backgrounds that also don't think that happened. Private aerospace have legal rights to exploit

814
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:22,040
technology despite potential legal technology transfers. Yeah, I think probably what David

815
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,920
brush says is pretty interesting has a lot through it that a lot of technology is specifically craft

816
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,800
is stored in private domain to avoid any sort of kind of eminent domain grab or any sort of

817
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,040
access to this craft keeps things off books and projects and so forth. You have anything to add?

818
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:42,840
Go ahead. Okay, sorry, I just joined. Was it Joey supposed to be anonymous? Yes,

819
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,240
he was, but this is Joey. Well, it's like, I was never like, supposedly, it's like, if you

820
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,200
do you have a Reddit account? Are you anonymous on Reddit? Yeah, me too. So like, I got into this

821
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,080
whole thing and I was just like, that just kind of maintained. And then it got to a point where

822
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,880
everyone was like, why are you anonymous? And it's like, well, I don't know. And, and, you know,

823
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,800
things were getting, I didn't know how much dangerous put myself in. And I think at this point,

824
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,000
the kind of secret stuff that I knew that I was kind of nervous about having and wanted to remain

825
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,120
anonymous about Michael has has talked about now. So I feel a lot more comfortable kind of at least

826
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:24,120
show my face. And so I decided to do that. So because I feel like the longer I kind of remain

827
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,640
completely in the shadows, like the worst that's going to get in. So it really wasn't a big deal

828
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:32,360
to begin with. And so that's just why. All right, let's get through these.

829
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,840
Hey, what's up, Dutch in case that is a super interesting case. I think I did that in the

830
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,400
first ever iceberg video. Betty and Barney Hills granddaughter is a UFC fighter, Angela Hill. She

831
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,720
talked about that on JRE once. That was pretty interesting. I like that case. That's a really

832
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:52,200
interesting thing. Monster Hunter. Love you. For me, Travis Walton and the passing goal,

833
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,280
sorry, you guys know I can't pronounce anything. Our plenty evidence that NHI abductions are

834
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,440
in a real phenomenon. The thing with me is I kind of sit me to sit down and do like a full

835
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:04,520
investigation for myself to reach any sort of conclusion. Like I like to sit through,

836
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:10,840
read multiple books, kind of way, way things and really sit down and abductions is one thing I

837
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:20,920
really haven't given a ton of time or focus to. What about you? Yeah, I mean, guys, I'm not like

838
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:27,000
I'm not Gerb Gerbs, like researching like all these different cases and stuff. Like I, I'm just

839
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,680
like a normal dude. I was like a regular, like some random Redditor guy and like a rare case,

840
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:37,480
just somehow I got wrapped up into it. And that's kind of what I've been focusing on. And, you know,

841
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:44,040
so I'd love to sometime in the future, like make a website with all my documents as a repository

842
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:49,800
because I have so dang many. And, you know, like in all the, the show and all the times put the

843
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:55,480
documents and stuff I'd lead to, but I'd love like a central database of everything there.

844
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,320
Yeah, Forgotten Language is a super interesting. I first read that in the anonymous briefing

845
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:05,320
document for, for Congress in 2023. The Forgotten Language thing is, is sweet. There's this really

846
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:09,800
cool group of people, some great people that did a deep dive into Forgotten Languages. I need to

847
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,600
kind of get educated from them. Are you going back to the 1933 case I'd like to after those

848
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,160
recent release of RS33 documents? Big on the crypto terrestrial hypothesis, that's super

849
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:24,760
interesting too. I'd like to visit back. Trinity case is weak. You know, I need to study that as well.

850
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:32,200
Let's, I hear you, not Joey yet, not Joey. Sorry, but who was sued a broke brother? If you've seen

851
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:38,360
it in my videos, I'm Gert. This is Joey. Joey's not my name on Reddit. I'm sorry, man. I'm Gert.

852
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:44,360
Okay, let's see. Can't wait for the Obama movie. Yeah, that's weird. The Obama movie about the hill.

853
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah, but he's learning hill. Yeah. Harry. Hey, look at that dog. That's a very cute dog. True nuts

854
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,320
and bolts. I don't know. I got to study anything else. And Harry, thank you so much for, for both

855
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:01,640
of this. I'd like to say as, as kind of like a, but this is a great point. If abductions are

856
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,000
other logical, if we visit another planet, we would sample the floor and on absolutely,

857
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,680
absolutely. That's why it's not something to just throw away, but needs to be kind of investigated.

858
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,800
I would like to say for this live, you know, we didn't really know what to expect. We just kind

859
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,240
of wanted to talk about Michael and so forth. And you guys came with so many awesome questions.

860
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,320
Like this was actually really fun. So, you know, if, if you guys would like to see,

861
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:29,640
to do some more lives or see some like that, I would you want to do some more? Maybe a live

862
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:35,480
or you know, so it's like, all right, I have a ton of respect for what you do. I, I have been so

863
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:41,000
apprehensive about like becoming a content creator because it's like, you, you're very vulnerable

864
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,600
because, you know, if you talk about or investigate a case that you like, and you put some credibility

865
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,840
into it, then like later it turns out to be a complete lie on the line. It's kind of like,

866
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:57,240
that's now attached to you. And I'm like, so afraid to do that. And, and, and like this community can

867
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:02,680
can be very toxic. But like, I got to say, like your, your followers are so great. I think they

868
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:08,360
recognize like the amount of work you put into, you know, the cases that you, you create videos on

869
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,240
and stuff. Also, if I ever like needed hoodwinked or anything like that, and the case turns out to

870
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,040
be false, I'll come out and say it like, if I'm wrong about something, I'll totally do it. I,

871
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:22,360
I would like to cause that helps disclosure, right? Yeah, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's a trick.

872
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:27,080
It's like a tight wire, a tight rope because, you know, and like, how much do you talk about

873
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:33,000
speculation and then, and get into that. And, you know, even if you say like, oh, this is speculation,

874
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,520
people are going to be like, oh wait, he believes this. So I would like to say that, you know,

875
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,280
maybe Joe, you'll join me on some live streams, maybe he won't, but it would be kind of fun to do

876
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:49,400
like a one, one live a week or something like that whenever it works for anybody else. And

877
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:54,520
that will definitely not take place of regular videos because I'll let you guys know a little

878
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:59,720
secret right now before, before we wrap things up. You guys know I mentioned this a lot.

879
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,600
Whoever's been mentioning Magic Eyes Only, the book by Ryan S. Wood,

880
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:11,640
focuses on Crash Retrievals and, and MJ12. Who knows this book? I'm waiting.

881
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,160
Anyways, we'll get to Jengie Squish real fast before I talk about that. Thank you so,

882
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:24,360
dude, your profile picture is valid. Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that. So this,

883
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:29,160
this book, Magic Eyes Only is, I fully recommend this. I'm not sponsored by the author, by the way,

884
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:35,160
about Crash Retrievals and MJ12. The author of this book, Ryan S. Wood, whose father Robert S. Wood,

885
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:40,360
who worked contracting for various defense companies and had a lot to say about MJ12, UAP and so

886
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:47,000
forth. I have contacted Ryan S. Wood. I know him. I've talked to him multiple times on the phone.

887
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,280
He lives near me. I will be doing an in-person project with him, kind of doing a full dive on

888
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:58,840
the MJ12 soon too. And I cannot wait for that, man. That, that's going to be an awesome case

889
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:04,200
because the MJ12 is so complex. Like I can't have like a pea grain like myself understand

890
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,680
everything right away. So something with Ryan S. Wood is going to be, be really great.

891
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,320
Yeah. So that's really cool. We'll do more lives if you guys want. And should I keep,

892
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,800
you got an invite to author on the show? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. So, so you remember the

893
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:24,840
interview I had with, with, with Joey about Michael, I plan to do a documentary interview with him,

894
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:29,080
where he and I have a full conversation, but splice throughout the conversation is different

895
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:33,320
studies and anecdotes and relevant documents and kind of relevant pathways to go down,

896
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:39,240
not just he and I sitting for, oh man, nobody's selling nothing here, bro. Nobody's selling

897
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:45,720
nothing. But for, for that, for that video with Ryan S. Wood, kind of sit down with him,

898
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:50,680
do an in-person video recording and kind of make that into a documentary.

899
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,400
But yeah, I'll do another one of these soon guys. And if you want, should I, do you keep

900
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:00,280
live streams up? Yeah. All right. Yeah, people will watch them, right? Thank you guys so much

901
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:06,040
for joining. I really appreciate every single one of your views. Like we got like 140 viewers,

902
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:10,680
which is, which is crazy, man. I love Zambia too. I've never been, but I've only been to Morocco,

903
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:18,920
so. He's done a lot of traveling. I'd like to do some more, man. The lady was, you got,

904
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:25,160
which is not going to read it, but thank you guys so much for tuning in. I really appreciate it.

905
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,840
I really appreciate all the good questions. Yeah, this was, this was awesome. And I appreciate

906
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,720
you hosting me here and, and, you know, having these, these few days together. It's been awesome.

907
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:37,960
So we'll let the Herrera video out this as soon as possible to interview. And I'm super excited

908
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,840
to see what you guys think, because I'd like to open up some more discussion about that.

909
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,520
All right. Peace. All right. Thanks, gang.
