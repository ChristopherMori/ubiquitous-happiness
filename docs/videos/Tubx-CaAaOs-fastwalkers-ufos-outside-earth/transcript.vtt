00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
What if I told you the terms we use every single day, UFO and UAP are limited and only

00:07.080 --> 00:10.280
paint part of the picture according to the US government?

00:10.280 --> 00:15.880
Would you be surprised to learn that UFO-UAP encompass only phenomena and transmedial craft

00:15.880 --> 00:19.880
operating within Earth's atmosphere and under the planet's oceans?

00:19.880 --> 00:27.160
In fact, the USG, particularly NORAD and the US Space Force, have an entirely different

00:27.160 --> 00:34.480
designation for UFOs entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere, fast walkers and slow walkers.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.880
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb, I'm back and as always thank you for returning to the channel.

00:39.880 --> 00:46.560
Today we are going to go down the deep rabbit hole of space-bound UFOs known as fast walkers.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.720
Too little the question is asked, how often are UFOs observed in outer space?

00:51.720 --> 00:58.240
Well, the USG is clearly concerned about this question and has a storied history of investigating

00:58.240 --> 01:00.240
fast walkers.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.360
So let's get some terms out of the way and again, remember there is a distinction here

01:04.360 --> 01:05.840
from UFO.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.680
The Walker call sign describes objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere at variable

01:10.680 --> 01:12.040
speeds.

01:12.040 --> 01:18.320
Slow walker for low velocity objects and fast walkers, well, you guys can probably guess.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.320
Today we are only going to focus on the latter, the fast walker.

01:22.320 --> 01:29.240
This distinction is crucial as during an age of increasing, albeit surface level UFO transparency,

01:29.240 --> 01:35.000
it allows the USG to avoid declassification slash Freedom of Information Act requests

01:35.000 --> 01:37.840
for fast walkers and slow walkers.

01:37.840 --> 01:43.960
In late 2023, John Greenwald of the Black Vault received a decisive and final response

01:43.960 --> 01:49.640
to his countless FOIA requests on the term fast walkers and slow walkers.

01:49.640 --> 01:55.000
This response came from the US Space Force, the famed USAF space division.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.040
With this request, Greenwald sought any reports, information, detailed military info on this

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
topic.

02:02.040 --> 02:09.360
In response, Space Force issued a full denial to divulge any material under FOIA, citing

02:09.360 --> 02:15.480
exception one, as a denial to disclose which states quote, under criteria established by

02:15.480 --> 02:21.000
an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.160
But curiously, this wasn't actually the first time Greenwald was denied access to any information

02:26.160 --> 02:27.840
on fast walker.

02:27.840 --> 02:35.280
Ten years earlier in 2013, Greenwald submitted a similar request which was handled by USNorthcom,

02:35.280 --> 02:40.520
the United States Northern Command which oversees NORAD, the North American Aerospace

02:40.520 --> 02:42.600
Defense Command.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.960
NORAD is headquartered at Space Force Base in Colorado.

02:45.960 --> 02:50.360
I know this doesn't seem very important now, but keep NORAD in mind.

02:50.360 --> 02:56.840
Anyways, Northcom and NORAD responded to Greenwald stating fast walker documentation is quote,

02:56.840 --> 03:04.720
currently and properly classified, again by executive order 13526, quote, considered

03:04.720 --> 03:10.920
critical to national defense or foreign policy and is thus controlled by the US government.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.520
But there were two documents that were provided to Greenwald.

03:14.520 --> 03:20.560
One, a paper titled Orbit Determination of Sunlit Illuminated Objects Detected by Overhead

03:20.560 --> 03:28.640
Platforms from 1989 and Space-Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging

03:28.640 --> 03:31.640
Passive Sensors from 2008.

03:31.640 --> 03:37.960
But NORAD's refusal to share any data on fast walkers or UFO tracking data doesn't start

03:37.960 --> 03:39.280
with Greenwald.

03:39.280 --> 03:44.840
Check this out, this is an extremely interesting excerpt from the book, Clear Intent, the government

03:44.840 --> 03:49.880
cover-up of the UFO experience by authors Barry J. Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett.

03:49.880 --> 03:56.660
This book contains both a section of the scanned NORAD UAP reporting sheet, but also a chapters

03:56.660 --> 04:01.000
on UFOs and FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.560
Within this chapter is a request to NORAD for UAP tracking data to which NORAD replies

04:06.560 --> 04:16.360
will require over 18,000 man hours and a cost of $155,000 at the time in 1979, which would

04:16.360 --> 04:20.400
equate to well over half a million USD today.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.640
NORAD also refused to waive the fees on a follow-up request three years later.

04:25.640 --> 04:31.680
So let's use the documents provided to Greenwald to get a jump start on fast walkers and utilize

04:31.680 --> 04:34.880
any other clues to try and learn more about them.

04:34.880 --> 04:40.800
We can trace this fast walker designation to originate with NORAD, utilized to detect

04:40.800 --> 04:46.160
objects entering or leaving atmosphere, as I mentioned above, at significant speeds by

04:46.160 --> 04:48.000
US defense systems.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.280
The first of the two documents, the one on orbit determination of sunlit illuminated

04:52.280 --> 04:57.560
objects, was written by USAF Captain Richard P. Ossedax.

04:57.560 --> 05:03.120
And this details the joint efforts of NORAD and the Air Force Foreign Technology Division

05:03.120 --> 05:09.280
to investigate uncataloged space-bound objects detected by reflected sunlight passing through

05:09.280 --> 05:13.960
satellite sensors designated as fast walkers.

05:13.960 --> 05:20.800
This document states that the data on these objects has been recorded since 1972 by, quote,

05:20.800 --> 05:29.040
certain ballistic missile early warning satellite systems located at various geostationary locations.

05:29.040 --> 05:35.680
And also, this paper sought to determine orbit or motion of these objects, but was deemed

05:35.680 --> 05:41.040
unsolvable by former efforts by one researcher, Wong, as mentioned.

05:41.040 --> 05:46.520
Shockingly, the report states the fast walker analysis has become an increasingly important

05:46.520 --> 05:51.760
issue due to the increase in geosynchronous satellites, which detect the objects while

05:51.760 --> 05:53.960
ground-based sensors cannot.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.880
So very important here.

05:55.880 --> 06:00.440
We can assume the increase in detection and database built in 1972 is a result of the

06:00.440 --> 06:03.040
Defense Support Program.

06:03.040 --> 06:08.880
The DSP served and serves currently as the US's primary ballistic missile entry warning

06:08.880 --> 06:14.720
system and its first satellite DSP-1 went into orbit in 1970.

06:14.720 --> 06:21.480
Additionally, DSP information is relayed to NORAD, and remember, DSP is now part of the

06:21.480 --> 06:23.120
US Space Force.

06:23.120 --> 06:29.280
Our second paper on space-based satellite tracking was written by Captain Bradley R. Townsend

06:29.280 --> 06:34.640
in the Air Force Institute of Technology out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and sought

06:34.640 --> 06:41.520
to revisit to determine the orbit or movement of fast walkers again, quote, satellite-based

06:41.520 --> 06:45.800
sensors looking down at the Earth's surface occasionally observe reflected light from

06:45.800 --> 06:50.440
an object passing through the image, which is moving too fast relative to the background

06:50.440 --> 06:53.480
of the image to be located within the atmosphere.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.960
These objects are commonly called fast walkers.

06:56.960 --> 07:03.680
These study comments on the 1972 Ausadax study and referred to the database origin from

07:03.680 --> 07:07.600
obtained ballistic missile entry warning satellites.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.480
Not much else to cover here, as study methods yield similar results with an inability to

07:12.480 --> 07:18.080
determine range to fast walker targets, but remember again that the ballistic missile

07:18.080 --> 07:23.160
warning satellites are mentioned here again, DSP, the Defense Support Program.

07:23.160 --> 07:28.480
Our trail with fast walkers NORAD and DSP Ballistic Warning Detection satellites doesn't

07:28.480 --> 07:31.040
stop with these two documents, however.

07:31.040 --> 07:37.800
For example, on the 6th of January 1967, Scientific Advisor to Project Blue Book Jay Allen Heineck

07:37.800 --> 07:44.080
I talked about him extensively in many videos, like my history on the UFO Stigma, discussed

07:44.080 --> 07:52.000
at Goddard Space Flight Center that NORAD tracks UFOs and has been since 1957, and that

07:52.000 --> 07:58.040
every single continental U.S. military UFO case in Blue Book files are designated as

07:58.040 --> 08:00.000
a NORAD case.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.120
And does anyone remember the Hillary Clinton campaign leaks provided by WikiLeaks?

08:05.120 --> 08:07.680
This is where a rabbit hole gets wild.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.880
Well, pouring through them you can find an incredibly interesting email chain to Clinton

08:12.880 --> 08:15.600
campaign manager John Podesta.

08:15.600 --> 08:21.680
On this email from March of 2015, there is a detailed communication between USG contractor

08:21.880 --> 08:24.320
Bob Fish and Podesta.

08:24.320 --> 08:29.240
Fish was the program manager for several highly classified U.S. government advanced communication

08:29.240 --> 08:33.200
systems projects in the 1980s and 1990s.

08:33.200 --> 08:37.280
These included the White House and several executive branch intelligence agencies.

08:37.280 --> 08:42.320
And for what it's worth, just as a side note, Bob himself was vetted by Ross Colthart.

08:42.320 --> 08:48.720
But anyways, Fish makes an immediate and direct claim that quote, one of the government programs

08:48.720 --> 08:56.280
that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.960
In fact, the main body of this email is so interesting I may as well quote the whole

09:00.960 --> 09:01.960
thing.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.760
Quote, I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web.

09:06.760 --> 09:12.320
While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them

09:12.320 --> 09:16.720
as the U.S. prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

09:16.720 --> 09:21.360
On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization

09:21.360 --> 09:23.360
in El Segundo, California.

09:23.360 --> 09:27.680
No one could get into the cafeteria without TS-SCI clearance.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.780
So this was not a lightweight group of gossipers.

09:31.780 --> 09:36.160
One of these times, a member of that group was really excited, said they just picked

09:36.160 --> 09:39.600
up a fast walker, I assume that same day.

09:39.600 --> 09:44.720
He described how it entered our atmosphere from deep space, origin actually unknown,

09:44.720 --> 09:49.680
but of course from the backside of the satellite and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely

09:49.680 --> 09:51.840
on its way to Earth.

09:51.840 --> 09:56.600
Not only was it going very fast, but it made a 30 degree course correction turn, which

09:56.600 --> 10:01.440
means it did not have a ballistic freefall reentry trajectory that a meteorite might

10:01.440 --> 10:02.440
have.

10:02.440 --> 10:07.720
So it was under some sort of control, although whether it was manned or just robotic, there's

10:07.720 --> 10:09.760
no way to tell.

10:09.760 --> 10:15.600
Towards the end of the email, Bob references a line in the 2014 Defense Support Program

10:15.600 --> 10:21.920
fact sheet to support the idea the DSP is still collecting fast walker data 24 years

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
later.

10:22.920 --> 10:29.280
Quote, In addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions

10:29.280 --> 10:34.680
of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

10:34.680 --> 10:40.840
Remember this line, and remember the mention by DSP itself of the Aerospace Corporation.

10:40.840 --> 10:47.120
Fish also links to a strange, now defunct blog, which I've accessed via the web archives

10:47.120 --> 10:53.120
titled quote, Top Secret Spy Satellite Spot UFOs by Tim Schwartz.

10:53.120 --> 10:58.240
Fish strangely comments that much of the information on this site is correct.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.360
But where else can we connect DSP and fast walkers?

11:02.360 --> 11:06.600
Let's visit a case from the 5th of May 1984.

11:06.600 --> 11:12.080
An anonymous source claims to a journalist named Joe Stafula, a former Army Criminal

11:12.080 --> 11:18.440
Investigation Command, that a highly classified U.S. Defense Support Program spy satellite

11:18.440 --> 11:20.520
detected a UAP.

11:20.520 --> 11:26.560
It comes within 1.8 miles of the DSP satellite before flying below it over the Indian Ocean.

11:26.560 --> 11:33.280
It is moving 22,000 miles per hour, changes course, and allegedly flies back into outer

11:33.280 --> 11:34.800
space.

11:34.800 --> 11:40.320
Since this case is so old and there is so little published about it, tracking this down

11:40.320 --> 11:42.720
has been an absolute bear.

11:42.720 --> 11:47.120
But I have been able to find two now destroyed sites on this article.

11:47.120 --> 11:52.340
And by the way, does this case not sound very similar to the incident Fish was describing

11:52.340 --> 11:53.840
to Podesta?

11:54.120 --> 12:00.560
Anyways, both sites state, quote, this object was first spotted by the ultra sensitive orbiting

12:00.560 --> 12:06.240
U.S. DSP satellite our country uses for detailed surveillance and air defense.

12:06.240 --> 12:11.240
These satellites have the infrared capacity to spot small heat sources on the surface

12:11.240 --> 12:16.880
of the Earth and are time proven as effective monitoring devices, end quote.

12:16.880 --> 12:23.160
Which this lines up with the 1970 Duke paper, where the DSP satellites monitor small light

12:23.160 --> 12:26.200
or heat reflections off of fast walkers.

12:26.200 --> 12:32.360
This ancient blog, Deb's UFO research, provides an interesting depiction of the event through

12:32.360 --> 12:34.560
three images.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.160
Image one shows the DSP one satellite.

12:38.160 --> 12:42.380
Image two shows the fast walker headed left to right towards Earth.

12:42.380 --> 12:47.960
And image three depicts the reversal of the fast walker as it retreats back to open space.

12:47.960 --> 12:52.880
This site also provides an image of the trajectory of the fast walker by Stifula himself and

12:52.880 --> 12:59.240
states, quote, an object was spotted by a U.S. DSP satellite and tracked as it sped first

12:59.240 --> 13:06.240
directly toward the Earth and passed in front and within 15 miles of the U.S. DSP satellite.

13:06.240 --> 13:11.080
It suddenly and without impact or contact with other devices or obstructions curved outward

13:11.080 --> 13:12.880
away from the Earth.

13:12.880 --> 13:17.040
It was tracked for another nine minutes until it disappeared, end quote.

13:17.040 --> 13:24.320
Additionally, the site publishes a recreation or possibly an image of the top secret incident

13:24.320 --> 13:26.000
report summary.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.720
See the incident underlined.

13:27.720 --> 13:34.480
I am still unclear on terminology here such as the UCF listing and the ST in the field

13:34.480 --> 13:35.480
of view.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.800
If you can identify these terms to help decipher this image, please let me know and maybe we

13:39.800 --> 13:42.520
can work together on a follow up to this case.

13:42.520 --> 13:47.040
Stifula states, quote, have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that date

13:47.040 --> 13:51.440
shows an event at the same time with the same characteristics, end quote.

13:51.440 --> 13:57.240
We cannot use this evidence to prove or deny this case's story and records as true or

13:57.240 --> 14:03.640
false concretely until we can do a full analysis on an entire DSP report.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.160
This case remains speculative.

14:06.160 --> 14:12.000
Our next case with ties to the DSP and fast walkers will actually be familiar to fans

14:12.000 --> 14:18.960
of my channel yet will likely shock you, the 1976 Tehran UFO encounter.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.380
For those of you who have not seen my first grounded flight due to UFOs video, I recommend

14:23.380 --> 14:24.760
checking that out.

14:24.760 --> 14:53.520
So here's a clip on one of my all time favorite UFO encounters.

14:53.520 --> 15:02.640
The link to fast walker was done by researchers Lee Graham and Roger Rager, satellite sensor

15:02.640 --> 15:06.160
technicians at Aerojet in California.

15:06.160 --> 15:11.960
They themselves confirmed that the UFO sighting over Tehran was in fact tracked by the United

15:11.960 --> 15:15.520
States military DSP satellite.

15:15.520 --> 15:21.320
During their investigations, Graham and Rager located a computer printout from the timeframe

15:21.320 --> 15:27.040
of the Iranian UFO overflight, which shows that the DSP satellite definitely detected

15:27.040 --> 15:31.840
a quote anomalous object in Iranian airspace.

15:31.840 --> 15:37.000
After a long and fruitless venture to confirm these claims finding nothing besides a declassified

15:37.000 --> 15:43.080
paper often referenced by Rager titled, Now You See It, Now You Don't, by Yousaf Captain

15:43.080 --> 15:49.480
Harry S. Shields, I was finally able to begin to pull on the strings of the evidence Graham

15:49.480 --> 15:51.640
and Rager proposed.

15:51.640 --> 15:57.840
Within the NYCAP report of the 1976 Tehran incident, there exists a link to a long dead

15:57.840 --> 16:06.320
email chain between Brad Sparks, an early founder of CAUS, the Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,

16:06.320 --> 16:09.120
and blog owner RJ Kohen.

16:09.120 --> 16:16.320
Here Brad raises concerns about DSP-1 detecting the UFO in the 76 case and questioned whether

16:16.320 --> 16:23.680
the satellite actually captured the Mirage F-4s scrambled to pursue the UFOs instead.

16:23.680 --> 16:29.920
Spark references a quote, out of focus graphic image, end quote, that only gives the date

16:29.920 --> 16:37.200
not time of the event and states quote, 238 scans possible SR.

16:37.200 --> 16:43.600
Since DSP scans once every 10 seconds, this means that DSP scanned an object for 39.7

16:43.600 --> 16:50.000
minutes and the SR term listed may refer to strategic reconnaissance.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.280
After going deeper, I was able to find an email chain from the now also defunct VirtuallyStrange.net

16:57.280 --> 17:04.760
dating back to 1998, which references the DSP connection in the 1976 Tehran case.

17:04.760 --> 17:10.840
This email states quote, JPEG is available at the above URL, end quote, so at this point

17:10.840 --> 17:14.720
I was finally getting close to finding the actual image.

17:14.720 --> 17:21.240
Following the source of the JPEG takes us to a 1997 blog post on ufoworld.simplenet.com,

17:21.240 --> 17:24.480
titled quote, the DSP connection.

17:24.480 --> 17:30.400
And here we get the out of focus grainy image that supposedly depicts the DSP printouts

17:30.400 --> 17:34.840
highlighting the 1976 Tehran fast walker by Graham Enreger.

17:34.840 --> 17:40.800
Guys, the only things we can determine from this raw image is a similar to structure to

17:40.800 --> 17:47.200
the 1984 fast walker case where the term UCF is referenced multiple times as well and the

17:47.200 --> 17:51.160
aforementioned 238 scans possible SR.

17:51.160 --> 17:55.080
The rest of the image is illegible and frustrating.

17:55.080 --> 18:01.360
Due to my limited graphic experience, I have tried and failed to AI upscale this image to

18:01.360 --> 18:04.200
make the rest of the text legible.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.800
Also my backwards image search yielded zero results.

18:08.800 --> 18:14.280
If you think you can help me make this document legible, please please please email me at

18:14.280 --> 18:19.280
uapgirb.com and let's figure this case out together.

18:19.280 --> 18:25.880
So there we have it, two cases connecting fast walkers and DSP, but both lead us to somewhat

18:25.880 --> 18:29.840
dead ends with insufficient data to further our investigation.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.760
I am going to keep getting to the bottom of this hopefully with one of you, but let's

18:33.760 --> 18:37.160
get some relevant updates to these cases soon.

18:37.160 --> 18:44.160
So remember back how Fish mentioned, at the end of the 2014 DSP fact sheet, quote, in

18:44.160 --> 18:50.040
addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard

18:50.040 --> 18:54.160
support system that will aid public safety in the future.

18:54.160 --> 19:01.040
Well guys, the Aerospace Corporation is suspected as one of the legacy private corporations who

19:01.040 --> 19:04.960
engage in, quote, real UAP research.

19:04.960 --> 19:10.100
In ufologist Jacques Fillet's book Hidden Science 5, which accounts for Valet's journals

19:10.100 --> 19:17.720
from 2000s to 2009, he along with Kit Green, physicist Hal Puthoff, astrophysicist Eric

19:17.720 --> 19:25.440
Davis and Kristen B. Zimmerman, suspect that Aerospace Corporation alongside Lockheed Raytheon

19:25.440 --> 19:31.880
and Northrop Grumman are among the USG contractors involved with deep UFO work.

19:31.880 --> 19:37.200
And in Ross Colthart's fantastic book In Plain Sight, I would highly recommend reading

19:37.200 --> 19:38.280
that book.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.760
He writes that a source told him about an aerospace company in Long Beach, California

19:42.760 --> 19:46.160
with access to, quote, the wreckage.

19:46.160 --> 19:50.800
The source told Ross, quote, the program was controlled by a relatively small group of

19:50.800 --> 19:56.240
people, not all in government, including people in aerospace, intelligence, and corporate

19:56.240 --> 19:58.680
financial communities.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.520
The source said that the company had sprawling gardens.

20:02.520 --> 20:07.720
And the only major aerospace company in Long Beach, California that has this type of campus

20:07.720 --> 20:10.000
is the Aerospace Corporation.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.120
And remember Colthart is no slouch, he is the man after all who broke the grush story.

20:15.120 --> 20:20.400
And there is much more work to be done investigating the Aerospace Corporation that is not the

20:20.400 --> 20:22.080
subject of this video.

20:22.080 --> 20:29.520
But it is interesting to see how Space Force and DSP would be analyzing DSP data with the

20:29.520 --> 20:36.720
Aerospace Corporation, a company with possible larger ties to covert UAP study to, quote,

20:36.720 --> 20:42.880
develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.520
Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today.

20:45.680 --> 20:51.040
I know it just feels like we started to scratch the surface of fast walkers and space bound UAP,

20:51.040 --> 20:57.600
but I wanted to make this video for a brief look into kind of how Space Force, USG,

20:58.320 --> 21:05.600
DOD, NORAD kind of use the terminology of fast walker to skirt around FOIA and how this isn't

21:05.600 --> 21:06.320
a new term.

21:06.320 --> 21:13.440
And we can trace back to the 76 Iran case, the 1984 DSP-1 case to, you know, possibly

21:13.760 --> 21:16.560
lead some evidence to early fast walker detection.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.040
Those two cases are of extreme interest to me.

21:19.040 --> 21:24.400
And if you think you can help me out decipher that terminology, find out where those images

21:24.400 --> 21:28.800
were actually sourced from or AI upscale them to help me figure out what the heck they are

21:28.800 --> 21:29.200
saying.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.960
Please again, contact me at uapgurb at gmail.com.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.480
And I hope you found that Lee M. Graham pretty interesting.

21:36.480 --> 21:40.720
I've actually tried to connect with him on Facebook and so that is pending.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.600
I'd like to hear more about his research into this case.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.320
And there's actually a lot of interesting things surrounding Graham and some claims

21:48.320 --> 21:48.800
he made.

21:48.800 --> 21:56.160
I've heard some people liken him to a similar person to a 1980s UFO whistleblower.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.080
So should be some exciting stuff on that if I can actually get in contact with him.

22:00.960 --> 22:06.000
Guys, please remember if you enjoy the video to like or subscribe and leave a comment what you

22:06.000 --> 22:10.800
think about DSP, fast walkers, space bound UAP and so forth.

22:11.360 --> 22:16.160
Thank you guys so much for joining and as always, I will catch you for the next video.
