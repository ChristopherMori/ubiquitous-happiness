description: "Today let's take a look at the term known as Fastwalkers, a designation\
  \ for UFOs detected entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere. The terms Fastwalker\
  \ and Slowwalker have conveniently been utilized by USNORTHCOM and NORAD to avoid\
  \ any sort of declassification through FOIA requests or other means by Executive\
  \ Order.\n\nIn this video, we will cover 3 instances in which NORAD, Space Force,\
  \ and the USG denied access to data on fastwalkers and UFOs in space. The Trail\
  \ does not end here, however. NORAD's interest in UAP was outed by the infamous\
  \ J. Allen Hynek in the 60s. Fastwalkers also appear within the 2016 Hillary Clinton\
  \ email leaks where communications between campaign manager John Podesta and USG\
  \ Contractor Bob Fish. Fish discusses the Defense Support Program's (DSP) role in\
  \ monitoring UFO/UAP/Fastwalker. \n\nFollowing down this rabbit hole we can stumble\
  \ onto 2 shocking cases allegedly involving UAP detection from DSP - one UFO performing\
  \ impossible maneuvers in space, and another offering confirmation to the 1976 Tehran\
  \ UFO incident. \n\nThe Rabbit Hole of DSP and Fastwalkers goes deeper with ties\
  \ to the Aerospace Corporation, one of the companies suggested by Jacques Vallee\
  \ and Ross Coulthart participating in \"real\" UFO research. \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:59\
