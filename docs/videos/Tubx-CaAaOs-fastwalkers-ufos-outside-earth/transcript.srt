1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
What if I told you the terms we use every single day, UFO and UAP are limited and only

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,280
paint part of the picture according to the US government?

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,880
Would you be surprised to learn that UFO-UAP encompass only phenomena and transmedial craft

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,880
operating within Earth's atmosphere and under the planet's oceans?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,160
In fact, the USG, particularly NORAD and the US Space Force, have an entirely different

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,480
designation for UFOs entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere, fast walkers and slow walkers.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,880
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb, I'm back and as always thank you for returning to the channel.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,560
Today we are going to go down the deep rabbit hole of space-bound UFOs known as fast walkers.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,720
Too little the question is asked, how often are UFOs observed in outer space?

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, the USG is clearly concerned about this question and has a storied history of investigating

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,240
fast walkers.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,360
So let's get some terms out of the way and again, remember there is a distinction here

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,840
from UFO.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,680
The Walker call sign describes objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere at variable

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,040
speeds.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,320
Slow walker for low velocity objects and fast walkers, well, you guys can probably guess.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Today we are only going to focus on the latter, the fast walker.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,240
This distinction is crucial as during an age of increasing, albeit surface level UFO transparency,

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,000
it allows the USG to avoid declassification slash Freedom of Information Act requests

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,840
for fast walkers and slow walkers.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,960
In late 2023, John Greenwald of the Black Vault received a decisive and final response

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,640
to his countless FOIA requests on the term fast walkers and slow walkers.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,000
This response came from the US Space Force, the famed USAF space division.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,040
With this request, Greenwald sought any reports, information, detailed military info on this

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
topic.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,360
In response, Space Force issued a full denial to divulge any material under FOIA, citing

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,480
exception one, as a denial to disclose which states quote, under criteria established by

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,000
an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,160
But curiously, this wasn't actually the first time Greenwald was denied access to any information

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
on fast walker.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,280
Ten years earlier in 2013, Greenwald submitted a similar request which was handled by USNorthcom,

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,520
the United States Northern Command which oversees NORAD, the North American Aerospace

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,600
Defense Command.

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,960
NORAD is headquartered at Space Force Base in Colorado.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,360
I know this doesn't seem very important now, but keep NORAD in mind.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,840
Anyways, Northcom and NORAD responded to Greenwald stating fast walker documentation is quote,

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,720
currently and properly classified, again by executive order 13526, quote, considered

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,920
critical to national defense or foreign policy and is thus controlled by the US government.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,520
But there were two documents that were provided to Greenwald.

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,560
One, a paper titled Orbit Determination of Sunlit Illuminated Objects Detected by Overhead

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,640
Platforms from 1989 and Space-Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Passive Sensors from 2008.

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,960
But NORAD's refusal to share any data on fast walkers or UFO tracking data doesn't start

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
with Greenwald.

45
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Check this out, this is an extremely interesting excerpt from the book, Clear Intent, the government

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,880
cover-up of the UFO experience by authors Barry J. Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett.

47
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,660
This book contains both a section of the scanned NORAD UAP reporting sheet, but also a chapters

48
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,000
on UFOs and FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,560
Within this chapter is a request to NORAD for UAP tracking data to which NORAD replies

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:16,360
will require over 18,000 man hours and a cost of $155,000 at the time in 1979, which would

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,400
equate to well over half a million USD today.

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,640
NORAD also refused to waive the fees on a follow-up request three years later.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,680
So let's use the documents provided to Greenwald to get a jump start on fast walkers and utilize

54
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
any other clues to try and learn more about them.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,800
We can trace this fast walker designation to originate with NORAD, utilized to detect

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,160
objects entering or leaving atmosphere, as I mentioned above, at significant speeds by

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
US defense systems.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,280
The first of the two documents, the one on orbit determination of sunlit illuminated

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,560
objects, was written by USAF Captain Richard P. Ossedax.

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,120
And this details the joint efforts of NORAD and the Air Force Foreign Technology Division

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,280
to investigate uncataloged space-bound objects detected by reflected sunlight passing through

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,960
satellite sensors designated as fast walkers.

63
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,800
This document states that the data on these objects has been recorded since 1972 by, quote,

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,040
certain ballistic missile early warning satellite systems located at various geostationary locations.

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,680
And also, this paper sought to determine orbit or motion of these objects, but was deemed

66
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,040
unsolvable by former efforts by one researcher, Wong, as mentioned.

67
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,520
Shockingly, the report states the fast walker analysis has become an increasingly important

68
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,760
issue due to the increase in geosynchronous satellites, which detect the objects while

69
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,960
ground-based sensors cannot.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,880
So very important here.

71
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,440
We can assume the increase in detection and database built in 1972 is a result of the

72
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,040
Defense Support Program.

73
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,880
The DSP served and serves currently as the US's primary ballistic missile entry warning

74
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,720
system and its first satellite DSP-1 went into orbit in 1970.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,480
Additionally, DSP information is relayed to NORAD, and remember, DSP is now part of the

76
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
US Space Force.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,280
Our second paper on space-based satellite tracking was written by Captain Bradley R. Townsend

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,640
in the Air Force Institute of Technology out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and sought

79
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,520
to revisit to determine the orbit or movement of fast walkers again, quote, satellite-based

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,800
sensors looking down at the Earth's surface occasionally observe reflected light from

81
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,440
an object passing through the image, which is moving too fast relative to the background

82
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,480
of the image to be located within the atmosphere.

83
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,960
These objects are commonly called fast walkers.

84
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,680
These study comments on the 1972 Ausadax study and referred to the database origin from

85
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,600
obtained ballistic missile entry warning satellites.

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,480
Not much else to cover here, as study methods yield similar results with an inability to

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,080
determine range to fast walker targets, but remember again that the ballistic missile

88
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,160
warning satellites are mentioned here again, DSP, the Defense Support Program.

89
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,480
Our trail with fast walkers NORAD and DSP Ballistic Warning Detection satellites doesn't

90
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,040
stop with these two documents, however.

91
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,800
For example, on the 6th of January 1967, Scientific Advisor to Project Blue Book Jay Allen Heineck

92
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,080
I talked about him extensively in many videos, like my history on the UFO Stigma, discussed

93
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:52,000
at Goddard Space Flight Center that NORAD tracks UFOs and has been since 1957, and that

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,040
every single continental U.S. military UFO case in Blue Book files are designated as

95
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,000
a NORAD case.

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,120
And does anyone remember the Hillary Clinton campaign leaks provided by WikiLeaks?

97
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
This is where a rabbit hole gets wild.

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Well, pouring through them you can find an incredibly interesting email chain to Clinton

99
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,600
campaign manager John Podesta.

100
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,680
On this email from March of 2015, there is a detailed communication between USG contractor

101
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,320
Bob Fish and Podesta.

102
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,240
Fish was the program manager for several highly classified U.S. government advanced communication

103
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,200
systems projects in the 1980s and 1990s.

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,280
These included the White House and several executive branch intelligence agencies.

105
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,320
And for what it's worth, just as a side note, Bob himself was vetted by Ross Colthart.

106
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,720
But anyways, Fish makes an immediate and direct claim that quote, one of the government programs

107
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,280
that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program.

108
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,960
In fact, the main body of this email is so interesting I may as well quote the whole

109
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
thing.

110
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,760
Quote, I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web.

111
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,320
While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them

112
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
as the U.S. prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
in El Segundo, California.

115
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
No one could get into the cafeteria without TS-SCI clearance.

116
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,780
So this was not a lightweight group of gossipers.

117
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,160
One of these times, a member of that group was really excited, said they just picked

118
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,600
up a fast walker, I assume that same day.

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,720
He described how it entered our atmosphere from deep space, origin actually unknown,

120
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,680
but of course from the backside of the satellite and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely

121
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,840
on its way to Earth.

122
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Not only was it going very fast, but it made a 30 degree course correction turn, which

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,440
means it did not have a ballistic freefall reentry trajectory that a meteorite might

124
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
have.

125
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,720
So it was under some sort of control, although whether it was manned or just robotic, there's

126
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,760
no way to tell.

127
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Towards the end of the email, Bob references a line in the 2014 Defense Support Program

128
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,920
fact sheet to support the idea the DSP is still collecting fast walker data 24 years

129
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
later.

130
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,280
Quote, In addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions

131
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,680
of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,840
Remember this line, and remember the mention by DSP itself of the Aerospace Corporation.

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,120
Fish also links to a strange, now defunct blog, which I've accessed via the web archives

134
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,120
titled quote, Top Secret Spy Satellite Spot UFOs by Tim Schwartz.

135
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Fish strangely comments that much of the information on this site is correct.

136
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,360
But where else can we connect DSP and fast walkers?

137
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,600
Let's visit a case from the 5th of May 1984.

138
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,080
An anonymous source claims to a journalist named Joe Stafula, a former Army Criminal

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,440
Investigation Command, that a highly classified U.S. Defense Support Program spy satellite

140
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,520
detected a UAP.

141
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,560
It comes within 1.8 miles of the DSP satellite before flying below it over the Indian Ocean.

142
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,280
It is moving 22,000 miles per hour, changes course, and allegedly flies back into outer

143
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,800
space.

144
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,320
Since this case is so old and there is so little published about it, tracking this down

145
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
has been an absolute bear.

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
But I have been able to find two now destroyed sites on this article.

147
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,340
And by the way, does this case not sound very similar to the incident Fish was describing

148
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,840
to Podesta?

149
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,560
Anyways, both sites state, quote, this object was first spotted by the ultra sensitive orbiting

150
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,240
U.S. DSP satellite our country uses for detailed surveillance and air defense.

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,240
These satellites have the infrared capacity to spot small heat sources on the surface

152
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,880
of the Earth and are time proven as effective monitoring devices, end quote.

153
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,160
Which this lines up with the 1970 Duke paper, where the DSP satellites monitor small light

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,200
or heat reflections off of fast walkers.

155
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,360
This ancient blog, Deb's UFO research, provides an interesting depiction of the event through

156
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,560
three images.

157
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,160
Image one shows the DSP one satellite.

158
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,380
Image two shows the fast walker headed left to right towards Earth.

159
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,960
And image three depicts the reversal of the fast walker as it retreats back to open space.

160
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,880
This site also provides an image of the trajectory of the fast walker by Stifula himself and

161
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,240
states, quote, an object was spotted by a U.S. DSP satellite and tracked as it sped first

162
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,240
directly toward the Earth and passed in front and within 15 miles of the U.S. DSP satellite.

163
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,080
It suddenly and without impact or contact with other devices or obstructions curved outward

164
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,880
away from the Earth.

165
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,040
It was tracked for another nine minutes until it disappeared, end quote.

166
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,320
Additionally, the site publishes a recreation or possibly an image of the top secret incident

167
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
report summary.

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
See the incident underlined.

169
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,480
I am still unclear on terminology here such as the UCF listing and the ST in the field

170
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
of view.

171
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,800
If you can identify these terms to help decipher this image, please let me know and maybe we

172
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,520
can work together on a follow up to this case.

173
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,040
Stifula states, quote, have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that date

174
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,440
shows an event at the same time with the same characteristics, end quote.

175
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,240
We cannot use this evidence to prove or deny this case's story and records as true or

176
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,640
false concretely until we can do a full analysis on an entire DSP report.

177
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,160
This case remains speculative.

178
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,000
Our next case with ties to the DSP and fast walkers will actually be familiar to fans

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,960
of my channel yet will likely shock you, the 1976 Tehran UFO encounter.

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,380
For those of you who have not seen my first grounded flight due to UFOs video, I recommend

181
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,760
checking that out.

182
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:53,520
So here's a clip on one of my all time favorite UFO encounters.

183
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:02,640
The link to fast walker was done by researchers Lee Graham and Roger Rager, satellite sensor

184
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,160
technicians at Aerojet in California.

185
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,960
They themselves confirmed that the UFO sighting over Tehran was in fact tracked by the United

186
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,520
States military DSP satellite.

187
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,320
During their investigations, Graham and Rager located a computer printout from the timeframe

188
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,040
of the Iranian UFO overflight, which shows that the DSP satellite definitely detected

189
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,840
a quote anomalous object in Iranian airspace.

190
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,000
After a long and fruitless venture to confirm these claims finding nothing besides a declassified

191
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,080
paper often referenced by Rager titled, Now You See It, Now You Don't, by Yousaf Captain

192
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,480
Harry S. Shields, I was finally able to begin to pull on the strings of the evidence Graham

193
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,640
and Rager proposed.

194
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,840
Within the NYCAP report of the 1976 Tehran incident, there exists a link to a long dead

195
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:06,320
email chain between Brad Sparks, an early founder of CAUS, the Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,

196
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
and blog owner RJ Kohen.

197
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,320
Here Brad raises concerns about DSP-1 detecting the UFO in the 76 case and questioned whether

198
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,680
the satellite actually captured the Mirage F-4s scrambled to pursue the UFOs instead.

199
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,920
Spark references a quote, out of focus graphic image, end quote, that only gives the date

200
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,200
not time of the event and states quote, 238 scans possible SR.

201
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Since DSP scans once every 10 seconds, this means that DSP scanned an object for 39.7

202
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,000
minutes and the SR term listed may refer to strategic reconnaissance.

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,280
After going deeper, I was able to find an email chain from the now also defunct VirtuallyStrange.net

204
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,760
dating back to 1998, which references the DSP connection in the 1976 Tehran case.

205
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,840
This email states quote, JPEG is available at the above URL, end quote, so at this point

206
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,720
I was finally getting close to finding the actual image.

207
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,240
Following the source of the JPEG takes us to a 1997 blog post on ufoworld.simplenet.com,

208
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,480
titled quote, the DSP connection.

209
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,400
And here we get the out of focus grainy image that supposedly depicts the DSP printouts

210
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,840
highlighting the 1976 Tehran fast walker by Graham Enreger.

211
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,800
Guys, the only things we can determine from this raw image is a similar to structure to

212
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,200
the 1984 fast walker case where the term UCF is referenced multiple times as well and the

213
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,160
aforementioned 238 scans possible SR.

214
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,080
The rest of the image is illegible and frustrating.

215
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,360
Due to my limited graphic experience, I have tried and failed to AI upscale this image to

216
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,200
make the rest of the text legible.

217
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,800
Also my backwards image search yielded zero results.

218
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,280
If you think you can help me make this document legible, please please please email me at

219
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,280
uapgirb.com and let's figure this case out together.

220
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,880
So there we have it, two cases connecting fast walkers and DSP, but both lead us to somewhat

221
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,840
dead ends with insufficient data to further our investigation.

222
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,760
I am going to keep getting to the bottom of this hopefully with one of you, but let's

223
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,160
get some relevant updates to these cases soon.

224
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:44,160
So remember back how Fish mentioned, at the end of the 2014 DSP fact sheet, quote, in

225
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,040
addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard

226
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,160
support system that will aid public safety in the future.

227
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,040
Well guys, the Aerospace Corporation is suspected as one of the legacy private corporations who

228
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,960
engage in, quote, real UAP research.

229
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,100
In ufologist Jacques Fillet's book Hidden Science 5, which accounts for Valet's journals

230
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:17,720
from 2000s to 2009, he along with Kit Green, physicist Hal Puthoff, astrophysicist Eric

231
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,440
Davis and Kristen B. Zimmerman, suspect that Aerospace Corporation alongside Lockheed Raytheon

232
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,880
and Northrop Grumman are among the USG contractors involved with deep UFO work.

233
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,200
And in Ross Colthart's fantastic book In Plain Sight, I would highly recommend reading

234
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,280
that book.

235
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,760
He writes that a source told him about an aerospace company in Long Beach, California

236
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,160
with access to, quote, the wreckage.

237
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,800
The source told Ross, quote, the program was controlled by a relatively small group of

238
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,240
people, not all in government, including people in aerospace, intelligence, and corporate

239
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,680
financial communities.

240
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,520
The source said that the company had sprawling gardens.

241
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,720
And the only major aerospace company in Long Beach, California that has this type of campus

242
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,000
is the Aerospace Corporation.

243
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,120
And remember Colthart is no slouch, he is the man after all who broke the grush story.

244
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,400
And there is much more work to be done investigating the Aerospace Corporation that is not the

245
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
subject of this video.

246
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,520
But it is interesting to see how Space Force and DSP would be analyzing DSP data with the

247
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,720
Aerospace Corporation, a company with possible larger ties to covert UAP study to, quote,

248
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,880
develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

249
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,520
Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today.

250
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,040
I know it just feels like we started to scratch the surface of fast walkers and space bound UAP,

251
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,600
but I wanted to make this video for a brief look into kind of how Space Force, USG,

252
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,600
DOD, NORAD kind of use the terminology of fast walker to skirt around FOIA and how this isn't

253
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,320
a new term.

254
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,440
And we can trace back to the 76 Iran case, the 1984 DSP-1 case to, you know, possibly

255
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,560
lead some evidence to early fast walker detection.

256
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,040
Those two cases are of extreme interest to me.

257
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,400
And if you think you can help me out decipher that terminology, find out where those images

258
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,800
were actually sourced from or AI upscale them to help me figure out what the heck they are

259
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,200
saying.

260
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,960
Please again, contact me at uapgurb at gmail.com.

261
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,480
And I hope you found that Lee M. Graham pretty interesting.

262
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,720
I've actually tried to connect with him on Facebook and so that is pending.

263
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,600
I'd like to hear more about his research into this case.

264
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,320
And there's actually a lot of interesting things surrounding Graham and some claims

265
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,800
he made.

266
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:56,160
I've heard some people liken him to a similar person to a 1980s UFO whistleblower.

267
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,080
So should be some exciting stuff on that if I can actually get in contact with him.

268
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,000
Guys, please remember if you enjoy the video to like or subscribe and leave a comment what you

269
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,800
think about DSP, fast walkers, space bound UAP and so forth.

270
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,160
Thank you guys so much for joining and as always, I will catch you for the next video.
