1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's start from the very beginning.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You say it's a 90 year cover-up.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Just about, yeah.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
90 years?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
1933 was the first recovery in Europe, in Magenta, Italy.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They recovered a partially intact vehicle.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's true, it's real.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, that actually happened.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Italian government moved it to a secure air base in Italy for the rest of kind of the fascist regime

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
until 1944-1945, and the Pope Pius XII back-channeled that.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So the Vatican was involved.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, and told the Americans what the Italians had, and we ended up scooping it.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let me be very clear about this.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're saying that the Catholic Church, the Vatican, they know about the existence of non-human intelligence on this planet.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Certainly.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The first traceable recovery of a UFO occurred 14 years before the infamous cover-up in the desert sands of Nevada.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In fact, in direct statements made by both David Grush and Lui Elizondo, the first NHI craft to be forcibly taken by U.S. forces

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
would arise from the smoldering remains of the Italian fascist state,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
led by none other than bonito Mussolini during the Second World War.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and today we are going to discuss the now infamous 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO crash retrieval.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This tale is both intriguing and perplexing, featuring a rich document trail

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and fascinating historical connections to the regime of Mussolini and the Vatican.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why did Grush specifically reference this case to Ross Colthart in his News Nation article?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Buckle up guys, because today we are going to dive right into the Magenta UFO retrieval.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Before we do any sort of investigation, let's discuss the story, and guys, please forgive any butchering of Italian words or names that I use.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In June of 1933, 14 years before the Roswell crash, an unknown craft crashed or landed at Magenta, just west of Milan, Italy.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The craft was reported to be bell-like, almost resembling a mix between a flying saucer and the Glock, the legendary mythical alleged Nazi wonder weapon.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The craft sat at a reported 10 meters in diameter.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dictator bonito Mussolini thought this was an unconventional flying vehicle that originated from France, Britain, or Germany,

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but the Italian government established a top-secret group, the Gaminetto Ricciare specialise 33,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
or how I'll refer to it from now on so you don't make me say that again, the RS33 to examine the craft.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This top-secret group was actually headed by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini,

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and Foreign Minister Gallezo Siano, Air Marshal Italo Balbo,

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
with scientific support from astronomer Gino Saccini and possibly senator and founder of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Marconi himself initially resisted Mussolini's terrestrial claims, believing the craft to be extraterrestrial in origin.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The craft and its debris was reportedly stored in the hangars of the SIAI Marchetti Aircraft Company in Virgiate Varese.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Journalists were ordered to keep silent about the incident due to national security, citing strict dissemination of information by the Agenzi Stefani,

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Italy's state propaganda papers.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The UFO remained in the possession of Mussolini's regime until the fall of the Axis powers

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and was recovered by US agents of the Office of Strategic Services in 1944 or 1945, and this was the former US intelligence agency.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The magenta case was brought to light by Italian UFO researcher Roberto Pinotti, who in 1996 received original Italian secret documents from the fascist regime,

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
containing both protocol on how to handle the craft discovery, as well as internal Italian government notes on UFO sightings from 1933 to 1940.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The document consisted of both telegrams and handwritten notes.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The sender chose to remain anonymous to Pinotti, going only by Mr. X, the did claim to have inherited them from a family member who worked on Mussolini's supposed UFO program.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Roberto received a series of three internal Italian government telegrams relating to the craft. Let's review each one.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In our first telegram, we see the telegram is sent by the director of special affairs of the Stefani news agency, the only agency of the Mussolini regime, as an official telegram of Milan.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The priority of the telegram is labeled lampo, or highest, with a reservatissimo, a confidential rating.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The telegram reads, quote, by order of the duce, the leader, absolute silence is ordered of the presumed landing of an unknown aircraft on national soil.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The version is to be published with today's dispatch is confirmed. The same version also applies to personnel and journalists.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the state security court. Please confirm receipt immediately.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Our second telegram was set on the 13th of June 1933 at 4 p.m. again from the Stefani news agency, with lampo priority and reservatissimo classification.

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This document reads, quote, by superior order, the news disclosed today in the Stefani dispatch number 63 slash 3 slash 1 dot 0 should be treated as follows.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The above mentioned aircraft has been recognized as a meteor by the Barrera Astronomical Observatory.

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Given the news, the slightest graphic relevance, there is no need to rectify, minimize.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And finally, our third telegram was sent the same day, the 13th of June 1933 with the same priority classification and sender this time at 507 p.m.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This telegram reads, quote, by order of the leader, it is ordered that circulation of the news about the craft of unknown nature referred to in today's Stefani dispatch at 7 30 a.m. be stopped immediately.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It is ordered that any leads for newspapers carrying this news be recast immediately.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the state security court, please confirm receipt immediately.

60
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So with these three telegrams, we see the Italian press demand absolute silence over a landing of an unknown craft.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Immediate arrest and maximum penalties were to be issued to any journalist commenting on the craft.

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
From the telegrams, we can see the Italian propaganda initially pushed for journalists to treat the landing of the craft as an identified meteor.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Only to swiftly cease any and all reporting by Italian journalists. Does this not sound awfully similar to the Roswell incident?

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Quick media control to drown out the presence of a crashed UFO?

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you look at the second and third telegrams I've shown you, you will notice an r slash s stamp in the telegram text field.

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Unfortunately, I can't find any sharp enough images to decipher what exactly the text on this field reads.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
However, remember in the description of the alleged magenta craft?

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A top secret scientific coalition was formed to investigate the craft named the gabinetto richerce speciale 33 or the RS 33.

69
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
In other words, the special group of 1933.

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, within the document sent to Pinotti, we see an introduction directly mentioning the RS 33 as a prelude to two sheets describing protocol for the crash.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Atop the letter in two pages lies the stamp of the Kingdom Senate.

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This intro to this protocol memorandum has been translated by Paulo Guisardi and reads, quote,

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dear DeSanti, I am sending you as requested and agreed verbally the note for your rule.

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Do not make copies. Do not even mention it to your deputy.

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
For any matter having to do with the RS 33 office, come to me first.

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I personally wrote these lines as to not expose them to the eyes of my secretaries, therefore adjust accordingly.

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So who is this DeSanti and who are the figures I mentioned earlier as connected with the RS 33?

78
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
DeSanti, the man to which the craft recovery protocol was addressed, was almost assuredly a pseudonym for one Tommaso David,

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
a colonel of the Frossinone founder of the Volpi Argentante spy group and later head of the Salo Secret Service,

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
as discovered by Italian historian Arrigo Petaccio.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Earlier, I mentioned the possible connection of Guglielmo Marconi to the RS 33, the Nobel Prize winning inventor of the radio.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Marconi was an outspoken advocate for belief in extraterrestrials, pursuing the possibility of contacting them via radio,

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
as outlined in a rare article published in 1937 titled, Guglielmo Marconi, Magician of the Invisible Ruler of Spaces by La Stella Mario,

84
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
which itself referenced earlier claims by Marconi in 1920 and 1932.

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
At this time in 1933, the strict propaganda machine of the Stefani as mentioned earlier would cover everything under the regime bar the highest authorities,

86
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Benito Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and Air Marshal Balbo.

87
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Due to this, it stands to reason the two men besides the Duce would be read into the top secret RS 33.

88
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ciano's likely involvement in RS 33 and direct naming in the fascist UFO sightings post-magenta will become apparent later in the video.

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It is worth mentioning the famous Ciano diaries that describe Ciano's experience and involvement within fascist Italy up to his execution in 1943,

90
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
makes no mention of this secret group. However, it is understandable given the top secrecy of this commission.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What is interesting, however, is a deep rabbit hole between Eta Ciano, Ciano's wife and Mussolini's daughter, Alan W. Doles,

92
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the Ciano diaries and Operation Sunrise. As a front to retrieve the magenta UFO from the crumbling fascist state,

93
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
this is not my research, so I will not pass it off as my own. However, if you guys are interested,

94
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will see if I can do an interview with the really sharp cat who has spent countless hours digging into the craft retrieval process by the United States.

95
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Now onto the mentioned memorandum describing craft recovery to DeSanti in conjunction with the RS 33.

96
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We see these labeled personal note, very confidential, so let's go through all nine steps of protocol surrounding the magenta retrieval.

97
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
One, notify the mayor. Two, order the immediate recovery of the aircraft.

98
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Three, order immediate arrest of all witnesses. Appoint Special Section RS 33 of the OVRA, the Italian Gestapo, present in each provincial capital.

99
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Four, direct all reports with the utmost secrecy and precedence over all priorities to the Central Meteorological Office at La Sapienza University in Rome,

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
exclusive relevance RS 33 office. Five, to prevent ex-officio the dissemination of any news particularly in the press.

101
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Six, for the purpose of the previous point, it is necessary to publish from time to time very short articles in which the phenomenon is reported to its authentic and unique celestial nature.

102
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Meteor, shooting star, planet, luminous halo, iris, etc., according to form RS 33.fz.4 previously transmitted to all the prefectures of the kingdom by special dispatch.

103
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Seven, transmission of reports to the Air Force is subject to the prior favorable opinion of the RS 33 office, whose decisions are unappealable up to the highest hierarchy of the duce.

104
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Eight, strict exclusion of any other scientific body from the collection and examination of the reports available, including the Pontifical University.

105
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And nine, charge all expenses related to this provision to CAP 32 title XXII heading 32-2 of the order to the R-Academia di Italia, written authorization from Chief of Staff RS 33.

106
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And a couple thoughts here guys, points eight and nine sound like protocol almost identical to USAF regulation 200-2 from 1953, which I talk about all the time in which UFO sightings were delegated strictly to the Air Force or higher authorities while restricting cases to be shared with scientific bodies of Project Blue Book.

107
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And all of this operating protocol sounds extremely similar to the alleged MJ 12 or Majestic 12. If you don't know what that is, it is basically the alleged crash retrieval and reverse engineering group that operates with complete autonomy to investigate NHI within the USG.

108
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is a really rough summary as maybe I need to cover the MJ 12 docs, but the RS 33 sounds like an Italian precursor to the US body that would arise in the late 40s slash early 50s.

109
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So, unlike the Stefani telegrams and memorandums, I have no verifiable evidence here for craft storage.

110
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But according to the anonymous sender Mr. X, the remains of the craft were stored in the shed of the SIA Marchetti Aeronautical Manufacturing Company.

111
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The trail here is incredibly confusing, as sometime during the 1943 year, it is proposed the Nazis took control of the UFO and dissolved the RS 33.

112
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A possible link here is that a fire occurred in the SIA warehouse in Virgiat on the 17th of March 1943.

113
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The craft likely was then moved to Mussolini's enormous bunker under Mount Serrate, 27 miles north of Rome.

114
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
At the time of its construction in 1937, the bunker was the largest in Europe, three miles long and 300 feet underground.

115
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Rumors circulated the bunker was used to house military equipment, possibly a recovered NHI craft.

116
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:32,000
On the 8th of September 1943, the Germans executed Operation Auxay, disarming all Italian units and commandeering the bunker for the Wehrmacht command for southern Europe.

117
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
More research needs to be done here to try to find a hard paper trail for the craft, but this is what we're working with for now.

118
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
An additional piece to this already complex puzzle was included by Mr. X to Pinotti.

119
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
These included a series of handwritten notes additionally bearing the seal of the Kingdom Senate, describing a UFO encounter titled Mestre.

120
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
With these is a 1936 Stefani telegram about Mestre stating quote,

121
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Absolute secrecy is required about unidentified aircraft mentioned in the 23-47 Confidential Report. A letter will follow.

122
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Okay, and on to our letter.

123
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We see a curious drawing of a cigar shaped UFO with what appears to be an exhaust tail, not too dissimilar to a rocket engine,

124
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
followed by two saucers with domes like ping pong balls on top.

125
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm immediately reminded of the flying saucer as described by Lieutenant Jacobs and the 1948 Chili's Witted Encounter.

126
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In this UFO encounter, two American commercial pilots reported their aircraft nearly collided with the UFO over Montgomery, Alabama.

127
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The UFO quote looked like a wingless aircraft.

128
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare,

129
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
comically guys Blue Book described this case as a meteor.

130
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Anywho, the text on this scribbled handwritten note was thankfully transcribed by the black vault.

131
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This reads quote,

132
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It was observed in the morning.

133
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was a metallic disc polished and reflecting light with a length of 10 or 12 meters.

134
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Two fighter aircraft from a nearby Air Force Base took off, but were not able to reach it even traveling at 130 kilometers per hour.

135
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It did not admit any sound, which would lead one to consider an aerostat, a balloon,

136
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but nobody knows of balloons that can fly faster than the wind.

137
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I know for sure that it was seen by other pilots.

138
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The report arrived in the hands of Allegible.

139
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then, after approximately an hour and a half of flying over Mestre,

140
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it was seen as a sort of metallic tube, gray or slate in color.

141
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
A drawing by a confidential informant was redrawn by Andre, who, as far as the two A and B drawings are concerned,

142
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
explained that A was described as being like a kind of aerial torpedo with very clear windows and with alternating white and red lights.

143
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
B were two hats, two hats like those used by priests.

144
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They were wide, round with a dome in the center, metallic and followed the torpedo without changing their relative positions.

145
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The prefecture has opened an inquiry, but you can imagine that it will make little inroads and have a similar outcome to that of the 1931 case.

146
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The Duce has expressed his worries, because he says that if it were an English or French aircraft, his foreign policy would have to start all over again.

147
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And Italy wasn't just monitoring its own skies at this time.

148
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Here we can see from the archives of the prefecture in Milan, copies of telegrams from the prefects of the Kingdom of Italy to the government between 1933 and 1938,

149
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
mentioning reports of, quote, unconventional flying vehicles, and show the official attention of the Italian authorities to the problem.

150
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This telegram, signed by prefect Mutinelli, mentions the presence of unknown flying vehicles over Valona in Albania, a country under Italian control.

151
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Of course, every single thing I talked about would be void if the documents were fake, right?

152
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, fortunately, Pinotti took a skeptical approach when he was first contacted by Mr. X.

153
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He had the documents tested by a forensic expert who said the paper and ink was from the period of the 1930s.

154
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Additionally, scientific consultant Antonio Garavaglia shared with Daily Mail, quote,

155
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it can be stated with reasonable certainty that this sample examined in the subject of the appraisal can be considered original and therefore authentic.

156
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Additionally, Italian Reddit user Lowlab5185 was able to lend his hand to the legitimacy of these documents,

157
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
by not only commenting on the writing style matching the futurism era of fascist communication style but also provided two examples

158
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
of official telegram templates used by Italian authorities in the 1930s. See the resemblance here.

159
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Remember how in both the telegrams and the RS-33 protocol mentioned was made of labeling the craft's landing a meteor

160
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
or other meteorological phenomena as directed by the Agenzia Stefani?

161
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Well, check this out. We can actually find direct reporting of this disinformation.

162
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
From our telegrams and testimony, we can conclude the crash or landing occurred on the 13th of June 1933.

163
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
From later that same month, we can find newspapers and magazines that report on inclement weather occurring in the Magenta area,

164
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
severe lightning storms and hail storms that illuminated the night sky,

165
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
such as this paper from the 22nd of June, which reported the week prior a lightning strike that illuminated the night sky

166
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and struck five bricklayers on the Tricetta Magenta Road, now on screen as a magazine illustration depicting the event.

167
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I unfortunately don't have much to go on for the Magenta case connection to the Vatican and Pope Pius XII.

168
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We will have to go off the word of David Grush and reporting done by Christopher Sharp predating Grush in his 2021 article

169
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All UFO disclosure roads lead to Rome.

170
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Sharp writes about how initial relationships between Mussolini and the Catholic priesthood were quite good

171
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and how the Duce confided with Pope Pius XII about the retrieved unknown craft.

172
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The Pope allegedly became uneasy about the craft being in an Italian possession, as Italy allied with the Nazis,

173
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
thus leaking information to the US about the craft.

174
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Due to the Pope's information, the facility which housed the craft was spared from Allied bombing.

175
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This curiously does in fact line up with the bunker serrate we spoke about earlier.

176
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
After the war or the end of 1944, the craft was brought to the US.

177
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Of course, this is all based on reporting and I do not have a paper trail,

178
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but Christopher Sharp is a well-respected journalist within the UAP realm.

179
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
As we stand, we can prove the authenticity of the documents but not yet these anecdotal accounts.

180
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And lastly, my friends, as we opened with a powerful statement by David Grush,

181
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I would like to leave you with an additionally powerful statement by Lou Elizondo.

182
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Kind of gave a few hints before, but Roswell may not have been the first event and well known.

183
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I mean, there's been some reporting internationally as well that there have been some crashed vehicles

184
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and they were obtained by local authorities and there was some scientific study done on them.

185
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I want to be very careful not to go too far down the rabbit hole,

186
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
but I've seen personally some documentation that's very compelling from a particular foreign country

187
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
where they had a recovery of a vehicle and they had some countries conducting scientific analysis on it.

188
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And after World War II, allegedly, parts of that vehicle were brought to the United States.

189
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, I think I know what country that was.

190
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It was in the South American country, I think.

191
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Maybe Brazil, you know.

192
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Damn it, Argentina? I'm not sure.

193
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, it was Italy.

194
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, that's as it was explained to me, I saw some documentation.

195
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Look, you know, I don't want to get too much into, you know, conspiracy side of the house.

196
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There is some documentation that has been validated.

197
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That was that was from Mussolini himself.

198
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And it's, you know, it's authentic.

199
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's been proven to be authentic the documentation.

200
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So certainly interesting.

201
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Hey, guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the 1933 Magenta, Italy case.

202
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Sorry for the little bit of time away.

203
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I had some family in town for their spring break, but now that that's done, we're back in action.

204
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Personally, I find this case scintillating.

205
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's the Roswell before Roswell.

206
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There's a rich paper trail here as shown by Pinotti.

207
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So this is the kind of case I love where we have documents we can dive into.

208
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We can cross reference.

209
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We can see what's going on with legitimate documentation.

210
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So I remember when Grush first went public with his News Nation interview and he referenced this case.

211
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I was gobsmacked, as Ross Colthart would like to say.

212
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And immediately I dove into learning more and as much as I could about the Magenta case.

213
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I find this case particularly compelling, especially the idea that Benito Mussolini,

214
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, thought this was a craft of British or German or French origin.

215
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And I find the description of the clock particularly interesting, this kind of bell shaped saucer type UFO.

216
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I know there were some details added later on by one, I think William Brophy or William Brophy's grandson,

217
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
who claimed that there were bodies uncovered, as we can see in the original documentation.

218
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We find no evidence of bodies, so of course I don't want to include those when I don't have any sort of hard evidence.

219
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm not sure about his claims.

220
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I think this man was involved in some other hoaxes, but I purposefully did not include that in today's video.

221
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And if you guys are interested, I will talk to the gentleman who has done countless hours of work

222
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
into finding the connection process as to how the US retrieved the craft.

223
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I did not cover this because I could not talk about this without basically copying his work.

224
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That would undermine my credibility and undermine the dozens, if not hundreds of hours he has put into pouring through documents.

225
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So that's just not how I roll, I respect the man completely, but I would love to cover that if I can get him on the show.

226
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
As always guys, please remember to like and subscribe.

227
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
This has been a particularly active week in UFOs with the Arrow Report and the D.D. Johnson FOIA request.

228
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So we have a lot to cover coming up guys.

229
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Hope you enjoyed this video and I will catch everybody next time. Thank you.
