960	3200	Okay, let's see.
3200	6200	I think we should be live at this time.
6200	10240	If anybody can hear us in the comments, let us know.
10240	12120	I'm here with Voler Records.
13040	16680	Let's see, this should update the number of viewers
16680	17520	in just one second.
17520	18520	Sometimes it's a little laggy.
18520	19640	Okay, cool.
19640	22320	It looks like we're starting off with 40 people.
22320	25400	If anybody can hear me in the chat, please let me know.
25400	27000	And then we will cut to the chase
27000	29640	because we have quite a bit to talk about today,
29640	31760	quite a bit of really interesting stuff.
32920	34120	Okay, cool.
34120	34960	All right, what's up?
34960	36040	See, Britt and I see you.
36040	39640	So guys, I'm here with Voler Records.
39640	43040	A lot of you probably have heard of some of his work.
43040	45440	I wanted to kind of link up and speak to him today.
45440	48280	Let me just pull up what he's been working on a little bit
48280	51880	so we can kind of get a little bit of baseline
51880	53480	for what we're gonna talk about.
55920	58720	So Voler Records recently, I would say,
58720	60600	when did you start this, about August?
61920	63560	About three weeks ago.
63560	66360	Okay, he has put out an eight-part series now
66360	69160	at this point that covers the relationship
69160	73160	between UAP Legacy Programs, the Bush family,
73160	77520	the 1933 Magenta Case, Dick Cheney, companies like EG&G
77520	80520	and the Carlisle Group, including a part eight
80520	81880	that just recently came out.
81880	83240	I haven't got a chance to read that yet,
83240	85120	so we'll talk about that today.
85120	88000	But the sort of the amount of research here
88000	90680	and the quality of the posting is just so fantastic.
90680	92800	I know he's worked closely with a lot of other people
92800	95520	I've talked to, such as C. Britton in the chat,
95520	100040	363942, Max Parr, Kermit, all fantastic researchers.
100040	103320	So Voler, if you'd like to introduce yourself a little bit
103320	104920	and kind of tell us a little bit
104920	107240	how you got into investigating the phenomenon
107240	110200	and then how you said that all the talk of Dick Cheney
110200	112360	being at the top of the UFO pyramid inspired you.
112360	114960	I'd like to hear how you got into this subject
114960	116840	in this specific research project.
117840	122240	Sure, like a lot of folks been into this stuff
122240	125240	since I was a kid, kind of terrified and fascinated
125240	129200	at the same time, was buying books.
129200	132320	I just turned 44, so I was of an age where it was like
132320	136560	right when, unsolved mysteries and sightings
136560	138000	and all the shows were coming out
138000	139880	and growing up an 80s kid.
141440	142920	Yeah, and I was buying books.
142920	144600	I had a little section on my bookshelf
144600	146480	of like UFO cases and stuff.
149320	153400	And yeah, I never really lost interest
153400	158400	but it kind of came and went in terms of intensity
158560	163320	and yeah, we were talking right before we went live.
163320	168320	I think in 2004, there was the famous case
168320	171360	of the Mexican pilots, I'm pretty sure it was Mexico.
172120	177120	And it's like the seven lights, craft, whatever
177360	180400	that they see and that was a pretty big deal.
180400	184880	And I think that was about the time that YouTube hit.
184880	187040	And so that went pretty viral, you know,
187040	190320	until the point that, you know, it was like Mexico
190320	192560	and Venezuela and a few other central
192560	194320	and South American countries.
194320	198040	And I know it was Sweden and I don't remember who else
198040	199240	but, you know, there was an attempt
199280	201920	to building this kind of international coalition
201920	204200	for transparency, you know, and of course,
204200	207600	the United States didn't wanna have anything to do with it.
209600	213360	And then, yeah, I mean, cut to 2017,
213360	214840	we all know what happened there, you know,
214840	216160	it was such a huge thing.
218360	223360	And then in 2020, you know, with really nothing to do,
224360	229440	you know, I was pretty involved with the protests and stuff.
229440	233240	And I think once a lot of that started quieting down
234640	238000	in the fall, I was just all in on this
238000	240400	because everything else was so messed up, you know,
240400	242120	it was just kind of like, okay,
242120	244560	like we're in a pretty bad spot, you know,
244560	246240	kind of all around.
246240	251240	And so yeah, just a lot of my free time was spent,
251760	254360	you know, watching stuff and listening to podcasts
254360	259280	and just kind of soaking things in and, you know,
259280	260600	we'll talk more about this,
260600	262760	but I think a lot of this has been about, you know,
262760	265360	normalizing a lot of this stuff.
265360	267600	Yeah, I know we were talking about it a little bit
267600	270240	and it's something that's featured heavily in your research,
270240	272800	is kind of calling back to statements Grush has made,
272800	274480	whether on his news nation appearance,
274480	276200	whether at his congressional hearings.
276200	278720	And it sounds like Grush was like a massive influence
278720	279760	for a lot of your work.
279760	282960	And would you say that, especially in July of 2023
282960	285320	with Grush on news nation, the Senate hearings,
285320	289760	that kind of kickstarted you to research this in depth
289760	290800	into a subject?
291880	294720	Yeah, I mean, I would say I was already there,
294720	298960	but definitely, I mean, that changed everything.
298960	299800	Right.
299800	300840	That was such a huge deal.
300840	302840	I mean, Elizondo was a big enough deal.
304680	307320	But yeah, Grush, I mean, Grush spun me out.
307320	308760	You know, I remember I had a whole,
308760	311080	the whole next day I was just like,
311080	314080	in a weird haze almost, you know?
314080	319080	And it was funny because I kept thinking
319560	322680	things were gonna change right away, you know?
322680	325000	And we're still here.
325000	328080	I mean, the lots happened, but you know, I think
329080	332880	so much of this has been about learning, you know,
332880	337040	kind of the way Matthew Pines has been talking about it.
337080	341400	You know, this sort of word of mouth desensitization
341400	344200	and normalization and, you know, you can still kind of
344200	347520	go about your day and, you know, I think
348840	352960	because of the fluid nature of media now
352960	355040	and the way that we consume it,
355040	357920	you can very easily see some crazy UFO video
357920	360040	and then keep scrolling Twitter or whatever,
360040	360880	you know what I mean?
360880	363560	And you're just like, oh, okay, that's pretty nuts.
363560	367480	And then kind of move on, you know, to a degree.
369560	374160	But yeah, I mean, I think, I'm not really sure.
374160	375960	I'll say it was around, we were talking about this,
375960	378000	but, you know, before we started recording,
378000	382160	but I think it was around December
382160	387160	that Ross Coltart did a talk at a library in Victoria
387880	389520	in Australia.
389520	392680	And at the very end, he mentioned EG and G.
392720	395760	And I think it was JT4 and some other stuff.
395760	400760	And I think that was when I got past the cool video part
402040	404040	and started actually digging in to like,
404040	407120	oh, we're talking about, you know, companies
407120	409520	and organizations and agencies and this stuff, you know,
409520	410360	this is a lot bigger.
410360	413600	And I know there were people there before me, you know,
413600	415760	it's funny now, going back, looking through Reddit
415760	417280	and stuff, doing research where it's like,
417280	421200	oh, people were there even before Grush, you know,
421320	422680	they started digging in.
424240	428480	But for me, it was kind of moving past some of the shock,
428480	431640	I guess, you know, and getting to a point where it's like,
431640	433040	yeah, this is more than real.
433040	437160	It's like, there's just, the history of this is a lot bigger
437160	439240	than I think any of us had realized.
439240	441600	Yeah, and that's something I really appreciate about
441600	444440	kind of your work in the eight parts we're gonna talk about.
444440	446560	Videos to me at least mean very little.
446560	449200	And I'm super vocal about this almost every video I do.
449200	451760	It's kind of the hard nose paper trail,
451760	454040	the official documents, the alleged documents,
454040	456600	the alleged involvement of certain contractors
456600	458800	and three little organizations that that's kind of
458800	461520	the research avenues I like to go down to actually kind of
461520	465720	move a conversation forward instead of just going in circles
465720	469800	about some lights in the sky footage or and so forth.
469800	472360	Right, because there's not that much to do
472360	474360	with that necessarily.
474360	475920	No, no, yeah.
475920	479160	But that's why we're all here, you know, to a degree.
479400	483080	So I'd love to just kind of dive into part one here
483080	486600	because part one of your eight part series really starts
486600	488680	to focus on the introduction of the Bush family
488680	491400	and their involvement with the creation of the OSS,
491400	494640	Alan Dolis and then 1933 Magenta, Italy,
494640	497040	Crash Retrieval case, something I've covered a lot before.
497040	501440	So I'd love to just kind of hear some summarization
501440	502400	and points of that post.
502400	504480	If you'd like to share your screen as well
504480	506160	to kind of go through research, we can do that.
506160	508880	Otherwise I can show some stuff because I think
508880	511120	especially the base point here, part one is,
511120	514240	is super consequential, especially with the implication
514240	516960	of the Brown brothers and Harriman and so forth
516960	519240	that I learned from your work.
519240	520080	Oh, really?
520080	521160	Yeah.
521160	526160	So yeah, I having been so active on Reddit a few months ago,
528000	531400	I think it was 363942 started a little private chat
531400	532960	with a few of us.
532960	535680	And that's when we started kind of bouncing things off
535680	537920	of each other, you know, because really it was just them
537920	541200	and Harry's white timeline.
541200	542040	Right.
542040	544760	Like I'm a, you know, I think in terms of narrative
544760	547960	and a literal, you know, editing timeline,
547960	550240	like let's start looking at it like that
550240	552840	and it'll make it easier to piece this stuff together.
554760	557640	So yeah, eventually, I mean, it really was just the last
558880	561880	two or three months maybe that, you know, a lot of that,
561880	565040	it was like, I was seeing Bush's name pop up
565040	567920	in a lot of the earlier research.
567920	571800	And then, you know, we kind of would all keep digging
571800	576440	in different time periods and yeah,
576440	578680	just started coming together more, you know,
578680	581480	and the Brown brothers, Harriman stuff.
581480	584040	I think we were kind of on that.
584040	587200	And then I, it was really just a few weeks ago, you know,
587200	590440	I've been watching a lot of the She-Han interviews
590440	592360	and he had mentioned Bush a few times
592360	595800	and there's the story of, you know, him or Carter,
595800	598200	you know, bringing him in to brief him
598200	602200	and Bush saying, no, and then I,
602200	606320	one of the last interviews he did, got two weeks ago,
606320	608760	maybe it was right before I started posting this.
610440	613320	He pretty much spent his entire hour
613320	615200	only talking about Bush.
615200	616920	Yeah, that was the October 18th,
616920	619920	year right to know interview, I believe so.
619920	621960	It's one of his most recent ones.
623120	624320	Yeah, maybe it was with,
626200	627840	was that the one with Jeffrey Mishlove?
627840	629920	Yes. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah.
629920	632200	And that's where he really starts to dive into Bush.
632200	636400	I think H.W. Bush as well was mentioned by Lou Elizondo
636400	638280	as kind of having some sort of knowledge
638280	639800	of UFO craft retrieval programs
639800	642800	or just an estimate of the UAP situation.
642800	644640	Yeah, I don't know if I saw that, yeah.
644640	646160	But yeah, just kind of,
647600	649440	this whole thing is so crazy, you know,
649440	651520	I think a lot of these, I mean, these posts,
651520	655720	I was just banging them out basically late at night.
655720	657240	You know, I just take up for, you know,
657240	659680	six or seven hours and just like,
659680	662240	I feel so weird walking around with this stuff, you know,
662240	664280	I have to get it out of my head.
664280	667680	So how did you, sorry, I'll keep on Reddit here
667680	669080	instead of Medium, because I'm not signed in here.
669080	671640	How did you start to connect H.W. Bush
671640	673200	and the Bush family to Magenta?
673200	674920	Because Magenta, of course, is a case
674920	676400	for anybody that doesn't know,
676400	679640	is a case that occurred in 1933 in Magenta, Italy.
679640	681480	It was a crash lenticular object
681480	683240	that was taken in by Mussolini.
683240	685080	Mussolini had theorized that this was
685080	688560	an ally of experimental aircraft, American or British,
688560	692080	but some of his engineers, such as the RB,
692080	693240	why can I remember right now?
693240	698240	The RB in a number thought this was sort of an NHI craft
699360	700600	or early thoughts of this.
700600	703160	And then eventually information was channeled
703160	706040	to the Americans from Pope Pius, the I can't remember.
706040	708040	And eventually in the Pius the 12th,
708040	710880	and in the closing years and days of World War II,
710880	712200	somehow the Americans were able
712200	713360	to get their hands on this craft.
713360	715420	So how the heck did you connect that
715420	717460	with Alan Dolos and the Bush family?
718920	721200	So really I have to give most of the credit
721200	725640	to 36, 39 here and Harry before that,
725640	727740	before he kind of dropped his mic on Reddit.
730160	732880	Yeah, I think Dolos had been coming up a lot
732880	734920	and I wasn't even that familiar with him.
735920	739600	And so much of this has been a true history lesson
739600	743800	outside of the topic, in terms of the inner workings
743800	745460	of the CIA and all that stuff.
747240	752000	And it's funny, I've been going back and kind of building,
752000	754480	I've made a couple of supercuts last few days
755600	759440	of times that Grush and other people will discuss this case.
759440	762920	And he explicitly says, like the OSS retrieved this,
763440	765800	when I was in the CIA, et cetera.
765800	767840	So it was kind of put in our hands right away,
767840	771640	but I think some of us had gotten there
771640	776480	in a roundabout way in seeing Dolos pop up,
776480	779680	and then learning about OSS,
779680	783680	and then it was like the more it kept going back,
783680	787640	and even towards the end of this kind of thread series,
787640	790840	it was just like, this is so crazy.
790840	792960	This is all one story.
792960	795880	This is all like a small group of people.
795880	797800	If you go back to Brown Brothers, Hairyman,
799080	804080	it was Herbert Walker who was Prescott Bush's father-in-law.
805560	808960	And Prescott Bush was H.W. Bush's father, correct?
808960	812080	Right, so then it's Prescott Bush
812080	815800	is running that company with Avril Hairyman.
816720	819560	Later, Hairyman goes on to become,
819560	822640	I think he's Eisenhower's secretary of state.
822640	825480	He's calling a lot of shots in the government post-47.
826600	829040	So it's the two of them at this agency.
829040	831680	Eventually, Alan Dolos has lead counsel there.
832760	835160	Some of these folks knew each other from Yale.
835160	837280	There's a huge skull and bones connection.
840360	842200	Yeah, I realized again towards the end of this,
842200	846600	the skull and bones was a primary recruiting source
846600	850120	for the CIA at the behest of Prescott Bush.
851400	853360	Well, you really, I mean, we started to see
853360	857400	how a lot of his power was very, very centralized
857400	858960	within a small group of people.
859960	864360	And that George H.W. Bush was eventually at the head of it.
864360	866400	He's kind of brought him to the fold in the 40s
866400	868400	after he graduated from Yale.
869320	873920	Yeah, and H.W. Bush was as kind of a higher up in the CIA.
873920	876000	He was kept under wraps for a while, right?
876000	878400	Up until his almost presidential run.
878400	880360	Right, and it came out in 88
880360	883600	when he was running for presidency.
885400	887360	There was a paper called The Nation,
887360	889440	I think it's a UK paper,
889440	894440	and the journalist had found out that Bush had lied
894640	897600	about how long he'd been in the CIA.
897600	901640	He said he'd been brought in in 76 as the director,
901640	905200	but really he was traced back to like 61.
905200	908480	And apparently he was briefed about JFK
908480	910600	within the week after the assassination.
910600	913520	And then people have been commenting the last week or so.
913520	917720	There's been some closer connections there possibly
917720	921120	about him being in Dallas and taking a flight around
921120	924280	and making some anonymous phone call and all this stuff.
924280	925600	And yeah.
925600	929320	So one of the things that really kind of part one
929320	933160	of your research relies on is a book that She-Han
933200	936000	was kind of advertising on his shelf during an interview.
936000	939840	This book is called Nazi Hydra in America,
939840	942160	Suppressed History of a Giant.
942160	943880	And this was featured on his shelves.
943880	945160	And throughout this book,
945160	947600	this talks about how Prescott Bush helped
947600	950760	like the Nazis ascension in kind of a,
950760	955760	alongside the Brown Brothers and Harriman and so forth.
955920	957640	So can you talk a little bit more about that,
957640	960480	how Prescott Bush and the Bush family was actually kind of
960480	963720	entwined with the OSS as well as Hitler's ascension
963720	966080	and kind of the fascist party rise in the U.S.
966080	967480	there in the 30s.
967480	968320	Yeah.
968320	973320	I mean, those guys helped fund the business plot in 33,
974360	977680	which was kind of parallel with Hitler at the time,
977680	979600	you know, and that they were trying to basically
979600	983640	overthrow FDR after he was inaugurated
983640	987040	and install, you know, a fascist dictator.
987040	991280	And that failed, you know, sort of Hitler's plan.
991280	994120	And eventually, yeah,
994120	997120	they all forget some of the details
997120	998560	cause a lot of worries, Rushdale.
998560	1002680	But, you know, those guys were at the core of banking
1002680	1006720	and Wall Street and the steel industry
1006720	1011560	and shipping and a bunch of stuff.
1011560	1016680	And yeah, they were actively funding the Nazis.
1016680	1020880	And set up a separate bank basically,
1020880	1022240	specifically for that, you know,
1022240	1024240	and they got in trouble for that later.
1026160	1027520	But it was all the same people, you know,
1027520	1028760	it was Prescott Bush.
1031000	1034880	I think, I don't think Harryman was involved with that.
1034880	1036440	You know, I think he was actually pretty upset
1036440	1038160	because he was Jewish.
1038160	1039960	Or he was Jewish or his wife was Jewish,
1039960	1042440	but he went to Germany and came back
1042440	1047040	and forced his brother to close their office in Hamburg
1048040	1049480	once he saw what was happening,
1049480	1052680	I think in like 35 or 36.
1052680	1055080	So one of the players you also talk about
1055080	1056280	on the American side of things,
1056280	1058880	of course we talked a little bit about Prescott Bush,
1058880	1062240	George H. W. Bush, we'll talk more about Alan Dolis,
1062240	1064160	but is James Angleton,
1064160	1066800	who later on in his life became an OSS agent.
1066800	1069480	This was the kind of intelligence organization
1069480	1071200	that preceded the CIA.
1071200	1074280	Angleton was a child in 33 living in Magenta, Italy.
1074280	1075400	Was he not?
1075400	1076560	He was in Milan.
1076560	1077400	He was like three miles away.
1077400	1078920	He was in Milan, three miles away.
1078920	1083080	Yeah, so possible they were first hand witnesses
1083080	1085040	or they definitely heard about it.
1085040	1086520	And he was the youngest agent
1086520	1088600	under Bill Donovan at the time, right?
1088600	1092040	Yeah, he was like 16 or 17, yeah.
1092040	1095320	So of course, now with these early days,
1095320	1096840	have you been able to make any connections
1096840	1098240	with specifically Dick Cheney
1098240	1101160	and kind of the Bush legacy of the Magenta crash?
1103280	1106960	Only in that Prescott was there.
1106960	1109040	Like Prescott for sure knew about it.
1109040	1114040	And you got Dolis, Donovan, Angleton.
1115200	1117520	Most of these people were Yale.
1117520	1120400	It's like the whole Bush family was Yale, Skoll and Bones.
1123120	1126440	Angleton was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones.
1126440	1129160	Donovan was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones.
1131880	1133800	Dolis, I forget.
1133800	1138800	But they were all part of the same like white elite,
1139920	1144920	university dudes who basically formed the OSS.
1146200	1149200	Right, because of 36, 39, 42,
1149200	1151560	some of the crux of his research in the Magenta case
1151560	1154040	is analyzing Alan Dolis and the good old boys
1154040	1156000	and how they arranged the intelligence
1156040	1157880	to kind of get the UFO out of,
1157880	1159400	whether it was Germany or Italy at the time,
1159400	1160800	but post World War II,
1160800	1162840	specifically revolving around Alan Dolis.
1162840	1166080	That's how most of his research applies.
1166080	1167880	And I find it really interesting,
1167880	1171080	you were able to bring Skoll and Bones into this.
1171080	1172720	If any of you don't know Skoll and Bones,
1172720	1174600	especially for our European audience,
1174600	1177360	Skoll and Bones is a US based secret society.
1177360	1178720	Think of in the early 2000s
1178720	1181760	when Alex Jones infiltrated the Bilderberg group.
1181760	1184560	Skoll and Bones is a Yale society.
1185440	1186720	Who knows what they get up to?
1186720	1189040	I think there's rumors that they burn like an owl effigy
1189040	1191080	or just do very strange stuff.
1191080	1193720	But throughout, it's so strange,
1193720	1195800	but you were able to connect,
1195800	1197320	let me find some of these members.
1197320	1201080	You were able to connect guys like Alan Dolis, George HW Bush,
1201080	1203680	Prescott Bush and so forth to this secret society.
1203680	1206000	How does, would you say Skoll and Bones relates
1206000	1211000	to kind of OSS, CIA and legacy possible programs?
1211840	1215200	I mean, I guess, you know, because it just so happened
1215200	1220000	that it was those guys that were coming out of,
1220000	1222960	you know, not just that university, you know,
1222960	1226160	but that specific, you know, secret society fraternity,
1227240	1228160	whatever you want to call it.
1228160	1232480	And then those were the guys that formed the OSS, you know,
1232480	1237240	and then in 47, those were the guys
1237240	1240000	that formed the CIA post Roswell.
1240120	1242160	So it was kind of like they've been in on this
1242160	1244080	the entire time.
1244080	1246000	Especially cause there's one individual here
1246000	1248000	I'd like you to expand on a little more,
1248000	1252160	Richard Bissell, who declined to be in the Skoll and Bones,
1252160	1255200	but by this I can assume he attended Yale.
1255200	1260200	Tell us what, so tell us what he said to Harold Malmgren,
1261480	1265600	former president, daughter, father, presidential advisor
1265600	1268160	and very, very senior member, Richard Malm,
1268160	1269960	Harold Malmgren, sorry.
1269960	1271080	Right, right, right, yeah.
1271080	1272520	I mean, that was really new to me, you know,
1272520	1274160	I know that went pretty viral, you know,
1274160	1277120	at least in this community when he tweeted that out,
1277120	1282120	but yeah, I think he said in 63 that Bissell had told him,
1282120	1283880	you know, about it an exotic, you know,
1283880	1285960	reverse engineering program,
1285960	1289020	and the era of, yeah, NHI, you know, tech basically.
1290400	1291560	And then it turned out that, yeah,
1291560	1295320	Bissell was at Yale at the same time.
1295320	1297720	He declined to be part of Skoll and Bones,
1297720	1299700	but his brother was in it.
1299740	1304260	So there's a good chance he knew those guys back then as well.
1304260	1307620	You know, he was brought in, I don't know his history,
1307620	1310660	I haven't read that into it, not much into it yet,
1310660	1315660	but you know, in 47, he's asked by Avril Harriman,
1316700	1321700	a brown brother's Harriman to basically run the Marshall Plan
1324620	1327920	and go over to Europe, talk them into borrowing money
1327920	1331640	from the US, you know, for reconstruction.
1331640	1333840	And so you start to see that Bissell, you know,
1333840	1336760	becomes this new figure at the heart of this, you know,
1336760	1341400	and in 50, at some point,
1341400	1343960	he's working for the CIA after that.
1343960	1348960	And I think it's in 54 that he decides that Area 51
1351200	1356200	is gonna be a good spot to test out a new aircraft.
1356800	1359480	Right, Bissell, yes, that's a great point.
1359480	1362600	Bissell proposed the site of Area 51.
1362600	1363440	Right, right.
1363440	1365760	And Bissell told Malmgren, I think the exact quote
1365760	1369080	was of like an other world technologies.
1369080	1370420	That's right, yeah.
1370420	1371680	I know that phrase very well,
1371680	1373360	because of course I have covered an alleged
1373360	1375080	off-world technologies division,
1375080	1377680	and when Malmgren made those outstanding statements,
1377680	1380600	I can't tell you how many people kind of sent me screenshots
1380600	1381440	of that tweet.
1381440	1382280	Oh, really?
1382280	1385520	So he set up the space for Area 51.
1385520	1386560	Right.
1386560	1387560	And then...
1387560	1388400	Oh, sorry, go ahead.
1388400	1392120	Quick with Bissell, I just, I don't remember.
1392120	1393760	I know I think I had included it, you know,
1393760	1398760	it's kind of at the tail end of things, but so 54,
1398760	1403760	he decides on Area 51, 55 versus, I think it was 55.
1407520	1412520	He brings the plans for the U-2 to the Air Force
1413520	1415240	and they turn them down.
1415240	1420240	And so he has CIA pilots test flying the U-2 in Area 51.
1422000	1422840	Right.
1422840	1426440	And what's interesting about that is Area 51
1426440	1431440	and the U-2 program out of Area 51 was also sponsored by,
1431840	1434120	that remote detachment was sponsored by
1434120	1435960	Edwards Air Force Base, California,
1435960	1438040	who was also laterally connected
1438040	1439880	to reverse engineering programs.
1439880	1440720	Right, okay.
1440760	1442960	That's also a very interesting point.
1442960	1445040	So you have in your timeline here,
1445040	1447400	kind of starting in the 1930s with Brown Brothers
1447400	1449400	and Harriman and Bush families
1449400	1451520	and how the Bush family helped Hitler rise to power,
1451520	1454480	but was also instrumental in forming the OSS.
1454480	1457240	You mentioned the Roswell crash in 1947.
1457240	1460520	Come 1948, you mentioned a company called Dresser Industries.
1460520	1462000	How do they play into this?
1462000	1463640	Oh man, yeah, this was huge.
1464840	1468680	This kind of, yeah, this tied everything together later on.
1469680	1474000	So Dresser Industries was a company that was bought
1474000	1478960	by Prescott Bush and Alan Dulles, I think.
1478960	1483960	And they used that company to start Zapata Oil
1486760	1491760	in I think 51 and they put George H.W. in charge of that.
1493120	1495880	And so this is where a lot of the things where it's like,
1495880	1499640	oh, okay, the same people that have access
1499640	1504640	to this exotic tech are the same people who started Big Oil.
1507600	1510600	So they're running things in all directions at the same time.
1510600	1513600	And they're also, of course, directly involved with the CIA.
1514680	1516440	So you can start to see that
1516440	1519240	these things are all part of the same story.
1519240	1523280	That's something that, although he's quite controversial,
1523280	1525760	that Steven Greer talks about quite a bit.
1525760	1527520	I know in his redacted witness list,
1527520	1530040	he has witnesses from companies that I'm highly suspecting
1530040	1532480	or something like a general electric
1532480	1534880	who talk about knowledge of suppressed kind of
1534880	1538120	exotic technologies to kind of reinforce the oil industry
1538120	1540880	and continue dependence on oil and so forth.
1540880	1542120	Oh, interesting, okay.
1542120	1545760	As well as other companies like AT&T and Bell Labs.
1545760	1549120	So Greer talks a lot about kind of tight energy
1549120	1552480	and oil tycoons having knowledge of exotic technologies,
1552480	1554400	but continuing the suppression.
1554400	1555240	Oh, interesting.
1555240	1556480	Okay, that makes sense.
1556480	1561160	Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, this is when, you know,
1561160	1562400	things start getting really crazy
1562400	1564520	because you start to realize like, cool,
1564520	1566960	this is just kind of one empire
1566960	1568920	that's been running the whole show.
1568920	1573600	You know, and as far as dresser industries in the 90s
1573600	1578600	when Cheney, oh, there's so many players now I'm gonna forget.
1580160	1582800	That's all right, there's so many people.
1582840	1586960	Cheney was secretary,
1586960	1591640	Cheney was secretary of defense for Bush.
1591640	1592600	Is that right?
1592600	1593440	Yes.
1593440	1596800	But George HW and at the same time,
1596800	1599600	they're making oil deals and arms deals and stuff.
1599600	1602080	And he's doing stuff with Halliburton.
1602080	1606200	And then after George, after Bush loses,
1607320	1610920	I think Cheney goes in a private industry for a little bit.
1610920	1615920	And in 98, Halliburton merges with dresser industries.
1617520	1619000	So that's when you start to see
1619000	1621400	these like legacy families come together, you know,
1621400	1624200	the Bush empire that had been going on for decades.
1624200	1628160	And then this new Cheney empire that started,
1628160	1629680	I don't know, I guess in the 80s, you know,
1629680	1631720	maybe there's more business dealings before that,
1631720	1635760	but you start, you know, and you see in 98,
1635760	1637520	like that's when they joined forces, you know,
1637520	1638800	before the election.
1638800	1641120	That's fascinating, research trails like that
1641120	1642720	just kind of uncovered.
1642720	1644880	I'm astonished you were able to pick on
1644880	1647240	some of these intricacies like dresser industries
1647240	1648080	and so forth.
1648080	1648920	Oh, it was so crazy.
1648920	1650280	Because every, I mean, you know, again,
1650280	1652920	I was just staying up late and doing this
1652920	1657640	and it was really hard to keep track of it all,
1657640	1661080	especially because I was writing it out, you know,
1661080	1662880	kind of as I found it, you know,
1662880	1665000	because it was still astonishing.
1665000	1668800	And I was worried if I didn't get it all down
1668800	1671800	and post it, I'd forget it because I was just,
1671800	1673760	there was so much information involved, you know?
1673760	1676600	So that's why I actually started this,
1676600	1681600	the night that that tweet about Cheney came out
1681640	1682960	because I was like, oh, okay,
1682960	1685280	this is, there's something really, really here then,
1685280	1687080	you know, I have to really get this out of my head
1687080	1689240	and get it all down.
1689240	1692120	And yeah, just the more I kept digging,
1692120	1693880	it was just like, oh, like every time,
1693880	1696280	every single time I was writing these out, you know,
1696280	1699120	I was just like, this is all completely insane.
1699120	1700440	Now, I find it so interesting.
1700440	1703200	What was the interview in which the interviewer states
1703200	1706200	that Grush said that Cheney sat on top of the pyramid?
1706200	1707520	What, who was the interviewer?
1707520	1709160	I can't remember the show.
1709160	1710560	I was Walter Kern.
1711440	1714800	Walter Kern is, I think, the editor,
1714800	1717960	editor-in-chief of the County Highway,
1717960	1720200	which is the new print-only newspaper
1720200	1723360	that came out last summer.
1723360	1727080	And I think the second issue did that interview with Grush
1727080	1729440	that I didn't know about till a few months ago.
1729440	1732360	And then, of course, there's the 2000, 2001 radio show
1732360	1734120	in which a researcher, Grant Cameron,
1734120	1738080	who from a presidential UFO called in,
1738080	1739640	asking Cheney about programs.
1739640	1741440	And Cheney said, if I was briefed into one,
1741440	1744080	it'd probably be classified and I couldn't talk about it.
1744080	1744920	Right, right.
1744920	1746200	And I might have forgotten to include it,
1746200	1749720	but four years later in 2005,
1749720	1752840	there's a story I found from the Herald Tribune
1752840	1756520	where Cameron was trying,
1756520	1757960	I think he was trying to fly,
1757960	1760920	he flew into California to attend
1760920	1763600	some UFO convention or something.
1763600	1767080	And I think he wanted to try and track down Cheney
1767080	1768880	and custom stopped him
1768880	1771200	and they made him go back to Canada.
1771200	1772880	Oh, I haven't read that.
1772880	1775760	Yeah, I might have forgotten to include that in the post,
1775760	1779560	but, so yeah, I mean, Cameron knows a lot of stuff,
1779560	1781080	you know, obviously.
1781120	1784280	Have you had a chance to dive into his file base?
1784280	1786560	I used a lot of his internal research files
1786560	1788280	for my Kecksburg research.
1788280	1791600	No, I feel like I'm actually behind on a lot of people
1791600	1793320	as far as the stuff goes,
1793320	1796800	because it's like, I think we're all just consuming
1796800	1798280	different things at different times.
1798280	1799880	And then, you know, that's when we start
1799880	1801520	to kind of boltron it all together.
1801520	1802360	Right.
1802360	1805800	You know, because that's, it's just so big.
1805800	1808640	You know, and I think that's the point, you know.
1808640	1810200	I wouldn't be too hard on yourself there.
1810200	1813240	Cameron has, I think he posted a picture of his office
1813240	1814920	before he uploaded all of his documents
1814920	1817880	and he had an entire office filled with just papers.
1817880	1820400	I don't scratch the surface of going through his files
1820400	1824880	on Eric Walker, Lyndon B. Johnson, and kind of James Webb.
1824880	1826800	So there is so much more to go.
1826800	1828800	I don't even know how any of those people are involved.
1828800	1830240	Yeah, so.
1830240	1834680	So let's, now let's hop on to part three.
1834680	1836920	A part three and four, I think we're actually combined,
1836920	1837760	right?
1838760	1840080	Yeah, I posted them.
1840080	1841360	I think I was having trouble.
1841360	1843960	I was posting too soon or something.
1843960	1844440	Oh, OK.
1844440	1848040	Yeah, because I got, I saw one post was wrong.
1848040	1851040	And I just, I wrote them both pretty quickly.
1851040	1854800	So in part, what was the crux of kind of part four
1854800	1855640	that you were talking about?
1855640	1858520	You mentioned a lot more on the players of Alan Dolis,
1858520	1861040	his death, you were talking a little bit about Gerald Ford,
1861040	1863640	which was pretty interesting, the church committee,
1863640	1866240	and so forth, a little bit about Cheney and Rumsfeld.
1866240	1868480	So what was a little bit of the crux of your research
1868480	1870960	here in this part?
1870960	1873880	Yeah, I think that was, yeah, again, I mean,
1873880	1875680	these were almost extreme of consciousness.
1875680	1878120	I don't really remember exactly.
1878120	1878400	Right.
1881040	1885120	I think it was tracing back how everybody knew each other
1885120	1889920	and knew probably about this subject.
1889920	1896080	And so you've got Nixon, who was Eisenhower's VP.
1896560	1899520	And Eisenhower, very famous stories about him
1899520	1904960	and possible meetings and agreements and stuff.
1904960	1909200	So of course, Nixon probably knew something too.
1909200	1915360	And then I'm forgetting exactly, but I think it was in the 60s
1915360	1925920	that Ford and Cheney and Rumsfeld first all met working.
1926400	1929040	Whatever they were doing, I forget exactly now.
1929040	1933440	But those guys go back to the mid-60s, basically.
1933440	1937920	And then in the 70s, when Ford takes office
1937920	1944400	after Nixon resigns, he installs Bush, a CIA director,
1944400	1946720	following the church committee.
1946720	1949760	Basically, the CIA was in shambles post-Watergate.
1949760	1950800	They were completely busted.
1950800	1953440	And so they installed Bush.
1953520	1957840	After Bush has had this very strange career of having,
1957840	1960720	I think he was in office for two years as a senator or something.
1960720	1966960	And then he's the envoy to China or ambassador to China
1966960	1971200	and some other cushy role and just kind of strange stuff there.
1971200	1981120	And then so at that time, you've got Ford, Bush, Rumsfeld
1981200	1986800	was, I forget, like Secretary of State maybe for Ford.
1988000	1991840	And then Cheney becomes White House Chief of Staff,
1991840	1993040	if I remember correctly.
1994720	1995360	Right?
1995360	2000880	Yeah, I think Cheney was a staffer for Rumsfeld.
2001760	2005360	And so then when Rumsfeld is given the role of Secretary,
2005360	2006800	if I think it's Secretary of State,
2007600	2012240	he recommends that Cheney take over as Chief of Staff.
2013040	2014880	So you've got all of these guys.
2014880	2018960	You've got Bush, Ford, Cheney, Rumsfeld going back.
2018960	2022720	And then here you talk a little bit also about Jimmy Carter
2022720	2025520	and also his involvement with Sheehan, which I found so interesting.
2025520	2028080	Because of course, before he took office,
2028080	2030240	Carter was pretty outspoken about UFOs
2030240	2031840	and wanting to investigate the situation
2031840	2033680	because he had his own personal siting.
2034320	2036160	And then while he was president,
2036160	2038720	Carter wanted to move a little bit off of oil and so forth.
2038720	2042480	And according to Sheehan, I've talked about this a few times,
2043360	2044880	Sheehan was sent by Jimmy Carter
2044880	2047600	to access the classified section of Blue Book files.
2047600	2049120	And that is where the infamous story,
2049120	2052800	he saw a photo of a crash retrieval with symbols drawn on it.
2052800	2055360	You mentioned Michael Schrat's drawings of those.
2055360	2058720	I kind of wanted to bring those up too while we discuss this incident
2058720	2060000	because this is great.
2060000	2063360	So Michael Schrat, I think, held a drawing competition for the alleged.
2064320	2066400	Crash that Sheehan discussed.
2066400	2069280	And I think this was 79, right? 79?
2070560	2071680	No, it's a 77.
2072800	2075520	So the story that Sheehan has been telling is that
2076480	2080400	I think it was like nine days after Carter was elected.
2080400	2082560	That was kind of a prime interest to him.
2083360	2087200	And he summoned Bush down to his home at Savannah.
2088080	2091280	And just asked him, like, cool,
2091360	2093280	what's going on with this UFO stuff?
2093280	2096000	And Bush told him, like, I'm only going to tell you
2096000	2097440	if you keep me on as director.
2097440	2099120	Carter said, no, it's fine.
2099120	2106400	So he ousted Bush when he took office and then had Sheehan go into the Blue Book.
2107440	2108880	However, that worked out.
2108880	2111120	He actually got in and found this photo
2111120	2112800	and made that drawing and everything.
2113360	2115440	And then there's the famous story, of course.
2115440	2118960	I don't know if this is validated or not of Jimmy Carter
2118960	2123600	receiving some sort of briefing to some extent on UFOs
2123600	2126400	and basically was left in a catatonic crying state.
2126400	2128560	I don't know if that story's been substantiated or not.
2129120	2130800	I mean, that's I'm looking into that.
2131440	2133040	Yeah, I mean, it's pretty popular.
2133040	2136880	And I think, oh, man, I forget.
2138560	2140480	Somebody had commented recently that, yeah,
2140480	2143040	one of those other guys may have been like in the room
2143760	2144480	when he got that.
2145600	2147760	OK, I forget who exactly.
2148320	2150400	And I don't know if I put it in any of the threads.
2150400	2152000	I think it was after I wrote all of this stuff.
2152800	2155680	But yeah, I mean, if you look at the 77 timeline,
2156880	2159840	so he so Bush is out as director.
2162560	2168880	And Carter does away with the Atomic Energy Commission.
2170160	2171760	There's some other particulars yet.
2172400	2176000	That splits into the DOE and NNSA.
2176000	2180080	A lot of people don't look at records or pay attention to the NNSA.
2180080	2183280	They only pay attention to the DOE in regards to legacy programs.
2183280	2185040	However, especially back in the 80s,
2185040	2189600	NNSA was a cataloging reports of UAP over nuclear sites throughout the US.
2190800	2191840	Oh, interesting.
2191840	2192560	OK, I didn't know that.
2194480	2196640	So sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
2196640	2198080	You were talking about 1977.
2198080	2204560	I mean, I think what makes sense to me is that he goes to Bush, gets denied,
2205120	2205920	Bush is out.
2205920	2210080	He does away with the Atomic Energy Commission, I think,
2210080	2211920	in like right away, February or March.
2213280	2214720	He has she and go in.
2216320	2217040	I forget.
2218160	2219760	I think that might have been March as well.
2221520	2228720	I think Carter gets briefed in May or June,
2230080	2234160	and then immediately signs into law the DOE.
2234960	2239360	And the DOE becomes established in mid-August, I think.
2240800	2243280	And so it's like, who knows this tech exists?
2244480	2246480	He's coming off of the oil crisis.
2247120	2250160	I'd done it for a completely different project years ago.
2250160	2252880	I did a lot of research into that stuff, OPEC and all that.
2255120	2258880	So I think there's a very clear timeline in that Carter knows this is all real,
2260000	2263360	and he knows we can be doing something better and we can be off of oil.
2264000	2267840	But I think the grand irony is that he establishes the DOE,
2268800	2272080	which is set up at the James Forest Hall building of all places.
2273920	2279200	And then they use the DOE just to keep hiding all the same stuff.
2279760	2280000	Right.
2280560	2284640	Yeah, of course, in 54, there's the Atomic Energy Agreement, which to this day
2286160	2290160	keeps materials from ever being declassified UAP materials as they can be
2290240	2293920	misclassified as transnuclear foreign material.
2293920	2297840	And then, of course, the DOE and NNSA have other regulations.
2297840	2301840	So I was surprised to learn in one of my recent projects was of some of the
2301840	2307440	hypothetical reverse engineering and craft programs out at Nellis Area 51 and so forth,
2307440	2311440	that DOE owns much of the land there in the Nevada test and training range.
2312560	2312880	Right.
2312880	2314640	And yeah, I learned a lot of that recently, too.
2314640	2317680	I think they also own the land at Los Alamos.
2317680	2322080	And so that's kind of this weird deal where they own the land,
2322080	2327040	they lease it to the contractors, and I think also to the military.
2327680	2333280	And so they are kind of the umbrella over a lot of this stuff.
2334320	2340800	And I don't understand like what it means if they, you know, was admitted by,
2341760	2343520	was it Stephanie Granholm?
2344160	2344800	I think so.
2345760	2349840	With a, you know, Birchhead and Luna Cornerher, you know, make her admit that the DOE
2349840	2351440	works with JSOCs in times.
2351440	2357440	And his famous story of the firefight between JSOC and Lockheed,
2358160	2361360	and Coltart even validated that a couple of weeks ago and said,
2361360	2363040	yeah, that might not be the only one.
2364000	2367360	So I'm still kind of making sense of a lot of that stuff.
2367360	2372240	The DOE to the contractors and the military.
2372320	2380560	But then the, how does the DOE then have its own retrieval team apart from those people?
2380560	2380800	Yeah.
2380800	2383920	And I think that retrieval team is likely the NEST teams,
2383920	2387440	something I've talked about a couple of times in the Jonathan Waygant story.
2387440	2388320	Have you heard of NEST?
2389520	2389840	Yeah.
2389840	2391520	The Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
2392320	2397280	So one of the interesting things is, guess which company NEST is?
2397280	2401520	One of the contractors NEST is housed out of EG&G,
2401520	2403280	which we'll talk about in one second.
2403280	2408240	So DOE has even more ties, because I can't wait to launch into this part,
2408240	2412080	because this is where I think I can add a little bit of really interesting pieces.
2412080	2415520	Tell me how the heck you connected EG&G and the Carlisle Group into this,
2415520	2419520	because the Carlisle Group especially, I don't think nearly enough people talk about.
2419520	2422160	And once we talk about that, I'm going to give a,
2422160	2427120	I'm going to connect Carlisle Group to modern day disinformation with Sean Kirkpatrick.
2427120	2429440	So that'll be a bit fun.
2429920	2432320	Okay. I've been curious like where they stand now.
2432320	2439200	Okay. So yeah, it was when Ross gave that talk and ended it with bringing up EG&G.
2440560	2445440	So EG&G was a high speed photography company, run by three guys.
2446000	2447760	Like those were their initials, funny enough.
2449440	2454640	And they were brought in to film the nuclear test.
2455440	2459280	And I think it was also because of them probably that they were catching,
2459280	2462960	you know, the craft or orbs or whatever was showing up around these test sites.
2464080	2465520	And who knows what else they caught.
2465520	2470880	And then post-Roswell, you know, I think it was, there was like December 47
2471840	2473920	at the behest of the military.
2474960	2481040	They were basically asked to become, I'm forgetting now,
2481680	2484960	like a joint enterprise or something so they could be contracted out.
2486080	2487440	However that stuff all works.
2488160	2494640	And so it sounds like basically they became the lead contractor.
2495840	2500240	Like they were where things went, partly where things went private kind of right away.
2501280	2507200	That the military could do what they wanted, but all the paperwork was at EG&G basically.
2507920	2513360	And and then, you know, wherever people will stand on the czar and all that, you know,
2513920	2520000	I think it was Bob Echler, you know, who said back in the 90s that EG&G was his employer.
2520000	2525760	They are basically the employer area 51, you know, and they run Janet Airlines.
2525760	2528080	You know, it's like they kind of run a lot of that show.
2530240	2537040	Which that that confirmation of EG&G working or employing people at area 51 was later confirmed
2537040	2540880	and who we'll talk about in a second with Eric Tabor and his Aero testimony.
2540880	2542880	Oh, interesting. Okay. I'm not familiar with that.
2544080	2547920	EG&G also interestingly enough, as I'm sure a lot of people know,
2547920	2552080	is the parking lot where Admiral Thomas Wilson and Eric Davis met
2552080	2555040	for the classic Wilson Davis notes, which is great.
2555040	2558560	So you here in this post connected Ross Colthardt.
2558560	2565440	And we kind of started off talking about this within this engineering badge from area 51 here.
2565920	2567120	What did you take away from this?
2567120	2571920	And then we'll talk about Eric Tabor, who this was his patch from his great,
2572960	2575120	it was from his great uncle, I believe it was.
2575840	2578640	Oh, right. Is he the guy? That's right. Okay.
2579360	2583600	I think he saw it and then after his uncle died, like his uncle told him a story or something.
2584400	2585040	Right. Right. Right.
2588000	2593840	Yeah. This is again, you know, when I first saw this Colthardt straight up says like,
2593840	2596560	oh, the internet's going to go crazy over this. Right.
2596560	2600960	And I don't remember really seeing many people talk about it at all. No.
2600960	2605440	So I posted it back then, just like, what does anybody think this means?
2606320	2611520	And people just came at me for getting the Star Trek references wrong. Oh, really?
2612480	2618000	And I was like, Star Trek, take, take, take their stuff seriously.
2618000	2622000	Yeah. I mean, sure. You know, it's just like, that's a very ancillary part of this.
2622000	2629920	But he does say that, you know, that I forget what it is. It was at 1-1-0-0, 1-0-0-1. Yes.
2629920	2638160	So it's a reference to a specific next generation episode about the binars who steal.
2638160	2645360	I watched it a couple of times after I read this, the binars who steal the enterprise
2646320	2652880	to go help their planet or something. And it ends with like, why didn't you just ask us for help?
2652880	2658560	Right. And I think it's like Picard and I'll get the other guy's name wrong.
2660240	2664640	They're like, oh, we didn't, there was some, yeah, I think they asked the binars,
2664640	2667280	like why didn't you just ask us for help? And they're like, oh, we didn't know if you would.
2667280	2673920	So we just kind of, you know, did things on our own. So I don't know. I mean, maybe that's part of
2673920	2684800	the story that some faction of NHI or something are, you know, getting help without our agreement.
2684800	2689680	Or I don't know. I really don't know, you know, and then, but I did see digging into this more
2689680	2695120	than Measure Analyze Protect. It might have been C. Britton or somebody else who'd found that
2696000	2698080	that phrase comes up a lot in a lot of the DOE.
2698960	2705600	So for anybody watching that doesn't know the story of this patch, this originated from Arrow
2705600	2712480	Whistleblower who conveniently wasn't mentioned in the historical report. Eric Tabor, who I think
2712480	2719600	in 2023, he testified to Arrow that his great uncle, I think his last name was Eurekart or something,
2720240	2726640	he worked at Area 51 in the capacity of a sergeant from 1997 to 2014 as the head of
2726640	2734160	security for like a radar cross-section facility at Area 51. And here he was privy to like images
2734160	2740560	and photographs and so forth of a classic egg-shaped craft that according to what the
2740560	2745920	uncle told Eric Tabor was just found abandoned in the desert. So supporting kind of the donation
2745920	2750720	theory that Grush talked about, a seamless egg-shaped craft, maybe the size of a family car.
2750720	2754240	Let's see if we can find an image of it because I actually have the article pulled up here and
2754240	2757840	I'm sorry for the Daily Mail's ad pop-ups. I don't have an ad block right here. Yes,
2757840	2765280	I use this image quite a bit. This is Eric Tabor. What year was that? His uncle, Eric Tabor,
2765280	2772160	testified in 2023. Sam Yerka, I cannot pronounce that last name on the fly, was an Area 51 contractor
2772160	2779200	from 97 to 2014. And Tabor is like an aerospace engineer, pretty well respected. Sorry, let me
2779200	2784800	find images of that patch. Yeah. Wait, did he say when he saw that craft? No, I can't remember.
2784800	2790880	He didn't give an exact date during the time. But of course, Tabor says his uncle was a contractor
2790880	2797600	at Area 51 on the behest of EGNG. Which is to me part of, I mean, every now and then there's some
2797600	2804720	kind of cosmic humor in this that you've got, you know, an egg-shaped craft at, you know, EGNG
2804720	2809520	facilities. Oh, okay. So actually, maybe we do have a date. He said when he first got there in
2809520	2814960	1997, I had a personal conversation with a senior EGNG engineer whose group was tasked with trying
2814960	2819840	to reverse engineer an object that was brought there by some CIA people in the 1980s. Which
2819840	2826400	that's interesting to me because that might talk about the CIA and CIA, OGA and JSOC participating
2826400	2834160	in retrievals even before kind of the start of the OGA in 2003. Right. 2002, 2001. But that of
2834160	2839760	course is for foreign retrieval. So who knows who knows what kind of a retrieval the CIA may have
2839760	2846160	had their hands in. Yeah, eventually. Do you know when and I was trying to find this the other day
2846160	2854720	when in 2003, OGA became its own agency? No, I'm trying to think back to Chris Sharpe's reporting.
2855280	2858800	But I can't remember exactly when I don't know if a date is listed there.
2859760	2864400	Because I, yeah, I think it's, well, you haven't read part eight yet and that's when things get
2864400	2871280	really fun. Okay, okay. So we'll continue on so we can get to part eight. Now, one of the companies
2871280	2878720	that ran EGNG from 1997 to 2001 that you bring up is of course the Carlisle Group. The Carlisle
2878720	2884880	Group has been implicated many times as one of the lead proponents of the control group of the UAP
2884880	2889200	topic. What did you find out about the Carlisle Group within this within this piece part five?
2891280	2897520	Oh, man. I'm not sure how some of that info was divvied up between these.
2899360	2905760	Yeah, it just really stuck out to me that they were so they make a they made a deal
2906160	2919920	in 96 with the Saudis, Saudi royalty. And that money goes back to the Bush family back to
2921280	2926480	at least 51 with Zapata oil. So those guys have been working together a long time. And
2928160	2932960	I think over time, EGNG kept getting split up into like different
2935760	2943040	not branches, but like different subholding companies or something. Right. And so it just
2943040	2951360	stuck out that you've got, you know, Carlisle, it turns out that their board was Bush,
2953920	2963280	his secretary, State James Baker, UK Prime Minister, John Major. Oh, really? I didn't know that.
2964240	2970800	Carlucci, who was part of his staff. And I'm forgetting another guy who was part of his staff.
2970800	2979120	So it was like Bush and three of his top White House people all basically at the head of Carlisle
2979120	2986880	Group alongside billionaire and chef Rubenstein. Right. So in 1987, David Rubenstein, he was the
2986880	2991440	domestic policy advisor to Carter when he started the Carlisle Group. That's right. And
2992080	2996400	that's funny. You mentioned Frank Carlucci. I need to know if one of my guys Kai is in the chat
2996400	3002080	right now. Kai is really big into the subject of ARV as Greer puts it. And that mention of Frank
3002080	3006960	Carlucci, if he's here, I need to bring something up to him real fast because Frank, the specific
3006960	3011360	mention of Frank Carlucci with the Carlisle Group is what I think is one of the most
3011360	3015520	consequential mentions here. I know it's, I know it's like a one sentence thing when you got heavy
3015520	3020960	hitters like Rubenstein and the Bush family and the dozens of Saudi investors within Carlisle Group.
3021040	3028000	But how familiar are you with the Mark McCandless story? And Kai, if you're in the chat, please
3028000	3033040	comment because I know you're going to love this. Maybe if I got a refresher, I feel like the name
3033040	3038160	sounds kind of familiar, but yeah. Okay. So Mark McCandless was an aerospace illustrator who
3038160	3044240	testified at Greer's disclosure project briefing in 2001. Mark McCandless did tons of aerospace
3044240	3049600	work, was a very well respected artist with Lockheed Martin various defense contractors.
3049600	3057120	In 1988, his fellow aerospace illustrator, Brad Sorensen invited Mark McCandless to go to Norton
3057120	3062560	Air Force Base, California for an air show. McCandless had some last minute projects for,
3062560	3067360	I think it was popular mechanics, so he ended up not going. Brad Sorensen, when he went to
3067360	3072480	Norton Air Force Base, saw the air show saw some experimental craft, but he was with an individual
3073120	3081040	that he described to Mark later on. And this individual and Brad Sorensen, allegedly, but I
3081040	3084720	think this is far more than just an alleged story because I'm going to cover it in the
3084720	3088560	near future and I have some additional info on this story. I think people might find interesting
3088560	3095600	are taken to a kind of wardened off section of this air base at Norton and admitted by a general
3095600	3100240	or a three, I think it was a two or three star general Air Force general. And the individual
3100240	3105600	that Brad Sorensen is with says that Brad is eight, so they can get in here. There are three
3105600	3110640	flying saucer craft referenced as alien reproduction vehicles. This is where the term is coined.
3110640	3115280	They function off of electrogravity or zero point technologies. They're the they're the classic
3115280	3120080	flux liner design, if you've ever heard of that. Yeah, it's a it's three craft sizes, the smallest
3120080	3125600	one being like 40 feet across, the largest one being like 100 200 feet across, all with similar
3125600	3131600	designs, all with oxygen tanks sitting radially in the crash all craft all with like capacitor
3131600	3136800	plates on the bottom, all with a crew compartment with I think three seats facing around each other.
3136800	3141680	This is a very interesting story because McCandillish made a new let me pull up the
3141680	3144720	drawing of the flux liner just so people can see this while I talk about it.
3146480	3152800	So one one funny thing to kind of backtrack a tiny bit about the Watertown stuff is that
3153200	3163360	that was one of the locations at Area 51. And there's a very specific EG&G office
3164480	3176720	that is opened on July 24, 1969, the day the astronauts come back. Oh, interesting.
3176720	3182160	Office gets established. And then later, I don't know the timeline here, but later,
3182800	3190640	the DOE is at that exact same address. Interesting. Yeah. So the the point I bring up
3190640	3195680	about the ARV Mark McCandillish and Brad Sorenson is because that senior advisor
3196720	3203600	that took Brad to this classified section of this air show was none other than Frank Carlucci.
3204320	3210800	Oh, wow. So that's a really, really, really damn interesting connection because Carlucci is
3210800	3216560	associated with Carlisle Group. Wait, what when was the November 13, 1988.
3217680	3223040	So a year after Carlisle Group is formed. And of course, Mark McCandillish was
3223040	3231280	unalived in 2021. Wait, what's so what's his story? I'm so as an aerospace illustrator after he was
3231360	3236240	talked to by Brad about these designs, he and Brad worked for concept art for the ARV craft.
3236240	3240880	Over time, he would talk about these craft and zero point systems until 2014,
3240880	3245440	a documentary filmmaker named James Allen made a documentary called him called like zero point
3245440	3250160	Mark McCandillish. Towards before the inner before the documentary was ever released,
3250160	3254720	James Allen was diagnosed and killed by a super aggressive form of cancer within the span of
3254720	3260000	weeks. And in his autopsy report, he was also found to have suffered from metal poisoning, heavy
3260000	3265840	metal poisoning. About this same time, Mark McCandillish said he slept with a gun under his bed
3265840	3271600	out of fear for his life. In 2021, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. I think I just
3271600	3278320	heard this the other day or maybe he was catching up on your last on your episode from last week.
3279120	3284000	That's right. I think we talked about that in live a little bit. Yeah. So Carlucci and the
3284000	3291040	Carlisle group may be may be entwined with reverse engineering practices. And how this goes
3291040	3297200	further is you, you're probably pretty familiar with Sean Kirkpatrick, right? Yeah. Do you remember
3297200	3304000	in 2022, 2023, I can't remember exactly when when Arrow did a round table talk with Sean Kirkpatrick
3304000	3309280	and former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie.
3310000	3314960	Yeah. I think I watched that when it came out, but I don't remember any of the details really.
3314960	3320000	So Moultrie was like a huge big wig. It was here. The two said there was nothing to UAP. There was
3320000	3326800	absolutely nothing. Well, Moultrie, as it turns out, sorry, let me reference my notes. Moultrie is
3326800	3332720	a board member for the Better Angels, which was funded by David Rubenstein, the founder of Carlisle
3333440	3340880	Group. And he is a board member in iCapital, which is Carlisle Group's most invested in
3342000	3347840	group. So even Ronald Moultrie now has connections to Carlisle Group. Ronald Moultrie has had influence,
3347840	3353280	or as in cahoots with Sean Kirkpatrick previously as well. Right. Okay. So I found that
3353600	3359360	all with the DOE since he was like 17. So I found that, and then of course goes to Oak Ridge,
3359360	3365840	National Labs, once he leaves Arrow. Well, yeah, I mean, Oak Ridge is the entire loop.
3366400	3374320	Yeah. So just said Vannevar Bush, you know, and I think he got the directions to do that in 41
3374320	3382560	from FDR, sets it up at 42. Whatever the timeline there is for MJ12, you know, and Vannevar Bush
3382560	3389520	and everybody else. And then now we're right back to the DOE and Oak Ridge. Kirkpatrick goes
3389520	3396880	there. And yeah, I just found, I was so happy when I read part five, just with EGNG and so forth.
3396880	3403920	I love that because I think those, so I think those corporations are, EGNG has had some fame
3403920	3408640	because of its association with Bob Lazar, but especially the Carlisle Group. I was so happy
3408640	3416640	you made these ties here. Yeah. And that was, you know, I tried getting there months ago, you
3416640	3423760	know, but I was still just wrapping my head around everything that was coming out. And that was
3423760	3430160	actually where I wanted specifically to get back to. I didn't even intend to make this huge like
3430160	3434160	series or whatever, you know, I was like, oh, let me just get back to the Carlisle, EGNG stuff.
3434720	3439040	And then everything, it was like, as I kept digging, it was like, everything kept growing
3439040	3443920	really fast. Oh man, okay, this is all huge. This is all one story, you know.
3444480	3448240	And then of course, things get even bigger when we get to part six, where you mentioned
3448880	3454080	SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation. Now, did you get a chance recently
3454080	3460320	to see Kermit's post on kind of the financials of UAP legacy programs? And he talks about
3460320	3466320	the startup of SAIC after various SEC regulations, which basically allow corporations to keep two
3466320	3472320	books, one on record, one off record and so forth. No, I didn't see that. No, it's a wonderful piece.
3472320	3477040	It harped back to, I think there was one interview in 2021, Lou Elizondo talked about,
3477760	3481840	he referenced two defense contractors under the pseudonyms company A and company B,
3481840	3488480	and them gaining unfair advantages within the SAIC, I mean, SEC, due to having exotic technologies.
3488480	3496160	Right. Okay. Yeah, I mean, the SAIC stuff, I only really know about because of a still chill
3496160	3505360	drill. They like focus specifically on that eventually, and looking at a lot of the records
3505360	3511040	and stuff. And then going back and forth, we were, again, figuring out timeline, where it looks like
3512000	3521040	basically blue book closes at the end of, I think Alan Dulles dies in January 69. Yeah.
3521680	3526560	And then by the end of the year, blue book closes. And in that time, I've not, I've been
3526560	3533120	able to find an actual month. But at some point, SAIC is started. And so it looks like basically
3533120	3539760	that's where blue book maybe goes private. So now I have a way to circle back to your research as
3539840	3546400	well, kind of with SAIC and Malmgren. And sorry, I'm forgetting his name, Bissell as well. So Bissell
3546400	3550960	tells Malmgren about other world technologies, basically a division that studies other world
3550960	3557360	technologies. I have made a video on an off world technologies division that I with a lot of research
3557360	3564320	highly suspect was ran by SAIC. So now even more, even more parallels to your research.
3564320	3571200	Interesting. So Bissell tells Malmgren this in 63, I think it was. Yes.
3574160	3583840	And then, yeah, SAIC starts in 69. I haven't had a chance to dig into, you know, any direct
3583840	3589280	connections. It's more just like, it's all at the same time, basically. So SAIC is so weird.
3589280	3595120	And I'm sure you heard about all the stuff with Chris Sharpe in his Liberation Times article
3595120	3600400	in Undersea Retrievals, right? Well, he mentions Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, guess who
3600400	3606080	has plenty of contracts with the Office of Naval Research and the NSW Crane, which is the,
3606880	3611840	which is basically a naval research in electromagnetic and expeditionary weapon lab.
3612560	3617760	And Woods Hole SAIC. So SAIC, Kermit and I talk about this a lot, but they kind of have their
3617760	3622320	hands in every single piece of the pie here. So it just makes so much sense that they would kind
3622320	3630560	of fall into your research. Yeah, right. Okay. God, this is, yeah, I mean, yeah, the more this
3630560	3637600	keeps going, I mean, I think to, you know, going back over, you know, just building the supercut
3637600	3643360	stuff, you know, I'm looking to make a proper documentary on the magenta incident and all
3643360	3651760	that. And so I've been going back over, you know, all of Grush's, I mean, outside of Coltart, you
3651760	3659440	know, he did a podcast with Rebedra Panatti and Guzardi and, you know, and then Panatti
3660640	3666000	to the thing with Strieber talked about it. And it's come up a few other times, but
3667120	3672160	I mean, Grush says right away with Coltart, he's like, yeah, it's received by the OSS
3672800	3678240	back panel via the Vatican. OSS becomes a CIA and he throws it out there. You know, and then when
3678240	3685280	he goes on Rogan, Rogan asked him, you know, about this, you know, he's like, oh, I just wanted to
3685280	3691280	show that this goes further back. And it's international. And I thought that was interesting.
3691920	3697040	And you're like, no, you knew what you were doing. You're making sure that like all of us nerds,
3697680	3703520	like really dig into this stuff, you know, because it's not just some other interesting case or just
3703520	3710400	some crash retrieval. It's like everything about who we are as a country and maybe a world kind of
3710400	3717360	starts there. It starts with the Bush clan getting their hands on this, you know, and again, these
3717360	3722960	people starting the CIA, keeping this stuff secret, running a rough shot all over the world, you know,
3723040	3729040	however many coups, you know, they were a part of, you know, just like ugly stuff that is
3729760	3736000	well known, you know, to anyone who reads history at all, you know, and so you start to see like,
3736000	3742800	oh, yeah, this is all like just one big kind of evil empire, you know, that it's like, it's true.
3743600	3748000	And I love the fact that Grush was able to kind of walk things back a little bit because
3748000	3752240	most people who have just kind of a fleeting interest in the subject think of Roswell as the
3752240	3757600	real start of, you know, possible reverse engineering programs when some people familiar with MJ-12
3757600	3765120	might think 1941 Cape Jurado is kind of the nexus point, but Grush walking it back further to 1933
3765120	3771280	Magenta. And who knows, are there possible cases before that as well, such as 1897 of Rora, Texas,
3771280	3776800	or if the claims of Bob Lazar are true, a craft that was found in an archaeological dig and so
3776880	3784880	forth. Yeah, I think I heard really recently that, yeah, Lazar said it came from somewhere in like
3784880	3791920	the Southwest. Oh, did he? I didn't know he gave us. Somebody commented this a few days ago that,
3791920	3796640	yeah, he said something about, yeah, this is really new to me, that I guess, yeah, it was brought in
3798000	3803680	and they think it might have crashed like a thousand years ago or so. Wow, that I've been
3803680	3808320	kept up to date with the kind of, I don't know, yeah. And then the Aurora thing, yeah, I was familiar
3808320	3814400	with, I mean, you know, the airship stuff at that time. And even that's a funny one because it's like
3815200	3823760	the sink crashes into a windmill. Yeah, it's like, it's almost like, like, analogous power in a way,
3824640	3830480	you know, that, that if that was an airship, you know, and it's like, if these things are
3830480	3838960	constantly sort of like pushing us to, you know, advance our science. And then you've got, I mean,
3838960	3845680	I've been reading more lately about radar and death rays, which is like pretty new to me, like
3845680	3853360	radar comes from the search for a death ray, which is basically your first EMP. Interesting. Yeah.
3853360	3859520	So you've got like, Marconi, I'm gonna, maybe I'll do that tonight. Yeah. Marconi, you know,
3859520	3868480	Nobel Prize winner was put in charge of researching your experimenting on the magenta craft by Enrico
3868480	3874480	Fermi of all people who said this whole thing was kind of bullshit. With a famous Fermi paradox
3874480	3879440	that's very lacking. Turns out he said while he was walking with Edward Teller and two other people.
3879440	3885360	So I think he was trying to throw somebody else right at Los Alamos. Yeah, at Los Alamos,
3885360	3891680	I forgot, I forgot about that part. Just learned that recently. But Marconi, you know, he invented
3891680	3902800	radio. And then he was also known for studying electromagnetism in the ionosphere. And I'm
3902800	3907520	really, I don't know if there'd be any way to find out, but I'm really curious if he was testing out
3908400	3911280	his death ray and accidentally brought this craft down.
3911280	3919280	Interesting. And for anybody who doesn't know, Marconi was implicated in the alleged RB33,
3919280	3924640	the internal Italian documents that stated he was kind of the basically in charge of
3925440	3930240	analyzing this craft that crashed in 33. And then in 2024, Panodi came out with more
3930240	3936720	documents vindicating the actual legitimate creation of RB33. So that is, that's pretty
3936720	3943120	interesting. Did you say RB or is it RS? It might be, it's RS. I'm sorry. I was thinking about the
3943120	3948400	RB47 jet while I was talking about that. Because it was a special research. Yes. Okay. Yes. Thank you.
3949280	3954480	And so part seven, this piece was actually taken down. So what, what new, what? Yeah,
3954480	3958880	that just came down a couple of nights ago, because I guess it wasn't UFO-centric enough.
3960320	3964880	What new points kind of, can you talk about that you talked about in this one before we move into
3964960	3974240	eight? I think, where did I end up here? Oh, right. I mean, this was, it's really ended up just being
3974240	3985200	about kind of the crossover between skull and bones. And yeah, there's a, you know, pretty famous story
3985200	3991600	about Prescott Bush was a part of this group that dug up at least what they thought. I don't,
3991600	3995440	I think there were some, it turns out there was some dispute about whether or not it was really
3995440	4003200	him, but, you know, dug up the grave of Geronimo. Interesting. Yeah. Like, like had his skull
4003920	4008240	at their facility, you know, and just some weird black magic stuff there. And so,
4009840	4013440	you know, you kind of start looking at, and then, you know, they start Zapata oil,
4014160	4022720	or, you know, Prescott Bush and Dulles, you know, start Zapata oil in 51 with the help of the CIA,
4022720	4027040	you know, and it turns out it was like a front for the CIA. But even that, it's like,
4029120	4034640	they were sort of like these middle fingers from these white colonizers. It's kind of how I look
4034640	4040000	at it, you know. And so, I think part of what's happening now, even just culturally in general,
4040000	4045120	but let alone this topic and, you know, trying to reveal this true history is like
4046240	4054400	this notion of, like, ugly colonization before we go anywhere else, you know, before we actually go
4054400	4058800	to Mars and beyond, you know what I mean? It's like, we need to do away with a lot of that notion
4058800	4065600	of colonization. And so, I think you start to see, like, that's part of what this whole empire has
4065600	4072240	been from the beginning, you know, just like these white men with power, you know, who's hated more
4072240	4077520	on the planet at the moment, you know. It's like the rich white elite, basically, that have been
4077520	4082560	running things into the ground, you know, and so we get to see kind of where some of that starts,
4082560	4086880	you know, in the modern age at least. And then it's, and then I ended up on Bohemian Grove,
4086880	4092880	and it turns out it's all the same people, you know, it's like all these king makers,
4092880	4098080	basically. And that's kind of the joke, you know, that, like, 36 and still Chill and I talk about,
4098080	4102000	you know, it's just like, oh, yeah, this is what it is. It's just these people wanted to be kings,
4102000	4107360	you know. And Bohemian Grove is similar to Skull and Bones. It's like a secret society that nobody
4107360	4113680	knows what the heck they actually do, besides do weird dances. Yeah. And they, you know, it's
4113680	4119280	worship of an owl and a bunch of other stuff. And we know there's like the Mike Cleland, you know,
4119280	4125520	owl UFO stuff. And, oh, right. And up Solica has talked about that. And so,
4126480	4130000	yeah, I don't know. I haven't read enough into it. I just kind of know some of that cursory stuff.
4130720	4135520	So let's move on to point eight. I heard part eight. I don't know what dang thing about this.
4135520	4140000	It, I hadn't read this. I asked you if it came out and you told me yes. So what can you tell me
4140000	4144240	about this? Because I think it involves a little bit of sort of like the black magic you were talking
4144240	4150400	about with the with Iraq and so forth. Yeah. And maybe, yeah, I mean, without having
4151760	4156880	predetermined any of this and kind of writing it out, you know, as kind of in real time,
4157680	4161120	I guess to go to, you know, to end up at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove
4161920	4168480	and whatever they were doing there. And then to close off with like Stargate and the Tomb of
4168480	4175200	Gilgamesh. I mean, that was a thing that kept coming up. You know, everyone's been on the hunt
4175200	4184320	for Colt Hart's UFO too big to move. Right. It's come up a few times that, you know, the U.S.
4184320	4191520	Embassy in Iraq looks like it could be, you know, where this all is. And then I think at some
4191520	4198400	points, you know, a couple of people brought up the fact that the Tomb of Gilgamesh was reported
4198720	4206720	found like barely over a week before we invaded. And there's some other stuff too I found recently
4206720	4212080	within like that timeframe, I forget, but some weird stuff, some business dealings and stuff. And so
4214080	4221280	that's why I was wondering like when specifically JSOC was set up. Oh, interesting. Like all part
4221280	4226480	of this story of JSOC is answering to Cheney. Cheney's the one who was basically running the
4226480	4232480	Bush administration. Just like Bush Senior was running the Reagan administration, you know,
4232480	4240160	the Bush family through the Western Company. Global Defense, which is under dresser industries,
4240880	4247920	is one of the contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Holly Burton famously was the big one. So it's
4247920	4254480	like these guys probably behind 9-11, let it happen. There's a famous, you know, they had a meeting
4254480	4260480	that morning with the Saudis. It's the Carlisle Group in the Saudis. And then 9-11 happens.
4261040	4266480	Didn't Rumsfeld, I think a couple of days before 9-11, talk about like two or three trillion
4266480	4272320	dollars missing at the Pentagon as well? The day before. Okay, day before. Interesting.
4272320	4279200	Yeah, September 10. I just read that again. So you were talking about the Iraqi embassy,
4279200	4285120	I think even before Ross coming out and talking about the massive UFO buried under some sort of
4285120	4289840	construction, there were stories that the Iraqi embassy was built over a UFO, as well as other
4289840	4294080	stories in the kind of somewhat local area of the Middle East. There's some rich Munda stories,
4294080	4300160	like a 1958 crash retrieval occurring in Kabul, Afghanistan and so forth. So there's actually
4300160	4306000	a lot of really rich lore in the Middle East that I don't even think has been begun to be explored
4306000	4316160	until your piece. So yeah, I think part of this, so yeah, I've been kind of hearing that stuff.
4317120	4324320	And then, you know, I haven't read either of the Skinwalker books, but I caught up on an older
4325520	4331840	apocaster a couple of years ago with George Knapp that kind of re-aired with, I think, on UAP
4331840	4337680	studies, you know, this was a couple months ago. But he basically walks through the timeline of,
4337680	4347040	you know, Bigelow and NIDS in the late 90s, early 2000s. And then you've got Bass, which is basically
4347040	4354560	where a lot of, you know, UFO reports and stuff are being sent in the 2000s. And then whatever
4354560	4363040	happens there to, you know, ASAP and then ATIP. And what really stuck out to me was that he said that
4364240	4370000	when Hunt for the Skinwalker came out, you know, that was Knapp and Kelleher,
4370960	4375920	then it got passed around to people at the DIA in the Middle East, like Likatsky.
4376960	4377520	Interesting.
4377520	4383680	And so you're like, oh, okay, Likatsky was working for the DIA in the Middle East in 2007.
4384560	4388560	Maybe the year after we build this embassy and they're looking for stuff, you know,
4388560	4393200	like it would kind of make sense if that was all tied together. And also 2007,
4394000	4400640	I don't know what he was doing, but Kirk Patrick was part of some joint CIA DIA operation.
4401680	4411120	And I know it came out recently. I know Carl Nell was on like the first team
4411840	4418400	that went over there in 2003. And I think Elizondo was also on another like first team that went
4418400	4424640	over there. So I don't know. Yeah. It's just a lot of stuff around this. And then it gets weirder.
4426160	4431360	So scrolling through the article, I see you bring up a picture of the alleged Holloman Air Force
4431360	4436800	base tape, which was actually just talked about by James Fox in his interview with Jesse Michaels.
4436880	4442400	James Fox stated in one of his documentaries, he interviewed a guy that had seen this tape.
4442400	4446480	What is the context here of including this clip or including this image?
4447520	4451840	I don't remember. What did Cameron say? Something about,
4453840	4457760	because it's Cameron who's been tying Cheney into a lot of this stuff.
4459360	4461600	But Carter knew what Cheney knew eventually.
4462400	4462720	Right.
4464080	4465280	I don't remember exactly.
4466160	4469680	Okay. Yeah. You're talking about Grant Cameron and Jimmy Carter. Here we mentioned the story of
4470320	4474880	Carter crying. I still don't know. We still don't know if that's a legitimate story or not.
4475760	4481280	She hand talking about Carter's election. Let's see if possibly under here. Okay. Jimmy Carter.
4482160	4490320	Oh, oh, cool. Okay. Here. Okay. So Grant Cameron commented on this. So apparently this 15 minute
4490320	4495440	film was shown to Jimmy Carter. Grant Cameron states this. Grant Cameron is a fantastic researcher.
4496000	4501280	And this film, without reading this clip just from my head, apparently shows a saucer with
4501280	4506880	three landing gear touching down, a hatch opening up from a smooth surface that doesn't show any
4506880	4512720	sort of view holes, port holes, signs of propulsion, all the classic observables of a craft. A sort of
4512720	4518880	runway comes down. Three beans come out. They look like tall humanoid individuals wearing headgear
4518960	4526000	that a film altars said looked like Egyptian headdresses. And so James Fox talked about this
4526880	4531040	video quite a bit in his recent interview with Jesse Michaels and said he interviewed
4531040	4534480	I can't remember the exact person. Yeah. I'm almost done with that interview.
4535040	4537680	It's really dang good so far. Yeah. That's great.
4538400	4546240	Interesting. So according to Grant Cameron, Carter had seen this footage. And in the footage,
4546240	4552160	I think like the beans basically start interacting with humans, which is pretty
4552160	4558800	darn interesting. It reminds me a lot of 1957. You know astronaut Gordon Cooper, he stated while
4558800	4564880	he was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, he had a survey team film kind of remote parts of the
4564880	4571680	base. And one of his survey teams caught a UAP landing that is same kind of saucer shaped craft,
4571680	4576320	I think 40 feet in diameter. And when his film crew got close, the saucer within 20 yards of the
4576320	4581120	craft it took off and he had seen this film and others had and then apparently it was confiscated.
4581120	4587520	So that sounds very similar. I can't remember the exact date of this. 57. Okay. 57. Yeah. Then the
4588240	4592640	Edwards might have been 54. So these I think were within three years, these two supposed films.
4593520	4595440	Oh, right. Yeah. Because 50.
4598160	4606880	I'm trying to, yeah, put all this together. Because wasn't. Oh, right. Okay. Because this,
4606880	4614000	I think what I read and I mean, I don't, a lot of it wasn't verified, but I think there was talk that
4615440	4621120	what I knew of Kingman, I know you did your video, you know, which I think probably the best
4621120	4630080	one I saw, I mean, it was great too. You know, Kingman, the story that I understand is that
4631120	4640960	there were like eight craft and there were dog fight and one crashes into the side of a cliff
4640960	4647120	and it's totally demolished. One crashes into the ground. A guy's brought out to study it in
4647120	4653840	engineer. And I think there's a dead body, one or two, I forget. That was the Stancil crash.
4654640	4660000	Okay. And then, and then a third one is gifted. And that maybe these were the,
4660960	4667360	like Eisenhower was at all three of the sites or something like that, that it was like
4668960	4675280	the Kingman gifting was at one base, maybe at the Dugway site, which I know Greer's talked about
4675280	4682720	a lot near Kingman. And then another one was Edwards and then there was a third one somewhere else.
4683360	4690240	So that like one of these was the sites where possibly Eisenhower made his agreement and 53 or
4690240	4695360	maybe it was this before, I'm not really sure. Because the Kingman kind of the multiple craft
4695360	4701840	theory came from Harry Drew. And just like you said, over I think a week in March, seven days
4701840	4707120	in March, his documentary, there were three separate crashes, one crash, one forced landing
4707120	4714000	with which Arthur Stancil saw and one kind of gifted craft. Okay. Which is very interesting.
4714000	4718800	And that documentary seven days in March or seven days in May, I can't remember, is almost
4718800	4726800	impossible to track down. I've never heard of it. It's a, Harry Drew packaged it with a like a book,
4727360	4732160	a limited release DVD. So I know a couple of like researchers who have been trying to track
4732160	4737520	down that dang tape, but nobody has found it. It seemed like that 53 to 57 region had a
4738320	4743040	time span had a lot of really interesting contacts because there's the Edwards Air Force Base
4743040	4748800	touchdown, according to Gordon Cooper. There's the, there's the Holloman Air Force Base landing
4748800	4753600	film according to Grant Cameron now that Jimmy Carter saw. And there's the Kingman crash all in
4753600	4758960	the span of four years. Yeah. Right. Well, and that's coming after 52, you know, which was
4759600	4765600	a pretty bonkers year as well. And 53 to start, we saw the Robertson panel as well. And 52 we see
4765600	4771760	UFOs over Washington DC. Right. Right. Yeah. You know, I've, I haven't read all of the
4774720	4778720	the Schellenberger document. You know, I've posted it a couple of times, but
4779440	4786080	every 10 pages, I'm just like, I cannot, like this is crazy. Like, it's, you know,
4786080	4793680	that's the, that's the timeline debrief for Congress, right? I, yeah, it's 177 pages or maybe
4793680	4799280	that's just the first document or something. But yeah, it's just like, Oh, another craft,
4799280	4804080	more dead bodies, whatever, you know, it's just like so routine for these guys, you know, whether
4804160	4807760	you hit the nail on the head, it's exactly 177 pages.
4808320	4815600	Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's like every time I started to get through it, it just spun me out so bad.
4815600	4820080	You know, it was like, Oh, this is just completely normal. It became normal, you know,
4820080	4825360	immediately after Roswell, basically, that like they kept finding, you know, these crashes and
4825360	4829440	these dead beings and stuff, and they didn't care. You know, they were like, Oh, okay, just like,
4829440	4834720	box them up, you know, we'll take care of them. Like, have you gotten a chance to read Leonard
4834720	4839680	Stringfield's crash retrievals parts one through seven? I know I haven't read any of his stuff yet.
4839680	4846880	No, I'll, I'll actually send you the PDF of that. That is in is so consequential to my research. And
4846880	4851760	I think you follow the ufology in general, especially talking about crash retrievals and
4851760	4858560	the subject of bodies. It is so fascinating. And Michael Schrat, this was in 2016, I think,
4858560	4863120	was able to access the archives of Leonard Stringfield, who is now deceased in Cincinnati,
4863120	4868400	and made a whole nother series of kind of crash retrieval cases that Leonard never published,
4869040	4874880	including including discussion of the Edwards film as well. So there's a quite a tangible
4874880	4880800	research line for the supposed films of craft touching down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually,
4880800	4887040	I got to hang out with Michael Schrat last Sunday. Oh, did you? Oh, yeah, yeah, you told me. So I
4887120	4893680	joined the Hollywood Disclosure Alliance early August to try and reach out to producers, you know,
4893680	4899120	for documentary stuff. And so even that was like, Oh, I'm like emailing with Steve Bassett and,
4899120	4906400	you know, Dan Harari. And, and then they had an event last Sunday, and it was Thomas Jane,
4908400	4915440	Ron James from Mufon, and then Michael Schrat. And then we went to a dinner afterwards and
4915440	4920800	the location kept getting moved, just some weird confusion, I guess. So it came down to like,
4921520	4926000	eight of us or something. And I'm at this dinner table with like, Michael Schrat to my left,
4926720	4931200	Steve Bassett to my right, you know, Dan Harari right in front of me. And I'm just like, Oh,
4931200	4937280	okay, I guess this is my world now, you know. Now, did you get to talk with Schrat extensively
4937280	4941520	about crash retrievals? Because he's just so well versed on on that subject. What'd you guys get
4941520	4946400	to talk about? Yeah, I got to film in on magenta, because he didn't know any of the stuff yet.
4947200	4951840	Right. He called me the next day, we talked for like 20, 30 minutes about it. And then he,
4951840	4955040	we were, he wanted to meet up today, but I was like, Well, I'm doing this thing.
4955040	4960480	And so we take president over Schrat, I'm honored, man. That's like an hour from me,
4960480	4966240	it's fine. Yeah, he's pretty close. I know he's been looking for with his incredible drawings of
4966240	4972400	craft and sightings used like by almost every researcher. He's been trying to find a more
4972400	4978240	concrete description of the magenta craft to be able to draw because I think so the only real
4978240	4983360	description we have is from Grush, like a lenticular shape. Yeah, right, right. Two saucers
4983360	4989360	pressed against each other. That's slightly damaged, but whole integrity intact. Right, right.
4991360	4994080	I mean, that's kind of what I walked in through and I was showing him,
4994800	4997360	I don't know if he'd seen the Daily Mail article on, on that,
4999520	5003440	it's the only big one that I've seen, but yeah, I was just showing him, I'm like,
5003440	5007840	I don't know, this is all I've seen. And so, you know, I know that and whatever Grush said, you
5007840	5012960	know, and so that's what he was trying to, you know, get down to is just like, what are the
5012960	5018480	exact dimensions? How exactly, you know, did it crash? I'm like, I don't know, I'll send you some
5018480	5024480	stuff. Still have all the way dating back to the magenta case, have you been able to kind of
5025280	5030800	tie in any of the mega defense conglomerates like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Boeing, Northrop Grumman
5030800	5037440	into, into your work as well alongside the EG and G Carlisle SAIC and some of the oil conglomerates?
5038960	5045440	No, I mean, that stuff has been even, yeah, too confusing for me just to understand
5045440	5050400	like the parallels, you know, between the defense contractors. I mean, I know,
5051600	5059280	you know, Lockheed works directly with the Air Force. I just, I don't really understand
5061120	5066400	like this, where the CIA, basically, I don't know where the CIA and the Air Force split,
5067280	5071920	because it seems like that's part of this story. Yeah, it seems like, yeah, especially
5071920	5076400	where's the difference, because there's a lot of joint teams in JSOC that can operate under
5076400	5082800	CIA's directive or any sort of directive. And the Air Force has quite a few teams, 24th STS,
5082800	5089440	the old classic blue berets and so forth. The Air Force is very interesting, but so is the,
5089440	5094800	also the naval involvement as well as outlined by Chris Sharp. Yeah, right. In his recent article,
5094800	5100480	I think he, after his third edit, because I think there was some trouble with Dean, Dean Johnson.
5101040	5106000	Yeah, but I try to extend an apology to him because I had talked about
5107280	5111760	the original edit that Sunday before any of that drama came out. So I felt bad if I had
5111760	5117760	implicated him in anything bad like the threats he said. Yeah, I'm confused though. I wasn't
5117760	5122960	paying enough attention. What happened with all that? So September 20th is when the article
5122960	5128560	is released. September 22nd, I did a live and I remember I had read the article when it first
5129040	5134800	the second it came out. And I was gobsmacked to see mention of the National Underwater Reconnaissance
5134800	5144640	Office of CIA, Office of Science and Technology, NRO, NGA, Lockheed Martin, and Woodsville Ocean
5144640	5151120	ographic Institute. And come the 22nd, that had been edited out. So thankful to the Wayback
5151120	5155440	Machine, I was able to talk about the original version of that article. And then that week on
5155440	5160080	Twitter, Dean, Dean Johnson, I guess, called Chris Sharp out or something. And Chris Sharp
5160080	5165920	stated that he had received threats due to the original article. So he re-edited everything
5165920	5171360	out there and basically expanded on the fact or not fact, but the allegations that Woods Hole,
5171360	5177360	in accordance to kind of NRO, the underwater reconnaissance office, will retrieve craft
5177360	5181760	due to their very unique submersibles and then pass them on to the Office of Naval Research
5181760	5187920	for testing alongside defense contractors. Yeah, okay. Just another thing.
5189920	5194640	Yeah, because I feel like for so long, the Navy's been overlooked in terms of
5195840	5202160	but going back to the nexus of like Air Force Regulation 200-2 and JANAP-146C in which the
5202160	5208000	USAF kind of restricted UFO reporting methods and like incurred a $10,000 fine if commercial
5208000	5213680	pilots reported UFOs, the Navy did the same thing with OPMAV 3820. So the Navy was right there with
5213680	5218320	the Air Force back in the heyday of kind of restricting UFO reporting. Gotcha. Okay.
5220080	5225120	This is so bonkers. And then of course, there's corporations that tie into every single piece
5225120	5231920	of this, whether that's the Lockheed-Norton, SAIC, EG&G. Right, right. And I think, I mean,
5231920	5236640	that's the way we've all are in our little chat. Yeah, kind of been joking about it too, is just
5236720	5244160	like, well, it makes sense. I mean, all of this makes sense now. I think half jokingly to sort of
5244160	5253280	talk about a lot of this is being almost biblical in a general sense. There are these revelations
5253280	5259680	coming out and there's so much at play all at the same time. You know what I mean? It's like we've
5259680	5268000	got the craziest political upheaval we've ever had. We've got climate crisis. We just watched
5268000	5276240	the crazy flooding yesterday on the East Coast. Just so much income inequality and disparity
5276240	5282400	and all these things and all these reckonings happening on a cultural level and socioeconomic
5282400	5291840	level while all of this stuff is happening as well. And it's almost like, yeah, the whole,
5291840	5297200	it's like this entire system has been built up. And this is like when it all kind of comes down.
5299120	5304320	This is the house of cards, basically. And so even to talk strictly about all the different
5304320	5310960	contractors, it's like this whole thing is so unwieldy. And like the way Dana Solika talked
5310960	5317600	about the Fight Club, it's like that thing's making more sense now. Just all these people
5317600	5325920	have it. Yeah, the picture of corporations involved in contractors as well as USG specific
5325920	5330880	three-letter agencies and USG military branches that are involved is starting to become a bit
5330880	5338400	clear. And it's been very fascinating to follow these revelations and see how a JSOC, OGA,
5339040	5346800	ONR, NRO, NRO, NGA and so forth has implicated. It's so interesting. I wonder if the magenta craft,
5346800	5351040	if it where it's being housed now, if there's still sort of efforts being done on it or it's
5351040	5358160	just kind of catalogued away and like an Indiana Jones relic warehouse. Yeah, I mean,
5358160	5362080	what was Birchhead's joke? Like every time you name them, the whole truck shows up.
5363040	5370160	It takes stuff away. Yeah, yeah. I mean, my best guess is that initially,
5371520	5378880	it might have been taken to Oak Ridge, you know, because, you know, Vannevar Bush gets the memo
5380160	5385680	from, I think from FDR, from Marshall. I forget. There's some of the three of them are talking,
5385680	5390720	basically, you know, so he gets to setting up Oak Ridge, you know, and this is also following
5392640	5398960	the Cape Girardeau incident. So, you know, if they had everything, at that time at least, you know,
5398960	5402800	had everything in one place because there was no Edwards Air Force base or anything,
5404240	5409200	who knows now or any of this stuff is, you know. And I found it interesting in later cases,
5409200	5414400	especially in the 60s and the 70s, how often mention is made of kind of rotating warehouses of
5414400	5420160	where craft are stored. One perfect example is Kecksburg that is supposedly taken to Lockburn
5420160	5424800	Air Force Base in Ohio first and then shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. There's also
5424800	5430720	the testimony of an anonymous witness RB in Stringfield's files that talked about guarding a craft
5430720	5435280	about three hours outside of a base in South Carolina and that every two weeks, three weeks,
5435280	5443920	it would be rotated through. Oh, really? And also, in a project I'm covering now, there's stories of
5444080	5449680	reverse engineering testing team that's rotated through every six months for program security.
5449680	5453840	So, possibly not only are materials transferred around and shipped around, but personnel are
5453840	5459760	too. But is that kind of an old method or is that still ongoing? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know
5459760	5466320	about sight of things at all. I haven't heard any of that stuff. But it's just, what do you have
5466320	5471360	next for your research? Where do you plan on going next? I don't know. I have to like,
5472240	5477680	yeah, I have to figure out personal stuff. I fit so down this rabbit hole.
5480160	5483520	Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I've been looking into like the death ray stuff, which is
5483520	5489440	really interesting. And, you know, Marconi playing around with that stuff and Tesla playing around
5489440	5498160	with that stuff. And, you know, John Trump, you know, Donald Trump's uncle, who is basically given all
5498160	5512000	of Tesla's files after he dies. And at the same time, he was in like the x-ray business. And then
5512000	5519600	I think when it was announced we were going to World War II, he got into radar. And so it's funny
5519600	5527280	that he's the one who's given Tesla's documents, you know, Tesla was also like, if radar came from
5527280	5533520	the death ray, and that's what John Trump specifically was also working on, was radar stuff.
5533520	5539280	But, you know, even the way like, if you watch like Simon Hollis, you know, that's kind of where I
5539280	5546080	sort of started locking onto that, you know, that like we understood more about radar early on
5546800	5553280	than we let anybody know that it was all derived from an F-ray. And it basically was like an EMP
5554240	5560320	early on. So, and then it makes sense that it's, you know, partly responsible for a lot of these
5560320	5564640	crashes early on as well, you know. Yeah, there's early stories, especially with Roswell, that's
5564640	5572960	some sort of radar interference, kind of a mess with a craft's inner circuitry or however the craft
5572960	5579200	are powered. That's an awesome rabbit hole. Oh, yeah, that's fun. Yeah. I mean, I was watching the,
5580160	5585280	I don't know if you saw the Falcon crew guys who got the part of the arts parts
5586720	5591440	a couple months ago, and we're testing it. Oh, they've done material, they've been
5591440	5596400	doing material analysis. A little bit, yeah, and they were super public right away, you know,
5596400	5600560	they were live streaming at all. But, yeah, they got a little bit of it anonymously,
5601520	5607040	and, or by a source who wanted to stay anonymous. And, yeah, I just happened to catch it that day,
5607040	5611440	and they were looking at it, and it matches up with so much other stuff that a lot of us have heard
5611440	5618960	about, like the terrorist waveguide stuff, and how it basically acts as a superconductor, and,
5619920	5627120	and it looks, it would make sense, you know, if it's like 3D printed material, and there's like a
5627120	5634640	lattice honeycomb structure inside of it. So it makes sense if like the power gets transferred
5634960	5642560	up, it's like this really, like beautiful way, basically, that, you know, the whole thing gets
5642560	5650160	powered. And, yeah, it's pretty wild. I mean, I had, I had a sighting once that kind of lines up
5650160	5656160	with some of that stuff. Oh, would you see? I've had a few, but this was the closest one,
5656160	5664240	this was back in January, not far from my house. Yeah, I saw two, I'm assuming it was two,
5665200	5670560	they were in the clouds, and so I didn't see any like structure, but I basically just saw the
5670560	5678960	underside of like the, I'm guessing, like electromagnetic waves that were powering these
5678960	5684320	things, you know, and one was like this beautiful amber, and one was this beautiful violet, and
5685200	5691280	they were really close together, moving really slow, like, wow, do they have any like change in
5691280	5697840	direction? Could you see kind of a shape of a craft? I mean, they were saucer shaped,
5699440	5705360	but I didn't see any like hard craft surfaces or anything. They were like, yeah, just inside the
5705360	5711360	clouds, and I was like coming in from hanging out in my backyard and looked up, and right there,
5711360	5716160	things moved really slow, and I kind of waved and said hi, and they took off into the clouds
5716160	5720400	real slow, and I was like, okay. Interesting, now you said you could see kind of like an
5720400	5724800	electromagnetic discharge, what you, you could see kind of a visible wave pattern?
5726240	5732000	Yeah, there's a, I can't mean to find these and save them, there's two images I've seen, one is of a,
5733200	5740240	one went around a month or two ago, it's like a coin, I forget from where, but one side is like
5740240	5746720	of a craft, and then the other side is like a straight up reptilian, like smiling or something,
5747440	5754800	and there's another image from, like this famous historical image from Italy, from Rome or something,
5755360	5761840	that's very similar to where the craft, it's like these grooves on the bottom, and so it kind of like,
5761840	5770000	if you can imagine, like let's say, eight or ten grooves on the bottom, and it's kind of like each
5770000	5776400	one had its own like energy field. Interesting. So all I could see was the energy basically.
5776400	5783040	Kind of like of a saucer shape? Yeah, yeah, it was, yeah it was beautiful, yeah, it was wild.
5783040	5790000	That sounds fascinating. And it was, I mean, yeah, and it was, I was having like a particularly bad
5790000	5795120	night too, so it was kind of funny when you talk about the psychic connection, whatever all of that
5795120	5801680	means, you know, it was kind of like, yeah, I was having a rough one, and it just, it was like,
5801680	5808800	came out from under my carport, and it looked up, and they were just right there. Wow. Okay, thanks.
5809520	5815200	That is incredible. And I went back in and kept playing video games, yeah. Whatever, geez.
5815600	5822080	Voler, I'll let you, I'll let you go now. I got a 20 minutes until a hard stop, and I usually do a
5822080	5829760	tiny bit of a Q&A right before, but real fast, where can you run through part eight real quick?
5829760	5837600	Yes, please, yes. Okay, so apparently the story of a Stargate was going around in the 1920s
5838480	5843200	in Iraq, and a lot of the world's rich and elite were kind of obsessed with it.
5844320	5850080	Apparently, some of this isn't in there, apparently who Saddam Hussein found it in like the late 80s.
5850880	5857680	And so when we went to war in 90, that's a big part of what they were looking for,
5859360	5863840	Bush and Cheney. And I guess Cheney was like obsessed with the idea of a Stargate, you know,
5863840	5867040	and this like ultimate power and time and space and all this weird stuff.
5869200	5873200	Some people have reached out to me to say that like when we invaded in 2003,
5874240	5877600	that was specifically, they were looking for that. And I think that's what they found,
5878160	5883680	purportedly, what they found in this tomb of Gilgamesh is this Stargate. And there was a story
5883760	5894080	too of, I think Russian officers in like 91 saw the US shoot down a UFO in Iraq.
5895040	5895680	Interesting.
5897600	5905440	Yeah, so basically, yeah, it looks like that's possible. Stargate, UFO, whatever. I mean,
5905440	5909440	there's this J-Rod story in the Stargate and all of that. So, yeah.
5909440	5913840	In part nine, we might see a further investigation into the Stargate because I
5913840	5918080	find that absolutely fascinating. I have a very amateur level of knowledge here.
5918080	5926000	So, it's just keeps getting crazier. So, we got part nine to look forward to and
5926000	5929600	the documentary you're starting to work on for Magenta.
5929600	5934400	That's new documentary. Yeah, definitely some stuff about the death ray x-ray or death ray
5934400	5937760	radar stuff. I don't know. I haven't really thought it out too much.
5938480	5943920	So, where, so Reddit and Medium under voller records, where else could we find you?
5945440	5952960	I started it about a year ago, losing my mind after Grush. And then my Reddit posts were getting too
5952960	5958240	long. Oh, wait, I think I lost, yeah. Where'd you go?
5962640	5970400	Oh, sorry. What was I looking for? Oh, my Medium is Escape Velocity.
5970400	5977600	Escape Velocity. Okay, I have that in your Reddit posts in the video description.
5978080	5983680	Okay, awesome. Cool. I know that we kind of glossed over some of the details, but I highly
5983680	5988000	recommend reading every single part one through eight and clicking through the links because
5988000	5993920	in every single piece you've made, you have linked a tremendous amount of third party research and
5993920	5999360	other avenues to go down. And that is my favorite thing about this research that nothing is just a
5999360	6004160	you saying, okay, here's an executive summary. It's the entire body of research with clickable
6004160	6007760	links. And people still complain. So whatever. I mean, I don't care anymore.
6008480	6014480	You can never have 100. It's too many links. Hey, man, you know how many times I get people
6014480	6019680	calling me out of my videos for not pronouncing words, right? There will always be some level
6019680	6024400	of dissatisfaction. As long as you're putting together a cohesive thesis with supporting links
6024400	6029440	and an argument, I think you're doing a fantastic job. And these eight pieces I have learned so
6029440	6036800	much from. I think they're amazing. Cool. Yeah, lost my mind. Trying to get it back now.
6036800	6040720	All right, Voler, well, I will catch up with you privately, my man. And thank you so much for
6040720	6045680	coming on the show. Once I wrap this up at here, six PM my time, I'll shoot you a text and we'll
6045680	6052160	talk a little bit more. Thank you so much, brother. I appreciate it. All right. Bye, brother.
6052720	6058560	Yeah. Okay, guys, we're going to do 15 minutes of Q&A while I get Voler signed off here.
6059600	6063760	Everybody, please thank Voler for coming on the show. He's done a tremendous eight parts.
6064560	6069600	It's incredibly difficult to try and talk about all eight parts he's done because this is like a
6070320	6076080	massive body of research. So check out all eight parts. We're going to do 15 minutes until I got
6076080	6081280	to get off of Q&A. Because you know, I love to do that at the end. If you guys will give me one
6081280	6085680	second, I'm just going to run to the restroom, put some questions up and I will get to them in
6085680	6097200	like two seconds. All right, give me less than a minute. I'll be right back.
6111280	6112740	You
6141360	6153120	know, okay, guys, I am back. So let's let's start going through some questions.
6156000	6160400	One of my boys texted me said there was a little bit of quarrel going on in the chat. So if somebody
6160400	6165760	wants to enlighten me as to what was going on, let me know. Also, I just find the connection
6165760	6170800	of the entire Bush family to the legacy programs fascinating. I think this is an avenue that
6170880	6176720	should continue to be explored and I cannot wait. So I did miss a couple super chats,
6176720	6181680	too close, two cents, fat rodents, Ort Wiener. Thank you guys so much for donating. I so
6181680	6185520	appreciated it. I didn't get a chance to look at the chat during the conversation with Volare
6185520	6190560	Records, but I appreciate him coming on the show so very much. I think those eight pieces are
6190560	6195440	fantastic. And I hope he makes a documentary on Magenta. Let's start with Big Dog. Yeah,
6195440	6201440	the Bush research is fantastic all the way from the Magenta crash to OSS to big oil companies
6201440	6208800	and so forth. So we'll start going through these. Zach, what's up, brother? Where do you draw your
6208800	6213280	line? Is open landing and contact in a military base too much fixed point out? It's like the same
6213920	6223120	time and location as Sakura. I'm not sure, especially in terms of the Holloman and Edwards
6223120	6228880	Air Force Base landing. It seems like a almost one off occurrence as far as we know of Fox,
6228880	6233520	not Fitz. Okay, okay, I see. Fox points out it's like the same time and location as Sakura.
6233520	6238160	I still find it strange, especially the Holloman Air Force Base landing is almost an isolated
6238160	6241920	incident in which beans outright present themselves. However, there is one more story
6241920	6246240	of that I'm going to cover up in my next video at an Air Force Base of some beans who almost
6246240	6250320	willingly walk out of their craft and give it up. It's a story in one of Leonard Stringfield's
6250320	6255120	crash retrievals. It's very interesting, so I can't wait to cover that. So let's see.
6258080	6262000	Okay, you guys must be chatting about some in here. Let me know what you guys have been
6262000	6266080	talking about. Have I watched the X Files mythology episode? Highly recommend no, but I've
6266080	6271280	wanted to get into X Files, especially a couple cool people in my discord have been talking about
6271280	6276800	X Files and one of the creators I think Frost and how X Files may have had a little bit of
6276800	6282320	interesting inside tidbits in terms of this, in terms of their research. So
6283520	6290240	what's your opinion on Daniel Salter and the Accio? I do not know what the Accio is. So if ACIO,
6290240	6294000	I don't know if it's an acronym, so please fill me in so I can do some research.
6297440	6300480	Have you had a chance to look at Larry Reed from Lockheed? You should try and get an interview
6300480	6305680	with him. No, I have not. I still want to get, I'm still trying to get in, not contact, but a
6305680	6312800	little more information on Dr. Jim Ryder as well. But Larry Reed is up there. Did I accidentally say
6312800	6319600	cover up? I don't know. Did I? I don't think I did. I need to fix the spectacles. If I said
6319600	6324720	cover up, let me know how I said it. The Iraq Gilgameshian Bible and buried UAP rabbit hole,
6324720	6329680	it's wild. I need to read the whole part eight because the tomb of Gilgameshian Iraq and the
6329680	6335040	possible embassy being built in that region because of some sort of UAP technology or tech as well
6335040	6339920	as Dick Cheney is really interesting. I'm such a novice here. That's why I was so excited when
6339920	6344800	Voler texted me today and said that he had this part eight out on Stargate. It's wonderful.
6346800	6351120	Mentioned of X-Files and Twin Peaks, I think the same Frost, the showwriter worked on both.
6352800	6356880	Let's see. Let's see. Everybody's loving Stargate is...
6359120	6362560	Okay, let's see. Sounds like you and Voler need to get together with some of the connections you
6362560	6366400	both talked about. I'm going to make him a chart of his names and dates and overlaps.
6369200	6373120	You made him something. I'd love to see that. That's awesome. I would love to work with Voler,
6373920	6383440	Kermit, Senior Trader, 3942, a lot of guys on a joint project because there are some amazing
6383440	6388480	researchers out there that the bulk majority of their work has been put out on Reddit. If I can
6388480	6392240	help it, I'll use the platform to let some of them come on and talk about their research like
6392240	6399280	Voler. I think it's fantastic. Fringe is better than X-Files. I've never seen Fringe, so maybe I
6399280	6408000	will have to watch that. Let's keep going through. Leave the Bill Herman abduction. Maybe some new
6408000	6414640	interesting abduction stuff coming up soon, guys. I've heard Stargate is a very good show,
6414640	6420560	the original. I recently made an executive decision. I was between that and Battlestar Galactica,
6420560	6424960	the early 2000s show. I decided to go with Battlestar, so maybe I'll do Stargate next.
6427920	6434160	The first season of X-Files was based on RealPerson's FBI case, John Sousa. That sounds somewhat
6434160	6440400	familiar, but my recollection is failing me, so I need to do some extra research there.
6441360	6449440	Okay. I would love to team up with Jesse Michaels and Danny Jones. We'll see about Jesse. We never
6449440	6454800	got to get together when he was here in Colorado. Just got to be a little bit too big, but he and
6454800	6460560	I chat often, so there should be some more time soon coming up that we can link up.
6462320	6466400	Sorry. Cheney must have met with analysts at CIA's WinPack many times leading up to the
6466400	6472240	invasion of Iraq, probably. Yeah, absolutely. I still find it so interesting that,
6473040	6477520	according to Voller's research, Cheney might have had a vested interest in some exotic technologies
6477520	6485120	that Iraq. Okay, let's see. After reading through Voller's posts and watching your vids,
6485120	6489520	is there any area you recommend someone to look into, something that is often overlooked?
6490960	6494400	Patterns with bodies associated with crash retrievals. I think a lot of the time with
6494400	6498720	crash retrievals, I talk about this a lot, people are afraid to go into the territory of bodies
6498720	6504560	because it's so contentious, and a lot of people look at it with such ridicule, but bodies are
6504560	6510480	one of the most fascinating and unexplored aspects of retrieval operations. Santiago,
6510480	6516080	have I ever played Halo? Dude, is that even a question? Halo reaches my ultimate gaming experience
6516080	6523440	I've ever had. I know Halo 3 is probably considered the greatest Halo game, but I will continue to
6524000	6531040	preach that Halo reach was the pinnacle of gaming. I loved that game. Okay, so the ACIO
6531040	6538080	Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization. No, I need to look into that more. Is the
6538080	6543360	Looking Glass located at S4? Yes, Mr. Mozilla. According to Dan Burish and a couple other
6543360	6549280	alleged sources, Project Looking Glass is located at area S4. According to the design specs by
6549280	6555680	Dan Burish, S4 has five levels, with the lowest level housing J-Rod level, the level above being
6555680	6562000	like a crew quarter for testing the level above housing Project Looking Glass. Still, I get asked
6562000	6565600	this all the time when I look into Dan Burish. Probably at some point, but I got a lot of other
6565600	6573680	stuff first. The Looking Glass is pretty interesting, and there is a whole PDF. It's like a book.
6573680	6578160	It's called Project Aquarius that focuses on Dan Burish's claims in Looking Glass. I highly
6578160	6582080	recommend looking at that. I'll post a link to it in the Discord.
6583200	6590080	I do remember Reach. Reach is fantastic. The final mission, Survive, is that can bring a tear
6590800	6595520	to any man's eyes. Did you know the CIA trains psychic spies to build mental protective barriers
6595520	6600400	around CIA facilities to prevent remote viewers from spying? Yes, I did. I've heard about that.
6600400	6605040	I don't know specific instances, specifics, or specific individuals, but I have heard of that.
6606000	6612320	The CIA and private companies research into psionics and psychic powers remote viewing is
6612320	6620640	something that fascinates me greatly. Could reported classified alien religious documents
6620640	6624800	be declared constitutional violation of freedom to practice religion by the Supreme Court forcing
6624800	6632240	disclosure? That is assuming that classified alien religious documents exist, which I think
6633040	6643040	that is alleged by Bob Lazar and the Reddit biologist. I think the two people who have
6643040	6648080	commented on that, if such documents exist, I think that would bring a lot of really interesting
6649680	6657680	questions on theology. Can you please never say scintillating again? I'm sorry, I just did.
6657760	6660800	But I'll try to. The word scintillating is great.
6662880	6666080	So something or someone says, I wouldn't say remote viewing is real. I remain
6666080	6671200	unconvinced. Okay, so you're talking about remote viewing. Yeah, I would also like to
6671200	6678080	see demonstrations of remote viewing. Very interested in it. Have I come across a lab
6678080	6685760	laboratory in Italy in my research? I have never, but that might be something I'll
6685760	6689920	pull over to a voler to look into in conjunction with the magenta case.
6693760	6698560	Scintillating. Okay, guys, at this point, you know that there are many words that I pronounce
6698560	6704080	absolutely horribly in the videos I go through and try to make sure I pronounce everything
6704080	6710480	correctly, but I will miss stuff. I just can't speak too well. That being said, the new video
6710480	6715840	should be here tomorrow or Tuesday. I'm thinking Tuesday to put some extra time into it.
6716720	6724640	I really think you guys are going to enjoy this video. It is another primary investigation with
6724640	6730240	a ton of research put into it. The video I would liken it most to is the Off-World Technologies
6730240	6737840	Division. There are some pretty surprising research avenues here, so keep an eye out for that.
6738640	6744240	I'm not going to spoil the name or the subject of it. After that, we have another really cool
6744240	6750240	crash retrieval. Fire away the questions, guys. We've got a couple more minutes. If anybody's
6750240	6756400	got any more questions, maybe I'll give another hint to the next video. I guess I kind of
6757440	6763520	disclosed something. It involves mention of various Air Force bases such as Nellis. That's
6763520	6769280	going to be a cool one. I appreciate that, Hayden Pierce, even if I'm mispronouncing stuff. This one
6769280	6776880	involves the possibility of reverse engineering in various Air Force bases, most notably Nellis.
6776880	6783840	There was a reason that I talked about the U2 with Nellis and testing there at Area 51.
6785360	6788880	Area 51 is just northwest of Nellis at the Nevada Test and Training Range.
6789040	6797520	I think in the comments, some of you guys are talking about not trusting Elizondo.
6800880	6805200	What have been some of the arguments for and against Elizondo in the chat?
6806080	6810160	If you guys are talking about Elizondo, I'd like to see some of these.
6810960	6818000	A little bit of discourse in the chat. You guys, let me know what's going on.
6818640	6824960	I appreciate that, big dog. There's so many topics in this space that aren't covered
6826080	6833600	necessarily to a wide extent. As we see with Volor Records, research that even analyzing
6833600	6840320	just a small case or an individual in their connection to UAP requires a tremendous amount
6840320	6851520	of research and diving into. You haven't checked the Scott Castle USO story. Guy says he has footage
6851520	6857520	somewhere of a USO. I'd be very interested to see that. I'd like to put some more time into USO
6857520	6864640	research, especially with the implication of Woods Hole, Neuro, O&R, and so forth. If there's any USO
6864640	6870800	videos, I would like to see those. The only USO related video I've seen was a Reddit post of
6870800	6875760	just some anomalous lights under some water. This photo occurred at night. I'm sure you guys
6876320	6884080	know what I'm talking about and have seen that. Guy says he has footage somewhere, a tail has
6884720	6890960	as old as time. With many cases, there will be alleged footage. That's why stuff like
6890960	6895920	Holloman and the Edwards Air Force Base is a bit frustrating because even though somebody like
6895920	6899920	Gordon Cooper and accomplished Mercury astronaut will say that footage exists,
6899920	6905520	there's still no way to get our hands on such footage. Throughout Crash Retrieval's Parts 1-7
6905520	6911200	from Leonard Stringfield, there is also much discussion of a supposed alien autopsy as well,
6911200	6915440	some sort of lost footage. I think there was a NASA astronaut recently who mentioned seeing
6915440	6924480	some sort of NHI video as well. Were you talking about the story where a guy from the retrieval
6924480	6928800	team asked a bunch of languages but the beans are just catatonic and walk right off the craft?
6928800	6932720	Can I get the Stringfield PDF too? Yes, I will post that. No, those are two different things.
6932720	6937840	The bunch of languages is the infographics whistleblower who talks about the head doctor who
6937920	6943840	is fluent in Russian, English, Chinese, and other languages. He references some cases where the
6943840	6951200	beans found are almost children that can be led by pointing. This is a small story. It's a small
6951200	6956800	excerpt in Leonard Stringfield. I think it's Part 9 of Crash Retrieval's Part 6. Sorry,
6956800	6961440	there's a bunch of parts in it. I only make mention of this because it is of important
6961440	6966560	contextual relevance to my case. I will tell you exactly where it is, Zach. Are you in the discord?
6968640	6974400	I'll post it there. Could there be a connection between UFO and the gremlins at the RAF?
6974400	6982400	The RAF Royal Air Force claims would cause trouble for them. Quite possibly. I'm not too familiar
6982400	6986160	with the claims of RAF and the gremlins. That might be something I have to look into a little bit.
6988560	6994240	Space Geek says, thank you for all your hard work. You have the most well-researched videos.
6994240	6997760	I truly believe once the YouTube algorithm finds you, you'll have millions of subs very soon.
6997840	7003840	Thank you, ma'am. That'd be cool. I don't even know how to deal with 10,000 subs, let alone a
7003840	7008560	million. Boy, that would be a dream. I'm going to post the Discord link one more time, guys,
7008560	7015200	because Zach wants to hop in. Hop in the Discord if you want to chat about UAP during the day,
7016000	7020720	talk about anything. There's some really sharp researchers in there, too. Really sharp guys.
7021600	7028240	Zach just posted, Anthony, good show. Interesting links about EGNG, Carlisle,
7028240	7031120	and various players. Thank you. I very much appreciate that. You have a story of Eric
7031120	7036160	Tabor, especially with EGNG. Area 51 is really interesting, especially how it ties into the
7036160	7040640	donation craft theory. That patch, there was a lot of controversy around that, because I think
7040640	7045440	Eric Tabor didn't think much about it initially, so he tried to pawn it off on eBay. That's why
7045440	7049760	there was a bit of steam when Ross Colthart posted the patch initially in his presentation,
7049760	7056160	and then it images surfaced of it up on eBay. That got a little hairy at one point,
7056160	7060480	but that's a great story. Of course, Eric Tabor is a second, if not a third-hand whistleblower,
7060480	7064960	but still him talking to Arrow is still of consequence, and I still find that
7064960	7066800	extremely interesting and worth paying attention to.
7069840	7073520	You're talking about Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl talking about Gremlins. No, that's interesting,
7073520	7078640	but as a child, I loved Roald Dahl's work, especially the BIG. I'd like to check that out.
7080480	7087120	Okay, what are you guys? We'll answer a handful more, guys, and then we shall sign off, so I can
7087120	7091680	also post some of those documents and so forth in the Discord. If there's anything I forget to post,
7091680	7098480	please just let me know. My mind's going a couple miles or miles a minute when we talk, so there's
7098480	7102720	some stuff I might forget, but I know I need to post for you, Zach, that specific excerpt of
7102720	7108240	Crash Retrieval's Part 1 through 7. I'll just post the full thing, and I'd love to talk a little
7108240	7112880	bit about Michael Schratz diving into Leonard Stringfield's work, so that's another one I'd
7112880	7118800	like to look into. Guys, if there are no more questions, okay, okay, upcoming vids you are
7118800	7123440	working on, any tees? Yes, I just did tease the new video that should come out Monday or Tuesday.
7124080	7129200	I will say one word, or I guess two words, and that is reverse engineering,
7130640	7135920	and I guess another couple of words, I will say Air Force Base, and this video has been
7136000	7141360	a blast to work on just as much as the Off-World Technologies Division. That's the sort of video
7141360	7147440	I would like in it, too. Big dog, thank you so much. Thank you. I really appreciate the support,
7147440	7155040	as always, man. And if you guys are arguing about Elizondo, Yuri Geller, how did he get
7155040	7158560	brought up, and other people do, I'd love to see it in the Discord or bring up the arguments. I'd
7158560	7163040	love to see what you guys are talking about, but with that, my friends, we shall sign off for the
7163040	7168160	day, and I really appreciate everybody joining. Thank you so much. The video should be out Monday
7168160	7174960	or Tuesday, and we will have a next stream on Sunday and possibly a couple other things coming
7174960	7179520	out in between then. But thank you all so much for joining, and I will catch everybody on the next show.
