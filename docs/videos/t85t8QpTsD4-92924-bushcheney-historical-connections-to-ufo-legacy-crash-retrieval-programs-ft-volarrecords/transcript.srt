1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,200
Okay, let's see.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,200
I think we should be live at this time.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,240
If anybody can hear us in the comments, let us know.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm here with Voler Records.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,680
Let's see, this should update the number of viewers

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,520
in just one second.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
Sometimes it's a little laggy.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,640
Okay, cool.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,320
It looks like we're starting off with 40 people.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,400
If anybody can hear me in the chat, please let me know.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,000
And then we will cut to the chase

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,640
because we have quite a bit to talk about today,

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,760
quite a bit of really interesting stuff.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,120
Okay, cool.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,960
All right, what's up?

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,040
See, Britt and I see you.

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,640
So guys, I'm here with Voler Records.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,040
A lot of you probably have heard of some of his work.

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440
I wanted to kind of link up and speak to him today.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,280
Let me just pull up what he's been working on a little bit

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,880
so we can kind of get a little bit of baseline

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,480
for what we're gonna talk about.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,720
So Voler Records recently, I would say,

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,600
when did you start this, about August?

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,560
About three weeks ago.

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,360
Okay, he has put out an eight-part series now

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,160
at this point that covers the relationship

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,160
between UAP Legacy Programs, the Bush family,

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,520
the 1933 Magenta Case, Dick Cheney, companies like EG&G

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,520
and the Carlisle Group, including a part eight

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,880
that just recently came out.

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,240
I haven't got a chance to read that yet,

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,120
so we'll talk about that today.

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,000
But the sort of the amount of research here

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,680
and the quality of the posting is just so fantastic.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,800
I know he's worked closely with a lot of other people

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,520
I've talked to, such as C. Britton in the chat,

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,040
363942, Max Parr, Kermit, all fantastic researchers.

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,320
So Voler, if you'd like to introduce yourself a little bit

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,920
and kind of tell us a little bit

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,240
how you got into investigating the phenomenon

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,200
and then how you said that all the talk of Dick Cheney

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,360
being at the top of the UFO pyramid inspired you.

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,960
I'd like to hear how you got into this subject

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,840
in this specific research project.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
Sure, like a lot of folks been into this stuff

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,240
since I was a kid, kind of terrified and fascinated

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,200
at the same time, was buying books.

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,320
I just turned 44, so I was of an age where it was like

50
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,560
right when, unsolved mysteries and sightings

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
and all the shows were coming out

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,880
and growing up an 80s kid.

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,920
Yeah, and I was buying books.

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,600
I had a little section on my bookshelf

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,480
of like UFO cases and stuff.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,400
And yeah, I never really lost interest

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
but it kind of came and went in terms of intensity

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,320
and yeah, we were talking right before we went live.

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I think in 2004, there was the famous case

60
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,360
of the Mexican pilots, I'm pretty sure it was Mexico.

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,120
And it's like the seven lights, craft, whatever

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
that they see and that was a pretty big deal.

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,880
And I think that was about the time that YouTube hit.

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,040
And so that went pretty viral, you know,

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,320
until the point that, you know, it was like Mexico

66
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,560
and Venezuela and a few other central

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
and South American countries.

68
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,040
And I know it was Sweden and I don't remember who else

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
but, you know, there was an attempt

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,920
to building this kind of international coalition

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,200
for transparency, you know, and of course,

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,600
the United States didn't wanna have anything to do with it.

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,360
And then, yeah, I mean, cut to 2017,

74
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,840
we all know what happened there, you know,

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
it was such a huge thing.

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,360
And then in 2020, you know, with really nothing to do,

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,440
you know, I was pretty involved with the protests and stuff.

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,240
And I think once a lot of that started quieting down

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,000
in the fall, I was just all in on this

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
because everything else was so messed up, you know,

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,120
it was just kind of like, okay,

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,560
like we're in a pretty bad spot, you know,

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
kind of all around.

84
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,240
And so yeah, just a lot of my free time was spent,

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,360
you know, watching stuff and listening to podcasts

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,280
and just kind of soaking things in and, you know,

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,600
we'll talk more about this,

88
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,760
but I think a lot of this has been about, you know,

89
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,360
normalizing a lot of this stuff.

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
Yeah, I know we were talking about it a little bit

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
and it's something that's featured heavily in your research,

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
is kind of calling back to statements Grush has made,

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,480
whether on his news nation appearance,

94
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,200
whether at his congressional hearings.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,720
And it sounds like Grush was like a massive influence

96
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,760
for a lot of your work.

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,960
And would you say that, especially in July of 2023

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,320
with Grush on news nation, the Senate hearings,

99
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,760
that kind of kickstarted you to research this in depth

100
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,800
into a subject?

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Yeah, I mean, I would say I was already there,

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,960
but definitely, I mean, that changed everything.

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Right.

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,840
That was such a huge deal.

105
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
I mean, Elizondo was a big enough deal.

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,320
But yeah, Grush, I mean, Grush spun me out.

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,760
You know, I remember I had a whole,

108
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,080
the whole next day I was just like,

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
in a weird haze almost, you know?

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,080
And it was funny because I kept thinking

111
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,680
things were gonna change right away, you know?

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,000
And we're still here.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,080
I mean, the lots happened, but you know, I think

114
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,880
so much of this has been about learning, you know,

115
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,040
kind of the way Matthew Pines has been talking about it.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,400
You know, this sort of word of mouth desensitization

117
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,200
and normalization and, you know, you can still kind of

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,520
go about your day and, you know, I think

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,960
because of the fluid nature of media now

120
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,040
and the way that we consume it,

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,920
you can very easily see some crazy UFO video

122
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,040
and then keep scrolling Twitter or whatever,

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
you know what I mean?

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,560
And you're just like, oh, okay, that's pretty nuts.

125
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,480
And then kind of move on, you know, to a degree.

126
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,160
But yeah, I mean, I think, I'm not really sure.

127
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
I'll say it was around, we were talking about this,

128
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,000
but, you know, before we started recording,

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
but I think it was around December

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,160
that Ross Coltart did a talk at a library in Victoria

131
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,520
in Australia.

132
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,680
And at the very end, he mentioned EG and G.

133
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,760
And I think it was JT4 and some other stuff.

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,760
And I think that was when I got past the cool video part

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
and started actually digging in to like,

136
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,120
oh, we're talking about, you know, companies

137
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
and organizations and agencies and this stuff, you know,

138
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
this is a lot bigger.

139
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,600
And I know there were people there before me, you know,

140
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,760
it's funny now, going back, looking through Reddit

141
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
and stuff, doing research where it's like,

142
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,200
oh, people were there even before Grush, you know,

143
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,680
they started digging in.

144
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,480
But for me, it was kind of moving past some of the shock,

145
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,640
I guess, you know, and getting to a point where it's like,

146
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
yeah, this is more than real.

147
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,160
It's like, there's just, the history of this is a lot bigger

148
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,240
than I think any of us had realized.

149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,600
Yeah, and that's something I really appreciate about

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,440
kind of your work in the eight parts we're gonna talk about.

151
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,560
Videos to me at least mean very little.

152
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,200
And I'm super vocal about this almost every video I do.

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,760
It's kind of the hard nose paper trail,

154
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,040
the official documents, the alleged documents,

155
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,600
the alleged involvement of certain contractors

156
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,800
and three little organizations that that's kind of

157
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
the research avenues I like to go down to actually kind of

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,720
move a conversation forward instead of just going in circles

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,800
about some lights in the sky footage or and so forth.

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,360
Right, because there's not that much to do

161
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
with that necessarily.

162
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
No, no, yeah.

163
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,160
But that's why we're all here, you know, to a degree.

164
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,080
So I'd love to just kind of dive into part one here

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,600
because part one of your eight part series really starts

166
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,680
to focus on the introduction of the Bush family

167
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,400
and their involvement with the creation of the OSS,

168
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,640
Alan Dolis and then 1933 Magenta, Italy,

169
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,040
Crash Retrieval case, something I've covered a lot before.

170
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,440
So I'd love to just kind of hear some summarization

171
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,400
and points of that post.

172
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,480
If you'd like to share your screen as well

173
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,160
to kind of go through research, we can do that.

174
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,880
Otherwise I can show some stuff because I think

175
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,120
especially the base point here, part one is,

176
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
is super consequential, especially with the implication

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,960
of the Brown brothers and Harriman and so forth

178
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,240
that I learned from your work.

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Oh, really?

180
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,160
Yeah.

181
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,160
So yeah, I having been so active on Reddit a few months ago,

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,400
I think it was 363942 started a little private chat

183
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
with a few of us.

184
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,680
And that's when we started kind of bouncing things off

185
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,920
of each other, you know, because really it was just them

186
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
and Harry's white timeline.

187
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Right.

188
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,760
Like I'm a, you know, I think in terms of narrative

189
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,960
and a literal, you know, editing timeline,

190
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,240
like let's start looking at it like that

191
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,840
and it'll make it easier to piece this stuff together.

192
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,640
So yeah, eventually, I mean, it really was just the last

193
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
two or three months maybe that, you know, a lot of that,

194
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,040
it was like, I was seeing Bush's name pop up

195
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
in a lot of the earlier research.

196
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,800
And then, you know, we kind of would all keep digging

197
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,440
in different time periods and yeah,

198
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,680
just started coming together more, you know,

199
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,480
and the Brown brothers, Harriman stuff.

200
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,040
I think we were kind of on that.

201
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,200
And then I, it was really just a few weeks ago, you know,

202
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,440
I've been watching a lot of the She-Han interviews

203
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,360
and he had mentioned Bush a few times

204
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,800
and there's the story of, you know, him or Carter,

205
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
you know, bringing him in to brief him

206
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
and Bush saying, no, and then I,

207
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,320
one of the last interviews he did, got two weeks ago,

208
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,760
maybe it was right before I started posting this.

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,320
He pretty much spent his entire hour

210
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,200
only talking about Bush.

211
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Yeah, that was the October 18th,

212
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,920
year right to know interview, I believe so.

213
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,960
It's one of his most recent ones.

214
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,320
Yeah, maybe it was with,

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,840
was that the one with Jeffrey Mishlove?

216
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah.

217
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,200
And that's where he really starts to dive into Bush.

218
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,400
I think H.W. Bush as well was mentioned by Lou Elizondo

219
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
as kind of having some sort of knowledge

220
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,800
of UFO craft retrieval programs

221
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
or just an estimate of the UAP situation.

222
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah, I don't know if I saw that, yeah.

223
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
But yeah, just kind of,

224
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,440
this whole thing is so crazy, you know,

225
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,520
I think a lot of these, I mean, these posts,

226
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,720
I was just banging them out basically late at night.

227
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
You know, I just take up for, you know,

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,680
six or seven hours and just like,

229
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
I feel so weird walking around with this stuff, you know,

230
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,280
I have to get it out of my head.

231
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,680
So how did you, sorry, I'll keep on Reddit here

232
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
instead of Medium, because I'm not signed in here.

233
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,640
How did you start to connect H.W. Bush

234
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,200
and the Bush family to Magenta?

235
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,920
Because Magenta, of course, is a case

236
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,400
for anybody that doesn't know,

237
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,640
is a case that occurred in 1933 in Magenta, Italy.

238
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,480
It was a crash lenticular object

239
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,240
that was taken in by Mussolini.

240
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,080
Mussolini had theorized that this was

241
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,560
an ally of experimental aircraft, American or British,

242
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,080
but some of his engineers, such as the RB,

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,240
why can I remember right now?

244
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,240
The RB in a number thought this was sort of an NHI craft

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,600
or early thoughts of this.

246
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,160
And then eventually information was channeled

247
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,040
to the Americans from Pope Pius, the I can't remember.

248
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
And eventually in the Pius the 12th,

249
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,880
and in the closing years and days of World War II,

250
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,200
somehow the Americans were able

251
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,360
to get their hands on this craft.

252
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,420
So how the heck did you connect that

253
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,460
with Alan Dolos and the Bush family?

254
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,200
So really I have to give most of the credit

255
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,640
to 36, 39 here and Harry before that,

256
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,740
before he kind of dropped his mic on Reddit.

257
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,880
Yeah, I think Dolos had been coming up a lot

258
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,920
and I wasn't even that familiar with him.

259
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,600
And so much of this has been a true history lesson

260
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,800
outside of the topic, in terms of the inner workings

261
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,460
of the CIA and all that stuff.

262
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,000
And it's funny, I've been going back and kind of building,

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
I've made a couple of supercuts last few days

264
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,440
of times that Grush and other people will discuss this case.

265
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,920
And he explicitly says, like the OSS retrieved this,

266
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,800
when I was in the CIA, et cetera.

267
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,840
So it was kind of put in our hands right away,

268
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,640
but I think some of us had gotten there

269
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,480
in a roundabout way in seeing Dolos pop up,

270
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,680
and then learning about OSS,

271
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
and then it was like the more it kept going back,

272
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,640
and even towards the end of this kind of thread series,

273
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,840
it was just like, this is so crazy.

274
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,960
This is all one story.

275
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,880
This is all like a small group of people.

276
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,800
If you go back to Brown Brothers, Hairyman,

277
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,080
it was Herbert Walker who was Prescott Bush's father-in-law.

278
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,960
And Prescott Bush was H.W. Bush's father, correct?

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,080
Right, so then it's Prescott Bush

280
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,800
is running that company with Avril Hairyman.

281
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,560
Later, Hairyman goes on to become,

282
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,640
I think he's Eisenhower's secretary of state.

283
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,480
He's calling a lot of shots in the government post-47.

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,040
So it's the two of them at this agency.

285
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,680
Eventually, Alan Dolos has lead counsel there.

286
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,160
Some of these folks knew each other from Yale.

287
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,280
There's a huge skull and bones connection.

288
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Yeah, I realized again towards the end of this,

289
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,600
the skull and bones was a primary recruiting source

290
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,120
for the CIA at the behest of Prescott Bush.

291
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,360
Well, you really, I mean, we started to see

292
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,400
how a lot of his power was very, very centralized

293
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,960
within a small group of people.

294
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,360
And that George H.W. Bush was eventually at the head of it.

295
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,400
He's kind of brought him to the fold in the 40s

296
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
after he graduated from Yale.

297
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,920
Yeah, and H.W. Bush was as kind of a higher up in the CIA.

298
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
He was kept under wraps for a while, right?

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,400
Up until his almost presidential run.

300
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,360
Right, and it came out in 88

301
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,600
when he was running for presidency.

302
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
There was a paper called The Nation,

303
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
I think it's a UK paper,

304
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,440
and the journalist had found out that Bush had lied

305
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,600
about how long he'd been in the CIA.

306
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,640
He said he'd been brought in in 76 as the director,

307
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,200
but really he was traced back to like 61.

308
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,480
And apparently he was briefed about JFK

309
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,600
within the week after the assassination.

310
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,520
And then people have been commenting the last week or so.

311
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,720
There's been some closer connections there possibly

312
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,120
about him being in Dallas and taking a flight around

313
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,280
and making some anonymous phone call and all this stuff.

314
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,600
And yeah.

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,320
So one of the things that really kind of part one

316
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,160
of your research relies on is a book that She-Han

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,000
was kind of advertising on his shelf during an interview.

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,840
This book is called Nazi Hydra in America,

319
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,160
Suppressed History of a Giant.

320
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,880
And this was featured on his shelves.

321
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,160
And throughout this book,

322
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,600
this talks about how Prescott Bush helped

323
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,760
like the Nazis ascension in kind of a,

324
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,760
alongside the Brown Brothers and Harriman and so forth.

325
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,640
So can you talk a little bit more about that,

326
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,480
how Prescott Bush and the Bush family was actually kind of

327
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,720
entwined with the OSS as well as Hitler's ascension

328
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,080
and kind of the fascist party rise in the U.S.

329
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
there in the 30s.

330
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,320
Yeah.

331
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I mean, those guys helped fund the business plot in 33,

332
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,680
which was kind of parallel with Hitler at the time,

333
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
you know, and that they were trying to basically

334
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,640
overthrow FDR after he was inaugurated

335
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,040
and install, you know, a fascist dictator.

336
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,280
And that failed, you know, sort of Hitler's plan.

337
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,120
And eventually, yeah,

338
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,120
they all forget some of the details

339
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
cause a lot of worries, Rushdale.

340
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,680
But, you know, those guys were at the core of banking

341
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,720
and Wall Street and the steel industry

342
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,560
and shipping and a bunch of stuff.

343
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,680
And yeah, they were actively funding the Nazis.

344
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,880
And set up a separate bank basically,

345
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
specifically for that, you know,

346
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
and they got in trouble for that later.

347
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,520
But it was all the same people, you know,

348
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,760
it was Prescott Bush.

349
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,880
I think, I don't think Harryman was involved with that.

350
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,440
You know, I think he was actually pretty upset

351
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,160
because he was Jewish.

352
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
Or he was Jewish or his wife was Jewish,

353
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,440
but he went to Germany and came back

354
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,040
and forced his brother to close their office in Hamburg

355
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,480
once he saw what was happening,

356
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,680
I think in like 35 or 36.

357
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,080
So one of the players you also talk about

358
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
on the American side of things,

359
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,880
of course we talked a little bit about Prescott Bush,

360
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
George H. W. Bush, we'll talk more about Alan Dolis,

361
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
but is James Angleton,

362
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,800
who later on in his life became an OSS agent.

363
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,480
This was the kind of intelligence organization

364
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,200
that preceded the CIA.

365
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,280
Angleton was a child in 33 living in Magenta, Italy.

366
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,400
Was he not?

367
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,560
He was in Milan.

368
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,400
He was like three miles away.

369
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,920
He was in Milan, three miles away.

370
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,080
Yeah, so possible they were first hand witnesses

371
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,040
or they definitely heard about it.

372
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,520
And he was the youngest agent

373
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,600
under Bill Donovan at the time, right?

374
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,040
Yeah, he was like 16 or 17, yeah.

375
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,320
So of course, now with these early days,

376
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,840
have you been able to make any connections

377
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,240
with specifically Dick Cheney

378
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,160
and kind of the Bush legacy of the Magenta crash?

379
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,960
Only in that Prescott was there.

380
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,040
Like Prescott for sure knew about it.

381
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,040
And you got Dolis, Donovan, Angleton.

382
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
Most of these people were Yale.

383
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,400
It's like the whole Bush family was Yale, Skoll and Bones.

384
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,440
Angleton was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones.

385
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,160
Donovan was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones.

386
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,800
Dolis, I forget.

387
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,800
But they were all part of the same like white elite,

388
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,920
university dudes who basically formed the OSS.

389
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Right, because of 36, 39, 42,

390
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,560
some of the crux of his research in the Magenta case

391
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,040
is analyzing Alan Dolis and the good old boys

392
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,000
and how they arranged the intelligence

393
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,880
to kind of get the UFO out of,

394
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,400
whether it was Germany or Italy at the time,

395
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,800
but post World War II,

396
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,840
specifically revolving around Alan Dolis.

397
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,080
That's how most of his research applies.

398
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
And I find it really interesting,

399
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,080
you were able to bring Skoll and Bones into this.

400
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
If any of you don't know Skoll and Bones,

401
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,600
especially for our European audience,

402
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,360
Skoll and Bones is a US based secret society.

403
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
Think of in the early 2000s

404
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
when Alex Jones infiltrated the Bilderberg group.

405
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,560
Skoll and Bones is a Yale society.

406
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
Who knows what they get up to?

407
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,040
I think there's rumors that they burn like an owl effigy

408
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,080
or just do very strange stuff.

409
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,720
But throughout, it's so strange,

410
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,800
but you were able to connect,

411
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,320
let me find some of these members.

412
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,080
You were able to connect guys like Alan Dolis, George HW Bush,

413
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,680
Prescott Bush and so forth to this secret society.

414
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,000
How does, would you say Skoll and Bones relates

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to kind of OSS, CIA and legacy possible programs?

416
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,200
I mean, I guess, you know, because it just so happened

417
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,000
that it was those guys that were coming out of,

418
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
you know, not just that university, you know,

419
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,160
but that specific, you know, secret society fraternity,

420
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,160
whatever you want to call it.

421
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,480
And then those were the guys that formed the OSS, you know,

422
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,240
and then in 47, those were the guys

423
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,000
that formed the CIA post Roswell.

424
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,160
So it was kind of like they've been in on this

425
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,080
the entire time.

426
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
Especially cause there's one individual here

427
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'd like you to expand on a little more,

428
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,160
Richard Bissell, who declined to be in the Skoll and Bones,

429
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,200
but by this I can assume he attended Yale.

430
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Tell us what, so tell us what he said to Harold Malmgren,

431
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,600
former president, daughter, father, presidential advisor

432
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,160
and very, very senior member, Richard Malm,

433
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,960
Harold Malmgren, sorry.

434
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
Right, right, right, yeah.

435
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,520
I mean, that was really new to me, you know,

436
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,160
I know that went pretty viral, you know,

437
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,120
at least in this community when he tweeted that out,

438
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,120
but yeah, I think he said in 63 that Bissell had told him,

439
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,880
you know, about it an exotic, you know,

440
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,960
reverse engineering program,

441
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,020
and the era of, yeah, NHI, you know, tech basically.

442
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,560
And then it turned out that, yeah,

443
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,320
Bissell was at Yale at the same time.

444
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,720
He declined to be part of Skoll and Bones,

445
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,700
but his brother was in it.

446
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,260
So there's a good chance he knew those guys back then as well.

447
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,620
You know, he was brought in, I don't know his history,

448
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,660
I haven't read that into it, not much into it yet,

449
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,660
but you know, in 47, he's asked by Avril Harriman,

450
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,700
a brown brother's Harriman to basically run the Marshall Plan

451
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,920
and go over to Europe, talk them into borrowing money

452
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,640
from the US, you know, for reconstruction.

453
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,840
And so you start to see that Bissell, you know,

454
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,760
becomes this new figure at the heart of this, you know,

455
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,400
and in 50, at some point,

456
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,960
he's working for the CIA after that.

457
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,960
And I think it's in 54 that he decides that Area 51

458
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,200
is gonna be a good spot to test out a new aircraft.

459
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,480
Right, Bissell, yes, that's a great point.

460
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,600
Bissell proposed the site of Area 51.

461
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,440
Right, right.

462
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
And Bissell told Malmgren, I think the exact quote

463
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,080
was of like an other world technologies.

464
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,420
That's right, yeah.

465
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,680
I know that phrase very well,

466
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
because of course I have covered an alleged

467
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,080
off-world technologies division,

468
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,680
and when Malmgren made those outstanding statements,

469
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,600
I can't tell you how many people kind of sent me screenshots

470
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,440
of that tweet.

471
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,280
Oh, really?

472
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,520
So he set up the space for Area 51.

473
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,560
Right.

474
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
And then...

475
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,400
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

476
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,120
Quick with Bissell, I just, I don't remember.

477
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,760
I know I think I had included it, you know,

478
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,760
it's kind of at the tail end of things, but so 54,

479
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,760
he decides on Area 51, 55 versus, I think it was 55.

480
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,520
He brings the plans for the U-2 to the Air Force

481
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,240
and they turn them down.

482
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,240
And so he has CIA pilots test flying the U-2 in Area 51.

483
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
Right.

484
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,440
And what's interesting about that is Area 51

485
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,440
and the U-2 program out of Area 51 was also sponsored by,

486
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,120
that remote detachment was sponsored by

487
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,960
Edwards Air Force Base, California,

488
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,040
who was also laterally connected

489
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,880
to reverse engineering programs.

490
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Right, okay.

491
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,960
That's also a very interesting point.

492
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,040
So you have in your timeline here,

493
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,400
kind of starting in the 1930s with Brown Brothers

494
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
and Harriman and Bush families

495
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,520
and how the Bush family helped Hitler rise to power,

496
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,480
but was also instrumental in forming the OSS.

497
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,240
You mentioned the Roswell crash in 1947.

498
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,520
Come 1948, you mentioned a company called Dresser Industries.

499
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,000
How do they play into this?

500
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,640
Oh man, yeah, this was huge.

501
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,680
This kind of, yeah, this tied everything together later on.

502
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,000
So Dresser Industries was a company that was bought

503
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,960
by Prescott Bush and Alan Dulles, I think.

504
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,960
And they used that company to start Zapata Oil

505
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,760
in I think 51 and they put George H.W. in charge of that.

506
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,880
And so this is where a lot of the things where it's like,

507
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,640
oh, okay, the same people that have access

508
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,640
to this exotic tech are the same people who started Big Oil.

509
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
So they're running things in all directions at the same time.

510
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
And they're also, of course, directly involved with the CIA.

511
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,440
So you can start to see that

512
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,240
these things are all part of the same story.

513
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,280
That's something that, although he's quite controversial,

514
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,760
that Steven Greer talks about quite a bit.

515
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,520
I know in his redacted witness list,

516
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,040
he has witnesses from companies that I'm highly suspecting

517
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,480
or something like a general electric

518
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,880
who talk about knowledge of suppressed kind of

519
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,120
exotic technologies to kind of reinforce the oil industry

520
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,880
and continue dependence on oil and so forth.

521
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,120
Oh, interesting, okay.

522
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,760
As well as other companies like AT&T and Bell Labs.

523
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,120
So Greer talks a lot about kind of tight energy

524
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,480
and oil tycoons having knowledge of exotic technologies,

525
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
but continuing the suppression.

526
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,240
Oh, interesting.

527
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,480
Okay, that makes sense.

528
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,160
Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, this is when, you know,

529
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,400
things start getting really crazy

530
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,520
because you start to realize like, cool,

531
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,960
this is just kind of one empire

532
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
that's been running the whole show.

533
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,600
You know, and as far as dresser industries in the 90s

534
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,600
when Cheney, oh, there's so many players now I'm gonna forget.

535
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,800
That's all right, there's so many people.

536
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,960
Cheney was secretary,

537
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,640
Cheney was secretary of defense for Bush.

538
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,600
Is that right?

539
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,440
Yes.

540
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,800
But George HW and at the same time,

541
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,600
they're making oil deals and arms deals and stuff.

542
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,080
And he's doing stuff with Halliburton.

543
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,200
And then after George, after Bush loses,

544
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,920
I think Cheney goes in a private industry for a little bit.

545
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,920
And in 98, Halliburton merges with dresser industries.

546
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,000
So that's when you start to see

547
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,400
these like legacy families come together, you know,

548
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,200
the Bush empire that had been going on for decades.

549
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,160
And then this new Cheney empire that started,

550
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't know, I guess in the 80s, you know,

551
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,720
maybe there's more business dealings before that,

552
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,760
but you start, you know, and you see in 98,

553
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
like that's when they joined forces, you know,

554
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,800
before the election.

555
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,120
That's fascinating, research trails like that

556
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
just kind of uncovered.

557
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm astonished you were able to pick on

558
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,240
some of these intricacies like dresser industries

559
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,080
and so forth.

560
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Oh, it was so crazy.

561
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,280
Because every, I mean, you know, again,

562
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,920
I was just staying up late and doing this

563
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,640
and it was really hard to keep track of it all,

564
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,080
especially because I was writing it out, you know,

565
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,880
kind of as I found it, you know,

566
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,000
because it was still astonishing.

567
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,800
And I was worried if I didn't get it all down

568
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,800
and post it, I'd forget it because I was just,

569
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,760
there was so much information involved, you know?

570
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,600
So that's why I actually started this,

571
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,600
the night that that tweet about Cheney came out

572
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,960
because I was like, oh, okay,

573
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,280
this is, there's something really, really here then,

574
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,080
you know, I have to really get this out of my head

575
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,240
and get it all down.

576
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,120
And yeah, just the more I kept digging,

577
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,880
it was just like, oh, like every time,

578
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,280
every single time I was writing these out, you know,

579
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,120
I was just like, this is all completely insane.

580
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,440
Now, I find it so interesting.

581
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,200
What was the interview in which the interviewer states

582
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
that Grush said that Cheney sat on top of the pyramid?

583
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,520
What, who was the interviewer?

584
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,160
I can't remember the show.

585
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,560
I was Walter Kern.

586
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,800
Walter Kern is, I think, the editor,

587
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,960
editor-in-chief of the County Highway,

588
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,200
which is the new print-only newspaper

589
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,360
that came out last summer.

590
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,080
And I think the second issue did that interview with Grush

591
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,440
that I didn't know about till a few months ago.

592
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,360
And then, of course, there's the 2000, 2001 radio show

593
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,120
in which a researcher, Grant Cameron,

594
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,080
who from a presidential UFO called in,

595
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,640
asking Cheney about programs.

596
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
And Cheney said, if I was briefed into one,

597
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
it'd probably be classified and I couldn't talk about it.

598
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,920
Right, right.

599
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,200
And I might have forgotten to include it,

600
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,720
but four years later in 2005,

601
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,840
there's a story I found from the Herald Tribune

602
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,520
where Cameron was trying,

603
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,960
I think he was trying to fly,

604
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,920
he flew into California to attend

605
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,600
some UFO convention or something.

606
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,080
And I think he wanted to try and track down Cheney

607
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,880
and custom stopped him

608
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
and they made him go back to Canada.

609
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
Oh, I haven't read that.

610
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,760
Yeah, I might have forgotten to include that in the post,

611
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,560
but, so yeah, I mean, Cameron knows a lot of stuff,

612
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,080
you know, obviously.

613
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,280
Have you had a chance to dive into his file base?

614
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,560
I used a lot of his internal research files

615
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,280
for my Kecksburg research.

616
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,600
No, I feel like I'm actually behind on a lot of people

617
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,320
as far as the stuff goes,

618
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,800
because it's like, I think we're all just consuming

619
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,280
different things at different times.

620
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,880
And then, you know, that's when we start

621
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,520
to kind of boltron it all together.

622
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,360
Right.

623
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,800
You know, because that's, it's just so big.

624
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,640
You know, and I think that's the point, you know.

625
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,200
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself there.

626
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,240
Cameron has, I think he posted a picture of his office

627
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,920
before he uploaded all of his documents

628
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,880
and he had an entire office filled with just papers.

629
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,400
I don't scratch the surface of going through his files

630
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,880
on Eric Walker, Lyndon B. Johnson, and kind of James Webb.

631
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,800
So there is so much more to go.

632
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I don't even know how any of those people are involved.

633
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
Yeah, so.

634
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,680
So let's, now let's hop on to part three.

635
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,920
A part three and four, I think we're actually combined,

636
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,760
right?

637
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,080
Yeah, I posted them.

638
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,360
I think I was having trouble.

639
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,960
I was posting too soon or something.

640
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,440
Oh, OK.

641
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,040
Yeah, because I got, I saw one post was wrong.

642
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,040
And I just, I wrote them both pretty quickly.

643
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,800
So in part, what was the crux of kind of part four

644
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
that you were talking about?

645
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,520
You mentioned a lot more on the players of Alan Dolis,

646
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,040
his death, you were talking a little bit about Gerald Ford,

647
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,640
which was pretty interesting, the church committee,

648
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,240
and so forth, a little bit about Cheney and Rumsfeld.

649
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
So what was a little bit of the crux of your research

650
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
here in this part?

651
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,880
Yeah, I think that was, yeah, again, I mean,

652
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,680
these were almost extreme of consciousness.

653
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't really remember exactly.

654
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,400
Right.

655
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,120
I think it was tracing back how everybody knew each other

656
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,920
and knew probably about this subject.

657
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,080
And so you've got Nixon, who was Eisenhower's VP.

658
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,520
And Eisenhower, very famous stories about him

659
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,960
and possible meetings and agreements and stuff.

660
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
So of course, Nixon probably knew something too.

661
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,360
And then I'm forgetting exactly, but I think it was in the 60s

662
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:05,920
that Ford and Cheney and Rumsfeld first all met working.

663
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,040
Whatever they were doing, I forget exactly now.

664
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,440
But those guys go back to the mid-60s, basically.

665
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,920
And then in the 70s, when Ford takes office

666
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,400
after Nixon resigns, he installs Bush, a CIA director,

667
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,720
following the church committee.

668
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,760
Basically, the CIA was in shambles post-Watergate.

669
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
They were completely busted.

670
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,440
And so they installed Bush.

671
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,840
After Bush has had this very strange career of having,

672
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,720
I think he was in office for two years as a senator or something.

673
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,960
And then he's the envoy to China or ambassador to China

674
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,200
and some other cushy role and just kind of strange stuff there.

675
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:01,120
And then so at that time, you've got Ford, Bush, Rumsfeld

676
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,800
was, I forget, like Secretary of State maybe for Ford.

677
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,840
And then Cheney becomes White House Chief of Staff,

678
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,040
if I remember correctly.

679
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,360
Right?

680
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,880
Yeah, I think Cheney was a staffer for Rumsfeld.

681
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,360
And so then when Rumsfeld is given the role of Secretary,

682
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,800
if I think it's Secretary of State,

683
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,240
he recommends that Cheney take over as Chief of Staff.

684
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,880
So you've got all of these guys.

685
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
You've got Bush, Ford, Cheney, Rumsfeld going back.

686
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
And then here you talk a little bit also about Jimmy Carter

687
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,520
and also his involvement with Sheehan, which I found so interesting.

688
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,080
Because of course, before he took office,

689
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,240
Carter was pretty outspoken about UFOs

690
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
and wanting to investigate the situation

691
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,680
because he had his own personal siting.

692
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,160
And then while he was president,

693
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,720
Carter wanted to move a little bit off of oil and so forth.

694
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,480
And according to Sheehan, I've talked about this a few times,

695
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
Sheehan was sent by Jimmy Carter

696
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,600
to access the classified section of Blue Book files.

697
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,120
And that is where the infamous story,

698
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,800
he saw a photo of a crash retrieval with symbols drawn on it.

699
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,360
You mentioned Michael Schrat's drawings of those.

700
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,720
I kind of wanted to bring those up too while we discuss this incident

701
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,000
because this is great.

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,360
So Michael Schrat, I think, held a drawing competition for the alleged.

703
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,400
Crash that Sheehan discussed.

704
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,280
And I think this was 79, right? 79?

705
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,680
No, it's a 77.

706
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,520
So the story that Sheehan has been telling is that

707
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,400
I think it was like nine days after Carter was elected.

708
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,560
That was kind of a prime interest to him.

709
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,200
And he summoned Bush down to his home at Savannah.

710
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,280
And just asked him, like, cool,

711
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,280
what's going on with this UFO stuff?

712
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
And Bush told him, like, I'm only going to tell you

713
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
if you keep me on as director.

714
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,120
Carter said, no, it's fine.

715
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:06,400
So he ousted Bush when he took office and then had Sheehan go into the Blue Book.

716
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
However, that worked out.

717
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,120
He actually got in and found this photo

718
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,800
and made that drawing and everything.

719
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,440
And then there's the famous story, of course.

720
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,960
I don't know if this is validated or not of Jimmy Carter

721
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,600
receiving some sort of briefing to some extent on UFOs

722
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,400
and basically was left in a catatonic crying state.

723
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,560
I don't know if that story's been substantiated or not.

724
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,800
I mean, that's I'm looking into that.

725
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,040
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty popular.

726
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,880
And I think, oh, man, I forget.

727
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,480
Somebody had commented recently that, yeah,

728
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,040
one of those other guys may have been like in the room

729
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,480
when he got that.

730
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,760
OK, I forget who exactly.

731
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,400
And I don't know if I put it in any of the threads.

732
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,000
I think it was after I wrote all of this stuff.

733
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,680
But yeah, I mean, if you look at the 77 timeline,

734
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,840
so he so Bush is out as director.

735
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,880
And Carter does away with the Atomic Energy Commission.

736
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,760
There's some other particulars yet.

737
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,000
That splits into the DOE and NNSA.

738
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,080
A lot of people don't look at records or pay attention to the NNSA.

739
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,280
They only pay attention to the DOE in regards to legacy programs.

740
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,040
However, especially back in the 80s,

741
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,600
NNSA was a cataloging reports of UAP over nuclear sites throughout the US.

742
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,840
Oh, interesting.

743
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,560
OK, I didn't know that.

744
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
So sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

745
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,080
You were talking about 1977.

746
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,560
I mean, I think what makes sense to me is that he goes to Bush, gets denied,

747
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,920
Bush is out.

748
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,080
He does away with the Atomic Energy Commission, I think,

749
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,920
in like right away, February or March.

750
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,720
He has she and go in.

751
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,040
I forget.

752
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,760
I think that might have been March as well.

753
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,720
I think Carter gets briefed in May or June,

754
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,160
and then immediately signs into law the DOE.

755
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,360
And the DOE becomes established in mid-August, I think.

756
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
And so it's like, who knows this tech exists?

757
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
He's coming off of the oil crisis.

758
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,160
I'd done it for a completely different project years ago.

759
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,880
I did a lot of research into that stuff, OPEC and all that.

760
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,880
So I think there's a very clear timeline in that Carter knows this is all real,

761
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,360
and he knows we can be doing something better and we can be off of oil.

762
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,840
But I think the grand irony is that he establishes the DOE,

763
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,080
which is set up at the James Forest Hall building of all places.

764
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,200
And then they use the DOE just to keep hiding all the same stuff.

765
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,000
Right.

766
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,640
Yeah, of course, in 54, there's the Atomic Energy Agreement, which to this day

767
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,160
keeps materials from ever being declassified UAP materials as they can be

768
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,920
misclassified as transnuclear foreign material.

769
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,840
And then, of course, the DOE and NNSA have other regulations.

770
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,840
So I was surprised to learn in one of my recent projects was of some of the

771
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,440
hypothetical reverse engineering and craft programs out at Nellis Area 51 and so forth,

772
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,440
that DOE owns much of the land there in the Nevada test and training range.

773
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,880
Right.

774
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
And yeah, I learned a lot of that recently, too.

775
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,680
I think they also own the land at Los Alamos.

776
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,080
And so that's kind of this weird deal where they own the land,

777
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,040
they lease it to the contractors, and I think also to the military.

778
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,280
And so they are kind of the umbrella over a lot of this stuff.

779
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,800
And I don't understand like what it means if they, you know, was admitted by,

780
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,520
was it Stephanie Granholm?

781
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,800
I think so.

782
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,840
With a, you know, Birchhead and Luna Cornerher, you know, make her admit that the DOE

783
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,440
works with JSOCs in times.

784
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,440
And his famous story of the firefight between JSOC and Lockheed,

785
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,360
and Coltart even validated that a couple of weeks ago and said,

786
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,040
yeah, that might not be the only one.

787
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,360
So I'm still kind of making sense of a lot of that stuff.

788
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,240
The DOE to the contractors and the military.

789
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:40,560
But then the, how does the DOE then have its own retrieval team apart from those people?

790
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:40,800
Yeah.

791
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,920
And I think that retrieval team is likely the NEST teams,

792
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,440
something I've talked about a couple of times in the Jonathan Waygant story.

793
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,320
Have you heard of NEST?

794
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:49,840
Yeah.

795
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,520
The Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

796
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,280
So one of the interesting things is, guess which company NEST is?

797
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,520
One of the contractors NEST is housed out of EG&G,

798
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,280
which we'll talk about in one second.

799
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,240
So DOE has even more ties, because I can't wait to launch into this part,

800
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,080
because this is where I think I can add a little bit of really interesting pieces.

801
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,520
Tell me how the heck you connected EG&G and the Carlisle Group into this,

802
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,520
because the Carlisle Group especially, I don't think nearly enough people talk about.

803
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,160
And once we talk about that, I'm going to give a,

804
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,120
I'm going to connect Carlisle Group to modern day disinformation with Sean Kirkpatrick.

805
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,440
So that'll be a bit fun.

806
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,320
Okay. I've been curious like where they stand now.

807
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:39,200
Okay. So yeah, it was when Ross gave that talk and ended it with bringing up EG&G.

808
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,440
So EG&G was a high speed photography company, run by three guys.

809
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,760
Like those were their initials, funny enough.

810
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,640
And they were brought in to film the nuclear test.

811
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,280
And I think it was also because of them probably that they were catching,

812
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,960
you know, the craft or orbs or whatever was showing up around these test sites.

813
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,520
And who knows what else they caught.

814
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,880
And then post-Roswell, you know, I think it was, there was like December 47

815
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,920
at the behest of the military.

816
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,040
They were basically asked to become, I'm forgetting now,

817
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,960
like a joint enterprise or something so they could be contracted out.

818
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,440
However that stuff all works.

819
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,640
And so it sounds like basically they became the lead contractor.

820
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,240
Like they were where things went, partly where things went private kind of right away.

821
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,200
That the military could do what they wanted, but all the paperwork was at EG&G basically.

822
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,360
And and then, you know, wherever people will stand on the czar and all that, you know,

823
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,000
I think it was Bob Echler, you know, who said back in the 90s that EG&G was his employer.

824
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,760
They are basically the employer area 51, you know, and they run Janet Airlines.

825
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,080
You know, it's like they kind of run a lot of that show.

826
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,040
Which that that confirmation of EG&G working or employing people at area 51 was later confirmed

827
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,880
and who we'll talk about in a second with Eric Tabor and his Aero testimony.

828
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Oh, interesting. Okay. I'm not familiar with that.

829
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,920
EG&G also interestingly enough, as I'm sure a lot of people know,

830
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,080
is the parking lot where Admiral Thomas Wilson and Eric Davis met

831
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,040
for the classic Wilson Davis notes, which is great.

832
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,560
So you here in this post connected Ross Colthardt.

833
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:45,440
And we kind of started off talking about this within this engineering badge from area 51 here.

834
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,120
What did you take away from this?

835
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,920
And then we'll talk about Eric Tabor, who this was his patch from his great,

836
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,120
it was from his great uncle, I believe it was.

837
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,640
Oh, right. Is he the guy? That's right. Okay.

838
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,600
I think he saw it and then after his uncle died, like his uncle told him a story or something.

839
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,040
Right. Right. Right.

840
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,840
Yeah. This is again, you know, when I first saw this Colthardt straight up says like,

841
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,560
oh, the internet's going to go crazy over this. Right.

842
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,960
And I don't remember really seeing many people talk about it at all. No.

843
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,440
So I posted it back then, just like, what does anybody think this means?

844
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,520
And people just came at me for getting the Star Trek references wrong. Oh, really?

845
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,000
And I was like, Star Trek, take, take, take their stuff seriously.

846
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah. I mean, sure. You know, it's just like, that's a very ancillary part of this.

847
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,920
But he does say that, you know, that I forget what it is. It was at 1-1-0-0, 1-0-0-1. Yes.

848
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:58,160
So it's a reference to a specific next generation episode about the binars who steal.

849
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:05,360
I watched it a couple of times after I read this, the binars who steal the enterprise

850
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,880
to go help their planet or something. And it ends with like, why didn't you just ask us for help?

851
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,560
Right. And I think it's like Picard and I'll get the other guy's name wrong.

852
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,640
They're like, oh, we didn't, there was some, yeah, I think they asked the binars,

853
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,280
like why didn't you just ask us for help? And they're like, oh, we didn't know if you would.

854
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,920
So we just kind of, you know, did things on our own. So I don't know. I mean, maybe that's part of

855
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:44,800
the story that some faction of NHI or something are, you know, getting help without our agreement.

856
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,680
Or I don't know. I really don't know, you know, and then, but I did see digging into this more

857
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,120
than Measure Analyze Protect. It might have been C. Britton or somebody else who'd found that

858
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,080
that phrase comes up a lot in a lot of the DOE.

859
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,600
So for anybody watching that doesn't know the story of this patch, this originated from Arrow

860
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,480
Whistleblower who conveniently wasn't mentioned in the historical report. Eric Tabor, who I think

861
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:19,600
in 2023, he testified to Arrow that his great uncle, I think his last name was Eurekart or something,

862
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,640
he worked at Area 51 in the capacity of a sergeant from 1997 to 2014 as the head of

863
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:34,160
security for like a radar cross-section facility at Area 51. And here he was privy to like images

864
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,560
and photographs and so forth of a classic egg-shaped craft that according to what the

865
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,920
uncle told Eric Tabor was just found abandoned in the desert. So supporting kind of the donation

866
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,720
theory that Grush talked about, a seamless egg-shaped craft, maybe the size of a family car.

867
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,240
Let's see if we can find an image of it because I actually have the article pulled up here and

868
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,840
I'm sorry for the Daily Mail's ad pop-ups. I don't have an ad block right here. Yes,

869
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:05,280
I use this image quite a bit. This is Eric Tabor. What year was that? His uncle, Eric Tabor,

870
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,160
testified in 2023. Sam Yerka, I cannot pronounce that last name on the fly, was an Area 51 contractor

871
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,200
from 97 to 2014. And Tabor is like an aerospace engineer, pretty well respected. Sorry, let me

872
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,800
find images of that patch. Yeah. Wait, did he say when he saw that craft? No, I can't remember.

873
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,880
He didn't give an exact date during the time. But of course, Tabor says his uncle was a contractor

874
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,600
at Area 51 on the behest of EGNG. Which is to me part of, I mean, every now and then there's some

875
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:44,720
kind of cosmic humor in this that you've got, you know, an egg-shaped craft at, you know, EGNG

876
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,520
facilities. Oh, okay. So actually, maybe we do have a date. He said when he first got there in

877
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,960
1997, I had a personal conversation with a senior EGNG engineer whose group was tasked with trying

878
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,840
to reverse engineer an object that was brought there by some CIA people in the 1980s. Which

879
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:06,400
that's interesting to me because that might talk about the CIA and CIA, OGA and JSOC participating

880
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,160
in retrievals even before kind of the start of the OGA in 2003. Right. 2002, 2001. But that of

881
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,760
course is for foreign retrieval. So who knows who knows what kind of a retrieval the CIA may have

882
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,160
had their hands in. Yeah, eventually. Do you know when and I was trying to find this the other day

883
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,720
when in 2003, OGA became its own agency? No, I'm trying to think back to Chris Sharpe's reporting.

884
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,800
But I can't remember exactly when I don't know if a date is listed there.

885
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,400
Because I, yeah, I think it's, well, you haven't read part eight yet and that's when things get

886
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,280
really fun. Okay, okay. So we'll continue on so we can get to part eight. Now, one of the companies

887
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,720
that ran EGNG from 1997 to 2001 that you bring up is of course the Carlisle Group. The Carlisle

888
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,880
Group has been implicated many times as one of the lead proponents of the control group of the UAP

889
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,200
topic. What did you find out about the Carlisle Group within this within this piece part five?

890
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,520
Oh, man. I'm not sure how some of that info was divvied up between these.

891
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:25,760
Yeah, it just really stuck out to me that they were so they make a they made a deal

892
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:39,920
in 96 with the Saudis, Saudi royalty. And that money goes back to the Bush family back to

893
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,480
at least 51 with Zapata oil. So those guys have been working together a long time. And

894
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,960
I think over time, EGNG kept getting split up into like different

895
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:03,040
not branches, but like different subholding companies or something. Right. And so it just

896
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:11,360
stuck out that you've got, you know, Carlisle, it turns out that their board was Bush,

897
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:23,280
his secretary, State James Baker, UK Prime Minister, John Major. Oh, really? I didn't know that.

898
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,800
Carlucci, who was part of his staff. And I'm forgetting another guy who was part of his staff.

899
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:39,120
So it was like Bush and three of his top White House people all basically at the head of Carlisle

900
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:46,880
Group alongside billionaire and chef Rubenstein. Right. So in 1987, David Rubenstein, he was the

901
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,440
domestic policy advisor to Carter when he started the Carlisle Group. That's right. And

902
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,400
that's funny. You mentioned Frank Carlucci. I need to know if one of my guys Kai is in the chat

903
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,080
right now. Kai is really big into the subject of ARV as Greer puts it. And that mention of Frank

904
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,960
Carlucci, if he's here, I need to bring something up to him real fast because Frank, the specific

905
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,360
mention of Frank Carlucci with the Carlisle Group is what I think is one of the most

906
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,520
consequential mentions here. I know it's, I know it's like a one sentence thing when you got heavy

907
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,960
hitters like Rubenstein and the Bush family and the dozens of Saudi investors within Carlisle Group.

908
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:28,000
But how familiar are you with the Mark McCandless story? And Kai, if you're in the chat, please

909
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,040
comment because I know you're going to love this. Maybe if I got a refresher, I feel like the name

910
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,160
sounds kind of familiar, but yeah. Okay. So Mark McCandless was an aerospace illustrator who

911
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:44,240
testified at Greer's disclosure project briefing in 2001. Mark McCandless did tons of aerospace

912
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,600
work, was a very well respected artist with Lockheed Martin various defense contractors.

913
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:57,120
In 1988, his fellow aerospace illustrator, Brad Sorensen invited Mark McCandless to go to Norton

914
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,560
Air Force Base, California for an air show. McCandless had some last minute projects for,

915
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,360
I think it was popular mechanics, so he ended up not going. Brad Sorensen, when he went to

916
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,480
Norton Air Force Base, saw the air show saw some experimental craft, but he was with an individual

917
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:21,040
that he described to Mark later on. And this individual and Brad Sorensen, allegedly, but I

918
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,720
think this is far more than just an alleged story because I'm going to cover it in the

919
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,560
near future and I have some additional info on this story. I think people might find interesting

920
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:35,600
are taken to a kind of wardened off section of this air base at Norton and admitted by a general

921
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,240
or a three, I think it was a two or three star general Air Force general. And the individual

922
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,600
that Brad Sorensen is with says that Brad is eight, so they can get in here. There are three

923
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,640
flying saucer craft referenced as alien reproduction vehicles. This is where the term is coined.

924
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,280
They function off of electrogravity or zero point technologies. They're the they're the classic

925
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,080
flux liner design, if you've ever heard of that. Yeah, it's a it's three craft sizes, the smallest

926
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,600
one being like 40 feet across, the largest one being like 100 200 feet across, all with similar

927
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:11,600
designs, all with oxygen tanks sitting radially in the crash all craft all with like capacitor

928
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,800
plates on the bottom, all with a crew compartment with I think three seats facing around each other.

929
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,680
This is a very interesting story because McCandillish made a new let me pull up the

930
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,720
drawing of the flux liner just so people can see this while I talk about it.

931
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,800
So one one funny thing to kind of backtrack a tiny bit about the Watertown stuff is that

932
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:43,360
that was one of the locations at Area 51. And there's a very specific EG&G office

933
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:56,720
that is opened on July 24, 1969, the day the astronauts come back. Oh, interesting.

934
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,160
Office gets established. And then later, I don't know the timeline here, but later,

935
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:10,640
the DOE is at that exact same address. Interesting. Yeah. So the the point I bring up

936
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,680
about the ARV Mark McCandillish and Brad Sorenson is because that senior advisor

937
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:23,600
that took Brad to this classified section of this air show was none other than Frank Carlucci.

938
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:30,800
Oh, wow. So that's a really, really, really damn interesting connection because Carlucci is

939
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,560
associated with Carlisle Group. Wait, what when was the November 13, 1988.

940
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,040
So a year after Carlisle Group is formed. And of course, Mark McCandillish was

941
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:51,280
unalived in 2021. Wait, what's so what's his story? I'm so as an aerospace illustrator after he was

942
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,240
talked to by Brad about these designs, he and Brad worked for concept art for the ARV craft.

943
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,880
Over time, he would talk about these craft and zero point systems until 2014,

944
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,440
a documentary filmmaker named James Allen made a documentary called him called like zero point

945
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,160
Mark McCandillish. Towards before the inner before the documentary was ever released,

946
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,720
James Allen was diagnosed and killed by a super aggressive form of cancer within the span of

947
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,000
weeks. And in his autopsy report, he was also found to have suffered from metal poisoning, heavy

948
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,840
metal poisoning. About this same time, Mark McCandillish said he slept with a gun under his bed

949
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,600
out of fear for his life. In 2021, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. I think I just

950
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:38,320
heard this the other day or maybe he was catching up on your last on your episode from last week.

951
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,000
That's right. I think we talked about that in live a little bit. Yeah. So Carlucci and the

952
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,040
Carlisle group may be may be entwined with reverse engineering practices. And how this goes

953
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:57,200
further is you, you're probably pretty familiar with Sean Kirkpatrick, right? Yeah. Do you remember

954
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:04,000
in 2022, 2023, I can't remember exactly when when Arrow did a round table talk with Sean Kirkpatrick

955
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,280
and former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie.

956
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,960
Yeah. I think I watched that when it came out, but I don't remember any of the details really.

957
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,000
So Moultrie was like a huge big wig. It was here. The two said there was nothing to UAP. There was

958
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,800
absolutely nothing. Well, Moultrie, as it turns out, sorry, let me reference my notes. Moultrie is

959
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,720
a board member for the Better Angels, which was funded by David Rubenstein, the founder of Carlisle

960
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:40,880
Group. And he is a board member in iCapital, which is Carlisle Group's most invested in

961
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,840
group. So even Ronald Moultrie now has connections to Carlisle Group. Ronald Moultrie has had influence,

962
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:53,280
or as in cahoots with Sean Kirkpatrick previously as well. Right. Okay. So I found that

963
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,360
all with the DOE since he was like 17. So I found that, and then of course goes to Oak Ridge,

964
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,840
National Labs, once he leaves Arrow. Well, yeah, I mean, Oak Ridge is the entire loop.

965
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:14,320
Yeah. So just said Vannevar Bush, you know, and I think he got the directions to do that in 41

966
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:22,560
from FDR, sets it up at 42. Whatever the timeline there is for MJ12, you know, and Vannevar Bush

967
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:29,520
and everybody else. And then now we're right back to the DOE and Oak Ridge. Kirkpatrick goes

968
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:36,880
there. And yeah, I just found, I was so happy when I read part five, just with EGNG and so forth.

969
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:43,920
I love that because I think those, so I think those corporations are, EGNG has had some fame

970
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,640
because of its association with Bob Lazar, but especially the Carlisle Group. I was so happy

971
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:56,640
you made these ties here. Yeah. And that was, you know, I tried getting there months ago, you

972
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:03,760
know, but I was still just wrapping my head around everything that was coming out. And that was

973
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,160
actually where I wanted specifically to get back to. I didn't even intend to make this huge like

974
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,160
series or whatever, you know, I was like, oh, let me just get back to the Carlisle, EGNG stuff.

975
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,040
And then everything, it was like, as I kept digging, it was like, everything kept growing

976
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,920
really fast. Oh man, okay, this is all huge. This is all one story, you know.

977
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,240
And then of course, things get even bigger when we get to part six, where you mentioned

978
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,080
SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation. Now, did you get a chance recently

979
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:40,320
to see Kermit's post on kind of the financials of UAP legacy programs? And he talks about

980
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:46,320
the startup of SAIC after various SEC regulations, which basically allow corporations to keep two

981
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:52,320
books, one on record, one off record and so forth. No, I didn't see that. No, it's a wonderful piece.

982
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,040
It harped back to, I think there was one interview in 2021, Lou Elizondo talked about,

983
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,840
he referenced two defense contractors under the pseudonyms company A and company B,

984
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,480
and them gaining unfair advantages within the SAIC, I mean, SEC, due to having exotic technologies.

985
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:16,160
Right. Okay. Yeah, I mean, the SAIC stuff, I only really know about because of a still chill

986
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:25,360
drill. They like focus specifically on that eventually, and looking at a lot of the records

987
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,040
and stuff. And then going back and forth, we were, again, figuring out timeline, where it looks like

988
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:41,040
basically blue book closes at the end of, I think Alan Dulles dies in January 69. Yeah.

989
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,560
And then by the end of the year, blue book closes. And in that time, I've not, I've been

990
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:53,120
able to find an actual month. But at some point, SAIC is started. And so it looks like basically

991
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:59,760
that's where blue book maybe goes private. So now I have a way to circle back to your research as

992
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:06,400
well, kind of with SAIC and Malmgren. And sorry, I'm forgetting his name, Bissell as well. So Bissell

993
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,960
tells Malmgren about other world technologies, basically a division that studies other world

994
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:17,360
technologies. I have made a video on an off world technologies division that I with a lot of research

995
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:24,320
highly suspect was ran by SAIC. So now even more, even more parallels to your research.

996
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:31,200
Interesting. So Bissell tells Malmgren this in 63, I think it was. Yes.

997
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:43,840
And then, yeah, SAIC starts in 69. I haven't had a chance to dig into, you know, any direct

998
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,280
connections. It's more just like, it's all at the same time, basically. So SAIC is so weird.

999
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:55,120
And I'm sure you heard about all the stuff with Chris Sharpe in his Liberation Times article

1000
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,400
in Undersea Retrievals, right? Well, he mentions Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, guess who

1001
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,080
has plenty of contracts with the Office of Naval Research and the NSW Crane, which is the,

1002
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,840
which is basically a naval research in electromagnetic and expeditionary weapon lab.

1003
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,760
And Woods Hole SAIC. So SAIC, Kermit and I talk about this a lot, but they kind of have their

1004
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,320
hands in every single piece of the pie here. So it just makes so much sense that they would kind

1005
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:30,560
of fall into your research. Yeah, right. Okay. God, this is, yeah, I mean, yeah, the more this

1006
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:37,600
keeps going, I mean, I think to, you know, going back over, you know, just building the supercut

1007
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:43,360
stuff, you know, I'm looking to make a proper documentary on the magenta incident and all

1008
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:51,760
that. And so I've been going back over, you know, all of Grush's, I mean, outside of Coltart, you

1009
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:59,440
know, he did a podcast with Rebedra Panatti and Guzardi and, you know, and then Panatti

1010
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:06,000
to the thing with Strieber talked about it. And it's come up a few other times, but

1011
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,160
I mean, Grush says right away with Coltart, he's like, yeah, it's received by the OSS

1012
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,240
back panel via the Vatican. OSS becomes a CIA and he throws it out there. You know, and then when

1013
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:25,280
he goes on Rogan, Rogan asked him, you know, about this, you know, he's like, oh, I just wanted to

1014
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:31,280
show that this goes further back. And it's international. And I thought that was interesting.

1015
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,040
And you're like, no, you knew what you were doing. You're making sure that like all of us nerds,

1016
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,520
like really dig into this stuff, you know, because it's not just some other interesting case or just

1017
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,400
some crash retrieval. It's like everything about who we are as a country and maybe a world kind of

1018
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:57,360
starts there. It starts with the Bush clan getting their hands on this, you know, and again, these

1019
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,960
people starting the CIA, keeping this stuff secret, running a rough shot all over the world, you know,

1020
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:09,040
however many coups, you know, they were a part of, you know, just like ugly stuff that is

1021
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:16,000
well known, you know, to anyone who reads history at all, you know, and so you start to see like,

1022
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,800
oh, yeah, this is all like just one big kind of evil empire, you know, that it's like, it's true.

1023
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,000
And I love the fact that Grush was able to kind of walk things back a little bit because

1024
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,240
most people who have just kind of a fleeting interest in the subject think of Roswell as the

1025
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:37,600
real start of, you know, possible reverse engineering programs when some people familiar with MJ-12

1026
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:45,120
might think 1941 Cape Jurado is kind of the nexus point, but Grush walking it back further to 1933

1027
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:51,280
Magenta. And who knows, are there possible cases before that as well, such as 1897 of Rora, Texas,

1028
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,800
or if the claims of Bob Lazar are true, a craft that was found in an archaeological dig and so

1029
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:04,880
forth. Yeah, I think I heard really recently that, yeah, Lazar said it came from somewhere in like

1030
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:11,920
the Southwest. Oh, did he? I didn't know he gave us. Somebody commented this a few days ago that,

1031
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,640
yeah, he said something about, yeah, this is really new to me, that I guess, yeah, it was brought in

1032
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,680
and they think it might have crashed like a thousand years ago or so. Wow, that I've been

1033
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,320
kept up to date with the kind of, I don't know, yeah. And then the Aurora thing, yeah, I was familiar

1034
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:34,400
with, I mean, you know, the airship stuff at that time. And even that's a funny one because it's like

1035
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:43,760
the sink crashes into a windmill. Yeah, it's like, it's almost like, like, analogous power in a way,

1036
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,480
you know, that, that if that was an airship, you know, and it's like, if these things are

1037
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:58,960
constantly sort of like pushing us to, you know, advance our science. And then you've got, I mean,

1038
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,680
I've been reading more lately about radar and death rays, which is like pretty new to me, like

1039
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:13,360
radar comes from the search for a death ray, which is basically your first EMP. Interesting. Yeah.

1040
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:19,520
So you've got like, Marconi, I'm gonna, maybe I'll do that tonight. Yeah. Marconi, you know,

1041
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:28,480
Nobel Prize winner was put in charge of researching your experimenting on the magenta craft by Enrico

1042
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Fermi of all people who said this whole thing was kind of bullshit. With a famous Fermi paradox

1043
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,440
that's very lacking. Turns out he said while he was walking with Edward Teller and two other people.

1044
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,360
So I think he was trying to throw somebody else right at Los Alamos. Yeah, at Los Alamos,

1045
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:51,680
I forgot, I forgot about that part. Just learned that recently. But Marconi, you know, he invented

1046
01:04:51,680 --> 01:05:02,800
radio. And then he was also known for studying electromagnetism in the ionosphere. And I'm

1047
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:07,520
really, I don't know if there'd be any way to find out, but I'm really curious if he was testing out

1048
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,280
his death ray and accidentally brought this craft down.

1049
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:19,280
Interesting. And for anybody who doesn't know, Marconi was implicated in the alleged RB33,

1050
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,640
the internal Italian documents that stated he was kind of the basically in charge of

1051
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,240
analyzing this craft that crashed in 33. And then in 2024, Panodi came out with more

1052
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:36,720
documents vindicating the actual legitimate creation of RB33. So that is, that's pretty

1053
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:43,120
interesting. Did you say RB or is it RS? It might be, it's RS. I'm sorry. I was thinking about the

1054
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:48,400
RB47 jet while I was talking about that. Because it was a special research. Yes. Okay. Yes. Thank you.

1055
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,480
And so part seven, this piece was actually taken down. So what, what new, what? Yeah,

1056
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,880
that just came down a couple of nights ago, because I guess it wasn't UFO-centric enough.

1057
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,880
What new points kind of, can you talk about that you talked about in this one before we move into

1058
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:14,240
eight? I think, where did I end up here? Oh, right. I mean, this was, it's really ended up just being

1059
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:25,200
about kind of the crossover between skull and bones. And yeah, there's a, you know, pretty famous story

1060
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:31,600
about Prescott Bush was a part of this group that dug up at least what they thought. I don't,

1061
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,440
I think there were some, it turns out there was some dispute about whether or not it was really

1062
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:43,200
him, but, you know, dug up the grave of Geronimo. Interesting. Yeah. Like, like had his skull

1063
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,240
at their facility, you know, and just some weird black magic stuff there. And so,

1064
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,440
you know, you kind of start looking at, and then, you know, they start Zapata oil,

1065
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:02,720
or, you know, Prescott Bush and Dulles, you know, start Zapata oil in 51 with the help of the CIA,

1066
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,040
you know, and it turns out it was like a front for the CIA. But even that, it's like,

1067
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:14,640
they were sort of like these middle fingers from these white colonizers. It's kind of how I look

1068
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:20,000
at it, you know. And so, I think part of what's happening now, even just culturally in general,

1069
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,120
but let alone this topic and, you know, trying to reveal this true history is like

1070
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:34,400
this notion of, like, ugly colonization before we go anywhere else, you know, before we actually go

1071
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,800
to Mars and beyond, you know what I mean? It's like, we need to do away with a lot of that notion

1072
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:45,600
of colonization. And so, I think you start to see, like, that's part of what this whole empire has

1073
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:52,240
been from the beginning, you know, just like these white men with power, you know, who's hated more

1074
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,520
on the planet at the moment, you know. It's like the rich white elite, basically, that have been

1075
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,560
running things into the ground, you know, and so we get to see kind of where some of that starts,

1076
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,880
you know, in the modern age at least. And then it's, and then I ended up on Bohemian Grove,

1077
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,880
and it turns out it's all the same people, you know, it's like all these king makers,

1078
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,080
basically. And that's kind of the joke, you know, that, like, 36 and still Chill and I talk about,

1079
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,000
you know, it's just like, oh, yeah, this is what it is. It's just these people wanted to be kings,

1080
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,360
you know. And Bohemian Grove is similar to Skull and Bones. It's like a secret society that nobody

1081
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:33,680
knows what the heck they actually do, besides do weird dances. Yeah. And they, you know, it's

1082
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,280
worship of an owl and a bunch of other stuff. And we know there's like the Mike Cleland, you know,

1083
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:45,520
owl UFO stuff. And, oh, right. And up Solica has talked about that. And so,

1084
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,000
yeah, I don't know. I haven't read enough into it. I just kind of know some of that cursory stuff.

1085
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:55,520
So let's move on to point eight. I heard part eight. I don't know what dang thing about this.

1086
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,000
It, I hadn't read this. I asked you if it came out and you told me yes. So what can you tell me

1087
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,240
about this? Because I think it involves a little bit of sort of like the black magic you were talking

1088
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:10,400
about with the with Iraq and so forth. Yeah. And maybe, yeah, I mean, without having

1089
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,880
predetermined any of this and kind of writing it out, you know, as kind of in real time,

1090
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,120
I guess to go to, you know, to end up at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove

1091
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,480
and whatever they were doing there. And then to close off with like Stargate and the Tomb of

1092
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:35,200
Gilgamesh. I mean, that was a thing that kept coming up. You know, everyone's been on the hunt

1093
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:44,320
for Colt Hart's UFO too big to move. Right. It's come up a few times that, you know, the U.S.

1094
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:51,520
Embassy in Iraq looks like it could be, you know, where this all is. And then I think at some

1095
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:58,400
points, you know, a couple of people brought up the fact that the Tomb of Gilgamesh was reported

1096
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:06,720
found like barely over a week before we invaded. And there's some other stuff too I found recently

1097
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:12,080
within like that timeframe, I forget, but some weird stuff, some business dealings and stuff. And so

1098
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:21,280
that's why I was wondering like when specifically JSOC was set up. Oh, interesting. Like all part

1099
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,480
of this story of JSOC is answering to Cheney. Cheney's the one who was basically running the

1100
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,480
Bush administration. Just like Bush Senior was running the Reagan administration, you know,

1101
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:40,160
the Bush family through the Western Company. Global Defense, which is under dresser industries,

1102
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,920
is one of the contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Holly Burton famously was the big one. So it's

1103
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:54,480
like these guys probably behind 9-11, let it happen. There's a famous, you know, they had a meeting

1104
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:00,480
that morning with the Saudis. It's the Carlisle Group in the Saudis. And then 9-11 happens.

1105
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,480
Didn't Rumsfeld, I think a couple of days before 9-11, talk about like two or three trillion

1106
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:12,320
dollars missing at the Pentagon as well? The day before. Okay, day before. Interesting.

1107
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:19,200
Yeah, September 10. I just read that again. So you were talking about the Iraqi embassy,

1108
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:25,120
I think even before Ross coming out and talking about the massive UFO buried under some sort of

1109
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,840
construction, there were stories that the Iraqi embassy was built over a UFO, as well as other

1110
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,080
stories in the kind of somewhat local area of the Middle East. There's some rich Munda stories,

1111
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:40,160
like a 1958 crash retrieval occurring in Kabul, Afghanistan and so forth. So there's actually

1112
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:46,000
a lot of really rich lore in the Middle East that I don't even think has been begun to be explored

1113
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:56,160
until your piece. So yeah, I think part of this, so yeah, I've been kind of hearing that stuff.

1114
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:04,320
And then, you know, I haven't read either of the Skinwalker books, but I caught up on an older

1115
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:11,840
apocaster a couple of years ago with George Knapp that kind of re-aired with, I think, on UAP

1116
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:17,680
studies, you know, this was a couple months ago. But he basically walks through the timeline of,

1117
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:27,040
you know, Bigelow and NIDS in the late 90s, early 2000s. And then you've got Bass, which is basically

1118
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:34,560
where a lot of, you know, UFO reports and stuff are being sent in the 2000s. And then whatever

1119
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:43,040
happens there to, you know, ASAP and then ATIP. And what really stuck out to me was that he said that

1120
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:50,000
when Hunt for the Skinwalker came out, you know, that was Knapp and Kelleher,

1121
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,920
then it got passed around to people at the DIA in the Middle East, like Likatsky.

1122
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,520
Interesting.

1123
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:03,680
And so you're like, oh, okay, Likatsky was working for the DIA in the Middle East in 2007.

1124
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,560
Maybe the year after we build this embassy and they're looking for stuff, you know,

1125
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,200
like it would kind of make sense if that was all tied together. And also 2007,

1126
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,640
I don't know what he was doing, but Kirk Patrick was part of some joint CIA DIA operation.

1127
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:31,120
And I know it came out recently. I know Carl Nell was on like the first team

1128
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:38,400
that went over there in 2003. And I think Elizondo was also on another like first team that went

1129
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,640
over there. So I don't know. Yeah. It's just a lot of stuff around this. And then it gets weirder.

1130
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,360
So scrolling through the article, I see you bring up a picture of the alleged Holloman Air Force

1131
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,800
base tape, which was actually just talked about by James Fox in his interview with Jesse Michaels.

1132
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,400
James Fox stated in one of his documentaries, he interviewed a guy that had seen this tape.

1133
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,480
What is the context here of including this clip or including this image?

1134
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,840
I don't remember. What did Cameron say? Something about,

1135
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,760
because it's Cameron who's been tying Cheney into a lot of this stuff.

1136
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,600
But Carter knew what Cheney knew eventually.

1137
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:22,720
Right.

1138
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,280
I don't remember exactly.

1139
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,680
Okay. Yeah. You're talking about Grant Cameron and Jimmy Carter. Here we mentioned the story of

1140
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,880
Carter crying. I still don't know. We still don't know if that's a legitimate story or not.

1141
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,280
She hand talking about Carter's election. Let's see if possibly under here. Okay. Jimmy Carter.

1142
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:50,320
Oh, oh, cool. Okay. Here. Okay. So Grant Cameron commented on this. So apparently this 15 minute

1143
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:55,440
film was shown to Jimmy Carter. Grant Cameron states this. Grant Cameron is a fantastic researcher.

1144
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,280
And this film, without reading this clip just from my head, apparently shows a saucer with

1145
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:06,880
three landing gear touching down, a hatch opening up from a smooth surface that doesn't show any

1146
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,720
sort of view holes, port holes, signs of propulsion, all the classic observables of a craft. A sort of

1147
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:18,880
runway comes down. Three beans come out. They look like tall humanoid individuals wearing headgear

1148
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:26,000
that a film altars said looked like Egyptian headdresses. And so James Fox talked about this

1149
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,040
video quite a bit in his recent interview with Jesse Michaels and said he interviewed

1150
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,480
I can't remember the exact person. Yeah. I'm almost done with that interview.

1151
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,680
It's really dang good so far. Yeah. That's great.

1152
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:46,240
Interesting. So according to Grant Cameron, Carter had seen this footage. And in the footage,

1153
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:52,160
I think like the beans basically start interacting with humans, which is pretty

1154
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:58,800
darn interesting. It reminds me a lot of 1957. You know astronaut Gordon Cooper, he stated while

1155
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:04,880
he was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, he had a survey team film kind of remote parts of the

1156
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:11,680
base. And one of his survey teams caught a UAP landing that is same kind of saucer shaped craft,

1157
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:16,320
I think 40 feet in diameter. And when his film crew got close, the saucer within 20 yards of the

1158
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,120
craft it took off and he had seen this film and others had and then apparently it was confiscated.

1159
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,520
So that sounds very similar. I can't remember the exact date of this. 57. Okay. 57. Yeah. Then the

1160
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,640
Edwards might have been 54. So these I think were within three years, these two supposed films.

1161
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,440
Oh, right. Yeah. Because 50.

1162
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:46,880
I'm trying to, yeah, put all this together. Because wasn't. Oh, right. Okay. Because this,

1163
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:54,000
I think what I read and I mean, I don't, a lot of it wasn't verified, but I think there was talk that

1164
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:01,120
what I knew of Kingman, I know you did your video, you know, which I think probably the best

1165
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:10,080
one I saw, I mean, it was great too. You know, Kingman, the story that I understand is that

1166
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:20,960
there were like eight craft and there were dog fight and one crashes into the side of a cliff

1167
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:27,120
and it's totally demolished. One crashes into the ground. A guy's brought out to study it in

1168
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:33,840
engineer. And I think there's a dead body, one or two, I forget. That was the Stancil crash.

1169
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:40,000
Okay. And then, and then a third one is gifted. And that maybe these were the,

1170
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:47,360
like Eisenhower was at all three of the sites or something like that, that it was like

1171
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:55,280
the Kingman gifting was at one base, maybe at the Dugway site, which I know Greer's talked about

1172
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:02,720
a lot near Kingman. And then another one was Edwards and then there was a third one somewhere else.

1173
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:10,240
So that like one of these was the sites where possibly Eisenhower made his agreement and 53 or

1174
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:15,360
maybe it was this before, I'm not really sure. Because the Kingman kind of the multiple craft

1175
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,840
theory came from Harry Drew. And just like you said, over I think a week in March, seven days

1176
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:27,120
in March, his documentary, there were three separate crashes, one crash, one forced landing

1177
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:34,000
with which Arthur Stancil saw and one kind of gifted craft. Okay. Which is very interesting.

1178
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,800
And that documentary seven days in March or seven days in May, I can't remember, is almost

1179
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:46,800
impossible to track down. I've never heard of it. It's a, Harry Drew packaged it with a like a book,

1180
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,160
a limited release DVD. So I know a couple of like researchers who have been trying to track

1181
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:57,520
down that dang tape, but nobody has found it. It seemed like that 53 to 57 region had a

1182
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,040
time span had a lot of really interesting contacts because there's the Edwards Air Force Base

1183
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:08,800
touchdown, according to Gordon Cooper. There's the, there's the Holloman Air Force Base landing

1184
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,600
film according to Grant Cameron now that Jimmy Carter saw. And there's the Kingman crash all in

1185
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,960
the span of four years. Yeah. Right. Well, and that's coming after 52, you know, which was

1186
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:25,600
a pretty bonkers year as well. And 53 to start, we saw the Robertson panel as well. And 52 we see

1187
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:31,760
UFOs over Washington DC. Right. Right. Yeah. You know, I've, I haven't read all of the

1188
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,720
the Schellenberger document. You know, I've posted it a couple of times, but

1189
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:46,080
every 10 pages, I'm just like, I cannot, like this is crazy. Like, it's, you know,

1190
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:53,680
that's the, that's the timeline debrief for Congress, right? I, yeah, it's 177 pages or maybe

1191
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:59,280
that's just the first document or something. But yeah, it's just like, Oh, another craft,

1192
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,080
more dead bodies, whatever, you know, it's just like so routine for these guys, you know, whether

1193
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,760
you hit the nail on the head, it's exactly 177 pages.

1194
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:15,600
Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's like every time I started to get through it, it just spun me out so bad.

1195
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,080
You know, it was like, Oh, this is just completely normal. It became normal, you know,

1196
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,360
immediately after Roswell, basically, that like they kept finding, you know, these crashes and

1197
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,440
these dead beings and stuff, and they didn't care. You know, they were like, Oh, okay, just like,

1198
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,720
box them up, you know, we'll take care of them. Like, have you gotten a chance to read Leonard

1199
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:39,680
Stringfield's crash retrievals parts one through seven? I know I haven't read any of his stuff yet.

1200
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:46,880
No, I'll, I'll actually send you the PDF of that. That is in is so consequential to my research. And

1201
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,760
I think you follow the ufology in general, especially talking about crash retrievals and

1202
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:58,560
the subject of bodies. It is so fascinating. And Michael Schrat, this was in 2016, I think,

1203
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,120
was able to access the archives of Leonard Stringfield, who is now deceased in Cincinnati,

1204
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,400
and made a whole nother series of kind of crash retrieval cases that Leonard never published,

1205
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,880
including including discussion of the Edwards film as well. So there's a quite a tangible

1206
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,800
research line for the supposed films of craft touching down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually,

1207
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:27,040
I got to hang out with Michael Schrat last Sunday. Oh, did you? Oh, yeah, yeah, you told me. So I

1208
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:33,680
joined the Hollywood Disclosure Alliance early August to try and reach out to producers, you know,

1209
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:39,120
for documentary stuff. And so even that was like, Oh, I'm like emailing with Steve Bassett and,

1210
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:46,400
you know, Dan Harari. And, and then they had an event last Sunday, and it was Thomas Jane,

1211
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:55,440
Ron James from Mufon, and then Michael Schrat. And then we went to a dinner afterwards and

1212
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,800
the location kept getting moved, just some weird confusion, I guess. So it came down to like,

1213
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,000
eight of us or something. And I'm at this dinner table with like, Michael Schrat to my left,

1214
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,200
Steve Bassett to my right, you know, Dan Harari right in front of me. And I'm just like, Oh,

1215
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:17,280
okay, I guess this is my world now, you know. Now, did you get to talk with Schrat extensively

1216
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,520
about crash retrievals? Because he's just so well versed on on that subject. What'd you guys get

1217
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,400
to talk about? Yeah, I got to film in on magenta, because he didn't know any of the stuff yet.

1218
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,840
Right. He called me the next day, we talked for like 20, 30 minutes about it. And then he,

1219
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,040
we were, he wanted to meet up today, but I was like, Well, I'm doing this thing.

1220
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:40,480
And so we take president over Schrat, I'm honored, man. That's like an hour from me,

1221
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:46,240
it's fine. Yeah, he's pretty close. I know he's been looking for with his incredible drawings of

1222
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:52,400
craft and sightings used like by almost every researcher. He's been trying to find a more

1223
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:58,240
concrete description of the magenta craft to be able to draw because I think so the only real

1224
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,360
description we have is from Grush, like a lenticular shape. Yeah, right, right. Two saucers

1225
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:09,360
pressed against each other. That's slightly damaged, but whole integrity intact. Right, right.

1226
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,080
I mean, that's kind of what I walked in through and I was showing him,

1227
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,360
I don't know if he'd seen the Daily Mail article on, on that,

1228
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,440
it's the only big one that I've seen, but yeah, I was just showing him, I'm like,

1229
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,840
I don't know, this is all I've seen. And so, you know, I know that and whatever Grush said, you

1230
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,960
know, and so that's what he was trying to, you know, get down to is just like, what are the

1231
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,480
exact dimensions? How exactly, you know, did it crash? I'm like, I don't know, I'll send you some

1232
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:44,480
stuff. Still have all the way dating back to the magenta case, have you been able to kind of

1233
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:50,800
tie in any of the mega defense conglomerates like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Boeing, Northrop Grumman

1234
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:57,440
into, into your work as well alongside the EG and G Carlisle SAIC and some of the oil conglomerates?

1235
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:05,440
No, I mean, that stuff has been even, yeah, too confusing for me just to understand

1236
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:10,400
like the parallels, you know, between the defense contractors. I mean, I know,

1237
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:19,280
you know, Lockheed works directly with the Air Force. I just, I don't really understand

1238
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:26,400
like this, where the CIA, basically, I don't know where the CIA and the Air Force split,

1239
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,920
because it seems like that's part of this story. Yeah, it seems like, yeah, especially

1240
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,400
where's the difference, because there's a lot of joint teams in JSOC that can operate under

1241
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:42,800
CIA's directive or any sort of directive. And the Air Force has quite a few teams, 24th STS,

1242
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:49,440
the old classic blue berets and so forth. The Air Force is very interesting, but so is the,

1243
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:54,800
also the naval involvement as well as outlined by Chris Sharp. Yeah, right. In his recent article,

1244
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:00,480
I think he, after his third edit, because I think there was some trouble with Dean, Dean Johnson.

1245
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:06,000
Yeah, but I try to extend an apology to him because I had talked about

1246
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,760
the original edit that Sunday before any of that drama came out. So I felt bad if I had

1247
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,760
implicated him in anything bad like the threats he said. Yeah, I'm confused though. I wasn't

1248
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,960
paying enough attention. What happened with all that? So September 20th is when the article

1249
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,560
is released. September 22nd, I did a live and I remember I had read the article when it first

1250
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:34,800
the second it came out. And I was gobsmacked to see mention of the National Underwater Reconnaissance

1251
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:44,640
Office of CIA, Office of Science and Technology, NRO, NGA, Lockheed Martin, and Woodsville Ocean

1252
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:51,120
ographic Institute. And come the 22nd, that had been edited out. So thankful to the Wayback

1253
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,440
Machine, I was able to talk about the original version of that article. And then that week on

1254
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:00,080
Twitter, Dean, Dean Johnson, I guess, called Chris Sharp out or something. And Chris Sharp

1255
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:05,920
stated that he had received threats due to the original article. So he re-edited everything

1256
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:11,360
out there and basically expanded on the fact or not fact, but the allegations that Woods Hole,

1257
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:17,360
in accordance to kind of NRO, the underwater reconnaissance office, will retrieve craft

1258
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,760
due to their very unique submersibles and then pass them on to the Office of Naval Research

1259
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:27,920
for testing alongside defense contractors. Yeah, okay. Just another thing.

1260
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,640
Yeah, because I feel like for so long, the Navy's been overlooked in terms of

1261
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:42,160
but going back to the nexus of like Air Force Regulation 200-2 and JANAP-146C in which the

1262
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:48,000
USAF kind of restricted UFO reporting methods and like incurred a $10,000 fine if commercial

1263
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,680
pilots reported UFOs, the Navy did the same thing with OPMAV 3820. So the Navy was right there with

1264
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:58,320
the Air Force back in the heyday of kind of restricting UFO reporting. Gotcha. Okay.

1265
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:05,120
This is so bonkers. And then of course, there's corporations that tie into every single piece

1266
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:11,920
of this, whether that's the Lockheed-Norton, SAIC, EG&G. Right, right. And I think, I mean,

1267
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,640
that's the way we've all are in our little chat. Yeah, kind of been joking about it too, is just

1268
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:24,160
like, well, it makes sense. I mean, all of this makes sense now. I think half jokingly to sort of

1269
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:33,280
talk about a lot of this is being almost biblical in a general sense. There are these revelations

1270
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:39,680
coming out and there's so much at play all at the same time. You know what I mean? It's like we've

1271
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:48,000
got the craziest political upheaval we've ever had. We've got climate crisis. We just watched

1272
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:56,240
the crazy flooding yesterday on the East Coast. Just so much income inequality and disparity

1273
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:02,400
and all these things and all these reckonings happening on a cultural level and socioeconomic

1274
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:11,840
level while all of this stuff is happening as well. And it's almost like, yeah, the whole,

1275
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:17,200
it's like this entire system has been built up. And this is like when it all kind of comes down.

1276
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:24,320
This is the house of cards, basically. And so even to talk strictly about all the different

1277
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:30,960
contractors, it's like this whole thing is so unwieldy. And like the way Dana Solika talked

1278
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:37,600
about the Fight Club, it's like that thing's making more sense now. Just all these people

1279
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:45,920
have it. Yeah, the picture of corporations involved in contractors as well as USG specific

1280
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,880
three-letter agencies and USG military branches that are involved is starting to become a bit

1281
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:58,400
clear. And it's been very fascinating to follow these revelations and see how a JSOC, OGA,

1282
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:06,800
ONR, NRO, NRO, NGA and so forth has implicated. It's so interesting. I wonder if the magenta craft,

1283
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,040
if it where it's being housed now, if there's still sort of efforts being done on it or it's

1284
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:18,160
just kind of catalogued away and like an Indiana Jones relic warehouse. Yeah, I mean,

1285
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,080
what was Birchhead's joke? Like every time you name them, the whole truck shows up.

1286
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:30,160
It takes stuff away. Yeah, yeah. I mean, my best guess is that initially,

1287
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:38,880
it might have been taken to Oak Ridge, you know, because, you know, Vannevar Bush gets the memo

1288
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:45,680
from, I think from FDR, from Marshall. I forget. There's some of the three of them are talking,

1289
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:50,720
basically, you know, so he gets to setting up Oak Ridge, you know, and this is also following

1290
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:58,960
the Cape Girardeau incident. So, you know, if they had everything, at that time at least, you know,

1291
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,800
had everything in one place because there was no Edwards Air Force base or anything,

1292
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:09,200
who knows now or any of this stuff is, you know. And I found it interesting in later cases,

1293
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:14,400
especially in the 60s and the 70s, how often mention is made of kind of rotating warehouses of

1294
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:20,160
where craft are stored. One perfect example is Kecksburg that is supposedly taken to Lockburn

1295
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,800
Air Force Base in Ohio first and then shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. There's also

1296
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:30,720
the testimony of an anonymous witness RB in Stringfield's files that talked about guarding a craft

1297
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:35,280
about three hours outside of a base in South Carolina and that every two weeks, three weeks,

1298
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:43,920
it would be rotated through. Oh, really? And also, in a project I'm covering now, there's stories of

1299
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:49,680
reverse engineering testing team that's rotated through every six months for program security.

1300
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:53,840
So, possibly not only are materials transferred around and shipped around, but personnel are

1301
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:59,760
too. But is that kind of an old method or is that still ongoing? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know

1302
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:06,320
about sight of things at all. I haven't heard any of that stuff. But it's just, what do you have

1303
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:11,360
next for your research? Where do you plan on going next? I don't know. I have to like,

1304
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,680
yeah, I have to figure out personal stuff. I fit so down this rabbit hole.

1305
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,520
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I've been looking into like the death ray stuff, which is

1306
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,440
really interesting. And, you know, Marconi playing around with that stuff and Tesla playing around

1307
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:38,160
with that stuff. And, you know, John Trump, you know, Donald Trump's uncle, who is basically given all

1308
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:52,000
of Tesla's files after he dies. And at the same time, he was in like the x-ray business. And then

1309
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:59,600
I think when it was announced we were going to World War II, he got into radar. And so it's funny

1310
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:07,280
that he's the one who's given Tesla's documents, you know, Tesla was also like, if radar came from

1311
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:13,520
the death ray, and that's what John Trump specifically was also working on, was radar stuff.

1312
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:19,280
But, you know, even the way like, if you watch like Simon Hollis, you know, that's kind of where I

1313
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:26,080
sort of started locking onto that, you know, that like we understood more about radar early on

1314
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:33,280
than we let anybody know that it was all derived from an F-ray. And it basically was like an EMP

1315
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:40,320
early on. So, and then it makes sense that it's, you know, partly responsible for a lot of these

1316
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,640
crashes early on as well, you know. Yeah, there's early stories, especially with Roswell, that's

1317
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:52,960
some sort of radar interference, kind of a mess with a craft's inner circuitry or however the craft

1318
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:59,200
are powered. That's an awesome rabbit hole. Oh, yeah, that's fun. Yeah. I mean, I was watching the,

1319
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:05,280
I don't know if you saw the Falcon crew guys who got the part of the arts parts

1320
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:11,440
a couple months ago, and we're testing it. Oh, they've done material, they've been

1321
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:16,400
doing material analysis. A little bit, yeah, and they were super public right away, you know,

1322
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,560
they were live streaming at all. But, yeah, they got a little bit of it anonymously,

1323
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:27,040
and, or by a source who wanted to stay anonymous. And, yeah, I just happened to catch it that day,

1324
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:31,440
and they were looking at it, and it matches up with so much other stuff that a lot of us have heard

1325
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:38,960
about, like the terrorist waveguide stuff, and how it basically acts as a superconductor, and,

1326
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:47,120
and it looks, it would make sense, you know, if it's like 3D printed material, and there's like a

1327
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:54,640
lattice honeycomb structure inside of it. So it makes sense if like the power gets transferred

1328
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:02,560
up, it's like this really, like beautiful way, basically, that, you know, the whole thing gets

1329
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:10,160
powered. And, yeah, it's pretty wild. I mean, I had, I had a sighting once that kind of lines up

1330
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:16,160
with some of that stuff. Oh, would you see? I've had a few, but this was the closest one,

1331
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:24,240
this was back in January, not far from my house. Yeah, I saw two, I'm assuming it was two,

1332
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:30,560
they were in the clouds, and so I didn't see any like structure, but I basically just saw the

1333
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:38,960
underside of like the, I'm guessing, like electromagnetic waves that were powering these

1334
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:44,320
things, you know, and one was like this beautiful amber, and one was this beautiful violet, and

1335
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:51,280
they were really close together, moving really slow, like, wow, do they have any like change in

1336
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:57,840
direction? Could you see kind of a shape of a craft? I mean, they were saucer shaped,

1337
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:05,360
but I didn't see any like hard craft surfaces or anything. They were like, yeah, just inside the

1338
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:11,360
clouds, and I was like coming in from hanging out in my backyard and looked up, and right there,

1339
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:16,160
things moved really slow, and I kind of waved and said hi, and they took off into the clouds

1340
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,400
real slow, and I was like, okay. Interesting, now you said you could see kind of like an

1341
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,800
electromagnetic discharge, what you, you could see kind of a visible wave pattern?

1342
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:32,000
Yeah, there's a, I can't mean to find these and save them, there's two images I've seen, one is of a,

1343
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:40,240
one went around a month or two ago, it's like a coin, I forget from where, but one side is like

1344
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:46,720
of a craft, and then the other side is like a straight up reptilian, like smiling or something,

1345
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:54,800
and there's another image from, like this famous historical image from Italy, from Rome or something,

1346
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:01,840
that's very similar to where the craft, it's like these grooves on the bottom, and so it kind of like,

1347
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:10,000
if you can imagine, like let's say, eight or ten grooves on the bottom, and it's kind of like each

1348
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,400
one had its own like energy field. Interesting. So all I could see was the energy basically.

1349
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:23,040
Kind of like of a saucer shape? Yeah, yeah, it was, yeah it was beautiful, yeah, it was wild.

1350
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:30,000
That sounds fascinating. And it was, I mean, yeah, and it was, I was having like a particularly bad

1351
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,120
night too, so it was kind of funny when you talk about the psychic connection, whatever all of that

1352
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:41,680
means, you know, it was kind of like, yeah, I was having a rough one, and it just, it was like,

1353
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:48,800
came out from under my carport, and it looked up, and they were just right there. Wow. Okay, thanks.

1354
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:55,200
That is incredible. And I went back in and kept playing video games, yeah. Whatever, geez.

1355
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:02,080
Voler, I'll let you, I'll let you go now. I got a 20 minutes until a hard stop, and I usually do a

1356
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:09,760
tiny bit of a Q&A right before, but real fast, where can you run through part eight real quick?

1357
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:17,600
Yes, please, yes. Okay, so apparently the story of a Stargate was going around in the 1920s

1358
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:23,200
in Iraq, and a lot of the world's rich and elite were kind of obsessed with it.

1359
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:30,080
Apparently, some of this isn't in there, apparently who Saddam Hussein found it in like the late 80s.

1360
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,680
And so when we went to war in 90, that's a big part of what they were looking for,

1361
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:43,840
Bush and Cheney. And I guess Cheney was like obsessed with the idea of a Stargate, you know,

1362
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,040
and this like ultimate power and time and space and all this weird stuff.

1363
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:53,200
Some people have reached out to me to say that like when we invaded in 2003,

1364
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,600
that was specifically, they were looking for that. And I think that's what they found,

1365
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:03,680
purportedly, what they found in this tomb of Gilgamesh is this Stargate. And there was a story

1366
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:14,080
too of, I think Russian officers in like 91 saw the US shoot down a UFO in Iraq.

1367
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:15,680
Interesting.

1368
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:25,440
Yeah, so basically, yeah, it looks like that's possible. Stargate, UFO, whatever. I mean,

1369
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,440
there's this J-Rod story in the Stargate and all of that. So, yeah.

1370
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:33,840
In part nine, we might see a further investigation into the Stargate because I

1371
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,080
find that absolutely fascinating. I have a very amateur level of knowledge here.

1372
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:46,000
So, it's just keeps getting crazier. So, we got part nine to look forward to and

1373
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,600
the documentary you're starting to work on for Magenta.

1374
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,400
That's new documentary. Yeah, definitely some stuff about the death ray x-ray or death ray

1375
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,760
radar stuff. I don't know. I haven't really thought it out too much.

1376
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:03,920
So, where, so Reddit and Medium under voller records, where else could we find you?

1377
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:12,960
I started it about a year ago, losing my mind after Grush. And then my Reddit posts were getting too

1378
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,240
long. Oh, wait, I think I lost, yeah. Where'd you go?

1379
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:30,400
Oh, sorry. What was I looking for? Oh, my Medium is Escape Velocity.

1380
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:37,600
Escape Velocity. Okay, I have that in your Reddit posts in the video description.

1381
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:43,680
Okay, awesome. Cool. I know that we kind of glossed over some of the details, but I highly

1382
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,000
recommend reading every single part one through eight and clicking through the links because

1383
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,920
in every single piece you've made, you have linked a tremendous amount of third party research and

1384
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:59,360
other avenues to go down. And that is my favorite thing about this research that nothing is just a

1385
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:04,160
you saying, okay, here's an executive summary. It's the entire body of research with clickable

1386
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,760
links. And people still complain. So whatever. I mean, I don't care anymore.

1387
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:14,480
You can never have 100. It's too many links. Hey, man, you know how many times I get people

1388
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:19,680
calling me out of my videos for not pronouncing words, right? There will always be some level

1389
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:24,400
of dissatisfaction. As long as you're putting together a cohesive thesis with supporting links

1390
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:29,440
and an argument, I think you're doing a fantastic job. And these eight pieces I have learned so

1391
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:36,800
much from. I think they're amazing. Cool. Yeah, lost my mind. Trying to get it back now.

1392
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,720
All right, Voler, well, I will catch up with you privately, my man. And thank you so much for

1393
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:45,680
coming on the show. Once I wrap this up at here, six PM my time, I'll shoot you a text and we'll

1394
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:52,160
talk a little bit more. Thank you so much, brother. I appreciate it. All right. Bye, brother.

1395
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:58,560
Yeah. Okay, guys, we're going to do 15 minutes of Q&A while I get Voler signed off here.

1396
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,760
Everybody, please thank Voler for coming on the show. He's done a tremendous eight parts.

1397
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:09,600
It's incredibly difficult to try and talk about all eight parts he's done because this is like a

1398
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:16,080
massive body of research. So check out all eight parts. We're going to do 15 minutes until I got

1399
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:21,280
to get off of Q&A. Because you know, I love to do that at the end. If you guys will give me one

1400
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:25,680
second, I'm just going to run to the restroom, put some questions up and I will get to them in

1401
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:37,200
like two seconds. All right, give me less than a minute. I'll be right back.

1402
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,740
You

1403
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:33,120
know, okay, guys, I am back. So let's let's start going through some questions.

1404
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,400
One of my boys texted me said there was a little bit of quarrel going on in the chat. So if somebody

1405
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:45,760
wants to enlighten me as to what was going on, let me know. Also, I just find the connection

1406
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,800
of the entire Bush family to the legacy programs fascinating. I think this is an avenue that

1407
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:56,720
should continue to be explored and I cannot wait. So I did miss a couple super chats,

1408
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:01,680
too close, two cents, fat rodents, Ort Wiener. Thank you guys so much for donating. I so

1409
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:05,520
appreciated it. I didn't get a chance to look at the chat during the conversation with Volare

1410
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:10,560
Records, but I appreciate him coming on the show so very much. I think those eight pieces are

1411
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,440
fantastic. And I hope he makes a documentary on Magenta. Let's start with Big Dog. Yeah,

1412
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:21,440
the Bush research is fantastic all the way from the Magenta crash to OSS to big oil companies

1413
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:28,800
and so forth. So we'll start going through these. Zach, what's up, brother? Where do you draw your

1414
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,280
line? Is open landing and contact in a military base too much fixed point out? It's like the same

1415
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:43,120
time and location as Sakura. I'm not sure, especially in terms of the Holloman and Edwards

1416
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:48,880
Air Force Base landing. It seems like a almost one off occurrence as far as we know of Fox,

1417
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:53,520
not Fitz. Okay, okay, I see. Fox points out it's like the same time and location as Sakura.

1418
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:58,160
I still find it strange, especially the Holloman Air Force Base landing is almost an isolated

1419
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,920
incident in which beans outright present themselves. However, there is one more story

1420
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,240
of that I'm going to cover up in my next video at an Air Force Base of some beans who almost

1421
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,320
willingly walk out of their craft and give it up. It's a story in one of Leonard Stringfield's

1422
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:15,120
crash retrievals. It's very interesting, so I can't wait to cover that. So let's see.

1423
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:22,000
Okay, you guys must be chatting about some in here. Let me know what you guys have been

1424
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,080
talking about. Have I watched the X Files mythology episode? Highly recommend no, but I've

1425
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:31,280
wanted to get into X Files, especially a couple cool people in my discord have been talking about

1426
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:36,800
X Files and one of the creators I think Frost and how X Files may have had a little bit of

1427
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:42,320
interesting inside tidbits in terms of this, in terms of their research. So

1428
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:50,240
what's your opinion on Daniel Salter and the Accio? I do not know what the Accio is. So if ACIO,

1429
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:54,000
I don't know if it's an acronym, so please fill me in so I can do some research.

1430
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:00,480
Have you had a chance to look at Larry Reed from Lockheed? You should try and get an interview

1431
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:05,680
with him. No, I have not. I still want to get, I'm still trying to get in, not contact, but a

1432
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:12,800
little more information on Dr. Jim Ryder as well. But Larry Reed is up there. Did I accidentally say

1433
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:19,600
cover up? I don't know. Did I? I don't think I did. I need to fix the spectacles. If I said

1434
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:24,720
cover up, let me know how I said it. The Iraq Gilgameshian Bible and buried UAP rabbit hole,

1435
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:29,680
it's wild. I need to read the whole part eight because the tomb of Gilgameshian Iraq and the

1436
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:35,040
possible embassy being built in that region because of some sort of UAP technology or tech as well

1437
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:39,920
as Dick Cheney is really interesting. I'm such a novice here. That's why I was so excited when

1438
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,800
Voler texted me today and said that he had this part eight out on Stargate. It's wonderful.

1439
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,120
Mentioned of X-Files and Twin Peaks, I think the same Frost, the showwriter worked on both.

1440
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,880
Let's see. Let's see. Everybody's loving Stargate is...

1441
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:02,560
Okay, let's see. Sounds like you and Voler need to get together with some of the connections you

1442
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,400
both talked about. I'm going to make him a chart of his names and dates and overlaps.

1443
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:13,120
You made him something. I'd love to see that. That's awesome. I would love to work with Voler,

1444
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:23,440
Kermit, Senior Trader, 3942, a lot of guys on a joint project because there are some amazing

1445
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:28,480
researchers out there that the bulk majority of their work has been put out on Reddit. If I can

1446
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,240
help it, I'll use the platform to let some of them come on and talk about their research like

1447
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:39,280
Voler. I think it's fantastic. Fringe is better than X-Files. I've never seen Fringe, so maybe I

1448
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:48,000
will have to watch that. Let's keep going through. Leave the Bill Herman abduction. Maybe some new

1449
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:54,640
interesting abduction stuff coming up soon, guys. I've heard Stargate is a very good show,

1450
01:46:54,640 --> 01:47:00,560
the original. I recently made an executive decision. I was between that and Battlestar Galactica,

1451
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,960
the early 2000s show. I decided to go with Battlestar, so maybe I'll do Stargate next.

1452
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:14,160
The first season of X-Files was based on RealPerson's FBI case, John Sousa. That sounds somewhat

1453
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:20,400
familiar, but my recollection is failing me, so I need to do some extra research there.

1454
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:29,440
Okay. I would love to team up with Jesse Michaels and Danny Jones. We'll see about Jesse. We never

1455
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:34,800
got to get together when he was here in Colorado. Just got to be a little bit too big, but he and

1456
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:40,560
I chat often, so there should be some more time soon coming up that we can link up.

1457
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:46,400
Sorry. Cheney must have met with analysts at CIA's WinPack many times leading up to the

1458
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:52,240
invasion of Iraq, probably. Yeah, absolutely. I still find it so interesting that,

1459
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:57,520
according to Voller's research, Cheney might have had a vested interest in some exotic technologies

1460
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:05,120
that Iraq. Okay, let's see. After reading through Voller's posts and watching your vids,

1461
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:09,520
is there any area you recommend someone to look into, something that is often overlooked?

1462
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,400
Patterns with bodies associated with crash retrievals. I think a lot of the time with

1463
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,720
crash retrievals, I talk about this a lot, people are afraid to go into the territory of bodies

1464
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:24,560
because it's so contentious, and a lot of people look at it with such ridicule, but bodies are

1465
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:30,480
one of the most fascinating and unexplored aspects of retrieval operations. Santiago,

1466
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:36,080
have I ever played Halo? Dude, is that even a question? Halo reaches my ultimate gaming experience

1467
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:43,440
I've ever had. I know Halo 3 is probably considered the greatest Halo game, but I will continue to

1468
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:51,040
preach that Halo reach was the pinnacle of gaming. I loved that game. Okay, so the ACIO

1469
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:58,080
Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization. No, I need to look into that more. Is the

1470
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:03,360
Looking Glass located at S4? Yes, Mr. Mozilla. According to Dan Burish and a couple other

1471
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:09,280
alleged sources, Project Looking Glass is located at area S4. According to the design specs by

1472
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:15,680
Dan Burish, S4 has five levels, with the lowest level housing J-Rod level, the level above being

1473
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:22,000
like a crew quarter for testing the level above housing Project Looking Glass. Still, I get asked

1474
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,600
this all the time when I look into Dan Burish. Probably at some point, but I got a lot of other

1475
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:33,680
stuff first. The Looking Glass is pretty interesting, and there is a whole PDF. It's like a book.

1476
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:38,160
It's called Project Aquarius that focuses on Dan Burish's claims in Looking Glass. I highly

1477
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:42,080
recommend looking at that. I'll post a link to it in the Discord.

1478
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:50,080
I do remember Reach. Reach is fantastic. The final mission, Survive, is that can bring a tear

1479
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:55,520
to any man's eyes. Did you know the CIA trains psychic spies to build mental protective barriers

1480
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:00,400
around CIA facilities to prevent remote viewers from spying? Yes, I did. I've heard about that.

1481
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:05,040
I don't know specific instances, specifics, or specific individuals, but I have heard of that.

1482
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,320
The CIA and private companies research into psionics and psychic powers remote viewing is

1483
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:20,640
something that fascinates me greatly. Could reported classified alien religious documents

1484
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:24,800
be declared constitutional violation of freedom to practice religion by the Supreme Court forcing

1485
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:32,240
disclosure? That is assuming that classified alien religious documents exist, which I think

1486
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:43,040
that is alleged by Bob Lazar and the Reddit biologist. I think the two people who have

1487
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:48,080
commented on that, if such documents exist, I think that would bring a lot of really interesting

1488
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:57,680
questions on theology. Can you please never say scintillating again? I'm sorry, I just did.

1489
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,800
But I'll try to. The word scintillating is great.

1490
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,080
So something or someone says, I wouldn't say remote viewing is real. I remain

1491
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:11,200
unconvinced. Okay, so you're talking about remote viewing. Yeah, I would also like to

1492
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:18,080
see demonstrations of remote viewing. Very interested in it. Have I come across a lab

1493
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:25,760
laboratory in Italy in my research? I have never, but that might be something I'll

1494
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,920
pull over to a voler to look into in conjunction with the magenta case.

1495
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,560
Scintillating. Okay, guys, at this point, you know that there are many words that I pronounce

1496
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:44,080
absolutely horribly in the videos I go through and try to make sure I pronounce everything

1497
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:50,480
correctly, but I will miss stuff. I just can't speak too well. That being said, the new video

1498
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:55,840
should be here tomorrow or Tuesday. I'm thinking Tuesday to put some extra time into it.

1499
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:04,640
I really think you guys are going to enjoy this video. It is another primary investigation with

1500
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:10,240
a ton of research put into it. The video I would liken it most to is the Off-World Technologies

1501
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:17,840
Division. There are some pretty surprising research avenues here, so keep an eye out for that.

1502
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:24,240
I'm not going to spoil the name or the subject of it. After that, we have another really cool

1503
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:30,240
crash retrieval. Fire away the questions, guys. We've got a couple more minutes. If anybody's

1504
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:36,400
got any more questions, maybe I'll give another hint to the next video. I guess I kind of

1505
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:43,520
disclosed something. It involves mention of various Air Force bases such as Nellis. That's

1506
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,280
going to be a cool one. I appreciate that, Hayden Pierce, even if I'm mispronouncing stuff. This one

1507
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:56,880
involves the possibility of reverse engineering in various Air Force bases, most notably Nellis.

1508
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:03,840
There was a reason that I talked about the U2 with Nellis and testing there at Area 51.

1509
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,880
Area 51 is just northwest of Nellis at the Nevada Test and Training Range.

1510
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:17,520
I think in the comments, some of you guys are talking about not trusting Elizondo.

1511
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,200
What have been some of the arguments for and against Elizondo in the chat?

1512
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:30,160
If you guys are talking about Elizondo, I'd like to see some of these.

1513
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:38,000
A little bit of discourse in the chat. You guys, let me know what's going on.

1514
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:44,960
I appreciate that, big dog. There's so many topics in this space that aren't covered

1515
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:53,600
necessarily to a wide extent. As we see with Volor Records, research that even analyzing

1516
01:53:53,600 --> 01:54:00,320
just a small case or an individual in their connection to UAP requires a tremendous amount

1517
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:11,520
of research and diving into. You haven't checked the Scott Castle USO story. Guy says he has footage

1518
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:17,520
somewhere of a USO. I'd be very interested to see that. I'd like to put some more time into USO

1519
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:24,640
research, especially with the implication of Woods Hole, Neuro, O&R, and so forth. If there's any USO

1520
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:30,800
videos, I would like to see those. The only USO related video I've seen was a Reddit post of

1521
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:35,760
just some anomalous lights under some water. This photo occurred at night. I'm sure you guys

1522
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:44,080
know what I'm talking about and have seen that. Guy says he has footage somewhere, a tail has

1523
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:50,960
as old as time. With many cases, there will be alleged footage. That's why stuff like

1524
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:55,920
Holloman and the Edwards Air Force Base is a bit frustrating because even though somebody like

1525
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,920
Gordon Cooper and accomplished Mercury astronaut will say that footage exists,

1526
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:05,520
there's still no way to get our hands on such footage. Throughout Crash Retrieval's Parts 1-7

1527
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:11,200
from Leonard Stringfield, there is also much discussion of a supposed alien autopsy as well,

1528
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:15,440
some sort of lost footage. I think there was a NASA astronaut recently who mentioned seeing

1529
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:24,480
some sort of NHI video as well. Were you talking about the story where a guy from the retrieval

1530
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:28,800
team asked a bunch of languages but the beans are just catatonic and walk right off the craft?

1531
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:32,720
Can I get the Stringfield PDF too? Yes, I will post that. No, those are two different things.

1532
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:37,840
The bunch of languages is the infographics whistleblower who talks about the head doctor who

1533
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:43,840
is fluent in Russian, English, Chinese, and other languages. He references some cases where the

1534
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:51,200
beans found are almost children that can be led by pointing. This is a small story. It's a small

1535
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:56,800
excerpt in Leonard Stringfield. I think it's Part 9 of Crash Retrieval's Part 6. Sorry,

1536
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:01,440
there's a bunch of parts in it. I only make mention of this because it is of important

1537
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:06,560
contextual relevance to my case. I will tell you exactly where it is, Zach. Are you in the discord?

1538
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:14,400
I'll post it there. Could there be a connection between UFO and the gremlins at the RAF?

1539
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:22,400
The RAF Royal Air Force claims would cause trouble for them. Quite possibly. I'm not too familiar

1540
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,160
with the claims of RAF and the gremlins. That might be something I have to look into a little bit.

1541
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:34,240
Space Geek says, thank you for all your hard work. You have the most well-researched videos.

1542
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:37,760
I truly believe once the YouTube algorithm finds you, you'll have millions of subs very soon.

1543
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:43,840
Thank you, ma'am. That'd be cool. I don't even know how to deal with 10,000 subs, let alone a

1544
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,560
million. Boy, that would be a dream. I'm going to post the Discord link one more time, guys,

1545
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:55,200
because Zach wants to hop in. Hop in the Discord if you want to chat about UAP during the day,

1546
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,720
talk about anything. There's some really sharp researchers in there, too. Really sharp guys.

1547
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:08,240
Zach just posted, Anthony, good show. Interesting links about EGNG, Carlisle,

1548
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:11,120
and various players. Thank you. I very much appreciate that. You have a story of Eric

1549
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:16,160
Tabor, especially with EGNG. Area 51 is really interesting, especially how it ties into the

1550
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:20,640
donation craft theory. That patch, there was a lot of controversy around that, because I think

1551
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:25,440
Eric Tabor didn't think much about it initially, so he tried to pawn it off on eBay. That's why

1552
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:29,760
there was a bit of steam when Ross Colthart posted the patch initially in his presentation,

1553
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:36,160
and then it images surfaced of it up on eBay. That got a little hairy at one point,

1554
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:40,480
but that's a great story. Of course, Eric Tabor is a second, if not a third-hand whistleblower,

1555
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,960
but still him talking to Arrow is still of consequence, and I still find that

1556
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,800
extremely interesting and worth paying attention to.

1557
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,520
You're talking about Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl talking about Gremlins. No, that's interesting,

1558
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,640
but as a child, I loved Roald Dahl's work, especially the BIG. I'd like to check that out.

1559
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:07,120
Okay, what are you guys? We'll answer a handful more, guys, and then we shall sign off, so I can

1560
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:11,680
also post some of those documents and so forth in the Discord. If there's anything I forget to post,

1561
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:18,480
please just let me know. My mind's going a couple miles or miles a minute when we talk, so there's

1562
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,720
some stuff I might forget, but I know I need to post for you, Zach, that specific excerpt of

1563
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:28,240
Crash Retrieval's Part 1 through 7. I'll just post the full thing, and I'd love to talk a little

1564
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:32,880
bit about Michael Schratz diving into Leonard Stringfield's work, so that's another one I'd

1565
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:38,800
like to look into. Guys, if there are no more questions, okay, okay, upcoming vids you are

1566
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:43,440
working on, any tees? Yes, I just did tease the new video that should come out Monday or Tuesday.

1567
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:49,200
I will say one word, or I guess two words, and that is reverse engineering,

1568
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:55,920
and I guess another couple of words, I will say Air Force Base, and this video has been

1569
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:01,360
a blast to work on just as much as the Off-World Technologies Division. That's the sort of video

1570
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:07,440
I would like in it, too. Big dog, thank you so much. Thank you. I really appreciate the support,

1571
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:15,040
as always, man. And if you guys are arguing about Elizondo, Yuri Geller, how did he get

1572
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:18,560
brought up, and other people do, I'd love to see it in the Discord or bring up the arguments. I'd

1573
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:23,040
love to see what you guys are talking about, but with that, my friends, we shall sign off for the

1574
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:28,160
day, and I really appreciate everybody joining. Thank you so much. The video should be out Monday

1575
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:34,960
or Tuesday, and we will have a next stream on Sunday and possibly a couple other things coming

1576
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:39,520
out in between then. But thank you all so much for joining, and I will catch everybody on the next show.
