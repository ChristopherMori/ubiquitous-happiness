WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:03.200
Okay, let's see.

00:03.200 --> 00:06.200
I think we should be live at this time.

00:06.200 --> 00:10.240
If anybody can hear us in the comments, let us know.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.120
I'm here with Voler Records.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.680
Let's see, this should update the number of viewers

00:16.680 --> 00:17.520
in just one second.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.520
Sometimes it's a little laggy.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.640
Okay, cool.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.320
It looks like we're starting off with 40 people.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.400
If anybody can hear me in the chat, please let me know.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.000
And then we will cut to the chase

00:27.000 --> 00:29.640
because we have quite a bit to talk about today,

00:29.640 --> 00:31.760
quite a bit of really interesting stuff.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.120
Okay, cool.

00:34.120 --> 00:34.960
All right, what's up?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.040
See, Britt and I see you.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.640
So guys, I'm here with Voler Records.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.040
A lot of you probably have heard of some of his work.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.440
I wanted to kind of link up and speak to him today.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.280
Let me just pull up what he's been working on a little bit

00:48.280 --> 00:51.880
so we can kind of get a little bit of baseline

00:51.880 --> 00:53.480
for what we're gonna talk about.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.720
So Voler Records recently, I would say,

00:58.720 --> 01:00.600
when did you start this, about August?

01:01.920 --> 01:03.560
About three weeks ago.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.360
Okay, he has put out an eight-part series now

01:06.360 --> 01:09.160
at this point that covers the relationship

01:09.160 --> 01:13.160
between UAP Legacy Programs, the Bush family,

01:13.160 --> 01:17.520
the 1933 Magenta Case, Dick Cheney, companies like EG&G

01:17.520 --> 01:20.520
and the Carlisle Group, including a part eight

01:20.520 --> 01:21.880
that just recently came out.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.240
I haven't got a chance to read that yet,

01:23.240 --> 01:25.120
so we'll talk about that today.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.000
But the sort of the amount of research here

01:28.000 --> 01:30.680
and the quality of the posting is just so fantastic.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.800
I know he's worked closely with a lot of other people

01:32.800 --> 01:35.520
I've talked to, such as C. Britton in the chat,

01:35.520 --> 01:40.040
363942, Max Parr, Kermit, all fantastic researchers.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.320
So Voler, if you'd like to introduce yourself a little bit

01:43.320 --> 01:44.920
and kind of tell us a little bit

01:44.920 --> 01:47.240
how you got into investigating the phenomenon

01:47.240 --> 01:50.200
and then how you said that all the talk of Dick Cheney

01:50.200 --> 01:52.360
being at the top of the UFO pyramid inspired you.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.960
I'd like to hear how you got into this subject

01:54.960 --> 01:56.840
in this specific research project.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.240
Sure, like a lot of folks been into this stuff

02:02.240 --> 02:05.240
since I was a kid, kind of terrified and fascinated

02:05.240 --> 02:09.200
at the same time, was buying books.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.320
I just turned 44, so I was of an age where it was like

02:12.320 --> 02:16.560
right when, unsolved mysteries and sightings

02:16.560 --> 02:18.000
and all the shows were coming out

02:18.000 --> 02:19.880
and growing up an 80s kid.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.920
Yeah, and I was buying books.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.600
I had a little section on my bookshelf

02:24.600 --> 02:26.480
of like UFO cases and stuff.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.400
And yeah, I never really lost interest

02:33.400 --> 02:38.400
but it kind of came and went in terms of intensity

02:38.560 --> 02:43.320
and yeah, we were talking right before we went live.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.320
I think in 2004, there was the famous case

02:48.320 --> 02:51.360
of the Mexican pilots, I'm pretty sure it was Mexico.

02:52.120 --> 02:57.120
And it's like the seven lights, craft, whatever

02:57.360 --> 03:00.400
that they see and that was a pretty big deal.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.880
And I think that was about the time that YouTube hit.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.040
And so that went pretty viral, you know,

03:07.040 --> 03:10.320
until the point that, you know, it was like Mexico

03:10.320 --> 03:12.560
and Venezuela and a few other central

03:12.560 --> 03:14.320
and South American countries.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.040
And I know it was Sweden and I don't remember who else

03:18.040 --> 03:19.240
but, you know, there was an attempt

03:19.280 --> 03:21.920
to building this kind of international coalition

03:21.920 --> 03:24.200
for transparency, you know, and of course,

03:24.200 --> 03:27.600
the United States didn't wanna have anything to do with it.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.360
And then, yeah, I mean, cut to 2017,

03:33.360 --> 03:34.840
we all know what happened there, you know,

03:34.840 --> 03:36.160
it was such a huge thing.

03:38.360 --> 03:43.360
And then in 2020, you know, with really nothing to do,

03:44.360 --> 03:49.440
you know, I was pretty involved with the protests and stuff.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.240
And I think once a lot of that started quieting down

03:54.640 --> 03:58.000
in the fall, I was just all in on this

03:58.000 --> 04:00.400
because everything else was so messed up, you know,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.120
it was just kind of like, okay,

04:02.120 --> 04:04.560
like we're in a pretty bad spot, you know,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.240
kind of all around.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.240
And so yeah, just a lot of my free time was spent,

04:11.760 --> 04:14.360
you know, watching stuff and listening to podcasts

04:14.360 --> 04:19.280
and just kind of soaking things in and, you know,

04:19.280 --> 04:20.600
we'll talk more about this,

04:20.600 --> 04:22.760
but I think a lot of this has been about, you know,

04:22.760 --> 04:25.360
normalizing a lot of this stuff.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.600
Yeah, I know we were talking about it a little bit

04:27.600 --> 04:30.240
and it's something that's featured heavily in your research,

04:30.240 --> 04:32.800
is kind of calling back to statements Grush has made,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.480
whether on his news nation appearance,

04:34.480 --> 04:36.200
whether at his congressional hearings.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.720
And it sounds like Grush was like a massive influence

04:38.720 --> 04:39.760
for a lot of your work.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.960
And would you say that, especially in July of 2023

04:42.960 --> 04:45.320
with Grush on news nation, the Senate hearings,

04:45.320 --> 04:49.760
that kind of kickstarted you to research this in depth

04:49.760 --> 04:50.800
into a subject?

04:51.880 --> 04:54.720
Yeah, I mean, I would say I was already there,

04:54.720 --> 04:58.960
but definitely, I mean, that changed everything.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.800
Right.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.840
That was such a huge deal.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.840
I mean, Elizondo was a big enough deal.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.320
But yeah, Grush, I mean, Grush spun me out.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.760
You know, I remember I had a whole,

05:08.760 --> 05:11.080
the whole next day I was just like,

05:11.080 --> 05:14.080
in a weird haze almost, you know?

05:14.080 --> 05:19.080
And it was funny because I kept thinking

05:19.560 --> 05:22.680
things were gonna change right away, you know?

05:22.680 --> 05:25.000
And we're still here.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.080
I mean, the lots happened, but you know, I think

05:29.080 --> 05:32.880
so much of this has been about learning, you know,

05:32.880 --> 05:37.040
kind of the way Matthew Pines has been talking about it.

05:37.080 --> 05:41.400
You know, this sort of word of mouth desensitization

05:41.400 --> 05:44.200
and normalization and, you know, you can still kind of

05:44.200 --> 05:47.520
go about your day and, you know, I think

05:48.840 --> 05:52.960
because of the fluid nature of media now

05:52.960 --> 05:55.040
and the way that we consume it,

05:55.040 --> 05:57.920
you can very easily see some crazy UFO video

05:57.920 --> 06:00.040
and then keep scrolling Twitter or whatever,

06:00.040 --> 06:00.880
you know what I mean?

06:00.880 --> 06:03.560
And you're just like, oh, okay, that's pretty nuts.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.480
And then kind of move on, you know, to a degree.

06:09.560 --> 06:14.160
But yeah, I mean, I think, I'm not really sure.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.960
I'll say it was around, we were talking about this,

06:15.960 --> 06:18.000
but, you know, before we started recording,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.160
but I think it was around December

06:22.160 --> 06:27.160
that Ross Coltart did a talk at a library in Victoria

06:27.880 --> 06:29.520
in Australia.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.680
And at the very end, he mentioned EG and G.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.760
And I think it was JT4 and some other stuff.

06:35.760 --> 06:40.760
And I think that was when I got past the cool video part

06:42.040 --> 06:44.040
and started actually digging in to like,

06:44.040 --> 06:47.120
oh, we're talking about, you know, companies

06:47.120 --> 06:49.520
and organizations and agencies and this stuff, you know,

06:49.520 --> 06:50.360
this is a lot bigger.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.600
And I know there were people there before me, you know,

06:53.600 --> 06:55.760
it's funny now, going back, looking through Reddit

06:55.760 --> 06:57.280
and stuff, doing research where it's like,

06:57.280 --> 07:01.200
oh, people were there even before Grush, you know,

07:01.320 --> 07:02.680
they started digging in.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.480
But for me, it was kind of moving past some of the shock,

07:08.480 --> 07:11.640
I guess, you know, and getting to a point where it's like,

07:11.640 --> 07:13.040
yeah, this is more than real.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.160
It's like, there's just, the history of this is a lot bigger

07:17.160 --> 07:19.240
than I think any of us had realized.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.600
Yeah, and that's something I really appreciate about

07:21.600 --> 07:24.440
kind of your work in the eight parts we're gonna talk about.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.560
Videos to me at least mean very little.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.200
And I'm super vocal about this almost every video I do.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.760
It's kind of the hard nose paper trail,

07:31.760 --> 07:34.040
the official documents, the alleged documents,

07:34.040 --> 07:36.600
the alleged involvement of certain contractors

07:36.600 --> 07:38.800
and three little organizations that that's kind of

07:38.800 --> 07:41.520
the research avenues I like to go down to actually kind of

07:41.520 --> 07:45.720
move a conversation forward instead of just going in circles

07:45.720 --> 07:49.800
about some lights in the sky footage or and so forth.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.360
Right, because there's not that much to do

07:52.360 --> 07:54.360
with that necessarily.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.920
No, no, yeah.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.160
But that's why we're all here, you know, to a degree.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.080
So I'd love to just kind of dive into part one here

08:03.080 --> 08:06.600
because part one of your eight part series really starts

08:06.600 --> 08:08.680
to focus on the introduction of the Bush family

08:08.680 --> 08:11.400
and their involvement with the creation of the OSS,

08:11.400 --> 08:14.640
Alan Dolis and then 1933 Magenta, Italy,

08:14.640 --> 08:17.040
Crash Retrieval case, something I've covered a lot before.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.440
So I'd love to just kind of hear some summarization

08:21.440 --> 08:22.400
and points of that post.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.480
If you'd like to share your screen as well

08:24.480 --> 08:26.160
to kind of go through research, we can do that.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.880
Otherwise I can show some stuff because I think

08:28.880 --> 08:31.120
especially the base point here, part one is,

08:31.120 --> 08:34.240
is super consequential, especially with the implication

08:34.240 --> 08:36.960
of the Brown brothers and Harriman and so forth

08:36.960 --> 08:39.240
that I learned from your work.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.080
Oh, really?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.160
Yeah.

08:41.160 --> 08:46.160
So yeah, I having been so active on Reddit a few months ago,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.400
I think it was 363942 started a little private chat

08:51.400 --> 08:52.960
with a few of us.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.680
And that's when we started kind of bouncing things off

08:55.680 --> 08:57.920
of each other, you know, because really it was just them

08:57.920 --> 09:01.200
and Harry's white timeline.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.040
Right.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.760
Like I'm a, you know, I think in terms of narrative

09:04.760 --> 09:07.960
and a literal, you know, editing timeline,

09:07.960 --> 09:10.240
like let's start looking at it like that

09:10.240 --> 09:12.840
and it'll make it easier to piece this stuff together.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.640
So yeah, eventually, I mean, it really was just the last

09:18.880 --> 09:21.880
two or three months maybe that, you know, a lot of that,

09:21.880 --> 09:25.040
it was like, I was seeing Bush's name pop up

09:25.040 --> 09:27.920
in a lot of the earlier research.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.800
And then, you know, we kind of would all keep digging

09:31.800 --> 09:36.440
in different time periods and yeah,

09:36.440 --> 09:38.680
just started coming together more, you know,

09:38.680 --> 09:41.480
and the Brown brothers, Harriman stuff.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.040
I think we were kind of on that.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.200
And then I, it was really just a few weeks ago, you know,

09:47.200 --> 09:50.440
I've been watching a lot of the She-Han interviews

09:50.440 --> 09:52.360
and he had mentioned Bush a few times

09:52.360 --> 09:55.800
and there's the story of, you know, him or Carter,

09:55.800 --> 09:58.200
you know, bringing him in to brief him

09:58.200 --> 10:02.200
and Bush saying, no, and then I,

10:02.200 --> 10:06.320
one of the last interviews he did, got two weeks ago,

10:06.320 --> 10:08.760
maybe it was right before I started posting this.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.320
He pretty much spent his entire hour

10:13.320 --> 10:15.200
only talking about Bush.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.920
Yeah, that was the October 18th,

10:16.920 --> 10:19.920
year right to know interview, I believe so.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.960
It's one of his most recent ones.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.320
Yeah, maybe it was with,

10:26.200 --> 10:27.840
was that the one with Jeffrey Mishlove?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.920
Yes. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.200
And that's where he really starts to dive into Bush.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.400
I think H.W. Bush as well was mentioned by Lou Elizondo

10:36.400 --> 10:38.280
as kind of having some sort of knowledge

10:38.280 --> 10:39.800
of UFO craft retrieval programs

10:39.800 --> 10:42.800
or just an estimate of the UAP situation.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.640
Yeah, I don't know if I saw that, yeah.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.160
But yeah, just kind of,

10:47.600 --> 10:49.440
this whole thing is so crazy, you know,

10:49.440 --> 10:51.520
I think a lot of these, I mean, these posts,

10:51.520 --> 10:55.720
I was just banging them out basically late at night.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.240
You know, I just take up for, you know,

10:57.240 --> 10:59.680
six or seven hours and just like,

10:59.680 --> 11:02.240
I feel so weird walking around with this stuff, you know,

11:02.240 --> 11:04.280
I have to get it out of my head.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.680
So how did you, sorry, I'll keep on Reddit here

11:07.680 --> 11:09.080
instead of Medium, because I'm not signed in here.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.640
How did you start to connect H.W. Bush

11:11.640 --> 11:13.200
and the Bush family to Magenta?

11:13.200 --> 11:14.920
Because Magenta, of course, is a case

11:14.920 --> 11:16.400
for anybody that doesn't know,

11:16.400 --> 11:19.640
is a case that occurred in 1933 in Magenta, Italy.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.480
It was a crash lenticular object

11:21.480 --> 11:23.240
that was taken in by Mussolini.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.080
Mussolini had theorized that this was

11:25.080 --> 11:28.560
an ally of experimental aircraft, American or British,

11:28.560 --> 11:32.080
but some of his engineers, such as the RB,

11:32.080 --> 11:33.240
why can I remember right now?

11:33.240 --> 11:38.240
The RB in a number thought this was sort of an NHI craft

11:39.360 --> 11:40.600
or early thoughts of this.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.160
And then eventually information was channeled

11:43.160 --> 11:46.040
to the Americans from Pope Pius, the I can't remember.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.040
And eventually in the Pius the 12th,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.880
and in the closing years and days of World War II,

11:50.880 --> 11:52.200
somehow the Americans were able

11:52.200 --> 11:53.360
to get their hands on this craft.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.420
So how the heck did you connect that

11:55.420 --> 11:57.460
with Alan Dolos and the Bush family?

11:58.920 --> 12:01.200
So really I have to give most of the credit

12:01.200 --> 12:05.640
to 36, 39 here and Harry before that,

12:05.640 --> 12:07.740
before he kind of dropped his mic on Reddit.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.880
Yeah, I think Dolos had been coming up a lot

12:12.880 --> 12:14.920
and I wasn't even that familiar with him.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.600
And so much of this has been a true history lesson

12:19.600 --> 12:23.800
outside of the topic, in terms of the inner workings

12:23.800 --> 12:25.460
of the CIA and all that stuff.

12:27.240 --> 12:32.000
And it's funny, I've been going back and kind of building,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.480
I've made a couple of supercuts last few days

12:35.600 --> 12:39.440
of times that Grush and other people will discuss this case.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.920
And he explicitly says, like the OSS retrieved this,

12:43.440 --> 12:45.800
when I was in the CIA, et cetera.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.840
So it was kind of put in our hands right away,

12:47.840 --> 12:51.640
but I think some of us had gotten there

12:51.640 --> 12:56.480
in a roundabout way in seeing Dolos pop up,

12:56.480 --> 12:59.680
and then learning about OSS,

12:59.680 --> 13:03.680
and then it was like the more it kept going back,

13:03.680 --> 13:07.640
and even towards the end of this kind of thread series,

13:07.640 --> 13:10.840
it was just like, this is so crazy.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.960
This is all one story.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.880
This is all like a small group of people.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.800
If you go back to Brown Brothers, Hairyman,

13:19.080 --> 13:24.080
it was Herbert Walker who was Prescott Bush's father-in-law.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.960
And Prescott Bush was H.W. Bush's father, correct?

13:28.960 --> 13:32.080
Right, so then it's Prescott Bush

13:32.080 --> 13:35.800
is running that company with Avril Hairyman.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.560
Later, Hairyman goes on to become,

13:39.560 --> 13:42.640
I think he's Eisenhower's secretary of state.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.480
He's calling a lot of shots in the government post-47.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.040
So it's the two of them at this agency.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.680
Eventually, Alan Dolos has lead counsel there.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.160
Some of these folks knew each other from Yale.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.280
There's a huge skull and bones connection.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.200
Yeah, I realized again towards the end of this,

14:02.200 --> 14:06.600
the skull and bones was a primary recruiting source

14:06.600 --> 14:10.120
for the CIA at the behest of Prescott Bush.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.360
Well, you really, I mean, we started to see

14:13.360 --> 14:17.400
how a lot of his power was very, very centralized

14:17.400 --> 14:18.960
within a small group of people.

14:19.960 --> 14:24.360
And that George H.W. Bush was eventually at the head of it.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.400
He's kind of brought him to the fold in the 40s

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
after he graduated from Yale.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.920
Yeah, and H.W. Bush was as kind of a higher up in the CIA.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.000
He was kept under wraps for a while, right?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.400
Up until his almost presidential run.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.360
Right, and it came out in 88

14:40.360 --> 14:43.600
when he was running for presidency.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.360
There was a paper called The Nation,

14:47.360 --> 14:49.440
I think it's a UK paper,

14:49.440 --> 14:54.440
and the journalist had found out that Bush had lied

14:54.640 --> 14:57.600
about how long he'd been in the CIA.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.640
He said he'd been brought in in 76 as the director,

15:01.640 --> 15:05.200
but really he was traced back to like 61.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.480
And apparently he was briefed about JFK

15:08.480 --> 15:10.600
within the week after the assassination.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.520
And then people have been commenting the last week or so.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.720
There's been some closer connections there possibly

15:17.720 --> 15:21.120
about him being in Dallas and taking a flight around

15:21.120 --> 15:24.280
and making some anonymous phone call and all this stuff.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.600
And yeah.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.320
So one of the things that really kind of part one

15:29.320 --> 15:33.160
of your research relies on is a book that She-Han

15:33.200 --> 15:36.000
was kind of advertising on his shelf during an interview.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.840
This book is called Nazi Hydra in America,

15:39.840 --> 15:42.160
Suppressed History of a Giant.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.880
And this was featured on his shelves.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.160
And throughout this book,

15:45.160 --> 15:47.600
this talks about how Prescott Bush helped

15:47.600 --> 15:50.760
like the Nazis ascension in kind of a,

15:50.760 --> 15:55.760
alongside the Brown Brothers and Harriman and so forth.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.640
So can you talk a little bit more about that,

15:57.640 --> 16:00.480
how Prescott Bush and the Bush family was actually kind of

16:00.480 --> 16:03.720
entwined with the OSS as well as Hitler's ascension

16:03.720 --> 16:06.080
and kind of the fascist party rise in the U.S.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.480
there in the 30s.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.320
Yeah.

16:08.320 --> 16:13.320
I mean, those guys helped fund the business plot in 33,

16:14.360 --> 16:17.680
which was kind of parallel with Hitler at the time,

16:17.680 --> 16:19.600
you know, and that they were trying to basically

16:19.600 --> 16:23.640
overthrow FDR after he was inaugurated

16:23.640 --> 16:27.040
and install, you know, a fascist dictator.

16:27.040 --> 16:31.280
And that failed, you know, sort of Hitler's plan.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.120
And eventually, yeah,

16:34.120 --> 16:37.120
they all forget some of the details

16:37.120 --> 16:38.560
cause a lot of worries, Rushdale.

16:38.560 --> 16:42.680
But, you know, those guys were at the core of banking

16:42.680 --> 16:46.720
and Wall Street and the steel industry

16:46.720 --> 16:51.560
and shipping and a bunch of stuff.

16:51.560 --> 16:56.680
And yeah, they were actively funding the Nazis.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.880
And set up a separate bank basically,

17:00.880 --> 17:02.240
specifically for that, you know,

17:02.240 --> 17:04.240
and they got in trouble for that later.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.520
But it was all the same people, you know,

17:07.520 --> 17:08.760
it was Prescott Bush.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.880
I think, I don't think Harryman was involved with that.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.440
You know, I think he was actually pretty upset

17:16.440 --> 17:18.160
because he was Jewish.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.960
Or he was Jewish or his wife was Jewish,

17:19.960 --> 17:22.440
but he went to Germany and came back

17:22.440 --> 17:27.040
and forced his brother to close their office in Hamburg

17:28.040 --> 17:29.480
once he saw what was happening,

17:29.480 --> 17:32.680
I think in like 35 or 36.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.080
So one of the players you also talk about

17:35.080 --> 17:36.280
on the American side of things,

17:36.280 --> 17:38.880
of course we talked a little bit about Prescott Bush,

17:38.880 --> 17:42.240
George H. W. Bush, we'll talk more about Alan Dolis,

17:42.240 --> 17:44.160
but is James Angleton,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.800
who later on in his life became an OSS agent.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.480
This was the kind of intelligence organization

17:49.480 --> 17:51.200
that preceded the CIA.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.280
Angleton was a child in 33 living in Magenta, Italy.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.400
Was he not?

17:55.400 --> 17:56.560
He was in Milan.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.400
He was like three miles away.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.920
He was in Milan, three miles away.

17:58.920 --> 18:03.080
Yeah, so possible they were first hand witnesses

18:03.080 --> 18:05.040
or they definitely heard about it.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.520
And he was the youngest agent

18:06.520 --> 18:08.600
under Bill Donovan at the time, right?

18:08.600 --> 18:12.040
Yeah, he was like 16 or 17, yeah.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.320
So of course, now with these early days,

18:15.320 --> 18:16.840
have you been able to make any connections

18:16.840 --> 18:18.240
with specifically Dick Cheney

18:18.240 --> 18:21.160
and kind of the Bush legacy of the Magenta crash?

18:23.280 --> 18:26.960
Only in that Prescott was there.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.040
Like Prescott for sure knew about it.

18:29.040 --> 18:34.040
And you got Dolis, Donovan, Angleton.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.520
Most of these people were Yale.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.400
It's like the whole Bush family was Yale, Skoll and Bones.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.440
Angleton was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.160
Donovan was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.800
Dolis, I forget.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.800
But they were all part of the same like white elite,

18:59.920 --> 19:04.920
university dudes who basically formed the OSS.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.200
Right, because of 36, 39, 42,

19:09.200 --> 19:11.560
some of the crux of his research in the Magenta case

19:11.560 --> 19:14.040
is analyzing Alan Dolis and the good old boys

19:14.040 --> 19:16.000
and how they arranged the intelligence

19:16.040 --> 19:17.880
to kind of get the UFO out of,

19:17.880 --> 19:19.400
whether it was Germany or Italy at the time,

19:19.400 --> 19:20.800
but post World War II,

19:20.800 --> 19:22.840
specifically revolving around Alan Dolis.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.080
That's how most of his research applies.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.880
And I find it really interesting,

19:27.880 --> 19:31.080
you were able to bring Skoll and Bones into this.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.720
If any of you don't know Skoll and Bones,

19:32.720 --> 19:34.600
especially for our European audience,

19:34.600 --> 19:37.360
Skoll and Bones is a US based secret society.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.720
Think of in the early 2000s

19:38.720 --> 19:41.760
when Alex Jones infiltrated the Bilderberg group.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.560
Skoll and Bones is a Yale society.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.720
Who knows what they get up to?

19:46.720 --> 19:49.040
I think there's rumors that they burn like an owl effigy

19:49.040 --> 19:51.080
or just do very strange stuff.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.720
But throughout, it's so strange,

19:53.720 --> 19:55.800
but you were able to connect,

19:55.800 --> 19:57.320
let me find some of these members.

19:57.320 --> 20:01.080
You were able to connect guys like Alan Dolis, George HW Bush,

20:01.080 --> 20:03.680
Prescott Bush and so forth to this secret society.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.000
How does, would you say Skoll and Bones relates

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
to kind of OSS, CIA and legacy possible programs?

20:11.840 --> 20:15.200
I mean, I guess, you know, because it just so happened

20:15.200 --> 20:20.000
that it was those guys that were coming out of,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.960
you know, not just that university, you know,

20:22.960 --> 20:26.160
but that specific, you know, secret society fraternity,

20:27.240 --> 20:28.160
whatever you want to call it.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.480
And then those were the guys that formed the OSS, you know,

20:32.480 --> 20:37.240
and then in 47, those were the guys

20:37.240 --> 20:40.000
that formed the CIA post Roswell.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.160
So it was kind of like they've been in on this

20:42.160 --> 20:44.080
the entire time.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.000
Especially cause there's one individual here

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I'd like you to expand on a little more,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.160
Richard Bissell, who declined to be in the Skoll and Bones,

20:52.160 --> 20:55.200
but by this I can assume he attended Yale.

20:55.200 --> 21:00.200
Tell us what, so tell us what he said to Harold Malmgren,

21:01.480 --> 21:05.600
former president, daughter, father, presidential advisor

21:05.600 --> 21:08.160
and very, very senior member, Richard Malm,

21:08.160 --> 21:09.960
Harold Malmgren, sorry.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.080
Right, right, right, yeah.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.520
I mean, that was really new to me, you know,

21:12.520 --> 21:14.160
I know that went pretty viral, you know,

21:14.160 --> 21:17.120
at least in this community when he tweeted that out,

21:17.120 --> 21:22.120
but yeah, I think he said in 63 that Bissell had told him,

21:22.120 --> 21:23.880
you know, about it an exotic, you know,

21:23.880 --> 21:25.960
reverse engineering program,

21:25.960 --> 21:29.020
and the era of, yeah, NHI, you know, tech basically.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.560
And then it turned out that, yeah,

21:31.560 --> 21:35.320
Bissell was at Yale at the same time.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.720
He declined to be part of Skoll and Bones,

21:37.720 --> 21:39.700
but his brother was in it.

21:39.740 --> 21:44.260
So there's a good chance he knew those guys back then as well.

21:44.260 --> 21:47.620
You know, he was brought in, I don't know his history,

21:47.620 --> 21:50.660
I haven't read that into it, not much into it yet,

21:50.660 --> 21:55.660
but you know, in 47, he's asked by Avril Harriman,

21:56.700 --> 22:01.700
a brown brother's Harriman to basically run the Marshall Plan

22:04.620 --> 22:07.920
and go over to Europe, talk them into borrowing money

22:07.920 --> 22:11.640
from the US, you know, for reconstruction.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.840
And so you start to see that Bissell, you know,

22:13.840 --> 22:16.760
becomes this new figure at the heart of this, you know,

22:16.760 --> 22:21.400
and in 50, at some point,

22:21.400 --> 22:23.960
he's working for the CIA after that.

22:23.960 --> 22:28.960
And I think it's in 54 that he decides that Area 51

22:31.200 --> 22:36.200
is gonna be a good spot to test out a new aircraft.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.480
Right, Bissell, yes, that's a great point.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.600
Bissell proposed the site of Area 51.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.440
Right, right.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.760
And Bissell told Malmgren, I think the exact quote

22:45.760 --> 22:49.080
was of like an other world technologies.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.420
That's right, yeah.

22:50.420 --> 22:51.680
I know that phrase very well,

22:51.680 --> 22:53.360
because of course I have covered an alleged

22:53.360 --> 22:55.080
off-world technologies division,

22:55.080 --> 22:57.680
and when Malmgren made those outstanding statements,

22:57.680 --> 23:00.600
I can't tell you how many people kind of sent me screenshots

23:00.600 --> 23:01.440
of that tweet.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.280
Oh, really?

23:02.280 --> 23:05.520
So he set up the space for Area 51.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.560
Right.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.560
And then...

23:07.560 --> 23:08.400
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

23:08.400 --> 23:12.120
Quick with Bissell, I just, I don't remember.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.760
I know I think I had included it, you know,

23:13.760 --> 23:18.760
it's kind of at the tail end of things, but so 54,

23:18.760 --> 23:23.760
he decides on Area 51, 55 versus, I think it was 55.

23:27.520 --> 23:32.520
He brings the plans for the U-2 to the Air Force

23:33.520 --> 23:35.240
and they turn them down.

23:35.240 --> 23:40.240
And so he has CIA pilots test flying the U-2 in Area 51.

23:42.000 --> 23:42.840
Right.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.440
And what's interesting about that is Area 51

23:46.440 --> 23:51.440
and the U-2 program out of Area 51 was also sponsored by,

23:51.840 --> 23:54.120
that remote detachment was sponsored by

23:54.120 --> 23:55.960
Edwards Air Force Base, California,

23:55.960 --> 23:58.040
who was also laterally connected

23:58.040 --> 23:59.880
to reverse engineering programs.

23:59.880 --> 24:00.720
Right, okay.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.960
That's also a very interesting point.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.040
So you have in your timeline here,

24:05.040 --> 24:07.400
kind of starting in the 1930s with Brown Brothers

24:07.400 --> 24:09.400
and Harriman and Bush families

24:09.400 --> 24:11.520
and how the Bush family helped Hitler rise to power,

24:11.520 --> 24:14.480
but was also instrumental in forming the OSS.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.240
You mentioned the Roswell crash in 1947.

24:17.240 --> 24:20.520
Come 1948, you mentioned a company called Dresser Industries.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.000
How do they play into this?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.640
Oh man, yeah, this was huge.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.680
This kind of, yeah, this tied everything together later on.

24:29.680 --> 24:34.000
So Dresser Industries was a company that was bought

24:34.000 --> 24:38.960
by Prescott Bush and Alan Dulles, I think.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.960
And they used that company to start Zapata Oil

24:46.760 --> 24:51.760
in I think 51 and they put George H.W. in charge of that.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.880
And so this is where a lot of the things where it's like,

24:55.880 --> 24:59.640
oh, okay, the same people that have access

24:59.640 --> 25:04.640
to this exotic tech are the same people who started Big Oil.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.600
So they're running things in all directions at the same time.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.600
And they're also, of course, directly involved with the CIA.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.440
So you can start to see that

25:16.440 --> 25:19.240
these things are all part of the same story.

25:19.240 --> 25:23.280
That's something that, although he's quite controversial,

25:23.280 --> 25:25.760
that Steven Greer talks about quite a bit.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.520
I know in his redacted witness list,

25:27.520 --> 25:30.040
he has witnesses from companies that I'm highly suspecting

25:30.040 --> 25:32.480
or something like a general electric

25:32.480 --> 25:34.880
who talk about knowledge of suppressed kind of

25:34.880 --> 25:38.120
exotic technologies to kind of reinforce the oil industry

25:38.120 --> 25:40.880
and continue dependence on oil and so forth.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.120
Oh, interesting, okay.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.760
As well as other companies like AT&T and Bell Labs.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.120
So Greer talks a lot about kind of tight energy

25:49.120 --> 25:52.480
and oil tycoons having knowledge of exotic technologies,

25:52.480 --> 25:54.400
but continuing the suppression.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.240
Oh, interesting.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.480
Okay, that makes sense.

25:56.480 --> 26:01.160
Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, this is when, you know,

26:01.160 --> 26:02.400
things start getting really crazy

26:02.400 --> 26:04.520
because you start to realize like, cool,

26:04.520 --> 26:06.960
this is just kind of one empire

26:06.960 --> 26:08.920
that's been running the whole show.

26:08.920 --> 26:13.600
You know, and as far as dresser industries in the 90s

26:13.600 --> 26:18.600
when Cheney, oh, there's so many players now I'm gonna forget.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.800
That's all right, there's so many people.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.960
Cheney was secretary,

26:26.960 --> 26:31.640
Cheney was secretary of defense for Bush.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.600
Is that right?

26:32.600 --> 26:33.440
Yes.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.800
But George HW and at the same time,

26:36.800 --> 26:39.600
they're making oil deals and arms deals and stuff.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.080
And he's doing stuff with Halliburton.

26:42.080 --> 26:46.200
And then after George, after Bush loses,

26:47.320 --> 26:50.920
I think Cheney goes in a private industry for a little bit.

26:50.920 --> 26:55.920
And in 98, Halliburton merges with dresser industries.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.000
So that's when you start to see

26:59.000 --> 27:01.400
these like legacy families come together, you know,

27:01.400 --> 27:04.200
the Bush empire that had been going on for decades.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.160
And then this new Cheney empire that started,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.680
I don't know, I guess in the 80s, you know,

27:09.680 --> 27:11.720
maybe there's more business dealings before that,

27:11.720 --> 27:15.760
but you start, you know, and you see in 98,

27:15.760 --> 27:17.520
like that's when they joined forces, you know,

27:17.520 --> 27:18.800
before the election.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.120
That's fascinating, research trails like that

27:21.120 --> 27:22.720
just kind of uncovered.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.880
I'm astonished you were able to pick on

27:24.880 --> 27:27.240
some of these intricacies like dresser industries

27:27.240 --> 27:28.080
and so forth.

27:28.080 --> 27:28.920
Oh, it was so crazy.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.280
Because every, I mean, you know, again,

27:30.280 --> 27:32.920
I was just staying up late and doing this

27:32.920 --> 27:37.640
and it was really hard to keep track of it all,

27:37.640 --> 27:41.080
especially because I was writing it out, you know,

27:41.080 --> 27:42.880
kind of as I found it, you know,

27:42.880 --> 27:45.000
because it was still astonishing.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.800
And I was worried if I didn't get it all down

27:48.800 --> 27:51.800
and post it, I'd forget it because I was just,

27:51.800 --> 27:53.760
there was so much information involved, you know?

27:53.760 --> 27:56.600
So that's why I actually started this,

27:56.600 --> 28:01.600
the night that that tweet about Cheney came out

28:01.640 --> 28:02.960
because I was like, oh, okay,

28:02.960 --> 28:05.280
this is, there's something really, really here then,

28:05.280 --> 28:07.080
you know, I have to really get this out of my head

28:07.080 --> 28:09.240
and get it all down.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.120
And yeah, just the more I kept digging,

28:12.120 --> 28:13.880
it was just like, oh, like every time,

28:13.880 --> 28:16.280
every single time I was writing these out, you know,

28:16.280 --> 28:19.120
I was just like, this is all completely insane.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.440
Now, I find it so interesting.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.200
What was the interview in which the interviewer states

28:23.200 --> 28:26.200
that Grush said that Cheney sat on top of the pyramid?

28:26.200 --> 28:27.520
What, who was the interviewer?

28:27.520 --> 28:29.160
I can't remember the show.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.560
I was Walter Kern.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.800
Walter Kern is, I think, the editor,

28:34.800 --> 28:37.960
editor-in-chief of the County Highway,

28:37.960 --> 28:40.200
which is the new print-only newspaper

28:40.200 --> 28:43.360
that came out last summer.

28:43.360 --> 28:47.080
And I think the second issue did that interview with Grush

28:47.080 --> 28:49.440
that I didn't know about till a few months ago.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.360
And then, of course, there's the 2000, 2001 radio show

28:52.360 --> 28:54.120
in which a researcher, Grant Cameron,

28:54.120 --> 28:58.080
who from a presidential UFO called in,

28:58.080 --> 28:59.640
asking Cheney about programs.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.440
And Cheney said, if I was briefed into one,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.080
it'd probably be classified and I couldn't talk about it.

29:04.080 --> 29:04.920
Right, right.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.200
And I might have forgotten to include it,

29:06.200 --> 29:09.720
but four years later in 2005,

29:09.720 --> 29:12.840
there's a story I found from the Herald Tribune

29:12.840 --> 29:16.520
where Cameron was trying,

29:16.520 --> 29:17.960
I think he was trying to fly,

29:17.960 --> 29:20.920
he flew into California to attend

29:20.920 --> 29:23.600
some UFO convention or something.

29:23.600 --> 29:27.080
And I think he wanted to try and track down Cheney

29:27.080 --> 29:28.880
and custom stopped him

29:28.880 --> 29:31.200
and they made him go back to Canada.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.880
Oh, I haven't read that.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.760
Yeah, I might have forgotten to include that in the post,

29:35.760 --> 29:39.560
but, so yeah, I mean, Cameron knows a lot of stuff,

29:39.560 --> 29:41.080
you know, obviously.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.280
Have you had a chance to dive into his file base?

29:44.280 --> 29:46.560
I used a lot of his internal research files

29:46.560 --> 29:48.280
for my Kecksburg research.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.600
No, I feel like I'm actually behind on a lot of people

29:51.600 --> 29:53.320
as far as the stuff goes,

29:53.320 --> 29:56.800
because it's like, I think we're all just consuming

29:56.800 --> 29:58.280
different things at different times.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.880
And then, you know, that's when we start

29:59.880 --> 30:01.520
to kind of boltron it all together.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.360
Right.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.800
You know, because that's, it's just so big.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.640
You know, and I think that's the point, you know.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.200
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself there.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.240
Cameron has, I think he posted a picture of his office

30:13.240 --> 30:14.920
before he uploaded all of his documents

30:14.920 --> 30:17.880
and he had an entire office filled with just papers.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.400
I don't scratch the surface of going through his files

30:20.400 --> 30:24.880
on Eric Walker, Lyndon B. Johnson, and kind of James Webb.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.800
So there is so much more to go.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
I don't even know how any of those people are involved.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.240
Yeah, so.

30:30.240 --> 30:34.680
So let's, now let's hop on to part three.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.920
A part three and four, I think we're actually combined,

30:36.920 --> 30:37.760
right?

30:38.760 --> 30:40.080
Yeah, I posted them.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.360
I think I was having trouble.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.960
I was posting too soon or something.

30:43.960 --> 30:44.440
Oh, OK.

30:44.440 --> 30:48.040
Yeah, because I got, I saw one post was wrong.

30:48.040 --> 30:51.040
And I just, I wrote them both pretty quickly.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.800
So in part, what was the crux of kind of part four

30:54.800 --> 30:55.640
that you were talking about?

30:55.640 --> 30:58.520
You mentioned a lot more on the players of Alan Dolis,

30:58.520 --> 31:01.040
his death, you were talking a little bit about Gerald Ford,

31:01.040 --> 31:03.640
which was pretty interesting, the church committee,

31:03.640 --> 31:06.240
and so forth, a little bit about Cheney and Rumsfeld.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.480
So what was a little bit of the crux of your research

31:08.480 --> 31:10.960
here in this part?

31:10.960 --> 31:13.880
Yeah, I think that was, yeah, again, I mean,

31:13.880 --> 31:15.680
these were almost extreme of consciousness.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.120
I don't really remember exactly.

31:18.120 --> 31:18.400
Right.

31:21.040 --> 31:25.120
I think it was tracing back how everybody knew each other

31:25.120 --> 31:29.920
and knew probably about this subject.

31:29.920 --> 31:36.080
And so you've got Nixon, who was Eisenhower's VP.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.520
And Eisenhower, very famous stories about him

31:39.520 --> 31:44.960
and possible meetings and agreements and stuff.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.200
So of course, Nixon probably knew something too.

31:49.200 --> 31:55.360
And then I'm forgetting exactly, but I think it was in the 60s

31:55.360 --> 32:05.920
that Ford and Cheney and Rumsfeld first all met working.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.040
Whatever they were doing, I forget exactly now.

32:09.040 --> 32:13.440
But those guys go back to the mid-60s, basically.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.920
And then in the 70s, when Ford takes office

32:17.920 --> 32:24.400
after Nixon resigns, he installs Bush, a CIA director,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.720
following the church committee.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.760
Basically, the CIA was in shambles post-Watergate.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.800
They were completely busted.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.440
And so they installed Bush.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.840
After Bush has had this very strange career of having,

32:37.840 --> 32:40.720
I think he was in office for two years as a senator or something.

32:40.720 --> 32:46.960
And then he's the envoy to China or ambassador to China

32:46.960 --> 32:51.200
and some other cushy role and just kind of strange stuff there.

32:51.200 --> 33:01.120
And then so at that time, you've got Ford, Bush, Rumsfeld

33:01.200 --> 33:06.800
was, I forget, like Secretary of State maybe for Ford.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.840
And then Cheney becomes White House Chief of Staff,

33:11.840 --> 33:13.040
if I remember correctly.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.360
Right?

33:15.360 --> 33:20.880
Yeah, I think Cheney was a staffer for Rumsfeld.

33:21.760 --> 33:25.360
And so then when Rumsfeld is given the role of Secretary,

33:25.360 --> 33:26.800
if I think it's Secretary of State,

33:27.600 --> 33:32.240
he recommends that Cheney take over as Chief of Staff.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.880
So you've got all of these guys.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.960
You've got Bush, Ford, Cheney, Rumsfeld going back.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.720
And then here you talk a little bit also about Jimmy Carter

33:42.720 --> 33:45.520
and also his involvement with Sheehan, which I found so interesting.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.080
Because of course, before he took office,

33:48.080 --> 33:50.240
Carter was pretty outspoken about UFOs

33:50.240 --> 33:51.840
and wanting to investigate the situation

33:51.840 --> 33:53.680
because he had his own personal siting.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.160
And then while he was president,

33:56.160 --> 33:58.720
Carter wanted to move a little bit off of oil and so forth.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.480
And according to Sheehan, I've talked about this a few times,

34:03.360 --> 34:04.880
Sheehan was sent by Jimmy Carter

34:04.880 --> 34:07.600
to access the classified section of Blue Book files.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.120
And that is where the infamous story,

34:09.120 --> 34:12.800
he saw a photo of a crash retrieval with symbols drawn on it.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.360
You mentioned Michael Schrat's drawings of those.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.720
I kind of wanted to bring those up too while we discuss this incident

34:18.720 --> 34:20.000
because this is great.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.360
So Michael Schrat, I think, held a drawing competition for the alleged.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.400
Crash that Sheehan discussed.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.280
And I think this was 79, right? 79?

34:30.560 --> 34:31.680
No, it's a 77.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.520
So the story that Sheehan has been telling is that

34:36.480 --> 34:40.400
I think it was like nine days after Carter was elected.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.560
That was kind of a prime interest to him.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.200
And he summoned Bush down to his home at Savannah.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.280
And just asked him, like, cool,

34:51.360 --> 34:53.280
what's going on with this UFO stuff?

34:53.280 --> 34:56.000
And Bush told him, like, I'm only going to tell you

34:56.000 --> 34:57.440
if you keep me on as director.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.120
Carter said, no, it's fine.

34:59.120 --> 35:06.400
So he ousted Bush when he took office and then had Sheehan go into the Blue Book.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.880
However, that worked out.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.120
He actually got in and found this photo

35:11.120 --> 35:12.800
and made that drawing and everything.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.440
And then there's the famous story, of course.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.960
I don't know if this is validated or not of Jimmy Carter

35:18.960 --> 35:23.600
receiving some sort of briefing to some extent on UFOs

35:23.600 --> 35:26.400
and basically was left in a catatonic crying state.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.560
I don't know if that story's been substantiated or not.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.800
I mean, that's I'm looking into that.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.040
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty popular.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.880
And I think, oh, man, I forget.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.480
Somebody had commented recently that, yeah,

35:40.480 --> 35:43.040
one of those other guys may have been like in the room

35:43.760 --> 35:44.480
when he got that.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.760
OK, I forget who exactly.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.400
And I don't know if I put it in any of the threads.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.000
I think it was after I wrote all of this stuff.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.680
But yeah, I mean, if you look at the 77 timeline,

35:56.880 --> 35:59.840
so he so Bush is out as director.

36:02.560 --> 36:08.880
And Carter does away with the Atomic Energy Commission.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.760
There's some other particulars yet.

36:12.400 --> 36:16.000
That splits into the DOE and NNSA.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.080
A lot of people don't look at records or pay attention to the NNSA.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.280
They only pay attention to the DOE in regards to legacy programs.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.040
However, especially back in the 80s,

36:25.040 --> 36:29.600
NNSA was a cataloging reports of UAP over nuclear sites throughout the US.

36:30.800 --> 36:31.840
Oh, interesting.

36:31.840 --> 36:32.560
OK, I didn't know that.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.640
So sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.080
You were talking about 1977.

36:38.080 --> 36:44.560
I mean, I think what makes sense to me is that he goes to Bush, gets denied,

36:45.120 --> 36:45.920
Bush is out.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.080
He does away with the Atomic Energy Commission, I think,

36:50.080 --> 36:51.920
in like right away, February or March.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.720
He has she and go in.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.040
I forget.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.760
I think that might have been March as well.

37:01.520 --> 37:08.720
I think Carter gets briefed in May or June,

37:10.080 --> 37:14.160
and then immediately signs into law the DOE.

37:14.960 --> 37:19.360
And the DOE becomes established in mid-August, I think.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.280
And so it's like, who knows this tech exists?

37:24.480 --> 37:26.480
He's coming off of the oil crisis.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.160
I'd done it for a completely different project years ago.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.880
I did a lot of research into that stuff, OPEC and all that.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.880
So I think there's a very clear timeline in that Carter knows this is all real,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.360
and he knows we can be doing something better and we can be off of oil.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.840
But I think the grand irony is that he establishes the DOE,

37:48.800 --> 37:52.080
which is set up at the James Forest Hall building of all places.

37:53.920 --> 37:59.200
And then they use the DOE just to keep hiding all the same stuff.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.000
Right.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.640
Yeah, of course, in 54, there's the Atomic Energy Agreement, which to this day

38:06.160 --> 38:10.160
keeps materials from ever being declassified UAP materials as they can be

38:10.240 --> 38:13.920
misclassified as transnuclear foreign material.

38:13.920 --> 38:17.840
And then, of course, the DOE and NNSA have other regulations.

38:17.840 --> 38:21.840
So I was surprised to learn in one of my recent projects was of some of the

38:21.840 --> 38:27.440
hypothetical reverse engineering and craft programs out at Nellis Area 51 and so forth,

38:27.440 --> 38:31.440
that DOE owns much of the land there in the Nevada test and training range.

38:32.560 --> 38:32.880
Right.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.640
And yeah, I learned a lot of that recently, too.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.680
I think they also own the land at Los Alamos.

38:37.680 --> 38:42.080
And so that's kind of this weird deal where they own the land,

38:42.080 --> 38:47.040
they lease it to the contractors, and I think also to the military.

38:47.680 --> 38:53.280
And so they are kind of the umbrella over a lot of this stuff.

38:54.320 --> 39:00.800
And I don't understand like what it means if they, you know, was admitted by,

39:01.760 --> 39:03.520
was it Stephanie Granholm?

39:04.160 --> 39:04.800
I think so.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.840
With a, you know, Birchhead and Luna Cornerher, you know, make her admit that the DOE

39:09.840 --> 39:11.440
works with JSOCs in times.

39:11.440 --> 39:17.440
And his famous story of the firefight between JSOC and Lockheed,

39:18.160 --> 39:21.360
and Coltart even validated that a couple of weeks ago and said,

39:21.360 --> 39:23.040
yeah, that might not be the only one.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.360
So I'm still kind of making sense of a lot of that stuff.

39:27.360 --> 39:32.240
The DOE to the contractors and the military.

39:32.320 --> 39:40.560
But then the, how does the DOE then have its own retrieval team apart from those people?

39:40.560 --> 39:40.800
Yeah.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.920
And I think that retrieval team is likely the NEST teams,

39:43.920 --> 39:47.440
something I've talked about a couple of times in the Jonathan Waygant story.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.320
Have you heard of NEST?

39:49.520 --> 39:49.840
Yeah.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.520
The Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

39:52.320 --> 39:57.280
So one of the interesting things is, guess which company NEST is?

39:57.280 --> 40:01.520
One of the contractors NEST is housed out of EG&G,

40:01.520 --> 40:03.280
which we'll talk about in one second.

40:03.280 --> 40:08.240
So DOE has even more ties, because I can't wait to launch into this part,

40:08.240 --> 40:12.080
because this is where I think I can add a little bit of really interesting pieces.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.520
Tell me how the heck you connected EG&G and the Carlisle Group into this,

40:15.520 --> 40:19.520
because the Carlisle Group especially, I don't think nearly enough people talk about.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.160
And once we talk about that, I'm going to give a,

40:22.160 --> 40:27.120
I'm going to connect Carlisle Group to modern day disinformation with Sean Kirkpatrick.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.440
So that'll be a bit fun.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.320
Okay. I've been curious like where they stand now.

40:32.320 --> 40:39.200
Okay. So yeah, it was when Ross gave that talk and ended it with bringing up EG&G.

40:40.560 --> 40:45.440
So EG&G was a high speed photography company, run by three guys.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.760
Like those were their initials, funny enough.

40:49.440 --> 40:54.640
And they were brought in to film the nuclear test.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.280
And I think it was also because of them probably that they were catching,

40:59.280 --> 41:02.960
you know, the craft or orbs or whatever was showing up around these test sites.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.520
And who knows what else they caught.

41:05.520 --> 41:10.880
And then post-Roswell, you know, I think it was, there was like December 47

41:11.840 --> 41:13.920
at the behest of the military.

41:14.960 --> 41:21.040
They were basically asked to become, I'm forgetting now,

41:21.680 --> 41:24.960
like a joint enterprise or something so they could be contracted out.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.440
However that stuff all works.

41:28.160 --> 41:34.640
And so it sounds like basically they became the lead contractor.

41:35.840 --> 41:40.240
Like they were where things went, partly where things went private kind of right away.

41:41.280 --> 41:47.200
That the military could do what they wanted, but all the paperwork was at EG&G basically.

41:47.920 --> 41:53.360
And and then, you know, wherever people will stand on the czar and all that, you know,

41:53.920 --> 42:00.000
I think it was Bob Echler, you know, who said back in the 90s that EG&G was his employer.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.760
They are basically the employer area 51, you know, and they run Janet Airlines.

42:05.760 --> 42:08.080
You know, it's like they kind of run a lot of that show.

42:10.240 --> 42:17.040
Which that that confirmation of EG&G working or employing people at area 51 was later confirmed

42:17.040 --> 42:20.880
and who we'll talk about in a second with Eric Tabor and his Aero testimony.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.880
Oh, interesting. Okay. I'm not familiar with that.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.920
EG&G also interestingly enough, as I'm sure a lot of people know,

42:27.920 --> 42:32.080
is the parking lot where Admiral Thomas Wilson and Eric Davis met

42:32.080 --> 42:35.040
for the classic Wilson Davis notes, which is great.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.560
So you here in this post connected Ross Colthardt.

42:38.560 --> 42:45.440
And we kind of started off talking about this within this engineering badge from area 51 here.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.120
What did you take away from this?

42:47.120 --> 42:51.920
And then we'll talk about Eric Tabor, who this was his patch from his great,

42:52.960 --> 42:55.120
it was from his great uncle, I believe it was.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.640
Oh, right. Is he the guy? That's right. Okay.

42:59.360 --> 43:03.600
I think he saw it and then after his uncle died, like his uncle told him a story or something.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.040
Right. Right. Right.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.840
Yeah. This is again, you know, when I first saw this Colthardt straight up says like,

43:13.840 --> 43:16.560
oh, the internet's going to go crazy over this. Right.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.960
And I don't remember really seeing many people talk about it at all. No.

43:20.960 --> 43:25.440
So I posted it back then, just like, what does anybody think this means?

43:26.320 --> 43:31.520
And people just came at me for getting the Star Trek references wrong. Oh, really?

43:32.480 --> 43:38.000
And I was like, Star Trek, take, take, take their stuff seriously.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah. I mean, sure. You know, it's just like, that's a very ancillary part of this.

43:42.000 --> 43:49.920
But he does say that, you know, that I forget what it is. It was at 1-1-0-0, 1-0-0-1. Yes.

43:49.920 --> 43:58.160
So it's a reference to a specific next generation episode about the binars who steal.

43:58.160 --> 44:05.360
I watched it a couple of times after I read this, the binars who steal the enterprise

44:06.320 --> 44:12.880
to go help their planet or something. And it ends with like, why didn't you just ask us for help?

44:12.880 --> 44:18.560
Right. And I think it's like Picard and I'll get the other guy's name wrong.

44:20.240 --> 44:24.640
They're like, oh, we didn't, there was some, yeah, I think they asked the binars,

44:24.640 --> 44:27.280
like why didn't you just ask us for help? And they're like, oh, we didn't know if you would.

44:27.280 --> 44:33.920
So we just kind of, you know, did things on our own. So I don't know. I mean, maybe that's part of

44:33.920 --> 44:44.800
the story that some faction of NHI or something are, you know, getting help without our agreement.

44:44.800 --> 44:49.680
Or I don't know. I really don't know, you know, and then, but I did see digging into this more

44:49.680 --> 44:55.120
than Measure Analyze Protect. It might have been C. Britton or somebody else who'd found that

44:56.000 --> 44:58.080
that phrase comes up a lot in a lot of the DOE.

44:58.960 --> 45:05.600
So for anybody watching that doesn't know the story of this patch, this originated from Arrow

45:05.600 --> 45:12.480
Whistleblower who conveniently wasn't mentioned in the historical report. Eric Tabor, who I think

45:12.480 --> 45:19.600
in 2023, he testified to Arrow that his great uncle, I think his last name was Eurekart or something,

45:20.240 --> 45:26.640
he worked at Area 51 in the capacity of a sergeant from 1997 to 2014 as the head of

45:26.640 --> 45:34.160
security for like a radar cross-section facility at Area 51. And here he was privy to like images

45:34.160 --> 45:40.560
and photographs and so forth of a classic egg-shaped craft that according to what the

45:40.560 --> 45:45.920
uncle told Eric Tabor was just found abandoned in the desert. So supporting kind of the donation

45:45.920 --> 45:50.720
theory that Grush talked about, a seamless egg-shaped craft, maybe the size of a family car.

45:50.720 --> 45:54.240
Let's see if we can find an image of it because I actually have the article pulled up here and

45:54.240 --> 45:57.840
I'm sorry for the Daily Mail's ad pop-ups. I don't have an ad block right here. Yes,

45:57.840 --> 46:05.280
I use this image quite a bit. This is Eric Tabor. What year was that? His uncle, Eric Tabor,

46:05.280 --> 46:12.160
testified in 2023. Sam Yerka, I cannot pronounce that last name on the fly, was an Area 51 contractor

46:12.160 --> 46:19.200
from 97 to 2014. And Tabor is like an aerospace engineer, pretty well respected. Sorry, let me

46:19.200 --> 46:24.800
find images of that patch. Yeah. Wait, did he say when he saw that craft? No, I can't remember.

46:24.800 --> 46:30.880
He didn't give an exact date during the time. But of course, Tabor says his uncle was a contractor

46:30.880 --> 46:37.600
at Area 51 on the behest of EGNG. Which is to me part of, I mean, every now and then there's some

46:37.600 --> 46:44.720
kind of cosmic humor in this that you've got, you know, an egg-shaped craft at, you know, EGNG

46:44.720 --> 46:49.520
facilities. Oh, okay. So actually, maybe we do have a date. He said when he first got there in

46:49.520 --> 46:54.960
1997, I had a personal conversation with a senior EGNG engineer whose group was tasked with trying

46:54.960 --> 46:59.840
to reverse engineer an object that was brought there by some CIA people in the 1980s. Which

46:59.840 --> 47:06.400
that's interesting to me because that might talk about the CIA and CIA, OGA and JSOC participating

47:06.400 --> 47:14.160
in retrievals even before kind of the start of the OGA in 2003. Right. 2002, 2001. But that of

47:14.160 --> 47:19.760
course is for foreign retrieval. So who knows who knows what kind of a retrieval the CIA may have

47:19.760 --> 47:26.160
had their hands in. Yeah, eventually. Do you know when and I was trying to find this the other day

47:26.160 --> 47:34.720
when in 2003, OGA became its own agency? No, I'm trying to think back to Chris Sharpe's reporting.

47:35.280 --> 47:38.800
But I can't remember exactly when I don't know if a date is listed there.

47:39.760 --> 47:44.400
Because I, yeah, I think it's, well, you haven't read part eight yet and that's when things get

47:44.400 --> 47:51.280
really fun. Okay, okay. So we'll continue on so we can get to part eight. Now, one of the companies

47:51.280 --> 47:58.720
that ran EGNG from 1997 to 2001 that you bring up is of course the Carlisle Group. The Carlisle

47:58.720 --> 48:04.880
Group has been implicated many times as one of the lead proponents of the control group of the UAP

48:04.880 --> 48:09.200
topic. What did you find out about the Carlisle Group within this within this piece part five?

48:11.280 --> 48:17.520
Oh, man. I'm not sure how some of that info was divvied up between these.

48:19.360 --> 48:25.760
Yeah, it just really stuck out to me that they were so they make a they made a deal

48:26.160 --> 48:39.920
in 96 with the Saudis, Saudi royalty. And that money goes back to the Bush family back to

48:41.280 --> 48:46.480
at least 51 with Zapata oil. So those guys have been working together a long time. And

48:48.160 --> 48:52.960
I think over time, EGNG kept getting split up into like different

48:55.760 --> 49:03.040
not branches, but like different subholding companies or something. Right. And so it just

49:03.040 --> 49:11.360
stuck out that you've got, you know, Carlisle, it turns out that their board was Bush,

49:13.920 --> 49:23.280
his secretary, State James Baker, UK Prime Minister, John Major. Oh, really? I didn't know that.

49:24.240 --> 49:30.800
Carlucci, who was part of his staff. And I'm forgetting another guy who was part of his staff.

49:30.800 --> 49:39.120
So it was like Bush and three of his top White House people all basically at the head of Carlisle

49:39.120 --> 49:46.880
Group alongside billionaire and chef Rubenstein. Right. So in 1987, David Rubenstein, he was the

49:46.880 --> 49:51.440
domestic policy advisor to Carter when he started the Carlisle Group. That's right. And

49:52.080 --> 49:56.400
that's funny. You mentioned Frank Carlucci. I need to know if one of my guys Kai is in the chat

49:56.400 --> 50:02.080
right now. Kai is really big into the subject of ARV as Greer puts it. And that mention of Frank

50:02.080 --> 50:06.960
Carlucci, if he's here, I need to bring something up to him real fast because Frank, the specific

50:06.960 --> 50:11.360
mention of Frank Carlucci with the Carlisle Group is what I think is one of the most

50:11.360 --> 50:15.520
consequential mentions here. I know it's, I know it's like a one sentence thing when you got heavy

50:15.520 --> 50:20.960
hitters like Rubenstein and the Bush family and the dozens of Saudi investors within Carlisle Group.

50:21.040 --> 50:28.000
But how familiar are you with the Mark McCandless story? And Kai, if you're in the chat, please

50:28.000 --> 50:33.040
comment because I know you're going to love this. Maybe if I got a refresher, I feel like the name

50:33.040 --> 50:38.160
sounds kind of familiar, but yeah. Okay. So Mark McCandless was an aerospace illustrator who

50:38.160 --> 50:44.240
testified at Greer's disclosure project briefing in 2001. Mark McCandless did tons of aerospace

50:44.240 --> 50:49.600
work, was a very well respected artist with Lockheed Martin various defense contractors.

50:49.600 --> 50:57.120
In 1988, his fellow aerospace illustrator, Brad Sorensen invited Mark McCandless to go to Norton

50:57.120 --> 51:02.560
Air Force Base, California for an air show. McCandless had some last minute projects for,

51:02.560 --> 51:07.360
I think it was popular mechanics, so he ended up not going. Brad Sorensen, when he went to

51:07.360 --> 51:12.480
Norton Air Force Base, saw the air show saw some experimental craft, but he was with an individual

51:13.120 --> 51:21.040
that he described to Mark later on. And this individual and Brad Sorensen, allegedly, but I

51:21.040 --> 51:24.720
think this is far more than just an alleged story because I'm going to cover it in the

51:24.720 --> 51:28.560
near future and I have some additional info on this story. I think people might find interesting

51:28.560 --> 51:35.600
are taken to a kind of wardened off section of this air base at Norton and admitted by a general

51:35.600 --> 51:40.240
or a three, I think it was a two or three star general Air Force general. And the individual

51:40.240 --> 51:45.600
that Brad Sorensen is with says that Brad is eight, so they can get in here. There are three

51:45.600 --> 51:50.640
flying saucer craft referenced as alien reproduction vehicles. This is where the term is coined.

51:50.640 --> 51:55.280
They function off of electrogravity or zero point technologies. They're the they're the classic

51:55.280 --> 52:00.080
flux liner design, if you've ever heard of that. Yeah, it's a it's three craft sizes, the smallest

52:00.080 --> 52:05.600
one being like 40 feet across, the largest one being like 100 200 feet across, all with similar

52:05.600 --> 52:11.600
designs, all with oxygen tanks sitting radially in the crash all craft all with like capacitor

52:11.600 --> 52:16.800
plates on the bottom, all with a crew compartment with I think three seats facing around each other.

52:16.800 --> 52:21.680
This is a very interesting story because McCandillish made a new let me pull up the

52:21.680 --> 52:24.720
drawing of the flux liner just so people can see this while I talk about it.

52:26.480 --> 52:32.800
So one one funny thing to kind of backtrack a tiny bit about the Watertown stuff is that

52:33.200 --> 52:43.360
that was one of the locations at Area 51. And there's a very specific EG&G office

52:44.480 --> 52:56.720
that is opened on July 24, 1969, the day the astronauts come back. Oh, interesting.

52:56.720 --> 53:02.160
Office gets established. And then later, I don't know the timeline here, but later,

53:02.800 --> 53:10.640
the DOE is at that exact same address. Interesting. Yeah. So the the point I bring up

53:10.640 --> 53:15.680
about the ARV Mark McCandillish and Brad Sorenson is because that senior advisor

53:16.720 --> 53:23.600
that took Brad to this classified section of this air show was none other than Frank Carlucci.

53:24.320 --> 53:30.800
Oh, wow. So that's a really, really, really damn interesting connection because Carlucci is

53:30.800 --> 53:36.560
associated with Carlisle Group. Wait, what when was the November 13, 1988.

53:37.680 --> 53:43.040
So a year after Carlisle Group is formed. And of course, Mark McCandillish was

53:43.040 --> 53:51.280
unalived in 2021. Wait, what's so what's his story? I'm so as an aerospace illustrator after he was

53:51.360 --> 53:56.240
talked to by Brad about these designs, he and Brad worked for concept art for the ARV craft.

53:56.240 --> 54:00.880
Over time, he would talk about these craft and zero point systems until 2014,

54:00.880 --> 54:05.440
a documentary filmmaker named James Allen made a documentary called him called like zero point

54:05.440 --> 54:10.160
Mark McCandillish. Towards before the inner before the documentary was ever released,

54:10.160 --> 54:14.720
James Allen was diagnosed and killed by a super aggressive form of cancer within the span of

54:14.720 --> 54:20.000
weeks. And in his autopsy report, he was also found to have suffered from metal poisoning, heavy

54:20.000 --> 54:25.840
metal poisoning. About this same time, Mark McCandillish said he slept with a gun under his bed

54:25.840 --> 54:31.600
out of fear for his life. In 2021, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. I think I just

54:31.600 --> 54:38.320
heard this the other day or maybe he was catching up on your last on your episode from last week.

54:39.120 --> 54:44.000
That's right. I think we talked about that in live a little bit. Yeah. So Carlucci and the

54:44.000 --> 54:51.040
Carlisle group may be may be entwined with reverse engineering practices. And how this goes

54:51.040 --> 54:57.200
further is you, you're probably pretty familiar with Sean Kirkpatrick, right? Yeah. Do you remember

54:57.200 --> 55:04.000
in 2022, 2023, I can't remember exactly when when Arrow did a round table talk with Sean Kirkpatrick

55:04.000 --> 55:09.280
and former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.960
Yeah. I think I watched that when it came out, but I don't remember any of the details really.

55:14.960 --> 55:20.000
So Moultrie was like a huge big wig. It was here. The two said there was nothing to UAP. There was

55:20.000 --> 55:26.800
absolutely nothing. Well, Moultrie, as it turns out, sorry, let me reference my notes. Moultrie is

55:26.800 --> 55:32.720
a board member for the Better Angels, which was funded by David Rubenstein, the founder of Carlisle

55:33.440 --> 55:40.880
Group. And he is a board member in iCapital, which is Carlisle Group's most invested in

55:42.000 --> 55:47.840
group. So even Ronald Moultrie now has connections to Carlisle Group. Ronald Moultrie has had influence,

55:47.840 --> 55:53.280
or as in cahoots with Sean Kirkpatrick previously as well. Right. Okay. So I found that

55:53.600 --> 55:59.360
all with the DOE since he was like 17. So I found that, and then of course goes to Oak Ridge,

55:59.360 --> 56:05.840
National Labs, once he leaves Arrow. Well, yeah, I mean, Oak Ridge is the entire loop.

56:06.400 --> 56:14.320
Yeah. So just said Vannevar Bush, you know, and I think he got the directions to do that in 41

56:14.320 --> 56:22.560
from FDR, sets it up at 42. Whatever the timeline there is for MJ12, you know, and Vannevar Bush

56:22.560 --> 56:29.520
and everybody else. And then now we're right back to the DOE and Oak Ridge. Kirkpatrick goes

56:29.520 --> 56:36.880
there. And yeah, I just found, I was so happy when I read part five, just with EGNG and so forth.

56:36.880 --> 56:43.920
I love that because I think those, so I think those corporations are, EGNG has had some fame

56:43.920 --> 56:48.640
because of its association with Bob Lazar, but especially the Carlisle Group. I was so happy

56:48.640 --> 56:56.640
you made these ties here. Yeah. And that was, you know, I tried getting there months ago, you

56:56.640 --> 57:03.760
know, but I was still just wrapping my head around everything that was coming out. And that was

57:03.760 --> 57:10.160
actually where I wanted specifically to get back to. I didn't even intend to make this huge like

57:10.160 --> 57:14.160
series or whatever, you know, I was like, oh, let me just get back to the Carlisle, EGNG stuff.

57:14.720 --> 57:19.040
And then everything, it was like, as I kept digging, it was like, everything kept growing

57:19.040 --> 57:23.920
really fast. Oh man, okay, this is all huge. This is all one story, you know.

57:24.480 --> 57:28.240
And then of course, things get even bigger when we get to part six, where you mentioned

57:28.880 --> 57:34.080
SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation. Now, did you get a chance recently

57:34.080 --> 57:40.320
to see Kermit's post on kind of the financials of UAP legacy programs? And he talks about

57:40.320 --> 57:46.320
the startup of SAIC after various SEC regulations, which basically allow corporations to keep two

57:46.320 --> 57:52.320
books, one on record, one off record and so forth. No, I didn't see that. No, it's a wonderful piece.

57:52.320 --> 57:57.040
It harped back to, I think there was one interview in 2021, Lou Elizondo talked about,

57:57.760 --> 58:01.840
he referenced two defense contractors under the pseudonyms company A and company B,

58:01.840 --> 58:08.480
and them gaining unfair advantages within the SAIC, I mean, SEC, due to having exotic technologies.

58:08.480 --> 58:16.160
Right. Okay. Yeah, I mean, the SAIC stuff, I only really know about because of a still chill

58:16.160 --> 58:25.360
drill. They like focus specifically on that eventually, and looking at a lot of the records

58:25.360 --> 58:31.040
and stuff. And then going back and forth, we were, again, figuring out timeline, where it looks like

58:32.000 --> 58:41.040
basically blue book closes at the end of, I think Alan Dulles dies in January 69. Yeah.

58:41.680 --> 58:46.560
And then by the end of the year, blue book closes. And in that time, I've not, I've been

58:46.560 --> 58:53.120
able to find an actual month. But at some point, SAIC is started. And so it looks like basically

58:53.120 --> 58:59.760
that's where blue book maybe goes private. So now I have a way to circle back to your research as

58:59.840 --> 59:06.400
well, kind of with SAIC and Malmgren. And sorry, I'm forgetting his name, Bissell as well. So Bissell

59:06.400 --> 59:10.960
tells Malmgren about other world technologies, basically a division that studies other world

59:10.960 --> 59:17.360
technologies. I have made a video on an off world technologies division that I with a lot of research

59:17.360 --> 59:24.320
highly suspect was ran by SAIC. So now even more, even more parallels to your research.

59:24.320 --> 59:31.200
Interesting. So Bissell tells Malmgren this in 63, I think it was. Yes.

59:34.160 --> 59:43.840
And then, yeah, SAIC starts in 69. I haven't had a chance to dig into, you know, any direct

59:43.840 --> 59:49.280
connections. It's more just like, it's all at the same time, basically. So SAIC is so weird.

59:49.280 --> 59:55.120
And I'm sure you heard about all the stuff with Chris Sharpe in his Liberation Times article

59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.400
in Undersea Retrievals, right? Well, he mentions Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, guess who

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.080
has plenty of contracts with the Office of Naval Research and the NSW Crane, which is the,

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.840
which is basically a naval research in electromagnetic and expeditionary weapon lab.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.760
And Woods Hole SAIC. So SAIC, Kermit and I talk about this a lot, but they kind of have their

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.320
hands in every single piece of the pie here. So it just makes so much sense that they would kind

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:30.560
of fall into your research. Yeah, right. Okay. God, this is, yeah, I mean, yeah, the more this

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:37.600
keeps going, I mean, I think to, you know, going back over, you know, just building the supercut

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.360
stuff, you know, I'm looking to make a proper documentary on the magenta incident and all

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:51.760
that. And so I've been going back over, you know, all of Grush's, I mean, outside of Coltart, you

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:59.440
know, he did a podcast with Rebedra Panatti and Guzardi and, you know, and then Panatti

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:06.000
to the thing with Strieber talked about it. And it's come up a few other times, but

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.160
I mean, Grush says right away with Coltart, he's like, yeah, it's received by the OSS

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.240
back panel via the Vatican. OSS becomes a CIA and he throws it out there. You know, and then when

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:25.280
he goes on Rogan, Rogan asked him, you know, about this, you know, he's like, oh, I just wanted to

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:31.280
show that this goes further back. And it's international. And I thought that was interesting.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.040
And you're like, no, you knew what you were doing. You're making sure that like all of us nerds,

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:43.520
like really dig into this stuff, you know, because it's not just some other interesting case or just

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:50.400
some crash retrieval. It's like everything about who we are as a country and maybe a world kind of

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:57.360
starts there. It starts with the Bush clan getting their hands on this, you know, and again, these

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.960
people starting the CIA, keeping this stuff secret, running a rough shot all over the world, you know,

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.040
however many coups, you know, they were a part of, you know, just like ugly stuff that is

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:16.000
well known, you know, to anyone who reads history at all, you know, and so you start to see like,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.800
oh, yeah, this is all like just one big kind of evil empire, you know, that it's like, it's true.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.000
And I love the fact that Grush was able to kind of walk things back a little bit because

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.240
most people who have just kind of a fleeting interest in the subject think of Roswell as the

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.600
real start of, you know, possible reverse engineering programs when some people familiar with MJ-12

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:45.120
might think 1941 Cape Jurado is kind of the nexus point, but Grush walking it back further to 1933

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:51.280
Magenta. And who knows, are there possible cases before that as well, such as 1897 of Rora, Texas,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.800
or if the claims of Bob Lazar are true, a craft that was found in an archaeological dig and so

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:04.880
forth. Yeah, I think I heard really recently that, yeah, Lazar said it came from somewhere in like

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:11.920
the Southwest. Oh, did he? I didn't know he gave us. Somebody commented this a few days ago that,

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.640
yeah, he said something about, yeah, this is really new to me, that I guess, yeah, it was brought in

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.680
and they think it might have crashed like a thousand years ago or so. Wow, that I've been

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.320
kept up to date with the kind of, I don't know, yeah. And then the Aurora thing, yeah, I was familiar

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:34.400
with, I mean, you know, the airship stuff at that time. And even that's a funny one because it's like

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:43.760
the sink crashes into a windmill. Yeah, it's like, it's almost like, like, analogous power in a way,

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:50.480
you know, that, that if that was an airship, you know, and it's like, if these things are

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:58.960
constantly sort of like pushing us to, you know, advance our science. And then you've got, I mean,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:05.680
I've been reading more lately about radar and death rays, which is like pretty new to me, like

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:13.360
radar comes from the search for a death ray, which is basically your first EMP. Interesting. Yeah.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.520
So you've got like, Marconi, I'm gonna, maybe I'll do that tonight. Yeah. Marconi, you know,

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:28.480
Nobel Prize winner was put in charge of researching your experimenting on the magenta craft by Enrico

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:34.480
Fermi of all people who said this whole thing was kind of bullshit. With a famous Fermi paradox

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.440
that's very lacking. Turns out he said while he was walking with Edward Teller and two other people.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.360
So I think he was trying to throw somebody else right at Los Alamos. Yeah, at Los Alamos,

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.680
I forgot, I forgot about that part. Just learned that recently. But Marconi, you know, he invented

01:04:51.680 --> 01:05:02.800
radio. And then he was also known for studying electromagnetism in the ionosphere. And I'm

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.520
really, I don't know if there'd be any way to find out, but I'm really curious if he was testing out

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.280
his death ray and accidentally brought this craft down.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:19.280
Interesting. And for anybody who doesn't know, Marconi was implicated in the alleged RB33,

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.640
the internal Italian documents that stated he was kind of the basically in charge of

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.240
analyzing this craft that crashed in 33. And then in 2024, Panodi came out with more

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.720
documents vindicating the actual legitimate creation of RB33. So that is, that's pretty

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.120
interesting. Did you say RB or is it RS? It might be, it's RS. I'm sorry. I was thinking about the

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.400
RB47 jet while I was talking about that. Because it was a special research. Yes. Okay. Yes. Thank you.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.480
And so part seven, this piece was actually taken down. So what, what new, what? Yeah,

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.880
that just came down a couple of nights ago, because I guess it wasn't UFO-centric enough.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.880
What new points kind of, can you talk about that you talked about in this one before we move into

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:14.240
eight? I think, where did I end up here? Oh, right. I mean, this was, it's really ended up just being

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:25.200
about kind of the crossover between skull and bones. And yeah, there's a, you know, pretty famous story

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.600
about Prescott Bush was a part of this group that dug up at least what they thought. I don't,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.440
I think there were some, it turns out there was some dispute about whether or not it was really

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:43.200
him, but, you know, dug up the grave of Geronimo. Interesting. Yeah. Like, like had his skull

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:48.240
at their facility, you know, and just some weird black magic stuff there. And so,

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.440
you know, you kind of start looking at, and then, you know, they start Zapata oil,

01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:02.720
or, you know, Prescott Bush and Dulles, you know, start Zapata oil in 51 with the help of the CIA,

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.040
you know, and it turns out it was like a front for the CIA. But even that, it's like,

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.640
they were sort of like these middle fingers from these white colonizers. It's kind of how I look

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.000
at it, you know. And so, I think part of what's happening now, even just culturally in general,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.120
but let alone this topic and, you know, trying to reveal this true history is like

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:34.400
this notion of, like, ugly colonization before we go anywhere else, you know, before we actually go

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.800
to Mars and beyond, you know what I mean? It's like, we need to do away with a lot of that notion

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:45.600
of colonization. And so, I think you start to see, like, that's part of what this whole empire has

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:52.240
been from the beginning, you know, just like these white men with power, you know, who's hated more

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.520
on the planet at the moment, you know. It's like the rich white elite, basically, that have been

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.560
running things into the ground, you know, and so we get to see kind of where some of that starts,

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.880
you know, in the modern age at least. And then it's, and then I ended up on Bohemian Grove,

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.880
and it turns out it's all the same people, you know, it's like all these king makers,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:18.080
basically. And that's kind of the joke, you know, that, like, 36 and still Chill and I talk about,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.000
you know, it's just like, oh, yeah, this is what it is. It's just these people wanted to be kings,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.360
you know. And Bohemian Grove is similar to Skull and Bones. It's like a secret society that nobody

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.680
knows what the heck they actually do, besides do weird dances. Yeah. And they, you know, it's

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.280
worship of an owl and a bunch of other stuff. And we know there's like the Mike Cleland, you know,

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.520
owl UFO stuff. And, oh, right. And up Solica has talked about that. And so,

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.000
yeah, I don't know. I haven't read enough into it. I just kind of know some of that cursory stuff.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.520
So let's move on to point eight. I heard part eight. I don't know what dang thing about this.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.000
It, I hadn't read this. I asked you if it came out and you told me yes. So what can you tell me

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.240
about this? Because I think it involves a little bit of sort of like the black magic you were talking

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:10.400
about with the with Iraq and so forth. Yeah. And maybe, yeah, I mean, without having

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.880
predetermined any of this and kind of writing it out, you know, as kind of in real time,

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.120
I guess to go to, you know, to end up at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.480
and whatever they were doing there. And then to close off with like Stargate and the Tomb of

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.200
Gilgamesh. I mean, that was a thing that kept coming up. You know, everyone's been on the hunt

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:44.320
for Colt Hart's UFO too big to move. Right. It's come up a few times that, you know, the U.S.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:51.520
Embassy in Iraq looks like it could be, you know, where this all is. And then I think at some

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:58.400
points, you know, a couple of people brought up the fact that the Tomb of Gilgamesh was reported

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:06.720
found like barely over a week before we invaded. And there's some other stuff too I found recently

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.080
within like that timeframe, I forget, but some weird stuff, some business dealings and stuff. And so

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:21.280
that's why I was wondering like when specifically JSOC was set up. Oh, interesting. Like all part

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.480
of this story of JSOC is answering to Cheney. Cheney's the one who was basically running the

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.480
Bush administration. Just like Bush Senior was running the Reagan administration, you know,

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:40.160
the Bush family through the Western Company. Global Defense, which is under dresser industries,

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:47.920
is one of the contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Holly Burton famously was the big one. So it's

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:54.480
like these guys probably behind 9-11, let it happen. There's a famous, you know, they had a meeting

01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.480
that morning with the Saudis. It's the Carlisle Group in the Saudis. And then 9-11 happens.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.480
Didn't Rumsfeld, I think a couple of days before 9-11, talk about like two or three trillion

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.320
dollars missing at the Pentagon as well? The day before. Okay, day before. Interesting.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:19.200
Yeah, September 10. I just read that again. So you were talking about the Iraqi embassy,

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.120
I think even before Ross coming out and talking about the massive UFO buried under some sort of

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.840
construction, there were stories that the Iraqi embassy was built over a UFO, as well as other

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.080
stories in the kind of somewhat local area of the Middle East. There's some rich Munda stories,

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.160
like a 1958 crash retrieval occurring in Kabul, Afghanistan and so forth. So there's actually

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.000
a lot of really rich lore in the Middle East that I don't even think has been begun to be explored

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:56.160
until your piece. So yeah, I think part of this, so yeah, I've been kind of hearing that stuff.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:04.320
And then, you know, I haven't read either of the Skinwalker books, but I caught up on an older

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.840
apocaster a couple of years ago with George Knapp that kind of re-aired with, I think, on UAP

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.680
studies, you know, this was a couple months ago. But he basically walks through the timeline of,

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:27.040
you know, Bigelow and NIDS in the late 90s, early 2000s. And then you've got Bass, which is basically

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:34.560
where a lot of, you know, UFO reports and stuff are being sent in the 2000s. And then whatever

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:43.040
happens there to, you know, ASAP and then ATIP. And what really stuck out to me was that he said that

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.000
when Hunt for the Skinwalker came out, you know, that was Knapp and Kelleher,

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.920
then it got passed around to people at the DIA in the Middle East, like Likatsky.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.520
Interesting.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.680
And so you're like, oh, okay, Likatsky was working for the DIA in the Middle East in 2007.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.560
Maybe the year after we build this embassy and they're looking for stuff, you know,

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:13.200
like it would kind of make sense if that was all tied together. And also 2007,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.640
I don't know what he was doing, but Kirk Patrick was part of some joint CIA DIA operation.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:31.120
And I know it came out recently. I know Carl Nell was on like the first team

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.400
that went over there in 2003. And I think Elizondo was also on another like first team that went

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:44.640
over there. So I don't know. Yeah. It's just a lot of stuff around this. And then it gets weirder.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.360
So scrolling through the article, I see you bring up a picture of the alleged Holloman Air Force

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.800
base tape, which was actually just talked about by James Fox in his interview with Jesse Michaels.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.400
James Fox stated in one of his documentaries, he interviewed a guy that had seen this tape.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.480
What is the context here of including this clip or including this image?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.840
I don't remember. What did Cameron say? Something about,

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:17.760
because it's Cameron who's been tying Cheney into a lot of this stuff.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.600
But Carter knew what Cheney knew eventually.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:22.720
Right.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.280
I don't remember exactly.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.680
Okay. Yeah. You're talking about Grant Cameron and Jimmy Carter. Here we mentioned the story of

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.880
Carter crying. I still don't know. We still don't know if that's a legitimate story or not.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:41.280
She hand talking about Carter's election. Let's see if possibly under here. Okay. Jimmy Carter.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:50.320
Oh, oh, cool. Okay. Here. Okay. So Grant Cameron commented on this. So apparently this 15 minute

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.440
film was shown to Jimmy Carter. Grant Cameron states this. Grant Cameron is a fantastic researcher.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.280
And this film, without reading this clip just from my head, apparently shows a saucer with

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.880
three landing gear touching down, a hatch opening up from a smooth surface that doesn't show any

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.720
sort of view holes, port holes, signs of propulsion, all the classic observables of a craft. A sort of

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.880
runway comes down. Three beans come out. They look like tall humanoid individuals wearing headgear

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:26.000
that a film altars said looked like Egyptian headdresses. And so James Fox talked about this

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.040
video quite a bit in his recent interview with Jesse Michaels and said he interviewed

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.480
I can't remember the exact person. Yeah. I'm almost done with that interview.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.680
It's really dang good so far. Yeah. That's great.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:46.240
Interesting. So according to Grant Cameron, Carter had seen this footage. And in the footage,

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:52.160
I think like the beans basically start interacting with humans, which is pretty

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.800
darn interesting. It reminds me a lot of 1957. You know astronaut Gordon Cooper, he stated while

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.880
he was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, he had a survey team film kind of remote parts of the

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:11.680
base. And one of his survey teams caught a UAP landing that is same kind of saucer shaped craft,

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.320
I think 40 feet in diameter. And when his film crew got close, the saucer within 20 yards of the

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.120
craft it took off and he had seen this film and others had and then apparently it was confiscated.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.520
So that sounds very similar. I can't remember the exact date of this. 57. Okay. 57. Yeah. Then the

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.640
Edwards might have been 54. So these I think were within three years, these two supposed films.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.440
Oh, right. Yeah. Because 50.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:46.880
I'm trying to, yeah, put all this together. Because wasn't. Oh, right. Okay. Because this,

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:54.000
I think what I read and I mean, I don't, a lot of it wasn't verified, but I think there was talk that

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.120
what I knew of Kingman, I know you did your video, you know, which I think probably the best

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:10.080
one I saw, I mean, it was great too. You know, Kingman, the story that I understand is that

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:20.960
there were like eight craft and there were dog fight and one crashes into the side of a cliff

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:27.120
and it's totally demolished. One crashes into the ground. A guy's brought out to study it in

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:33.840
engineer. And I think there's a dead body, one or two, I forget. That was the Stancil crash.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.000
Okay. And then, and then a third one is gifted. And that maybe these were the,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.360
like Eisenhower was at all three of the sites or something like that, that it was like

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:55.280
the Kingman gifting was at one base, maybe at the Dugway site, which I know Greer's talked about

01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.720
a lot near Kingman. And then another one was Edwards and then there was a third one somewhere else.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:10.240
So that like one of these was the sites where possibly Eisenhower made his agreement and 53 or

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.360
maybe it was this before, I'm not really sure. Because the Kingman kind of the multiple craft

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.840
theory came from Harry Drew. And just like you said, over I think a week in March, seven days

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:27.120
in March, his documentary, there were three separate crashes, one crash, one forced landing

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:34.000
with which Arthur Stancil saw and one kind of gifted craft. Okay. Which is very interesting.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.800
And that documentary seven days in March or seven days in May, I can't remember, is almost

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:46.800
impossible to track down. I've never heard of it. It's a, Harry Drew packaged it with a like a book,

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.160
a limited release DVD. So I know a couple of like researchers who have been trying to track

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.520
down that dang tape, but nobody has found it. It seemed like that 53 to 57 region had a

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.040
time span had a lot of really interesting contacts because there's the Edwards Air Force Base

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:08.800
touchdown, according to Gordon Cooper. There's the, there's the Holloman Air Force Base landing

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.600
film according to Grant Cameron now that Jimmy Carter saw. And there's the Kingman crash all in

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.960
the span of four years. Yeah. Right. Well, and that's coming after 52, you know, which was

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.600
a pretty bonkers year as well. And 53 to start, we saw the Robertson panel as well. And 52 we see

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:31.760
UFOs over Washington DC. Right. Right. Yeah. You know, I've, I haven't read all of the

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.720
the Schellenberger document. You know, I've posted it a couple of times, but

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:46.080
every 10 pages, I'm just like, I cannot, like this is crazy. Like, it's, you know,

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:53.680
that's the, that's the timeline debrief for Congress, right? I, yeah, it's 177 pages or maybe

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:59.280
that's just the first document or something. But yeah, it's just like, Oh, another craft,

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.080
more dead bodies, whatever, you know, it's just like so routine for these guys, you know, whether

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.760
you hit the nail on the head, it's exactly 177 pages.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:15.600
Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's like every time I started to get through it, it just spun me out so bad.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.080
You know, it was like, Oh, this is just completely normal. It became normal, you know,

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:25.360
immediately after Roswell, basically, that like they kept finding, you know, these crashes and

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.440
these dead beings and stuff, and they didn't care. You know, they were like, Oh, okay, just like,

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.720
box them up, you know, we'll take care of them. Like, have you gotten a chance to read Leonard

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:39.680
Stringfield's crash retrievals parts one through seven? I know I haven't read any of his stuff yet.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.880
No, I'll, I'll actually send you the PDF of that. That is in is so consequential to my research. And

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.760
I think you follow the ufology in general, especially talking about crash retrievals and

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:58.560
the subject of bodies. It is so fascinating. And Michael Schrat, this was in 2016, I think,

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.120
was able to access the archives of Leonard Stringfield, who is now deceased in Cincinnati,

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.400
and made a whole nother series of kind of crash retrieval cases that Leonard never published,

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.880
including including discussion of the Edwards film as well. So there's a quite a tangible

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.800
research line for the supposed films of craft touching down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually,

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.040
I got to hang out with Michael Schrat last Sunday. Oh, did you? Oh, yeah, yeah, you told me. So I

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:33.680
joined the Hollywood Disclosure Alliance early August to try and reach out to producers, you know,

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.120
for documentary stuff. And so even that was like, Oh, I'm like emailing with Steve Bassett and,

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:46.400
you know, Dan Harari. And, and then they had an event last Sunday, and it was Thomas Jane,

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:55.440
Ron James from Mufon, and then Michael Schrat. And then we went to a dinner afterwards and

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.800
the location kept getting moved, just some weird confusion, I guess. So it came down to like,

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.000
eight of us or something. And I'm at this dinner table with like, Michael Schrat to my left,

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.200
Steve Bassett to my right, you know, Dan Harari right in front of me. And I'm just like, Oh,

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:17.280
okay, I guess this is my world now, you know. Now, did you get to talk with Schrat extensively

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.520
about crash retrievals? Because he's just so well versed on on that subject. What'd you guys get

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.400
to talk about? Yeah, I got to film in on magenta, because he didn't know any of the stuff yet.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.840
Right. He called me the next day, we talked for like 20, 30 minutes about it. And then he,

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.040
we were, he wanted to meet up today, but I was like, Well, I'm doing this thing.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:40.480
And so we take president over Schrat, I'm honored, man. That's like an hour from me,

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.240
it's fine. Yeah, he's pretty close. I know he's been looking for with his incredible drawings of

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.400
craft and sightings used like by almost every researcher. He's been trying to find a more

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:58.240
concrete description of the magenta craft to be able to draw because I think so the only real

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:03.360
description we have is from Grush, like a lenticular shape. Yeah, right, right. Two saucers

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.360
pressed against each other. That's slightly damaged, but whole integrity intact. Right, right.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.080
I mean, that's kind of what I walked in through and I was showing him,

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.360
I don't know if he'd seen the Daily Mail article on, on that,

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.440
it's the only big one that I've seen, but yeah, I was just showing him, I'm like,

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.840
I don't know, this is all I've seen. And so, you know, I know that and whatever Grush said, you

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.960
know, and so that's what he was trying to, you know, get down to is just like, what are the

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.480
exact dimensions? How exactly, you know, did it crash? I'm like, I don't know, I'll send you some

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.480
stuff. Still have all the way dating back to the magenta case, have you been able to kind of

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:50.800
tie in any of the mega defense conglomerates like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Boeing, Northrop Grumman

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:57.440
into, into your work as well alongside the EG and G Carlisle SAIC and some of the oil conglomerates?

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:05.440
No, I mean, that stuff has been even, yeah, too confusing for me just to understand

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.400
like the parallels, you know, between the defense contractors. I mean, I know,

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:19.280
you know, Lockheed works directly with the Air Force. I just, I don't really understand

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.400
like this, where the CIA, basically, I don't know where the CIA and the Air Force split,

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.920
because it seems like that's part of this story. Yeah, it seems like, yeah, especially

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.400
where's the difference, because there's a lot of joint teams in JSOC that can operate under

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.800
CIA's directive or any sort of directive. And the Air Force has quite a few teams, 24th STS,

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:49.440
the old classic blue berets and so forth. The Air Force is very interesting, but so is the,

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.800
also the naval involvement as well as outlined by Chris Sharp. Yeah, right. In his recent article,

01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:00.480
I think he, after his third edit, because I think there was some trouble with Dean, Dean Johnson.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah, but I try to extend an apology to him because I had talked about

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.760
the original edit that Sunday before any of that drama came out. So I felt bad if I had

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.760
implicated him in anything bad like the threats he said. Yeah, I'm confused though. I wasn't

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.960
paying enough attention. What happened with all that? So September 20th is when the article

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:28.560
is released. September 22nd, I did a live and I remember I had read the article when it first

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.800
the second it came out. And I was gobsmacked to see mention of the National Underwater Reconnaissance

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:44.640
Office of CIA, Office of Science and Technology, NRO, NGA, Lockheed Martin, and Woodsville Ocean

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:51.120
ographic Institute. And come the 22nd, that had been edited out. So thankful to the Wayback

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.440
Machine, I was able to talk about the original version of that article. And then that week on

01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.080
Twitter, Dean, Dean Johnson, I guess, called Chris Sharp out or something. And Chris Sharp

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.920
stated that he had received threats due to the original article. So he re-edited everything

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.360
out there and basically expanded on the fact or not fact, but the allegations that Woods Hole,

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:17.360
in accordance to kind of NRO, the underwater reconnaissance office, will retrieve craft

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.760
due to their very unique submersibles and then pass them on to the Office of Naval Research

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.920
for testing alongside defense contractors. Yeah, okay. Just another thing.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.640
Yeah, because I feel like for so long, the Navy's been overlooked in terms of

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:42.160
but going back to the nexus of like Air Force Regulation 200-2 and JANAP-146C in which the

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:48.000
USAF kind of restricted UFO reporting methods and like incurred a $10,000 fine if commercial

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.680
pilots reported UFOs, the Navy did the same thing with OPMAV 3820. So the Navy was right there with

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:58.320
the Air Force back in the heyday of kind of restricting UFO reporting. Gotcha. Okay.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.120
This is so bonkers. And then of course, there's corporations that tie into every single piece

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:11.920
of this, whether that's the Lockheed-Norton, SAIC, EG&G. Right, right. And I think, I mean,

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:16.640
that's the way we've all are in our little chat. Yeah, kind of been joking about it too, is just

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:24.160
like, well, it makes sense. I mean, all of this makes sense now. I think half jokingly to sort of

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:33.280
talk about a lot of this is being almost biblical in a general sense. There are these revelations

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:39.680
coming out and there's so much at play all at the same time. You know what I mean? It's like we've

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:48.000
got the craziest political upheaval we've ever had. We've got climate crisis. We just watched

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.240
the crazy flooding yesterday on the East Coast. Just so much income inequality and disparity

01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:02.400
and all these things and all these reckonings happening on a cultural level and socioeconomic

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:11.840
level while all of this stuff is happening as well. And it's almost like, yeah, the whole,

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:17.200
it's like this entire system has been built up. And this is like when it all kind of comes down.

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.320
This is the house of cards, basically. And so even to talk strictly about all the different

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.960
contractors, it's like this whole thing is so unwieldy. And like the way Dana Solika talked

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:37.600
about the Fight Club, it's like that thing's making more sense now. Just all these people

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:45.920
have it. Yeah, the picture of corporations involved in contractors as well as USG specific

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.880
three-letter agencies and USG military branches that are involved is starting to become a bit

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:58.400
clear. And it's been very fascinating to follow these revelations and see how a JSOC, OGA,

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:06.800
ONR, NRO, NRO, NGA and so forth has implicated. It's so interesting. I wonder if the magenta craft,

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.040
if it where it's being housed now, if there's still sort of efforts being done on it or it's

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:18.160
just kind of catalogued away and like an Indiana Jones relic warehouse. Yeah, I mean,

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.080
what was Birchhead's joke? Like every time you name them, the whole truck shows up.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:30.160
It takes stuff away. Yeah, yeah. I mean, my best guess is that initially,

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:38.880
it might have been taken to Oak Ridge, you know, because, you know, Vannevar Bush gets the memo

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:45.680
from, I think from FDR, from Marshall. I forget. There's some of the three of them are talking,

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.720
basically, you know, so he gets to setting up Oak Ridge, you know, and this is also following

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:58.960
the Cape Girardeau incident. So, you know, if they had everything, at that time at least, you know,

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.800
had everything in one place because there was no Edwards Air Force base or anything,

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.200
who knows now or any of this stuff is, you know. And I found it interesting in later cases,

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:14.400
especially in the 60s and the 70s, how often mention is made of kind of rotating warehouses of

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:20.160
where craft are stored. One perfect example is Kecksburg that is supposedly taken to Lockburn

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.800
Air Force Base in Ohio first and then shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. There's also

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:30.720
the testimony of an anonymous witness RB in Stringfield's files that talked about guarding a craft

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:35.280
about three hours outside of a base in South Carolina and that every two weeks, three weeks,

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:43.920
it would be rotated through. Oh, really? And also, in a project I'm covering now, there's stories of

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:49.680
reverse engineering testing team that's rotated through every six months for program security.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:53.840
So, possibly not only are materials transferred around and shipped around, but personnel are

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:59.760
too. But is that kind of an old method or is that still ongoing? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:06.320
about sight of things at all. I haven't heard any of that stuff. But it's just, what do you have

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:11.360
next for your research? Where do you plan on going next? I don't know. I have to like,

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.680
yeah, I have to figure out personal stuff. I fit so down this rabbit hole.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.520
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I've been looking into like the death ray stuff, which is

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:29.440
really interesting. And, you know, Marconi playing around with that stuff and Tesla playing around

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:38.160
with that stuff. And, you know, John Trump, you know, Donald Trump's uncle, who is basically given all

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:52.000
of Tesla's files after he dies. And at the same time, he was in like the x-ray business. And then

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.600
I think when it was announced we were going to World War II, he got into radar. And so it's funny

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:07.280
that he's the one who's given Tesla's documents, you know, Tesla was also like, if radar came from

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:13.520
the death ray, and that's what John Trump specifically was also working on, was radar stuff.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:19.280
But, you know, even the way like, if you watch like Simon Hollis, you know, that's kind of where I

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:26.080
sort of started locking onto that, you know, that like we understood more about radar early on

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:33.280
than we let anybody know that it was all derived from an F-ray. And it basically was like an EMP

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:40.320
early on. So, and then it makes sense that it's, you know, partly responsible for a lot of these

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.640
crashes early on as well, you know. Yeah, there's early stories, especially with Roswell, that's

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:52.960
some sort of radar interference, kind of a mess with a craft's inner circuitry or however the craft

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:59.200
are powered. That's an awesome rabbit hole. Oh, yeah, that's fun. Yeah. I mean, I was watching the,

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:05.280
I don't know if you saw the Falcon crew guys who got the part of the arts parts

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.440
a couple months ago, and we're testing it. Oh, they've done material, they've been

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.400
doing material analysis. A little bit, yeah, and they were super public right away, you know,

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.560
they were live streaming at all. But, yeah, they got a little bit of it anonymously,

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:27.040
and, or by a source who wanted to stay anonymous. And, yeah, I just happened to catch it that day,

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:31.440
and they were looking at it, and it matches up with so much other stuff that a lot of us have heard

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:38.960
about, like the terrorist waveguide stuff, and how it basically acts as a superconductor, and,

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:47.120
and it looks, it would make sense, you know, if it's like 3D printed material, and there's like a

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:54.640
lattice honeycomb structure inside of it. So it makes sense if like the power gets transferred

01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:02.560
up, it's like this really, like beautiful way, basically, that, you know, the whole thing gets

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:10.160
powered. And, yeah, it's pretty wild. I mean, I had, I had a sighting once that kind of lines up

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:16.160
with some of that stuff. Oh, would you see? I've had a few, but this was the closest one,

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:24.240
this was back in January, not far from my house. Yeah, I saw two, I'm assuming it was two,

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:30.560
they were in the clouds, and so I didn't see any like structure, but I basically just saw the

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:38.960
underside of like the, I'm guessing, like electromagnetic waves that were powering these

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:44.320
things, you know, and one was like this beautiful amber, and one was this beautiful violet, and

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:51.280
they were really close together, moving really slow, like, wow, do they have any like change in

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:57.840
direction? Could you see kind of a shape of a craft? I mean, they were saucer shaped,

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:05.360
but I didn't see any like hard craft surfaces or anything. They were like, yeah, just inside the

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.360
clouds, and I was like coming in from hanging out in my backyard and looked up, and right there,

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.160
things moved really slow, and I kind of waved and said hi, and they took off into the clouds

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.400
real slow, and I was like, okay. Interesting, now you said you could see kind of like an

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.800
electromagnetic discharge, what you, you could see kind of a visible wave pattern?

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:32.000
Yeah, there's a, I can't mean to find these and save them, there's two images I've seen, one is of a,

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:40.240
one went around a month or two ago, it's like a coin, I forget from where, but one side is like

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:46.720
of a craft, and then the other side is like a straight up reptilian, like smiling or something,

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:54.800
and there's another image from, like this famous historical image from Italy, from Rome or something,

01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:01.840
that's very similar to where the craft, it's like these grooves on the bottom, and so it kind of like,

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:10.000
if you can imagine, like let's say, eight or ten grooves on the bottom, and it's kind of like each

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.400
one had its own like energy field. Interesting. So all I could see was the energy basically.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:23.040
Kind of like of a saucer shape? Yeah, yeah, it was, yeah it was beautiful, yeah, it was wild.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:30.000
That sounds fascinating. And it was, I mean, yeah, and it was, I was having like a particularly bad

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.120
night too, so it was kind of funny when you talk about the psychic connection, whatever all of that

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.680
means, you know, it was kind of like, yeah, I was having a rough one, and it just, it was like,

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:48.800
came out from under my carport, and it looked up, and they were just right there. Wow. Okay, thanks.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:55.200
That is incredible. And I went back in and kept playing video games, yeah. Whatever, geez.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:02.080
Voler, I'll let you, I'll let you go now. I got a 20 minutes until a hard stop, and I usually do a

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:09.760
tiny bit of a Q&A right before, but real fast, where can you run through part eight real quick?

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:17.600
Yes, please, yes. Okay, so apparently the story of a Stargate was going around in the 1920s

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:23.200
in Iraq, and a lot of the world's rich and elite were kind of obsessed with it.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:30.080
Apparently, some of this isn't in there, apparently who Saddam Hussein found it in like the late 80s.

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:37.680
And so when we went to war in 90, that's a big part of what they were looking for,

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:43.840
Bush and Cheney. And I guess Cheney was like obsessed with the idea of a Stargate, you know,

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:47.040
and this like ultimate power and time and space and all this weird stuff.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.200
Some people have reached out to me to say that like when we invaded in 2003,

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.600
that was specifically, they were looking for that. And I think that's what they found,

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.680
purportedly, what they found in this tomb of Gilgamesh is this Stargate. And there was a story

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:14.080
too of, I think Russian officers in like 91 saw the US shoot down a UFO in Iraq.

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:15.680
Interesting.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:25.440
Yeah, so basically, yeah, it looks like that's possible. Stargate, UFO, whatever. I mean,

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.440
there's this J-Rod story in the Stargate and all of that. So, yeah.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.840
In part nine, we might see a further investigation into the Stargate because I

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.080
find that absolutely fascinating. I have a very amateur level of knowledge here.

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:46.000
So, it's just keeps getting crazier. So, we got part nine to look forward to and

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.600
the documentary you're starting to work on for Magenta.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.400
That's new documentary. Yeah, definitely some stuff about the death ray x-ray or death ray

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.760
radar stuff. I don't know. I haven't really thought it out too much.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.920
So, where, so Reddit and Medium under voller records, where else could we find you?

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:12.960
I started it about a year ago, losing my mind after Grush. And then my Reddit posts were getting too

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.240
long. Oh, wait, I think I lost, yeah. Where'd you go?

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:30.400
Oh, sorry. What was I looking for? Oh, my Medium is Escape Velocity.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.600
Escape Velocity. Okay, I have that in your Reddit posts in the video description.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.680
Okay, awesome. Cool. I know that we kind of glossed over some of the details, but I highly

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.000
recommend reading every single part one through eight and clicking through the links because

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.920
in every single piece you've made, you have linked a tremendous amount of third party research and

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.360
other avenues to go down. And that is my favorite thing about this research that nothing is just a

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.160
you saying, okay, here's an executive summary. It's the entire body of research with clickable

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.760
links. And people still complain. So whatever. I mean, I don't care anymore.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:14.480
You can never have 100. It's too many links. Hey, man, you know how many times I get people

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:19.680
calling me out of my videos for not pronouncing words, right? There will always be some level

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.400
of dissatisfaction. As long as you're putting together a cohesive thesis with supporting links

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.440
and an argument, I think you're doing a fantastic job. And these eight pieces I have learned so

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:36.800
much from. I think they're amazing. Cool. Yeah, lost my mind. Trying to get it back now.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.720
All right, Voler, well, I will catch up with you privately, my man. And thank you so much for

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:45.680
coming on the show. Once I wrap this up at here, six PM my time, I'll shoot you a text and we'll

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.160
talk a little bit more. Thank you so much, brother. I appreciate it. All right. Bye, brother.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.560
Yeah. Okay, guys, we're going to do 15 minutes of Q&A while I get Voler signed off here.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.760
Everybody, please thank Voler for coming on the show. He's done a tremendous eight parts.

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.600
It's incredibly difficult to try and talk about all eight parts he's done because this is like a

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.080
massive body of research. So check out all eight parts. We're going to do 15 minutes until I got

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:21.280
to get off of Q&A. Because you know, I love to do that at the end. If you guys will give me one

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:25.680
second, I'm just going to run to the restroom, put some questions up and I will get to them in

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:37.200
like two seconds. All right, give me less than a minute. I'll be right back.

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.740
You

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:33.120
know, okay, guys, I am back. So let's let's start going through some questions.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.400
One of my boys texted me said there was a little bit of quarrel going on in the chat. So if somebody

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:45.760
wants to enlighten me as to what was going on, let me know. Also, I just find the connection

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.800
of the entire Bush family to the legacy programs fascinating. I think this is an avenue that

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:56.720
should continue to be explored and I cannot wait. So I did miss a couple super chats,

01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.680
too close, two cents, fat rodents, Ort Wiener. Thank you guys so much for donating. I so

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.520
appreciated it. I didn't get a chance to look at the chat during the conversation with Volare

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.560
Records, but I appreciate him coming on the show so very much. I think those eight pieces are

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.440
fantastic. And I hope he makes a documentary on Magenta. Let's start with Big Dog. Yeah,

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:21.440
the Bush research is fantastic all the way from the Magenta crash to OSS to big oil companies

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.800
and so forth. So we'll start going through these. Zach, what's up, brother? Where do you draw your

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.280
line? Is open landing and contact in a military base too much fixed point out? It's like the same

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:43.120
time and location as Sakura. I'm not sure, especially in terms of the Holloman and Edwards

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:48.880
Air Force Base landing. It seems like a almost one off occurrence as far as we know of Fox,

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.520
not Fitz. Okay, okay, I see. Fox points out it's like the same time and location as Sakura.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:58.160
I still find it strange, especially the Holloman Air Force Base landing is almost an isolated

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.920
incident in which beans outright present themselves. However, there is one more story

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.240
of that I'm going to cover up in my next video at an Air Force Base of some beans who almost

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.320
willingly walk out of their craft and give it up. It's a story in one of Leonard Stringfield's

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.120
crash retrievals. It's very interesting, so I can't wait to cover that. So let's see.

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.000
Okay, you guys must be chatting about some in here. Let me know what you guys have been

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.080
talking about. Have I watched the X Files mythology episode? Highly recommend no, but I've

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.280
wanted to get into X Files, especially a couple cool people in my discord have been talking about

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.800
X Files and one of the creators I think Frost and how X Files may have had a little bit of

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:42.320
interesting inside tidbits in terms of this, in terms of their research. So

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:50.240
what's your opinion on Daniel Salter and the Accio? I do not know what the Accio is. So if ACIO,

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.000
I don't know if it's an acronym, so please fill me in so I can do some research.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.480
Have you had a chance to look at Larry Reed from Lockheed? You should try and get an interview

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.680
with him. No, I have not. I still want to get, I'm still trying to get in, not contact, but a

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:12.800
little more information on Dr. Jim Ryder as well. But Larry Reed is up there. Did I accidentally say

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:19.600
cover up? I don't know. Did I? I don't think I did. I need to fix the spectacles. If I said

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.720
cover up, let me know how I said it. The Iraq Gilgameshian Bible and buried UAP rabbit hole,

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:29.680
it's wild. I need to read the whole part eight because the tomb of Gilgameshian Iraq and the

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:35.040
possible embassy being built in that region because of some sort of UAP technology or tech as well

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.920
as Dick Cheney is really interesting. I'm such a novice here. That's why I was so excited when

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.800
Voler texted me today and said that he had this part eight out on Stargate. It's wonderful.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.120
Mentioned of X-Files and Twin Peaks, I think the same Frost, the showwriter worked on both.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.880
Let's see. Let's see. Everybody's loving Stargate is...

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.560
Okay, let's see. Sounds like you and Voler need to get together with some of the connections you

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.400
both talked about. I'm going to make him a chart of his names and dates and overlaps.

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.120
You made him something. I'd love to see that. That's awesome. I would love to work with Voler,

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:23.440
Kermit, Senior Trader, 3942, a lot of guys on a joint project because there are some amazing

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.480
researchers out there that the bulk majority of their work has been put out on Reddit. If I can

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.240
help it, I'll use the platform to let some of them come on and talk about their research like

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:39.280
Voler. I think it's fantastic. Fringe is better than X-Files. I've never seen Fringe, so maybe I

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:48.000
will have to watch that. Let's keep going through. Leave the Bill Herman abduction. Maybe some new

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.640
interesting abduction stuff coming up soon, guys. I've heard Stargate is a very good show,

01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:00.560
the original. I recently made an executive decision. I was between that and Battlestar Galactica,

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.960
the early 2000s show. I decided to go with Battlestar, so maybe I'll do Stargate next.

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:14.160
The first season of X-Files was based on RealPerson's FBI case, John Sousa. That sounds somewhat

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:20.400
familiar, but my recollection is failing me, so I need to do some extra research there.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:29.440
Okay. I would love to team up with Jesse Michaels and Danny Jones. We'll see about Jesse. We never

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.800
got to get together when he was here in Colorado. Just got to be a little bit too big, but he and

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:40.560
I chat often, so there should be some more time soon coming up that we can link up.

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:46.400
Sorry. Cheney must have met with analysts at CIA's WinPack many times leading up to the

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:52.240
invasion of Iraq, probably. Yeah, absolutely. I still find it so interesting that,

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.520
according to Voller's research, Cheney might have had a vested interest in some exotic technologies

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:05.120
that Iraq. Okay, let's see. After reading through Voller's posts and watching your vids,

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:09.520
is there any area you recommend someone to look into, something that is often overlooked?

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:14.400
Patterns with bodies associated with crash retrievals. I think a lot of the time with

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.720
crash retrievals, I talk about this a lot, people are afraid to go into the territory of bodies

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:24.560
because it's so contentious, and a lot of people look at it with such ridicule, but bodies are

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:30.480
one of the most fascinating and unexplored aspects of retrieval operations. Santiago,

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:36.080
have I ever played Halo? Dude, is that even a question? Halo reaches my ultimate gaming experience

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:43.440
I've ever had. I know Halo 3 is probably considered the greatest Halo game, but I will continue to

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:51.040
preach that Halo reach was the pinnacle of gaming. I loved that game. Okay, so the ACIO

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:58.080
Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization. No, I need to look into that more. Is the

01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.360
Looking Glass located at S4? Yes, Mr. Mozilla. According to Dan Burish and a couple other

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:09.280
alleged sources, Project Looking Glass is located at area S4. According to the design specs by

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.680
Dan Burish, S4 has five levels, with the lowest level housing J-Rod level, the level above being

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:22.000
like a crew quarter for testing the level above housing Project Looking Glass. Still, I get asked

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.600
this all the time when I look into Dan Burish. Probably at some point, but I got a lot of other

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:33.680
stuff first. The Looking Glass is pretty interesting, and there is a whole PDF. It's like a book.

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:38.160
It's called Project Aquarius that focuses on Dan Burish's claims in Looking Glass. I highly

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.080
recommend looking at that. I'll post a link to it in the Discord.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:50.080
I do remember Reach. Reach is fantastic. The final mission, Survive, is that can bring a tear

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.520
to any man's eyes. Did you know the CIA trains psychic spies to build mental protective barriers

01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:00.400
around CIA facilities to prevent remote viewers from spying? Yes, I did. I've heard about that.

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:05.040
I don't know specific instances, specifics, or specific individuals, but I have heard of that.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:12.320
The CIA and private companies research into psionics and psychic powers remote viewing is

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:20.640
something that fascinates me greatly. Could reported classified alien religious documents

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.800
be declared constitutional violation of freedom to practice religion by the Supreme Court forcing

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:32.240
disclosure? That is assuming that classified alien religious documents exist, which I think

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:43.040
that is alleged by Bob Lazar and the Reddit biologist. I think the two people who have

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:48.080
commented on that, if such documents exist, I think that would bring a lot of really interesting

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:57.680
questions on theology. Can you please never say scintillating again? I'm sorry, I just did.

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.800
But I'll try to. The word scintillating is great.

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:06.080
So something or someone says, I wouldn't say remote viewing is real. I remain

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:11.200
unconvinced. Okay, so you're talking about remote viewing. Yeah, I would also like to

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:18.080
see demonstrations of remote viewing. Very interested in it. Have I come across a lab

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:25.760
laboratory in Italy in my research? I have never, but that might be something I'll

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:29.920
pull over to a voler to look into in conjunction with the magenta case.

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.560
Scintillating. Okay, guys, at this point, you know that there are many words that I pronounce

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:44.080
absolutely horribly in the videos I go through and try to make sure I pronounce everything

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:50.480
correctly, but I will miss stuff. I just can't speak too well. That being said, the new video

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.840
should be here tomorrow or Tuesday. I'm thinking Tuesday to put some extra time into it.

01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:04.640
I really think you guys are going to enjoy this video. It is another primary investigation with

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:10.240
a ton of research put into it. The video I would liken it most to is the Off-World Technologies

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:17.840
Division. There are some pretty surprising research avenues here, so keep an eye out for that.

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.240
I'm not going to spoil the name or the subject of it. After that, we have another really cool

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:30.240
crash retrieval. Fire away the questions, guys. We've got a couple more minutes. If anybody's

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:36.400
got any more questions, maybe I'll give another hint to the next video. I guess I kind of

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:43.520
disclosed something. It involves mention of various Air Force bases such as Nellis. That's

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:49.280
going to be a cool one. I appreciate that, Hayden Pierce, even if I'm mispronouncing stuff. This one

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:56.880
involves the possibility of reverse engineering in various Air Force bases, most notably Nellis.

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:03.840
There was a reason that I talked about the U2 with Nellis and testing there at Area 51.

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:08.880
Area 51 is just northwest of Nellis at the Nevada Test and Training Range.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:17.520
I think in the comments, some of you guys are talking about not trusting Elizondo.

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.200
What have been some of the arguments for and against Elizondo in the chat?

01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:30.160
If you guys are talking about Elizondo, I'd like to see some of these.

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:38.000
A little bit of discourse in the chat. You guys, let me know what's going on.

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:44.960
I appreciate that, big dog. There's so many topics in this space that aren't covered

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:53.600
necessarily to a wide extent. As we see with Volor Records, research that even analyzing

01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:00.320
just a small case or an individual in their connection to UAP requires a tremendous amount

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:11.520
of research and diving into. You haven't checked the Scott Castle USO story. Guy says he has footage

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:17.520
somewhere of a USO. I'd be very interested to see that. I'd like to put some more time into USO

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:24.640
research, especially with the implication of Woods Hole, Neuro, O&R, and so forth. If there's any USO

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:30.800
videos, I would like to see those. The only USO related video I've seen was a Reddit post of

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.760
just some anomalous lights under some water. This photo occurred at night. I'm sure you guys

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:44.080
know what I'm talking about and have seen that. Guy says he has footage somewhere, a tail has

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:50.960
as old as time. With many cases, there will be alleged footage. That's why stuff like

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.920
Holloman and the Edwards Air Force Base is a bit frustrating because even though somebody like

01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.920
Gordon Cooper and accomplished Mercury astronaut will say that footage exists,

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:05.520
there's still no way to get our hands on such footage. Throughout Crash Retrieval's Parts 1-7

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:11.200
from Leonard Stringfield, there is also much discussion of a supposed alien autopsy as well,

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.440
some sort of lost footage. I think there was a NASA astronaut recently who mentioned seeing

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:24.480
some sort of NHI video as well. Were you talking about the story where a guy from the retrieval

01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:28.800
team asked a bunch of languages but the beans are just catatonic and walk right off the craft?

01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:32.720
Can I get the Stringfield PDF too? Yes, I will post that. No, those are two different things.

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:37.840
The bunch of languages is the infographics whistleblower who talks about the head doctor who

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:43.840
is fluent in Russian, English, Chinese, and other languages. He references some cases where the

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:51.200
beans found are almost children that can be led by pointing. This is a small story. It's a small

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.800
excerpt in Leonard Stringfield. I think it's Part 9 of Crash Retrieval's Part 6. Sorry,

01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:01.440
there's a bunch of parts in it. I only make mention of this because it is of important

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.560
contextual relevance to my case. I will tell you exactly where it is, Zach. Are you in the discord?

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:14.400
I'll post it there. Could there be a connection between UFO and the gremlins at the RAF?

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:22.400
The RAF Royal Air Force claims would cause trouble for them. Quite possibly. I'm not too familiar

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.160
with the claims of RAF and the gremlins. That might be something I have to look into a little bit.

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:34.240
Space Geek says, thank you for all your hard work. You have the most well-researched videos.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:37.760
I truly believe once the YouTube algorithm finds you, you'll have millions of subs very soon.

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:43.840
Thank you, ma'am. That'd be cool. I don't even know how to deal with 10,000 subs, let alone a

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.560
million. Boy, that would be a dream. I'm going to post the Discord link one more time, guys,

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:55.200
because Zach wants to hop in. Hop in the Discord if you want to chat about UAP during the day,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.720
talk about anything. There's some really sharp researchers in there, too. Really sharp guys.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:08.240
Zach just posted, Anthony, good show. Interesting links about EGNG, Carlisle,

01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:11.120
and various players. Thank you. I very much appreciate that. You have a story of Eric

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.160
Tabor, especially with EGNG. Area 51 is really interesting, especially how it ties into the

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:20.640
donation craft theory. That patch, there was a lot of controversy around that, because I think

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.440
Eric Tabor didn't think much about it initially, so he tried to pawn it off on eBay. That's why

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.760
there was a bit of steam when Ross Colthart posted the patch initially in his presentation,

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:36.160
and then it images surfaced of it up on eBay. That got a little hairy at one point,

01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:40.480
but that's a great story. Of course, Eric Tabor is a second, if not a third-hand whistleblower,

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.960
but still him talking to Arrow is still of consequence, and I still find that

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.800
extremely interesting and worth paying attention to.

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.520
You're talking about Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl talking about Gremlins. No, that's interesting,

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.640
but as a child, I loved Roald Dahl's work, especially the BIG. I'd like to check that out.

01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:07.120
Okay, what are you guys? We'll answer a handful more, guys, and then we shall sign off, so I can

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.680
also post some of those documents and so forth in the Discord. If there's anything I forget to post,

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:18.480
please just let me know. My mind's going a couple miles or miles a minute when we talk, so there's

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:22.720
some stuff I might forget, but I know I need to post for you, Zach, that specific excerpt of

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:28.240
Crash Retrieval's Part 1 through 7. I'll just post the full thing, and I'd love to talk a little

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.880
bit about Michael Schratz diving into Leonard Stringfield's work, so that's another one I'd

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.800
like to look into. Guys, if there are no more questions, okay, okay, upcoming vids you are

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:43.440
working on, any tees? Yes, I just did tease the new video that should come out Monday or Tuesday.

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.200
I will say one word, or I guess two words, and that is reverse engineering,

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:55.920
and I guess another couple of words, I will say Air Force Base, and this video has been

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.360
a blast to work on just as much as the Off-World Technologies Division. That's the sort of video

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:07.440
I would like in it, too. Big dog, thank you so much. Thank you. I really appreciate the support,

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:15.040
as always, man. And if you guys are arguing about Elizondo, Yuri Geller, how did he get

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.560
brought up, and other people do, I'd love to see it in the Discord or bring up the arguments. I'd

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.040
love to see what you guys are talking about, but with that, my friends, we shall sign off for the

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:28.160
day, and I really appreciate everybody joining. Thank you so much. The video should be out Monday

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:34.960
or Tuesday, and we will have a next stream on Sunday and possibly a couple other things coming

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:39.520
out in between then. But thank you all so much for joining, and I will catch everybody on the next show.
