1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
So Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from this material at a specific facility

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,680
that's known to me that I provided to the inspector general, um, like street address,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,680
all that shit, right?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,920
And the idea was if they made a catcher's mitt, a security catcher's mitt for this shit,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,560
you know, most serious set possible, the contractor and the other government customer, which was

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,040
the central intelligence agency, um, for that specific Lockheed material.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,480
And it was shit that they recovered from like the fifties and stuff.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,440
It was like bits and pieces of, of, of, of like hall structure or shit like that.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,200
How could in, so if an aerospace, and I've heard this theory from very informed people,

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
I don't think it's a theory.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,360
It sounds true that if there are crash materials and apparently there, there are those reside

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,440
in the custody of not the US government, but of contractors that work for the US government

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,680
aerospace defense contract, right?

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,600
McDonald Douglas, Lockheed, et cetera.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,040
My kids actually asked the same question and whenever I go on to business trips, I come

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
home to ask me, how are the aliens?

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,040
Did I see the aliens?

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Things like that.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
So yeah, do the aliens exist?

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,120
That's a question for another time, but in terms of what we work on, yes, we do work

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,440
on classified projects.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,600
In the field of ufology, Lockheed Martin, the US's biggest and most advanced aerospace

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,920
and defense corporation, has been intimately woven with the study of UFOs.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,720
From reverse engineering attempts to material storage, Lockheed's name comes up again and

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,960
again and again, and is specifically name dropped by credible individuals like David

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,680
Grush and Gary Nolan, who we just saw.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,200
My friends, let's waste no time.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,520
I am your host, UAPGurve, and join me today as we analyze Lockheed Martin's deep history

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,920
of UFOs and utilize facts and records to uncover this infamous piece of the military

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,280
industrial complex's true involvement with the phenomenon.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,080
In 2021, late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said during a New York Times interview,

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,560
quote, I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,340
I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,560
at the stuff.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,320
They would not approve that.

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,840
I don't know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,880
not give that to me.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Before we try and uncover what Senator Reid was referencing, let's review some of Lockheed's

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,020
accomplishments, so we understand just how advanced this company is.

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,040
With annual revenues around the 60s of billions of US dollars, over half of Lockheed's annual

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,400
sales go to, of course, the DOD and DOE, and has completed feats of military engineering

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,440
marvels, such as the creation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the F-22 Raptor, the F-16, and

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,000
the F-17 Nighthawk.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,280
Lockheed has also contributed greatly to the space age of man, creating space shuttle

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,760
propellants, designing manned maneuvering units for spacewalks, and landed key contributions

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,120
to satellite creations, and much, much more.

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,960
And we are all deeply familiar with the famed Skunkworks division that is intertwined with

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,840
DOD's special access programs, where top secret projects are conducted that result

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,560
in vehicles that fly at Mach 3.2 at 100,000 feet, such as the SR-71, or the production

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,160
of the first stealth fighter in the F-117.

51
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,240
But what about projects deeper, or in an even more classified setting than the already shadowy

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,760
Skunkworks?

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,880
Lockheed Martin is legendary for having so much lore and whistleblowers surrounding the

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,200
company's Black Division, but with an astonishingly thin paper trail and available evidence.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,920
You know me guys, we will do whatever it takes to critically analyze and separate fact from

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,720
fiction, but going into this know that we don't have the same sort of records available

57
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,800
to us as we did for Battelle.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,440
Lockheed Martin was not working closely with USAF and ATIC to investigate UFOs, and we don't

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,960
have an exact paper trail of when Lockheed got UAP material or craft.

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,240
So we will have to do our best to analyze all of the evidence.

61
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,480
We'll start by reviewing some of the perplexing claims made by actual Lockheed Martin employees

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,520
and head scientists, and yes, there are multiple and quite a few to review.

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,000
Most who are familiar with Lockheed's connection to UFOs know about Ben Rich.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,160
The second Lockheed Skunkworks director and the father of the F-117.

65
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,840
Just I'm sure as you guys know about his famed 1993 UCLA speech, where he allegedly stated,

66
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,160
quote, we already have the means to travel among the stars.

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,360
But these technologies are locked up in Black projects, and it would take an act of God

68
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,760
to ever get them out to benefit humanity.

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,600
Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm not here to push any unsubstantiated claims to back my thesis, guys.

71
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,040
So did you know there's actually no video or audio evidence of Ben saying this?

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,520
This is not to claim this quote is fabricated or that Rich wasn't interested in UFOs,

73
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,120
but these quotes are recorded by author Linda Moulton-Howell,

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,160
who is known to take some report of liberties.

75
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,400
However, this exact quote appears to be confirmed in a 2010 MUFON article by one Tom Keller.

76
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,560
But quite the contrary, on the 10th of July 1986,

77
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,800
one John Alexander wrote to director Rich to expand on his statement of being a, quote,

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,880
believer in UFOs. Andrew proposes that there are two categories of UFO and is interested

79
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,880
to get Rich's thoughts, man-made and extraterrestrial vehicles.

80
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,120
In a response letter, Ben Rich replies, quote,

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,720
Dear John, yes, I'm a believer in both categories.

82
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,000
I feel everything is possible. Many of our man-made UFOs are unfunded opportunities.

83
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,000
In both categories, there are a lot of kooks and charlatans.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,240
Be cautious. Best regards, Ben Rich.

85
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,360
Guys, please give me a congratulations for being able to decipher that cursive. It was not easy.

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,000
The only discussion I can find around Rich's mentioned UCLA speech are some remarks made by

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,840
MUFON director Jan Harzan, who actually attended the conference and can confirm some things that

88
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,120
Rich said. He ended his talk with a slide of a black disc zipping off an outer space.

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,960
And he ended it with these words, we now have the technology to take ET home.

90
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,760
And the entire place broke up laughing. And Tom and I just looked at each other and said,

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,720
did he really just say that? And are these people really not getting that what he's saying is real?

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,240
So someone else asked the same question. So finally he just said, he said, well,

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,600
he said, let me ask you a question. Do you think it's possible to travel to the stars?

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,040
He asked this about a particular engineer who had asked him a question about his career.

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,800
And the engineer said, well, I don't know, it just took a long time to get there.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,640
He said, no, it wouldn't. We've found an error in the equations and we now know how to travel to

97
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,720
the stars. So we can't really confirm or deny Rich's supposed disclosure, but we can say that he

98
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,720
did have an interest and understanding of man made versus non human intelligence UFOs.

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,600
And next we have Don Phillips, who was an ex Lockheed Skunkworks,

100
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,520
USAF and CIA contractor who told his story through Steven Greer's disclosure project in 2001.

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,960
And this is when Greer was still doing largely respectable work to push disclosure.

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,880
Phillips directly claimed that Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and quote,

103
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,200
tremendous technological advances have come from their study.

104
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,680
He also claimed in his interview with Greer, the US military did in fact acquire UFO craft from

105
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Roswell Lockheed, quote, really did put the technology to work. And Lockheed was intimately

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,200
involved with anti gravity research. All of these things Phillips claimed. But frustratingly,

107
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,720
vetting Phillips claimed background with Skunkworks and CIA has proved to be impossible for me.

108
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,400
The only mention of Phillips I can find is a paper clipping from July 29, 1965,

109
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,440
which confirms Phillips role in the Air Force as well as mentions him as a graduate of Pierce

110
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,960
College. And fun fact guys, this is the same college that we can actually factually verify

111
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,520
Bob Lazar went to. So analyze Phillips statements as you will. Personally, I view his role with

112
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,120
Lockheed from a skeptical lens. I need verifiable proof that his role within the company was

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,880
legitimate before I can judge more. However, some of the things he says about anti gravity,

114
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,040
Roswell and reverse engineering UAP technology lines up almost exactly with some of the other

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,320
gentlemen we're going to hear from. And next we move on to a controversial but very verifiable

116
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,520
figure, Boyd Bushman. Bushman's deathbed claims of working on UAP R&D for Lockheed released in

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:20,520
2014 and have become stuff of legend for UFO researchers. In this video, Boyd states that

118
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,880
debris and materials were recovered from crash recoveries plural in New Mexico, likely Roswell

119
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,120
and maybe the Kingman Arizona crash. He comments on the company's work with anti gravity and states

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:42,280
his work on UAP craft concluded that these craft contain three key elements in their makeup,

121
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:49,000
telluride, germanium and palladium. Worthy to note is that these materials Bushman suggests

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,600
comprised UAP could be used to create a thermoelectrical slash photovoltaic generator with a semiconductor

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,360
and capacitor as pure germanium was the first metallic material to become a superconductor

124
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,680
in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Palladium is crucial to capacitors and telluride

125
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,600
alloys have thermoelectric or photovoltaic properties. This isn't crucial to know you don't

126
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,720
need to be a material scientist but this sort of material science led some credence to what

127
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,360
Bushman claimed. Please feel free to view the whole testimony, of course the video will be in

128
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,560
the description but I want to focus on Bushman himself. Boyd is a verified senior specialist

129
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,440
and top secret SEI SAP cleared employee that served in Lockheed department 610-8,

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,040
the special programs division. In 1999, Bushman came under FBI investigation for suspicious foreign

131
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,120
contact. Lockheed became concerned about the potential of Boyd sharing sensitive information

132
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,680
with what appears to be contacts in Prague and it's unknown if all of this contact was UAP related

133
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,760
but from our investigation it looks like Boyd was contacting members in Prague to learn more

134
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,640
about anti-gravity. Bushman was awarded numerous patents including strangely in 1997

135
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,360
a patent for a device that creates a magnetic monopole beam that emits pulses, levitates,

136
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,680
degausses, stops electronics and separates materials. Monopoles currently are not proven

137
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,160
to exist in the public or physics sector and are an incredibly interesting topic. I recommend

138
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,720
checking out this video by PBS spacetime if you want to learn more about magnetic monopoles

139
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,080
but Boyd was the real deal right? Well yeah except for the alien bodies he showed in photographs.

140
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,440
The tiny looking gray creature can be traced back to a toy model originally claimed by an above

141
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:58,440
top secret forum thread in 2008 to be a Kmart Halloween decoration from the late 1990s. No

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,320
verifiable evidence can be drawn to the toys listing however this is not a great look for

143
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,480
Bushman. Whether purposeful or accidental disinformation I'm not sure but with the presence

144
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,720
of the two we are faced with three options that some government agency had some toy company that

145
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,160
made models make up alien toys that appeared similar to the real aliens that resided in Area 51

146
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,520
or Groom Lake so that if photos were ever leaked like they were with Bushman they could leak photos

147
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:35,080
of the toy as a way to discredit any whistleblower. Option two is that the photo of the model alien

148
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,040
was given to Bushman in order to discredit him and take away from his story and three of course

149
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,920
Boyd purposefully pushed the photo of the toy for whatever reason and now we arrive to the last

150
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,640
and probably the best and most credible speaker with regards to employment in Lockheed, Bernard

151
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,520
Haish. PhD astrophysicist Haish performed astonishing work for Lockheed including the

152
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,640
publishing of a paper for the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center with physicist Hal

153
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,120
Putoff. The paper focused on zero point energy of the quantum vacuum. The study specifically

154
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,800
looked at one or more resonant frequencies that may be associated with quantum vacuum interaction

155
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,840
for propulsion purposes. I'll mention this again soon so keep that study in mind.

156
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,560
In 2001 Haish wrote an essay titled Black Special Access Programs. He had created a site

157
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:36,040
called UFOSkeptic.org. Don't let this site name fool you he just wanted scientists to come together

158
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,480
to analyze UAP with a little bit more of a critical lens. To respect our time I am just

159
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,200
going to summarize this article I'm not going to read the whole thing but Haish essentially confirms

160
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,400
the world we came to know in 2023 with the revelations of David Grush that these black

161
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,840
special access programs on crash retrieval and reverse engineering can be quite independent

162
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,920
of any given administration and it's unrealistic to think that Freedom of Information Act requests

163
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,880
and even presidential administrations can penetrate and read into these programs that over time these

164
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,840
black budget programs become extremely independent and to trace their origin instead of intelligence

165
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,120
they most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition Technology

166
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,640
and Logistics. What is even more astounding however are the comments Haish made to the public

167
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,960
in 2018 after the existence of ATIP was revealed to the American public. He said quote the following

168
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,120
is conjecture sources tell me that this is merely the tip of the iceberg a group of four related but

169
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,400
separate unacknowledged SCI programs tracing back to a 1947 Truman memorandum still exist and were

170
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,320
housed as of the 1990s guys remember the Wilson Davis Memo and the reorganization of SAPs in that

171
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,800
time in major aerospace companies such as for example Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corps,

172
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,000
etc these would be expensive programs since the cost of secrecy can be several times higher than

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,480
research the ATIP program has no relation to these four much better funded deep black ones

174
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,760
indeed the black programs collectively have budgets in the 10 billion range and up topics

175
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,040
apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology the ATIP did find

176
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,240
the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels but was denied access to it because

177
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,720
ATIP itself is not a SAP. Senator Harry Reid petitioned the DOD to confer SAP status to ATIP

178
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,520
but the DOD denied his request and lastly guys while not a Lockheed employee let's take a look at

179
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,200
USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch. Fausch has made some astounding statements on Lockheed with

180
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,600
some really weird evidence to back it. In 1998 the Master Sergeant states he temporarily worked

181
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,720
at the Defense Advanced Research Center, DARSE, in 1979 which he claims is a facility beneath

182
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,240
Groom Lake with at least 10 underground stories. Fausch states he was recruited to DARSE while

183
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,080
working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. He claimed that triangular craft

184
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,000
had been reverse engineered by UAP contracted by none other than Lockheed Martin. The Sergeant

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,320
coined the now famous term the TR-3B which is synonymous with human-made reverse engineered

186
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,760
triangular shaped craft and states three prototypes have been reverse engineered by efforts at

187
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,680
Sandia and Livermore dating back to the early 1990s and was the first attempt at a gravity

188
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,240
warping craft. What is truly wild here is we can confirm not only Fausch's military record but also

189
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,360
the fact he was actually stationed at the famed Area 51. Look here guys Ed was assigned to Debt-3

190
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,120
AFFTC which is the organization at the Air Force Flight Test Center responsible for operations

191
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:01,160
at Area 51 Groom Lake but of course Ed's line because the DARSE, the Defense Advanced Research

192
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,400
Center is not part of DARPA right? Well look guys a declassified study from the Advanced Research

193
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:14,120
Project Agency ARPA shows advanced aerospace projects were performed by Warner Von Braun's team

194
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,560
at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency ABMA. A draft by the DOD directive shows the ABMA was

195
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,760
considered for a transfer into a quote defense advanced research center that would be inherently

196
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,120
linked to JPL. It's unconfirmed if DARSE was actually created and if any advanced

197
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,440
aerospace concepts from Von Braun made their way there but look guys DARSE is actually a theoretical

198
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:50,440
place. As mentioned by Bushman, Haish, and Phillips Lockheed has engaged with some incredibly

199
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,120
strange and exotic technologies that appear like they're straight out of science fiction.

200
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Can we confirm any of this work like anti-gravity or strange propulsion methods?

201
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:11,000
Well in 1955 physicist Lou Witten states that he was recruited by one George Trimble the current

202
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,160
VP for aviation and advanced propulsion systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company. The Glenn L.

203
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,640
Martin Company eventually evolved into Martin Marietta which merged with Lockheed in 95.

204
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,080
Anyways Witten states that he was recruited into the Research Institute for Advanced Studies,

205
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:37,480
the RIAS. Witten stated that Trimble recruited him to help develop anti-gravity and in 2013

206
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,920
actually stated that the team discovered techniques to harness anti-gravity in this project. Witten

207
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:51,080
suggested several ideas were tested including utilizing an isotope of bismuth but he does not

208
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,680
expand on this. And shocking enough we actually have the journal evidence to prove that this

209
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,800
research took place. And if you want to see Lou Witten talk about this look at the link I've

210
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,240
provided and go to about an hour 49-22. The anti-gravity rabbit hole runs deep way deeper than

211
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,680
the discussion by Bushman Phillips and Fausch. I'll cover this in another time guys because

212
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,080
the anti-gravity starting on about 1955 this research is fascinating. But remember how I

213
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,320
mentioned in 1998 Hesh and Putoff published a paper on zero point energy in the quantum vacuum?

214
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,680
If you don't know real fast zero point energy is the lowest possible energy level or ground state

215
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,400
in a quantized electromagnetic field which interacts with a physical system of particles.

216
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,640
In a quantum vacuum vacuums must always crackle with fluctuations in the quantum field that fill

217
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,800
these never-ending fluctuations imbue every field with some minimum amount of energy known as the

218
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,680
zero point energy. Guys you don't need to pay attention to that just know that this is pretty

219
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:01,560
breakthrough stuff but theoretically impossible zero point energy. But if you look to 2017 inventor

220
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,800
Salvador Pais and the naval air station were awarded a patent for a similar concept for a

221
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,800
triangular shaped craft that utilize specific frequencies to interact with the quantum vacuum

222
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:22,040
and generate anti-gravitic capabilities. Sounds like UAP right? Well on the 22nd of August 1998

223
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,320
now retired Lieutenant Colonel Ron Blackburn of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks and co-founder of the

224
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:34,680
ATP group at BDM International was awarded a patent for technology that increased aerodynamic

225
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,680
and hydrodynamic efficiency of a vehicle in motion that includes a sketch of a disc.

226
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,680
Several years later Blackburn states on a podcast he reverse engineered the capabilities to eliminate

227
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,880
sonic booms at high speeds by using videos of disc-shaped craft he had access to. Guys think

228
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,040
about this this has multiple of the observables of UAP by Lou Elizondo the ability to operate in

229
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,240
trans-medium remember the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency as well as travel at

230
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,200
mock speeds without the presence of a sonic boom this sounds like UAP technology.

231
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:21,320
Guys this is a UAP group video so let's analyze all the documents we can. Believe it or not Lockheed

232
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:28,600
has had some interesting encounters with official USG record keeping such as this 1953 UFO sighting

233
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,800
where Lockheed test pilots and ground crew observe a flying disc with anomalous acceleration

234
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,000
characteristics three men also swore this sighting as testimony the sighting was submitted to

235
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,960
bluebook but was never listed again curiously and guys think back to my video on the Wilson Davis

236
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,040
memo where Wilson Davis states the watch committee of the Black UFO crash retrieval and reverse

237
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,640
engineering program he discovered within the SAP logs told him they were almost outed due to an

238
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:08,120
audit well check this out guys on the 24th of July 1986 the director of the US general accounting

239
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,080
office GAO's national security and international affairs division Frank C. Conahan testified

240
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,080
at a subcommittee on oversight and investigation Conahan stated that Lockheed exhibited a poor

241
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,880
document control system over classified special access documents and had zero oversight from the

242
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,120
DOD program office it was then that the GAO stated the defense investigation service was

243
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,920
actually not allowed to conduct the semi-annual inspects of the aerospace contract in question

244
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:49,880
and 1460 discrepancies were found in an inventory of 40 000 documents with Lockheed an estimated 46

245
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,920
documents were destroyed and 17 were transferred out of the company and were never discovered

246
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,160
guys this sounds extremely suspicious the poor document control system of Lockheed and somehow

247
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:09,880
missing 46 documents and a full 1460 discrepancies well this strangeness and Lockheed's hand in deep

248
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,240
special access programs above even DOD oversight does not end here in June of 2004 former assistant

249
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,920
secretary of housing and urban development Catherine Austin Fitz wrote a paper titled The Black

250
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,640
Budget of the United States this paper says that quote a large proportion of the nation's wealth

251
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,600
is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels to support clandestine domestic

252
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,440
military r&d she states she discovered evidence that Lockheed Martin information systems were

253
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,480
responsible for the obfuscation of justice and may have data on the siphon DOD funds Lockheed at

254
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,160
this time was one of the subcontractors to IBM as hired by the Pentagon to manage systems that

255
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,240
failed a GAO audit so we have to think all of this taking place all of Lockheed's kind of

256
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,200
shadiness around DOD and mistracking of funds are they involved with the audit as spoke about in

257
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,560
the Wilson Davis memo and to add the icing on top here guys in 2000 commander Will Miller yes the

258
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,320
same Miller from the Wilson Davis memo told attorney Peter Gersten that senior government

259
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,680
officials such as a DIA director are isolated from UAP knowledge quote the keepers of the secrets

260
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:37,240
reside in DOD middle management and civilian contractors like SAIC Boeing and Lockheed and

261
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,760
are basically the comptrollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special

262
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:55,880
access programs black triangles are a legendary shape of UFO seen for decades and are the responsible

263
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,560
craft behind the 1989 Belgian UFO wave well what if I told you that there's a paper trail of evidence

264
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:08,920
that suggests this black triangle commonly known as the TR3B is actually a Lockheed Martin UAP

265
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:17,240
reverse engineering program called project Astra Aurora the first mention we can find of Aurora is

266
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:24,600
in the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1986 and 1987 where 80 million was planned to be spent

267
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:32,040
on an Aurora program in 86 and 2.3 billion in 87 for reference this was more than double the cost

268
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:39,240
of the b2 spirit bomber in fact in 1997 John Greenwald of the black vault inquired into Aurora

269
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,520
but was denied any sort of access then in the late 1990s we can go back to author Nick Cook of the

270
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,120
hunt for zero point who interviewed former head of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks Jack Gordon while

271
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,040
leading the plant in Palmdale Nick Cook saw a large chart illustrating the lineage of every

272
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:04,920
Skunkworks aircraft since the XP80 past the Dark Star which is the plane in the film Top Gun Maverick

273
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,680
there was something called Astra an ultra high-speed reconnaissance craft that looked triangular in

274
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:17,480
shape and it looked similar to some of the triangle seen in Belgium in the early 90s and when Cook

275
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,640
asked Gordon was flustered and denied Astra was anything but an old airliner and while we're

276
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,440
here let's not forget about the triangle shaped craft Fausch claimed Lockheed possession was actively

277
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,160
reverse engineering at Darse and do you guys remember the release of the Calvin UFO photo in

278
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:43,720
2022-2023 which was taken in Scotland and depicts a large triangle diamond shaped UFO that was

279
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,800
referenced by the British Ministry of Defense well if you look closely at former project Condon

280
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:56,760
that was the Ministry of Defense's official UFO investigation program the Calvin UFO photo is listed

281
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:04,200
as Astra slash Aurora photos among other 35 millimeter slides that don't appear on this last

282
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:11,800
file this could be very significant as in this same M.O.D. Condon report the Brits were interested

283
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:19,480
in investigating UAP sourced from USG contractor projects and this Aurora slash Astra may be listed

284
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,840
here was even more interesting to note this Condon report took special interest of triangle

285
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,600
sightings as seen here in the executive summary page of the report and it appears the British

286
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:37,800
had taken a keen interest in Aurora or Astra as a USG UAP triangle craft reverse engineered

287
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,480
because back in the 22nd of December 1992 the British Embassy in Washington DC

288
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,960
wrote to a assistant chief of air staff in London regarding the USG's reaction to triangular UAP

289
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,360
citing specifically a sighting that occurred three years earlier by a British royal observer

290
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:03,800
core member this investigation into USAF caused quote considerable irritation by the Brits and

291
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,200
the British officials who monitored the USG reaction are quoted as saying Secretary of the

292
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Air Force Donald B. Rice was to say the least incensed by the renewed speculation that he had

293
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,320
lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist so as we can see guys a lot more work needs

294
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,840
to be done investigating Aurora slash Astra but these strings connect triangular shaped craft to

295
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,680
both Lockheed Martin and USAF and that the British M.O.D had a keen interest in finding out what the

296
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,600
heck these things were. What's up guys I hope you enjoyed this look into Lockheed Martin and UAPs

297
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,200
as you can see after watching this video there are a ton of public figures who make

298
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,520
pretty bold claims about Lockheed and while these claims are most likely true as confirmed by Grush

299
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,640
and other key people it's really hard to actually get to the bottom of this if you see our paper

300
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:05,400
trail is not exceedingly long we have Lockheed Martin interacting with Blue Book in the 50s and

301
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,680
we have our audit trail that you know very likely is involved with the audit mentioned in the Wilson

302
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:19,640
Davis memo that the watch committee had to basically reorganize SAP status in the 90s to

303
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,760
hide themselves better but what do you guys think is is Lockheed as much of a player in

304
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,360
the reverse engineering and material exploitation of UAP as Patel I personally think so yes but

305
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,000
they are just a lot harder to track down as our nation's largest defense contractor I imagine

306
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,120
they have some pretty darn good record systems too keep stuff like this out what did you guys

307
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,280
think of the witnesses I'd say order of most credible to least credible we got Bernard Haish

308
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:57,320
Boyd Bushman and Don Phillips Don Phillips it's unfortunate I can't verify his background so

309
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,240
it's really hard for me to take his word as gospel Boyd Bushman a really interesting witness says

310
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,520
some interesting things but the toy alien I more analysis needs to be done there but quite frankly

311
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:17,080
I'm not sure where to go from there but in addition the Aurora Astra could be its own

312
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,680
hour long documentary but I just wanted to do a a summary an overview of what's going on because

313
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:31,720
there's a lot more to Aurora Astra including aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish seen something

314
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,160
called the TR3B or the triangular shaped craft in Lockheed Martin while leaving a facility and so

315
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,480
forth so there's a lot more to dive into guys maybe I'll do that someday but I need a little bit

316
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,280
more information on Aurora Astra some concrete information to make another video because this

317
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,040
video is a lot of speculation for for what I like pushing the boundaries of speculation versus fact

318
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,160
but this was an exhausting list of facts and data to make so please give a like and subscribe and I

319
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,960
will catch you guys on the next show and before you go in victory or defeat I support the best

320
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,320
athlete in the world Alexander Volkanovsky goodbye everybody
