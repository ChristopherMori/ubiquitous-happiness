WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
So Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from this material at a specific facility

00:05.280 --> 00:10.680
that's known to me that I provided to the inspector general, um, like street address,

00:10.680 --> 00:12.680
all that shit, right?

00:12.680 --> 00:17.920
And the idea was if they made a catcher's mitt, a security catcher's mitt for this shit,

00:17.920 --> 00:23.560
you know, most serious set possible, the contractor and the other government customer, which was

00:23.560 --> 00:29.040
the central intelligence agency, um, for that specific Lockheed material.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.480
And it was shit that they recovered from like the fifties and stuff.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.440
It was like bits and pieces of, of, of, of like hall structure or shit like that.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.200
How could in, so if an aerospace, and I've heard this theory from very informed people,

00:41.200 --> 00:42.200
I don't think it's a theory.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.360
It sounds true that if there are crash materials and apparently there, there are those reside

00:48.360 --> 00:52.440
in the custody of not the US government, but of contractors that work for the US government

00:52.440 --> 00:54.680
aerospace defense contract, right?

00:54.680 --> 01:00.600
McDonald Douglas, Lockheed, et cetera.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.040
My kids actually asked the same question and whenever I go on to business trips, I come

01:05.040 --> 01:06.640
home to ask me, how are the aliens?

01:06.640 --> 01:08.040
Did I see the aliens?

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
Things like that.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.720
So yeah, do the aliens exist?

01:10.720 --> 01:15.120
That's a question for another time, but in terms of what we work on, yes, we do work

01:15.120 --> 01:17.440
on classified projects.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.600
In the field of ufology, Lockheed Martin, the US's biggest and most advanced aerospace

01:22.600 --> 01:27.920
and defense corporation, has been intimately woven with the study of UFOs.

01:27.920 --> 01:32.720
From reverse engineering attempts to material storage, Lockheed's name comes up again and

01:32.720 --> 01:37.960
again and again, and is specifically name dropped by credible individuals like David

01:37.960 --> 01:40.680
Grush and Gary Nolan, who we just saw.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.200
My friends, let's waste no time.

01:43.200 --> 01:49.520
I am your host, UAPGurve, and join me today as we analyze Lockheed Martin's deep history

01:49.520 --> 01:54.920
of UFOs and utilize facts and records to uncover this infamous piece of the military

01:54.920 --> 01:59.280
industrial complex's true involvement with the phenomenon.

01:59.280 --> 02:06.080
In 2021, late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said during a New York Times interview,

02:06.080 --> 02:11.560
quote, I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.340
I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look

02:16.340 --> 02:17.560
at the stuff.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.320
They would not approve that.

02:19.320 --> 02:23.840
I don't know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would

02:23.840 --> 02:25.880
not give that to me.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.680
Before we try and uncover what Senator Reid was referencing, let's review some of Lockheed's

02:30.680 --> 02:35.020
accomplishments, so we understand just how advanced this company is.

02:35.020 --> 02:41.040
With annual revenues around the 60s of billions of US dollars, over half of Lockheed's annual

02:41.040 --> 02:47.400
sales go to, of course, the DOD and DOE, and has completed feats of military engineering

02:47.440 --> 02:54.440
marvels, such as the creation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the F-22 Raptor, the F-16, and

02:54.440 --> 02:57.000
the F-17 Nighthawk.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.280
Lockheed has also contributed greatly to the space age of man, creating space shuttle

03:02.280 --> 03:08.760
propellants, designing manned maneuvering units for spacewalks, and landed key contributions

03:08.760 --> 03:12.120
to satellite creations, and much, much more.

03:12.120 --> 03:17.960
And we are all deeply familiar with the famed Skunkworks division that is intertwined with

03:17.960 --> 03:22.840
DOD's special access programs, where top secret projects are conducted that result

03:22.840 --> 03:29.560
in vehicles that fly at Mach 3.2 at 100,000 feet, such as the SR-71, or the production

03:29.560 --> 03:33.160
of the first stealth fighter in the F-117.

03:33.160 --> 03:39.240
But what about projects deeper, or in an even more classified setting than the already shadowy

03:39.240 --> 03:40.760
Skunkworks?

03:40.840 --> 03:45.880
Lockheed Martin is legendary for having so much lore and whistleblowers surrounding the

03:45.880 --> 03:52.200
company's Black Division, but with an astonishingly thin paper trail and available evidence.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.920
You know me guys, we will do whatever it takes to critically analyze and separate fact from

03:56.920 --> 04:01.720
fiction, but going into this know that we don't have the same sort of records available

04:01.720 --> 04:03.800
to us as we did for Battelle.

04:03.800 --> 04:10.440
Lockheed Martin was not working closely with USAF and ATIC to investigate UFOs, and we don't

04:10.440 --> 04:15.960
have an exact paper trail of when Lockheed got UAP material or craft.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.240
So we will have to do our best to analyze all of the evidence.

04:23.640 --> 04:29.480
We'll start by reviewing some of the perplexing claims made by actual Lockheed Martin employees

04:29.480 --> 04:34.520
and head scientists, and yes, there are multiple and quite a few to review.

04:34.520 --> 04:39.000
Most who are familiar with Lockheed's connection to UFOs know about Ben Rich.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.160
The second Lockheed Skunkworks director and the father of the F-117.

04:43.880 --> 04:50.840
Just I'm sure as you guys know about his famed 1993 UCLA speech, where he allegedly stated,

04:50.840 --> 04:55.160
quote, we already have the means to travel among the stars.

04:55.160 --> 05:00.360
But these technologies are locked up in Black projects, and it would take an act of God

05:00.360 --> 05:02.760
to ever get them out to benefit humanity.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.600
Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.

05:07.320 --> 05:12.360
I'm not here to push any unsubstantiated claims to back my thesis, guys.

05:12.360 --> 05:18.040
So did you know there's actually no video or audio evidence of Ben saying this?

05:18.040 --> 05:22.520
This is not to claim this quote is fabricated or that Rich wasn't interested in UFOs,

05:23.080 --> 05:26.120
but these quotes are recorded by author Linda Moulton-Howell,

05:26.120 --> 05:29.160
who is known to take some report of liberties.

05:29.160 --> 05:35.400
However, this exact quote appears to be confirmed in a 2010 MUFON article by one Tom Keller.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.560
But quite the contrary, on the 10th of July 1986,

05:40.360 --> 05:45.800
one John Alexander wrote to director Rich to expand on his statement of being a, quote,

05:45.800 --> 05:51.880
believer in UFOs. Andrew proposes that there are two categories of UFO and is interested

05:51.880 --> 05:55.880
to get Rich's thoughts, man-made and extraterrestrial vehicles.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.120
In a response letter, Ben Rich replies, quote,

06:00.120 --> 06:03.720
Dear John, yes, I'm a believer in both categories.

06:04.360 --> 06:09.000
I feel everything is possible. Many of our man-made UFOs are unfunded opportunities.

06:09.720 --> 06:13.000
In both categories, there are a lot of kooks and charlatans.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.240
Be cautious. Best regards, Ben Rich.

06:15.800 --> 06:20.360
Guys, please give me a congratulations for being able to decipher that cursive. It was not easy.

06:21.400 --> 06:27.000
The only discussion I can find around Rich's mentioned UCLA speech are some remarks made by

06:27.080 --> 06:32.840
MUFON director Jan Harzan, who actually attended the conference and can confirm some things that

06:32.840 --> 06:38.120
Rich said. He ended his talk with a slide of a black disc zipping off an outer space.

06:38.920 --> 06:43.960
And he ended it with these words, we now have the technology to take ET home.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.760
And the entire place broke up laughing. And Tom and I just looked at each other and said,

06:48.760 --> 06:53.720
did he really just say that? And are these people really not getting that what he's saying is real?

06:53.720 --> 06:57.240
So someone else asked the same question. So finally he just said, he said, well,

06:57.240 --> 07:00.600
he said, let me ask you a question. Do you think it's possible to travel to the stars?

07:01.160 --> 07:04.040
He asked this about a particular engineer who had asked him a question about his career.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.800
And the engineer said, well, I don't know, it just took a long time to get there.

07:07.800 --> 07:13.640
He said, no, it wouldn't. We've found an error in the equations and we now know how to travel to

07:13.640 --> 07:19.720
the stars. So we can't really confirm or deny Rich's supposed disclosure, but we can say that he

07:19.720 --> 07:25.720
did have an interest and understanding of man made versus non human intelligence UFOs.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.600
And next we have Don Phillips, who was an ex Lockheed Skunkworks,

07:30.600 --> 07:36.520
USAF and CIA contractor who told his story through Steven Greer's disclosure project in 2001.

07:37.400 --> 07:41.960
And this is when Greer was still doing largely respectable work to push disclosure.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.880
Phillips directly claimed that Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and quote,

07:47.880 --> 07:52.200
tremendous technological advances have come from their study.

07:52.200 --> 07:58.680
He also claimed in his interview with Greer, the US military did in fact acquire UFO craft from

07:58.680 --> 08:06.040
Roswell Lockheed, quote, really did put the technology to work. And Lockheed was intimately

08:06.040 --> 08:12.200
involved with anti gravity research. All of these things Phillips claimed. But frustratingly,

08:12.760 --> 08:17.720
vetting Phillips claimed background with Skunkworks and CIA has proved to be impossible for me.

08:18.280 --> 08:25.400
The only mention of Phillips I can find is a paper clipping from July 29, 1965,

08:25.400 --> 08:30.440
which confirms Phillips role in the Air Force as well as mentions him as a graduate of Pierce

08:30.440 --> 08:35.960
College. And fun fact guys, this is the same college that we can actually factually verify

08:35.960 --> 08:42.520
Bob Lazar went to. So analyze Phillips statements as you will. Personally, I view his role with

08:42.520 --> 08:48.120
Lockheed from a skeptical lens. I need verifiable proof that his role within the company was

08:48.120 --> 08:53.880
legitimate before I can judge more. However, some of the things he says about anti gravity,

08:53.880 --> 09:00.040
Roswell and reverse engineering UAP technology lines up almost exactly with some of the other

09:00.040 --> 09:05.320
gentlemen we're going to hear from. And next we move on to a controversial but very verifiable

09:05.400 --> 09:12.520
figure, Boyd Bushman. Bushman's deathbed claims of working on UAP R&D for Lockheed released in

09:12.520 --> 09:20.520
2014 and have become stuff of legend for UFO researchers. In this video, Boyd states that

09:20.520 --> 09:27.880
debris and materials were recovered from crash recoveries plural in New Mexico, likely Roswell

09:27.880 --> 09:34.120
and maybe the Kingman Arizona crash. He comments on the company's work with anti gravity and states

09:34.120 --> 09:42.280
his work on UAP craft concluded that these craft contain three key elements in their makeup,

09:42.280 --> 09:49.000
telluride, germanium and palladium. Worthy to note is that these materials Bushman suggests

09:49.000 --> 09:56.600
comprised UAP could be used to create a thermoelectrical slash photovoltaic generator with a semiconductor

09:56.600 --> 10:02.360
and capacitor as pure germanium was the first metallic material to become a superconductor

10:02.360 --> 10:08.680
in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Palladium is crucial to capacitors and telluride

10:08.680 --> 10:14.600
alloys have thermoelectric or photovoltaic properties. This isn't crucial to know you don't

10:14.600 --> 10:19.720
need to be a material scientist but this sort of material science led some credence to what

10:19.720 --> 10:24.360
Bushman claimed. Please feel free to view the whole testimony, of course the video will be in

10:24.360 --> 10:31.560
the description but I want to focus on Bushman himself. Boyd is a verified senior specialist

10:31.640 --> 10:38.440
and top secret SEI SAP cleared employee that served in Lockheed department 610-8,

10:38.440 --> 10:46.040
the special programs division. In 1999, Bushman came under FBI investigation for suspicious foreign

10:46.040 --> 10:52.120
contact. Lockheed became concerned about the potential of Boyd sharing sensitive information

10:52.120 --> 10:58.680
with what appears to be contacts in Prague and it's unknown if all of this contact was UAP related

10:59.640 --> 11:04.760
but from our investigation it looks like Boyd was contacting members in Prague to learn more

11:04.760 --> 11:11.640
about anti-gravity. Bushman was awarded numerous patents including strangely in 1997

11:12.360 --> 11:18.360
a patent for a device that creates a magnetic monopole beam that emits pulses, levitates,

11:18.360 --> 11:24.680
degausses, stops electronics and separates materials. Monopoles currently are not proven

11:24.680 --> 11:31.160
to exist in the public or physics sector and are an incredibly interesting topic. I recommend

11:31.160 --> 11:35.720
checking out this video by PBS spacetime if you want to learn more about magnetic monopoles

11:36.360 --> 11:43.080
but Boyd was the real deal right? Well yeah except for the alien bodies he showed in photographs.

11:43.960 --> 11:50.440
The tiny looking gray creature can be traced back to a toy model originally claimed by an above

11:50.520 --> 11:58.440
top secret forum thread in 2008 to be a Kmart Halloween decoration from the late 1990s. No

11:58.440 --> 12:03.320
verifiable evidence can be drawn to the toys listing however this is not a great look for

12:03.320 --> 12:09.480
Bushman. Whether purposeful or accidental disinformation I'm not sure but with the presence

12:09.480 --> 12:15.720
of the two we are faced with three options that some government agency had some toy company that

12:15.720 --> 12:23.160
made models make up alien toys that appeared similar to the real aliens that resided in Area 51

12:23.160 --> 12:28.520
or Groom Lake so that if photos were ever leaked like they were with Bushman they could leak photos

12:28.520 --> 12:35.080
of the toy as a way to discredit any whistleblower. Option two is that the photo of the model alien

12:35.080 --> 12:40.040
was given to Bushman in order to discredit him and take away from his story and three of course

12:40.840 --> 12:46.920
Boyd purposefully pushed the photo of the toy for whatever reason and now we arrive to the last

12:46.920 --> 12:51.640
and probably the best and most credible speaker with regards to employment in Lockheed, Bernard

12:51.640 --> 12:58.520
Haish. PhD astrophysicist Haish performed astonishing work for Lockheed including the

12:58.520 --> 13:03.640
publishing of a paper for the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center with physicist Hal

13:03.640 --> 13:10.120
Putoff. The paper focused on zero point energy of the quantum vacuum. The study specifically

13:10.120 --> 13:15.800
looked at one or more resonant frequencies that may be associated with quantum vacuum interaction

13:15.800 --> 13:20.840
for propulsion purposes. I'll mention this again soon so keep that study in mind.

13:21.720 --> 13:29.560
In 2001 Haish wrote an essay titled Black Special Access Programs. He had created a site

13:29.560 --> 13:36.040
called UFOSkeptic.org. Don't let this site name fool you he just wanted scientists to come together

13:36.040 --> 13:41.480
to analyze UAP with a little bit more of a critical lens. To respect our time I am just

13:41.480 --> 13:46.200
going to summarize this article I'm not going to read the whole thing but Haish essentially confirms

13:46.200 --> 13:51.400
the world we came to know in 2023 with the revelations of David Grush that these black

13:51.400 --> 13:56.840
special access programs on crash retrieval and reverse engineering can be quite independent

13:56.840 --> 14:02.920
of any given administration and it's unrealistic to think that Freedom of Information Act requests

14:02.920 --> 14:09.880
and even presidential administrations can penetrate and read into these programs that over time these

14:09.880 --> 14:16.840
black budget programs become extremely independent and to trace their origin instead of intelligence

14:16.840 --> 14:22.120
they most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition Technology

14:22.120 --> 14:27.640
and Logistics. What is even more astounding however are the comments Haish made to the public

14:27.640 --> 14:33.960
in 2018 after the existence of ATIP was revealed to the American public. He said quote the following

14:33.960 --> 14:40.120
is conjecture sources tell me that this is merely the tip of the iceberg a group of four related but

14:40.120 --> 14:47.400
separate unacknowledged SCI programs tracing back to a 1947 Truman memorandum still exist and were

14:47.400 --> 14:53.320
housed as of the 1990s guys remember the Wilson Davis Memo and the reorganization of SAPs in that

14:53.320 --> 14:59.800
time in major aerospace companies such as for example Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corps,

14:59.800 --> 15:05.000
etc these would be expensive programs since the cost of secrecy can be several times higher than

15:05.000 --> 15:11.480
research the ATIP program has no relation to these four much better funded deep black ones

15:11.480 --> 15:16.760
indeed the black programs collectively have budgets in the 10 billion range and up topics

15:16.760 --> 15:22.040
apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology the ATIP did find

15:22.040 --> 15:27.240
the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels but was denied access to it because

15:27.240 --> 15:33.720
ATIP itself is not a SAP. Senator Harry Reid petitioned the DOD to confer SAP status to ATIP

15:33.720 --> 15:40.520
but the DOD denied his request and lastly guys while not a Lockheed employee let's take a look at

15:40.520 --> 15:46.200
USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch. Fausch has made some astounding statements on Lockheed with

15:46.200 --> 15:52.600
some really weird evidence to back it. In 1998 the Master Sergeant states he temporarily worked

15:52.600 --> 15:59.720
at the Defense Advanced Research Center, DARSE, in 1979 which he claims is a facility beneath

15:59.720 --> 16:05.240
Groom Lake with at least 10 underground stories. Fausch states he was recruited to DARSE while

16:05.240 --> 16:11.080
working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. He claimed that triangular craft

16:11.080 --> 16:17.000
had been reverse engineered by UAP contracted by none other than Lockheed Martin. The Sergeant

16:17.000 --> 16:23.320
coined the now famous term the TR-3B which is synonymous with human-made reverse engineered

16:23.320 --> 16:28.760
triangular shaped craft and states three prototypes have been reverse engineered by efforts at

16:28.760 --> 16:34.680
Sandia and Livermore dating back to the early 1990s and was the first attempt at a gravity

16:34.680 --> 16:41.240
warping craft. What is truly wild here is we can confirm not only Fausch's military record but also

16:41.240 --> 16:48.360
the fact he was actually stationed at the famed Area 51. Look here guys Ed was assigned to Debt-3

16:48.360 --> 16:54.120
AFFTC which is the organization at the Air Force Flight Test Center responsible for operations

16:54.120 --> 17:01.160
at Area 51 Groom Lake but of course Ed's line because the DARSE, the Defense Advanced Research

17:01.160 --> 17:07.400
Center is not part of DARPA right? Well look guys a declassified study from the Advanced Research

17:07.400 --> 17:14.120
Project Agency ARPA shows advanced aerospace projects were performed by Warner Von Braun's team

17:14.120 --> 17:21.560
at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency ABMA. A draft by the DOD directive shows the ABMA was

17:21.560 --> 17:28.760
considered for a transfer into a quote defense advanced research center that would be inherently

17:28.760 --> 17:34.120
linked to JPL. It's unconfirmed if DARSE was actually created and if any advanced

17:34.120 --> 17:40.440
aerospace concepts from Von Braun made their way there but look guys DARSE is actually a theoretical

17:40.440 --> 17:50.440
place. As mentioned by Bushman, Haish, and Phillips Lockheed has engaged with some incredibly

17:50.440 --> 17:56.120
strange and exotic technologies that appear like they're straight out of science fiction.

17:56.120 --> 18:02.280
Can we confirm any of this work like anti-gravity or strange propulsion methods?

18:03.080 --> 18:11.000
Well in 1955 physicist Lou Witten states that he was recruited by one George Trimble the current

18:11.000 --> 18:17.160
VP for aviation and advanced propulsion systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company. The Glenn L.

18:17.160 --> 18:23.640
Martin Company eventually evolved into Martin Marietta which merged with Lockheed in 95.

18:23.640 --> 18:29.080
Anyways Witten states that he was recruited into the Research Institute for Advanced Studies,

18:29.080 --> 18:37.480
the RIAS. Witten stated that Trimble recruited him to help develop anti-gravity and in 2013

18:37.480 --> 18:44.920
actually stated that the team discovered techniques to harness anti-gravity in this project. Witten

18:44.920 --> 18:51.080
suggested several ideas were tested including utilizing an isotope of bismuth but he does not

18:51.080 --> 18:56.680
expand on this. And shocking enough we actually have the journal evidence to prove that this

18:56.680 --> 19:01.800
research took place. And if you want to see Lou Witten talk about this look at the link I've

19:01.800 --> 19:09.240
provided and go to about an hour 49-22. The anti-gravity rabbit hole runs deep way deeper than

19:09.240 --> 19:14.680
the discussion by Bushman Phillips and Fausch. I'll cover this in another time guys because

19:14.680 --> 19:21.080
the anti-gravity starting on about 1955 this research is fascinating. But remember how I

19:21.080 --> 19:27.320
mentioned in 1998 Hesh and Putoff published a paper on zero point energy in the quantum vacuum?

19:27.320 --> 19:32.680
If you don't know real fast zero point energy is the lowest possible energy level or ground state

19:32.680 --> 19:37.400
in a quantized electromagnetic field which interacts with a physical system of particles.

19:38.040 --> 19:43.640
In a quantum vacuum vacuums must always crackle with fluctuations in the quantum field that fill

19:44.040 --> 19:49.800
these never-ending fluctuations imbue every field with some minimum amount of energy known as the

19:49.800 --> 19:54.680
zero point energy. Guys you don't need to pay attention to that just know that this is pretty

19:54.680 --> 20:01.560
breakthrough stuff but theoretically impossible zero point energy. But if you look to 2017 inventor

20:01.560 --> 20:07.800
Salvador Pais and the naval air station were awarded a patent for a similar concept for a

20:07.800 --> 20:13.800
triangular shaped craft that utilize specific frequencies to interact with the quantum vacuum

20:13.800 --> 20:22.040
and generate anti-gravitic capabilities. Sounds like UAP right? Well on the 22nd of August 1998

20:22.040 --> 20:27.320
now retired Lieutenant Colonel Ron Blackburn of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks and co-founder of the

20:27.320 --> 20:34.680
ATP group at BDM International was awarded a patent for technology that increased aerodynamic

20:34.680 --> 20:40.680
and hydrodynamic efficiency of a vehicle in motion that includes a sketch of a disc.

20:41.320 --> 20:46.680
Several years later Blackburn states on a podcast he reverse engineered the capabilities to eliminate

20:46.680 --> 20:53.880
sonic booms at high speeds by using videos of disc-shaped craft he had access to. Guys think

20:53.880 --> 21:00.040
about this this has multiple of the observables of UAP by Lou Elizondo the ability to operate in

21:00.040 --> 21:05.240
trans-medium remember the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency as well as travel at

21:05.240 --> 21:10.200
mock speeds without the presence of a sonic boom this sounds like UAP technology.

21:14.760 --> 21:21.320
Guys this is a UAP group video so let's analyze all the documents we can. Believe it or not Lockheed

21:21.320 --> 21:28.600
has had some interesting encounters with official USG record keeping such as this 1953 UFO sighting

21:28.680 --> 21:33.800
where Lockheed test pilots and ground crew observe a flying disc with anomalous acceleration

21:33.800 --> 21:41.000
characteristics three men also swore this sighting as testimony the sighting was submitted to

21:41.000 --> 21:47.960
bluebook but was never listed again curiously and guys think back to my video on the Wilson Davis

21:47.960 --> 21:54.040
memo where Wilson Davis states the watch committee of the Black UFO crash retrieval and reverse

21:54.040 --> 21:59.640
engineering program he discovered within the SAP logs told him they were almost outed due to an

21:59.640 --> 22:08.120
audit well check this out guys on the 24th of July 1986 the director of the US general accounting

22:08.120 --> 22:15.080
office GAO's national security and international affairs division Frank C. Conahan testified

22:15.080 --> 22:21.080
at a subcommittee on oversight and investigation Conahan stated that Lockheed exhibited a poor

22:21.080 --> 22:27.880
document control system over classified special access documents and had zero oversight from the

22:27.880 --> 22:34.120
DOD program office it was then that the GAO stated the defense investigation service was

22:34.120 --> 22:40.920
actually not allowed to conduct the semi-annual inspects of the aerospace contract in question

22:40.920 --> 22:49.880
and 1460 discrepancies were found in an inventory of 40 000 documents with Lockheed an estimated 46

22:49.880 --> 22:54.920
documents were destroyed and 17 were transferred out of the company and were never discovered

22:55.640 --> 23:01.160
guys this sounds extremely suspicious the poor document control system of Lockheed and somehow

23:01.160 --> 23:09.880
missing 46 documents and a full 1460 discrepancies well this strangeness and Lockheed's hand in deep

23:09.880 --> 23:17.240
special access programs above even DOD oversight does not end here in June of 2004 former assistant

23:17.240 --> 23:22.920
secretary of housing and urban development Catherine Austin Fitz wrote a paper titled The Black

23:22.920 --> 23:29.640
Budget of the United States this paper says that quote a large proportion of the nation's wealth

23:29.640 --> 23:36.600
is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels to support clandestine domestic

23:36.600 --> 23:42.440
military r&d she states she discovered evidence that Lockheed Martin information systems were

23:42.440 --> 23:49.480
responsible for the obfuscation of justice and may have data on the siphon DOD funds Lockheed at

23:49.480 --> 23:55.160
this time was one of the subcontractors to IBM as hired by the Pentagon to manage systems that

23:55.160 --> 24:01.240
failed a GAO audit so we have to think all of this taking place all of Lockheed's kind of

24:01.240 --> 24:08.200
shadiness around DOD and mistracking of funds are they involved with the audit as spoke about in

24:08.200 --> 24:15.560
the Wilson Davis memo and to add the icing on top here guys in 2000 commander Will Miller yes the

24:15.560 --> 24:21.320
same Miller from the Wilson Davis memo told attorney Peter Gersten that senior government

24:21.320 --> 24:28.680
officials such as a DIA director are isolated from UAP knowledge quote the keepers of the secrets

24:28.680 --> 24:37.240
reside in DOD middle management and civilian contractors like SAIC Boeing and Lockheed and

24:37.240 --> 24:42.760
are basically the comptrollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special

24:42.760 --> 24:55.880
access programs black triangles are a legendary shape of UFO seen for decades and are the responsible

24:55.880 --> 25:01.560
craft behind the 1989 Belgian UFO wave well what if I told you that there's a paper trail of evidence

25:01.560 --> 25:08.920
that suggests this black triangle commonly known as the TR3B is actually a Lockheed Martin UAP

25:08.920 --> 25:17.240
reverse engineering program called project Astra Aurora the first mention we can find of Aurora is

25:17.240 --> 25:24.600
in the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1986 and 1987 where 80 million was planned to be spent

25:24.600 --> 25:32.040
on an Aurora program in 86 and 2.3 billion in 87 for reference this was more than double the cost

25:32.040 --> 25:39.240
of the b2 spirit bomber in fact in 1997 John Greenwald of the black vault inquired into Aurora

25:39.240 --> 25:46.520
but was denied any sort of access then in the late 1990s we can go back to author Nick Cook of the

25:46.520 --> 25:52.120
hunt for zero point who interviewed former head of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks Jack Gordon while

25:52.120 --> 25:58.040
leading the plant in Palmdale Nick Cook saw a large chart illustrating the lineage of every

25:58.040 --> 26:04.920
Skunkworks aircraft since the XP80 past the Dark Star which is the plane in the film Top Gun Maverick

26:04.920 --> 26:10.680
there was something called Astra an ultra high-speed reconnaissance craft that looked triangular in

26:10.680 --> 26:17.480
shape and it looked similar to some of the triangle seen in Belgium in the early 90s and when Cook

26:17.480 --> 26:23.640
asked Gordon was flustered and denied Astra was anything but an old airliner and while we're

26:23.640 --> 26:28.440
here let's not forget about the triangle shaped craft Fausch claimed Lockheed possession was actively

26:28.440 --> 26:35.160
reverse engineering at Darse and do you guys remember the release of the Calvin UFO photo in

26:35.160 --> 26:43.720
2022-2023 which was taken in Scotland and depicts a large triangle diamond shaped UFO that was

26:43.720 --> 26:49.800
referenced by the British Ministry of Defense well if you look closely at former project Condon

26:49.800 --> 26:56.760
that was the Ministry of Defense's official UFO investigation program the Calvin UFO photo is listed

26:56.760 --> 27:04.200
as Astra slash Aurora photos among other 35 millimeter slides that don't appear on this last

27:04.200 --> 27:11.800
file this could be very significant as in this same M.O.D. Condon report the Brits were interested

27:11.880 --> 27:19.480
in investigating UAP sourced from USG contractor projects and this Aurora slash Astra may be listed

27:19.480 --> 27:24.840
here was even more interesting to note this Condon report took special interest of triangle

27:24.840 --> 27:30.600
sightings as seen here in the executive summary page of the report and it appears the British

27:30.600 --> 27:37.800
had taken a keen interest in Aurora or Astra as a USG UAP triangle craft reverse engineered

27:37.800 --> 27:43.480
because back in the 22nd of December 1992 the British Embassy in Washington DC

27:43.480 --> 27:49.960
wrote to a assistant chief of air staff in London regarding the USG's reaction to triangular UAP

27:49.960 --> 27:56.360
citing specifically a sighting that occurred three years earlier by a British royal observer

27:56.360 --> 28:03.800
core member this investigation into USAF caused quote considerable irritation by the Brits and

28:03.800 --> 28:08.200
the British officials who monitored the USG reaction are quoted as saying Secretary of the

28:08.200 --> 28:15.000
Air Force Donald B. Rice was to say the least incensed by the renewed speculation that he had

28:15.000 --> 28:21.320
lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist so as we can see guys a lot more work needs

28:21.320 --> 28:26.840
to be done investigating Aurora slash Astra but these strings connect triangular shaped craft to

28:26.840 --> 28:32.680
both Lockheed Martin and USAF and that the British M.O.D had a keen interest in finding out what the

28:32.680 --> 28:38.600
heck these things were. What's up guys I hope you enjoyed this look into Lockheed Martin and UAPs

28:39.400 --> 28:44.200
as you can see after watching this video there are a ton of public figures who make

28:44.200 --> 28:50.520
pretty bold claims about Lockheed and while these claims are most likely true as confirmed by Grush

28:50.520 --> 28:57.640
and other key people it's really hard to actually get to the bottom of this if you see our paper

28:57.640 --> 29:05.400
trail is not exceedingly long we have Lockheed Martin interacting with Blue Book in the 50s and

29:05.400 --> 29:12.680
we have our audit trail that you know very likely is involved with the audit mentioned in the Wilson

29:12.680 --> 29:19.640
Davis memo that the watch committee had to basically reorganize SAP status in the 90s to

29:20.680 --> 29:26.760
hide themselves better but what do you guys think is is Lockheed as much of a player in

29:26.760 --> 29:32.360
the reverse engineering and material exploitation of UAP as Patel I personally think so yes but

29:32.920 --> 29:39.000
they are just a lot harder to track down as our nation's largest defense contractor I imagine

29:39.000 --> 29:44.120
they have some pretty darn good record systems too keep stuff like this out what did you guys

29:44.120 --> 29:50.280
think of the witnesses I'd say order of most credible to least credible we got Bernard Haish

29:50.520 --> 29:57.320
Boyd Bushman and Don Phillips Don Phillips it's unfortunate I can't verify his background so

29:57.320 --> 30:03.240
it's really hard for me to take his word as gospel Boyd Bushman a really interesting witness says

30:03.240 --> 30:10.520
some interesting things but the toy alien I more analysis needs to be done there but quite frankly

30:10.520 --> 30:17.080
I'm not sure where to go from there but in addition the Aurora Astra could be its own

30:17.080 --> 30:22.680
hour long documentary but I just wanted to do a a summary an overview of what's going on because

30:22.680 --> 30:31.720
there's a lot more to Aurora Astra including aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish seen something

30:31.720 --> 30:37.160
called the TR3B or the triangular shaped craft in Lockheed Martin while leaving a facility and so

30:37.160 --> 30:41.480
forth so there's a lot more to dive into guys maybe I'll do that someday but I need a little bit

30:41.480 --> 30:46.280
more information on Aurora Astra some concrete information to make another video because this

30:46.280 --> 30:52.040
video is a lot of speculation for for what I like pushing the boundaries of speculation versus fact

30:53.000 --> 31:01.160
but this was an exhausting list of facts and data to make so please give a like and subscribe and I

31:01.160 --> 31:07.960
will catch you guys on the next show and before you go in victory or defeat I support the best

31:07.960 --> 31:11.320
athlete in the world Alexander Volkanovsky goodbye everybody
