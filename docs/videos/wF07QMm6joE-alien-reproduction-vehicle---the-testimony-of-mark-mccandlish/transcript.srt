1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So that's the interesting thing. There's two nomenclatures that we need to define in what your whistleblowers told you goes into his report.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's UAP and that's gray. We just don't know at this moment.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But Alien Reproduction Vehicle, I can tell you, is very, very clearly a reference to a vehicle that has been constructed from non-human technology that is being operated presumably by either private aerospace or the United States government.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A male staff member in Congressman Brown's office not only confirmed the exhibit, but the fact that there were three discs at that exhibit.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
These discs were hovering off the floor without any visible means of support. They were referred to as Alien Reproduction Vehicles.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Also nicknamed the flux liner because they used high voltage electricity.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This general got up and he was describing these vehicles. He described them as Alien Reproduction Vehicles, ARB for short.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They also had a nickname for the aircraft. They called them flux liners. Now flux is an electrical term for a high electrical charge liner, a flux liner.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Brad said that in this exhibit at Norton Air Force Base that a three-star general said that these vehicles were capable of doing light speed or better.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In his groundbreaking article released in October of 2024, accomplished journalist Michael Schellenberger brought a new UAP whistleblower's testimony to the public zeitgeist.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This whistleblower uncovered the shadowy Immaculate Constellation, an unacknowledged special access program that consolidates observations of UAP by both tasked and untasked collection platforms.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The most groundbreaking aspect of this article to me was a single sentence mention of a term made famous by aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The report concludes that the existence of Immaculate Constellation demonstrates the extent capability to detect, quarantine and transfer, UAP and ARV.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Alien Reproduction Vehicle collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the military intelligence enterprise.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Many are familiar with the famous Alien Reproduction Vehicles, also known as flux liners described by McCandlish as relayed by Brad Sorensen,

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
who allegedly witnessed these three saucer-shaped craft reverse engineered from non-human intelligence technology at a classified air show near Norton Air Force Base in 1988.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But what is the full story behind ARV? What is the origin of this term? And what stories can we explore to try and support or discredit Schellenberger's whistleblower?

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why the conspiracies around Mark McCandlish and his 2014 documentary filmmaker James Allen's mysterious deaths?

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What can we learn from a truly consequential, long-form interview primary witness Brad Sorensen gave in 1990, which I believe is the only time he ever spoke about the air show outside of conversations with McCandlish?

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And why did Brad Sorensen tell me that I was next if I investigated this story further?

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so very much for joining me as we investigate and take a deep dive into the subject of Alien Reproduction Vehicles as relayed by Mark McCandlish.

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The concept of successfully reverse engineered UFO has perplexed me for many years and with the direct naming of ARV in the Immaculate Constellation article, I believe it is a perfect time to finally dive into this subject.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let us analyze the testimony of the now infamous Mark McCandlish and explore all avenues of the Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My name is Mark McCandlish and for the better part of the last 30 years I've been a conceptual artist, illustrator and designer, working predominantly for the aerospace and defense industries.

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:20,000
About 1988 I came into some information that indicated that the United States government was in possession of and operating a kind of anti-gravity technology through a system, an aircraft that was referred to as the flux liner or as the alien reproduction vehicle.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The late Mark McCandlish served as a highly decorated aerospace and aeronautical illustrator who devoted his talents to detailing sketches of advanced military and corporate projects.

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Mark's client list was astounding including the US Air Force, Rockwell International, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, as well as respected publications such as Aviation Week and Popular Science.

28
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Viewers of my channel may remember Mark for his appearance on Stephen Greer's 2001 National Press Club panel where he discussed the line art design of the alien reproduction vehicle aka flux liner.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But few understand the full story and depth to which McCandlish explored these anomalous vehicles, a depth which very well may have seen Mark meet his demise.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In the fall of 1988, McCandlish planned to attend an air show at Norton Air Force Base to network with military and government officials, as well as view new and innovative military aircraft with his good friend and fellow designer and inventor Brad Sorenson.

31
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A short time before the show on November 12, 1988, Mark regrettably dropped out to finish some lucrative design work for popular science and left Brad to attend the air show with a client of his.

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:43,000
About a week after the show, Mark called his strangely absent friend, Brad, sounded off. On the phone, absent was his often animated personality. Brad told Mark he had seen something he probably shouldn't have.

33
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think I saw something I wasn't supposed to see. And I said, how's that possible? Everything that's at the air show is sent there and flown there with the intent to bring it on static display, especially for the public.

34
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So how could you possibly see something that wasn't intended to be seen? He says, well, he says, I got him to see a display that was a little more exclusive.

35
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Here is what Brad told Mark. Brad ultimately attended the air show with one of his clients described as a tall white man with glasses, an Italian sounding name, wealthy and a former secretary of defense or under secretary of defense.

36
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right around the time of the USAF Thunderbirds flyby at the air show, this individual issued Brad away from the main crowd.

37
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mark initially assumed Brad and the man arrived to a hangar with four connected huts in the middle for this exhibit.

38
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But Brad would later disclose he, his client, amongst military personnel and dignitaries boarded a military version of the Boeing 727 and flew north of Norton to Palmdale Air Force Plant 42.

39
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Both military and civilian that got on a military version of the Boeing 727 and they flew from Norton Air Force Base up to Air Force Plant 42, which is in Palmdale.

40
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A lot of people just consider it the Palmdale Airport. It was actually a facility that was built from what I understand by Lockheed back in the 1960s.

41
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And the hangar that is now serving as a Skunk Works hangar was the original construction site for the L-1011 Lockheed tri-star airliner.

42
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Now remember Palmdale USAF Plant 42 as we will discuss this facility later.

43
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Among the personnel sent on the 727 according to Brad were the late California Senator Alan Cranston and Congressman George E. Brown Jr.

44
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
who was at the time serving as the chairman of the Congressional Committee of Space Science and Advanced Technology.

45
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Possibly our most key individual here is Brad's client, the tall Italian man who passed Brad's office as aid to board the flight to the special exhibit.

46
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Brad seemingly never gave this man's name, or to protect Brad, McCandless never publicly confirmed this, but with high confidence Mark reasoned this individual was Frank Carlucci.

47
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The 16th US Secretary of Defense succeeded by Dick Cheney.

48
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's analyze Carlucci a little more. From 1992 to 2003 Carlucci served as chairman of the Carlisle Group, a private equity and asset management corporation with over $400 billion in assets.

49
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I highly suspect is deeply involved with UAP programs.

50
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Since its founding in 1987 under David Rubenstein, the Carlisle Group attracted myriad senior statesmen for advisors and board members including Carlucci, George H.W. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and former UK Prime Minister John Major.

51
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The Carlisle Group served as pioneer investors in defense and national security such as acquiring the electronics division of general dynamics, investing in Northrop Grumman and from 1999 to 2001 owned EG&G,

52
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the same company deeply entwined in UFO lore from the testimony of Bob Lazar to serving as the parking lot hosting the Wilson Davis meeting.

53
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I would also like to draw your attention to Ronald Moultrie, former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and the Biden Administration.

54
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Along with his good friend Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, Moultrie served to spread disinformation by denying the existence of UAP at the 2022 UAP hearings.

55
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Moultrie, sometimes referred to as a gatekeeper of UAP programs, has some very strange ties to the Carlisle Group, such as serving as a board member in iCapital,

56
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
a Carlisle-invested group and serving on the board of directors for the Better Angels funded by Carlisle's founder David Rubenstein.

57
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Carlisle Group is not the topic of our video today, but the ties here to Carlucci alongside his probable involvement in a classified airshow demonstrating ARV is of extreme interest.

58
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Walking into the Palmdale Hangar exhibit, Brad was told by his client, likely Carlucci, to keep his mouth shut and to not speak to anybody due to unexpected things at the show.

59
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The exhibit featured numerous high-tech aircraft including the losing model from the B-2 stealth bomber competition and advanced hovercraft that employed hidden thrust mechanisms.

60
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The show also had the infamous Lockheed Pulsar, aka the Aurora Craft.

61
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The Aurora, sometimes referred to as Astra, has often historically been associated with a triangular-shaped, possibly reverse-engineered craft.

62
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But in 1988, Brad relayed a much more grounded yet highly advanced design.

63
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The Lockheed Aurora was described as a large flattened-out football, all black and covered in tiles not too dissimilar to the Space Shuttle.

64
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Aurora featured a synthetic vision system utilizing infrared seeker heads.

65
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There was, at the exhibit, however, a secondary model featuring a canopy cockpit and two vertical stabilizers.

66
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Brad described this craft as employing two unusual propulsion systems, engines in the fuselage and external pulse detonation engines allowing the craft to fly 10,000 to 15,000 miles per hour.

67
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Markwood later state Tom Keaton from Lockheed Martin Calabasas Division confirmed the existence of the Aurora to him.

68
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Brad then described a massive black curtain separating the hangar into two distinct areas.

69
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Brad made his way to the second half of the exhibit.

70
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He's describing the different features.

71
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How do you know that?

72
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If you look at the outside of the vehicle, how do you know what the inner workings are?

73
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They had taken some of the panels off the outside so you could see the inside of what the corpus looked like.

74
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He said it was remarkably simple. There wasn't that much to it.

75
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You were able to figure out how it worked from that.

76
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He said, well, no, they had an easel next to it with a drawing, a cutaway drawing, that showed some of the internal components, how they were arranged and oriented to one another.

77
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then they had a little TV monitor with a tape player below it that was showing this continuous loop of this thing sitting or hovering over a dry lake bed out in the desert somewhere.

78
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And as you would watch the tape, this thing would make, went from a hovering position, made these three little sort of hops going to the side.

79
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And then as the camera followed it, it just went straight up and disappeared outside.

80
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It was you down to nothing in just a matter of a second half or so.

81
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When meeting Mark for lunch the following week, Brad would sketch and discuss what he observed at this special exhibit.

82
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The exhibit was populated solely by top military brass and influential politicians and was guarded by men in berets with M16 rifles.

83
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Displayed were three flying saucers hovering off the ground ranging in diameter from 20 to 24 feet to 120 to 130 feet, but identical in scale.

84
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Brad described the craft to Mark as looking like they belonged in the 1950s, appearing like a jello mold on the bottom with sloping sides, a dome on top and a door that looked at home on a submarine.

85
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
A three star general began to describe the vehicles to the attendees.

86
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The three saucers were called alien reproduction vehicles nicknamed flux liners.

87
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Each of the three craft had panels removed for attendees to view the craft's interior and alongside the speaker's podium sat an easel showing craft blueprints as well as a video player showing film demonstrating the ARV's capabilities.

88
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:00,000
As Mark described, the film showed the ARV hovering over a dry lake bed before it would make three quick hops and jettison into the sky at astounding speeds.

89
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:11,000
One of the things that this general had said during the presentation, one of the things that really stood out at Brad's mind was that he said that these vehicles were capable of light speed or better.

90
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Faster than light speeds is truly an astounding claim, so let's try and analyze the ARV in greater detail.

91
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Fortunately, as a designer himself, Brad would describe the flux liners in extensive detail to Mark, allowing the talented artist to make up high quality blueprints and line art of the craft.

92
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It is important to note the difference between the ARV and historical UAP testimony.

93
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In numerous UAP and UAP crash sightings, Crafter often described as rivetless, seamless with no visible means of propulsion.

94
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Often with a description of the vehicle looking 3D printed, this was night and day different to the ARV.

95
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sorenson described the ARV as extremely worn, appearing to have been operating for decades.

96
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Chips were rampant in the lead paint coating of the craft, which seemed to serve to protect the crew from X-ray radiation, and the entire craft featured numerous smudges and fingerprints.

97
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Each of the three ARVs featured a crew compartment.

98
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The smallest design displayed four ejection seats attached to a vertical beam in the middle of the craft.

99
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The pilot utilized a strange ball control scheme to operate the craft which allocated power to various parts of the craft's propulsion mechanism we will talk about shortly.

100
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The ARV featured no windows for pilot visibility.

101
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Instead, each saucer dome was outfitted with an array of bumps housing optical camera equipment.

102
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
This fitted the craft with a synthetic vision system.

103
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This synthetic vision system uses the same kind of technology as the gun slaving system they have in the Apache helicopter, except in this case you have two cameras.

104
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And it picks any pair of the cameras in that pattern of six that are around this circumference, including the one on the top.

105
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Whichever pair most closely matches the orientation of the pilot's head.

106
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So if he wants to look behind him, he can pick a view in that direction.

107
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The cameras slew in pairs and he has a little screen in front of his helmet and it gives him an alternating view.

108
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He has a little set of glasses that he wears.

109
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In fact, you can actually buy a 3D viewing system for your video camera now that does the same thing.

110
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What it does is it uses a beam splitter which sends part of light one way and part of it at a right angle and offsets it by about six inches.

111
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then it has an electronic shutter in there that uses these like a liquid crystal type material that darkens and becomes transparent at intervals of about 60th of a second or 30th of a second.

112
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And so the cameras as they're looking around are giving him a right left right left view.

113
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And the goggles, the things that he's wearing, he has two little projection screens inside his helmet.

114
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And they both project, well two cameras, but one projection screen.

115
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And the glasses have that special blocking device that allows one eye to see and then the other eye to see.

116
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And at the same time, the cameras are projecting right view, left view, right view, left view, but they're doing it in like 30 frames a second.

117
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And so when he looks around, he has a perfect 3D view of the outside but no windows.

118
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The crew compartment or dome was completely separate from the propulsion system.

119
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And the propulsion system made no noise, featured no moving parts and output no gases or exhaust.

120
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Interestingly, Brad would state many of the craft's components including the crew jump seats and cameras seem similar to off shelf components and not highly specialized for the ARV.

121
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Radial oxygen tanks, presumably for crew atmosphere, sat atop an enormous capacitor array estimated by Mark to be roughly 14 inches thick.

122
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Curiously, a radial arm sat above the capacitor plates featuring the ability to extend outside the body of the craft.

123
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Mark theorized the purpose of this arm was for sample collection.

124
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Mark questioned Brad if due to the capacitor array, he thought this meant the craft function via the by-field brown effect which converts electrostatic energy into propulsion.

125
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
To learn more about electro-gravitics and I feel like I've said this in the last five videos, I highly recommend watching Jesse Michael's video on T. Townsend-Brownt and please note,

126
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I recently theorized Edwards Air Force Base, which is very close to USAF Plant 42 and Norton, engages in the reverse engineering ARV testing program.

127
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Historically, Edwards placed very heavy importance in alternative propulsion methods such as the by-field brown effect.

128
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I highly recommend watching this video as over the course of this ARV exploration, we will further discuss ties to Edwards.

129
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Brad stated perhaps the by-field brown effect had some sort of application here, but the ARV were in fact utilizing energy drawn from quantum fluctuations, a.k.a. zero point energy.

130
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This again calls back to the witness Ed I covered in my video on reverse engineering at Edwards Air Force Base, who commented on the existence of zero point systems.

131
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There is a scientist in Utah by the name of Maury B. King. He's written a book called Tapping the Zero Point Energy and what he maintains is that this energy is embedded in space time all around us.

132
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's in everything we see. I think it was, I don't know, it was a James Clerk Maxwell speculated that there's enough of this flux, this electrical charge in the nothingness of space

133
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that if you could capture all the energy that was embedded in just a cubic yard of space, that you'd have enough energy to boil the oceans of the entire world.

134
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's how much energy is sitting there waiting to be tapped.

135
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Before we continue with Mark's investigation, let's take a moment to recognize Mark as Berlin's secondhand information up to now on ARV.

136
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why should we take him at his word and do we have comment from Mr. Sorensen?

137
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Due to not having journalistic discretion, Mark historically regretted introducing Brad's full name into the story.

138
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And I had a colleague, a friend who I'll just call Brad for the sake of this discussion.

139
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Some people know what his last name is and I've tried to discontinue using his name principally because disclosing of his name has brought a lot of unwanted attention to him and his career.

140
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know specifically what if any or how much harm has come to him in terms of his career because of my disclosures.

141
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I have to say that not being a journalist, not having a background in journalism, I didn't really know when I was being prodded by people in the disclosure project to name names and things like that, which I did.

142
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That, you know, this could be potentially and very harmful to the individuals who had been the original source of material.

143
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:16,000
In the case of Brad, and another individual who had had occasion to see one of these things up close when he was actually in the service in 1973 at Edwards Air Force Base.

144
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There were a lot of details that were not only seen by these individuals, but were also explained to them, you know, basically to understand what they were looking at.

145
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Brad has been strangely radio silent on Mark in the story of ARV.

146
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Well, of course, I got in contact with Brad.

147
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Interactions with him from the get go were extremely hostile.

148
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was told, quote, Mark McCandless was a stupid, dramatic, selfish fool who died because he could not keep his mouth shut.

149
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Learn from this, end quote.

150
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This statement is in relation to Mark's strange and controversial 2021 passing, allegedly resulting from a self-inflicted gunshot wound we will revisit later.

151
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But Brad's words directly imply Mark's words got him killed.

152
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Further interactions with Brad would lead to him saying I cannot cover this topic without facing mortal peril and to say goodbye to everyone I love if I continue to investigate Mark in the subject of ARV.

153
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I was even told I would never see it coming.

154
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
My most interesting interaction with Brad stemmed from asking why Mark was allowed to talk openly about this topic for 20 years.

155
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I was told Brad protected Mark until he could not.

156
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We will discuss this further later.

157
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Hostile and silent, Brad has historically refused to comment on this case.

158
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But for this investigation, I have uncovered some documents I have never before seen discussed in the public domain.

159
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:58,000
In December of 1990, two years after Mark and Brad met to discuss the flux liner, Mark relayed the contents of the restricted air show to William B. Scott, senior engineering editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology.

160
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Bill would feature some of Mark's sketches on the pulse detonation Aurora craft on the respected magazine and reach out to Brad for comment on the experimental aircraft and more strange craft.

161
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
As some of the craft Mark described, matched eyewitness accounts relayed to the prestigious magazine over the years.

162
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Around this time, Brad went silent, even secluding himself to Mark, but not before Bill Scott was able to interview Brad on December 3, 1990.

163
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's dive into this interview I have never once before seen discussed.

164
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Brad stated he was not officially invited to the hangar in which the strange aircraft exhibit was stored.

165
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He was, as Mark stated, passed off as an aide for a gentleman who served within the Carter administration.

166
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Seen as Frank Carducci was deputy director of the CIA for Carter, he may still serve as a logical choice here.

167
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But why did Brad take this interview?

168
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, as he stated, quote, because I love America and the whole nine yards, but I'm also a Democrat and I don't think we need this type of spending on military equipment.

169
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's just nuts.

170
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And that's what the whole meeting was for.

171
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Appropriations of billions of dollars to develop new craft, end quote.

172
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Very interesting statement.

173
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The 30 or so individuals present here were to be shown prototype and craft functionality to attract investors to these black budget projects.

174
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Brad described blue fatigued and suit clad men conducting the briefings at the special air show with exotic yet prosaic craft on display.

175
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Quote, Diff in each area, like a specialist in each area, some wearing suits, some wearing military, like Air Force, Colonel, Major, something like that.

176
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I did not see any stars in there, like generals of any sort.

177
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If there had, I would have noticed that end quote.

178
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Bill and Brad discussed some of the veto, vertical takeoff and landing craft at the show and the utilization of depleted uranium shells.

179
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Brad even noticed the V-22 Osprey was present, whose first official flight was conducted in 1989.

180
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The witness also confirmed the presence of California State Senator Alan Cranston.

181
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The rest of the crowd all appeared to be senior individuals, 45 to 60 years old.

182
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
No support staff or aides surrounded what Brad referred to as the people.

183
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This section of the exhibit was likened to the hangar deck of an aircraft carrier with tightly packed craft.

184
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Most of the craft appeared to Brad as one-off prototypes.

185
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
One of the enclosures featured the losing B-2 bomber prototypes just as Mark would later state.

186
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Brad also confirmed the unmanned, elongated, football-shaped Aurora craft that looked extremely similar to Mark's sketches but with a more tapered back.

187
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The craft was enormous, almost 100 to 110 feet in length.

188
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The dual propulsion system of the Aurora was also confirmed.

189
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Internal fuselage engines were utilized to get up into the air.

190
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Then pulse detonation engines were used to accelerate the craft to truly incredible speeds, 6 to 8 Mach, which is why the craft was unmanned.

191
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The present officials were extremely proud of the Aurora craft, stating quote,

192
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
within an hour and 20 minutes they could take out every city over a million in the Soviet Union, end quote.

193
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Bill Scott asked if the Aurora was the most exotic thing on display.

194
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Brad responded with a resounding three nos.

195
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Brad would then state Mark's ARV drawing was so GD accurate, there was little he could further specify about the craft.

196
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
When Brad first witnessed the alien reproduction vehicles, he was reminded of a nursery rhyme, labeling the craft Daddy, Mommy, and Baby Bear,

197
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
as the craft seemed identically crafted to the same proportions but in different sizes.

198
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
The smallest was roughly 20 feet in diameter, medium 60 feet and the largest 120 feet in diameter.

199
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Brad stated he thought the craft were very poorly built compared to the other craft on display, quote,

200
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
they had been built by scientists who didn't know a hell of a lot about laying up composite materials or whatever, end quote.

201
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The crew compartment sphere appeared to have messy filaments for the sole purpose of holding in pressure.

202
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The entire craft was coated with a thick, heavy lead paint.

203
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Brad confirmed the ARVs were hovering, not connected to the floor.

204
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Brad was told the three craft didn't need a fuel source.

205
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They had found a new fuel source that was everywhere in the universe on the order of 500 times the speed of light,

206
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
allowing the craft to travel five to eight times the speed of light.

207
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
To dive into the gravity manipulation propulsion system, which Mark would later on discuss further,

208
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the craft was able to output 10 to the 26 power joules per cubic meter of space.

209
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Utilizing the synthetic vision system and pilot control ball,

210
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the vehicle was able to allocate power from the capacitor plates to travel to very different destinations,

211
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
all with the ability to withstand 85 Gs of acceleration.

212
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The local area around the craft was not subject to inertial forces.

213
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Mark will expand on this later on.

214
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Curiously to Brad, the craft didn't feature food or long-term provisions,

215
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
nor were any compasses or navigational charts present.

216
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Drawings, diagrams, and videotapes showed the craft flying in jerky, serrated, up-and-down patterns before jettisoning out of sight.

217
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The craft did not appear to involve normal aerodynamic principles.

218
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The exhibit attendees were told there were only three craft in existence.

219
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Quote,

220
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You can take this how you want to.

221
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We took all of it with a grain of salt.

222
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But the guy said that with this group of craft that, uh, they had been everywhere in the solar system,

223
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and there's no life, end quote.

224
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I must make a correction here, as initially Brad said no life in the universe,

225
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
but he corrected this to mean solar system.

226
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The men running the ARV exhibit claimed they copied the concepts of the vehicle.

227
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Bill asked if the non-uniformed man answering audience questions

228
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
discussed what the vehicles had been produced from.

229
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Quote,

230
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Well, they tried to avoid it.

231
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They said something about 1947.

232
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They had some sort of a contact,

233
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
telling them that we had no right to use nuclear weapons, okay?

234
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That it was more disturbed than we knew.

235
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Cease and assist, end quote.

236
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Brad would then give, in my opinion, the most interesting statement of this entire interview.

237
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And all they really needed to do was give us the truth,

238
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and we would either take it or leave it.

239
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
They just said that they had come across some hardware, tried to make contact with these.

240
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The others didn't want to make contact.

241
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They just wanted to deliver the news and leave, okay?

242
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But back in 1947, we had just won the war.

243
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We felt pretty damned cavalier, and we attacked, basically, okay?

244
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Rather than fighting back, they just tried to destroy all of their stuff and get away.

245
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And they didn't get all of it destroyed.

246
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That's what they said.

247
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Also said they couldn't really make those things that they found work.

248
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That they had to build their own.

249
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That this was built for our consumption, not theirs.

250
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Theirs was the wrong scale and the wrong, you know, whatever.

251
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Bill says,

252
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So we just looked at theirs and built our own.

253
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Brad responds,

254
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Uh-huh.

255
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Based on what was seen.

256
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So it was not like a great R&D breakthrough.

257
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It was just copying something that they had seen to the best of their abilities.

258
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I need to take a moment to stress just how important this interview with Brad Sorensen and Bill Scott is.

259
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Quite often, you will see individuals criticize Mark McCandless's story

260
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
because they claim he is relaying second-hand information.

261
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
As we saw in this interview, which I have never seen once discussed before,

262
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Brad confirms not only the air show,

263
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
not only the Aurora,

264
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
not only the B2 losing competitor and the stealth bomber prototypes,

265
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but also the ARV craft as saucers with faster than light speed capabilities.

266
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
This is massive to see this in Brad's own words.

267
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Why did Bill Scott and Aviation Week in Space Technology never publish this segment?

268
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, it makes sense as we saw in the document where

269
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Bill states that he had trouble believing some of the things Brad said

270
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
because it had to do with flying saucers that were capable of light speed

271
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that were copied from other beans in technology dating back to 1947.

272
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Just wanted to take a minute to say that if you want to read the entire interview,

273
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I highly suggest it because I just did a summary here.

274
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The entire thing is quite mind-boggling.

275
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Back to the investigation.

276
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Was the ARV technology copied from the 1947 Roswell craft?

277
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The crudeness of the craft makes logical sense when in context

278
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
scientists and engineers couldn't make the found anomalous craft work.

279
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The men spearheading the ARV program wished to build a fleet of these craft,

280
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
but sought appropriate funding for it,

281
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
hoping the Bush administration would be as enthusiastic as the Reagan administration

282
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
about building up these reproduction vehicles.

283
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Never was it revealed who these vehicles belonged to

284
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
or who these men reported to.

285
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Wow guys, so 11 years before Mark appeared on the disclosure project

286
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
making the term ARV famous,

287
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Brad had actually confirmed the story all the way back in 1990.

288
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Included in these interview notes is a sketch of the exhibit

289
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
which I believe was drawn by Sorensen's hand.

290
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's circle back to Mark and dive into his investigation around the ARV.

291
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
After listening intently to Sorensen and analyzing the rough sketches of the ARVs,

292
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Brad drew on some legal paper.

293
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Mark got to work utilizing his legendary drawing skills

294
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to translate the ARV to traditional blueprint designs.

295
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Mark's work ultimately led to the now famous ARV flux liner cutaway drawing.

296
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
One of the original blueprints of the alien reproduction vehicle

297
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
which I produced in March of 1989,

298
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:45,000
was put together by accumulating a lot of verbal testimony from Brad and later

299
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
from a number of other sources including Kent Snowlin and some other people

300
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
that I talked to who had some contact or information about the vehicle.

301
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
In this clip we heard Mark mention alongside Sorensen

302
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
his design was based on the testimony of others who had seen the craft.

303
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In 2001, McCandlish would feature in Stephen Greer's National Press Club conference

304
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
with his explosive testimony as well as a Stephen Greer interview

305
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
titled Blueprint for a UFO where he would expand on additional sightings of ARV.

306
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Later, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of Kent Snowlin

307
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that I met at an air show at Edwards Air Force Base in 1992,

308
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
the first unveiling publicly of the B-2 bomber.

309
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He indicated to me that in 1973 when he was a crew chief

310
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
working on experimental aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base

311
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
that he had unintentionally wandered into an area where there was a classified aircraft, namely the ARV.

312
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He described it in detail and he added other details to the account

313
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
concerning the configuration and the operations vehicle that Brad Sorensen was not aware of

314
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
According to Selin, while working for the Air Intelligence Agency at Edwards North Base

315
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
he witnessed the Fluxliner ARV in 1973 when cutting across the base to retrieve a ground power unit.

316
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Sightings of ARV at Edwards are possibly corroborated within the long-lost files of Leonard Stringfield.

317
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
In crash retrievals of the third kind, fantastic CAD designer Michael Schrat

318
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
gained access to the files of the late Stringfield in Mufon, Ohio.

319
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Here, Schrat would publish cases that had not made their way into the crash retrieval status reports 1-7.

320
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Leonard received information from a Class A witness who claimed to have witnessed a captured UFO at Edwards.

321
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
This pilot was given permission to cut across the base in a USAF security vehicle

322
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
when he stopped at a group of hangars to ask for directions.

323
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Within the open hangars, the witness observed a large disc-shaped craft with a clear transparent dome on the top.

324
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The witness was immediately told to vacate the area. The incident allegedly took place in the 1960s.

325
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Similar instances exist in the files of Stringfield such as the testimony of one Mr. Hines

326
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
who relayed second-hand info from a source at Bell Labs.

327
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In the early 1950s, this source saw a UFO retrieval or test craft being brought into a California airbase.

328
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The source additionally saw a cutaway of the craft.

329
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The fantastic 2014 documentary we've been pulling clips from titled Zero Point, The Story of Mark McCandless and the Fluxliner

330
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
explores an additional witness who claimed to have knowledge of the ARV, one Lieutenant Colonel John Williams.

331
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Williams' 2000 testimony also features briefly in Stephen Greer's fantastic disclosure briefing document.

332
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Williams served as an electrical engineer in charge of construction projects for military air command at Norton from 1981 to 1982.

333
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The Lieutenant Colonel stated he knew of a facility within Norton Air Force Base that was so secretive

334
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
not even the base's wing commander was allowed access.

335
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Rumors circulated the base facility housed a UFO. Very little more than rumors here in Williams' story,

336
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
however, even the implication of a craft near Norton is worthy to analyze.

337
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Mark's pursuit of tracking down other witnesses of ARV was relentless.

338
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In 2001, on the Disclosure Project conference panel, Mark would display two original photographs obtained from

339
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
USAF Captain Harvey Williams, who photographed a disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah.

340
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Mark would state the images accurately depict the ARV craft up to the synthetic vision systems on the crew component of the craft.

341
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Mark utilized these photographs to highlight how the synthetic vision system may have changed from 1967 to 1988.

342
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:56,000
As mentioned before, many components of the 1988 ARV as relayed by Brad utilized off-shelf components, including the synthetic vision systems and surrounding acrylic bubble.

343
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Mark reasoned due to cameras being much larger in 1967, the vision system bubbles would need to be much larger as well to accommodate these devices.

344
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Interesting to analyze this possible ARV evolution.

345
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Later on, I obtained photographs that were taken in 1967 by military pilot Harvey Williams flying a C-47 for the Air Force at 12,000 feet approximately 25 miles southwest of Provo, Utah.

346
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
This particular vehicle matches the so-called ARV in all proportions and respects in terms of the detail of the shape of the craft.

347
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I would like to quickly highlight Provo, Utah is under 100 miles from Dugway Proving Grounds, a location I have covered previously.

348
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Witness MS claimed to have observed a hovering craft at the Dugway Aviary Building and also knew of a DUM, a deep underground military base engaging in UAP programs under Dugway's main facility.

349
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:06,000
From 1988 to his passing in 2021, Mark's insatiable curiosity would lead him to devoting much of his life to discovering how the ARV functioned.

350
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:19,000
He would draw parallels to possible Nazi flying saucer technology and the Glock, patents filed by associates of T. Townsend Brown, and even technology possibly discovered by the great Nikola Tesla.

351
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Mark's research led him to hypothesize an elegantly simple yet crude design.

352
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The ARV system, for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities, was indeed remarkably simple.

353
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia, with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought.

354
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy, or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes.

355
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off.

356
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The most complicated aspect of the ARV to Mark seemed to be the pilot's control system.

357
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The sphere itself appears to be a kind of a domed arrangement where you have a number of fiber optic leaves that come into the sphere.

358
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And for each one of the 48 capacitor arrays, there's a series of sensors that are then used to sort of relay information to the individual plates.

359
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And so then, on the bottom of this, you have a bowl that moves around and can be used to convey the commands of the pilot in terms of what he wants to do in terms of shaping the field around the vehicle.

360
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And right in the center of that bowl is a kind of laser diode that sends a laser beam up into the underside, the inside of the sphere.

361
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And so as the bowl moves, that laser is sort of scanning around on the inside of the different sensors that are responsible for each of the capacitor sections.

362
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Then there's a series of relays that will open up and close and let a certain amount of energy in or prevent it from going in.

363
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And when it's dead center, it means that all of them get the exact same amount of information. You just go straight up.

364
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If you want to bank to the right, then you bank this to the right. It sends the laser signal over to the opposite side of the dome.

365
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And it says that the opposite side of the craft is going to get more energy, so it banks in that direction.

366
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It's kind of like in a helicopter, in the swash plate of a helicopter, when you want to bank to the left, you create more deflection in the main rotor on the right side so that it begins to bank to the left.

367
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's kind of the same principle.

368
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Mark theorized the craft operated in space-time similar to an Alcubierre drive, a system that compresses space-time ahead of a craft and stretches space-time behind a craft.

369
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The area between these two vectors creates a localized space-time, reducing inertial effects and mitigating G-forces for the craft.

370
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The Alcubierre drive allows for a faster-than-light travel system, however. The validity of this drive has been debated endlessly, and I simply do not have the physics capabilities to contribute to this argument.

371
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,000
This mitigation of G-forces and inertial dampening seems to be present in numerous historical UAP sightings where instantaneous acceleration is observed.

372
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Perhaps a localized space-time pocket is indeed possible with NHI and ARV craft, and I'd like to leave you with some words by former Northrop Grumman deputy CTO and colonel of Army Futures Command, Carl Nell.

373
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The second point is faster-than-light travel. Everybody says faster-than-light travel is not possible. This is false.

374
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Miguel Alcubierre, a postgraduate student at the University of Mexico in 1994, solved Einstein's equations for an effective faster-than-light mechanism. NASA has investigated this. Everyone accepts his solution as valid.

375
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
These performance characteristics draw my attention to estimating flight characteristics of anomalous, unidentified aerial vehicles by Professor Kevin Knuth.

376
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
In this paper, PhD Professor Knuth estimated the G-forces experienced by the Tic Tac craft in Commander David Fraver's 2004 sighting.

377
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:28,000
G-forces experienced by this craft when it dropped from a high altitude to sea level were estimated to reach in excess of 5,500 Gs, for reference.

378
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Our best ballistic missiles can experience but a fraction of these G-forces before ripping themselves to shreds.

379
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Mark's research would ultimately lead to a 2015 lecture at the secret space program titled The Feasibility of Interstellar Travel.

380
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The summary of this discussion states, quote, how back-engineered off-world technology created powerful leverage for corporations to take over control of world government,

381
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
establish an internationally manned secret space program, and break away civilization, end quote.

382
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Even though first-hand witness Brad Sorensen stated the enigmatic men showing off the ARV claim the craft had explored our solar system, this is a very charged statement by Mark.

383
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oftentimes, the phrase secret space program is associated with unexplained claims and outright bizarre stories.

384
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So let's instead analyze the claims of Gary McKinnon and Edgar Fausch in relation to a secret space program.

385
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I have spoken about USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch myriad times, most recently analyzing his claims of encountering full anti-gravity propulsion systems for a secret space fleet while working for the proposed Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979.

386
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Fausch claimed triangular-shaped craft titled TR-3B leveraged reverse-engineer technology to provide logistics and transportation to a secret space fleet.

387
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Construction of these craft are allegedly a joint effort by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Teledyne, and the project is managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA.

388
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Fausch's testimony is extremely impactful for me due to stating pilots of the TR-3B craft are few and far between.

389
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
These elite pilots are plucked from the Edwards 412th Test Group Test Pilot School.

390
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I recently did a whole investigation into this subject and with high confidence in this project's validity, I explored a joint research project between Edwards Air Force Base and Nellis Air Force Base focused on testing reverse-engineered craft and technology of non-human origin.

391
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This project I explored employs contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, SKIMS funds off the F-35 fighter program, operates over restricted airspace such as the Nevada Test and Training Range, and employs the Edwards 412th Test Pilot School and Electronics Warfare Group.

392
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Have no fears that TR-3B will get a full exploration of its own, but context around Mark's discussion on a secret space program is extremely valuable here.

393
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Additionally, remember if you will, US Army Green Beret RA, who witnessed the off-world technologies division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana.

394
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:09,000
RA stated in an interview to me while performing operations on Nellis and nearby DOE-owned land, he was witnessed to triangular-shaped craft operating off electro-gravitic propulsion.

395
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
In 2002, British hacker Gary McKinnon was arrested for hacking into US Army and NASA computer systems.

396
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:26,000
McKinnon claimed amongst mundane files was an image housed in the NASA Johnson Space Center featuring a cigar-shaped object stationed in near-Earth orbit.

397
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
McKinnon also claimed to have found a document on a NASA server titled Non-Terrestrial Officers containing names and ranks of USAF personnel.

398
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Amongst these documents were tabs for material transfer between ships.

399
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
This already draws parallels to Foush's TR-3B logistics and personnel carrier ships.

400
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So maybe this idea of a black-budget hidden space program isn't so fantastical. Let's see what Mark has to say in this discussion.

401
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I want to talk to you about a few of the different vehicles that I believe are being used in the secret space program or have been used in the secret space program.

402
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Craft listed here are of course the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle as well as the first-generation Aurora constructed by Lockheed

403
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and a triangular-shaped craft out of Lockheed Skunkworks that allegedly served as the target for a 1989 Germany crash retrieval operation.

404
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The candlest detailed how his first suspicions of highly classified black-budget aircraft programs arose when he met two Lockheed Skunkworks personnel

405
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
who commissioned Mark to illustrate a pitch to DoD for a new jet with extreme speed capabilities.

406
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Mark compared components of scramjet technology to create what he thought was an extremely eye-catching design.

407
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Meeting with these Skunkworks personnel, they grew furious with Mark, accidentally letting it slip aircraft components would tear apart during Mach 17 speeds or 13,000 miles per hour.

408
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And remember, this was before Lockheed became Lockheed Martin, so this incident occurred even before the Sorenson ARV incident.

409
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:06,000
For reference, the world's fastest jet, the unmanned NASA X-43, reaches a top speed of Mach 9.6 or 7,366 miles per hour.

410
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And the world's fastest man jet, the SR-71 Blackbird, reached solely Mach 3.3 or 2,193 miles per hour.

411
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Mark moved on to discuss in great detail Sorenson's ARV experience in 1988.

412
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Not a ton of new information here we haven't already covered.

413
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Mark did touch on the interesting point that Brad and most likely Frank Carlucci flew a short flight to Palmdale Air Force Plant 42 to view this special exhibit.

414
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:51,000
As they were going into the hangar, the gentleman turns to my friend and says, he just realized that there are some aircraft on exhibit here that you're not cleared for security-wise.

415
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You are not cleared to see these aircraft, so just enjoy the show, walk around, listen, take a look, but don't say anything to anybody.

416
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So he goes in, I don't know how well you can see this because it came out kind of light, but there were two sections to this particular hangar on the inside.

417
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I would like to add Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale is less than 30 miles southwest of Edwards Air Force Base.

418
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The site features a sizable Northrop Grumman facility as well as Lockheed Martin hangars and the home of the infamous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Division.

419
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The claim these ARVs were shown at Plant 42 very near Edwards matches very closely with my previous thesis of a joint reverse engineering program out of Edwards.

420
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Now, Witness Ed stated he worked on joint programs with Lockheed Martin and Boeing, yet historically Northrop has been additionally implicated in the construction of the TR-3B Black MantaCraft and an anti-gravity disc known as the Great Pumpkin developed at Northrop Grumman Advanced Concepts and Technologies Division, Palmdale, California.

421
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Hang tight guys because our next project will cover US aerospace craft allegedly built with NHI technology, especially because there are numerous claims of joint developed reverse engineered craft from Lockheed Skunk Works and Northrop Grumman.

422
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:22,000
All of these deviations from Mark's story are to say I find the continued parallels between the alien reproduction vehicle and the 412th reverse engineering group at Edwards and Nellis quite tangible as well as the addition of Northrop Grumman to the core contractors engaging in ARV.

423
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Mark leveraged his understanding of physics to discuss how the ARV craft possibly generated three different electromagnetic fields. One created by the primary windings of the Tesla coil, one created by the windings in the center, and finally one created by a low temperature plasma fired through the center.

424
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And guys, I say this all the time, physics really isn't my strong suit so please watch the lecture for a better understanding.

425
00:49:46,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So in the process, what I really think that I've sort of stumbled across is a way in which this system here has three different electromagnetic fields. It has the one created by the primary windings of the Tesla coil.

426
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It has the windings in the center that also creates their electromagnetic field. But then when that plasma ring, or I should say it's actually a sort of a low temperature plasma like phenomenon or a virtual plasma, it fires down through the center and it also creates its own set of electromagnetic field lines.

427
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And so what happens is you have an effect, it's very similar to, you've heard of the electromagnetic pulse that occurs when a nuclear bomb goes off. Well they actually have a weapons called the explosively pumped electromagnetic pulse weapon.

428
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And it does the same thing and what it does is it just combines overlapping electromagnetic field lines and then using explosives, it pinches all, oops, sorry, it pinches all those magnetic field lines and it creates a powerful pulse.

429
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And so what I'm suggesting to you is that process is actually forms a kind of a doorway for tapping into this zero point energy. Now why is that significant? Why does that mean anything?

430
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Well part of the reason is that this device, when it taps into zero point energy, they've shown that zero point energy is actually responsible for the effect of gravity, for inertia and for mass.

431
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And so if you're pulling some of that energy out of the environment, it may be, even though there's an infinite amount, I mean some of the latest figures are 10 to the 109th power joules per cubic centimeter.

432
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That's one of the latest figures I've seen. That's a monstrous amount of energy. That's enough energy that if you took all of the energy that's in this amount of space time and were able to tap it, it would be able to boil off the oceans of the entire planet.

433
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So you can see how this technology makes a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker. That's probably one of the reasons why there's such a tremendous effort to suppress it because in the wrong hands obviously it could be weaponized, it'd be very dangerous.

434
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Now for example, Einstein said you can never travel faster than speed of light because as you accelerate through space time, your interaction with the zero point energy that's embedded in space time raises your mass.

435
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And so it makes it harder and harder for you to go faster and faster so you can never really reach the speed of light.

436
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
In fact he said if you could, that as you approach the speed of light, that your mass would become near infinite.

437
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So imagine then that you're actually using the free energy of zero point energy. You're tapping that as your propulsive force. You're using it in the environment.

438
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:36,000
So there's a couple things that might happen when you do this. One is that it reduces the mass of your vehicle because you're using this stuff that would otherwise create to its increase.

439
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And you're using that to do work. You're using it as a propulsive force.

440
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:54,000
So under that theory, under that theory you could actually be able to accelerate up to and beyond the speed of light because the very energy that would be ordinarily slowing you down by raising your mass is actually what you're using to push you along.

441
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I do find it very interesting since 1975 Los Alamos National Labs was conducting extensive research into these explosive magnetic flux compression generators.

442
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Mark would then highlight a Polaroid image taken north of Cedarville, California in the spring of 1984, which he purported may be one of the only photographs in existence of a string of vehicles used in this secret space program.

443
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Mark even illustrated the craft based on the eyewitnesses testimony.

444
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Now under a loop looking at the original Polaroid, you can actually see a little bit more detail. This was a drawing done by the eyewitnesses of fellow who took the photograph.

445
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And there were some things about it that I could probably go into, but the thing that's important to remember is that some of the features look remarkably like some of the structure on the so-called alien reproduction vehicle.

446
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And in fact, it did it seem apparent to him that these wingtips, if you want to call them that, could actually rotate inward so that this thing would actually become more of a triangular shape, which also, of course, would help with issues like storage.

447
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Now this is a little bit more detailed drawing than I did based on what I could see through the loop.

448
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Near the end of the presentation, Mark circled back to the May 1989 East Germany crash recovery of a Lockheed Martin advanced aerospace vehicle.

449
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:24,000
This craft recovery is claimed to have been executed by special forces, ringing parallels to the numerous claims of JSOC units involved in foreign and domestic UAP crash retrieval operations.

450
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Mark likened this craft to the F-117A stealth fighter utilizing stealth technologies.

451
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The most interesting component of this craft were the three spheres on the underside of the craft appearing to be made of a white superconducting ceramic material.

452
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
The crash of this vehicle allegedly broke off the tail section, dislodging one of these spheres.

453
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The pilot involved with the crash told Mark the retrieval team was ordered not to touch the sparking sphere with bare hands.

454
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Mark theorized these spheres utilized some sort of cryogenic fluid to harness zero point energy systems, meaning the craft may have employed ARB systems.

455
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
When I finally did get around to making a copy of this original drawing in the form of Blueprint, I sent a copy to Brad.

456
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And one of the first things that he said to me on the phone was, and he wasn't kidding when he said this, he said, you know, Mark,

457
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
he says this drawing is about as accurate as you can get.

458
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
He says every detail, every aspect of it is right on the money.

459
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
He said it is so accurate in every way.

460
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
He says this has to be probably one of the most dangerous illustrations you've ever done in your life.

461
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And he says if you're smart, he says you'll tear up the original, you'll throw it away, and you'll never talk about it again.

462
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:49,000
After Mark appeared on the 2001 disclosure project speaking openly to the world about the alien reproduction vehicle, he got the strange feeling his activities were being monitored.

463
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Mark was called and warned to stop doing what he was doing and one by one he lost all of his defense clients.

464
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Mark reasoned he understood why some corporations and individuals may not have wanted to be associated with somebody speaking about flying saucers.

465
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Further attacks would see Mark threatened on the phone and his money and cars taken by the IRS.

466
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Mark would carry a heavy feeling of guilt and regret including Brad Sorensen's name, stating he was almost coerced by Dr. Greer not to protect names.

467
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I mean, there's many times I lay awake at night with my 9mm under my pillow, he loaded, and I wonder why they haven't killed me.

468
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And I honestly do.

469
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:38,000
As we discussed earlier, I have played many clips from the fantastic documentary Zero Point The Story of Mark McCandless and The Fluxliner by the late filmmaker James Allen.

470
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:47,000
This documentary discusses strange deaths of free energy pioneers such as fundamental physicist Stefan Marinov who fell out of a window in 1997.

471
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Cold fusion researcher Eugene Malove who was beaten to death in 2004.

472
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Zero Point Field Investor Arie de Goose who was found dead in his car in 2007.

473
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And Star Drive inventor Mark Tomion who died unexpectedly in 2009 after a successful demonstration of his prototype.

474
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The best example here is the case of Amy Eskridge which I may save for a future full investigation.

475
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Dr. Amy Eskridge was a 35 year old scientist and co-founder of the Institute for Exotic Science in Huntsville, Alabama.

476
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
In 2022, Amy died in what was ruled a self-inflicted instance.

477
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
However, an incredible amount of controversy surrounds her passing.

478
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Leading up to her death, Amy had been lecturing on behalf of Holocron Engineering, a gravity modification R&D company,

479
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:42,000
discussing historical anti-gravity experiments and modern black projects associated with developing the anti-gravity TR-3B craft.

480
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Again, we'll save this for another time.

481
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Mark admitted he had no idea what the ARV and these technologies were used for,

482
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
but he did state clandestine military operations may stop at nothing.

483
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
To prevent these technologies from leaking to the public and foreign adversaries,

484
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and housing these programs alongside defense contractors would strengthen classification of programs utilizing these systems.

485
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And these strange deaths very well may include James Hallen of the 2014 documentary.

486
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The details around his death are highly suspicious.

487
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
This is the young man who produced the film that you'll probably have a chance to see later on, James Allen.

488
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
He's passed away now.

489
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And this was literally just a month before the film was released.

490
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And he suddenly became very sick.

491
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
He was in the hospital. He died within two and a half months.

492
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And the manner of his illness was so peculiar and so strange.

493
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
We decided to go have some pathology done.

494
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And what we found, it's really hard to see on this chart because it's so small.

495
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I wish I could blow it up somehow.

496
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But basically, all of these little things here we see and age next to those levels right there,

497
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:58,000
those are all radioisotopes like uranium, thorium, beryllium, cadmium, things that you would not find naturally occurring.

498
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So it seems apparent to us that he was poisoned using radioisotopes.

499
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And so I would like to dedicate this presentation to the memory of my friend James Allen.

500
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
He's a brilliant young man, had a great potential as a filmmaker ahead of him.

501
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And I thank him for the time that he dedicated to documenting what I did.

502
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:26,000
On April 13, 2021, at the age of 69, Mark was found dead in his home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

503
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That day of April 13, Mark had spoken to his friend Rick Price and told him he would call him later.

504
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Mark additionally spoke to his girlfriend and told her he would speak to her when he arrived to work at her animal shelter.

505
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:47,000
According to Robert D. Morningstar, Mark was supposed to testify to elements of the Senate on UAP in June of 2021 and had been in contact with Senator Rubio.

506
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Was Mark's death truly his choice?

507
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I am reminded of what Brad told me when I asked about Mark's death.

508
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Quote,

509
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Mark McCandlish was a stupid, dramatic, selfish fool who died because he could not keep his mouth shut.

510
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Learn from this, end quote.

511
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Why was Mark allowed to investigate and speak on the ARV from 1988 to 2021?

512
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Was testifying to the Senate, possibly including Rubio and the gang of eight, the final straw?

513
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I am again reminded of Brad's words, quote.

514
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I protected him until I could not, end quote.

515
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Hey guys, I know we ended on a very somber tone, so I would just like to take a moment to dedicate this video to the memory of James Allen and Mark McCandlish.

516
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Without Mark's work and James Allen's work, none of this would have been possible.

517
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I'd also highly recommend watching the 2004 documentary, Zero Point, and the story of the Fluxliner, as well as Stephen Greer's 2001 NPC and the interview with Mark titled Blueprint for a UFO.

518
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:56,000
If you didn't notice earlier, I would also highly recommend reading the 1990 interview with Bill Scott, the Senior Engineer of Aviation Week in Space Technology, and Brad Sorenson.

519
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Now, after that massive investigation, what do you guys think?

520
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I personally find the story of the ARV one of if the not most interesting stories in all of whatever you want to call it, ufology.

521
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Even before the Schellenberger article with immaculate constellation and the mention of ARV, there was something about the McCandlish story that always stuck out to me.

522
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The level of detail with which he described the Fluxliner as relayed by Brad.

523
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And now after finding this interview with Brad, some of these small intricacies that Mark would say, this is how Brad acted, you know, usually he was very animated and quite, you know, lively.

524
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And then in the interview with Bill Scott, we see, you know, Brad using foul language and being very descriptive.

525
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I took special note of him kind of making fun of the designers of the ARV craft, saying clearly this was made by scientists, you know, Brad as an industrial designer and Mark as a designer.

526
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:07,000
They carry a certain swagger with their designs, sleek, beautiful, you know, especially Brad as coming from a car designer background, him just making fun of these scientists, saying it was clearly made by them.

527
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Clearly made by them.

528
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Now, I think the most shocking part of Brad's testimony in the 1990 interview is the statement of how these individuals in charge of the ARV got their hands on the craft.

529
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Copy the technology couldn't figure out how it worked from somewhere in 1947 with others with beings that tried to take their technology off the board for humans.

530
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It wasn't meant for us.

531
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:50,000
This harkens back to many stories in ufology about the Roswell craft, about humans getting their hands on technology forcefully and stories in the private sector about companies and scientists, not necessarily knowing how exactly these craft function.

532
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And thus we get a poor man's copy in the ARV.

533
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You know, we have these off shelf components, the synthetic vision system, the jump seat, the radial oxygen tanks.

534
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
It's quite interesting.

535
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I also found it quite puzzling how Brad says he doesn't know who these craft belong to or what exactly they're for and report to.

536
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:21,000
You know, part of me thinks they wondering about the secret space program, the craft as Mark decided or described as possibly taking samples.

537
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:38,000
If for these kind of black budget operations, which may function in sort of a closed loop, you know, there are stories of these places, these places, facilities, programs operating in cash transactions and utilizing analog computers to completely stay off the books.

538
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You know, one would must think how do these programs get their hands on materials, raw materials, metals, composite materials, you know, rare earth elements, lithium.

539
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
You know, this begs the question, what if these ARV craft?

540
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:05,000
What if one of their primary responsibilities is to, you know, visit the asteroid belt or near earth objects and kind of retrieve metals, precious metals for these programs to operate and continue their research and continue their development?

541
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I'm just spitballing here.

542
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Of course, the reality is probably much stranger, especially when we factor in stories to Edgar Foush and the TR3B for troop transport and logistics.

543
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You know, does this secret space program have some sort of station across our solar system?

544
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I also want to remove this secret space program away from sort of the more Corey Good 20 and back type stories.

545
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Of course, some of these claims are quite fantastical, especially with Corey Good, the 20 and back story, which is essentially a story of indentured servitude to work side alongside extraterrestrials and humans in a space program.

546
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Corey Good, the manufacturer of the story actually detailed these lies under oath.

547
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
So let's separate from those and we can take a much more grounded analysis to the secret space program.

548
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Part of it may be for nuclear superiority in the secret space program talk.

549
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Mark talked that the Aurora craft was actually a part of this program and the Aurora, you know, may have its place in this program due to the nuclear strike capabilities as Brad described.

550
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And they could destroy any city in the Soviet Union with a population over one million in under two hours.

551
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So how interesting is this, the combination of Mark McCandless's ARV with the entire testimony of Brad.

552
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Now that we have words from Brad's mouth, you know, forget the guys of death threats towards me telling me that to say goodbye to everybody I love,

553
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
which to be quite honest, I wouldn't get too hard on Brad about this.

554
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I think if anything, he's just probably trying to ward off amateur investigators off this case because there is a real and present danger here.

555
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But being able to look at the story through Brad's words, you know, I can only think of two differences between Brad's and Mark's stories.

556
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:02,000
One of these in the secret space program talk, Mark spoke that the craft wasn't made of too much metal that most of it was composite materials.

557
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
In the interview with Brad, he mentioned that a lot, a lot of metal was used.

558
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So this may have just been something that evolved over time, you know, maybe Brad thought the filaments on the crew compartment and composite materials were in fact metal and so forth.

559
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Also, Brad stated in the interview, there wasn't many stars, so general ships there, but this was in relation to the first interview with some of the terrestrial craft.

560
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:34,000
He didn't actually specify if the generals were were present for the ARV demonstration, that interview, which Mark said the three star general was demonstrating the flight capabilities on the videotape.

561
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So yeah, guys, we have the full story of ARV and this is just one facet of ARV.

562
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
We also have the full TR3B investigation dating back to Edgar Foush to go down.

563
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And then we have a whole array of vehicles purported to be using NHI technology to some extent from artificial intelligence to full components and propulsion systems.

564
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And I think there's a total of 10 to 15 of these alleged craft, of course, three of them being the flux liner, the Aurora craft and the mind skipping a blank here, the TR3B.

565
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But we have plenty more to investigate with ARV.

566
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
This isn't just McCandlish, but this story was made famous by McCandlish.

567
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So when Schellenberger mentions the story of ARV in the whistleblower report, I immediately think of these crude, jello saucers with jaggedy flight dynamics.

568
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That can travel faster than light speeds.

569
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Now, this is a very serious topic, guys.

570
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't want to draw any attention to Mark's grieving family.

571
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And of course, James Allen's presumably still grieving family, but it was worth kind of highlighting the strangeness around these passings, especially Mark possibly being, you know, set to testify in June of 2021 before congressional and Senate elements.

572
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It begs the question.

573
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Did Brad's protection of Mark, in whatever capacity and whatever facet that was, run out when Mark decided to testify before Congress?

574
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Was it all fine and dandy for him to be running around with Greer and saying these things in documentaries and having fun, but as soon as it came time for him to be subpoenaed or to swear this under testimony that that was enough?

575
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I don't know, but so much respect to Mark.

576
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
What a beautiful soul.

577
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:31,000
During these past couple weeks, I've got to watch dozens, if not 50 plus hours of Mark speaking, and he truly was a great loss to humanity.

578
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
What a beautiful artist.

579
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
What a beautiful, eloquent person.

580
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And thank you, James Allen again for making such a beautiful documentary.

581
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
With this episode, guys, I hope you enjoyed it.

582
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
This was one of my favorite investigations ever to create.

583
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And with that being said, please remember to like and subscribe.

584
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I have a Patreon.

585
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I don't gatekeep any content there.

586
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000

Oh, wait, real fast.

589
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I do plan to attend the November 13th hearings and the Soul Foundation, so I should have live coverage from those boots on the ground.

590
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But anyways, guys, with that being said, thank you so much for joining and I will catch you all in the next show.

591
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Bye.
