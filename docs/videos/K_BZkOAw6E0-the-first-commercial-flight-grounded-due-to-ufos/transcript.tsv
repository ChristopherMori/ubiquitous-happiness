0	4560	Many commercial pilots throughout the history of aviation have witnessed UFOs,
4560	9000	but unfortunately discussing their encounters has been historically taboo
9000	14720	and met with the same cancerous stigma that meets all of ufology. Today I wanted
14720	21000	to talk about the most famous UFO case in Spain, the Manisei incident, because what
21000	25800	if I told you about a UFO sighting a pilot couldn't ignore? In fact this sighting
25800	31240	was so prominent it led to the first ever commercial flight being grounded due
31240	38000	to UFOs. Guys it is UAPGurb I am back to analyze some more of the most interesting
38000	44760	UFO cases and encounters throughout history. Today the 1979 Manisei incident
44760	50320	where the sighting of UFOs caused a commercial flight to be grounded and
50320	55560	fighter jets to be scrambled. Now I'm going to use some of the original audio
55560	61680	of this sighting from the actual pilots in this incident, but upon my search I
61680	66560	found a channel called MPC Flight Recreations who actually incorporated
66560	71800	the original audio with an edit of what this flight and encounter may have
71800	74960	looked like. So I'm going to use some of his clips and I'm going to include his
74960	78640	video link down in the video description. Highly recommend checking that video in
78640	84960	his channel out because it's pretty cool. On November 11th 1979 pilot Javier
84960	91760	Laredo de Tejeda was forced to make an emergency landing of his TAE Super
91760	98560	Caravell and 109 passengers at the Manisei airport in Valencia Spain. This
98560	102920	emergency landing was not due to mechanical failures or rowdy passengers
102920	107440	but because of the pilots fear of colliding with a pair of strange red
107480	113360	lights in the sky. Javier's flight departed the island of Malorca after a
113360	118280	refueling stop for the craft's voyage from Salzburg Austria to La Palmas
118280	123880	near 2247 hours. It's worth mentioning the other men in the cockpit of this
123880	130600	Super Caravell, co-pilot Jose Ram√≥n, Zouaza Nagore and flight mechanic
130600	137600	Francisco Javier Rodriguez. At roughly 2305 hours over the Mediterranean the
137600	142120	flight mechanic warned the crew of two visible powerful red lights to the front
142120	148440	left of the airplane at an altitude of near 23,000 feet.
160600	174480	The crew radioed to air traffic control in Barcelona to determine the source of
174480	179800	the lights but were told there were no other aircraft on or near Captain Javier's
179800	208520	flight path. The pair of red lights appear to draw closer to the aircraft.
209040	214920	The men were able to discern the strange lights as two powerful sources of light
214920	220800	with no visible solid body. When changing altitude to avoid any sort of collision
220800	225680	with the lights the pair mirrored the craft's new trajectory and stayed less
225680	228680	than half a mile to five miles away from the plane.
239520	244520	If you have a new seat, can you tell me if the lights are on the sea or on the air?
254520	258520	The craft's new traffic is close to normal for now.
260520	265520	It's not moving at all now, it's 5-0, the traffic is going to be between 2-3-1-6.
268520	283520	The vectoring of the lights towards the aircraft alongside the fact no other
283520	288520	aircraft were operating in the area, Captain Javier aborted the flight and made an
288520	291520	emergency landing at the Manisace Airport in Valencia.
319520	325520	He rationalized flying near the UFO completely violating all aerial safety
325520	329520	rules alongside the inability to make an evasive maneuver in the event of a
329520	337520	collision was not worth the risk of his crew and 109 passengers. Just prior to the
337520	343520	emergency landing, the crew detected three new UFO signals on radar, each with
343520	348520	an estimated diameter of 200 meters. It's worth noting these lights were
348520	352520	witnessed by Manisace Airport personnel as well as military personnel
352520	358520	specifically Marines on the nearby Manisace Air Force Base. Due to one of these
358520	363520	signatures passing close to the airport runways, emergency lights were lit by
363520	369520	land crew if by some slim possibility, the UFO was actually an errant aircraft
369520	375520	experiencing technical difficulties. Due to multiple sightings of these anomalous
375520	380520	lights, Captain Fernando Camaro was soon dispatched from the nearby Lozianos Air
380520	388520	Base in a Mirage F1 to identify the mysterious UFOs at 040 hours. Here, the
388520	394520	pilot experienced equally or even more extraordinary events than that of crew
394520	402520	TAE JK 297. Camaro was forced to increase his speed to 1.4 Mach or 1,074
402520	407520	miles per hour just to make visual contact with an object he perceived as a
407520	413520	truncated cone shape displaying a bright, changing color. Despite his efforts to
413520	418520	approach the object, it quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was then informed of
418520	424520	a new radar echo indicating another object may be near Segunto. The pilot took
424520	428520	multiple pursuit vectors to approach the second object including traveling over
428520	433520	the Mediterranean and the nearby Spanish inland territories just to have the object
433520	439520	quickly dart away as he approached. Eventually, as Camaro neared the UFO, it
439520	445520	seemingly responded, acknowledging his fighter jet. It was at this time the pilot
445520	450520	had his avionics scrambled. The Mirage F1's electronic flight systems were jammed
450520	455520	and the onboard alert system warned Camaro he was actively locked on by a
455520	461520	continuous wave missile radar. The UFO then rapidly accelerated away towards
461520	467520	mainland Africa. After nearly an hour and a half of pursuit and dangerously low on
467520	474520	fuel, the pilot returned to base. This sighting took Spain by storm, reaching
474520	480520	its parliament in September of 1980. After some representatives asked for an
480520	485520	official explanation, it's unfortunate that the sighting was dismissed as a series
485520	492520	of freak optical illusions. Okay, so let's review the facts of our case.
492520	498520	TAE flight JK297 observed a set of red lights approaching their aircraft. After
498520	503520	changing their altitude from 23,000 feet to avoid any collisions with the craft,
503520	508520	the object matched the aircraft's trajectory and maintained a distance of 0.5
508520	513520	to 5 miles. Due to safety concerns of the crew, the flight decides to perform an
513520	519520	emergency landing. Shortly before the emergency landing, two more UFOs appear
519520	525520	with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. One object flies close to the nearby
525520	530520	airstrip so on-ground employees turn on emergency lighting in case a rogue aircraft
530520	536520	is in trouble. Multiple marine air-based personnel witness strange moving
536520	542520	lights in the sky. A Mirage F1 is dispatched to investigate and must travel
542520	548520	1.4 Mach to even approach near the object. The pilot observes a conical shape
548520	553520	before it rapidly accelerates out of sight. The pilot is ordered to pursue a
553520	558520	second signature which, when close, actively scrambles his avionics equipment
558520	563520	and onboard sensors. Please note that Kamara also states the object jammed
563520	570520	his attempts to lock onto it with an IR missile. Now what stands out to me most
570520	576520	about this case is not the crew aborting its flight path due to UFOs, but
576520	582520	actually the sensory equipment failure of the Mirage F1. Believe me, this
582520	588520	jamming has occurred multiple times in public UFO military cases. Everyone
588520	592520	knows the story of Commander David Fravers' tic-tac sighting in 04 off the
592520	598520	coast of San Diego. Did you know he says that the object's plural actively jam
598520	603520	the radar and sensory equipment of the jets? And even more interesting, let's
603520	611520	take a look at the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. This famous encounter details
611520	618520	the experience of Major Parviz Jafari of the Imperial Iranian Air Force. In 1976
618520	623520	he was one of two jets dispatched to intercept a UFO that had been detected
623520	629520	hovering over Tehran in his F4 Phantom 2 jet. The first of the two pilots lost
629520	632520	all instruments and communication abilities when approaching the object
632520	637520	so he was forced to turn back. Ten minutes later, Jafari was scrambled to
637520	642520	intercept the UFO. While traveling at Mach 1, the Major observed the object
642520	649520	70 miles out, instantaneously jumped 10 degrees to his right. At this distance,
649520	657520	the craft performed an instantaneous 26-mile jump in under a second. While
657520	662520	approaching the seemingly diamond-shaped UFO, a smaller, spherical object
662520	668520	separated from it and approached the F4 Phantom 2. Jafari's only instinct was
668520	672520	to engage the smaller object with his weaponry, but when attempting to target
672520	676520	the object, all of its instruments on board, including targeting and radio,
676520	682520	went haywire. Frightening Jafari tremendously, he made the decision to
682520	688520	emergency exit if the object approached within two miles of him. The pilot
688520	692520	then performed evasive maneuvers to fly away from the object, where his
692520	697520	instrumentation returned to normal and he regained contact with aerial command.
697520	702520	This Tehran incident is one of my favorite encounters, and soon I'd like to
702520	707520	make a video on global Air Force UFO encounters, but I just wanted to throw
707520	710520	that in as another instance in which a military fighter jet experienced
710520	717520	total instrument failure when engaging a UFO. Like with any credible sighting,
717520	722520	with multiple eyewitnesses and multi-sensory data, we need to visit the
722520	728520	Midwest-level debunk panel. So for this specific case, apparently the lights
728520	734520	the Super Caravelle saw in 1979 were the lights of the combustion towers of
734520	741520	the Escobrera refinery near Cartagena. This stationary lights do not account
741520	746520	for the fact the trained pilots said that the lights approached their aircraft
746520	751520	and maintained altitude while they performed evasive maneuvers and maintained
751520	757520	a close distance the aircraft of 0.5 to 5 miles. Apparently these lights sent
757520	763520	the captain into an anxiety attack, forcing him to land the plane and as
763520	768520	well as the co-pilot and flight mechanic, they did not seem to argue with this
768520	773520	rationale and they must have been inflicted with anxiety attacks as well.
773520	779520	The moving lights that were seen by multiple menace airport personnel and
779520	784520	nearby Marines, as well as the UFO that was seen near the airstrip, thus the
784520	789520	emergency lighting was turned on in case there was a rogue aircraft, is apparently
789520	796520	stars, planets, the same thing with every case. Everything just boils down to
796520	800520	trained pilots and trained observers or people on the ground misconstruing
800520	805520	Venus or Jupiter as a UFO, even though these lights are flashing multi-colored
805520	812520	move or are a craft that are identifiable. The Mirage F1 explanation is both
812520	818520	the most comical and most reasonable at the same time. At this time in 1979,
818520	824520	the Iranian hostage crisis was being resolved and stationed near the
824520	829520	Mediterranean was the US 6th Fleet. The scrambling of the instrumentation is said
829520	836520	due to powerful electronic scrambling signatures on board to LHP to Iwo Jima
836520	844520	helicopter carriers. However, pilot Fernando Kamara rejects this explanation stating
844520	849520	that he was both too far away from this fleet to interfere with his flight
849520	855520	navigation, radio, emergency control, so forth. And this doesn't account for the
855520	860520	truncated cone shape that he witnessed with his own eyes as well as a craft that
860520	865520	would speed away from him as he would approach it going 1.4 Mach. Furthermore,
865520	871520	this explanation of the 6th Fleet does not explain the instance on which he
871520	877520	tried to lock onto the UFO with an IR missile, where his systems were actively
877520	884520	jammed. So to summarize that debunk panel, we have a confusion of stars. We have
884520	888520	a refinery tower that a trained pilot gets an anxiety attack and must land his
888520	897520	plane. And we have a pilot who is seen in a mirage with his own eyes and his jet.
897520	906520	And it's just a US fleet. That's who knows how nearby. So to me at least that
906520	911520	debunk panel doesn't hold up. I think that's a lot of coincidences at once that
911520	916520	just does not stand up to me. I think this case is incredibly interesting and I
916520	921520	think it is one of the world's most interesting cases. And it is, no matter how
921520	925520	you look at it, true or false, the first recorded story of a commercial airliner
925520	930520	being grounded due to a sighting of a UFO. But what do you think on this case?
930520	934520	Have you heard about this case? Because it flies kind of under the radar to me,
934520	938520	but it is Spain's most famous UFO case. If you've heard of it, let me know when
938520	941520	did you hear about it? What do you think about it? If you haven't, what do you think
941520	945520	about it? Think it's real? Or do you think it's fake? Or do you think it's an
945520	951520	anxiety attack by a pilot and multiple eyewitnesses being confused? And I guess
951520	956520	the similarities between that and the 1976 Tehran incident with the Mirage jet
956520	962520	are just bad a coincidence. But I'll be fully transparent. I think this case is legitimate.
962520	966520	Thank you guys and I hope you enjoyed this short documentary, another one. I know
966520	969520	we're supposed to be on our iceberg part three and that will become and I just
969520	972520	have been struck with some inspiration lately to make some of these documentary
972520	977520	cases. I think they're fascinating. I have a ton more. I want to make a sort of
977520	982520	global Air Force UFO encounter video pretty soon. I have some interesting cases
982520	987520	from the U.S. Peru as well and all over the world. So stay tuned. Let me know in
987520	991520	the comments what kind of video you want to see next. Like and subscribe to the
991520	993520	channel and I'll catch you guys next time.
