    "description": "A dive into Ph.D. Physicist Kevin Knuth's exploration of UAP physics. From his 2023 SOL Foundation talk to his 2019 published paper \"Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles\", Knuth tackles what academia claims is impossible - calculating instances of UAP travel speeds, luminosity, experienced G forces, and more. \n\nKnuth aims his focus towards the Minot AFB encounter, Nimitz encounter based on FLIR footage/Fravor Testimony/radar detection, and the 1986 JAL case. Through his research and calculations, Knuth derives travel speeds and G forces that far exceed any capabilities of modern-day engineering and material science. \n\nFortunately, the professor tackles only cases with multi-sensor data - radar + eyewitness + video. This strategic, scientific approach allows Knuth to apply the same rigorous academic approach applied to physics to UAP study.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:53 Kevin Knuth\n4:02 UFO Images\n7:20 Sudden/Instantaneous Acceleration, Hypersonic Velocity Without Signatures\n9:11 Hermann Oberth\n10:54 Minot AFB\n12:26 1986 JAL Encounter\n15:11 Space Travel Analysis\n15:38 Luminosity \n16:36 Magnetic/Electric Fields\n18:10 USO\n19:52 Conclusion\n\nEstimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles: https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/physics_fac_scholar/58/\n\nSOL Foundation talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlYwktOj75A \n\n1971 Costa Rica Image: http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/topphotos/Photo303.htm\n\n2003 Weyauwega, Wisconsin Images: http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/topphotos/Photo9.htm\n\n2005 Vancouver, BC Images: http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/recent/Photo401.htm\n\n2007 Green Bay, Wisconsin Images: http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/recent/Photo416.htm\n\n1958 Trindade, Brazil Images: http://w ww.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/oldest/Photo300.htm\n\n\"Flying Saucers Come From a Different World\" Hermann Oberth: http://sohp.us/collections/ufos-a-history/pdf/GROSS-1954-Oct.pdf\n\n1954 Oberth Flight Calculations: http://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/Australia/Australian UFO Bulletin/Australian UFO Bulletin - 1991 09 - September.pdf\n\n1968 Minot AFB Files: \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190701165535/http:/ufohastings.com/storage/files/image/2010-10-11/minot_afb_1966-08-25_01.jpg\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190701184102/http:/ufohastings.com/storage/files/image/2010-10-11/minot_afb_1966-08-25_02.jpg\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20220915015534*/http:/ufohastings.com/storage/files/image/2010-10-11/minot_afb_1966-08-25_03.jpg\n\nMusic By the Always Talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg\n\n#ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker #kingman #ufocrash #nickredfern #Knuth #phyiscs",
