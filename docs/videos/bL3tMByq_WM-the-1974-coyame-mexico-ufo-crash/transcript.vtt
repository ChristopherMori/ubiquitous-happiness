WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.400
In fact, many countries around the world have stories of crashes of non-human intelligence

00:07.400 --> 00:12.680
that rival the intrigue, cover-up, and credibility of the infamous crash that occurred in the

00:12.680 --> 00:15.600
New Mexico Desert in 1947.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.920
Whether this be Shag Harbor Canada, Maje Brazil, or others, tantalizing and perplexing stories

00:20.920 --> 00:24.920
of UFO crashes are not isolated to the United States.

00:24.920 --> 00:31.520
So today, let's investigate a severely underexplored UFO retrieval case that may give us the greatest

00:31.520 --> 00:36.840
insights into U.S. craft recovery protocol that allegedly occurred in northern Mexico

00:36.840 --> 00:41.440
in Coyame, Chihuahua, in the summer of 1974.

00:41.440 --> 00:45.960
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so much for joining me today as we dive into a

00:45.960 --> 00:51.760
gripping and underrepresented crash retrieval case commonly referred to by authors as Mexico's

00:51.760 --> 00:53.040
Roswell.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.840
This case features an astounding tale to rival any case of a downed UAP, a classic crash

00:58.840 --> 01:04.560
disk, U.S. Special Forces recovery, a mysterious leaked report describing the event, the death

01:04.560 --> 01:09.000
of the Mexican military retrieval force, and much, much more.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.040
Is this case that has hardly seen any covering factor fiction?

01:13.040 --> 01:16.160
Join me today as we try and find out.

01:16.160 --> 01:21.120
And before we get started, it is worth noting primary sources for this case are few and

01:21.120 --> 01:22.480
far between.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.960
I will primarily be referencing the work of authors and first-hand investigators into

01:26.960 --> 01:33.280
the Coyame case, Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte and their book, Mexico's Roswell, the Chihuahua

01:33.280 --> 01:39.080
UFO Crash, and follow-up piece, The Coyome Incident, as well as Leonard Stringfield's

01:39.080 --> 01:45.080
UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report 7 Part 9, and Ryan S. Wood's masterpiece, Magic Eyes

01:45.080 --> 01:49.600
Only, which gives this case a medium to high level of authenticity.

01:53.400 --> 02:00.840
In the early 1980s, whispers of a 1974 collision between a small private plane and disk-shaped

02:00.840 --> 02:05.680
UFO occurring near Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico began circulating.

02:05.680 --> 02:10.140
Tales of dead Mexican soldiers who initially recovered the craft in an American recovering

02:10.140 --> 02:15.600
team who relieved the corpses of the craft wreckage began to rise and follow these whispers.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.400
In 1994, legendary UFO crash retrieval researcher Leonard Stringfield would state, quote,

02:21.520 --> 02:27.080
I heard of the Chihuahua case before, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.160
The only detail I vaguely recall is that the U.S. military team had covertly crossed into

02:32.160 --> 02:35.000
Mexico to retrieve the object, end quote.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.600
It wasn't until 1992 on an electronic bulletin board, an anomalous document titled, quote,

02:41.600 --> 02:46.340
Research Finding on Chihuahua Disk Crash, end quote, would be posted, commonly referred

02:46.340 --> 02:50.960
to as the Dineb Report, which we will discuss in much greater detail later.

02:50.960 --> 02:55.600
This shadowy, possibly leaked or purposefully leaked memo of unknown origin details the

02:55.600 --> 03:00.000
communications of one J.S. to all Dineb team members.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.960
In early summer of 1993, paper copies of this document would be mailed anonymously to UFO

03:05.960 --> 03:10.320
researchers such as Elaine Douglas, who shared the original documents with Stringfield.

03:10.320 --> 03:14.840
This anonymous mailing to select researchers reminds me strongly of the origins of the

03:14.840 --> 03:16.200
MJ-12 documents.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.840
The Dineb Report serves as our primary document describing this case.

03:19.840 --> 03:24.520
I find it crucial to read this document in its entirety as it serves as the greatest

03:24.520 --> 03:27.200
analysis of this mysterious case.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.080
Afterwards, we will investigate some of the key aspects of this report and event further,

03:32.080 --> 03:38.400
so without further ado, let's dive right into this 1974 recovery story.

03:38.400 --> 03:46.400
To all Dineb team members from J.S. date, 23rd March 1992, subject, Research Findings

03:46.400 --> 03:49.640
on the Chihuahua Disk Crash, text.

03:49.640 --> 03:56.920
In 25 Augs 74 at 2207 hours, U.S. air defense radar detected an unknown approaching U.S.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.280
airspace from the Gulf of Mexico.

03:59.280 --> 04:06.280
Originally, the object was tracked at 2200 knots on a bearing of 325 degrees and an altitude

04:06.280 --> 04:12.360
of 75,000 feet, a course that would intercept U.S. territory about 40 miles southwest of

04:12.360 --> 04:14.480
Corpus Christi, Texas.

04:14.480 --> 04:19.640
After approximately 60 seconds of observation at a position of 155 miles southeast of Corpus

04:19.640 --> 04:25.840
Christi, the object simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots, turning to a

04:25.840 --> 04:29.440
heading of 290 degrees and began a slow descent.

04:29.440 --> 04:34.960
It entered Mexican airspace approximately 40 miles southwest of Brownsville, Texas.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.320
Radar attracted approximately 500 miles to a point near the town of Coyame in the state

04:39.320 --> 04:42.160
of Chihuahua not far from the U.S. border.

04:42.440 --> 04:46.320
There, the object suddenly disappeared from the radar screens.

04:46.320 --> 04:51.400
During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at 45,000 feet, then descended

04:51.400 --> 04:52.920
to 20,000 feet.

04:52.920 --> 04:58.120
The descent was in level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level was

04:58.120 --> 05:01.160
maintained for approximately 5 minutes.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.820
The object was tracked by two different military radar installations.

05:04.820 --> 05:08.720
It would have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it is assumed that no

05:08.760 --> 05:13.320
civilian radar detected the object due to a lack of any such reports.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.960
The point of disappearance from radar screens was over a barren and sparsely populated area

05:17.960 --> 05:19.380
of northern Mexico.

05:19.380 --> 05:23.560
At first, it was assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon, and

05:23.560 --> 05:26.760
a watch was kept for any reemergence of the object.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.920
None occurred.

05:27.920 --> 05:32.000
At first, it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because of the high speed and

05:32.000 --> 05:36.960
descending flight path, but meteors normally travel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth

05:37.000 --> 05:39.200
arc, not in steps.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.320
And meteors do not normally make a 35 degree change in course.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.640
Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called.

05:46.640 --> 05:51.160
However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, the object turned to a course

05:51.160 --> 05:54.280
that would not immediately take it over US territory.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.880
The alert was called off within 20 minutes after the object's disappearance from the

05:57.880 --> 05:58.880
radar screen.

05:58.880 --> 06:04.040
52 minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic indicated that a civilian craft

06:04.160 --> 06:06.160
had gone down in that area.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.880
But it was clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso International with a

06:09.880 --> 06:14.200
destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have been tracked over the Gulf

06:14.200 --> 06:15.540
of Mexico.

06:15.540 --> 06:21.200
It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area at the same time.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.680
Within daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for the missing plane.

06:25.680 --> 06:30.120
Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radio report that records from the missing plane

06:30.120 --> 06:32.640
had been spotted from the air.

06:32.640 --> 06:37.800
Just immediately came a report of a second plane on the ground a few miles from the first.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.360
After a few minutes, an additional report stated the second plane was circular shaped

06:42.360 --> 06:45.320
and apparently in one piece, although damaged.

06:45.320 --> 06:50.880
A few minutes after that, the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts.

06:50.880 --> 06:55.880
The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two

06:55.880 --> 06:59.440
additional government agencies also received reports.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.280
But such has not been confirmed as of this date.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.840
The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.840
The speed with which this team and equipment was assembled suggests that this was either

07:09.840 --> 07:15.160
a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event.

07:15.160 --> 07:20.000
In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States

07:20.000 --> 07:24.360
and Mexican government that the U.S. recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to

07:24.360 --> 07:26.680
quote-unquote assist.

07:26.680 --> 07:31.800
These reports were met with professional ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation.

07:31.800 --> 07:39.320
By 2100 hours, 26 AUG 74, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort Bliss.

07:39.320 --> 07:44.720
Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured area.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.360
These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.

07:49.360 --> 07:54.720
Eyewitness indicates that there are three smaller craft, very probably UH-1 Hueys from

07:54.720 --> 07:56.160
the description.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.200
There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a sea stallion.

08:00.200 --> 08:05.400
All from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Fort Bliss personnel.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.440
Satellite and Recognizant's aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crash disc

08:10.440 --> 08:16.400
and civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded onto flatbed trucks.

08:16.400 --> 08:21.240
Later flights confirmed the convoy had departed the area heading south.

08:21.240 --> 08:26.360
At that point, the CIA had to make a choice, either to allow this unknown aircraft to stay

08:26.360 --> 08:31.360
in the hands of the Mexican government or to launch the recovery team, supplemented by

08:31.360 --> 08:35.040
any required military support to take the craft.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.040
There occurred, however, an event that took the choice out of their hands.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.840
High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited

08:43.840 --> 08:46.160
areas or major roads.

08:46.160 --> 08:51.200
Recogn showed no activity and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters

08:51.200 --> 08:52.600
had ceased.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.840
At low altitude, high-speed overflight was ordered.

08:55.840 --> 09:00.720
The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with doors

09:00.720 --> 09:05.680
open and two human bodies laying on the ground beside the two vehicles.

09:05.680 --> 09:10.040
The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team, but the actual launching

09:10.040 --> 09:14.960
was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel.

09:14.960 --> 09:20.000
It was not until 1438 hours that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.760
The four helicopters followed the border down to Bercito, then turned and entered Mexican

09:24.760 --> 09:27.360
airspace north of Candelaria.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.160
They were over the convoy site at 1653 hours.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.400
All convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.280
Some recovery team members dressed in bioprotection suits reconfigured the straps holding the

09:40.280 --> 09:46.460
object onto the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the sea stallion.

09:46.460 --> 09:51.820
By 1714 hours, the recovered object was on its way to US territory.

09:51.820 --> 09:56.080
Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery team gathered together the Mexican

09:56.080 --> 10:01.700
vehicle and bodies, then destroyed all with high explosives.

10:01.700 --> 10:05.780
This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air

10:05.780 --> 10:06.980
collision.

10:06.980 --> 10:10.380
At 1746 hours, the Hueys departed.

10:10.380 --> 10:14.620
The Hueys caught up with the sea stallion as it re-entered US airspace.

10:14.620 --> 10:19.980
The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately 25 miles

10:19.980 --> 10:21.660
northeast of Valentine.

10:21.660 --> 10:26.580
There, they landed and waited until 0-2-5 hours the next morning.

10:26.580 --> 10:31.260
At that time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with the small convoy on the road

10:31.260 --> 10:33.740
besides Van Horn and Kent.

10:33.740 --> 10:38.420
The recovered disc was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being

10:38.420 --> 10:40.420
sealed totally.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.940
Some of the personnel from the Hueys transferred to the convoy.

10:43.940 --> 10:49.100
All helicopters then returned to their original basis for decontamination procedures.

10:49.100 --> 10:54.220
The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways and staying away

10:54.220 --> 10:55.660
from cities.

10:55.660 --> 11:00.700
The destination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.820
Here the hard evidence thins out.

11:02.820 --> 11:08.780
One unconfirmed report says the disc was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

11:08.780 --> 11:13.180
Another says that the disc was either transferred after that to another unnamed base or was

11:13.180 --> 11:17.100
taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta.

11:17.100 --> 11:22.860
The best description of this disc was that it was 16 feet 5 inches in diameter, convex

11:22.860 --> 11:29.540
on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows.

11:29.540 --> 11:32.380
The thickness was slightly less than 5 feet.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.660
The color was silver, much like polished steel.

11:35.660 --> 11:40.220
There were no visible lights nor any propulsion means, there were no markings.

11:40.220 --> 11:43.340
There were two areas of the rim that showed damage.

11:43.340 --> 11:48.420
One showing in a regular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal around

11:48.420 --> 11:49.420
it.

11:49.420 --> 11:54.260
The other damage was described as a quote-unquote dent, about 2 feet wide.

11:54.260 --> 12:00.180
The weight of the object was estimated as approximately 1,500 pounds, based on the effect

12:00.180 --> 12:04.460
of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck.

12:04.460 --> 12:08.980
There was no indication in the document available as to whether anything else was visible in

12:08.980 --> 12:11.100
the quote-unquote hole.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.860
It seemed likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the

12:14.860 --> 12:16.660
civilian craft.

12:16.660 --> 12:24.060
That collision occurred while the object was traveling at approximately 1,955 miles per

12:24.060 --> 12:25.300
hour.

12:25.300 --> 12:29.500
Even ignoring the speed of the civilian craft, the impact would have been considerable at

12:29.500 --> 12:30.860
that speed.

12:30.860 --> 12:35.220
This is an agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being quote, almost

12:35.220 --> 12:37.860
totally destroyed end quote.

12:37.860 --> 12:41.900
What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of the civilian craft.

12:41.900 --> 12:46.060
The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with the ground.

12:46.060 --> 12:50.580
The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact.

12:50.580 --> 12:54.300
No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian craft.

12:54.300 --> 12:58.260
It is not known if any body or bodies were discovered.

12:58.260 --> 13:02.420
Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies may well

13:02.420 --> 13:05.740
have not come down near the larger pieces.

13:05.740 --> 13:11.020
Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known.

13:11.020 --> 13:15.780
Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disc as a result of the damage to

13:15.780 --> 13:18.220
a microbiological agent.

13:18.220 --> 13:22.700
There are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.700
It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back

13:26.700 --> 13:30.660
with them for analysis, but there is no indication of that happening.

13:30.660 --> 13:34.980
Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what may have been a biologically

13:34.980 --> 13:36.900
contaminated body.

13:36.900 --> 13:42.940
Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because

13:42.940 --> 13:47.900
it does not involve a U.S. aircraft, nor did it occur over U.S. airspace.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.660
It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story.

13:51.660 --> 13:55.360
Nothing is known of the analysis of the craft nor its contents.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.820
Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign recovery team, nor is it

13:59.820 --> 14:03.060
known if this craft was manned or not.

14:03.060 --> 14:08.180
Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disc be taken to Atlanta, and where

14:08.180 --> 14:09.780
did the disc come from?

14:09.780 --> 14:15.180
It was first detected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U.S. air defenses

14:15.180 --> 14:18.060
extend to a much greater distance than that.

14:18.060 --> 14:22.940
If the object descended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD's space tracking has some record

14:22.940 --> 14:24.460
of the object.

14:24.460 --> 14:29.340
Alternate possibility is that it entered the Gulf of Mexico under radar limits, then, quote

14:29.340 --> 14:33.540
unquote, jumped up to 75,000 feet.

14:33.540 --> 14:38.340
Considering prior behavior exhibited by discs of this size, it is probable that the entry

14:38.340 --> 14:40.660
was from orbital altitude.

14:40.660 --> 14:45.380
The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness accounts.

14:45.380 --> 14:49.220
Documentation illegally copied and a partially destroyed document.

14:49.220 --> 14:53.380
This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.

14:53.380 --> 14:59.260
Only in February of this year did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group.

14:59.260 --> 15:06.180
End of document.

15:06.180 --> 15:11.300
Very little, and I mean very little, is known about the origins of this mysterious-to-never

15:11.300 --> 15:12.300
report.

15:12.300 --> 15:17.680
As mentioned above, the document first appeared on early message boards in 1992, before being

15:17.680 --> 15:22.340
anonymously mailed to researchers such as Elaine Douglas and Nick Redfern.

15:22.340 --> 15:27.100
Immediately, copies made their way into the hands of Leonard Stringfield in his sublime

15:27.100 --> 15:33.060
crash retrieval status report stating, quote, reviewing the text of the report initial JS

15:33.060 --> 15:38.580
which follows, I find that it is authoritatively written, using correct military terminology

15:38.580 --> 15:45.220
and of note and unlike a hoax, draws the line between so-called hard evidence and that which

15:45.220 --> 15:46.980
is speculative, end quote.

15:46.980 --> 15:51.500
What is crucial to remember here is Stringfield had heard rumors of this case around a decade

15:51.500 --> 15:56.660
prior, and let's note in Stringfield's own words, when presenting his initial retrievals

15:56.740 --> 16:03.340
of the third kind at Mufon in 1978, he was, quote, unquote, informed circuitously by the

16:03.340 --> 16:05.940
CIA several days in advance.

16:05.940 --> 16:12.300
It would be inadvisable for him to discuss crash information in Mexico or West Germany.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.940
So the author of this piece, JS, seems to have intimate knowledge gathered by primary

16:16.940 --> 16:21.620
sources about the incident and desired the release of evidence to interested parties,

16:21.620 --> 16:23.620
i.e. the Deneb team.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.300
Is JS an acronym or a name?

16:26.340 --> 16:31.380
While Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte hypothesize JS is an acronym for a department within the

16:31.380 --> 16:36.780
US government, such as joint staff or joint services, perhaps the Deneb team was a name

16:36.780 --> 16:41.940
for an internal USG investigation group during the, quote, unquote, dark ages of UAP, as

16:41.940 --> 16:43.540
I like to call them.

16:43.540 --> 16:48.740
We know there is a massive gap of any official UAP programs within USG, from the ending of

16:48.740 --> 16:55.140
Blue Book in 1969 to the creation of ASAP slash ATIP in 2007, and from the words of

16:55.180 --> 17:01.420
Lu Elizondo, we do know unknown UAP programs were operating in the 1980s.

17:01.420 --> 17:06.340
Or with recent revelations of the UAP task force utilizing top secret online forums

17:06.340 --> 17:12.340
to discuss UAP, maybe the Deneb team was a similar group of intelligence community professionals

17:12.340 --> 17:17.260
who used the early internet message boards to discuss obfuscated data on crash retrieval

17:17.260 --> 17:18.500
cases.

17:18.500 --> 17:24.340
What is also interesting to note is the, quote, file UFO 3263, and, quote, indicating the

17:24.340 --> 17:28.860
Koyame report is one of many studied by Deneb and JS.

17:28.860 --> 17:33.780
Whether JS is an individual or group with intimate knowledge into the Koyome incident,

17:33.780 --> 17:39.380
it seems the author does not have a direct line of information from the named CIA, NORAD,

17:39.380 --> 17:43.660
or other agencies we kind of guess, such as the NRO or NGA.

17:43.660 --> 17:49.660
The facts were, quote, gathered from two eyewitness accounts, documentation illegally copied and

17:49.660 --> 17:51.820
a partially destroyed document.

17:51.820 --> 17:55.500
This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.

17:55.500 --> 18:00.740
Only in February of this year, 1992, did the notes and documents come into the hands of

18:00.740 --> 18:02.340
our group, end quote.

18:02.340 --> 18:08.140
JS even states multiple times, he or they are unaware of the analysis of the craft,

18:08.140 --> 18:13.420
the craft's ultimate destination, and other details such as the inclusion of bodies.

18:13.420 --> 18:18.620
Deneb itself is a highly luminous blue star originated in the constellation Cygnus, one

18:18.620 --> 18:22.740
of the eldest constellations recognized by early civilizations.

18:22.740 --> 18:28.860
The star is a supergiant with luminosity equal to 60,000 souls or Earth's suns.

18:28.860 --> 18:33.380
The Milky Way's Great Rift, a critical junction in the galaxy where the Milky Way splits into

18:33.380 --> 18:37.340
two long sides, begins near Deneb into Cygnus.

18:37.340 --> 18:42.980
This particular area held special significance to ancient stargazers, and of particular note,

18:42.980 --> 18:52.980
southern Mexico shamans who referred to the rift as Zibalba B, the birth of all life.

18:52.980 --> 18:58.740
The Deneb report describes an extremely unlikely chance of a collision between a UFO with a

18:58.740 --> 19:03.500
civilian light plane, which is one of the most key aspects to this case.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.820
According to the report, civilian air traffic had indicated the crash of a civilian aircraft

19:07.820 --> 19:11.620
along the route of El Paso, Texas to Mexico City.

19:11.620 --> 19:16.780
The Deneb team made inquiries into the FAA to identify the airport, but received no documents

19:16.780 --> 19:19.580
concluding the plane was of Mexican origin.

19:19.580 --> 19:25.060
And unfortunately, examining U.S. 1974 aircraft crashes such as aircraft accident reports

19:25.060 --> 19:29.180
from Embry Riddle University yields no results either.

19:29.180 --> 19:33.580
Aviation Safety Network additionally lists no crashes in the year of 1974 occurring in

19:33.580 --> 19:35.100
Mexico.

19:35.100 --> 19:39.500
Many researchers such as Torres and Uriarte believe the craft would have been a Cessna

19:39.500 --> 19:41.740
180 light aircraft.

19:41.740 --> 19:46.540
This is due to the last detection of the UFO by U.S. air defense radar at 20,000 feet

19:46.540 --> 19:47.540
or under.

19:47.540 --> 19:53.500
Since this aircraft has a service ceiling of 17,700 feet, the authors of Mexico's Roswell

19:53.500 --> 19:59.500
guessed the craft to be a perfect fit for a covert, low altitude, and slow speed craft.

19:59.500 --> 20:04.540
So if this case is real, that likely leaves us with a craft performing illegal operations

20:04.540 --> 20:08.620
in a Cessna 180 such as drug smuggling operations.

20:08.620 --> 20:14.940
In 1974, anti-drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico was an extremely pertinent issue.

20:14.940 --> 20:19.700
Let's reference this discussion between U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Mexican President

20:19.700 --> 20:25.660
that occurred on October 21, 1974, just two months after our crash story.

20:25.660 --> 20:31.020
The Mexican President states, quote, along the 3,000 kilometer border, it is very easy

20:31.020 --> 20:35.660
for small planes to take off and land in small private ranches.

20:36.060 --> 20:40.380
According to Torres and Uriartes' follow-up book to Mexico's Roswell the Coyame Incident,

20:40.380 --> 20:45.780
the two mentioned the August 1974 death of a 50-year-old Mexican pilot Enrique Riviera

20:45.780 --> 20:50.860
Gutierrez as reported in El Fronterizo of Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua.

20:50.860 --> 20:54.900
I've personally been unable to track this paper, but the authors discussed that the

20:54.900 --> 21:00.780
man died on August 30, 1974 from horrific injuries sustained in a plane crash on an

21:00.780 --> 21:03.220
unknown date prior to the article.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.860
The authors argue this could possibly be the pilot mentioned in the Dineb report, but

21:06.860 --> 21:12.780
I find that highly unlikely, due to the collision of a UFO and private plane at thousands of

21:12.780 --> 21:14.180
feet altitude.

21:14.180 --> 21:18.740
Beside some alleged aircraft parts discovered in the crash region by Torres and Uriartes,

21:18.740 --> 21:22.980
we really have nothing to work with here in terms of tracking down this plane.

21:27.980 --> 21:32.820
The Dineb reports makes numerous mention to the CIA, quote, the radio interceptions

21:32.820 --> 21:37.780
were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two additional government

21:37.780 --> 21:42.940
agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date.

21:42.940 --> 21:46.140
The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.

21:46.140 --> 21:50.060
The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that it was either

21:50.060 --> 21:55.300
a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event, end quote.

21:55.300 --> 21:59.380
I am once again drawn to this article by the incredible Christopher Sharpe, which accuses

21:59.460 --> 22:04.500
the CIA's Office of Global Access of playing a central role in UFO crash retrieval since

22:04.500 --> 22:06.100
2003.

22:06.100 --> 22:11.780
The article states the OGA coordinates with Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, amongst

22:11.780 --> 22:13.580
others to collect craft.

22:13.580 --> 22:18.340
The implication of the CIA and the Dineb report leads us to suspect departments within the

22:18.340 --> 22:24.060
CIA have engaged in crash retrievals far before the OGA's creation in 2003.

22:24.060 --> 22:31.620
And unfortunately, we can find CIA FOIA requests such as F-2007-00637 alleged mid-air collisions

22:31.620 --> 22:37.940
near Coyame, Mexico on 825 or 26 1974 with no results.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.580
However, we still do have some really interesting clues to pursue.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.980
The role of the OGA in UFO crash retrievals as described by Sharpe's anonymous source

22:45.980 --> 22:49.780
closely resembles the role of the CIA in the Dineb report.

22:49.780 --> 22:54.460
According to Sharpe's source, quote, they are basically a facilitator for people to get

22:54.460 --> 22:56.580
in and out of countries.

22:56.580 --> 23:01.300
They are very clever at being able to get anywhere in the world they want to, end quote.

23:01.300 --> 23:05.860
And an additional source of Sharpe stated, quote, the task at hand is simply to get into

23:05.860 --> 23:09.020
the custody and protect the secrecy of it.

23:09.020 --> 23:13.740
The actual physical retrieval is done by the military, but it's not kept under military

23:13.740 --> 23:18.740
control because they have to keep too many records, so they start moving it out fairly

23:18.740 --> 23:21.380
quickly into private hands, end quote.

23:21.380 --> 23:26.140
In the Dineb report, the CIA gathered intelligence on the UFO and assembled a recovery team who

23:26.140 --> 23:30.780
we will later learn may have all been retired U.S. armed forces.

23:30.780 --> 23:36.620
The UFO was then taken covertly by an unknown convoy to Atlanta, Georgia where, by the way,

23:36.620 --> 23:42.140
we can find a Lockheed Martin complex located in Air Force Plant 6, less than 30 miles outside

23:42.140 --> 23:43.140
of Atlanta.

23:43.140 --> 23:48.220
In Lockheed's own words, this location offers, quote, skunkworks work in advanced development,

23:48.220 --> 23:49.220
end quote.

23:49.220 --> 23:53.940
And while Lockheed Martin was founded in 1995, we can clearly see one of its precursors,

23:53.940 --> 23:59.860
the Lockheed Company, engaged in C-130 work in Marietta, Georgia since the 1950s.

23:59.860 --> 24:04.300
And what's even stranger here is the existence of the Lockheed Martin Georgia Nuclear Aircraft

24:04.300 --> 24:10.340
Laboratory known as AFP number 67, which served as Lockheed's lab for investigating the feasibility

24:10.340 --> 24:12.180
of nuclear aircraft.

24:12.180 --> 24:17.260
The site was closed in 1971 and acquired by the city of Atlanta, but this is still a very

24:17.260 --> 24:18.900
interesting connection.

24:18.900 --> 24:24.220
Two sources in the Daily Mail told Sharp, alongside JSOC, nuclear weapons experts such

24:24.220 --> 24:29.020
as the Nuclear Emergency Support Team or NEST perform retrieval operations.

24:29.020 --> 24:33.980
With this in mind, the Koyame case reminds me of another case we covered a lot earlier,

24:33.980 --> 24:35.860
Jonathan Wagan.

24:35.860 --> 24:38.100
Let's remember the details of this testimony.

24:38.100 --> 24:44.220
What is confirmable here is the CIA's involvement in 1997's Operation Laser Strike in Peru

24:44.220 --> 24:46.820
to engage counter-narcotics.

24:46.820 --> 24:51.460
According to Wagan, the personnel he encountered after observing a crashed UAP in the jungles

24:51.460 --> 24:56.820
of Peru approached him from a nearby land at CH-47 twin rotor copter.

24:56.820 --> 25:02.800
The men's uniforms range from black fatigues, DOE rain jackets, and hazmat suits.

25:02.800 --> 25:07.780
In this video, I went into why NEST were likely candidates for the team Wagan encountered.

25:07.780 --> 25:13.260
A key relation to Koyame here is the presence of hazmat suits and the adverse mental effects

25:13.260 --> 25:19.660
Wagan claimed to have suffered such as intense and unexplainable fear when close to the craft.

25:19.660 --> 25:23.660
According to the report, this rapid reaction team was flown from their staging area in

25:23.660 --> 25:30.260
Fort Bliss, Texas to the crash site from four helicopters, guest by JS to be UH-1 Hueys and

25:30.260 --> 25:34.300
one larger helicopter like a CH-53 Super Stallion.

25:34.300 --> 25:39.740
The helicopters were flown in from an unknown location and assembled in a secure area.

25:39.740 --> 25:45.900
Crucial to note, JS states these craft were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.

25:45.900 --> 25:51.580
Signifying the vehicles may have been utilized specifically for clandestine operations.

25:51.580 --> 25:55.980
Fort Bliss may sound familiar to some, and in fact may be crucial to research moving

25:55.980 --> 25:56.980
forward.

25:56.980 --> 26:02.020
Fort Bliss is mentioned by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his book The Day After Roswell.

26:02.020 --> 26:07.180
According to Corso, debris and bodies from the 1947 Roswell crash were shipped to Fort

26:07.180 --> 26:08.580
Bliss, Texas.

26:08.580 --> 26:12.580
There aren't many other connections to Fort Bliss and UAP besides a handful of blue book

26:12.580 --> 26:16.340
sighting, but this really could be some interesting research going forward.

26:16.340 --> 26:21.060
And a quick side note, the team was allegedly given intelligence by the CIA gathered from

26:21.060 --> 26:26.180
satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight of the disk in plane collision.

26:26.180 --> 26:31.740
Intelligence via plane may have come from the El Paso Intelligence Center, known as Epic,

26:31.780 --> 26:38.780
established at Fort Bliss in 1974, possibly an EP-3E established in 1972, and the satellite

26:38.780 --> 26:43.820
imagery as discussed by Noah Torres likely came from the fleet of keyhole spy satellites

26:43.820 --> 26:46.820
put into orbit around 1971.

26:46.820 --> 26:50.180
These satellites were primarily operated by the NRO.

26:50.180 --> 26:55.700
Perhaps this is one instance of highly classified, high-res satellite imagery of crashed UAP

26:55.700 --> 26:57.540
David Grush has referred to.

26:57.540 --> 27:01.460
Curious to me here is how the Dinep report states once surveillance showed the Mexican

27:01.460 --> 27:06.700
convoy had stopped an aerial photography show two soldiers laying motionless on the ground,

27:06.700 --> 27:11.460
the recovery team's departure was delayed for the arrival of additional equipment, presumably

27:11.460 --> 27:15.380
hazard protection and explosives, and two additional personnel.

27:15.380 --> 27:19.780
Who were these additional personnel and were they possibly munitions experts sent to scrub

27:19.780 --> 27:21.820
contaminated crash sites?

27:21.820 --> 27:25.940
Upon securing the craft, the team loaded the vehicle onto a large truck and proceeded

27:25.940 --> 27:28.660
to original base for decontamination.

27:28.660 --> 27:33.540
But before leaving the site, the Dinep report states the Mexican vehicles, bodies, and civilian

27:33.540 --> 27:36.740
light plane were all destroyed with high explosives.

27:36.740 --> 27:41.220
This haste to destroy the site, delayed departure for additional crew, and refusal to bring

27:41.220 --> 27:45.540
Mexican bodies back for analysis, leads me to believe the American recovery team were

27:45.540 --> 27:50.780
possibly aware of the contamination that killed the soldiers beforehand and had highly trained

27:50.780 --> 27:53.820
explosive experts desanitize the site.

27:53.820 --> 27:59.780
Noah Torres wonders if the explosive used was an MK-54 SADM suitcase nuke.

27:59.780 --> 28:03.980
Carrying the smallest yield of 10 tons, such an explosive would effectively sterilize the

28:03.980 --> 28:09.060
site while keeping residual effects and damage to local population almost null.

28:09.060 --> 28:14.580
After all, in his 2000 paper Radiation Neutralization of Stored Biological Warfare Agents with Low

28:14.580 --> 28:19.500
Yield Nuclear Warheads, Hans Kruger argues fissile debris and fireballs can actually

28:19.500 --> 28:26.420
destroy biological agents.

28:26.420 --> 28:30.740
Initially when reading the Dinep report and still partly to today, I wonder if the US

28:30.740 --> 28:33.220
recovery team had killed the Mexican soldiers.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.220
J.S.

28:34.220 --> 28:38.460
and Dinep do not have the full picture here yet seem to have some understanding what happened

28:38.460 --> 28:42.700
to the men, quote, unfortunately what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is

28:42.700 --> 28:44.500
not known.

28:44.500 --> 28:48.300
Speculation ranges from a chemical release from the disc as a result of the damage to

28:48.300 --> 28:50.940
a microbiological agent, end quote.

28:50.940 --> 28:55.140
There still remains the possibility that the US team did in fact kill the soldiers in a

28:55.140 --> 29:00.020
hasty decision to prevent them from returning to base with UAP debris, and this does warrant

29:00.020 --> 29:01.620
further investigation.

29:01.620 --> 29:05.660
I can't help but to think back to David Grush, who mentioned numerous times crimes

29:05.660 --> 29:08.500
had been committed to maintain UAP secrecy.

29:08.500 --> 29:13.060
So if we adhere to Dinep, some contaminant from the down saucer led to the deaths of

29:13.060 --> 29:16.220
all soldiers on the Mexican recovery team.

29:16.220 --> 29:20.500
Possibly this was due to handling of bodies, reminding me of the police officer who allegedly

29:20.500 --> 29:25.460
died after touching a non-human intelligence bean in the Varginia Brazil case.

29:25.460 --> 29:30.260
But the report makes specific mention it is unaware if the disc was manned or not.

29:30.260 --> 29:34.540
Possibly the contaminant leaked from the quote, irregular hole approximately 12 inches in

29:34.540 --> 29:39.980
diameter with indented metal around it, end quote, observed on the crashed craft.

29:39.980 --> 29:44.780
Fantastic enough we do have some absolutely fascinating references here, nestled within

29:44.780 --> 29:51.100
the MJ-12 first annual report lies a passage within Section F, government policy of control

29:51.100 --> 29:52.600
and denial.

29:52.600 --> 29:58.060
Here the Majestic-12 panel cites their concern regarding several SED, Sandia National Labs

29:58.060 --> 30:02.620
personnel who came in contact with UFO debris and bodies.

30:02.620 --> 30:07.020
One technician collapsed while attempting removal of a body, one went into a coma for

30:07.020 --> 30:11.140
four hours when attempting to place an NHI body in a bag.

30:11.140 --> 30:15.520
All four technicians who suffered effects were rushed to Los Alamos but all four died

30:15.520 --> 30:18.140
of seizures and profuse bleeding.

30:18.140 --> 30:22.740
The report states upon inconclusive autopsies it appeared all four suffered from some form

30:22.740 --> 30:28.540
of toxin or highly contagious disease, extremely disturbing here as point 13 which states quote

30:28.540 --> 30:33.300
in the opinion of the senior atomic energy medical advisor, current medical equipment

30:33.300 --> 30:38.620
and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with a large scale outbreak of the alien virus

30:38.620 --> 30:39.820
end quote.

30:39.820 --> 30:40.820
But that's not all.

30:40.820 --> 30:45.580
I recently spoke about the US Army's brief interplanetary phenomenon unit denied to exist

30:45.580 --> 30:50.740
but proven through FOIA requests and only remembered by the Army through institutional memory.

30:50.740 --> 30:54.780
This unit was an Army in-house project and an interest item for an unnamed assistant

30:54.780 --> 30:56.220
chief of staff for intelligence.

30:56.220 --> 31:01.660
Well within Ryan S. Woods Majestic-12 files we can find an IPU summary report.

31:01.660 --> 31:05.740
This document discusses that all military and civilian personnel dealing with recovery

31:05.740 --> 31:09.900
operations operated on strictly need to know intelligence.

31:09.900 --> 31:14.620
Besides mention of the Kirtland crew performing functions very well, the report discusses

31:14.620 --> 31:18.780
severe nervous breakdowns and suicides by MPs.

31:18.780 --> 31:24.900
The report then goes on to state ground personnel from Sandia experienced some form of contamination

31:24.900 --> 31:28.220
resulting in the deaths of three technicians.

31:28.220 --> 31:32.700
So as far back as the 1940s according to the majestic documents technicians and other

31:32.700 --> 31:42.580
personnel have actually died from biological or toxic effects from craft and bodies.

31:42.580 --> 31:47.260
One of the most fascinating and possibly fruitful aspects of this investigations come from the

31:47.260 --> 31:50.580
open sourced encyclopedia site Wikipedia.

31:50.580 --> 31:56.060
Since 2008 Wikipedia featured a brief report on the Koyama UFO crash referencing the Dineb

31:56.060 --> 32:01.140
report, a UFO casebook article, link in the description, and one of our references Mexico's

32:01.140 --> 32:03.740
Roswell by Torres and Uriarte.

32:03.740 --> 32:08.220
The entry featured nothing new or noteworthy and that remained the case until September

32:08.220 --> 32:15.580
of 2012 when user Mercy 11 radically altered the article, adding names and intriguing details

32:15.580 --> 32:18.540
for the US recovery team and crash in general.

32:18.540 --> 32:23.380
Quote, at the US military radar airbase four Huey helicopters were readied up as well as

32:23.380 --> 32:27.220
a 15 man recovery team headed to Koyama, Mexico.

32:27.220 --> 32:32.300
The American group included Captain Lawrence Murley, Lieutenant Randall Bishop, Lieutenant

32:32.300 --> 32:38.060
Eduardo Ramirez, Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes, Sergeant Terrence Miles, and Lieutenant Jerome

32:38.060 --> 32:42.060
Smith, all retired US armed forces personnel.

32:42.060 --> 32:46.900
The group entered Mexico surreptitiously after intercepting a Mexican radio communication

32:46.900 --> 32:50.260
giving away the location of the crash site, end quote.

32:50.260 --> 32:56.020
Besides the names listed which we will explore shortly, Mercy 11 added two spectacular pieces

32:56.020 --> 32:57.420
of information.

32:57.420 --> 33:03.500
The recovery team included 15 members and all were retired US armed forces personnel.

33:03.500 --> 33:09.660
This suggests the recovery team was not involving active military, but some experienced, assembled,

33:09.660 --> 33:14.700
possibly private industry seasoned operators adjacent to US military and the intelligence

33:14.700 --> 33:15.740
community.

33:15.740 --> 33:18.180
But Mercy 11's additions don't stop here.

33:18.180 --> 33:23.300
The user seemingly adds names for all four deceased Mexican soldiers, quote, a short

33:23.300 --> 33:28.180
distance from the wreckage was also an olive green jeep belonging to the Mexican military

33:28.180 --> 33:32.020
and containing the bodies of four Mexican soldiers in it.

33:32.020 --> 33:39.340
The soldiers were Captain Rogelio Argueyes-Gonzalez, Sergeant Teofilo Margarito Puebla, Corporal

33:39.340 --> 33:45.300
Jose Trinidad Maraz, and Corporal Ricardo Velasquez, their bodies displayed signs of

33:45.300 --> 33:47.820
death by asphyxiation, end quote.

33:47.820 --> 33:51.780
And here is where the story gets strange, the author of Mexico's Roswell attempted

33:51.860 --> 33:56.420
to reach out to Mercy to discover where the user sourced this information, especially

33:56.420 --> 34:00.860
due to the fact existing citation for this section on a history and event cited the

34:00.860 --> 34:06.020
UFO casebook article mentioned above in a documentary titled UFO Hunters Unexplained

34:06.020 --> 34:11.860
Mexico's Roswell the Koyame Crash, neither of which featured any of this information.

34:11.860 --> 34:16.260
Yuriyate and Torres received a response from Mercy 11 in regards to where he found this

34:16.260 --> 34:21.540
information, but Mercy doubled down linking once again to this UFO Hunters episode.

34:21.540 --> 34:26.300
Upon following up, Mercy 11 stated, quote, I suspect what happened is that I saw the

34:26.300 --> 34:30.300
information at some other site, which I had on my screen at the moment, but in another

34:30.300 --> 34:34.660
window, which I failed to attribute and record properly, end quote.

34:34.660 --> 34:40.940
But again, does not link to this information which I nor any other researcher can find.

34:40.940 --> 34:45.780
Soon after these 2013 correspondences, we find the entire page for the incident deleted

34:45.780 --> 34:51.780
in 2014 by admin Scotty Wong, who shortly after retired his account.

34:51.780 --> 34:57.060
The entirety of this Wikipedia page's existence is incredibly suspicious, but let's try

34:57.060 --> 34:58.980
to analyze the data given.

34:58.980 --> 35:02.940
We are given a list of American names and to be honest, very little to work with.

35:02.940 --> 35:09.460
I can find almost nothing about Captain Slorence Murley, discovering only one Utah-based individual

35:09.460 --> 35:14.180
who left for the armed forces near the tail end of World War II, no rank or detail of

35:14.180 --> 35:15.760
service are given.

35:15.760 --> 35:19.680
Other data or lack thereof is available for Lieutenant Randall Bishop.

35:19.680 --> 35:24.400
We can find an Indiana man who lived from 1932 to 2020.

35:24.400 --> 35:28.340
Bishop was a Pershing Rifles member while attending the University of Kentucky.

35:28.340 --> 35:33.600
He left university to join the US Air Force where he served in the Korean War as a warzone

35:33.600 --> 35:35.360
air traffic controller.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.880
After his service, Bishop moved to Indiana to be a teacher, but let's take a second

35:38.880 --> 35:43.040
to remember the significance the infographics whistleblower put on the Korean War in the

35:43.040 --> 35:48.560
program, as well as the significance of this general area of Indiana.

35:48.560 --> 35:53.480
Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes has almost zero footprint outside of a famous US Civil War

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
soldier.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.760
The only somewhat modern day reference I can find to a Benjamin Rhodes exists within a

35:58.760 --> 36:02.160
1989 issue of American Legion.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.440
One Mr. Rhodes out of Della Field, Wisconsin served as a post commander for the Legion,

36:06.440 --> 36:10.440
however, it is unknown whether he was armed forces or not.

36:10.440 --> 36:16.400
We can find an active duty reference for 1 Terence Miles at the time of April 21, 1993

36:16.400 --> 36:21.480
in this edition of the Guantanamo Bay Gazette, Senior Chief Petty Officer Terence Miles as

36:21.480 --> 36:22.600
mentioned here.

36:22.600 --> 36:27.520
Of course, this breaks Mercy 11's claims that all operators were retired US armed forces,

36:27.520 --> 36:32.080
however, is it possible the sergeant re-enlisted thus furthering his rank?

36:32.080 --> 36:36.120
Zero records are available for 1 Jerome Smith, but if this was a misprint and we are looking

36:36.120 --> 36:39.280
at Lieutenant Jerome Smith, we can find a record.

36:39.280 --> 36:44.080
Deceased in 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Smith served in the US Army and was a World

36:44.080 --> 36:45.280
War II veteran.

36:45.280 --> 36:50.640
Smith transferred branches of service in 1970 to US Public Health Service, where he achieved

36:50.640 --> 36:54.000
the rank of commander before retiring in 1985.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.880
We can find a private first class at Water Ramirez who served in World War II and earned

36:58.880 --> 37:03.440
a distinguished service cross for bravery in destroying German machine gun nests with

37:03.440 --> 37:06.280
explosives and incendiaries.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.760
There is no record I can find of any promotion to Lieutenant.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.800
And it's key to note, some of these names could be legitimate, all could be legit, or

37:13.800 --> 37:16.040
all made up nonsense from Mercy 11.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.400
We just don't know at this time with all of our source references.

37:19.400 --> 37:24.860
But I am working with prestigious author Ryan S. Wood to really learn how to track down

37:24.860 --> 37:28.460
actual service records of previous soldiers who have served, so I may have some update

37:28.460 --> 37:29.620
on this in the future.

37:29.620 --> 37:33.600
There is only one real lead of the Mexico Soldier's demise, and this comes from Mexican

37:33.600 --> 37:36.440
UFO researcher Alfonso Salazar.

37:36.440 --> 37:41.040
I am unable to locate this article, but Salazar found a newspaper story from El Geraldo de

37:41.040 --> 37:47.960
Chihuahua, dated October 27, 1974, that detailed the death of a group of Mexican soldiers in

37:47.960 --> 37:56.720
the crash of a quote-unquote military transport.

37:56.720 --> 38:01.080
With Noah Torres and Ruben Uriartes' field work on this case, such as finding a piece

38:01.080 --> 38:05.800
of airplane debris near the supposed crash site, we do have some witness testimony to

38:05.800 --> 38:11.560
analyze regardless of this crash site being an estimated 60 miles from the nearest town.

38:11.560 --> 38:17.720
One such group of witnesses approached Torres in 2012 at a festival in Presidio, Texas.

38:17.720 --> 38:22.480
School teacher Johnny Chambers and her 10-year-old son at the time remembered seeing a strange

38:22.480 --> 38:28.320
fireball, a quote, big explosion in the sky, end quote, on the Mexican side of the border

38:28.320 --> 38:30.040
near the Coyamae incident.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.980
The two had thought a plane had crashed in the mountain.

38:32.980 --> 38:37.840
When interviewed by Torres, John Chambers stated, within a day of the fireball, several

38:37.840 --> 38:42.920
residents observed a group of military helicopters traveling back into the US from the Mexican

38:42.920 --> 38:46.240
side, including a large twin-rotor helicopter.

38:46.240 --> 38:51.040
And I do think it's important to state these witnesses did appear in 2012, five years after

38:51.040 --> 38:54.160
Torres and Uriartes' initial reporting on the case.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.200
These could be false witnesses, but we really have no way to prove.

38:57.200 --> 39:02.160
Period other witnesses have contacted Torres, such as Melissa P. from Facebook, full name

39:02.160 --> 39:07.280
withheld by Torres, who stated, quote, my uncle was ordered to go to the Mexico Roswell

39:07.280 --> 39:09.160
by the US military.

39:09.160 --> 39:12.200
He went, came back, and was never the same, end quote.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.960
But without names or further evidence, there really isn't much to explore here.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.240
And this is kind of the case for many of the witnesses Torres met along his field investigation

39:20.240 --> 39:22.120
of the Coyamae site.

39:22.120 --> 39:27.180
Many people told of strange fireballs, strange events that occurred around August of 1974,

39:27.180 --> 39:29.800
but we really don't have too much to work off of.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.340
In a frustrating recent event, we can look to Jesus Alberto, Mexican government official

39:34.340 --> 39:36.780
who sets up legislation and hearings.

39:36.780 --> 39:42.420
Alberto is currently tasked with UFO disclosure and is intimately tied to the Nazca mummies.

39:42.420 --> 39:48.340
On March 16th of 2024, Jay Alberto posted a now deleted tweet translated to, I have the

39:48.340 --> 39:50.180
vid at your time.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.940
It's a shit from another world.

39:51.940 --> 39:56.820
Some context around this tweet showed it to be referencing the 1974 Coyamae incident.

39:56.820 --> 40:02.100
I asked Jay Alberto if he was indeed referencing the Coyamae incident and if so would he share

40:02.100 --> 40:03.500
the video with me.

40:03.500 --> 40:08.140
The only response I got was a thumbs up about the video referencing the crash.

40:08.140 --> 40:12.820
In follow up messages, I inquired how I might get my hands on the video or if Alberto had

40:12.820 --> 40:17.780
any witnesses, military or civilian I could speak to, or any military documents on the

40:17.780 --> 40:20.180
case he might be able to share with me.

40:20.180 --> 40:23.060
All requests were met with no response.

40:23.060 --> 40:27.420
I'm hoping this video can put some pressure on him to indeed release whatever video he

40:27.420 --> 40:29.620
is referring to.

40:29.620 --> 40:34.260
What's up guys, thank you so much for watching and joining me as we did this deep dive into

40:34.260 --> 40:38.020
the 1974 Coyamae UFO crash.

40:38.020 --> 40:44.300
If you're anything like me, this story is fascinating and super perplexing with so many

40:44.300 --> 40:47.740
interesting details that lead into ufology at large.

40:47.740 --> 40:52.540
But at the same time, we're left with very little documentation and resources to investigate

40:52.540 --> 40:54.180
this further.

40:54.180 --> 40:59.180
Part of the purpose of this video was to lay out the facts as we know of this case.

40:59.180 --> 41:05.340
The Dineb report, the alterations to the Wikipedia page, the eyewitnesses, some aspects of the

41:05.340 --> 41:10.940
American recovery team in the CIA's involvement in other retrieval operations allegedly, according

41:10.940 --> 41:15.660
to Chris Sharpe, put that all out there and see where this investigation can go.

41:15.660 --> 41:20.940
I know when this video goes live I will be tweeting this video at Jesus Alberto, really

41:20.940 --> 41:24.620
putting some pressure and asking him to release this video.

41:24.620 --> 41:28.780
This case is so interesting whatever video this is, whether it's reconnaissance aircraft

41:28.780 --> 41:33.500
overflight or any internal Mexican government documents on this case.

41:33.500 --> 41:38.700
Any sort of video evidence, even if it is a truck convoy of Mexican soldiers entering

41:38.700 --> 41:43.860
up north from Coyamae around the same date, could prove paramount in adding to this case.

41:43.860 --> 41:47.820
I know I said it in the video, but I'm also trying to learn from Ryan S. Wood, who I met

41:47.820 --> 41:52.740
by the way, which was awesome, I'll tell you guys all about that more, but in how to

41:52.740 --> 41:57.500
access actual service records and personal archives to learn more about the names listed

41:57.500 --> 42:01.420
on the Wikipedia site and isn't that interesting those names added.

42:01.420 --> 42:04.620
You know I have scoured the internet, I've gone through every avenue I can trying to

42:04.620 --> 42:09.260
find any mention of those names, and when all these names were uploaded together and

42:09.260 --> 42:16.820
from what reference Mercy 11 was citing here, Ryan S. Wood is also in contact with Noah

42:16.820 --> 42:22.140
Torres and Ruben Uriarte, so I will be trying to talk to these authors to learn more and

42:22.140 --> 42:26.660
actually talk to them, hey did you guys follow up with Mercy, I know Mercy shut them down

42:26.660 --> 42:31.660
trying to actually get to know him and so forth, but you know let's see what they have

42:31.660 --> 42:37.020
uncovered because that document and their connection with Mercy occurred back in 2011,

42:37.020 --> 42:39.820
so who knows what they have uncovered since.

42:39.820 --> 42:43.500
What do you guys think of the case, are there any details I am missing, I still like to

42:43.500 --> 42:49.980
play with the fact the US recovery team actually killed the operators, the Mexican recovery

42:49.980 --> 42:50.980
team.

42:50.980 --> 42:55.460
I know that the Dineb report states that there was likely the chemical or biological agent

42:55.460 --> 43:00.340
that killed these guys and we also have the IPU and majestic documents too, kind of reference

43:00.340 --> 43:04.380
there and isn't that interesting the Sandia lab technicians, I know the MJ12 likes to

43:04.380 --> 43:08.900
reference Sandia at Kirtland Air Force Base quite a bit, as we saw in the Eisenhower

43:08.900 --> 43:15.700
briefing document in the 1950's slash 1955 El Indio slash Del Rio crash retrieval cases,

43:15.700 --> 43:23.380
which are pretty interesting, but you know the idea of being contaminated by craft and

43:23.380 --> 43:27.500
suffering ill effects is something I'd like to explore further.

43:27.500 --> 43:31.580
Remember in the whistleblower, the infographics whistleblower video, this whistleblower stated

43:31.580 --> 43:37.780
one of the first things that people do upon receiving a down craft is send in a team to

43:37.780 --> 43:42.740
analyze for any toxicity or any hazardous chemicals surrounding the craft, stands to

43:42.740 --> 43:46.860
reason this Mexican recovery team if they had never recovered a craft went in with soldiers

43:46.860 --> 43:52.540
with no additional protective gear and thus died from exposure, but what if the American

43:52.540 --> 43:56.900
recovery team did kill these soldiers, but let me know what you guys think about the

43:56.900 --> 44:01.660
involvement of the American recovery team and the case at large, I'm willing to bet

44:01.660 --> 44:05.660
a lot of you guys haven't really heard of this case or just kind of heard it in passing

44:05.660 --> 44:07.500
a little bit.

44:07.500 --> 44:11.500
I can't exactly remember the first time I ever heard of this case, but I think it was

44:11.500 --> 44:17.140
when the UAP caucus listed a list of a crash retrieval events to kind of pay attention to

44:17.140 --> 44:21.940
and to bring before Congress and I think either from there or from an offshoot of there I

44:21.940 --> 44:26.900
heard of this case and quickly afterwards I dove into it and found it so fascinating,

44:26.900 --> 44:33.420
especially just some of these details like a craft and a small passenger plane colliding.

44:33.420 --> 44:38.300
I know this story just requires a couple pieces of evidence to help verify further.

44:38.300 --> 44:40.060
That's why it's so frustrating.

44:40.060 --> 44:44.420
As well as diving into the origins of the Dineb report, Elaine Douglas, the researcher

44:44.420 --> 44:48.700
I spoke about who actually received the Dineb report, she passed away in 2014.

44:48.700 --> 44:49.700
She had a website.

44:49.700 --> 44:54.100
It was www.alaindouglas.com that actually had documents.

44:54.100 --> 44:57.000
I think it had a scan of the original Dineb report.

44:57.000 --> 45:04.040
When she passed, apparently her family was going to maintain her website, but no, the

45:04.040 --> 45:06.080
website is available in the web archive.

45:06.080 --> 45:10.200
I will link it in the video description, but if you try and go to the links to the Koyama

45:10.200 --> 45:11.880
instant, those are all missing.

45:11.880 --> 45:14.080
So that's very frustrating in itself.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.120
Ryan S. Wood also doesn't have the copies of the original document because it would

45:18.120 --> 45:22.720
be very great to put these kind of through a forensic test as Wood does with the MJ12

45:22.720 --> 45:23.720
documents.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.000
But anyway, guys, again, let me know what you think about the case.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.300
Do you have any other details I glossed over in this because I've really tried to scrounge

45:29.300 --> 45:32.760
as much as I can for any information on this case.

45:32.760 --> 45:36.960
Coming up, guys, a lot of interesting videos, a lot of crash retrievals I'm going to focus

45:36.960 --> 45:37.960
on, a lot of hidden programs.

45:37.960 --> 45:41.600
I'm going to do a video on the IPU now that I've met with Ryan S. Wood.

45:41.600 --> 45:47.880
We are going to do a video on the MJ12 documents, a very kind of comprehensive documentary and

45:47.880 --> 45:51.320
overview of the MJ12 using his expertise.

45:51.320 --> 45:55.600
I also want to make a video solely on the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual I spoke

45:55.680 --> 46:01.960
about in the last video, which Ryan Wood considers to be the most crucial piece of the MJ12 documents.

46:01.960 --> 46:05.400
Besides that, of course, crash retrievals, hopefully some good interviews coming up,

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
I hope so.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.400
We'll see about that.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.680
But thank you guys so much for watching.
