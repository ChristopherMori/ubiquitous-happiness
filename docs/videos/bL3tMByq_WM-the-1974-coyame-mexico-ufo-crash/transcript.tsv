0	3000	It didn't start or end with Roswell.
3000	7400	In fact, many countries around the world have stories of crashes of non-human intelligence
7400	12680	that rival the intrigue, cover-up, and credibility of the infamous crash that occurred in the
12680	15600	New Mexico Desert in 1947.
15600	20920	Whether this be Shag Harbor Canada, Maje Brazil, or others, tantalizing and perplexing stories
20920	24920	of UFO crashes are not isolated to the United States.
24920	31520	So today, let's investigate a severely underexplored UFO retrieval case that may give us the greatest
31520	36840	insights into U.S. craft recovery protocol that allegedly occurred in northern Mexico
36840	41440	in Coyame, Chihuahua, in the summer of 1974.
41440	45960	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so much for joining me today as we dive into a
45960	51760	gripping and underrepresented crash retrieval case commonly referred to by authors as Mexico's
51760	53040	Roswell.
53040	58840	This case features an astounding tale to rival any case of a downed UAP, a classic crash
58840	64560	disk, U.S. Special Forces recovery, a mysterious leaked report describing the event, the death
64560	69000	of the Mexican military retrieval force, and much, much more.
69000	73040	Is this case that has hardly seen any covering factor fiction?
73040	76160	Join me today as we try and find out.
76160	81120	And before we get started, it is worth noting primary sources for this case are few and
81120	82480	far between.
82480	86960	I will primarily be referencing the work of authors and first-hand investigators into
86960	93280	the Coyame case, Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte and their book, Mexico's Roswell, the Chihuahua
93280	99080	UFO Crash, and follow-up piece, The Coyome Incident, as well as Leonard Stringfield's
99080	105080	UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report 7 Part 9, and Ryan S. Wood's masterpiece, Magic Eyes
105080	109600	Only, which gives this case a medium to high level of authenticity.
113400	120840	In the early 1980s, whispers of a 1974 collision between a small private plane and disk-shaped
120840	125680	UFO occurring near Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico began circulating.
125680	130140	Tales of dead Mexican soldiers who initially recovered the craft in an American recovering
130140	135600	team who relieved the corpses of the craft wreckage began to rise and follow these whispers.
135600	141400	In 1994, legendary UFO crash retrieval researcher Leonard Stringfield would state, quote,
141520	147080	I heard of the Chihuahua case before, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s.
147080	152160	The only detail I vaguely recall is that the U.S. military team had covertly crossed into
152160	155000	Mexico to retrieve the object, end quote.
155000	161600	It wasn't until 1992 on an electronic bulletin board, an anomalous document titled, quote,
161600	166340	Research Finding on Chihuahua Disk Crash, end quote, would be posted, commonly referred
166340	170960	to as the Dineb Report, which we will discuss in much greater detail later.
170960	175600	This shadowy, possibly leaked or purposefully leaked memo of unknown origin details the
175600	180000	communications of one J.S. to all Dineb team members.
180000	185960	In early summer of 1993, paper copies of this document would be mailed anonymously to UFO
185960	190320	researchers such as Elaine Douglas, who shared the original documents with Stringfield.
190320	194840	This anonymous mailing to select researchers reminds me strongly of the origins of the
194840	196200	MJ-12 documents.
196200	199840	The Dineb Report serves as our primary document describing this case.
199840	204520	I find it crucial to read this document in its entirety as it serves as the greatest
204520	207200	analysis of this mysterious case.
207200	212080	Afterwards, we will investigate some of the key aspects of this report and event further,
212080	218400	so without further ado, let's dive right into this 1974 recovery story.
218400	226400	To all Dineb team members from J.S. date, 23rd March 1992, subject, Research Findings
226400	229640	on the Chihuahua Disk Crash, text.
229640	236920	In 25 Augs 74 at 2207 hours, U.S. air defense radar detected an unknown approaching U.S.
236920	239280	airspace from the Gulf of Mexico.
239280	246280	Originally, the object was tracked at 2200 knots on a bearing of 325 degrees and an altitude
246280	252360	of 75,000 feet, a course that would intercept U.S. territory about 40 miles southwest of
252360	254480	Corpus Christi, Texas.
254480	259640	After approximately 60 seconds of observation at a position of 155 miles southeast of Corpus
259640	265840	Christi, the object simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots, turning to a
265840	269440	heading of 290 degrees and began a slow descent.
269440	274960	It entered Mexican airspace approximately 40 miles southwest of Brownsville, Texas.
274960	279320	Radar attracted approximately 500 miles to a point near the town of Coyame in the state
279320	282160	of Chihuahua not far from the U.S. border.
282440	286320	There, the object suddenly disappeared from the radar screens.
286320	291400	During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at 45,000 feet, then descended
291400	292920	to 20,000 feet.
292920	298120	The descent was in level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level was
298120	301160	maintained for approximately 5 minutes.
301160	304820	The object was tracked by two different military radar installations.
304820	308720	It would have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it is assumed that no
308760	313320	civilian radar detected the object due to a lack of any such reports.
313320	317960	The point of disappearance from radar screens was over a barren and sparsely populated area
317960	319380	of northern Mexico.
319380	323560	At first, it was assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon, and
323560	326760	a watch was kept for any reemergence of the object.
326760	327920	None occurred.
327920	332000	At first, it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because of the high speed and
332000	336960	descending flight path, but meteors normally travel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth
337000	339200	arc, not in steps.
339200	343320	And meteors do not normally make a 35 degree change in course.
343320	346640	Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called.
346640	351160	However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, the object turned to a course
351160	354280	that would not immediately take it over US territory.
354280	357880	The alert was called off within 20 minutes after the object's disappearance from the
357880	358880	radar screen.
358880	364040	52 minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic indicated that a civilian craft
364160	366160	had gone down in that area.
366160	369880	But it was clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso International with a
369880	374200	destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have been tracked over the Gulf
374200	375540	of Mexico.
375540	381200	It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area at the same time.
381200	385680	Within daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for the missing plane.
385680	390120	Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radio report that records from the missing plane
390120	392640	had been spotted from the air.
392640	397800	Just immediately came a report of a second plane on the ground a few miles from the first.
397800	402360	After a few minutes, an additional report stated the second plane was circular shaped
402360	405320	and apparently in one piece, although damaged.
405320	410880	A few minutes after that, the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts.
410880	415880	The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two
415880	419440	additional government agencies also received reports.
419440	422280	But such has not been confirmed as of this date.
422320	425840	The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.
425840	429840	The speed with which this team and equipment was assembled suggests that this was either
429840	435160	a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event.
435160	440000	In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States
440000	444360	and Mexican government that the U.S. recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to
444360	446680	quote-unquote assist.
446680	451800	These reports were met with professional ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation.
451800	459320	By 2100 hours, 26 AUG 74, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort Bliss.
459320	464720	Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured area.
464720	469360	These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.
469360	474720	Eyewitness indicates that there are three smaller craft, very probably UH-1 Hueys from
474720	476160	the description.
476160	480200	There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a sea stallion.
480200	485400	All from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Fort Bliss personnel.
485400	490440	Satellite and Recognizant's aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crash disc
490440	496400	and civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded onto flatbed trucks.
496400	501240	Later flights confirmed the convoy had departed the area heading south.
501240	506360	At that point, the CIA had to make a choice, either to allow this unknown aircraft to stay
506360	511360	in the hands of the Mexican government or to launch the recovery team, supplemented by
511360	515040	any required military support to take the craft.
515040	519040	There occurred, however, an event that took the choice out of their hands.
519040	523840	High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited
523840	526160	areas or major roads.
526160	531200	Recogn showed no activity and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters
531200	532600	had ceased.
532600	535840	At low altitude, high-speed overflight was ordered.
535840	540720	The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with doors
540720	545680	open and two human bodies laying on the ground beside the two vehicles.
545680	550040	The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team, but the actual launching
550040	554960	was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel.
554960	560000	It was not until 1438 hours that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss.
560000	564760	The four helicopters followed the border down to Bercito, then turned and entered Mexican
564760	567360	airspace north of Candelaria.
567360	571160	They were over the convoy site at 1653 hours.
571160	575400	All convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks.
575400	580280	Some recovery team members dressed in bioprotection suits reconfigured the straps holding the
580280	586460	object onto the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the sea stallion.
586460	591820	By 1714 hours, the recovered object was on its way to US territory.
591820	596080	Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery team gathered together the Mexican
596080	601700	vehicle and bodies, then destroyed all with high explosives.
601700	605780	This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air
605780	606980	collision.
606980	610380	At 1746 hours, the Hueys departed.
610380	614620	The Hueys caught up with the sea stallion as it re-entered US airspace.
614620	619980	The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately 25 miles
619980	621660	northeast of Valentine.
621660	626580	There, they landed and waited until 0-2-5 hours the next morning.
626580	631260	At that time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with the small convoy on the road
631260	633740	besides Van Horn and Kent.
633740	638420	The recovered disc was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being
638420	640420	sealed totally.
640420	643940	Some of the personnel from the Hueys transferred to the convoy.
643940	649100	All helicopters then returned to their original basis for decontamination procedures.
649100	654220	The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways and staying away
654220	655660	from cities.
655660	660700	The destination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia.
660700	662820	Here the hard evidence thins out.
662820	668780	One unconfirmed report says the disc was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
668780	673180	Another says that the disc was either transferred after that to another unnamed base or was
673180	677100	taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta.
677100	682860	The best description of this disc was that it was 16 feet 5 inches in diameter, convex
682860	689540	on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows.
689540	692380	The thickness was slightly less than 5 feet.
692380	695660	The color was silver, much like polished steel.
695660	700220	There were no visible lights nor any propulsion means, there were no markings.
700220	703340	There were two areas of the rim that showed damage.
703340	708420	One showing in a regular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal around
708420	709420	it.
709420	714260	The other damage was described as a quote-unquote dent, about 2 feet wide.
714260	720180	The weight of the object was estimated as approximately 1,500 pounds, based on the effect
720180	724460	of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck.
724460	728980	There was no indication in the document available as to whether anything else was visible in
728980	731100	the quote-unquote hole.
731100	734860	It seemed likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the
734860	736660	civilian craft.
736660	744060	That collision occurred while the object was traveling at approximately 1,955 miles per
744060	745300	hour.
745300	749500	Even ignoring the speed of the civilian craft, the impact would have been considerable at
749500	750860	that speed.
750860	755220	This is an agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being quote, almost
755220	757860	totally destroyed end quote.
757860	761900	What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of the civilian craft.
761900	766060	The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with the ground.
766060	770580	The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact.
770580	774300	No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian craft.
774300	778260	It is not known if any body or bodies were discovered.
778260	782420	Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies may well
782420	785740	have not come down near the larger pieces.
785740	791020	Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known.
791020	795780	Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disc as a result of the damage to
795780	798220	a microbiological agent.
798220	802700	There are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team.
802700	806700	It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back
806700	810660	with them for analysis, but there is no indication of that happening.
810660	814980	Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what may have been a biologically
814980	816900	contaminated body.
816900	822940	Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because
822940	827900	it does not involve a U.S. aircraft, nor did it occur over U.S. airspace.
827900	831660	It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story.
831660	835360	Nothing is known of the analysis of the craft nor its contents.
835360	839820	Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign recovery team, nor is it
839820	843060	known if this craft was manned or not.
843060	848180	Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disc be taken to Atlanta, and where
848180	849780	did the disc come from?
849780	855180	It was first detected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U.S. air defenses
855180	858060	extend to a much greater distance than that.
858060	862940	If the object descended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD's space tracking has some record
862940	864460	of the object.
864460	869340	Alternate possibility is that it entered the Gulf of Mexico under radar limits, then, quote
869340	873540	unquote, jumped up to 75,000 feet.
873540	878340	Considering prior behavior exhibited by discs of this size, it is probable that the entry
878340	880660	was from orbital altitude.
880660	885380	The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness accounts.
885380	889220	Documentation illegally copied and a partially destroyed document.
889220	893380	This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.
893380	899260	Only in February of this year did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group.
899260	906180	End of document.
906180	911300	Very little, and I mean very little, is known about the origins of this mysterious-to-never
911300	912300	report.
912300	917680	As mentioned above, the document first appeared on early message boards in 1992, before being
917680	922340	anonymously mailed to researchers such as Elaine Douglas and Nick Redfern.
922340	927100	Immediately, copies made their way into the hands of Leonard Stringfield in his sublime
927100	933060	crash retrieval status report stating, quote, reviewing the text of the report initial JS
933060	938580	which follows, I find that it is authoritatively written, using correct military terminology
938580	945220	and of note and unlike a hoax, draws the line between so-called hard evidence and that which
945220	946980	is speculative, end quote.
946980	951500	What is crucial to remember here is Stringfield had heard rumors of this case around a decade
951500	956660	prior, and let's note in Stringfield's own words, when presenting his initial retrievals
956740	963340	of the third kind at Mufon in 1978, he was, quote, unquote, informed circuitously by the
963340	965940	CIA several days in advance.
965940	972300	It would be inadvisable for him to discuss crash information in Mexico or West Germany.
972300	976940	So the author of this piece, JS, seems to have intimate knowledge gathered by primary
976940	981620	sources about the incident and desired the release of evidence to interested parties,
981620	983620	i.e. the Deneb team.
983620	986300	Is JS an acronym or a name?
986340	991380	While Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte hypothesize JS is an acronym for a department within the
991380	996780	US government, such as joint staff or joint services, perhaps the Deneb team was a name
996780	1001940	for an internal USG investigation group during the, quote, unquote, dark ages of UAP, as
1001940	1003540	I like to call them.
1003540	1008740	We know there is a massive gap of any official UAP programs within USG, from the ending of
1008740	1015140	Blue Book in 1969 to the creation of ASAP slash ATIP in 2007, and from the words of
1015180	1021420	Lu Elizondo, we do know unknown UAP programs were operating in the 1980s.
1021420	1026340	Or with recent revelations of the UAP task force utilizing top secret online forums
1026340	1032340	to discuss UAP, maybe the Deneb team was a similar group of intelligence community professionals
1032340	1037260	who used the early internet message boards to discuss obfuscated data on crash retrieval
1037260	1038500	cases.
1038500	1044340	What is also interesting to note is the, quote, file UFO 3263, and, quote, indicating the
1044340	1048860	Koyame report is one of many studied by Deneb and JS.
1048860	1053780	Whether JS is an individual or group with intimate knowledge into the Koyome incident,
1053780	1059380	it seems the author does not have a direct line of information from the named CIA, NORAD,
1059380	1063660	or other agencies we kind of guess, such as the NRO or NGA.
1063660	1069660	The facts were, quote, gathered from two eyewitness accounts, documentation illegally copied and
1069660	1071820	a partially destroyed document.
1071820	1075500	This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.
1075500	1080740	Only in February of this year, 1992, did the notes and documents come into the hands of
1080740	1082340	our group, end quote.
1082340	1088140	JS even states multiple times, he or they are unaware of the analysis of the craft,
1088140	1093420	the craft's ultimate destination, and other details such as the inclusion of bodies.
1093420	1098620	Deneb itself is a highly luminous blue star originated in the constellation Cygnus, one
1098620	1102740	of the eldest constellations recognized by early civilizations.
1102740	1108860	The star is a supergiant with luminosity equal to 60,000 souls or Earth's suns.
1108860	1113380	The Milky Way's Great Rift, a critical junction in the galaxy where the Milky Way splits into
1113380	1117340	two long sides, begins near Deneb into Cygnus.
1117340	1122980	This particular area held special significance to ancient stargazers, and of particular note,
1122980	1132980	southern Mexico shamans who referred to the rift as Zibalba B, the birth of all life.
1132980	1138740	The Deneb report describes an extremely unlikely chance of a collision between a UFO with a
1138740	1143500	civilian light plane, which is one of the most key aspects to this case.
1143500	1147820	According to the report, civilian air traffic had indicated the crash of a civilian aircraft
1147820	1151620	along the route of El Paso, Texas to Mexico City.
1151620	1156780	The Deneb team made inquiries into the FAA to identify the airport, but received no documents
1156780	1159580	concluding the plane was of Mexican origin.
1159580	1165060	And unfortunately, examining U.S. 1974 aircraft crashes such as aircraft accident reports
1165060	1169180	from Embry Riddle University yields no results either.
1169180	1173580	Aviation Safety Network additionally lists no crashes in the year of 1974 occurring in
1173580	1175100	Mexico.
1175100	1179500	Many researchers such as Torres and Uriarte believe the craft would have been a Cessna
1179500	1181740	180 light aircraft.
1181740	1186540	This is due to the last detection of the UFO by U.S. air defense radar at 20,000 feet
1186540	1187540	or under.
1187540	1193500	Since this aircraft has a service ceiling of 17,700 feet, the authors of Mexico's Roswell
1193500	1199500	guessed the craft to be a perfect fit for a covert, low altitude, and slow speed craft.
1199500	1204540	So if this case is real, that likely leaves us with a craft performing illegal operations
1204540	1208620	in a Cessna 180 such as drug smuggling operations.
1208620	1214940	In 1974, anti-drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico was an extremely pertinent issue.
1214940	1219700	Let's reference this discussion between U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Mexican President
1219700	1225660	that occurred on October 21, 1974, just two months after our crash story.
1225660	1231020	The Mexican President states, quote, along the 3,000 kilometer border, it is very easy
1231020	1235660	for small planes to take off and land in small private ranches.
1236060	1240380	According to Torres and Uriartes' follow-up book to Mexico's Roswell the Coyame Incident,
1240380	1245780	the two mentioned the August 1974 death of a 50-year-old Mexican pilot Enrique Riviera
1245780	1250860	Gutierrez as reported in El Fronterizo of Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua.
1250860	1254900	I've personally been unable to track this paper, but the authors discussed that the
1254900	1260780	man died on August 30, 1974 from horrific injuries sustained in a plane crash on an
1260780	1263220	unknown date prior to the article.
1263220	1266860	The authors argue this could possibly be the pilot mentioned in the Dineb report, but
1266860	1272780	I find that highly unlikely, due to the collision of a UFO and private plane at thousands of
1272780	1274180	feet altitude.
1274180	1278740	Beside some alleged aircraft parts discovered in the crash region by Torres and Uriartes,
1278740	1282980	we really have nothing to work with here in terms of tracking down this plane.
1287980	1292820	The Dineb reports makes numerous mention to the CIA, quote, the radio interceptions
1292820	1297780	were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two additional government
1297780	1302940	agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date.
1302940	1306140	The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.
1306140	1310060	The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that it was either
1310060	1315300	a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event, end quote.
1315300	1319380	I am once again drawn to this article by the incredible Christopher Sharpe, which accuses
1319460	1324500	the CIA's Office of Global Access of playing a central role in UFO crash retrieval since
1324500	1326100	2003.
1326100	1331780	The article states the OGA coordinates with Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, amongst
1331780	1333580	others to collect craft.
1333580	1338340	The implication of the CIA and the Dineb report leads us to suspect departments within the
1338340	1344060	CIA have engaged in crash retrievals far before the OGA's creation in 2003.
1344060	1351620	And unfortunately, we can find CIA FOIA requests such as F-2007-00637 alleged mid-air collisions
1351620	1357940	near Coyame, Mexico on 825 or 26 1974 with no results.
1357940	1361580	However, we still do have some really interesting clues to pursue.
1361580	1365980	The role of the OGA in UFO crash retrievals as described by Sharpe's anonymous source
1365980	1369780	closely resembles the role of the CIA in the Dineb report.
1369780	1374460	According to Sharpe's source, quote, they are basically a facilitator for people to get
1374460	1376580	in and out of countries.
1376580	1381300	They are very clever at being able to get anywhere in the world they want to, end quote.
1381300	1385860	And an additional source of Sharpe stated, quote, the task at hand is simply to get into
1385860	1389020	the custody and protect the secrecy of it.
1389020	1393740	The actual physical retrieval is done by the military, but it's not kept under military
1393740	1398740	control because they have to keep too many records, so they start moving it out fairly
1398740	1401380	quickly into private hands, end quote.
1401380	1406140	In the Dineb report, the CIA gathered intelligence on the UFO and assembled a recovery team who
1406140	1410780	we will later learn may have all been retired U.S. armed forces.
1410780	1416620	The UFO was then taken covertly by an unknown convoy to Atlanta, Georgia where, by the way,
1416620	1422140	we can find a Lockheed Martin complex located in Air Force Plant 6, less than 30 miles outside
1422140	1423140	of Atlanta.
1423140	1428220	In Lockheed's own words, this location offers, quote, skunkworks work in advanced development,
1428220	1429220	end quote.
1429220	1433940	And while Lockheed Martin was founded in 1995, we can clearly see one of its precursors,
1433940	1439860	the Lockheed Company, engaged in C-130 work in Marietta, Georgia since the 1950s.
1439860	1444300	And what's even stranger here is the existence of the Lockheed Martin Georgia Nuclear Aircraft
1444300	1450340	Laboratory known as AFP number 67, which served as Lockheed's lab for investigating the feasibility
1450340	1452180	of nuclear aircraft.
1452180	1457260	The site was closed in 1971 and acquired by the city of Atlanta, but this is still a very
1457260	1458900	interesting connection.
1458900	1464220	Two sources in the Daily Mail told Sharp, alongside JSOC, nuclear weapons experts such
1464220	1469020	as the Nuclear Emergency Support Team or NEST perform retrieval operations.
1469020	1473980	With this in mind, the Koyame case reminds me of another case we covered a lot earlier,
1473980	1475860	Jonathan Wagan.
1475860	1478100	Let's remember the details of this testimony.
1478100	1484220	What is confirmable here is the CIA's involvement in 1997's Operation Laser Strike in Peru
1484220	1486820	to engage counter-narcotics.
1486820	1491460	According to Wagan, the personnel he encountered after observing a crashed UAP in the jungles
1491460	1496820	of Peru approached him from a nearby land at CH-47 twin rotor copter.
1496820	1502800	The men's uniforms range from black fatigues, DOE rain jackets, and hazmat suits.
1502800	1507780	In this video, I went into why NEST were likely candidates for the team Wagan encountered.
1507780	1513260	A key relation to Koyame here is the presence of hazmat suits and the adverse mental effects
1513260	1519660	Wagan claimed to have suffered such as intense and unexplainable fear when close to the craft.
1519660	1523660	According to the report, this rapid reaction team was flown from their staging area in
1523660	1530260	Fort Bliss, Texas to the crash site from four helicopters, guest by JS to be UH-1 Hueys and
1530260	1534300	one larger helicopter like a CH-53 Super Stallion.
1534300	1539740	The helicopters were flown in from an unknown location and assembled in a secure area.
1539740	1545900	Crucial to note, JS states these craft were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.
1545900	1551580	Signifying the vehicles may have been utilized specifically for clandestine operations.
1551580	1555980	Fort Bliss may sound familiar to some, and in fact may be crucial to research moving
1555980	1556980	forward.
1556980	1562020	Fort Bliss is mentioned by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his book The Day After Roswell.
1562020	1567180	According to Corso, debris and bodies from the 1947 Roswell crash were shipped to Fort
1567180	1568580	Bliss, Texas.
1568580	1572580	There aren't many other connections to Fort Bliss and UAP besides a handful of blue book
1572580	1576340	sighting, but this really could be some interesting research going forward.
1576340	1581060	And a quick side note, the team was allegedly given intelligence by the CIA gathered from
1581060	1586180	satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight of the disk in plane collision.
1586180	1591740	Intelligence via plane may have come from the El Paso Intelligence Center, known as Epic,
1591780	1598780	established at Fort Bliss in 1974, possibly an EP-3E established in 1972, and the satellite
1598780	1603820	imagery as discussed by Noah Torres likely came from the fleet of keyhole spy satellites
1603820	1606820	put into orbit around 1971.
1606820	1610180	These satellites were primarily operated by the NRO.
1610180	1615700	Perhaps this is one instance of highly classified, high-res satellite imagery of crashed UAP
1615700	1617540	David Grush has referred to.
1617540	1621460	Curious to me here is how the Dinep report states once surveillance showed the Mexican
1621460	1626700	convoy had stopped an aerial photography show two soldiers laying motionless on the ground,
1626700	1631460	the recovery team's departure was delayed for the arrival of additional equipment, presumably
1631460	1635380	hazard protection and explosives, and two additional personnel.
1635380	1639780	Who were these additional personnel and were they possibly munitions experts sent to scrub
1639780	1641820	contaminated crash sites?
1641820	1645940	Upon securing the craft, the team loaded the vehicle onto a large truck and proceeded
1645940	1648660	to original base for decontamination.
1648660	1653540	But before leaving the site, the Dinep report states the Mexican vehicles, bodies, and civilian
1653540	1656740	light plane were all destroyed with high explosives.
1656740	1661220	This haste to destroy the site, delayed departure for additional crew, and refusal to bring
1661220	1665540	Mexican bodies back for analysis, leads me to believe the American recovery team were
1665540	1670780	possibly aware of the contamination that killed the soldiers beforehand and had highly trained
1670780	1673820	explosive experts desanitize the site.
1673820	1679780	Noah Torres wonders if the explosive used was an MK-54 SADM suitcase nuke.
1679780	1683980	Carrying the smallest yield of 10 tons, such an explosive would effectively sterilize the
1683980	1689060	site while keeping residual effects and damage to local population almost null.
1689060	1694580	After all, in his 2000 paper Radiation Neutralization of Stored Biological Warfare Agents with Low
1694580	1699500	Yield Nuclear Warheads, Hans Kruger argues fissile debris and fireballs can actually
1699500	1706420	destroy biological agents.
1706420	1710740	Initially when reading the Dinep report and still partly to today, I wonder if the US
1710740	1713220	recovery team had killed the Mexican soldiers.
1713220	1714220	J.S.
1714220	1718460	and Dinep do not have the full picture here yet seem to have some understanding what happened
1718460	1722700	to the men, quote, unfortunately what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is
1722700	1724500	not known.
1724500	1728300	Speculation ranges from a chemical release from the disc as a result of the damage to
1728300	1730940	a microbiological agent, end quote.
1730940	1735140	There still remains the possibility that the US team did in fact kill the soldiers in a
1735140	1740020	hasty decision to prevent them from returning to base with UAP debris, and this does warrant
1740020	1741620	further investigation.
1741620	1745660	I can't help but to think back to David Grush, who mentioned numerous times crimes
1745660	1748500	had been committed to maintain UAP secrecy.
1748500	1753060	So if we adhere to Dinep, some contaminant from the down saucer led to the deaths of
1753060	1756220	all soldiers on the Mexican recovery team.
1756220	1760500	Possibly this was due to handling of bodies, reminding me of the police officer who allegedly
1760500	1765460	died after touching a non-human intelligence bean in the Varginia Brazil case.
1765460	1770260	But the report makes specific mention it is unaware if the disc was manned or not.
1770260	1774540	Possibly the contaminant leaked from the quote, irregular hole approximately 12 inches in
1774540	1779980	diameter with indented metal around it, end quote, observed on the crashed craft.
1779980	1784780	Fantastic enough we do have some absolutely fascinating references here, nestled within
1784780	1791100	the MJ-12 first annual report lies a passage within Section F, government policy of control
1791100	1792600	and denial.
1792600	1798060	Here the Majestic-12 panel cites their concern regarding several SED, Sandia National Labs
1798060	1802620	personnel who came in contact with UFO debris and bodies.
1802620	1807020	One technician collapsed while attempting removal of a body, one went into a coma for
1807020	1811140	four hours when attempting to place an NHI body in a bag.
1811140	1815520	All four technicians who suffered effects were rushed to Los Alamos but all four died
1815520	1818140	of seizures and profuse bleeding.
1818140	1822740	The report states upon inconclusive autopsies it appeared all four suffered from some form
1822740	1828540	of toxin or highly contagious disease, extremely disturbing here as point 13 which states quote
1828540	1833300	in the opinion of the senior atomic energy medical advisor, current medical equipment
1833300	1838620	and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with a large scale outbreak of the alien virus
1838620	1839820	end quote.
1839820	1840820	But that's not all.
1840820	1845580	I recently spoke about the US Army's brief interplanetary phenomenon unit denied to exist
1845580	1850740	but proven through FOIA requests and only remembered by the Army through institutional memory.
1850740	1854780	This unit was an Army in-house project and an interest item for an unnamed assistant
1854780	1856220	chief of staff for intelligence.
1856220	1861660	Well within Ryan S. Woods Majestic-12 files we can find an IPU summary report.
1861660	1865740	This document discusses that all military and civilian personnel dealing with recovery
1865740	1869900	operations operated on strictly need to know intelligence.
1869900	1874620	Besides mention of the Kirtland crew performing functions very well, the report discusses
1874620	1878780	severe nervous breakdowns and suicides by MPs.
1878780	1884900	The report then goes on to state ground personnel from Sandia experienced some form of contamination
1884900	1888220	resulting in the deaths of three technicians.
1888220	1892700	So as far back as the 1940s according to the majestic documents technicians and other
1892700	1902580	personnel have actually died from biological or toxic effects from craft and bodies.
1902580	1907260	One of the most fascinating and possibly fruitful aspects of this investigations come from the
1907260	1910580	open sourced encyclopedia site Wikipedia.
1910580	1916060	Since 2008 Wikipedia featured a brief report on the Koyama UFO crash referencing the Dineb
1916060	1921140	report, a UFO casebook article, link in the description, and one of our references Mexico's
1921140	1923740	Roswell by Torres and Uriarte.
1923740	1928220	The entry featured nothing new or noteworthy and that remained the case until September
1928220	1935580	of 2012 when user Mercy 11 radically altered the article, adding names and intriguing details
1935580	1938540	for the US recovery team and crash in general.
1938540	1943380	Quote, at the US military radar airbase four Huey helicopters were readied up as well as
1943380	1947220	a 15 man recovery team headed to Koyama, Mexico.
1947220	1952300	The American group included Captain Lawrence Murley, Lieutenant Randall Bishop, Lieutenant
1952300	1958060	Eduardo Ramirez, Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes, Sergeant Terrence Miles, and Lieutenant Jerome
1958060	1962060	Smith, all retired US armed forces personnel.
1962060	1966900	The group entered Mexico surreptitiously after intercepting a Mexican radio communication
1966900	1970260	giving away the location of the crash site, end quote.
1970260	1976020	Besides the names listed which we will explore shortly, Mercy 11 added two spectacular pieces
1976020	1977420	of information.
1977420	1983500	The recovery team included 15 members and all were retired US armed forces personnel.
1983500	1989660	This suggests the recovery team was not involving active military, but some experienced, assembled,
1989660	1994700	possibly private industry seasoned operators adjacent to US military and the intelligence
1994700	1995740	community.
1995740	1998180	But Mercy 11's additions don't stop here.
1998180	2003300	The user seemingly adds names for all four deceased Mexican soldiers, quote, a short
2003300	2008180	distance from the wreckage was also an olive green jeep belonging to the Mexican military
2008180	2012020	and containing the bodies of four Mexican soldiers in it.
2012020	2019340	The soldiers were Captain Rogelio Argueyes-Gonzalez, Sergeant Teofilo Margarito Puebla, Corporal
2019340	2025300	Jose Trinidad Maraz, and Corporal Ricardo Velasquez, their bodies displayed signs of
2025300	2027820	death by asphyxiation, end quote.
2027820	2031780	And here is where the story gets strange, the author of Mexico's Roswell attempted
2031860	2036420	to reach out to Mercy to discover where the user sourced this information, especially
2036420	2040860	due to the fact existing citation for this section on a history and event cited the
2040860	2046020	UFO casebook article mentioned above in a documentary titled UFO Hunters Unexplained
2046020	2051860	Mexico's Roswell the Koyame Crash, neither of which featured any of this information.
2051860	2056260	Yuriyate and Torres received a response from Mercy 11 in regards to where he found this
2056260	2061540	information, but Mercy doubled down linking once again to this UFO Hunters episode.
2061540	2066300	Upon following up, Mercy 11 stated, quote, I suspect what happened is that I saw the
2066300	2070300	information at some other site, which I had on my screen at the moment, but in another
2070300	2074660	window, which I failed to attribute and record properly, end quote.
2074660	2080940	But again, does not link to this information which I nor any other researcher can find.
2080940	2085780	Soon after these 2013 correspondences, we find the entire page for the incident deleted
2085780	2091780	in 2014 by admin Scotty Wong, who shortly after retired his account.
2091780	2097060	The entirety of this Wikipedia page's existence is incredibly suspicious, but let's try
2097060	2098980	to analyze the data given.
2098980	2102940	We are given a list of American names and to be honest, very little to work with.
2102940	2109460	I can find almost nothing about Captain Slorence Murley, discovering only one Utah-based individual
2109460	2114180	who left for the armed forces near the tail end of World War II, no rank or detail of
2114180	2115760	service are given.
2115760	2119680	Other data or lack thereof is available for Lieutenant Randall Bishop.
2119680	2124400	We can find an Indiana man who lived from 1932 to 2020.
2124400	2128340	Bishop was a Pershing Rifles member while attending the University of Kentucky.
2128340	2133600	He left university to join the US Air Force where he served in the Korean War as a warzone
2133600	2135360	air traffic controller.
2135360	2138880	After his service, Bishop moved to Indiana to be a teacher, but let's take a second
2138880	2143040	to remember the significance the infographics whistleblower put on the Korean War in the
2143040	2148560	program, as well as the significance of this general area of Indiana.
2148560	2153480	Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes has almost zero footprint outside of a famous US Civil War
2153480	2154480	soldier.
2154480	2158760	The only somewhat modern day reference I can find to a Benjamin Rhodes exists within a
2158760	2162160	1989 issue of American Legion.
2162160	2166440	One Mr. Rhodes out of Della Field, Wisconsin served as a post commander for the Legion,
2166440	2170440	however, it is unknown whether he was armed forces or not.
2170440	2176400	We can find an active duty reference for 1 Terence Miles at the time of April 21, 1993
2176400	2181480	in this edition of the Guantanamo Bay Gazette, Senior Chief Petty Officer Terence Miles as
2181480	2182600	mentioned here.
2182600	2187520	Of course, this breaks Mercy 11's claims that all operators were retired US armed forces,
2187520	2192080	however, is it possible the sergeant re-enlisted thus furthering his rank?
2192080	2196120	Zero records are available for 1 Jerome Smith, but if this was a misprint and we are looking
2196120	2199280	at Lieutenant Jerome Smith, we can find a record.
2199280	2204080	Deceased in 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Smith served in the US Army and was a World
2204080	2205280	War II veteran.
2205280	2210640	Smith transferred branches of service in 1970 to US Public Health Service, where he achieved
2210640	2214000	the rank of commander before retiring in 1985.
2214000	2218880	We can find a private first class at Water Ramirez who served in World War II and earned
2218880	2223440	a distinguished service cross for bravery in destroying German machine gun nests with
2223440	2226280	explosives and incendiaries.
2226280	2229760	There is no record I can find of any promotion to Lieutenant.
2229760	2233800	And it's key to note, some of these names could be legitimate, all could be legit, or
2233800	2236040	all made up nonsense from Mercy 11.
2236040	2239400	We just don't know at this time with all of our source references.
2239400	2244860	But I am working with prestigious author Ryan S. Wood to really learn how to track down
2244860	2248460	actual service records of previous soldiers who have served, so I may have some update
2248460	2249620	on this in the future.
2249620	2253600	There is only one real lead of the Mexico Soldier's demise, and this comes from Mexican
2253600	2256440	UFO researcher Alfonso Salazar.
2256440	2261040	I am unable to locate this article, but Salazar found a newspaper story from El Geraldo de
2261040	2267960	Chihuahua, dated October 27, 1974, that detailed the death of a group of Mexican soldiers in
2267960	2276720	the crash of a quote-unquote military transport.
2276720	2281080	With Noah Torres and Ruben Uriartes' field work on this case, such as finding a piece
2281080	2285800	of airplane debris near the supposed crash site, we do have some witness testimony to
2285800	2291560	analyze regardless of this crash site being an estimated 60 miles from the nearest town.
2291560	2297720	One such group of witnesses approached Torres in 2012 at a festival in Presidio, Texas.
2297720	2302480	School teacher Johnny Chambers and her 10-year-old son at the time remembered seeing a strange
2302480	2308320	fireball, a quote, big explosion in the sky, end quote, on the Mexican side of the border
2308320	2310040	near the Coyamae incident.
2310040	2312980	The two had thought a plane had crashed in the mountain.
2312980	2317840	When interviewed by Torres, John Chambers stated, within a day of the fireball, several
2317840	2322920	residents observed a group of military helicopters traveling back into the US from the Mexican
2322920	2326240	side, including a large twin-rotor helicopter.
2326240	2331040	And I do think it's important to state these witnesses did appear in 2012, five years after
2331040	2334160	Torres and Uriartes' initial reporting on the case.
2334160	2337200	These could be false witnesses, but we really have no way to prove.
2337200	2342160	Period other witnesses have contacted Torres, such as Melissa P. from Facebook, full name
2342160	2347280	withheld by Torres, who stated, quote, my uncle was ordered to go to the Mexico Roswell
2347280	2349160	by the US military.
2349160	2352200	He went, came back, and was never the same, end quote.
2352200	2355960	But without names or further evidence, there really isn't much to explore here.
2355960	2360240	And this is kind of the case for many of the witnesses Torres met along his field investigation
2360240	2362120	of the Coyamae site.
2362120	2367180	Many people told of strange fireballs, strange events that occurred around August of 1974,
2367180	2369800	but we really don't have too much to work off of.
2369800	2374340	In a frustrating recent event, we can look to Jesus Alberto, Mexican government official
2374340	2376780	who sets up legislation and hearings.
2376780	2382420	Alberto is currently tasked with UFO disclosure and is intimately tied to the Nazca mummies.
2382420	2388340	On March 16th of 2024, Jay Alberto posted a now deleted tweet translated to, I have the
2388340	2390180	vid at your time.
2390180	2391940	It's a shit from another world.
2391940	2396820	Some context around this tweet showed it to be referencing the 1974 Coyamae incident.
2396820	2402100	I asked Jay Alberto if he was indeed referencing the Coyamae incident and if so would he share
2402100	2403500	the video with me.
2403500	2408140	The only response I got was a thumbs up about the video referencing the crash.
2408140	2412820	In follow up messages, I inquired how I might get my hands on the video or if Alberto had
2412820	2417780	any witnesses, military or civilian I could speak to, or any military documents on the
2417780	2420180	case he might be able to share with me.
2420180	2423060	All requests were met with no response.
2423060	2427420	I'm hoping this video can put some pressure on him to indeed release whatever video he
2427420	2429620	is referring to.
2429620	2434260	What's up guys, thank you so much for watching and joining me as we did this deep dive into
2434260	2438020	the 1974 Coyamae UFO crash.
2438020	2444300	If you're anything like me, this story is fascinating and super perplexing with so many
2444300	2447740	interesting details that lead into ufology at large.
2447740	2452540	But at the same time, we're left with very little documentation and resources to investigate
2452540	2454180	this further.
2454180	2459180	Part of the purpose of this video was to lay out the facts as we know of this case.
2459180	2465340	The Dineb report, the alterations to the Wikipedia page, the eyewitnesses, some aspects of the
2465340	2470940	American recovery team in the CIA's involvement in other retrieval operations allegedly, according
2470940	2475660	to Chris Sharpe, put that all out there and see where this investigation can go.
2475660	2480940	I know when this video goes live I will be tweeting this video at Jesus Alberto, really
2480940	2484620	putting some pressure and asking him to release this video.
2484620	2488780	This case is so interesting whatever video this is, whether it's reconnaissance aircraft
2488780	2493500	overflight or any internal Mexican government documents on this case.
2493500	2498700	Any sort of video evidence, even if it is a truck convoy of Mexican soldiers entering
2498700	2503860	up north from Coyamae around the same date, could prove paramount in adding to this case.
2503860	2507820	I know I said it in the video, but I'm also trying to learn from Ryan S. Wood, who I met
2507820	2512740	by the way, which was awesome, I'll tell you guys all about that more, but in how to
2512740	2517500	access actual service records and personal archives to learn more about the names listed
2517500	2521420	on the Wikipedia site and isn't that interesting those names added.
2521420	2524620	You know I have scoured the internet, I've gone through every avenue I can trying to
2524620	2529260	find any mention of those names, and when all these names were uploaded together and
2529260	2536820	from what reference Mercy 11 was citing here, Ryan S. Wood is also in contact with Noah
2536820	2542140	Torres and Ruben Uriarte, so I will be trying to talk to these authors to learn more and
2542140	2546660	actually talk to them, hey did you guys follow up with Mercy, I know Mercy shut them down
2546660	2551660	trying to actually get to know him and so forth, but you know let's see what they have
2551660	2557020	uncovered because that document and their connection with Mercy occurred back in 2011,
2557020	2559820	so who knows what they have uncovered since.
2559820	2563500	What do you guys think of the case, are there any details I am missing, I still like to
2563500	2569980	play with the fact the US recovery team actually killed the operators, the Mexican recovery
2569980	2570980	team.
2570980	2575460	I know that the Dineb report states that there was likely the chemical or biological agent
2575460	2580340	that killed these guys and we also have the IPU and majestic documents too, kind of reference
2580340	2584380	there and isn't that interesting the Sandia lab technicians, I know the MJ12 likes to
2584380	2588900	reference Sandia at Kirtland Air Force Base quite a bit, as we saw in the Eisenhower
2588900	2595700	briefing document in the 1950's slash 1955 El Indio slash Del Rio crash retrieval cases,
2595700	2603380	which are pretty interesting, but you know the idea of being contaminated by craft and
2603380	2607500	suffering ill effects is something I'd like to explore further.
2607500	2611580	Remember in the whistleblower, the infographics whistleblower video, this whistleblower stated
2611580	2617780	one of the first things that people do upon receiving a down craft is send in a team to
2617780	2622740	analyze for any toxicity or any hazardous chemicals surrounding the craft, stands to
2622740	2626860	reason this Mexican recovery team if they had never recovered a craft went in with soldiers
2626860	2632540	with no additional protective gear and thus died from exposure, but what if the American
2632540	2636900	recovery team did kill these soldiers, but let me know what you guys think about the
2636900	2641660	involvement of the American recovery team and the case at large, I'm willing to bet
2641660	2645660	a lot of you guys haven't really heard of this case or just kind of heard it in passing
2645660	2647500	a little bit.
2647500	2651500	I can't exactly remember the first time I ever heard of this case, but I think it was
2651500	2657140	when the UAP caucus listed a list of a crash retrieval events to kind of pay attention to
2657140	2661940	and to bring before Congress and I think either from there or from an offshoot of there I
2661940	2666900	heard of this case and quickly afterwards I dove into it and found it so fascinating,
2666900	2673420	especially just some of these details like a craft and a small passenger plane colliding.
2673420	2678300	I know this story just requires a couple pieces of evidence to help verify further.
2678300	2680060	That's why it's so frustrating.
2680060	2684420	As well as diving into the origins of the Dineb report, Elaine Douglas, the researcher
2684420	2688700	I spoke about who actually received the Dineb report, she passed away in 2014.
2688700	2689700	She had a website.
2689700	2694100	It was www.alaindouglas.com that actually had documents.
2694100	2697000	I think it had a scan of the original Dineb report.
2697000	2704040	When she passed, apparently her family was going to maintain her website, but no, the
2704040	2706080	website is available in the web archive.
2706080	2710200	I will link it in the video description, but if you try and go to the links to the Koyama
2710200	2711880	instant, those are all missing.
2711880	2714080	So that's very frustrating in itself.
2714080	2718120	Ryan S. Wood also doesn't have the copies of the original document because it would
2718120	2722720	be very great to put these kind of through a forensic test as Wood does with the MJ12
2722720	2723720	documents.
2723720	2726000	But anyway, guys, again, let me know what you think about the case.
2726000	2729300	Do you have any other details I glossed over in this because I've really tried to scrounge
2729300	2732760	as much as I can for any information on this case.
2732760	2736960	Coming up, guys, a lot of interesting videos, a lot of crash retrievals I'm going to focus
2736960	2737960	on, a lot of hidden programs.
2737960	2741600	I'm going to do a video on the IPU now that I've met with Ryan S. Wood.
2741600	2747880	We are going to do a video on the MJ12 documents, a very kind of comprehensive documentary and
2747880	2751320	overview of the MJ12 using his expertise.
2751320	2755600	I also want to make a video solely on the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual I spoke
2755680	2761960	about in the last video, which Ryan Wood considers to be the most crucial piece of the MJ12 documents.
2761960	2765400	Besides that, of course, crash retrievals, hopefully some good interviews coming up,
2765400	2766400	I hope so.
2766400	2767400	We'll see about that.
2767400	2768680	But thank you guys so much for watching.
