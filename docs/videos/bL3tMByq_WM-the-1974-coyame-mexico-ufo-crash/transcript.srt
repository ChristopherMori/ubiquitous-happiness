1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,400
In fact, many countries around the world have stories of crashes of non-human intelligence

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,680
that rival the intrigue, cover-up, and credibility of the infamous crash that occurred in the

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,600
New Mexico Desert in 1947.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,920
Whether this be Shag Harbor Canada, Maje Brazil, or others, tantalizing and perplexing stories

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,920
of UFO crashes are not isolated to the United States.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,520
So today, let's investigate a severely underexplored UFO retrieval case that may give us the greatest

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,840
insights into U.S. craft recovery protocol that allegedly occurred in northern Mexico

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,440
in Coyame, Chihuahua, in the summer of 1974.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,960
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so much for joining me today as we dive into a

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,760
gripping and underrepresented crash retrieval case commonly referred to by authors as Mexico's

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,040
Roswell.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,840
This case features an astounding tale to rival any case of a downed UAP, a classic crash

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,560
disk, U.S. Special Forces recovery, a mysterious leaked report describing the event, the death

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,000
of the Mexican military retrieval force, and much, much more.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,040
Is this case that has hardly seen any covering factor fiction?

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,160
Join me today as we try and find out.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,120
And before we get started, it is worth noting primary sources for this case are few and

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,480
far between.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,960
I will primarily be referencing the work of authors and first-hand investigators into

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,280
the Coyame case, Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte and their book, Mexico's Roswell, the Chihuahua

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,080
UFO Crash, and follow-up piece, The Coyome Incident, as well as Leonard Stringfield's

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,080
UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report 7 Part 9, and Ryan S. Wood's masterpiece, Magic Eyes

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,600
Only, which gives this case a medium to high level of authenticity.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,840
In the early 1980s, whispers of a 1974 collision between a small private plane and disk-shaped

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,680
UFO occurring near Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico began circulating.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,140
Tales of dead Mexican soldiers who initially recovered the craft in an American recovering

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,600
team who relieved the corpses of the craft wreckage began to rise and follow these whispers.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,400
In 1994, legendary UFO crash retrieval researcher Leonard Stringfield would state, quote,

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,080
I heard of the Chihuahua case before, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s.

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,160
The only detail I vaguely recall is that the U.S. military team had covertly crossed into

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,000
Mexico to retrieve the object, end quote.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,600
It wasn't until 1992 on an electronic bulletin board, an anomalous document titled, quote,

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,340
Research Finding on Chihuahua Disk Crash, end quote, would be posted, commonly referred

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,960
to as the Dineb Report, which we will discuss in much greater detail later.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,600
This shadowy, possibly leaked or purposefully leaked memo of unknown origin details the

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,000
communications of one J.S. to all Dineb team members.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,960
In early summer of 1993, paper copies of this document would be mailed anonymously to UFO

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,320
researchers such as Elaine Douglas, who shared the original documents with Stringfield.

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,840
This anonymous mailing to select researchers reminds me strongly of the origins of the

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,200
MJ-12 documents.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,840
The Dineb Report serves as our primary document describing this case.

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,520
I find it crucial to read this document in its entirety as it serves as the greatest

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,200
analysis of this mysterious case.

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Afterwards, we will investigate some of the key aspects of this report and event further,

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,400
so without further ado, let's dive right into this 1974 recovery story.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,400
To all Dineb team members from J.S. date, 23rd March 1992, subject, Research Findings

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,640
on the Chihuahua Disk Crash, text.

49
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,920
In 25 Augs 74 at 2207 hours, U.S. air defense radar detected an unknown approaching U.S.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,280
airspace from the Gulf of Mexico.

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Originally, the object was tracked at 2200 knots on a bearing of 325 degrees and an altitude

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,360
of 75,000 feet, a course that would intercept U.S. territory about 40 miles southwest of

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,480
Corpus Christi, Texas.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,640
After approximately 60 seconds of observation at a position of 155 miles southeast of Corpus

55
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,840
Christi, the object simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots, turning to a

56
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
heading of 290 degrees and began a slow descent.

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,960
It entered Mexican airspace approximately 40 miles southwest of Brownsville, Texas.

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,320
Radar attracted approximately 500 miles to a point near the town of Coyame in the state

59
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,160
of Chihuahua not far from the U.S. border.

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,320
There, the object suddenly disappeared from the radar screens.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,400
During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at 45,000 feet, then descended

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,920
to 20,000 feet.

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,120
The descent was in level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level was

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,160
maintained for approximately 5 minutes.

65
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,820
The object was tracked by two different military radar installations.

66
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,720
It would have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it is assumed that no

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,320
civilian radar detected the object due to a lack of any such reports.

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,960
The point of disappearance from radar screens was over a barren and sparsely populated area

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,380
of northern Mexico.

70
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,560
At first, it was assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon, and

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,760
a watch was kept for any reemergence of the object.

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,920
None occurred.

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,000
At first, it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because of the high speed and

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,960
descending flight path, but meteors normally travel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,200
arc, not in steps.

76
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,320
And meteors do not normally make a 35 degree change in course.

77
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,640
Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called.

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,160
However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, the object turned to a course

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,280
that would not immediately take it over US territory.

80
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,880
The alert was called off within 20 minutes after the object's disappearance from the

81
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
radar screen.

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,040
52 minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic indicated that a civilian craft

83
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
had gone down in that area.

84
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,880
But it was clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso International with a

85
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,200
destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have been tracked over the Gulf

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,540
of Mexico.

87
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,200
It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area at the same time.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,680
Within daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for the missing plane.

89
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radio report that records from the missing plane

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,640
had been spotted from the air.

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,800
Just immediately came a report of a second plane on the ground a few miles from the first.

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,360
After a few minutes, an additional report stated the second plane was circular shaped

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,320
and apparently in one piece, although damaged.

94
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,880
A few minutes after that, the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts.

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,880
The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two

96
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,440
additional government agencies also received reports.

97
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,280
But such has not been confirmed as of this date.

98
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,840
The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.

99
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,840
The speed with which this team and equipment was assembled suggests that this was either

100
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,160
a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event.

101
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,000
In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,360
and Mexican government that the U.S. recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to

103
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,680
quote-unquote assist.

104
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,800
These reports were met with professional ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation.

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,320
By 2100 hours, 26 AUG 74, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort Bliss.

106
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,720
Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured area.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,360
These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Eyewitness indicates that there are three smaller craft, very probably UH-1 Hueys from

109
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
the description.

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,200
There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a sea stallion.

111
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,400
All from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Fort Bliss personnel.

112
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,440
Satellite and Recognizant's aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crash disc

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,400
and civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded onto flatbed trucks.

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,240
Later flights confirmed the convoy had departed the area heading south.

115
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,360
At that point, the CIA had to make a choice, either to allow this unknown aircraft to stay

116
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,360
in the hands of the Mexican government or to launch the recovery team, supplemented by

117
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,040
any required military support to take the craft.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,040
There occurred, however, an event that took the choice out of their hands.

119
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,840
High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited

120
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,160
areas or major roads.

121
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,200
Recogn showed no activity and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters

122
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
had ceased.

123
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,840
At low altitude, high-speed overflight was ordered.

124
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,720
The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with doors

125
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
open and two human bodies laying on the ground beside the two vehicles.

126
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,040
The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team, but the actual launching

127
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,960
was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel.

128
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,000
It was not until 1438 hours that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,760
The four helicopters followed the border down to Bercito, then turned and entered Mexican

130
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,360
airspace north of Candelaria.

131
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,160
They were over the convoy site at 1653 hours.

132
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,400
All convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks.

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Some recovery team members dressed in bioprotection suits reconfigured the straps holding the

134
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,460
object onto the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the sea stallion.

135
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,820
By 1714 hours, the recovered object was on its way to US territory.

136
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,080
Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery team gathered together the Mexican

137
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,700
vehicle and bodies, then destroyed all with high explosives.

138
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,780
This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air

139
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,980
collision.

140
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,380
At 1746 hours, the Hueys departed.

141
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,620
The Hueys caught up with the sea stallion as it re-entered US airspace.

142
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,980
The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately 25 miles

143
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,660
northeast of Valentine.

144
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,580
There, they landed and waited until 0-2-5 hours the next morning.

145
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,260
At that time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with the small convoy on the road

146
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,740
besides Van Horn and Kent.

147
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,420
The recovered disc was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being

148
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
sealed totally.

149
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,940
Some of the personnel from the Hueys transferred to the convoy.

150
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,100
All helicopters then returned to their original basis for decontamination procedures.

151
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,220
The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways and staying away

152
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,660
from cities.

153
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,700
The destination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia.

154
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,820
Here the hard evidence thins out.

155
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,780
One unconfirmed report says the disc was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

156
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,180
Another says that the disc was either transferred after that to another unnamed base or was

157
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,100
taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta.

158
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,860
The best description of this disc was that it was 16 feet 5 inches in diameter, convex

159
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,540
on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows.

160
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,380
The thickness was slightly less than 5 feet.

161
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,660
The color was silver, much like polished steel.

162
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,220
There were no visible lights nor any propulsion means, there were no markings.

163
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,340
There were two areas of the rim that showed damage.

164
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,420
One showing in a regular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal around

165
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
it.

166
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,260
The other damage was described as a quote-unquote dent, about 2 feet wide.

167
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,180
The weight of the object was estimated as approximately 1,500 pounds, based on the effect

168
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,460
of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck.

169
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,980
There was no indication in the document available as to whether anything else was visible in

170
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,100
the quote-unquote hole.

171
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,860
It seemed likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the

172
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,660
civilian craft.

173
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:24,060
That collision occurred while the object was traveling at approximately 1,955 miles per

174
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,300
hour.

175
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,500
Even ignoring the speed of the civilian craft, the impact would have been considerable at

176
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,860
that speed.

177
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,220
This is an agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being quote, almost

178
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,860
totally destroyed end quote.

179
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,900
What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of the civilian craft.

180
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,060
The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with the ground.

181
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,580
The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact.

182
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,300
No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian craft.

183
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,260
It is not known if any body or bodies were discovered.

184
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,420
Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies may well

185
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,740
have not come down near the larger pieces.

186
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,020
Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known.

187
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,780
Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disc as a result of the damage to

188
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,220
a microbiological agent.

189
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,700
There are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team.

190
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,700
It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back

191
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,660
with them for analysis, but there is no indication of that happening.

192
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,980
Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what may have been a biologically

193
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,900
contaminated body.

194
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,940
Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because

195
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,900
it does not involve a U.S. aircraft, nor did it occur over U.S. airspace.

196
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,660
It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story.

197
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,360
Nothing is known of the analysis of the craft nor its contents.

198
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,820
Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign recovery team, nor is it

199
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,060
known if this craft was manned or not.

200
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,180
Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disc be taken to Atlanta, and where

201
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,780
did the disc come from?

202
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,180
It was first detected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U.S. air defenses

203
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,060
extend to a much greater distance than that.

204
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,940
If the object descended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD's space tracking has some record

205
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,460
of the object.

206
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,340
Alternate possibility is that it entered the Gulf of Mexico under radar limits, then, quote

207
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,540
unquote, jumped up to 75,000 feet.

208
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,340
Considering prior behavior exhibited by discs of this size, it is probable that the entry

209
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,660
was from orbital altitude.

210
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,380
The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness accounts.

211
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,220
Documentation illegally copied and a partially destroyed document.

212
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,380
This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.

213
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,260
Only in February of this year did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group.

214
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:06,180
End of document.

215
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,300
Very little, and I mean very little, is known about the origins of this mysterious-to-never

216
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
report.

217
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,680
As mentioned above, the document first appeared on early message boards in 1992, before being

218
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,340
anonymously mailed to researchers such as Elaine Douglas and Nick Redfern.

219
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,100
Immediately, copies made their way into the hands of Leonard Stringfield in his sublime

220
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,060
crash retrieval status report stating, quote, reviewing the text of the report initial JS

221
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,580
which follows, I find that it is authoritatively written, using correct military terminology

222
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:45,220
and of note and unlike a hoax, draws the line between so-called hard evidence and that which

223
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,980
is speculative, end quote.

224
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,500
What is crucial to remember here is Stringfield had heard rumors of this case around a decade

225
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,660
prior, and let's note in Stringfield's own words, when presenting his initial retrievals

226
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,340
of the third kind at Mufon in 1978, he was, quote, unquote, informed circuitously by the

227
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,940
CIA several days in advance.

228
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,300
It would be inadvisable for him to discuss crash information in Mexico or West Germany.

229
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,940
So the author of this piece, JS, seems to have intimate knowledge gathered by primary

230
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,620
sources about the incident and desired the release of evidence to interested parties,

231
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
i.e. the Deneb team.

232
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,300
Is JS an acronym or a name?

233
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,380
While Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte hypothesize JS is an acronym for a department within the

234
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,780
US government, such as joint staff or joint services, perhaps the Deneb team was a name

235
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,940
for an internal USG investigation group during the, quote, unquote, dark ages of UAP, as

236
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,540
I like to call them.

237
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,740
We know there is a massive gap of any official UAP programs within USG, from the ending of

238
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,140
Blue Book in 1969 to the creation of ASAP slash ATIP in 2007, and from the words of

239
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,420
Lu Elizondo, we do know unknown UAP programs were operating in the 1980s.

240
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,340
Or with recent revelations of the UAP task force utilizing top secret online forums

241
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:12,340
to discuss UAP, maybe the Deneb team was a similar group of intelligence community professionals

242
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,260
who used the early internet message boards to discuss obfuscated data on crash retrieval

243
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,500
cases.

244
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,340
What is also interesting to note is the, quote, file UFO 3263, and, quote, indicating the

245
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,860
Koyame report is one of many studied by Deneb and JS.

246
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,780
Whether JS is an individual or group with intimate knowledge into the Koyome incident,

247
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,380
it seems the author does not have a direct line of information from the named CIA, NORAD,

248
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,660
or other agencies we kind of guess, such as the NRO or NGA.

249
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,660
The facts were, quote, gathered from two eyewitness accounts, documentation illegally copied and

250
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,820
a partially destroyed document.

251
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,500
This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.

252
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,740
Only in February of this year, 1992, did the notes and documents come into the hands of

253
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,340
our group, end quote.

254
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,140
JS even states multiple times, he or they are unaware of the analysis of the craft,

255
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,420
the craft's ultimate destination, and other details such as the inclusion of bodies.

256
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,620
Deneb itself is a highly luminous blue star originated in the constellation Cygnus, one

257
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,740
of the eldest constellations recognized by early civilizations.

258
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,860
The star is a supergiant with luminosity equal to 60,000 souls or Earth's suns.

259
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,380
The Milky Way's Great Rift, a critical junction in the galaxy where the Milky Way splits into

260
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,340
two long sides, begins near Deneb into Cygnus.

261
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,980
This particular area held special significance to ancient stargazers, and of particular note,

262
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:52,980
southern Mexico shamans who referred to the rift as Zibalba B, the birth of all life.

263
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,740
The Deneb report describes an extremely unlikely chance of a collision between a UFO with a

264
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,500
civilian light plane, which is one of the most key aspects to this case.

265
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,820
According to the report, civilian air traffic had indicated the crash of a civilian aircraft

266
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,620
along the route of El Paso, Texas to Mexico City.

267
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,780
The Deneb team made inquiries into the FAA to identify the airport, but received no documents

268
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,580
concluding the plane was of Mexican origin.

269
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,060
And unfortunately, examining U.S. 1974 aircraft crashes such as aircraft accident reports

270
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,180
from Embry Riddle University yields no results either.

271
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,580
Aviation Safety Network additionally lists no crashes in the year of 1974 occurring in

272
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,100
Mexico.

273
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,500
Many researchers such as Torres and Uriarte believe the craft would have been a Cessna

274
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,740
180 light aircraft.

275
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,540
This is due to the last detection of the UFO by U.S. air defense radar at 20,000 feet

276
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
or under.

277
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:53,500
Since this aircraft has a service ceiling of 17,700 feet, the authors of Mexico's Roswell

278
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,500
guessed the craft to be a perfect fit for a covert, low altitude, and slow speed craft.

279
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,540
So if this case is real, that likely leaves us with a craft performing illegal operations

280
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,620
in a Cessna 180 such as drug smuggling operations.

281
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,940
In 1974, anti-drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico was an extremely pertinent issue.

282
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,700
Let's reference this discussion between U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Mexican President

283
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,660
that occurred on October 21, 1974, just two months after our crash story.

284
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,020
The Mexican President states, quote, along the 3,000 kilometer border, it is very easy

285
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,660
for small planes to take off and land in small private ranches.

286
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,380
According to Torres and Uriartes' follow-up book to Mexico's Roswell the Coyame Incident,

287
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,780
the two mentioned the August 1974 death of a 50-year-old Mexican pilot Enrique Riviera

288
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,860
Gutierrez as reported in El Fronterizo of Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua.

289
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,900
I've personally been unable to track this paper, but the authors discussed that the

290
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,780
man died on August 30, 1974 from horrific injuries sustained in a plane crash on an

291
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,220
unknown date prior to the article.

292
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,860
The authors argue this could possibly be the pilot mentioned in the Dineb report, but

293
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,780
I find that highly unlikely, due to the collision of a UFO and private plane at thousands of

294
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,180
feet altitude.

295
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,740
Beside some alleged aircraft parts discovered in the crash region by Torres and Uriartes,

296
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,980
we really have nothing to work with here in terms of tracking down this plane.

297
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,820
The Dineb reports makes numerous mention to the CIA, quote, the radio interceptions

298
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,780
were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two additional government

299
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,940
agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date.

300
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,140
The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.

301
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,060
The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that it was either

302
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,300
a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event, end quote.

303
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,380
I am once again drawn to this article by the incredible Christopher Sharpe, which accuses

304
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,500
the CIA's Office of Global Access of playing a central role in UFO crash retrieval since

305
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,100
2003.

306
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,780
The article states the OGA coordinates with Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, amongst

307
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,580
others to collect craft.

308
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,340
The implication of the CIA and the Dineb report leads us to suspect departments within the

309
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,060
CIA have engaged in crash retrievals far before the OGA's creation in 2003.

310
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:31,620
And unfortunately, we can find CIA FOIA requests such as F-2007-00637 alleged mid-air collisions

311
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:37,940
near Coyame, Mexico on 825 or 26 1974 with no results.

312
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,580
However, we still do have some really interesting clues to pursue.

313
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,980
The role of the OGA in UFO crash retrievals as described by Sharpe's anonymous source

314
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,780
closely resembles the role of the CIA in the Dineb report.

315
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,460
According to Sharpe's source, quote, they are basically a facilitator for people to get

316
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,580
in and out of countries.

317
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,300
They are very clever at being able to get anywhere in the world they want to, end quote.

318
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,860
And an additional source of Sharpe stated, quote, the task at hand is simply to get into

319
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,020
the custody and protect the secrecy of it.

320
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,740
The actual physical retrieval is done by the military, but it's not kept under military

321
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,740
control because they have to keep too many records, so they start moving it out fairly

322
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,380
quickly into private hands, end quote.

323
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,140
In the Dineb report, the CIA gathered intelligence on the UFO and assembled a recovery team who

324
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,780
we will later learn may have all been retired U.S. armed forces.

325
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,620
The UFO was then taken covertly by an unknown convoy to Atlanta, Georgia where, by the way,

326
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,140
we can find a Lockheed Martin complex located in Air Force Plant 6, less than 30 miles outside

327
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
of Atlanta.

328
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,220
In Lockheed's own words, this location offers, quote, skunkworks work in advanced development,

329
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
end quote.

330
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,940
And while Lockheed Martin was founded in 1995, we can clearly see one of its precursors,

331
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,860
the Lockheed Company, engaged in C-130 work in Marietta, Georgia since the 1950s.

332
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,300
And what's even stranger here is the existence of the Lockheed Martin Georgia Nuclear Aircraft

333
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,340
Laboratory known as AFP number 67, which served as Lockheed's lab for investigating the feasibility

334
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,180
of nuclear aircraft.

335
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,260
The site was closed in 1971 and acquired by the city of Atlanta, but this is still a very

336
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,900
interesting connection.

337
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,220
Two sources in the Daily Mail told Sharp, alongside JSOC, nuclear weapons experts such

338
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,020
as the Nuclear Emergency Support Team or NEST perform retrieval operations.

339
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,980
With this in mind, the Koyame case reminds me of another case we covered a lot earlier,

340
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,860
Jonathan Wagan.

341
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,100
Let's remember the details of this testimony.

342
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,220
What is confirmable here is the CIA's involvement in 1997's Operation Laser Strike in Peru

343
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,820
to engage counter-narcotics.

344
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,460
According to Wagan, the personnel he encountered after observing a crashed UAP in the jungles

345
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,820
of Peru approached him from a nearby land at CH-47 twin rotor copter.

346
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,800
The men's uniforms range from black fatigues, DOE rain jackets, and hazmat suits.

347
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,780
In this video, I went into why NEST were likely candidates for the team Wagan encountered.

348
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,260
A key relation to Koyame here is the presence of hazmat suits and the adverse mental effects

349
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,660
Wagan claimed to have suffered such as intense and unexplainable fear when close to the craft.

350
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,660
According to the report, this rapid reaction team was flown from their staging area in

351
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:30,260
Fort Bliss, Texas to the crash site from four helicopters, guest by JS to be UH-1 Hueys and

352
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,300
one larger helicopter like a CH-53 Super Stallion.

353
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,740
The helicopters were flown in from an unknown location and assembled in a secure area.

354
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,900
Crucial to note, JS states these craft were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.

355
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,580
Signifying the vehicles may have been utilized specifically for clandestine operations.

356
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,980
Fort Bliss may sound familiar to some, and in fact may be crucial to research moving

357
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
forward.

358
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,020
Fort Bliss is mentioned by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his book The Day After Roswell.

359
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,180
According to Corso, debris and bodies from the 1947 Roswell crash were shipped to Fort

360
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,580
Bliss, Texas.

361
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,580
There aren't many other connections to Fort Bliss and UAP besides a handful of blue book

362
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,340
sighting, but this really could be some interesting research going forward.

363
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,060
And a quick side note, the team was allegedly given intelligence by the CIA gathered from

364
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:26,180
satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight of the disk in plane collision.

365
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,740
Intelligence via plane may have come from the El Paso Intelligence Center, known as Epic,

366
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:38,780
established at Fort Bliss in 1974, possibly an EP-3E established in 1972, and the satellite

367
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,820
imagery as discussed by Noah Torres likely came from the fleet of keyhole spy satellites

368
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,820
put into orbit around 1971.

369
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,180
These satellites were primarily operated by the NRO.

370
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,700
Perhaps this is one instance of highly classified, high-res satellite imagery of crashed UAP

371
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,540
David Grush has referred to.

372
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,460
Curious to me here is how the Dinep report states once surveillance showed the Mexican

373
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,700
convoy had stopped an aerial photography show two soldiers laying motionless on the ground,

374
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,460
the recovery team's departure was delayed for the arrival of additional equipment, presumably

375
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,380
hazard protection and explosives, and two additional personnel.

376
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,780
Who were these additional personnel and were they possibly munitions experts sent to scrub

377
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,820
contaminated crash sites?

378
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,940
Upon securing the craft, the team loaded the vehicle onto a large truck and proceeded

379
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,660
to original base for decontamination.

380
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,540
But before leaving the site, the Dinep report states the Mexican vehicles, bodies, and civilian

381
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,740
light plane were all destroyed with high explosives.

382
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,220
This haste to destroy the site, delayed departure for additional crew, and refusal to bring

383
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,540
Mexican bodies back for analysis, leads me to believe the American recovery team were

384
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,780
possibly aware of the contamination that killed the soldiers beforehand and had highly trained

385
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,820
explosive experts desanitize the site.

386
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,780
Noah Torres wonders if the explosive used was an MK-54 SADM suitcase nuke.

387
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,980
Carrying the smallest yield of 10 tons, such an explosive would effectively sterilize the

388
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,060
site while keeping residual effects and damage to local population almost null.

389
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,580
After all, in his 2000 paper Radiation Neutralization of Stored Biological Warfare Agents with Low

390
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,500
Yield Nuclear Warheads, Hans Kruger argues fissile debris and fireballs can actually

391
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,420
destroy biological agents.

392
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,740
Initially when reading the Dinep report and still partly to today, I wonder if the US

393
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,220
recovery team had killed the Mexican soldiers.

394
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
J.S.

395
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,460
and Dinep do not have the full picture here yet seem to have some understanding what happened

396
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,700
to the men, quote, unfortunately what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is

397
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,500
not known.

398
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,300
Speculation ranges from a chemical release from the disc as a result of the damage to

399
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,940
a microbiological agent, end quote.

400
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,140
There still remains the possibility that the US team did in fact kill the soldiers in a

401
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,020
hasty decision to prevent them from returning to base with UAP debris, and this does warrant

402
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,620
further investigation.

403
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,660
I can't help but to think back to David Grush, who mentioned numerous times crimes

404
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,500
had been committed to maintain UAP secrecy.

405
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,060
So if we adhere to Dinep, some contaminant from the down saucer led to the deaths of

406
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,220
all soldiers on the Mexican recovery team.

407
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,500
Possibly this was due to handling of bodies, reminding me of the police officer who allegedly

408
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,460
died after touching a non-human intelligence bean in the Varginia Brazil case.

409
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,260
But the report makes specific mention it is unaware if the disc was manned or not.

410
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,540
Possibly the contaminant leaked from the quote, irregular hole approximately 12 inches in

411
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,980
diameter with indented metal around it, end quote, observed on the crashed craft.

412
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,780
Fantastic enough we do have some absolutely fascinating references here, nestled within

413
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:51,100
the MJ-12 first annual report lies a passage within Section F, government policy of control

414
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,600
and denial.

415
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,060
Here the Majestic-12 panel cites their concern regarding several SED, Sandia National Labs

416
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,620
personnel who came in contact with UFO debris and bodies.

417
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,020
One technician collapsed while attempting removal of a body, one went into a coma for

418
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,140
four hours when attempting to place an NHI body in a bag.

419
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,520
All four technicians who suffered effects were rushed to Los Alamos but all four died

420
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,140
of seizures and profuse bleeding.

421
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,740
The report states upon inconclusive autopsies it appeared all four suffered from some form

422
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,540
of toxin or highly contagious disease, extremely disturbing here as point 13 which states quote

423
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,300
in the opinion of the senior atomic energy medical advisor, current medical equipment

424
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,620
and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with a large scale outbreak of the alien virus

425
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,820
end quote.

426
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
But that's not all.

427
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,580
I recently spoke about the US Army's brief interplanetary phenomenon unit denied to exist

428
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,740
but proven through FOIA requests and only remembered by the Army through institutional memory.

429
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,780
This unit was an Army in-house project and an interest item for an unnamed assistant

430
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,220
chief of staff for intelligence.

431
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,660
Well within Ryan S. Woods Majestic-12 files we can find an IPU summary report.

432
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,740
This document discusses that all military and civilian personnel dealing with recovery

433
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,900
operations operated on strictly need to know intelligence.

434
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,620
Besides mention of the Kirtland crew performing functions very well, the report discusses

435
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,780
severe nervous breakdowns and suicides by MPs.

436
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,900
The report then goes on to state ground personnel from Sandia experienced some form of contamination

437
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,220
resulting in the deaths of three technicians.

438
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,700
So as far back as the 1940s according to the majestic documents technicians and other

439
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:42,580
personnel have actually died from biological or toxic effects from craft and bodies.

440
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,260
One of the most fascinating and possibly fruitful aspects of this investigations come from the

441
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,580
open sourced encyclopedia site Wikipedia.

442
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,060
Since 2008 Wikipedia featured a brief report on the Koyama UFO crash referencing the Dineb

443
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:01,140
report, a UFO casebook article, link in the description, and one of our references Mexico's

444
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,740
Roswell by Torres and Uriarte.

445
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,220
The entry featured nothing new or noteworthy and that remained the case until September

446
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:15,580
of 2012 when user Mercy 11 radically altered the article, adding names and intriguing details

447
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,540
for the US recovery team and crash in general.

448
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,380
Quote, at the US military radar airbase four Huey helicopters were readied up as well as

449
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,220
a 15 man recovery team headed to Koyama, Mexico.

450
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,300
The American group included Captain Lawrence Murley, Lieutenant Randall Bishop, Lieutenant

451
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,060
Eduardo Ramirez, Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes, Sergeant Terrence Miles, and Lieutenant Jerome

452
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Smith, all retired US armed forces personnel.

453
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,900
The group entered Mexico surreptitiously after intercepting a Mexican radio communication

454
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,260
giving away the location of the crash site, end quote.

455
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:56,020
Besides the names listed which we will explore shortly, Mercy 11 added two spectacular pieces

456
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,420
of information.

457
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,500
The recovery team included 15 members and all were retired US armed forces personnel.

458
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:09,660
This suggests the recovery team was not involving active military, but some experienced, assembled,

459
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,700
possibly private industry seasoned operators adjacent to US military and the intelligence

460
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,740
community.

461
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,180
But Mercy 11's additions don't stop here.

462
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,300
The user seemingly adds names for all four deceased Mexican soldiers, quote, a short

463
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,180
distance from the wreckage was also an olive green jeep belonging to the Mexican military

464
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,020
and containing the bodies of four Mexican soldiers in it.

465
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:39,340
The soldiers were Captain Rogelio Argueyes-Gonzalez, Sergeant Teofilo Margarito Puebla, Corporal

466
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,300
Jose Trinidad Maraz, and Corporal Ricardo Velasquez, their bodies displayed signs of

467
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,820
death by asphyxiation, end quote.

468
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,780
And here is where the story gets strange, the author of Mexico's Roswell attempted

469
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,420
to reach out to Mercy to discover where the user sourced this information, especially

470
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,860
due to the fact existing citation for this section on a history and event cited the

471
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,020
UFO casebook article mentioned above in a documentary titled UFO Hunters Unexplained

472
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,860
Mexico's Roswell the Koyame Crash, neither of which featured any of this information.

473
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,260
Yuriyate and Torres received a response from Mercy 11 in regards to where he found this

474
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,540
information, but Mercy doubled down linking once again to this UFO Hunters episode.

475
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,300
Upon following up, Mercy 11 stated, quote, I suspect what happened is that I saw the

476
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,300
information at some other site, which I had on my screen at the moment, but in another

477
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,660
window, which I failed to attribute and record properly, end quote.

478
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:40,940
But again, does not link to this information which I nor any other researcher can find.

479
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,780
Soon after these 2013 correspondences, we find the entire page for the incident deleted

480
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,780
in 2014 by admin Scotty Wong, who shortly after retired his account.

481
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,060
The entirety of this Wikipedia page's existence is incredibly suspicious, but let's try

482
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,980
to analyze the data given.

483
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,940
We are given a list of American names and to be honest, very little to work with.

484
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:09,460
I can find almost nothing about Captain Slorence Murley, discovering only one Utah-based individual

485
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,180
who left for the armed forces near the tail end of World War II, no rank or detail of

486
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,760
service are given.

487
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,680
Other data or lack thereof is available for Lieutenant Randall Bishop.

488
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,400
We can find an Indiana man who lived from 1932 to 2020.

489
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,340
Bishop was a Pershing Rifles member while attending the University of Kentucky.

490
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,600
He left university to join the US Air Force where he served in the Korean War as a warzone

491
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,360
air traffic controller.

492
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,880
After his service, Bishop moved to Indiana to be a teacher, but let's take a second

493
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,040
to remember the significance the infographics whistleblower put on the Korean War in the

494
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,560
program, as well as the significance of this general area of Indiana.

495
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,480
Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes has almost zero footprint outside of a famous US Civil War

496
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
soldier.

497
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,760
The only somewhat modern day reference I can find to a Benjamin Rhodes exists within a

498
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,160
1989 issue of American Legion.

499
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,440
One Mr. Rhodes out of Della Field, Wisconsin served as a post commander for the Legion,

500
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,440
however, it is unknown whether he was armed forces or not.

501
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,400
We can find an active duty reference for 1 Terence Miles at the time of April 21, 1993

502
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,480
in this edition of the Guantanamo Bay Gazette, Senior Chief Petty Officer Terence Miles as

503
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,600
mentioned here.

504
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,520
Of course, this breaks Mercy 11's claims that all operators were retired US armed forces,

505
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,080
however, is it possible the sergeant re-enlisted thus furthering his rank?

506
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,120
Zero records are available for 1 Jerome Smith, but if this was a misprint and we are looking

507
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,280
at Lieutenant Jerome Smith, we can find a record.

508
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,080
Deceased in 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Smith served in the US Army and was a World

509
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,280
War II veteran.

510
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,640
Smith transferred branches of service in 1970 to US Public Health Service, where he achieved

511
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
the rank of commander before retiring in 1985.

512
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,880
We can find a private first class at Water Ramirez who served in World War II and earned

513
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,440
a distinguished service cross for bravery in destroying German machine gun nests with

514
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,280
explosives and incendiaries.

515
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,760
There is no record I can find of any promotion to Lieutenant.

516
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,800
And it's key to note, some of these names could be legitimate, all could be legit, or

517
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,040
all made up nonsense from Mercy 11.

518
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,400
We just don't know at this time with all of our source references.

519
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,860
But I am working with prestigious author Ryan S. Wood to really learn how to track down

520
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,460
actual service records of previous soldiers who have served, so I may have some update

521
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,620
on this in the future.

522
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,600
There is only one real lead of the Mexico Soldier's demise, and this comes from Mexican

523
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,440
UFO researcher Alfonso Salazar.

524
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,040
I am unable to locate this article, but Salazar found a newspaper story from El Geraldo de

525
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,960
Chihuahua, dated October 27, 1974, that detailed the death of a group of Mexican soldiers in

526
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:56,720
the crash of a quote-unquote military transport.

527
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,080
With Noah Torres and Ruben Uriartes' field work on this case, such as finding a piece

528
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,800
of airplane debris near the supposed crash site, we do have some witness testimony to

529
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,560
analyze regardless of this crash site being an estimated 60 miles from the nearest town.

530
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,720
One such group of witnesses approached Torres in 2012 at a festival in Presidio, Texas.

531
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,480
School teacher Johnny Chambers and her 10-year-old son at the time remembered seeing a strange

532
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,320
fireball, a quote, big explosion in the sky, end quote, on the Mexican side of the border

533
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,040
near the Coyamae incident.

534
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,980
The two had thought a plane had crashed in the mountain.

535
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,840
When interviewed by Torres, John Chambers stated, within a day of the fireball, several

536
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,920
residents observed a group of military helicopters traveling back into the US from the Mexican

537
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,240
side, including a large twin-rotor helicopter.

538
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,040
And I do think it's important to state these witnesses did appear in 2012, five years after

539
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,160
Torres and Uriartes' initial reporting on the case.

540
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,200
These could be false witnesses, but we really have no way to prove.

541
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,160
Period other witnesses have contacted Torres, such as Melissa P. from Facebook, full name

542
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,280
withheld by Torres, who stated, quote, my uncle was ordered to go to the Mexico Roswell

543
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,160
by the US military.

544
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,200
He went, came back, and was never the same, end quote.

545
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,960
But without names or further evidence, there really isn't much to explore here.

546
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,240
And this is kind of the case for many of the witnesses Torres met along his field investigation

547
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,120
of the Coyamae site.

548
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,180
Many people told of strange fireballs, strange events that occurred around August of 1974,

549
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,800
but we really don't have too much to work off of.

550
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,340
In a frustrating recent event, we can look to Jesus Alberto, Mexican government official

551
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,780
who sets up legislation and hearings.

552
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,420
Alberto is currently tasked with UFO disclosure and is intimately tied to the Nazca mummies.

553
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,340
On March 16th of 2024, Jay Alberto posted a now deleted tweet translated to, I have the

554
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,180
vid at your time.

555
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,940
It's a shit from another world.

556
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,820
Some context around this tweet showed it to be referencing the 1974 Coyamae incident.

557
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,100
I asked Jay Alberto if he was indeed referencing the Coyamae incident and if so would he share

558
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,500
the video with me.

559
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,140
The only response I got was a thumbs up about the video referencing the crash.

560
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,820
In follow up messages, I inquired how I might get my hands on the video or if Alberto had

561
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,780
any witnesses, military or civilian I could speak to, or any military documents on the

562
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,180
case he might be able to share with me.

563
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,060
All requests were met with no response.

564
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,420
I'm hoping this video can put some pressure on him to indeed release whatever video he

565
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,620
is referring to.

566
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,260
What's up guys, thank you so much for watching and joining me as we did this deep dive into

567
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,020
the 1974 Coyamae UFO crash.

568
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:44,300
If you're anything like me, this story is fascinating and super perplexing with so many

569
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,740
interesting details that lead into ufology at large.

570
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,540
But at the same time, we're left with very little documentation and resources to investigate

571
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,180
this further.

572
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,180
Part of the purpose of this video was to lay out the facts as we know of this case.

573
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,340
The Dineb report, the alterations to the Wikipedia page, the eyewitnesses, some aspects of the

574
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,940
American recovery team in the CIA's involvement in other retrieval operations allegedly, according

575
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,660
to Chris Sharpe, put that all out there and see where this investigation can go.

576
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,940
I know when this video goes live I will be tweeting this video at Jesus Alberto, really

577
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,620
putting some pressure and asking him to release this video.

578
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,780
This case is so interesting whatever video this is, whether it's reconnaissance aircraft

579
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,500
overflight or any internal Mexican government documents on this case.

580
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,700
Any sort of video evidence, even if it is a truck convoy of Mexican soldiers entering

581
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,860
up north from Coyamae around the same date, could prove paramount in adding to this case.

582
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,820
I know I said it in the video, but I'm also trying to learn from Ryan S. Wood, who I met

583
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,740
by the way, which was awesome, I'll tell you guys all about that more, but in how to

584
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,500
access actual service records and personal archives to learn more about the names listed

585
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,420
on the Wikipedia site and isn't that interesting those names added.

586
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,620
You know I have scoured the internet, I've gone through every avenue I can trying to

587
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,260
find any mention of those names, and when all these names were uploaded together and

588
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:16,820
from what reference Mercy 11 was citing here, Ryan S. Wood is also in contact with Noah

589
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:22,140
Torres and Ruben Uriarte, so I will be trying to talk to these authors to learn more and

590
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,660
actually talk to them, hey did you guys follow up with Mercy, I know Mercy shut them down

591
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,660
trying to actually get to know him and so forth, but you know let's see what they have

592
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,020
uncovered because that document and their connection with Mercy occurred back in 2011,

593
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,820
so who knows what they have uncovered since.

594
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,500
What do you guys think of the case, are there any details I am missing, I still like to

595
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:49,980
play with the fact the US recovery team actually killed the operators, the Mexican recovery

596
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,980
team.

597
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,460
I know that the Dineb report states that there was likely the chemical or biological agent

598
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,340
that killed these guys and we also have the IPU and majestic documents too, kind of reference

599
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,380
there and isn't that interesting the Sandia lab technicians, I know the MJ12 likes to

600
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,900
reference Sandia at Kirtland Air Force Base quite a bit, as we saw in the Eisenhower

601
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:15,700
briefing document in the 1950's slash 1955 El Indio slash Del Rio crash retrieval cases,

602
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:23,380
which are pretty interesting, but you know the idea of being contaminated by craft and

603
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,500
suffering ill effects is something I'd like to explore further.

604
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,580
Remember in the whistleblower, the infographics whistleblower video, this whistleblower stated

605
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:37,780
one of the first things that people do upon receiving a down craft is send in a team to

606
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,740
analyze for any toxicity or any hazardous chemicals surrounding the craft, stands to

607
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,860
reason this Mexican recovery team if they had never recovered a craft went in with soldiers

608
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,540
with no additional protective gear and thus died from exposure, but what if the American

609
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,900
recovery team did kill these soldiers, but let me know what you guys think about the

610
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,660
involvement of the American recovery team and the case at large, I'm willing to bet

611
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,660
a lot of you guys haven't really heard of this case or just kind of heard it in passing

612
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,500
a little bit.

613
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,500
I can't exactly remember the first time I ever heard of this case, but I think it was

614
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,140
when the UAP caucus listed a list of a crash retrieval events to kind of pay attention to

615
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,940
and to bring before Congress and I think either from there or from an offshoot of there I

616
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,900
heard of this case and quickly afterwards I dove into it and found it so fascinating,

617
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:33,420
especially just some of these details like a craft and a small passenger plane colliding.

618
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,300
I know this story just requires a couple pieces of evidence to help verify further.

619
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,060
That's why it's so frustrating.

620
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,420
As well as diving into the origins of the Dineb report, Elaine Douglas, the researcher

621
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,700
I spoke about who actually received the Dineb report, she passed away in 2014.

622
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
She had a website.

623
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,100
It was www.alaindouglas.com that actually had documents.

624
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,000
I think it had a scan of the original Dineb report.

625
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,040
When she passed, apparently her family was going to maintain her website, but no, the

626
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,080
website is available in the web archive.

627
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,200
I will link it in the video description, but if you try and go to the links to the Koyama

628
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,880
instant, those are all missing.

629
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,080
So that's very frustrating in itself.

630
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,120
Ryan S. Wood also doesn't have the copies of the original document because it would

631
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,720
be very great to put these kind of through a forensic test as Wood does with the MJ12

632
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,720
documents.

633
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,000
But anyway, guys, again, let me know what you think about the case.

634
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,300
Do you have any other details I glossed over in this because I've really tried to scrounge

635
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,760
as much as I can for any information on this case.

636
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,960
Coming up, guys, a lot of interesting videos, a lot of crash retrievals I'm going to focus

637
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,960
on, a lot of hidden programs.

638
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm going to do a video on the IPU now that I've met with Ryan S. Wood.

639
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:47,880
We are going to do a video on the MJ12 documents, a very kind of comprehensive documentary and

640
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,320
overview of the MJ12 using his expertise.

641
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,600
I also want to make a video solely on the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual I spoke

642
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,960
about in the last video, which Ryan Wood considers to be the most crucial piece of the MJ12 documents.

643
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,400
Besides that, of course, crash retrievals, hopefully some good interviews coming up,

644
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
I hope so.

645
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
We'll see about that.

646
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,680
