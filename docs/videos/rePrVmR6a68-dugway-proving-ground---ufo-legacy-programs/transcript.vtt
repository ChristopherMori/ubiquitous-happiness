00:00.000 --> 00:10.680
Officially designated as the Dugway Proving Ground, this military facility covers an astounding

00:10.680 --> 00:17.200
1,250 square miles of the Great Salt Lake Desert.

00:17.200 --> 00:23.360
Dugway's official mission is to test top-secret weapons and aerospace systems, but UFO researchers

00:23.360 --> 00:30.360
believe the true purpose of Area 52 is even more sinister.

00:54.320 --> 00:59.840
When you imagine UFO legacy program operations focused on the retrieval and exploitation

00:59.840 --> 01:05.040
of technologies of unknown origin, what kind of facilities come to mind?

01:05.040 --> 01:09.600
Is it Area 51, and it's alleged legendary auxiliary site S-4?

01:09.600 --> 01:14.360
Maybe you think of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, and it's possible off-world

01:14.360 --> 01:16.080
technologies division?

01:16.080 --> 01:20.420
Or perhaps you reference China Lake Weapon Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Wright Patterson

01:21.380 --> 01:25.500
Air Force Base, or any number of U.S. Department of Defense installations that are steeped in

01:25.500 --> 01:27.300
UFO lore?

01:27.300 --> 01:33.300
Maybe, just maybe, when imagining UFO legacy program locations, you picture Dugway Proving

01:33.300 --> 01:39.980
Ground, an enormous 1,300 square mile U.S. Army installation nestled between three mountain

01:39.980 --> 01:46.780
ranges in remote Utah that specializes in the testing of biological and chemical weapons.

01:46.780 --> 01:51.900
Even referred to as Area 52, Dugway Proving Ground rose to prominence in the late 90s as

01:51.900 --> 01:57.900
the successor to Area 51's UFO programs due to heavy public exposure on the once-denied

01:57.900 --> 01:59.380
Nevada site.

01:59.380 --> 02:05.180
Ever since, the Utah site and accompanying two premier MRTFBs have been the focus for

02:05.180 --> 02:09.580
deep-six clandestine UAP operations.

02:09.580 --> 02:14.460
But this spotlight doesn't solely focus on the enormous facilities sprawling across the

02:14.460 --> 02:15.660
Utah desert.

02:15.660 --> 02:21.380
Dugway has additionally been accused as the location of a dumb, a deep underground military

02:21.380 --> 02:22.380
base.

02:22.380 --> 02:27.620
Today we shed light on Dugway and discussion of its technologies of unknown origin, exploitation

02:27.620 --> 02:30.460
programs, and subterranean presence.

02:30.460 --> 02:36.780
Through analysis of the facility's intriguing Army and Air Force MRTFBs, study of defense

02:36.780 --> 02:43.060
contractors present on site, and careful evaluation of the witness testimony of one MS, who I

02:43.140 --> 02:48.980
have covered on this channel before, who stumbled upon a craft of likely non-human origin at

02:48.980 --> 02:51.340
the infamous Dugway range.

02:51.340 --> 02:55.820
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we venture into the

02:55.820 --> 03:00.860
world of legacy UFO programs to analyze Dugway Proving Ground.

03:00.860 --> 03:05.660
How deep does the rabbit hole go between the United States' premier biological and chemical

03:05.660 --> 03:09.460
weapons testing facility and non-human technology?

03:09.460 --> 03:15.580
But individuals, military units, and corporations possibly engage with Dugway and UFO reverse

03:15.580 --> 03:19.180
engineering and material exploitation programs.

03:19.180 --> 03:25.100
And does Dugway operate such UFO programs above and below the Earth's surface?

03:25.100 --> 03:32.100
Join me today as we find out.

03:32.620 --> 03:39.060
Dugway Proving Ground is located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Tawilla County, Utah.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.580
The site encompasses over 1,250 square miles and it is larger than the U.S. state of Rhode

03:45.580 --> 03:46.740
Island.

03:46.740 --> 03:52.540
The site itself is ideal for seclusion and privacy free from urban encroachment, light

03:52.540 --> 03:56.820
pollution, and excess acoustic and electronic noise.

03:56.820 --> 04:01.020
Dugway is surrounded by mountains, salt flats, and desert terrain.

04:01.020 --> 04:05.940
These geological features combined with a defense retainer that will apprehend approaching

04:05.940 --> 04:10.140
civilians with armed personnel and black-op helicopters.

04:10.140 --> 04:16.900
Make the Utah Proving Ground perfect for clandestine and classified military test and evaluation.

04:16.900 --> 04:23.100
Dugway was founded in 1942 with the mission to test U.S. and allied chemical and biological

04:23.100 --> 04:29.960
defense systems and perform nuclear, biological, and chemical survivability testing and training

04:29.960 --> 04:35.460
of defense material using chemical and biological agents and stimulants.

04:35.460 --> 04:40.860
The Utah Proving Ground uses its state-of-the-art laboratories and chambers to conduct testing

04:40.860 --> 04:45.300
and training under environmentally controlled conditions.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.580
Dugway's inception arose from the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks which quickly saw the United

04:50.580 --> 04:57.020
States military increase military capabilities in numerous areas including chemical and biological

04:57.020 --> 04:58.180
warfare.

04:58.180 --> 05:03.540
The infamous site has participated in the never-ending global war on terrorism, employing

05:03.540 --> 05:09.100
Special Forces mission rehearsals, classified testing, and biochem urgent need equipment

05:09.100 --> 05:10.100
testing.

05:10.100 --> 05:16.460
Dugway has a laundry list of significant accomplishments including unmanned aerial systems test support,

05:16.460 --> 05:20.780
but we will skip over exploring this entire list of accomplishments.

05:20.780 --> 05:26.740
According to a 2021 U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground Mission and Capabilities Overview public

05:26.740 --> 05:31.540
report, Dugway is a massive contributor to Utah's economy.

05:31.540 --> 05:39.900
Deploying a total of 2,120 employees in residence, 784 of which are primarily Army and Air Force

05:39.900 --> 05:47.100
contractors, 622 of which consist of primary mission and installation contracting command,

05:47.100 --> 05:54.540
think on-site security personnel, and 486 of these military or defense agency civilians.

05:54.540 --> 06:00.740
Dugway or DPG, as we'll refer to it throughout this project, partners with myriad U.S. military,

06:00.740 --> 06:05.260
government, and intelligence agencies including many that harbor our interest throughout this

06:05.260 --> 06:06.260
investigation.

06:06.260 --> 06:14.500
U.S. Army Airborne, Navy, SOCOM, a.k.a. Special Operations Command, the 388th Range Squadron

06:14.500 --> 06:20.660
out of Hill Air Force Base, Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Interior, NASA,

06:20.660 --> 06:22.700
and three universities.

06:22.700 --> 06:28.180
Out of these three universities, I would like to draw specific mention to Utah State University.

06:28.180 --> 06:34.300
U.S.U. employs a university affiliated research center, UARC, for the Missile Defense Agency

06:34.300 --> 06:37.780
known as the Space Dynamics Laboratory.

06:37.780 --> 06:42.820
In numerous projects, I have spoken on UARCs and their similar counterparts Federally Funded

06:42.820 --> 06:45.540
Research and Development Center's FFRDCs.

06:45.540 --> 06:51.700
FFRDCs and UARCs are semi-private, DOD-driven research and development institutions.

06:51.700 --> 06:57.780
I have spoken ad nauseam, our key contributors to UAP legacy programs.

06:57.780 --> 07:04.140
While not the topic of today, UARCs and FFRDCs likely exist as a sort of project manager,

07:04.140 --> 07:08.700
serving as subject matter experts and research and development leaders for joint corporate

07:08.700 --> 07:11.980
and U.S. government UAP programs.

07:11.980 --> 07:18.180
In fact, I believe these two types of institutions to be exponentially more knowledgeable on and

07:18.180 --> 07:24.300
crucial to UFO exploitation programs than most defense contractors through their sole source

07:24.300 --> 07:25.300
contracts.

07:25.300 --> 07:30.820
On this topic for another day, however, FFRDC will come up again throughout this presentation.

07:30.820 --> 07:35.620
For this investigation, we will primarily be focusing on two locations on Dugway known

07:35.620 --> 07:40.940
as MRTFBs, Major Range Test and Facility Bases.

07:40.940 --> 07:46.880
MRTFBs are known as the, quote, core set of DOD test and evaluation infrastructure and

07:46.880 --> 07:52.820
associated workforce that must be preserved as a national asset to provide T&E capabilities

07:52.900 --> 07:56.500
to support the DOD acquisition system, end quote.

07:56.500 --> 08:02.540
The quote unquote critical core of test bases comprise over 10 million acres of land in

08:02.540 --> 08:10.900
the United States, employ over 25,000 people annually and receive over $4 billion in acknowledged

08:10.900 --> 08:12.540
funding annually.

08:12.540 --> 08:19.700
There exists a total of 23 acknowledged MRTFBs, eight Army including Yuma Test Center, Arizona

08:19.700 --> 08:22.300
and White Sands missile range.

08:22.300 --> 08:27.580
Six Navy installations including Naval Air Warfare Center Pax River and China Lake Naval

08:27.580 --> 08:34.420
Warfare Center and seven Air Force Bases including Edwards 412 Test Wing, Nevada Test and Training

08:34.420 --> 08:40.460
Range and the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg and two defense agency bases.

08:40.460 --> 08:45.980
Many here will associate all listed locations with mentions of UFO legacy programs.

08:45.980 --> 08:52.340
I myself have extensively published on witness Ed, who spoke of a joint UFO reverse engineering

08:52.340 --> 08:58.260
operation between the Nevada Test and Training Range and Edwards 412 Test Wing in California.

08:58.260 --> 09:02.380
I strongly recommend viewing this project if you have not already.

09:02.380 --> 09:09.580
Dugway Proving Ground possesses one such MRTFB, the US Army's West Desert Test Center and

09:09.580 --> 09:15.540
also shares the South Range of the Air Force's MRTFB, Utah Test and Training Range with

09:15.540 --> 09:18.100
nearby Hill Air Force Base.

09:18.100 --> 09:23.860
Pay close attention to these two major bases as when we analyze the testimony of MS we

09:23.860 --> 09:30.020
will be exploring a thesis of a joint Army and Air Force legacy program comprised of

09:30.020 --> 09:37.660
the WDTC West Desert Test Center and the UTTR Utah Test and Training Range that extend deep

09:37.660 --> 09:40.100
below the Earth's surface.

09:40.100 --> 09:45.460
And while on the subject of MRTFB's we will dive into much more detail later on including

09:45.460 --> 09:50.540
discussing the Avery Technical Center and shared Michael Army Airfield which I believe

09:50.540 --> 09:55.860
is the operational above ground testing location of this joint UFO project.

09:55.860 --> 10:00.900
But before we venture into Dugway's history with UFO, let's touch on one more thing while

10:00.900 --> 10:04.820
the West Desert Test Center is fresh in your mind.

10:04.820 --> 10:10.260
Investors at WDTC are spearheaded by Army Test and Evaluation Command.

10:10.260 --> 10:16.220
As we begin to implicate Dugway and thus ATEC as engaging in UFO legacy programs I find

10:16.220 --> 10:21.700
the Army Test and Evaluation Organization structure well worth referencing.

10:21.700 --> 10:26.260
Analyzing the reporting structure of ATEC, far up the food chain we can observe the Secretary

10:26.260 --> 10:30.980
of the Army as well as the Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army answering

10:30.980 --> 10:34.620
directly to the US Secretary of Defense.

10:34.620 --> 10:39.260
Those subsets pertain to these four positions including Director of Operational Test and

10:39.260 --> 10:40.740
Evaluation.

10:40.740 --> 10:46.860
But what is interesting here is oversight and TNE policy as well as USA Tech Command

10:46.860 --> 10:53.060
is independent from Conventional Army Research and Development Test and Evaluation structure.

10:53.060 --> 10:58.060
This independence is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Office

10:58.060 --> 11:00.300
of the Secretary of Defense.

11:00.300 --> 11:05.820
This separation exists apparently to ensure warfighter safety through unbiased evaluation

11:05.820 --> 11:11.020
as well as credibility with decision makers, but I can't help but to think here such a

11:11.020 --> 11:17.420
structure could quickly lead to a lack of oversight on ATEC programs and thus a lack of oversight

11:17.420 --> 11:26.540
on West Desert Test Center programs at Dugway Proving Ground.

11:26.540 --> 11:31.580
Let us pause and reflect on historical mentions of Dugway and analyze how and why this site

11:31.580 --> 11:35.140
has often been referred to as Area 52.

11:35.140 --> 11:40.700
Serving as the United States premiered biological and chemical weapons facility, it is no surprise

11:40.700 --> 11:45.940
the secrets of Dugway and its decades of classified operations are held close to the chest of

11:45.940 --> 11:48.380
US military and intelligence.

11:48.380 --> 11:54.940
I would like to briefly discuss a fascinating alleged 1953 UFO crash retrieval case that

11:54.940 --> 12:02.020
occurred less than one month after and solely 200 miles north of the infamous 1953 Kingman,

12:02.020 --> 12:03.460
Arizona crash.

12:03.460 --> 12:09.420
The Garrison, Utah UFO crash retrieval was investigated at length by UFO researcher Steve

12:09.420 --> 12:15.500
Jones and relayed as a moderate confidence case in Ryan S. Woods masterpiece Magic Eyes

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
Only.

12:16.500 --> 12:22.380
Steve Jones was first introduced to the case by a group called the Phoenix Project in 1993.

12:22.380 --> 12:30.140
A group member Al discussed the case with 10-15 large aerial photos dated June of 1953.

12:30.140 --> 12:35.980
These images apparently depicted a large valley with a triangular shaped area on the ground.

12:35.980 --> 12:41.580
A remote station resides alongside the feature called the Desert Range Experimental Station,

12:41.580 --> 12:47.260
or DRES, which is located on the southwest of Dugway's West Desert Test Center extending

12:47.260 --> 12:49.300
from Tuila to Millard County.

12:49.420 --> 12:54.900
DRES is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an arm of the Department of Agriculture.

12:54.900 --> 13:01.700
The Phoenix Project group presented to Jones a DRES logbook dated 1979-1980 that featured

13:01.700 --> 13:08.100
peculiar entries such as USAF and Army personnel from Fort Carson, Colorado, USAF command center

13:08.100 --> 13:11.540
personnel and representatives from a defense contractor.

13:11.540 --> 13:16.140
Phoenix Project believed the DRES to be a front for a secret research facility that

13:16.140 --> 13:21.220
studied a crashed UFO that was buried resulting in the surrounding geology.

13:21.220 --> 13:26.100
During his many visits to the site, Steve Jones was indeed able to track down witnesses

13:26.100 --> 13:29.220
who claimed to see such a crashed object.

13:29.220 --> 13:33.860
Local resident Bart Wright claimed as a child living 8 miles outside of Garrison, he saw

13:33.860 --> 13:39.060
a strange blue light streak across the sky and crash near the side of the valley containing

13:39.060 --> 13:40.060
DRES.

13:40.060 --> 13:44.820
According to Wright, the impact caused the ground to shake and sky to light up.

13:44.820 --> 13:50.620
Steve Jones hired a geologist in 1999 named Lamont Sorensen to conduct magnimeter and

13:50.620 --> 13:55.500
seismic tests on the triangular formation where the craft allegedly crashed.

13:55.500 --> 14:00.780
The geologist found no evidence of underground anomalies but did claim he did not think the

14:00.780 --> 14:02.900
formation was made by nature.

14:02.900 --> 14:08.220
He thought that some kind of artificial digging process did in fact take place.

14:08.220 --> 14:12.780
Whenever a buried UFO is mentioned, this leads to an interesting case but ultimately the

14:12.780 --> 14:15.580
Garrison Utah crash is a dead end.

14:15.580 --> 14:20.140
I would also like to reference the story of the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle

14:20.140 --> 14:24.020
many viewers of this channel will be quite familiar with.

14:24.020 --> 14:28.780
During his decades of investigating into the copy vehicles observed by primary witness

14:28.780 --> 14:34.820
Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, the late Mark McCandlish would

14:34.820 --> 14:40.580
encounter multiple witnesses who had encountered and seen craft similar to the instantly identifiable

14:40.580 --> 14:42.220
Fluxliner.

14:42.220 --> 14:48.900
Of note were two photographs McCandlish obtained possession of from USAF Captain Harvey Williams.

14:48.900 --> 14:56.980
Williams photographed this disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah.

14:56.980 --> 15:02.300
The object bears striking resemblance to the Fluxliner and possibly details an intriguing

15:02.300 --> 15:08.900
evolution in imaging technology from 1967 to Brad's observation in 1988.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.020
Let me explain.

15:10.020 --> 15:16.060
Brad and McCandlish claim the ARV flew via a synthetic vision system overlapping cameras

15:16.060 --> 15:21.860
that allowed for a pilot inside the craft to access full 3D view when operating the craft.

15:21.860 --> 15:27.940
The cameras were housed in protective acrylic bubbles almost appearing as off-the-shelf components.

15:27.940 --> 15:34.200
Due to cameras being much larger in 1967, if the USAF Captain did indeed photograph an

15:34.200 --> 15:39.760
early model of the Fluxliner, this would feature a larger synthetic vision system to accommodate

15:39.760 --> 15:41.880
larger camera technology.

15:41.880 --> 15:47.280
But I am equally, if not more, interested in the location of this sighting at a low altitude

15:47.280 --> 15:49.280
of 12,000 feet.

15:49.280 --> 15:56.480
Provo, Utah is only 100 miles from Dugway and less than 75 miles from Hill Air Force Base.

15:56.480 --> 16:01.260
Remember what we discussed earlier, Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share runways such

16:01.260 --> 16:06.780
as the Dugway-Michael Army Airfield and operate together in the Utah Test and Training Range

16:06.780 --> 16:08.520
Southern Area.

16:08.520 --> 16:14.300
Also recall the numerous mentions of MRTFBs and how two such critical cores reside on

16:14.300 --> 16:15.300
Dugway.

16:15.300 --> 16:20.140
I would once again like to reference witness Ed and the Joint Reverse Engineering Program

16:20.140 --> 16:25.100
between the Edwards 412th Test Wing and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

16:25.100 --> 16:31.620
Both the 412th and NTTR are Air Force MRTFBs just as the UTTR is.

16:31.620 --> 16:39.180
The testimony of Ed explores two MRTFBs working in conjunction to test reverse engineered vehicles.

16:39.180 --> 16:45.780
USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet stated the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle saw operations

16:45.780 --> 16:51.340
at Area 51 which is part of the NTTR and pilots inside the triangle were pulled from

16:51.340 --> 16:55.440
Edwards Air Force Test Pilot School, part of the 412th.

16:55.440 --> 17:00.300
The Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicles were allegedly shown at Norton Air Force Base

17:00.300 --> 17:06.740
in 1988, which is with an extreme proximity to the fabled USAF Plant 42 and Edwards Air

17:06.740 --> 17:07.980
Force Base.

17:07.980 --> 17:12.900
If Harvey Williams did indeed image early iterations of the Fluxliner, this would imply

17:12.900 --> 17:18.980
a UFO reverse engineering and ARV testing program between two MRTFBs.

17:18.980 --> 17:22.600
Utah Test and Training Range and Edwards 412th Test Wing.

17:22.600 --> 17:27.380
This is incredibly similar to the claims of Ed and Fouchet.

17:27.380 --> 17:32.420
Further in this exploration, we will investigate a possible UFO legacy program operating across

17:32.420 --> 17:37.940
both Army and Air Force MRTFBs at Dugway, but we will save this for later.

17:37.940 --> 17:44.060
In June of 1997, Popular Mechanics Magazine published a stunning monthly issue.

17:44.060 --> 17:50.260
The titular article titled The New Area 51 discussed the Air Force abandoning its once

17:50.260 --> 17:56.020
most secretive site for top secret testing and moved to a new, more private location.

17:56.020 --> 18:01.260
Let's, of course, dive into this intriguing article to discover the quote-unquote New

18:01.260 --> 18:05.180
Area 51 and its secret airbase operations.

18:05.180 --> 18:08.480
Right off the jump, the images in this piece are fascinating.

18:08.480 --> 18:14.720
We see a sticky note that says, Call Admiral Inman at Science Applications International.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.900
Now I know this isn't the subject of the video, but for an article that mocks the idea

18:18.900 --> 18:23.840
of UFO reverse engineering programs by claiming those who believe the X-Files and existence

18:23.840 --> 18:28.920
of a Dress Collection by former FBI Director Edgar Hoover are the type of people to believe

18:28.920 --> 18:33.880
in UFO crash retrievals, why is Bobby Ray Inman mentioned?

18:33.880 --> 18:39.520
Members of this channel may recall recent mention of Inman in the Northrop Grumman Project.

18:39.520 --> 18:45.240
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former NSA Director, CIA Deputy Director, and Science Applications

18:45.240 --> 18:52.280
International Corporation SAIC Board Member, once discussed UFO recovered vehicles to NASA

18:52.280 --> 18:54.800
mission specialist Bob Eschler.

18:54.800 --> 19:01.320
Inman also referred Eschler to retired Rear Admiral and BDM Board Member Sumner Shapiro,

19:01.320 --> 19:06.840
who informed Eschler, UAP retrievals would see teams take apart craft, pack them up,

19:06.840 --> 19:09.920
and ship them around the country to different laboratories.

19:09.920 --> 19:15.840
Inman is an integral figure in the discussion of UFO crash retrievals in the 1980s.

19:15.840 --> 19:21.040
And I do not need to go into SAIC and their likely involvement in an off-world technologies

19:21.040 --> 19:23.580
division at NSWC Crane.

19:23.580 --> 19:28.880
This tiny sticky note in a rather deprecating article is incredibly interesting.

19:28.880 --> 19:34.080
The popular mechanics piece states due to overexposure as America's worst kept secret

19:34.080 --> 19:36.440
Area 51 shut down.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.440
This is of course objectively false, however.

19:39.440 --> 19:44.200
Later individuals we will discuss in this project reference a percentage of up to 40%

19:44.200 --> 19:48.440
of Area 51's clandestine operations moving to Dugway.

19:48.440 --> 19:53.320
One primary reason for the move out of Area 51 according to the popular mechanics author

19:53.320 --> 19:58.320
Jim Wilson was the need for a different type of proving ground for ultra high performance

19:58.320 --> 20:00.240
military aircraft.

20:00.240 --> 20:04.240
After some impressive sleuthing including referencing Air Force Base Command General

20:04.240 --> 20:10.320
Howell Estes and NASA Administrator Daniel Golden's 1997 agreement to share quote unquote

20:10.320 --> 20:17.480
redundant assets, as well as a 1996 NASA announcement stating Michael Army Airfield would share

20:17.480 --> 20:23.480
as a runway for several X-33 missions popular mechanics narrowed in on Utah.

20:23.480 --> 20:29.400
In a quick side note, the X-33 aircraft capable of Mach 15 was a Lockheed Martin Skunkworks

20:29.400 --> 20:33.200
production formed out of the Palmdale facility.

20:33.200 --> 20:38.360
Both Michael Army Airfield which shits nestled on Dugway's West Desert Test Center within

20:38.360 --> 20:42.360
the Avery Technical Center and don't worry much more on this later.

20:42.360 --> 20:47.680
As well as Green River Utah Launch Complex part of White Sands missile range were ideal

20:47.680 --> 20:51.160
installations for the new Area 51.

20:51.160 --> 20:55.920
Michael Army Airfield possessed an equally if not more deterring surrounding area than

20:55.920 --> 20:57.480
Area 51.

20:57.480 --> 21:02.960
Not only is the airfield situated on 1300 square miles of Dugway ranges but it is also

21:02.960 --> 21:06.600
bordered by numerous mountain ranges and salt flats.

21:06.600 --> 21:11.440
The airfield did however lack adequate landing runways according to popular mechanics which

21:11.440 --> 21:18.400
is why Utah Launch Complex situated only 200 miles away served as the ideal dance partner

21:18.400 --> 21:20.560
for the Michael Army Airfield.

21:20.560 --> 21:25.760
The magazine attempted flyovers of the airfield to snap images of the surrounding area but

21:25.760 --> 21:28.240
were warned of being shot down.

21:28.240 --> 21:33.760
Additionally, the magazine attempted to purchase satellite imagery of the Utah Launch Complex

21:33.760 --> 21:37.520
but was denied due to security reasons.

21:37.520 --> 21:44.400
The claims of a new Area 51 are not isolated to mainstream publishers like popular mechanics.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.200
Let's revisit the testimony of Edgar Fouchet in the TR-3B.

21:48.200 --> 21:53.000
Like I said in the Northrop Project, many are critical of Fouchet due to his claims of

21:53.000 --> 21:58.120
a reverse-engineered triangular alien reproduction vehicle with little in the way of physical

21:58.120 --> 21:59.120
proof.

21:59.120 --> 22:04.960
However, his disclosures have led to incredibly actionable intelligence and worthwhile investigation.

22:04.960 --> 22:12.240
In his 1998 IUFOC, International UFO Congress Presentation, Fouchet presented comprehensive

22:12.240 --> 22:19.960
disclosures of TR-3B, Area 51, NSA's Men in Black Treat, EG&G, and Project Red Light,

22:19.960 --> 22:23.960
as well as the DARCE Defense Advanced Research Center which I have talked about numerous

22:23.960 --> 22:25.520
times on this channel.

22:25.520 --> 22:30.680
In the presentation, Fouchet made mention to a source informing him beginning in 1992

22:30.680 --> 22:36.480
the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to massive public attention on Area 51.

22:36.480 --> 22:42.120
This would see the majority of exotic Air Force platforms relocated to Utah, Colorado,

22:42.120 --> 22:47.240
Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia, and south of Area 51 to S-4.

22:47.240 --> 22:53.360
And there is evidence to show a heavy focus on Area 51 and UFO programs in the early 1990s

22:53.360 --> 22:58.040
which may in fact have seen projects moved out of Area 51 Groom Lake.

22:58.040 --> 23:03.780
In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least 8 black programs

23:03.780 --> 23:09.420
flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional

23:09.420 --> 23:10.820
technologies.

23:10.820 --> 23:15.340
An unnamed source Goodall knew for 12 years stationed at Groom Lake later explained that

23:15.340 --> 23:21.540
UAP positively existed at the base while another source stated, quote, we have things out there

23:21.540 --> 23:26.260
that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in

23:26.260 --> 23:28.060
the movies, end quote.

23:28.060 --> 23:34.220
Programs of Area 51 moving clandestine operations to Dugway were additionally made by one A.H.

23:34.220 --> 23:39.740
A.H claimed to be a former Boeing employee who leveraged significant knowledge on UFO

23:39.740 --> 23:47.020
legacy programs from friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, ONI, NRO, Area 51, the Air Force

23:47.020 --> 23:49.500
Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and others.

23:49.500 --> 23:55.100
A.H appeared as a primary witness on Stephen Greer's 2001 excellent disclosure briefing

23:55.100 --> 23:59.120
document and had his testimony taped in the year 2000.

23:59.120 --> 24:04.260
Now it's worth noting as I discussed in the Northrop project, A.H is likely a primary

24:04.260 --> 24:10.380
source of information for Dr. Stephen Greer, similar to UFO researcher William Hamilton.

24:10.380 --> 24:16.940
As A.H has been in contact with Greer for decades, and Greer repeats much of what A.H has stated

24:16.940 --> 24:18.440
in the past.

24:18.440 --> 24:24.540
Greer talks often of Dugway as a primary UFO legacy program site, discussing a Utah underground

24:24.540 --> 24:29.780
complex south of Salt Lake City accessible only by air in the 2001 disclosure briefing

24:29.780 --> 24:33.220
document and again in a 2016 presentation.

24:33.220 --> 24:37.900
In this 26 presentation, Greer discussed Black program locations and codenames which

24:37.900 --> 24:40.260
relate to the testimony of Ed.

24:40.260 --> 24:46.260
In this discussion, Greer tags Dugway as quote, the most critical one, end quote, when discussing

24:46.260 --> 24:48.100
Black program facilities.

24:49.020 --> 24:53.500
And in Utah, one of the most critical, and this is the most critical one that's new,

24:53.500 --> 24:59.900
is the Dugway proving grounds outside of Provo, and this is classified air space above and

24:59.900 --> 25:02.220
no access by ground.

25:02.220 --> 25:06.500
Above ground, you don't see much and everything is underground.

25:06.500 --> 25:12.300
Richard Foch, this Naval Research Labs official, was out there with some generation five or

25:12.300 --> 25:15.940
six or whatever night scopes doing an operation.

25:15.940 --> 25:20.780
When he looked out and he saw these objects coming out from underground that then zipped

25:20.780 --> 25:26.380
over and that were these massive disk and triangular shape anti-gravity objects that

25:26.380 --> 25:27.380
were ours.

25:27.380 --> 25:30.140
And some were just sitting out there watching him.

25:30.140 --> 25:33.380
And that's outside of Provo out in the desert.

25:33.380 --> 25:38.780
It is not inconceivable many of Greer's early ideas on Dugway were disclosed to him by witness

25:38.780 --> 25:39.980
A.H.

25:40.020 --> 25:46.180
After all, in 2000, A.H. did in fact reference an underground Utah installation southwest

25:46.180 --> 25:52.180
of Salt Lake City accessible only by air that tests and maintains extraterrestrial technology.

25:52.180 --> 25:58.540
We're incorporating this technology from this craft that the Area 51 and I also found out

25:58.540 --> 26:05.500
that they are moving a lot of the personnel and some of the equipment and some of the

26:05.500 --> 26:14.020
extraterrestrial technology equipment and the craft to base up in Utah.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.020
Is it right?

26:15.020 --> 26:23.020
And they move very 50 most stuff from Area 51 at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.

26:23.020 --> 26:29.260
However, we can find some extremely interesting pre 2000s discussion of Dugway by Greer.

26:29.260 --> 26:35.620
See on screen now a March 1998 email exchange with Greer and UFO investigator Steve Jones.

26:35.620 --> 26:42.820
Yes, the same investigator we discussed above with the alleged 1953 Garrison Utah UFO crash.

26:42.820 --> 26:47.460
In these initial exchanges, Jones details his field notes while near the Desert Range

26:47.460 --> 26:51.020
experimental station studying the retrieval case.

26:51.020 --> 26:55.420
Jones mentioned he had learned that work from Area 51 Groom Lake had indeed been moved to

26:55.420 --> 26:59.900
Dugway in an area called Dog west of the main gate.

26:59.900 --> 27:04.820
Jones himself had collected data since the 1980s on tarped trucks left in the middle

27:04.820 --> 27:06.660
of nowhere in Utah.

27:06.660 --> 27:11.540
These truckloads were left between Hill Air Force Base north of Salt Lake and Wendover

27:11.540 --> 27:13.820
Utah bordering Nevada.

27:13.820 --> 27:19.540
This between area is of course Dugway and the Utah test and training range.

27:19.540 --> 27:24.780
Recall also that Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share air strips in the UTTR.

27:24.780 --> 27:30.980
Hill itself and its 388th range squadron operate on the Dugway-Michael Army airfield.

27:30.980 --> 27:37.660
What is more intriguing to me is an even earlier 1996 exchange of emails between Greer and

27:37.660 --> 27:45.740
one AJ Kradock with the subject line quote, Area 51, insiders say area southwest of Tawilla,

27:45.740 --> 27:52.780
Utah deserve a look and quote, AJ aka Tony Kradock once did work with Greer serving as

27:52.780 --> 27:55.860
webmaster for csetty.org.

27:55.860 --> 28:02.700
Kradock is also the founder and CEO of Kradock, an oil and gas service provider in Libya.

28:02.700 --> 28:08.540
Why did a CEO with 40 years experience in the international petroleum industry engage

28:08.540 --> 28:11.740
in UFO research with Greer in the 90s?

28:11.740 --> 28:16.540
Anyways, in this email address to Greer, Kradock links a discussion with an insider

28:16.540 --> 28:17.740
source.

28:17.740 --> 28:22.940
The sender or insider had their credentials withheld but claimed to work on several sites,

28:22.940 --> 28:27.460
checking badges and running ground surveillance equipment, tremor sensors, ground surveillance

28:27.460 --> 28:29.100
radar, etc.

28:29.100 --> 28:35.540
The source additionally discussed EMP weaponry that could fry vehicle computers or electronics.

28:35.540 --> 28:40.380
We live in a world where EMP devices are often discussed as legacy program weapons to shoot

28:40.380 --> 28:44.200
down non-human craft, so this inclusion is interesting.

28:44.200 --> 28:49.480
The source claims Kradock and others, implying Greer, were looking in two obvious directions

28:49.480 --> 28:51.560
for UAP programs.

28:51.560 --> 28:56.800
Although Area 51 did indeed have legacy programs, the source advised Kradock to look in the

28:56.800 --> 29:02.200
state of Utah to the southwest of Tawilla County and west of Salt Lake City.

29:02.200 --> 29:07.440
In this described area existed nine exclusion zones, four of which featured underground

29:07.440 --> 29:12.080
locations and this area, of course, is dugway-proving ground.

29:12.080 --> 29:16.640
The Kradock-Greer connection here is fascinating and well worth exploring more.

29:16.640 --> 29:22.320
However, remember this discussion of dugway, Area 51, and mysterious programs took place

29:22.320 --> 29:29.600
before the 1997 Popular Mechanics article on the new Area 51, Fuchet's Disclosures,

29:29.600 --> 29:32.160
and A.H.'s film testimony.

29:32.160 --> 29:36.760
Very pertinent, this insider source claimed to have knowledge of dugway-proving ground

29:36.760 --> 29:45.840
and UFO legacy programs before any public exposure.

29:45.840 --> 29:51.280
In June of 2023, the contentious Stephen Greer held his first whistleblower symposium at

29:51.280 --> 29:54.580
the National Press Club since his 2001 panel.

29:54.580 --> 29:59.600
That featured the legendary Mark McCandillish amongst other first-hand witnesses.

29:59.600 --> 30:04.280
Viewers may remember this panel as featuring the first public disclosures of Michael Herrera,

30:04.280 --> 30:08.520
and we now know UFO whistleblower Jake Barber was in attendance.

30:08.520 --> 30:13.940
One witness featured was not present at the event and had his story told by Greer.

30:13.940 --> 30:17.160
This was a witness known by the pseudonym MS.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.680
So there's another gentleman.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.240
I'm going to run through these very quickly.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
We'd be here for 30 hours if I didn't.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.520
I'm just giving you a tip of the iceberg, right?

30:25.520 --> 30:31.600
This is a guy who is at the dugway-proving grounds for a key facility, MS, we call him.

30:31.600 --> 30:38.960
He was a work for C. Martin Corporation contractor, and he was in a facility that had an extraterrestrial

30:38.960 --> 30:42.040
vehicle that was being studied by scientists.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.240
He knows the chief scientist involved.

30:44.240 --> 30:49.040
He has named that individual to us, and they can all be subpoenaed now.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.520
So this object was there in 2009.

30:52.520 --> 30:57.280
He didn't know the date of acquisition, but he thought it was fairly recent.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.280
Next.

30:58.280 --> 31:04.000
He also was read into and had the chief scientist show him the location which we now have of

31:04.000 --> 31:10.720
a dumb, deep underground military base that is in the dugway sector, so-called Avery Sector

31:10.720 --> 31:15.400
A-V-E-R-Y, and it has huge capacity for parking.

31:15.400 --> 31:20.440
You go in and there's a vast underground complex in that location.

31:20.440 --> 31:24.560
That location has been handed off to investigators with the U.S. government.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.720
Next.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.920
This gives an illustration of the size of this.

31:27.920 --> 31:32.040
You could put easily on the platform that goes down the Air Force One.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.800
It's a very large elevator goes down underground.

31:35.800 --> 31:42.320
Upon release of the DPI archive, I investigated all files relating to this fascinating case.

31:42.320 --> 31:47.120
Files on MS can be found under witness ID 10655.

31:47.120 --> 31:52.320
Due to lapses in site security and data presented in the documents, I was able to track down

31:52.320 --> 31:57.280
witness MS and hear his incredible encounter at Dugway firsthand.

31:57.280 --> 32:02.920
Investors of my channel may recall an interview with MS in UFO Witness' redacted list.

32:02.920 --> 32:07.800
This project was deleted to respect the privacy of other witnesses covered in the project,

32:07.800 --> 32:08.800
however.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.320
I would now like to revisit the testimony of MS with exponentially greater focus on his

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
claims.

32:14.320 --> 32:19.040
The purpose of this investigation will be to identify specific buildings and military

32:19.040 --> 32:24.560
units operating UFO legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground as well as explore any and

32:24.560 --> 32:29.760
all evidence to the enormous facility likely beneath the ground of the Utah site.

32:29.760 --> 32:34.120
And before we get started, I would like to add MS was approached by elements of the Senate

32:34.120 --> 32:39.040
Select Committee on Intelligence to testify regarding his claims and I can confirm this

32:39.040 --> 32:42.080
as he shared with me the screenshots of their outreach.

32:42.080 --> 32:47.200
MS turned down the requests as he is a current railroad employee and was unable to break

32:47.200 --> 32:52.280
away from work for a week plus even when SSCI offered to pay for his travel.

32:52.320 --> 32:57.880
I have a tremendous amount of respect for MS and find great value in researching his

32:57.880 --> 32:59.280
testimony.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.600
Witness MS served in the U.S. Navy and was even stationed in the auxiliary division

33:03.600 --> 33:08.120
of the USS Teddy Roosevelt from 1990 to 2000.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.840
Following his service, MS entered into government contracting work.

33:11.840 --> 33:17.800
From 2009 to 2013, he worked as a maintenance painter and sign technician for the C. Martin

33:17.800 --> 33:18.800
Company.

33:18.800 --> 33:23.640
C. Martin is a DOD contractor whose mission is to, quote, provide a fine-tuned approach

33:23.640 --> 33:28.720
to managing people, time and resources to provide quality services while creating value

33:28.720 --> 33:30.640
for our customers, end quote.

33:30.640 --> 33:36.160
C. Martin operates as a prime subcontractor with DOD in myriad capacities, specializing

33:36.160 --> 33:41.560
in facility operations and maintenance, logistics, construction, range operation and maintenance,

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
etc.

33:42.560 --> 33:47.280
And C. Martin does indeed have a location on Dugway located near the administration

33:47.280 --> 33:48.280
center.

33:48.280 --> 33:52.960
C. Martin's range and facility, operations and maintenance contracting pertains greatly

33:52.960 --> 33:58.440
to areas of interest for this investigation, specifically for Avery Technical Center, which

33:58.440 --> 34:03.800
resides on Michael Army Airfield shared with Hill Air Force Base in the 388th Range Squadron

34:03.800 --> 34:08.360
as well as locations a stone throw away called Ditto Technical Center.

34:08.360 --> 34:13.720
Ditto contains the heart of the West Desert Test Center, which alongside ATEC tests chemicals

34:13.720 --> 34:17.360
and biological weapons across the Utah range.

34:17.360 --> 34:22.680
In fact, the Army Test and Evaluation Command Major Range and Facility Base West Desert

34:22.680 --> 34:28.160
Test Center is majorly funded by the Joint Services Chemical and Biological Defense Program

34:28.160 --> 34:35.360
CBDP, a lot of acronyms I know, but remember the term CBDP as we will discuss it again

34:35.360 --> 34:41.160
both in relation to a specific contractor of interest at Dugway and for MS's story.

34:41.160 --> 34:47.040
Now MS's experience begins in 2009, four months into his work for C. Martin at Dugway.

34:47.040 --> 34:52.840
MS held a level 5 proximity badge, which allowed him access to myriad facilities across Dugway

34:52.840 --> 34:55.640
to perform DOD contractor work.

34:55.640 --> 35:00.720
And crucial to note, MS did not have a security clearance even though he occasionally states

35:00.720 --> 35:03.480
level 5 clearance instead of badge.

35:03.480 --> 35:09.160
MS would often ride into Dugway Proving Ground from Caysville, Utah in a van where all other

35:09.160 --> 35:12.200
travelers held top secret clearance.

35:12.200 --> 35:17.080
On normal day on the job, MS was tasked with electrical meter reading to allow the U.S.

35:17.080 --> 35:21.000
government to bill various contractors working on site.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.920
In 2009 is when it happened, I was about four months into working there.

35:27.920 --> 35:33.040
There was a kid that was underneath me as my apprentice because I was one of the maintenance

35:33.040 --> 35:34.040
painters.

35:34.040 --> 35:40.920
We took care of every facility out there and so he called in sick one day.

35:40.920 --> 35:45.200
I had to go read beaders for him because that's what they do.

35:45.200 --> 35:54.440
So the government is in control of about 48% of that and then 52% of it is private contractor

35:54.440 --> 35:56.920
and that's why they don't have to disclose anything.

35:56.920 --> 36:03.520
So I had to go out read his meter that day to get everything turned in to the government

36:03.520 --> 36:06.560
and I can't remember how many facilities there were.

36:06.560 --> 36:15.520
Probably a good 15 but those 15 took me to places where I've never really been out there

36:15.520 --> 36:22.000
and opened my eyes up to a lot of different things.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.840
This led MS to the Avery Technical Center where he entered into the quote unquote ghost building,

36:27.840 --> 36:31.560
a building nicknamed for having no numbers and no insignia.

36:31.560 --> 36:36.680
Initially, I believed these facilities may be the material test facility or defensive

36:36.680 --> 36:41.800
test chamber just south of Avery across the road from Ditto Technical Center.

36:41.800 --> 36:47.360
After all, MS will soon describe the incident location as a clean room of sorts and these

36:47.360 --> 36:54.080
two facilities are high profile CBDP test areas on site at the West Desert Test Center.

36:54.080 --> 36:58.920
However, these installations are well known and indeed named and numbered.

36:58.920 --> 37:04.360
On the other hand, Avery Technical Center yields very few search results and quite often

37:04.360 --> 37:08.720
does not appear in numerous U.S. Army and ATEC documents.

37:08.720 --> 37:14.280
In fact, Avery is curiously missing from DPG visitor guides while other areas of interest

37:14.280 --> 37:17.080
such as Ditto are clearly mentioned.

37:17.080 --> 37:21.960
Last time I covered MS's testimony, I had very little to work off regarding Avery,

37:21.960 --> 37:28.840
bar a September 2017 DTTF facility description document and image from Facebook.

37:28.840 --> 37:35.400
Before we investigate Avery, I must clearly state I am not revealing any classified information.

37:35.400 --> 37:41.120
All locations and installations to be discussed can be referenced in public domain materials.

37:41.120 --> 37:46.760
Let's reference a July 2012 unclassified report titled Environmental Assessment of

37:46.760 --> 37:52.000
the Continued Exclusive Use of Department of the Army Land Located at U.S. Army Dugway

37:52.000 --> 37:58.120
Proving Ground by members of the U.S. Air Force that offers incredible insights and exploration

37:58.120 --> 38:00.040
into Avery Technical Center.

38:00.040 --> 38:05.120
As mentioned numerous times so far, Avery borders Michael Army airfield and both the

38:05.120 --> 38:11.440
airfield and 40 acre Avery area are the focus of the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby

38:11.440 --> 38:13.520
Hill Air Force Base.

38:13.520 --> 38:18.120
Avery partly serves as air testing slash training for the 388th.

38:18.120 --> 38:23.120
Historically, Avery had conducted numerous radiological studies and investigations into

38:23.120 --> 38:28.760
the handling of radioactive material, including utilizing the Radiobiological Warfare Laboratories

38:28.760 --> 38:31.080
for the Atomic Energy Commission.

38:31.080 --> 38:37.080
Avery employs an internal rail system for the transportation of radioactive materials.

38:37.080 --> 38:42.280
This mention of an internal rail system is truly massive as we further on investigate

38:42.280 --> 38:46.000
Dugway's alleged deep underground military base.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.200
Aerial views of Avery yield no building descriptions unlike the nearby Ditto area where facilities

38:51.200 --> 38:55.080
like the Diner, Contractor Jacobs, etc. are mentioned.

38:55.080 --> 39:00.200
However, this Environmental Assessment document offers us a gorgeous detailed overview of

39:00.200 --> 39:03.520
Avery locations see on screen now.

39:03.520 --> 39:09.320
Locations of interest include the 10-02 Avery Tunnel Entrance, 10-12 Photo Operations and

39:09.320 --> 39:14.920
Maintenance, 10-38 General Storage, and 10-16 Classified Storage.

39:14.920 --> 39:20.680
Now other buildings outside of this map not marked developed slash unclassified exist.

39:20.680 --> 39:27.400
However, I am willing to bet this experience took place at Building 10-10 Test Operations.

39:27.400 --> 39:32.360
But enough investigation, let's hear from MS as he entered this ghost building.

39:32.800 --> 39:37.400
I walked into one that they called the ghost building because it just kind of came out

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
of nowhere.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.880
No numbers on it, no nothing.

39:40.880 --> 39:47.920
And opened up the door and basically had a M16 stuck in my chest and I had my level

39:47.920 --> 39:48.920
5 badge on.

39:48.920 --> 39:53.880
I think that was the only thing that saved my tail that day.

39:53.880 --> 40:00.160
And there were what I call white coats, you know, they're kind of like doctors type set

40:00.200 --> 40:05.960
up inside the building, kind of like a little clean room area.

40:05.960 --> 40:10.560
And you know, I'm sure I don't know if you've ever been in a car accident or not, but when

40:10.560 --> 40:17.320
you you have your life kind of flashed before your eyes, everything starts to slow down

40:17.320 --> 40:22.560
and you start really taking in a lot of information very quickly.

40:22.560 --> 40:28.040
And so that's that's what I, you know, what happened to me is with with the gun and everything

40:28.040 --> 40:34.760
else that just kind of everything just started started to fall into place.

40:34.760 --> 40:41.320
That thing was on its own power when I hovered, there was there's kind of a I don't know

40:41.320 --> 40:49.600
if you've seen the rendering or not, yes, the door, there was no door just kind of open

40:49.600 --> 40:56.480
on the bottom, but everything is just kind of just walking there on its own power.

40:56.480 --> 41:03.520
I don't always know anything, but the white coats walk around and analyze and do all their

41:03.520 --> 41:04.520
stuff.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.520
I don't know.

41:05.520 --> 41:12.720
There's, you know, a few gift armed guards in there at the time and I like I said, I don't

41:12.720 --> 41:18.840
know if they were getting ready to move or, you know, what have you quickly before we

41:18.840 --> 41:24.360
discussed this incredible craft, who were these armed guards that held MS at gunpoint?

41:24.360 --> 41:30.040
While numerous US facilities actually contract security personnel instead of enlisted men,

41:30.040 --> 41:32.360
this is done through sole source contracts.

41:32.360 --> 41:38.200
A contract method Dr. Eric Davis has stated is used for UAP legacy programs.

41:38.200 --> 41:43.520
These contracts were given to private security companies post 9 11 to bolster US Army and

41:43.520 --> 41:46.040
other military installation security.

41:46.040 --> 41:51.480
I have found a 2006 General Accounting Office report titled, quote, Army's Guard program

41:51.480 --> 41:56.360
requires greater oversight and reassessment of acquisition approach, end quote.

41:56.360 --> 42:00.960
This document discusses all contracted security personnel issued by the Army.

42:00.960 --> 42:05.040
Dugway Proving Ground utilize Chenega integrated systems.

42:05.040 --> 42:10.280
In future projects, I will be interested in exploring both Chenega and their subcontractor,

42:10.280 --> 42:12.960
Vance Federal Security Services.

42:12.960 --> 42:17.680
Wackenhut Services, which Admiral Bobby Ray Inman was formerly a board member of, is a

42:17.680 --> 42:23.960
private security corporation I highly suspect was involved in UAP legacy program security.

42:23.960 --> 42:29.680
Wackenhut, like Vance Federal Security Systems, were used as subcontractors to Army installation,

42:29.680 --> 42:31.800
not primary contractors.

42:31.800 --> 42:36.360
Now, unless contractor security personnel were highly cleared security specialists,

42:36.360 --> 42:41.040
I highly doubt these private security companies could do more than scan vehicles and check

42:41.040 --> 42:44.200
badges for access to legacy program sites.

42:44.320 --> 42:49.720
Therefore, while I do reckon security services like Wackenhut and possibly Chenega have historically

42:49.720 --> 42:55.880
performed installation and access security for UAP legacy program locations, I must conclude

42:55.880 --> 43:02.840
the armed guards within proximity to the saucer were known as industrial security, Indusec personnel.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.240
Now, why that conclusion?

43:05.240 --> 43:08.920
Industrial security, quote, conducts risk management activities with respect to the

43:08.920 --> 43:14.160
US government's defense industrial base, including critical technologies and the defense

43:14.160 --> 43:19.680
supply chain through oversight of the national industrial security program, issuance of facility

43:19.680 --> 43:25.160
security clearances, foreign ownership control and influence mitigation measures, information

43:25.160 --> 43:30.160
system cyber security oversight and other activities related to protecting classified

43:30.160 --> 43:35.920
and controlled unclassified national security information and related technology, end quote.

43:35.920 --> 43:42.840
See on screen now an ATEC security specialist role for Dugway detailing an Indusec position.

43:42.840 --> 43:46.920
These responsibilities are listed for this role, including one such task, which is to

43:46.920 --> 43:52.680
provide backup as the alternate special security officer for sensitive compartmented information

43:52.680 --> 43:54.600
SEI programs.

43:54.600 --> 44:00.240
Moving forward, investigating industrial security alongside UAP legacy program installations

44:00.240 --> 44:02.520
will be paramount to my research.

44:02.520 --> 44:08.840
Anyways, MS observed a saucer, roughly 10 feet tall and 20 feet in circumference.

44:08.840 --> 44:12.360
The craft was hovering 10 to 12 inches off the ground.

44:12.360 --> 44:17.680
The disc had no seams or fasteners and appeared to be made out of one piece and featured a

44:17.680 --> 44:20.000
brushed metal appearance.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.520
Around the craft were six lab technicians.

44:22.520 --> 44:28.840
I believe these to be ATEC and Battelle Memorial Institute scientists, and more on this later.

44:28.840 --> 44:33.200
MS believed this craft was in the process of being dismantled due to a bottom section

44:33.200 --> 44:37.160
of the saucer being removed featuring a conical structure.

44:37.160 --> 44:42.360
This conical section appeared to be floating and was almost independent of the craft.

44:42.360 --> 44:47.680
One cannot help but draw parallels to Bob Lazar's drawn extraterrestrial reactor model

44:47.680 --> 44:53.000
that he claimed served as the propulsion mechanism for the sports model flying saucer.

44:53.000 --> 44:59.240
Appearing by the craft was a flat screen television type of electronic, displaying a mapping system.

45:00.240 --> 45:06.120
Yeah, there is nothing on it, not a seam, not anything almost like it was like just casted.

45:06.120 --> 45:11.400
Yeah, like if you said it 3D printed, but yeah, it's flawless is what I can say.

45:11.400 --> 45:18.600
It's not that you, like nowadays, there's no way to replicate it for us.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.720
I don't know if they were going to get ready to move it or whatever, but they had it broke down.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.000
A lot of it was broke down.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.320
That bottom section was open where you could kind of see into that component area.

45:30.320 --> 45:37.360
That triangle, it's like it's floating, like it's generating a power.

45:37.360 --> 45:46.520
I don't know, like a lot of everything happened very, very quickly and just trying to take in everything as fast as I could.

45:46.520 --> 45:51.840
That section is basically doing its own thing.

45:51.880 --> 45:59.760
When I stand in, I don't know if you're careless with something or just, that's what I said.

45:59.760 --> 46:07.400
Is it in transition to where it's like, you guys have it out in this building out in the middle of nowhere,

46:07.400 --> 46:12.920
but then you have military vehicles around, you have regular civilian vehicles around,

46:12.920 --> 46:18.440
but if this thing's on its own power doing its own thing, what are you guys going to be doing with it?

46:18.440 --> 46:24.840
You guys going to move it underground, more stuff going on, or if you've taken what you wanted.

46:24.840 --> 46:30.040
MS was taken by the guards to the nearby Ditto Technical Center to the Garrison building

46:30.040 --> 46:34.240
where two men in civilian clothing immediately began interrogating him.

46:34.240 --> 46:40.120
The men were clad in black suits and MS guessed these individuals to be FBI or CIA.

46:40.120 --> 46:46.080
Quite possibly, these men could also be the infamous alleged NSA men in black treat.

46:46.160 --> 46:49.720
For six hours, MS was harassed and interrogated.

46:49.720 --> 46:55.560
The entire duration MS maintained he had no idea what he saw and he was just doing his job.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.480
Eventually, he was let go.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.360
I didn't say a word of these guys when they sat me down.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.080
So I don't know if they knew that I saw something.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.880
I don't know how they, you know what I mean?

47:04.880 --> 47:09.760
But we, I still worked out there, so I still had a confidential agreement with them.

47:09.760 --> 47:13.520
I still had all that, but I don't know where it would stand nowadays.

47:13.600 --> 47:18.000
In the months and years following the incident, MS would discuss his encounter with family

47:18.000 --> 47:21.120
and friends and ask around to find more.

47:21.120 --> 47:26.800
MS reached out to various individuals affiliated with Dugway, including one such person.

47:26.800 --> 47:32.440
MS stated, quote, I reached out to him and got him to talk about my situation by accident,

47:32.440 --> 47:33.200
end quote.

47:33.200 --> 47:40.400
This individual, pseudonym GP, worked in legacy operations at Dugway and possibly still does today.

47:40.400 --> 47:46.560
GP was a senior chemist involved in Dugway's UAP legacy programs, both above ground and

47:46.560 --> 47:51.520
in the subterranean facility, where he claimed a light rail system connected the Dugway

47:51.520 --> 47:54.480
Dumb to numerous others around the country.

47:54.480 --> 47:57.200
GP commented little about himself.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.960
He primarily discussed with MS what he went through at Avery.

48:00.960 --> 48:07.120
What we do know about GP according to MS is he is a DOD chemist by degree and was moved

48:08.080 --> 48:12.320
after being promoted to work in UAP legacy programs.

48:12.320 --> 48:18.080
MS lost connection with GP when he left C Martin in 2014, but we are attempting to get

48:18.080 --> 48:20.080
in contact with him today.

48:20.080 --> 48:25.120
Often when discussing legacy program operations, we discuss research and development.

48:25.120 --> 48:30.960
Engineers, physicists, military brass, the discussion of a chemist is indeed intriguing.

48:30.960 --> 48:36.000
However, high level DOD chemists involved with technologies of unknown origin would most

48:36.000 --> 48:41.920
certainly be stationed at Dugway, the nation's premier chemical and biological testing facility.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.720
What exactly did GP do at Dugway?

48:44.720 --> 48:49.760
This is unknown, but speculating possibly his position could have seen him operating with

48:49.760 --> 48:53.280
chemistry concepts surrounding the craft's propulsion system.

48:53.280 --> 48:59.600
Analyzing biologics, studying metallurgy, the list is truly endless, but GP did have enough

48:59.600 --> 49:04.160
knowledge to inform MS of the mapping system he saw near the craft.

49:04.160 --> 49:09.440
And you'd almost have coordinates on there is what I can describe.

49:09.440 --> 49:14.480
So the way that that's set up to me is what it looked like in mapping system.

49:14.480 --> 49:19.120
When I talked to the gentleman that was over top of a lot of that stuff out there,

49:20.880 --> 49:30.240
he said they're basically able to put on that system two points of references or whatever

49:30.240 --> 49:35.040
they're going to do on reference points and basically generate a wormhole and drop through.

49:35.680 --> 49:43.040
And so that's where he says that interstellar travel is how they get from point A to point B

49:43.040 --> 49:43.920
so quickly.

49:43.920 --> 49:50.080
In short, GP stated the craft was extraterrestrial and operated via gravity displacement but

49:50.080 --> 49:51.680
wouldn't come at further.

49:51.680 --> 49:58.080
Now MS received confirmation from both GP and a current railroad co-worker of a massive

49:58.080 --> 50:00.560
underground facility beneath Dugway.

50:00.560 --> 50:06.400
The co-worker even claimed to have assisted in digging out the tunneling system beneath DPG.

50:06.400 --> 50:11.040
MS and myself are currently setting up time to meet with this individual as well.

50:11.040 --> 50:17.760
Deep underground military bases, DUMs, aka subterranean facilities or STFs are a keen

50:17.760 --> 50:22.240
interest of mine, especially in relation to UAP legacy programs.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.800
DUMs do indeed exist.

50:24.800 --> 50:30.000
Quite often planned as underground ICBM facilities, underground command bunkers,

50:30.000 --> 50:34.560
corporate facilities or COG continuity of government installations.

50:34.560 --> 50:38.960
Indeed, even deep underground tunnel systems have been planned to connect these facilities

50:38.960 --> 50:41.440
like in studies conducted by TRW.

50:41.440 --> 50:46.480
Massive machines called tunnel boring machines and nuclear subterranes have historically been

50:46.480 --> 50:49.760
associated with such intriguing underground work.

50:49.760 --> 50:54.480
In fact, the United States National Research Council has historically published special

50:54.480 --> 51:00.880
projects on the creation of DUMs, such as this 1981 and 1982 workshop on technology for

51:00.880 --> 51:04.960
the design and construction of deep underground defense facilities.

51:04.960 --> 51:10.400
DUMs are not our focus today besides under Dugway, but again, I have discussed such

51:10.400 --> 51:15.120
underground facilities before and plan to tackle the subject fully in the future.

51:15.120 --> 51:19.200
For now I'll leave you with numerous underground tunnel systems in western states

51:19.200 --> 51:22.160
detailed by the US Bureau of Reclamation.

51:22.160 --> 51:27.120
Many tunnel systems listed in this report feature tunnel distances of tens of thousands

51:27.120 --> 51:33.040
of feet of length, tens of feet of diameter covered by hundreds or thousands of feet of earth.

51:33.040 --> 51:38.400
Now many such tunnels serve as waterways and aqueducts, however it is fascinating to see

51:38.400 --> 51:41.520
such a volume of massive underground tunnels.

51:41.520 --> 51:45.760
It is critical to mention the Bureau of Reclamation was one of the key members

51:45.760 --> 51:52.400
on the 1981 and 1982 joint project discussing deep underground defense facilities we mentioned above.

51:53.200 --> 51:59.600
GP would state this underground facility at an undisclosed depth spanned 1300 square miles,

51:59.600 --> 52:02.640
which is the size of Dugway proving ground itself.

52:02.640 --> 52:06.800
The tunnels connecting Dugway to other underground installations were wide enough to

52:06.800 --> 52:10.240
transport enormous aircraft such as a 747.

52:10.240 --> 52:16.320
These rail systems operated off of magnetics, popularly referred to as maglev trains.

52:16.960 --> 52:21.840
It's 1300 square miles underneath and then there's a light rail system is what he said.

52:21.840 --> 52:27.280
He goes that light rail system is connected to every base in the nation and can transport the

52:27.280 --> 52:32.480
president's plane basically anywhere they need to without putting it in the air.

52:32.480 --> 52:38.320
Maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetics rather than employing wheels.

52:38.320 --> 52:44.000
Maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad systems including higher speeds,

52:44.000 --> 52:49.280
superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, improved gradient handling

52:49.280 --> 52:54.160
and lower noise, but are much more expensive compared to traditional systems.

52:54.160 --> 52:59.280
Maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour.

52:59.280 --> 53:04.880
Now the implementation of maglev train systems connecting dumps is often seen as conspiracy.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.600
However, this is an incorrect assumption.

53:07.600 --> 53:13.600
In 1986, FFRDC Los Alamos National Labs published a study titled, quote,

53:13.600 --> 53:19.120
sub saline, a nuclear powered melt tunneling concept for high speed lunar subsurface

53:19.120 --> 53:20.960
transportation tunnels, end quote.

53:20.960 --> 53:26.000
The intriguing study discussed the creation of subsurface lunar tunnels connecting manned

53:26.000 --> 53:31.680
installations that would feature maglev or other high speed train transportation systems.

53:31.680 --> 53:37.280
And while discussing specifics of the dump, I must once again state I am not releasing

53:37.280 --> 53:38.960
any classified information.

53:38.960 --> 53:42.880
Everything discussed from here on out is all public domain.

53:42.880 --> 53:48.000
The entrance to the subterranean facility is accessible from a tiny building in the middle

53:48.000 --> 53:51.520
of the West Desert Test Center near German Village, Dugway.

53:51.520 --> 53:57.600
According to GP, the entrance is solely an elevator to take personnel to the installation.

53:57.600 --> 54:04.960
This entrance does not supply the Dugway Dumb with materials, food, supplies, logistics, etc.

54:04.960 --> 54:10.000
Instead, the Dumb is internally supplied from tunnels connecting the base to other subterranean

54:10.000 --> 54:11.040
facilities.

54:11.040 --> 54:16.880
When I last discussed MS and UFO witnesses redacted list, I did not cover the supposed

54:16.880 --> 54:19.840
entrance to the Dugway subterranean facility.

54:19.840 --> 54:25.200
Since covering MS's story, Stephen Greer has taken it upon himself to leak this supposed

54:25.200 --> 54:26.640
entrance himself.

54:26.640 --> 54:33.360
See on screen now the critical update displaying the Dugway Dumb entrance on the DPI archive.

54:33.360 --> 54:38.400
As mentioned above, this remote entrance is indeed on Dugway's West Desert Test Center

54:38.400 --> 54:43.840
and is quite close to the Avery Technical Center and Michael Army Airfield, while lying

54:43.840 --> 54:48.960
between properties considered as Air Force lease rentals on Dugway-proving ground.

54:48.960 --> 54:54.000
Analyzing Google Earth historical imagery, it appears this entrance was constructed sometime

54:54.000 --> 54:57.200
between 1993 and 2006.

54:57.200 --> 55:02.000
It could however be much older, as satellite resolution does not allow us to see clearly

55:02.000 --> 55:03.440
at these older dates.

55:03.440 --> 55:09.040
According to GP, much of the Dugway Dumb operations reside under nearby Granite Peak,

55:09.040 --> 55:14.160
which sits just west of the alleged entrance in Avery and Ditto areas.

55:14.160 --> 55:18.800
What is quite interesting to me is the fact that 388th Range Squadron out of Hill and

55:18.800 --> 55:23.440
Michael Army Airfield runs multiple sites on and just north of the mountain.

55:23.440 --> 55:28.080
I'd like to focus specifically on the Mini-Mute stations 10 and 2.

55:28.080 --> 55:33.360
Mini-Mutes are threat emitter systems commonly utilized to train pilots to recognize and

55:33.360 --> 55:36.080
respond to various enemy radar threats.

55:36.080 --> 55:41.280
One must wonder if the Granite Peak South Station has entrances to or interactions

55:41.280 --> 55:44.160
with a supposed facility under the mountain.

55:44.160 --> 55:49.600
MS's disclosures are truly astonishing, and I must preface I am speculating here,

55:49.600 --> 55:54.320
but from MS's testimony, a strong thesis can be extracted.

55:54.320 --> 56:02.000
MS stumbled upon a joint army and USAF MRTFB UFO Legacy operation operating between ATEC

56:02.000 --> 56:07.920
and the 388th Range Squadron, with the aid of white coat contractors such as Battelle Memorial

56:07.920 --> 56:11.200
Institute and Jacob Solutions, more on them later.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.200
This program operates above and beneath Dugway Proving Ground.

56:15.200 --> 56:20.240
The clandestine program utilizes the Avery Technical Center's internal rail system

56:20.240 --> 56:25.760
to transport non-human craft and materials onto unmarked secretive Avery buildings such as the

56:25.760 --> 56:29.040
test operations and classified storage buildings.

56:29.040 --> 56:34.640
Program scientists and the 388th Range Squadron utilize the southern part of the Utah test

56:34.640 --> 56:39.760
and training range to test extraterrestrial vehicles or alien reproduction vehicles.

56:39.760 --> 56:44.960
This would operate similarly to what witness Ed described with the joint UFO reverse engineering

56:44.960 --> 56:49.840
program between the Edwards 412 test wing and Nevada test and training range.

56:49.840 --> 56:55.600
The program also utilizes top chemistry and biology subject matter experts from ATEC and

56:55.600 --> 57:01.520
DPG's chemical and biological defense program to either study biologics or engage with any

57:01.520 --> 57:04.160
relevant aspects of non-human craft.

57:04.160 --> 57:09.680
The Dugway DUM communicates and operates alongside other DUM locations across the continental

57:09.680 --> 57:16.960
United States, likely hidden within and below major military installations and MRTFBs.

57:16.960 --> 57:22.080
A truly incredible thesis, but one that can be reasonably constructed based upon the testimony

57:22.080 --> 57:24.800
of MS in study of Dugway Proving Ground.

57:30.080 --> 57:34.480
Lastly, I just want to briefly touch on some contractor operations at Dugway.

57:34.480 --> 57:40.160
Remember, MS claimed over half of Dugway's operations related to contracting work.

57:40.240 --> 57:47.360
In fiscal year 2013, according to the GAO, Dugway's West Desert test range saw about 77%

57:47.360 --> 57:53.920
of acknowledged work conducted for the CBDP, Chemical Biological Defense Program Enterprise.

57:53.920 --> 58:00.480
Now, what contractor might come to mind that deals in depth with chemical and biological concepts?

58:00.480 --> 58:03.520
That's right, Battelle Memorial Institute.

58:03.520 --> 58:07.920
I have covered Battelle at length before, including their project STORC, which was

58:07.920 --> 58:13.280
tasked by USG to study UAP, parallel but independent to Project Blue Book.

58:13.280 --> 58:18.000
I have also investigated Battelle and their curious links to nickel titanium alloys,

58:18.000 --> 58:24.400
which may just have been the shape memory alloy recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash.

58:24.400 --> 58:27.040
I highly recommend viewing that project.

58:27.040 --> 58:32.320
Battelle runs a host of biochem facilities, including the Battelle National Biodefense

58:32.320 --> 58:34.800
Institute at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

58:34.800 --> 58:39.760
This location has recently become entwined with UFO lore as a possible location where

58:39.760 --> 58:42.160
non-human biologics are stored.

58:42.160 --> 58:47.840
There is additionally now the alleged infamous exobiospheric organism molecular biologist

58:47.840 --> 58:51.680
Reddit whistleblower testimony focused on this Battelle location.

58:51.680 --> 58:56.720
But these claims are absent from this investigation as they require much more research.

58:56.720 --> 58:59.200
To add further intrigue, at Fort Detrick,

58:59.200 --> 59:03.520
Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,

59:03.520 --> 59:06.880
FFRDC, for the Department of Homeland Security.

59:06.880 --> 59:11.440
Specifically, the DHS, Undersecretary for Science and Technology.

59:11.440 --> 59:15.520
I would once again like to draw attention to a primary thesis of this channel that

59:15.520 --> 59:20.080
FFRDC and UARC often act as project managers,

59:20.080 --> 59:27.920
serving as subject matter experts performing R&D work in joint USG and contractor UAP legacy programs.

59:27.920 --> 59:32.400
And remember how we previously discussed the CBDP programs at Dugway.

59:32.400 --> 59:38.480
While analyzing this joint multinational and interagency CBDP Test and Evaluation

59:38.480 --> 59:44.800
Partners chart, we can see Dugway and Battelle are both listed as select few program locations.

59:44.800 --> 59:49.120
In fact, the West Desert Test Center and Fort Detrick's National Interagency

59:49.120 --> 59:53.760
Biodefense Campus at which Battelle operates are additionally quite intimate,

59:53.760 --> 01:00:00.480
serving as two of four of CBDP's primary research and development and test and evaluation facilities.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.280
Now, I know that's a lot, but Battelle has historically also worked closely with Dugway,

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:11.760
including operating the Chemical and Biological Defense Information Analysis Center, CBIC,

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.120
that operates at Dugway. According to excellent UFO researcher Anthony Bregalia,

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.400
Battelle additionally has a design slash build division with capabilities for creating laboratories

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.320
and other specialized facilities. In one article, Bregalia referenced multiple open source documents

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.800
that discussed Battelle's facility design and construction management work at Dugway.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.680
According to these documents, Battelle has engineered enclosed testing facilities and sealed

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.680
structures at DPG that according to one technical report, quote,

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:47.040
meet stringent containment standards, providing a degree of protection that has never been achieved

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:53.120
before, end quote. Battelle's facility design services also include specialized locations such as

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:58.720
clean rooms. I must reference back to the testimony of MS and the clean room that held the UFO.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.840
Perhaps a full investigation into Battelle's construction work at DPG is warranted.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.640
DPG and Fort Detrick's connections with each other and Battelle are quite interesting,

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.240
but this is where things get downright strange. The director of Dugway's West Desert Test Center

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:20.720
is one Mr. Ryan W. Harris. Harris is, quote, responsible for the overall planning, directing,

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.080
and evaluating all aspects of work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.440
test and training programs executed by the test center, end quote. Harris received a bachelor's

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:37.120
in chemical engineering and served in the army as a chemical officer. In the year 2000, Harris

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.560
would accept a project manager position working with Battelle at Dugway. This Battelle work saw

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.160
Harris overseeing several testing and training programs, and in 2004, Harris would accept a

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:54.000
project manager position with Dugway and work his way all the way up the ranks until 2012,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.240
where he achieved the position as WTC test director, where he now evaluates all aspects of

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:06.240
the work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition test and training programs executed

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.240
by the test center. Interesting how a Battelle project manager becomes director of an MRTFB

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.240
where witnesses have claimed a UAP legacy program employing DOD chemists takes place.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.000
But we don't stop there. Meet US Army chemical engineering core member Greg Frank. Frank served

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.320
as a chemist for the chemical laboratory division at Dugway Proving Ground from 1984 to 1985,

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.040
quote. He directed and performed chemical studies and developed procedures for chemical

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.800
testing and analysis utilizing modern analytical instrumentation, end quote. While serving as

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.920
test officer, Frank would branch out into numerous vehicle and chemical munition programs,

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.160
developing material test plans and test operational plans. When he left service in 1985,

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.880
Frank joined Battelle as a project manager and principal investigator where he, quote,

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.080
managed both the technical and financial aspects of numerous projects in the areas of chemical

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:08.880
and biological defense, end quote. As of 2008, Frank operated as executive vice president for Battelle

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.960
Science and Technology International and is responsible for over 5,000 scientists, engineers,

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.840
and supporting staff. But believe it or not, these are not the only connections we can make with

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:26.880
WDTC leadership and Battelle. We can also take a keen look at Anders Weiborg, former director of

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.800
Special Programs Division at the West Desert Test Center. Now working for the DOE, Weiborg once

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.720
served at Dugway, ensuring execution of daily operations within the test center. Before working

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.640
at Dugway, Weiborg worked at Battelle, serving as a test director responsible for TNE of chemical

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:50.400
and biological defense equipment. Battelle and Dugway share intimate connections, likely myriad

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.760
more than we have just scratched today. Other contractors at Dugway are of extreme interest

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.440
as well and will likely serve as suspects of future investigations, such as Jacob Solutions,

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:08.480
who performs range testing and lab services at WDTC. This contractor operates a premium facility at

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.480
Dugway Ditto and sees strong ties to its board of directors and the Carlisle Group. However,

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.320
due to the intense focus of Dugway on biochem weapons programs, Battelle will remain our primary

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:27.040
suspect in UAP legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground. Hey guys, it's Gerb and I'd like to

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:32.240
thank you all so much for joining me today as we took this extended look into Dugway Proving Ground.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.960
Now, why did we partake in this investigation? Well, for one, something I've noticed and I'm

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.880
sure many other have is discussion of Dugway around UFOs and legacy programs are quite intertwined.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.160
However, there is barely any other discussion or research or claims or testimony involving Dugway.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:59.760
I think the perfect example of this is the beginning quest TV video featuring Nick Pope

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:05.040
talking about Area 51 to Area 52. This entire 10-15 minute video on YouTube,

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.960
of course, the link will be in the description, discusses Area 51 and Dugway and talks about

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.520
it being the new Area 51. This video even features words from Richard Dolan. However,

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:24.560
zero evidence or testimony or anything is presented here. So after having the testimony of MS,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:30.240
after having some of the words of Stephen Greer, A.H., A.J. Kratok and others, I thought it very

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.320
pertinent to actually dive into Dugway. Now, I have reason to believe that Dugway is indeed a

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:42.400
premier legacy reverse engineering material exploitation program. So I wanted to sift through

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.880
all of this information and present an argument, especially as we started to look

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:54.320
into Dugway structure and how Dugway is comprised of two major range test facility bases, a huge

01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:01.120
piece of this investigation. As we know with the testimony of Ed, his claims of a reverse

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:07.840
engineering program covered two Air Force MRTFBs, the Edwards 412 test wing and the Nevada test and

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:14.160
training range. Dugway gives us an interesting look because due to the testimony of MS, we can

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.800
conclude of a joint reverse engineering program versus two branches of the military MRTFBs,

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.960
the Army's West Desert Test Center and the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range. This,

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.760
of course, then involves Army ATEC and their Joint Chemical Biological Defense Program

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:39.680
and the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby Hill Air Force Base. I tried to do many connections

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:46.400
between the 388th RANS, Range Squadron as it's listed, and the Edwards 412 test wing. Unfortunately,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:51.280
there is very little to chew on there. However, I do think the argument presented here is strong

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:58.400
enough and there's enough valuable data and listed data here for any policymaker or any individual

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:06.960
with influence to conduct a comprehensive analysis of MS and others' claims. Now, of course, twice

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:12.800
in this video around the stiff sub-training facility location, I listed a disclaimer that

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:19.920
I was using only publicly available information. Now, I do this because when all the way back

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.920
when discussing NSWC Crane and the testimony of RA, or we now know Randy Anderson, I caught a little

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:32.640
bit of flak and a little bit of fright for mentioning Crane and the possibility that this could be a

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:38.160
catastrophic disclosure and could be a breach of national security due to this being an underground

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.040
location. Therefore, when discussing the dumb locations, I needed to preface by saying this

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.480
information was all public domain. And I thank you, Stephen Greer, for leaking that on the DPI

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.480
archive because that finally gave me a chance to talk about these locations. Seen as the last time

01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:00.240
I covered MS, I was privy to these locations but did not think it appropriate to list them. But

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.320
Greer took it upon himself to list Granite Peak and the alleged dumb location by German Village

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:11.120
himself. So thank you for that. And I must state once again, as I did in the last project,

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.800
do not under any circumstances go looking for that location. Dugway Proving Ground is protected

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:24.800
land and protected airspace. These are military assets, do not go to the location. Okay, if that

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:30.720
is a location to a deep underground military base, which I highly wager it is, do not go there.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.640
Okay, let's make that very clear. Just do not for your own safety, please.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:45.600
Don't. So there's other data to discuss surrounding Dugway. As we saw with the Dugway

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:53.120
history, there's not much linking Dugway to UAP legacy programs, unlike something like Edwards,

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:59.280
or Norton, or even China Lake or White Sands Missile Range. One of the biggest features of

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:04.240
this project was of course the garrison crash, and then some of the claims of Area 51 being

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.200
moved to Area 52. Conversely, for a place like Edwards, we have the story of Kent Selen and the

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.200
ARV and, you know, numerous craft and operations being incited at Dugway. There is more in this

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.080
video. I wasn't able to include one such story is the testimony of current Air Force Colonel

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.240
Weinbrenner. Now Weinbrenner has a very interesting story as if anybody can remember back to the

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:33.440
Jesse Michaels interview with James Fox filmmaker James Fox. Fox discusses a film of the

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:40.320
Holloman Air Force base landing and how his friend Alan or yes, Alan Sandler viewed this film and

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:47.680
told Fox about it. Well, back in the 70s, Alan Sandler and his co video producer Robert Emanager

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.240
were attempting to make a documentary on UAP. This is when they were sequestered by two

01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:00.560
enlisted Air Force personnel and shown the Holloman film and were licensed to utilize

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.760
the film. But that licensing was pulled soon thereafter. One of these individuals was Colonel

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:12.080
Weinbrenner. Now on Colonel Weinbrenner's deathbed to close friends and families, he allegedly

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:19.520
said that Utah is where the alien bodies are stored. Now that's a very interesting disclosure

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.080
where the alien bodies are stored. This would be a very interesting place for this to be

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.640
Dugway. You know, of course, quite often Fort Detrick is talked about. I do believe Lou mentioned

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.960
this in imminent as well, but as a place for biologics to be stored. And this is where

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:42.560
much chemical and biological defense systems are ran. And there's extreme ties to Dugway

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:50.160
with Fort Detrick. So there's also interesting data to explore of Dugway being not just a craft

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:58.480
exploitation program on the UTTR, but also a biologic study area. Could this be where biologics

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:03.360
autopsies take place where biological tissue is studied quite possibly. But this would be kept

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.040
under wraps as any chemical and biological data and information and study is incredibly

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.920
secretive and incredibly classified. As we've seen with Dugway, you know, Dugway's projects are

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:22.160
not spoken of often and 77% of Dugway's programs according to the GAO are conducted for the chemical

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:28.880
and biological defense program. I would like to know what everybody else here thought. And while

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.320
you're leaving your comments, let's also tuck into the testimony of MS. Of course, I had talked to

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.440
MS all the way back in June of 2024. And those are the clips I have used for the conversation

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.440
in this video exploration. I do plan to interview MS again, hopefully in person,

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:53.920
if that can be arranged. Hopefully, that can also be done with GP and the individual who claimed he

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.680
helped build the railroad system under Dugway. Such an investigation and interview with these

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.760
three individuals would truly be consequential. You know, I find a lot of value in MS's testimony

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.880
not because of him being reached out to by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which he

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:17.280
indeed was. I said in the project that he had received, I have seen the outreach from these

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:25.120
individuals wishing for him to go to the Hill to testify, but also because his testimony at Ditto

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:31.760
and Avery leads to such fruitful research. As we've seen with Avery, it has numerous,

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.240
numerous fascinating buildings that could be used for such operations, classified storage,

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.760
test operations, photo O&M, internal rail system to the Dugway deep underground facility,

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.160
just a very fascinating testimony to cover. And I must add, with the Dugway Dumb being just some

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:56.400
small type of concrete facility out in the desert, just serving as an elevator to a Dumb,

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:04.720
where it's this entrance point doesn't serve to transport vehicles or armor or logistics or weaponry

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:12.240
or food or anything but personnel traveling down. I must be quite plain here. In my videos,

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.400
I don't generally like to say, well, a source told me this, a source told me this, a source told me

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:24.080
this, but I do have a friend that has formerly served in the United States Army. This was in the

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:32.960
early 2010s that has talked to me about traveling in stiffs, subterranean facilities. I cannot reveal

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:40.080
these locations, but he said he traveled across state lines between stiffs in an underground

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:47.840
rail system that went so fast, it reminded him of flying in a plane of which he has great fear.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:54.400
So the fear of a plane's acceleration is what he felt in the train. What was interesting to me

01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:01.200
is the location to which he traveled. The entrance way to that location was a small,

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:08.640
what you could call janitorial building or kind of potable water treatment building in the middle

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:15.360
of nowhere. Just a small building nestled in a location that accessing these buildings took

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.560
you to an elevator to a deep underground facility. This is not the only individual I've talked to

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.440
who has accessed a stiff or a dumb, maybe we'll call them stiffs because it carries a little

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.840
more weight. I've talked to numerous people who have this is why this topic carries such great

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.320
interest to me, especially because dumps or stiffs are indeed real. As I said, oftentimes for corporate

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:43.040
facilities such as AT&T, who at least in the 90s and 2000s housed many underground server banks and

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.080
ICBM storage locations underground and possibly underwater under ocean surface as well,

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.760
as well as continuity of government COG installation COG continuity of government

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.320
reminds me a lot of when Colonel John B. Alexander, who isn't the most trustworthy in my opinion,

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:06.080
talked about Majestic 12 being real and serving as a continuity of government type institution.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.400
This also reminds me of what also reminds me of continuity of government

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.560
is the description of the dugway done by GP, which can talk about transporting the president's plane

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:22.480
to anywhere in the country. So I hope everybody enjoyed this dive into dugway. I'd like to know

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:27.920
what everybody thinks. This was a very important project to me because, you know, just as in every

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:36.480
single video I discuss SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, FFRDCs or UARCs, I can now incorporate

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:42.320
such testimony of major range test facility bases and TNE, Test and Evaluation, Research and

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.240
Development Test and Evaluation, RD, TNE into my projects. Remember, guys, when he left service,

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:56.400
Witness Ed served on the Pentagon for Air Force RD, TNE. And this is where he claims that $34

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.760
and $40 billion went missing to non-authorized transfer of authority funds in fiscal year,

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:08.480
I think 2013 and 2014. So doge, if you're watching, go look at Air Force and possibly Army RD, TNE.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.680
Anyways, what else can we discuss, guys? More interesting projects coming down the way.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.680
As I say in every project, I do in fact have a Patreon if you want to support the channel.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.520
I don't gatekeep any content, only support what you think the channel is worth. And please

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.080
remember to like and subscribe, guys. These investigations are my heart and soul. They do

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.360
take a long time. So any comments about your thoughts on the investigation is much appreciated.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.360
If you've noticed some oddness with the old I here, I'm dealing with some problems because that is

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.760
what happens when you grapple with individuals who do not wash their training equipment enough,

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:50.240
do not wash their rash guards. So thank you to that person who decided to wrestle with a very

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.560
disgusting rash guard. I really appreciate that. But I'm also quite elated, guys, because

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.440
anybody who watches the channel and has interacted with me knows I am an Alexander Volkanovsky

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.440
superfan. And our glorious king has just been booked to fight Diego Lopez, blockhead Diego Lopez

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:14.400
at UFC 314 in Miami come April. So I am elated about that, that the dangerous power puncher

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:21.680
Toporio is moving up to lightweight and vacating the belt. This is sweet Christmas to me. So let

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.120
me know what you guys think about the investigation, guys. Please remember to like and subscribe,

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.520
and I will see everybody on the next show. Thank you.
