0	10680	Officially designated as the Dugway Proving Ground, this military facility covers an astounding
10680	17200	1,250 square miles of the Great Salt Lake Desert.
17200	23360	Dugway's official mission is to test top-secret weapons and aerospace systems, but UFO researchers
23360	30360	believe the true purpose of Area 52 is even more sinister.
54320	59840	When you imagine UFO legacy program operations focused on the retrieval and exploitation
59840	65040	of technologies of unknown origin, what kind of facilities come to mind?
65040	69600	Is it Area 51, and it's alleged legendary auxiliary site S-4?
69600	74360	Maybe you think of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, and it's possible off-world
74360	76080	technologies division?
76080	80420	Or perhaps you reference China Lake Weapon Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Wright Patterson
81380	85500	Air Force Base, or any number of U.S. Department of Defense installations that are steeped in
85500	87300	UFO lore?
87300	93300	Maybe, just maybe, when imagining UFO legacy program locations, you picture Dugway Proving
93300	99980	Ground, an enormous 1,300 square mile U.S. Army installation nestled between three mountain
99980	106780	ranges in remote Utah that specializes in the testing of biological and chemical weapons.
106780	111900	Even referred to as Area 52, Dugway Proving Ground rose to prominence in the late 90s as
111900	117900	the successor to Area 51's UFO programs due to heavy public exposure on the once-denied
117900	119380	Nevada site.
119380	125180	Ever since, the Utah site and accompanying two premier MRTFBs have been the focus for
125180	129580	deep-six clandestine UAP operations.
129580	134460	But this spotlight doesn't solely focus on the enormous facilities sprawling across the
134460	135660	Utah desert.
135660	141380	Dugway has additionally been accused as the location of a dumb, a deep underground military
141380	142380	base.
142380	147620	Today we shed light on Dugway and discussion of its technologies of unknown origin, exploitation
147620	150460	programs, and subterranean presence.
150460	156780	Through analysis of the facility's intriguing Army and Air Force MRTFBs, study of defense
156780	163060	contractors present on site, and careful evaluation of the witness testimony of one MS, who I
163140	168980	have covered on this channel before, who stumbled upon a craft of likely non-human origin at
168980	171340	the infamous Dugway range.
171340	175820	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we venture into the
175820	180860	world of legacy UFO programs to analyze Dugway Proving Ground.
180860	185660	How deep does the rabbit hole go between the United States' premier biological and chemical
185660	189460	weapons testing facility and non-human technology?
189460	195580	But individuals, military units, and corporations possibly engage with Dugway and UFO reverse
195580	199180	engineering and material exploitation programs.
199180	205100	And does Dugway operate such UFO programs above and below the Earth's surface?
205100	212100	Join me today as we find out.
212620	219060	Dugway Proving Ground is located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Tawilla County, Utah.
219060	225580	The site encompasses over 1,250 square miles and it is larger than the U.S. state of Rhode
225580	226740	Island.
226740	232540	The site itself is ideal for seclusion and privacy free from urban encroachment, light
232540	236820	pollution, and excess acoustic and electronic noise.
236820	241020	Dugway is surrounded by mountains, salt flats, and desert terrain.
241020	245940	These geological features combined with a defense retainer that will apprehend approaching
245940	250140	civilians with armed personnel and black-op helicopters.
250140	256900	Make the Utah Proving Ground perfect for clandestine and classified military test and evaluation.
256900	263100	Dugway was founded in 1942 with the mission to test U.S. and allied chemical and biological
263100	269960	defense systems and perform nuclear, biological, and chemical survivability testing and training
269960	275460	of defense material using chemical and biological agents and stimulants.
275460	280860	The Utah Proving Ground uses its state-of-the-art laboratories and chambers to conduct testing
280860	285300	and training under environmentally controlled conditions.
285300	290580	Dugway's inception arose from the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks which quickly saw the United
290580	297020	States military increase military capabilities in numerous areas including chemical and biological
297020	298180	warfare.
298180	303540	The infamous site has participated in the never-ending global war on terrorism, employing
303540	309100	Special Forces mission rehearsals, classified testing, and biochem urgent need equipment
309100	310100	testing.
310100	316460	Dugway has a laundry list of significant accomplishments including unmanned aerial systems test support,
316460	320780	but we will skip over exploring this entire list of accomplishments.
320780	326740	According to a 2021 U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground Mission and Capabilities Overview public
326740	331540	report, Dugway is a massive contributor to Utah's economy.
331540	339900	Deploying a total of 2,120 employees in residence, 784 of which are primarily Army and Air Force
339900	347100	contractors, 622 of which consist of primary mission and installation contracting command,
347100	354540	think on-site security personnel, and 486 of these military or defense agency civilians.
354540	360740	Dugway or DPG, as we'll refer to it throughout this project, partners with myriad U.S. military,
360740	365260	government, and intelligence agencies including many that harbor our interest throughout this
365260	366260	investigation.
366260	374500	U.S. Army Airborne, Navy, SOCOM, a.k.a. Special Operations Command, the 388th Range Squadron
374500	380660	out of Hill Air Force Base, Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Interior, NASA,
380660	382700	and three universities.
382700	388180	Out of these three universities, I would like to draw specific mention to Utah State University.
388180	394300	U.S.U. employs a university affiliated research center, UARC, for the Missile Defense Agency
394300	397780	known as the Space Dynamics Laboratory.
397780	402820	In numerous projects, I have spoken on UARCs and their similar counterparts Federally Funded
402820	405540	Research and Development Center's FFRDCs.
405540	411700	FFRDCs and UARCs are semi-private, DOD-driven research and development institutions.
411700	417780	I have spoken ad nauseam, our key contributors to UAP legacy programs.
417780	424140	While not the topic of today, UARCs and FFRDCs likely exist as a sort of project manager,
424140	428700	serving as subject matter experts and research and development leaders for joint corporate
428700	431980	and U.S. government UAP programs.
431980	438180	In fact, I believe these two types of institutions to be exponentially more knowledgeable on and
438180	444300	crucial to UFO exploitation programs than most defense contractors through their sole source
444300	445300	contracts.
445300	450820	On this topic for another day, however, FFRDC will come up again throughout this presentation.
450820	455620	For this investigation, we will primarily be focusing on two locations on Dugway known
455620	460940	as MRTFBs, Major Range Test and Facility Bases.
460940	466880	MRTFBs are known as the, quote, core set of DOD test and evaluation infrastructure and
466880	472820	associated workforce that must be preserved as a national asset to provide T&E capabilities
472900	476500	to support the DOD acquisition system, end quote.
476500	482540	The quote unquote critical core of test bases comprise over 10 million acres of land in
482540	490900	the United States, employ over 25,000 people annually and receive over $4 billion in acknowledged
490900	492540	funding annually.
492540	499700	There exists a total of 23 acknowledged MRTFBs, eight Army including Yuma Test Center, Arizona
499700	502300	and White Sands missile range.
502300	507580	Six Navy installations including Naval Air Warfare Center Pax River and China Lake Naval
507580	514420	Warfare Center and seven Air Force Bases including Edwards 412 Test Wing, Nevada Test and Training
514420	520460	Range and the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg and two defense agency bases.
520460	525980	Many here will associate all listed locations with mentions of UFO legacy programs.
525980	532340	I myself have extensively published on witness Ed, who spoke of a joint UFO reverse engineering
532340	538260	operation between the Nevada Test and Training Range and Edwards 412 Test Wing in California.
538260	542380	I strongly recommend viewing this project if you have not already.
542380	549580	Dugway Proving Ground possesses one such MRTFB, the US Army's West Desert Test Center and
549580	555540	also shares the South Range of the Air Force's MRTFB, Utah Test and Training Range with
555540	558100	nearby Hill Air Force Base.
558100	563860	Pay close attention to these two major bases as when we analyze the testimony of MS we
563860	570020	will be exploring a thesis of a joint Army and Air Force legacy program comprised of
570020	577660	the WDTC West Desert Test Center and the UTTR Utah Test and Training Range that extend deep
577660	580100	below the Earth's surface.
580100	585460	And while on the subject of MRTFB's we will dive into much more detail later on including
585460	590540	discussing the Avery Technical Center and shared Michael Army Airfield which I believe
590540	595860	is the operational above ground testing location of this joint UFO project.
595860	600900	But before we venture into Dugway's history with UFO, let's touch on one more thing while
600900	604820	the West Desert Test Center is fresh in your mind.
604820	610260	Investors at WDTC are spearheaded by Army Test and Evaluation Command.
610260	616220	As we begin to implicate Dugway and thus ATEC as engaging in UFO legacy programs I find
616220	621700	the Army Test and Evaluation Organization structure well worth referencing.
621700	626260	Analyzing the reporting structure of ATEC, far up the food chain we can observe the Secretary
626260	630980	of the Army as well as the Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army answering
630980	634620	directly to the US Secretary of Defense.
634620	639260	Those subsets pertain to these four positions including Director of Operational Test and
639260	640740	Evaluation.
640740	646860	But what is interesting here is oversight and TNE policy as well as USA Tech Command
646860	653060	is independent from Conventional Army Research and Development Test and Evaluation structure.
653060	658060	This independence is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Office
658060	660300	of the Secretary of Defense.
660300	665820	This separation exists apparently to ensure warfighter safety through unbiased evaluation
665820	671020	as well as credibility with decision makers, but I can't help but to think here such a
671020	677420	structure could quickly lead to a lack of oversight on ATEC programs and thus a lack of oversight
677420	686540	on West Desert Test Center programs at Dugway Proving Ground.
686540	691580	Let us pause and reflect on historical mentions of Dugway and analyze how and why this site
691580	695140	has often been referred to as Area 52.
695140	700700	Serving as the United States premiered biological and chemical weapons facility, it is no surprise
700700	705940	the secrets of Dugway and its decades of classified operations are held close to the chest of
705940	708380	US military and intelligence.
708380	714940	I would like to briefly discuss a fascinating alleged 1953 UFO crash retrieval case that
714940	722020	occurred less than one month after and solely 200 miles north of the infamous 1953 Kingman,
722020	723460	Arizona crash.
723460	729420	The Garrison, Utah UFO crash retrieval was investigated at length by UFO researcher Steve
729420	735500	Jones and relayed as a moderate confidence case in Ryan S. Woods masterpiece Magic Eyes
735500	736500	Only.
736500	742380	Steve Jones was first introduced to the case by a group called the Phoenix Project in 1993.
742380	750140	A group member Al discussed the case with 10-15 large aerial photos dated June of 1953.
750140	755980	These images apparently depicted a large valley with a triangular shaped area on the ground.
755980	761580	A remote station resides alongside the feature called the Desert Range Experimental Station,
761580	767260	or DRES, which is located on the southwest of Dugway's West Desert Test Center extending
767260	769300	from Tuila to Millard County.
769420	774900	DRES is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an arm of the Department of Agriculture.
774900	781700	The Phoenix Project group presented to Jones a DRES logbook dated 1979-1980 that featured
781700	788100	peculiar entries such as USAF and Army personnel from Fort Carson, Colorado, USAF command center
788100	791540	personnel and representatives from a defense contractor.
791540	796140	Phoenix Project believed the DRES to be a front for a secret research facility that
796140	801220	studied a crashed UFO that was buried resulting in the surrounding geology.
801220	806100	During his many visits to the site, Steve Jones was indeed able to track down witnesses
806100	809220	who claimed to see such a crashed object.
809220	813860	Local resident Bart Wright claimed as a child living 8 miles outside of Garrison, he saw
813860	819060	a strange blue light streak across the sky and crash near the side of the valley containing
819060	820060	DRES.
820060	824820	According to Wright, the impact caused the ground to shake and sky to light up.
824820	830620	Steve Jones hired a geologist in 1999 named Lamont Sorensen to conduct magnimeter and
830620	835500	seismic tests on the triangular formation where the craft allegedly crashed.
835500	840780	The geologist found no evidence of underground anomalies but did claim he did not think the
840780	842900	formation was made by nature.
842900	848220	He thought that some kind of artificial digging process did in fact take place.
848220	852780	Whenever a buried UFO is mentioned, this leads to an interesting case but ultimately the
852780	855580	Garrison Utah crash is a dead end.
855580	860140	I would also like to reference the story of the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle
860140	864020	many viewers of this channel will be quite familiar with.
864020	868780	During his decades of investigating into the copy vehicles observed by primary witness
868780	874820	Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, the late Mark McCandlish would
874820	880580	encounter multiple witnesses who had encountered and seen craft similar to the instantly identifiable
880580	882220	Fluxliner.
882220	888900	Of note were two photographs McCandlish obtained possession of from USAF Captain Harvey Williams.
888900	896980	Williams photographed this disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah.
896980	902300	The object bears striking resemblance to the Fluxliner and possibly details an intriguing
902300	908900	evolution in imaging technology from 1967 to Brad's observation in 1988.
908900	910020	Let me explain.
910020	916060	Brad and McCandlish claim the ARV flew via a synthetic vision system overlapping cameras
916060	921860	that allowed for a pilot inside the craft to access full 3D view when operating the craft.
921860	927940	The cameras were housed in protective acrylic bubbles almost appearing as off-the-shelf components.
927940	934200	Due to cameras being much larger in 1967, if the USAF Captain did indeed photograph an
934200	939760	early model of the Fluxliner, this would feature a larger synthetic vision system to accommodate
939760	941880	larger camera technology.
941880	947280	But I am equally, if not more, interested in the location of this sighting at a low altitude
947280	949280	of 12,000 feet.
949280	956480	Provo, Utah is only 100 miles from Dugway and less than 75 miles from Hill Air Force Base.
956480	961260	Remember what we discussed earlier, Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share runways such
961260	966780	as the Dugway-Michael Army Airfield and operate together in the Utah Test and Training Range
966780	968520	Southern Area.
968520	974300	Also recall the numerous mentions of MRTFBs and how two such critical cores reside on
974300	975300	Dugway.
975300	980140	I would once again like to reference witness Ed and the Joint Reverse Engineering Program
980140	985100	between the Edwards 412th Test Wing and the Nevada Test and Training Range.
985100	991620	Both the 412th and NTTR are Air Force MRTFBs just as the UTTR is.
991620	999180	The testimony of Ed explores two MRTFBs working in conjunction to test reverse engineered vehicles.
999180	1005780	USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet stated the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle saw operations
1005780	1011340	at Area 51 which is part of the NTTR and pilots inside the triangle were pulled from
1011340	1015440	Edwards Air Force Test Pilot School, part of the 412th.
1015440	1020300	The Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicles were allegedly shown at Norton Air Force Base
1020300	1026740	in 1988, which is with an extreme proximity to the fabled USAF Plant 42 and Edwards Air
1026740	1027980	Force Base.
1027980	1032900	If Harvey Williams did indeed image early iterations of the Fluxliner, this would imply
1032900	1038980	a UFO reverse engineering and ARV testing program between two MRTFBs.
1038980	1042600	Utah Test and Training Range and Edwards 412th Test Wing.
1042600	1047380	This is incredibly similar to the claims of Ed and Fouchet.
1047380	1052420	Further in this exploration, we will investigate a possible UFO legacy program operating across
1052420	1057940	both Army and Air Force MRTFBs at Dugway, but we will save this for later.
1057940	1064060	In June of 1997, Popular Mechanics Magazine published a stunning monthly issue.
1064060	1070260	The titular article titled The New Area 51 discussed the Air Force abandoning its once
1070260	1076020	most secretive site for top secret testing and moved to a new, more private location.
1076020	1081260	Let's, of course, dive into this intriguing article to discover the quote-unquote New
1081260	1085180	Area 51 and its secret airbase operations.
1085180	1088480	Right off the jump, the images in this piece are fascinating.
1088480	1094720	We see a sticky note that says, Call Admiral Inman at Science Applications International.
1094720	1098900	Now I know this isn't the subject of the video, but for an article that mocks the idea
1098900	1103840	of UFO reverse engineering programs by claiming those who believe the X-Files and existence
1103840	1108920	of a Dress Collection by former FBI Director Edgar Hoover are the type of people to believe
1108920	1113880	in UFO crash retrievals, why is Bobby Ray Inman mentioned?
1113880	1119520	Members of this channel may recall recent mention of Inman in the Northrop Grumman Project.
1119520	1125240	Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former NSA Director, CIA Deputy Director, and Science Applications
1125240	1132280	International Corporation SAIC Board Member, once discussed UFO recovered vehicles to NASA
1132280	1134800	mission specialist Bob Eschler.
1134800	1141320	Inman also referred Eschler to retired Rear Admiral and BDM Board Member Sumner Shapiro,
1141320	1146840	who informed Eschler, UAP retrievals would see teams take apart craft, pack them up,
1146840	1149920	and ship them around the country to different laboratories.
1149920	1155840	Inman is an integral figure in the discussion of UFO crash retrievals in the 1980s.
1155840	1161040	And I do not need to go into SAIC and their likely involvement in an off-world technologies
1161040	1163580	division at NSWC Crane.
1163580	1168880	This tiny sticky note in a rather deprecating article is incredibly interesting.
1168880	1174080	The popular mechanics piece states due to overexposure as America's worst kept secret
1174080	1176440	Area 51 shut down.
1176440	1179440	This is of course objectively false, however.
1179440	1184200	Later individuals we will discuss in this project reference a percentage of up to 40%
1184200	1188440	of Area 51's clandestine operations moving to Dugway.
1188440	1193320	One primary reason for the move out of Area 51 according to the popular mechanics author
1193320	1198320	Jim Wilson was the need for a different type of proving ground for ultra high performance
1198320	1200240	military aircraft.
1200240	1204240	After some impressive sleuthing including referencing Air Force Base Command General
1204240	1210320	Howell Estes and NASA Administrator Daniel Golden's 1997 agreement to share quote unquote
1210320	1217480	redundant assets, as well as a 1996 NASA announcement stating Michael Army Airfield would share
1217480	1223480	as a runway for several X-33 missions popular mechanics narrowed in on Utah.
1223480	1229400	In a quick side note, the X-33 aircraft capable of Mach 15 was a Lockheed Martin Skunkworks
1229400	1233200	production formed out of the Palmdale facility.
1233200	1238360	Both Michael Army Airfield which shits nestled on Dugway's West Desert Test Center within
1238360	1242360	the Avery Technical Center and don't worry much more on this later.
1242360	1247680	As well as Green River Utah Launch Complex part of White Sands missile range were ideal
1247680	1251160	installations for the new Area 51.
1251160	1255920	Michael Army Airfield possessed an equally if not more deterring surrounding area than
1255920	1257480	Area 51.
1257480	1262960	Not only is the airfield situated on 1300 square miles of Dugway ranges but it is also
1262960	1266600	bordered by numerous mountain ranges and salt flats.
1266600	1271440	The airfield did however lack adequate landing runways according to popular mechanics which
1271440	1278400	is why Utah Launch Complex situated only 200 miles away served as the ideal dance partner
1278400	1280560	for the Michael Army Airfield.
1280560	1285760	The magazine attempted flyovers of the airfield to snap images of the surrounding area but
1285760	1288240	were warned of being shot down.
1288240	1293760	Additionally, the magazine attempted to purchase satellite imagery of the Utah Launch Complex
1293760	1297520	but was denied due to security reasons.
1297520	1304400	The claims of a new Area 51 are not isolated to mainstream publishers like popular mechanics.
1304400	1308200	Let's revisit the testimony of Edgar Fouchet in the TR-3B.
1308200	1313000	Like I said in the Northrop Project, many are critical of Fouchet due to his claims of
1313000	1318120	a reverse-engineered triangular alien reproduction vehicle with little in the way of physical
1318120	1319120	proof.
1319120	1324960	However, his disclosures have led to incredibly actionable intelligence and worthwhile investigation.
1324960	1332240	In his 1998 IUFOC, International UFO Congress Presentation, Fouchet presented comprehensive
1332240	1339960	disclosures of TR-3B, Area 51, NSA's Men in Black Treat, EG&G, and Project Red Light,
1339960	1343960	as well as the DARCE Defense Advanced Research Center which I have talked about numerous
1343960	1345520	times on this channel.
1345520	1350680	In the presentation, Fouchet made mention to a source informing him beginning in 1992
1350680	1356480	the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to massive public attention on Area 51.
1356480	1362120	This would see the majority of exotic Air Force platforms relocated to Utah, Colorado,
1362120	1367240	Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia, and south of Area 51 to S-4.
1367240	1373360	And there is evidence to show a heavy focus on Area 51 and UFO programs in the early 1990s
1373360	1378040	which may in fact have seen projects moved out of Area 51 Groom Lake.
1378040	1383780	In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least 8 black programs
1383780	1389420	flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional
1389420	1390820	technologies.
1390820	1395340	An unnamed source Goodall knew for 12 years stationed at Groom Lake later explained that
1395340	1401540	UAP positively existed at the base while another source stated, quote, we have things out there
1401540	1406260	that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in
1406260	1408060	the movies, end quote.
1408060	1414220	Programs of Area 51 moving clandestine operations to Dugway were additionally made by one A.H.
1414220	1419740	A.H claimed to be a former Boeing employee who leveraged significant knowledge on UFO
1419740	1427020	legacy programs from friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, ONI, NRO, Area 51, the Air Force
1427020	1429500	Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and others.
1429500	1435100	A.H appeared as a primary witness on Stephen Greer's 2001 excellent disclosure briefing
1435100	1439120	document and had his testimony taped in the year 2000.
1439120	1444260	Now it's worth noting as I discussed in the Northrop project, A.H is likely a primary
1444260	1450380	source of information for Dr. Stephen Greer, similar to UFO researcher William Hamilton.
1450380	1456940	As A.H has been in contact with Greer for decades, and Greer repeats much of what A.H has stated
1456940	1458440	in the past.
1458440	1464540	Greer talks often of Dugway as a primary UFO legacy program site, discussing a Utah underground
1464540	1469780	complex south of Salt Lake City accessible only by air in the 2001 disclosure briefing
1469780	1473220	document and again in a 2016 presentation.
1473220	1477900	In this 26 presentation, Greer discussed Black program locations and codenames which
1477900	1480260	relate to the testimony of Ed.
1480260	1486260	In this discussion, Greer tags Dugway as quote, the most critical one, end quote, when discussing
1486260	1488100	Black program facilities.
1489020	1493500	And in Utah, one of the most critical, and this is the most critical one that's new,
1493500	1499900	is the Dugway proving grounds outside of Provo, and this is classified air space above and
1499900	1502220	no access by ground.
1502220	1506500	Above ground, you don't see much and everything is underground.
1506500	1512300	Richard Foch, this Naval Research Labs official, was out there with some generation five or
1512300	1515940	six or whatever night scopes doing an operation.
1515940	1520780	When he looked out and he saw these objects coming out from underground that then zipped
1520780	1526380	over and that were these massive disk and triangular shape anti-gravity objects that
1526380	1527380	were ours.
1527380	1530140	And some were just sitting out there watching him.
1530140	1533380	And that's outside of Provo out in the desert.
1533380	1538780	It is not inconceivable many of Greer's early ideas on Dugway were disclosed to him by witness
1538780	1539980	A.H.
1540020	1546180	After all, in 2000, A.H. did in fact reference an underground Utah installation southwest
1546180	1552180	of Salt Lake City accessible only by air that tests and maintains extraterrestrial technology.
1552180	1558540	We're incorporating this technology from this craft that the Area 51 and I also found out
1558540	1565500	that they are moving a lot of the personnel and some of the equipment and some of the
1565500	1574020	extraterrestrial technology equipment and the craft to base up in Utah.
1574020	1575020	Is it right?
1575020	1583020	And they move very 50 most stuff from Area 51 at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.
1583020	1589260	However, we can find some extremely interesting pre 2000s discussion of Dugway by Greer.
1589260	1595620	See on screen now a March 1998 email exchange with Greer and UFO investigator Steve Jones.
1595620	1602820	Yes, the same investigator we discussed above with the alleged 1953 Garrison Utah UFO crash.
1602820	1607460	In these initial exchanges, Jones details his field notes while near the Desert Range
1607460	1611020	experimental station studying the retrieval case.
1611020	1615420	Jones mentioned he had learned that work from Area 51 Groom Lake had indeed been moved to
1615420	1619900	Dugway in an area called Dog west of the main gate.
1619900	1624820	Jones himself had collected data since the 1980s on tarped trucks left in the middle
1624820	1626660	of nowhere in Utah.
1626660	1631540	These truckloads were left between Hill Air Force Base north of Salt Lake and Wendover
1631540	1633820	Utah bordering Nevada.
1633820	1639540	This between area is of course Dugway and the Utah test and training range.
1639540	1644780	Recall also that Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share air strips in the UTTR.
1644780	1650980	Hill itself and its 388th range squadron operate on the Dugway-Michael Army airfield.
1650980	1657660	What is more intriguing to me is an even earlier 1996 exchange of emails between Greer and
1657660	1665740	one AJ Kradock with the subject line quote, Area 51, insiders say area southwest of Tawilla,
1665740	1672780	Utah deserve a look and quote, AJ aka Tony Kradock once did work with Greer serving as
1672780	1675860	webmaster for csetty.org.
1675860	1682700	Kradock is also the founder and CEO of Kradock, an oil and gas service provider in Libya.
1682700	1688540	Why did a CEO with 40 years experience in the international petroleum industry engage
1688540	1691740	in UFO research with Greer in the 90s?
1691740	1696540	Anyways, in this email address to Greer, Kradock links a discussion with an insider
1696540	1697740	source.
1697740	1702940	The sender or insider had their credentials withheld but claimed to work on several sites,
1702940	1707460	checking badges and running ground surveillance equipment, tremor sensors, ground surveillance
1707460	1709100	radar, etc.
1709100	1715540	The source additionally discussed EMP weaponry that could fry vehicle computers or electronics.
1715540	1720380	We live in a world where EMP devices are often discussed as legacy program weapons to shoot
1720380	1724200	down non-human craft, so this inclusion is interesting.
1724200	1729480	The source claims Kradock and others, implying Greer, were looking in two obvious directions
1729480	1731560	for UAP programs.
1731560	1736800	Although Area 51 did indeed have legacy programs, the source advised Kradock to look in the
1736800	1742200	state of Utah to the southwest of Tawilla County and west of Salt Lake City.
1742200	1747440	In this described area existed nine exclusion zones, four of which featured underground
1747440	1752080	locations and this area, of course, is dugway-proving ground.
1752080	1756640	The Kradock-Greer connection here is fascinating and well worth exploring more.
1756640	1762320	However, remember this discussion of dugway, Area 51, and mysterious programs took place
1762320	1769600	before the 1997 Popular Mechanics article on the new Area 51, Fuchet's Disclosures,
1769600	1772160	and A.H.'s film testimony.
1772160	1776760	Very pertinent, this insider source claimed to have knowledge of dugway-proving ground
1776760	1785840	and UFO legacy programs before any public exposure.
1785840	1791280	In June of 2023, the contentious Stephen Greer held his first whistleblower symposium at
1791280	1794580	the National Press Club since his 2001 panel.
1794580	1799600	That featured the legendary Mark McCandillish amongst other first-hand witnesses.
1799600	1804280	Viewers may remember this panel as featuring the first public disclosures of Michael Herrera,
1804280	1808520	and we now know UFO whistleblower Jake Barber was in attendance.
1808520	1813940	One witness featured was not present at the event and had his story told by Greer.
1813940	1817160	This was a witness known by the pseudonym MS.
1817160	1818680	So there's another gentleman.
1818680	1820240	I'm going to run through these very quickly.
1820240	1822240	We'd be here for 30 hours if I didn't.
1822240	1825520	I'm just giving you a tip of the iceberg, right?
1825520	1831600	This is a guy who is at the dugway-proving grounds for a key facility, MS, we call him.
1831600	1838960	He was a work for C. Martin Corporation contractor, and he was in a facility that had an extraterrestrial
1838960	1842040	vehicle that was being studied by scientists.
1842040	1844240	He knows the chief scientist involved.
1844240	1849040	He has named that individual to us, and they can all be subpoenaed now.
1849040	1852520	So this object was there in 2009.
1852520	1857280	He didn't know the date of acquisition, but he thought it was fairly recent.
1857280	1858280	Next.
1858280	1864000	He also was read into and had the chief scientist show him the location which we now have of
1864000	1870720	a dumb, deep underground military base that is in the dugway sector, so-called Avery Sector
1870720	1875400	A-V-E-R-Y, and it has huge capacity for parking.
1875400	1880440	You go in and there's a vast underground complex in that location.
1880440	1884560	That location has been handed off to investigators with the U.S. government.
1884560	1885720	Next.
1885720	1887920	This gives an illustration of the size of this.
1887920	1892040	You could put easily on the platform that goes down the Air Force One.
1892040	1895800	It's a very large elevator goes down underground.
1895800	1902320	Upon release of the DPI archive, I investigated all files relating to this fascinating case.
1902320	1907120	Files on MS can be found under witness ID 10655.
1907120	1912320	Due to lapses in site security and data presented in the documents, I was able to track down
1912320	1917280	witness MS and hear his incredible encounter at Dugway firsthand.
1917280	1922920	Investors of my channel may recall an interview with MS in UFO Witness' redacted list.
1922920	1927800	This project was deleted to respect the privacy of other witnesses covered in the project,
1927800	1928800	however.
1928800	1933320	I would now like to revisit the testimony of MS with exponentially greater focus on his
1933320	1934320	claims.
1934320	1939040	The purpose of this investigation will be to identify specific buildings and military
1939040	1944560	units operating UFO legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground as well as explore any and
1944560	1949760	all evidence to the enormous facility likely beneath the ground of the Utah site.
1949760	1954120	And before we get started, I would like to add MS was approached by elements of the Senate
1954120	1959040	Select Committee on Intelligence to testify regarding his claims and I can confirm this
1959040	1962080	as he shared with me the screenshots of their outreach.
1962080	1967200	MS turned down the requests as he is a current railroad employee and was unable to break
1967200	1972280	away from work for a week plus even when SSCI offered to pay for his travel.
1972320	1977880	I have a tremendous amount of respect for MS and find great value in researching his
1977880	1979280	testimony.
1979280	1983600	Witness MS served in the U.S. Navy and was even stationed in the auxiliary division
1983600	1988120	of the USS Teddy Roosevelt from 1990 to 2000.
1988120	1991840	Following his service, MS entered into government contracting work.
1991840	1997800	From 2009 to 2013, he worked as a maintenance painter and sign technician for the C. Martin
1997800	1998800	Company.
1998800	2003640	C. Martin is a DOD contractor whose mission is to, quote, provide a fine-tuned approach
2003640	2008720	to managing people, time and resources to provide quality services while creating value
2008720	2010640	for our customers, end quote.
2010640	2016160	C. Martin operates as a prime subcontractor with DOD in myriad capacities, specializing
2016160	2021560	in facility operations and maintenance, logistics, construction, range operation and maintenance,
2021560	2022560	etc.
2022560	2027280	And C. Martin does indeed have a location on Dugway located near the administration
2027280	2028280	center.
2028280	2032960	C. Martin's range and facility, operations and maintenance contracting pertains greatly
2032960	2038440	to areas of interest for this investigation, specifically for Avery Technical Center, which
2038440	2043800	resides on Michael Army Airfield shared with Hill Air Force Base in the 388th Range Squadron
2043800	2048360	as well as locations a stone throw away called Ditto Technical Center.
2048360	2053720	Ditto contains the heart of the West Desert Test Center, which alongside ATEC tests chemicals
2053720	2057360	and biological weapons across the Utah range.
2057360	2062680	In fact, the Army Test and Evaluation Command Major Range and Facility Base West Desert
2062680	2068160	Test Center is majorly funded by the Joint Services Chemical and Biological Defense Program
2068160	2075360	CBDP, a lot of acronyms I know, but remember the term CBDP as we will discuss it again
2075360	2081160	both in relation to a specific contractor of interest at Dugway and for MS's story.
2081160	2087040	Now MS's experience begins in 2009, four months into his work for C. Martin at Dugway.
2087040	2092840	MS held a level 5 proximity badge, which allowed him access to myriad facilities across Dugway
2092840	2095640	to perform DOD contractor work.
2095640	2100720	And crucial to note, MS did not have a security clearance even though he occasionally states
2100720	2103480	level 5 clearance instead of badge.
2103480	2109160	MS would often ride into Dugway Proving Ground from Caysville, Utah in a van where all other
2109160	2112200	travelers held top secret clearance.
2112200	2117080	On normal day on the job, MS was tasked with electrical meter reading to allow the U.S.
2117080	2121000	government to bill various contractors working on site.
2121000	2127920	In 2009 is when it happened, I was about four months into working there.
2127920	2133040	There was a kid that was underneath me as my apprentice because I was one of the maintenance
2133040	2134040	painters.
2134040	2140920	We took care of every facility out there and so he called in sick one day.
2140920	2145200	I had to go read beaders for him because that's what they do.
2145200	2154440	So the government is in control of about 48% of that and then 52% of it is private contractor
2154440	2156920	and that's why they don't have to disclose anything.
2156920	2163520	So I had to go out read his meter that day to get everything turned in to the government
2163520	2166560	and I can't remember how many facilities there were.
2166560	2175520	Probably a good 15 but those 15 took me to places where I've never really been out there
2175520	2182000	and opened my eyes up to a lot of different things.
2182000	2187840	This led MS to the Avery Technical Center where he entered into the quote unquote ghost building,
2187840	2191560	a building nicknamed for having no numbers and no insignia.
2191560	2196680	Initially, I believed these facilities may be the material test facility or defensive
2196680	2201800	test chamber just south of Avery across the road from Ditto Technical Center.
2201800	2207360	After all, MS will soon describe the incident location as a clean room of sorts and these
2207360	2214080	two facilities are high profile CBDP test areas on site at the West Desert Test Center.
2214080	2218920	However, these installations are well known and indeed named and numbered.
2218920	2224360	On the other hand, Avery Technical Center yields very few search results and quite often
2224360	2228720	does not appear in numerous U.S. Army and ATEC documents.
2228720	2234280	In fact, Avery is curiously missing from DPG visitor guides while other areas of interest
2234280	2237080	such as Ditto are clearly mentioned.
2237080	2241960	Last time I covered MS's testimony, I had very little to work off regarding Avery,
2241960	2248840	bar a September 2017 DTTF facility description document and image from Facebook.
2248840	2255400	Before we investigate Avery, I must clearly state I am not revealing any classified information.
2255400	2261120	All locations and installations to be discussed can be referenced in public domain materials.
2261120	2266760	Let's reference a July 2012 unclassified report titled Environmental Assessment of
2266760	2272000	the Continued Exclusive Use of Department of the Army Land Located at U.S. Army Dugway
2272000	2278120	Proving Ground by members of the U.S. Air Force that offers incredible insights and exploration
2278120	2280040	into Avery Technical Center.
2280040	2285120	As mentioned numerous times so far, Avery borders Michael Army airfield and both the
2285120	2291440	airfield and 40 acre Avery area are the focus of the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby
2291440	2293520	Hill Air Force Base.
2293520	2298120	Avery partly serves as air testing slash training for the 388th.
2298120	2303120	Historically, Avery had conducted numerous radiological studies and investigations into
2303120	2308760	the handling of radioactive material, including utilizing the Radiobiological Warfare Laboratories
2308760	2311080	for the Atomic Energy Commission.
2311080	2317080	Avery employs an internal rail system for the transportation of radioactive materials.
2317080	2322280	This mention of an internal rail system is truly massive as we further on investigate
2322280	2326000	Dugway's alleged deep underground military base.
2326000	2331200	Aerial views of Avery yield no building descriptions unlike the nearby Ditto area where facilities
2331200	2335080	like the Diner, Contractor Jacobs, etc. are mentioned.
2335080	2340200	However, this Environmental Assessment document offers us a gorgeous detailed overview of
2340200	2343520	Avery locations see on screen now.
2343520	2349320	Locations of interest include the 10-02 Avery Tunnel Entrance, 10-12 Photo Operations and
2349320	2354920	Maintenance, 10-38 General Storage, and 10-16 Classified Storage.
2354920	2360680	Now other buildings outside of this map not marked developed slash unclassified exist.
2360680	2367400	However, I am willing to bet this experience took place at Building 10-10 Test Operations.
2367400	2372360	But enough investigation, let's hear from MS as he entered this ghost building.
2372800	2377400	I walked into one that they called the ghost building because it just kind of came out
2377400	2378400	of nowhere.
2378400	2380880	No numbers on it, no nothing.
2380880	2387920	And opened up the door and basically had a M16 stuck in my chest and I had my level
2387920	2388920	5 badge on.
2388920	2393880	I think that was the only thing that saved my tail that day.
2393880	2400160	And there were what I call white coats, you know, they're kind of like doctors type set
2400200	2405960	up inside the building, kind of like a little clean room area.
2405960	2410560	And you know, I'm sure I don't know if you've ever been in a car accident or not, but when
2410560	2417320	you you have your life kind of flashed before your eyes, everything starts to slow down
2417320	2422560	and you start really taking in a lot of information very quickly.
2422560	2428040	And so that's that's what I, you know, what happened to me is with with the gun and everything
2428040	2434760	else that just kind of everything just started started to fall into place.
2434760	2441320	That thing was on its own power when I hovered, there was there's kind of a I don't know
2441320	2449600	if you've seen the rendering or not, yes, the door, there was no door just kind of open
2449600	2456480	on the bottom, but everything is just kind of just walking there on its own power.
2456480	2463520	I don't always know anything, but the white coats walk around and analyze and do all their
2463520	2464520	stuff.
2464520	2465520	I don't know.
2465520	2472720	There's, you know, a few gift armed guards in there at the time and I like I said, I don't
2472720	2478840	know if they were getting ready to move or, you know, what have you quickly before we
2478840	2484360	discussed this incredible craft, who were these armed guards that held MS at gunpoint?
2484360	2490040	While numerous US facilities actually contract security personnel instead of enlisted men,
2490040	2492360	this is done through sole source contracts.
2492360	2498200	A contract method Dr. Eric Davis has stated is used for UAP legacy programs.
2498200	2503520	These contracts were given to private security companies post 9 11 to bolster US Army and
2503520	2506040	other military installation security.
2506040	2511480	I have found a 2006 General Accounting Office report titled, quote, Army's Guard program
2511480	2516360	requires greater oversight and reassessment of acquisition approach, end quote.
2516360	2520960	This document discusses all contracted security personnel issued by the Army.
2520960	2525040	Dugway Proving Ground utilize Chenega integrated systems.
2525040	2530280	In future projects, I will be interested in exploring both Chenega and their subcontractor,
2530280	2532960	Vance Federal Security Services.
2532960	2537680	Wackenhut Services, which Admiral Bobby Ray Inman was formerly a board member of, is a
2537680	2543960	private security corporation I highly suspect was involved in UAP legacy program security.
2543960	2549680	Wackenhut, like Vance Federal Security Systems, were used as subcontractors to Army installation,
2549680	2551800	not primary contractors.
2551800	2556360	Now, unless contractor security personnel were highly cleared security specialists,
2556360	2561040	I highly doubt these private security companies could do more than scan vehicles and check
2561040	2564200	badges for access to legacy program sites.
2564320	2569720	Therefore, while I do reckon security services like Wackenhut and possibly Chenega have historically
2569720	2575880	performed installation and access security for UAP legacy program locations, I must conclude
2575880	2582840	the armed guards within proximity to the saucer were known as industrial security, Indusec personnel.
2582840	2585240	Now, why that conclusion?
2585240	2588920	Industrial security, quote, conducts risk management activities with respect to the
2588920	2594160	US government's defense industrial base, including critical technologies and the defense
2594160	2599680	supply chain through oversight of the national industrial security program, issuance of facility
2599680	2605160	security clearances, foreign ownership control and influence mitigation measures, information
2605160	2610160	system cyber security oversight and other activities related to protecting classified
2610160	2615920	and controlled unclassified national security information and related technology, end quote.
2615920	2622840	See on screen now an ATEC security specialist role for Dugway detailing an Indusec position.
2622840	2626920	These responsibilities are listed for this role, including one such task, which is to
2626920	2632680	provide backup as the alternate special security officer for sensitive compartmented information
2632680	2634600	SEI programs.
2634600	2640240	Moving forward, investigating industrial security alongside UAP legacy program installations
2640240	2642520	will be paramount to my research.
2642520	2648840	Anyways, MS observed a saucer, roughly 10 feet tall and 20 feet in circumference.
2648840	2652360	The craft was hovering 10 to 12 inches off the ground.
2652360	2657680	The disc had no seams or fasteners and appeared to be made out of one piece and featured a
2657680	2660000	brushed metal appearance.
2660000	2662520	Around the craft were six lab technicians.
2662520	2668840	I believe these to be ATEC and Battelle Memorial Institute scientists, and more on this later.
2668840	2673200	MS believed this craft was in the process of being dismantled due to a bottom section
2673200	2677160	of the saucer being removed featuring a conical structure.
2677160	2682360	This conical section appeared to be floating and was almost independent of the craft.
2682360	2687680	One cannot help but draw parallels to Bob Lazar's drawn extraterrestrial reactor model
2687680	2693000	that he claimed served as the propulsion mechanism for the sports model flying saucer.
2693000	2699240	Appearing by the craft was a flat screen television type of electronic, displaying a mapping system.
2700240	2706120	Yeah, there is nothing on it, not a seam, not anything almost like it was like just casted.
2706120	2711400	Yeah, like if you said it 3D printed, but yeah, it's flawless is what I can say.
2711400	2718600	It's not that you, like nowadays, there's no way to replicate it for us.
2718600	2722720	I don't know if they were going to get ready to move it or whatever, but they had it broke down.
2722720	2724000	A lot of it was broke down.
2724000	2730320	That bottom section was open where you could kind of see into that component area.
2730320	2737360	That triangle, it's like it's floating, like it's generating a power.
2737360	2746520	I don't know, like a lot of everything happened very, very quickly and just trying to take in everything as fast as I could.
2746520	2751840	That section is basically doing its own thing.
2751880	2759760	When I stand in, I don't know if you're careless with something or just, that's what I said.
2759760	2767400	Is it in transition to where it's like, you guys have it out in this building out in the middle of nowhere,
2767400	2772920	but then you have military vehicles around, you have regular civilian vehicles around,
2772920	2778440	but if this thing's on its own power doing its own thing, what are you guys going to be doing with it?
2778440	2784840	You guys going to move it underground, more stuff going on, or if you've taken what you wanted.
2784840	2790040	MS was taken by the guards to the nearby Ditto Technical Center to the Garrison building
2790040	2794240	where two men in civilian clothing immediately began interrogating him.
2794240	2800120	The men were clad in black suits and MS guessed these individuals to be FBI or CIA.
2800120	2806080	Quite possibly, these men could also be the infamous alleged NSA men in black treat.
2806160	2809720	For six hours, MS was harassed and interrogated.
2809720	2815560	The entire duration MS maintained he had no idea what he saw and he was just doing his job.
2815560	2817480	Eventually, he was let go.
2817480	2820360	I didn't say a word of these guys when they sat me down.
2820360	2823080	So I don't know if they knew that I saw something.
2823080	2824880	I don't know how they, you know what I mean?
2824880	2829760	But we, I still worked out there, so I still had a confidential agreement with them.
2829760	2833520	I still had all that, but I don't know where it would stand nowadays.
2833600	2838000	In the months and years following the incident, MS would discuss his encounter with family
2838000	2841120	and friends and ask around to find more.
2841120	2846800	MS reached out to various individuals affiliated with Dugway, including one such person.
2846800	2852440	MS stated, quote, I reached out to him and got him to talk about my situation by accident,
2852440	2853200	end quote.
2853200	2860400	This individual, pseudonym GP, worked in legacy operations at Dugway and possibly still does today.
2860400	2866560	GP was a senior chemist involved in Dugway's UAP legacy programs, both above ground and
2866560	2871520	in the subterranean facility, where he claimed a light rail system connected the Dugway
2871520	2874480	Dumb to numerous others around the country.
2874480	2877200	GP commented little about himself.
2877200	2880960	He primarily discussed with MS what he went through at Avery.
2880960	2887120	What we do know about GP according to MS is he is a DOD chemist by degree and was moved
2888080	2892320	after being promoted to work in UAP legacy programs.
2892320	2898080	MS lost connection with GP when he left C Martin in 2014, but we are attempting to get
2898080	2900080	in contact with him today.
2900080	2905120	Often when discussing legacy program operations, we discuss research and development.
2905120	2910960	Engineers, physicists, military brass, the discussion of a chemist is indeed intriguing.
2910960	2916000	However, high level DOD chemists involved with technologies of unknown origin would most
2916000	2921920	certainly be stationed at Dugway, the nation's premier chemical and biological testing facility.
2921920	2924720	What exactly did GP do at Dugway?
2924720	2929760	This is unknown, but speculating possibly his position could have seen him operating with
2929760	2933280	chemistry concepts surrounding the craft's propulsion system.
2933280	2939600	Analyzing biologics, studying metallurgy, the list is truly endless, but GP did have enough
2939600	2944160	knowledge to inform MS of the mapping system he saw near the craft.
2944160	2949440	And you'd almost have coordinates on there is what I can describe.
2949440	2954480	So the way that that's set up to me is what it looked like in mapping system.
2954480	2959120	When I talked to the gentleman that was over top of a lot of that stuff out there,
2960880	2970240	he said they're basically able to put on that system two points of references or whatever
2970240	2975040	they're going to do on reference points and basically generate a wormhole and drop through.
2975680	2983040	And so that's where he says that interstellar travel is how they get from point A to point B
2983040	2983920	so quickly.
2983920	2990080	In short, GP stated the craft was extraterrestrial and operated via gravity displacement but
2990080	2991680	wouldn't come at further.
2991680	2998080	Now MS received confirmation from both GP and a current railroad co-worker of a massive
2998080	3000560	underground facility beneath Dugway.
3000560	3006400	The co-worker even claimed to have assisted in digging out the tunneling system beneath DPG.
3006400	3011040	MS and myself are currently setting up time to meet with this individual as well.
3011040	3017760	Deep underground military bases, DUMs, aka subterranean facilities or STFs are a keen
3017760	3022240	interest of mine, especially in relation to UAP legacy programs.
3022320	3024800	DUMs do indeed exist.
3024800	3030000	Quite often planned as underground ICBM facilities, underground command bunkers,
3030000	3034560	corporate facilities or COG continuity of government installations.
3034560	3038960	Indeed, even deep underground tunnel systems have been planned to connect these facilities
3038960	3041440	like in studies conducted by TRW.
3041440	3046480	Massive machines called tunnel boring machines and nuclear subterranes have historically been
3046480	3049760	associated with such intriguing underground work.
3049760	3054480	In fact, the United States National Research Council has historically published special
3054480	3060880	projects on the creation of DUMs, such as this 1981 and 1982 workshop on technology for
3060880	3064960	the design and construction of deep underground defense facilities.
3064960	3070400	DUMs are not our focus today besides under Dugway, but again, I have discussed such
3070400	3075120	underground facilities before and plan to tackle the subject fully in the future.
3075120	3079200	For now I'll leave you with numerous underground tunnel systems in western states
3079200	3082160	detailed by the US Bureau of Reclamation.
3082160	3087120	Many tunnel systems listed in this report feature tunnel distances of tens of thousands
3087120	3093040	of feet of length, tens of feet of diameter covered by hundreds or thousands of feet of earth.
3093040	3098400	Now many such tunnels serve as waterways and aqueducts, however it is fascinating to see
3098400	3101520	such a volume of massive underground tunnels.
3101520	3105760	It is critical to mention the Bureau of Reclamation was one of the key members
3105760	3112400	on the 1981 and 1982 joint project discussing deep underground defense facilities we mentioned above.
3113200	3119600	GP would state this underground facility at an undisclosed depth spanned 1300 square miles,
3119600	3122640	which is the size of Dugway proving ground itself.
3122640	3126800	The tunnels connecting Dugway to other underground installations were wide enough to
3126800	3130240	transport enormous aircraft such as a 747.
3130240	3136320	These rail systems operated off of magnetics, popularly referred to as maglev trains.
3136960	3141840	It's 1300 square miles underneath and then there's a light rail system is what he said.
3141840	3147280	He goes that light rail system is connected to every base in the nation and can transport the
3147280	3152480	president's plane basically anywhere they need to without putting it in the air.
3152480	3158320	Maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetics rather than employing wheels.
3158320	3164000	Maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad systems including higher speeds,
3164000	3169280	superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, improved gradient handling
3169280	3174160	and lower noise, but are much more expensive compared to traditional systems.
3174160	3179280	Maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour.
3179280	3184880	Now the implementation of maglev train systems connecting dumps is often seen as conspiracy.
3184880	3187600	However, this is an incorrect assumption.
3187600	3193600	In 1986, FFRDC Los Alamos National Labs published a study titled, quote,
3193600	3199120	sub saline, a nuclear powered melt tunneling concept for high speed lunar subsurface
3199120	3200960	transportation tunnels, end quote.
3200960	3206000	The intriguing study discussed the creation of subsurface lunar tunnels connecting manned
3206000	3211680	installations that would feature maglev or other high speed train transportation systems.
3211680	3217280	And while discussing specifics of the dump, I must once again state I am not releasing
3217280	3218960	any classified information.
3218960	3222880	Everything discussed from here on out is all public domain.
3222880	3228000	The entrance to the subterranean facility is accessible from a tiny building in the middle
3228000	3231520	of the West Desert Test Center near German Village, Dugway.
3231520	3237600	According to GP, the entrance is solely an elevator to take personnel to the installation.
3237600	3244960	This entrance does not supply the Dugway Dumb with materials, food, supplies, logistics, etc.
3244960	3250000	Instead, the Dumb is internally supplied from tunnels connecting the base to other subterranean
3250000	3251040	facilities.
3251040	3256880	When I last discussed MS and UFO witnesses redacted list, I did not cover the supposed
3256880	3259840	entrance to the Dugway subterranean facility.
3259840	3265200	Since covering MS's story, Stephen Greer has taken it upon himself to leak this supposed
3265200	3266640	entrance himself.
3266640	3273360	See on screen now the critical update displaying the Dugway Dumb entrance on the DPI archive.
3273360	3278400	As mentioned above, this remote entrance is indeed on Dugway's West Desert Test Center
3278400	3283840	and is quite close to the Avery Technical Center and Michael Army Airfield, while lying
3283840	3288960	between properties considered as Air Force lease rentals on Dugway-proving ground.
3288960	3294000	Analyzing Google Earth historical imagery, it appears this entrance was constructed sometime
3294000	3297200	between 1993 and 2006.
3297200	3302000	It could however be much older, as satellite resolution does not allow us to see clearly
3302000	3303440	at these older dates.
3303440	3309040	According to GP, much of the Dugway Dumb operations reside under nearby Granite Peak,
3309040	3314160	which sits just west of the alleged entrance in Avery and Ditto areas.
3314160	3318800	What is quite interesting to me is the fact that 388th Range Squadron out of Hill and
3318800	3323440	Michael Army Airfield runs multiple sites on and just north of the mountain.
3323440	3328080	I'd like to focus specifically on the Mini-Mute stations 10 and 2.
3328080	3333360	Mini-Mutes are threat emitter systems commonly utilized to train pilots to recognize and
3333360	3336080	respond to various enemy radar threats.
3336080	3341280	One must wonder if the Granite Peak South Station has entrances to or interactions
3341280	3344160	with a supposed facility under the mountain.
3344160	3349600	MS's disclosures are truly astonishing, and I must preface I am speculating here,
3349600	3354320	but from MS's testimony, a strong thesis can be extracted.
3354320	3362000	MS stumbled upon a joint army and USAF MRTFB UFO Legacy operation operating between ATEC
3362000	3367920	and the 388th Range Squadron, with the aid of white coat contractors such as Battelle Memorial
3367920	3371200	Institute and Jacob Solutions, more on them later.
3371200	3375200	This program operates above and beneath Dugway Proving Ground.
3375200	3380240	The clandestine program utilizes the Avery Technical Center's internal rail system
3380240	3385760	to transport non-human craft and materials onto unmarked secretive Avery buildings such as the
3385760	3389040	test operations and classified storage buildings.
3389040	3394640	Program scientists and the 388th Range Squadron utilize the southern part of the Utah test
3394640	3399760	and training range to test extraterrestrial vehicles or alien reproduction vehicles.
3399760	3404960	This would operate similarly to what witness Ed described with the joint UFO reverse engineering
3404960	3409840	program between the Edwards 412 test wing and Nevada test and training range.
3409840	3415600	The program also utilizes top chemistry and biology subject matter experts from ATEC and
3415600	3421520	DPG's chemical and biological defense program to either study biologics or engage with any
3421520	3424160	relevant aspects of non-human craft.
3424160	3429680	The Dugway DUM communicates and operates alongside other DUM locations across the continental
3429680	3436960	United States, likely hidden within and below major military installations and MRTFBs.
3436960	3442080	A truly incredible thesis, but one that can be reasonably constructed based upon the testimony
3442080	3444800	of MS in study of Dugway Proving Ground.
3450080	3454480	Lastly, I just want to briefly touch on some contractor operations at Dugway.
3454480	3460160	Remember, MS claimed over half of Dugway's operations related to contracting work.
3460240	3467360	In fiscal year 2013, according to the GAO, Dugway's West Desert test range saw about 77%
3467360	3473920	of acknowledged work conducted for the CBDP, Chemical Biological Defense Program Enterprise.
3473920	3480480	Now, what contractor might come to mind that deals in depth with chemical and biological concepts?
3480480	3483520	That's right, Battelle Memorial Institute.
3483520	3487920	I have covered Battelle at length before, including their project STORC, which was
3487920	3493280	tasked by USG to study UAP, parallel but independent to Project Blue Book.
3493280	3498000	I have also investigated Battelle and their curious links to nickel titanium alloys,
3498000	3504400	which may just have been the shape memory alloy recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash.
3504400	3507040	I highly recommend viewing that project.
3507040	3512320	Battelle runs a host of biochem facilities, including the Battelle National Biodefense
3512320	3514800	Institute at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
3514800	3519760	This location has recently become entwined with UFO lore as a possible location where
3519760	3522160	non-human biologics are stored.
3522160	3527840	There is additionally now the alleged infamous exobiospheric organism molecular biologist
3527840	3531680	Reddit whistleblower testimony focused on this Battelle location.
3531680	3536720	But these claims are absent from this investigation as they require much more research.
3536720	3539200	To add further intrigue, at Fort Detrick,
3539200	3543520	Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,
3543520	3546880	FFRDC, for the Department of Homeland Security.
3546880	3551440	Specifically, the DHS, Undersecretary for Science and Technology.
3551440	3555520	I would once again like to draw attention to a primary thesis of this channel that
3555520	3560080	FFRDC and UARC often act as project managers,
3560080	3567920	serving as subject matter experts performing R&D work in joint USG and contractor UAP legacy programs.
3567920	3572400	And remember how we previously discussed the CBDP programs at Dugway.
3572400	3578480	While analyzing this joint multinational and interagency CBDP Test and Evaluation
3578480	3584800	Partners chart, we can see Dugway and Battelle are both listed as select few program locations.
3584800	3589120	In fact, the West Desert Test Center and Fort Detrick's National Interagency
3589120	3593760	Biodefense Campus at which Battelle operates are additionally quite intimate,
3593760	3600480	serving as two of four of CBDP's primary research and development and test and evaluation facilities.
3600480	3605280	Now, I know that's a lot, but Battelle has historically also worked closely with Dugway,
3605280	3611760	including operating the Chemical and Biological Defense Information Analysis Center, CBIC,
3611760	3617120	that operates at Dugway. According to excellent UFO researcher Anthony Bregalia,
3617120	3622400	Battelle additionally has a design slash build division with capabilities for creating laboratories
3622400	3628320	and other specialized facilities. In one article, Bregalia referenced multiple open source documents
3628320	3632800	that discussed Battelle's facility design and construction management work at Dugway.
3632800	3637680	According to these documents, Battelle has engineered enclosed testing facilities and sealed
3637680	3641680	structures at DPG that according to one technical report, quote,
3641680	3647040	meet stringent containment standards, providing a degree of protection that has never been achieved
3647040	3653120	before, end quote. Battelle's facility design services also include specialized locations such as
3653120	3658720	clean rooms. I must reference back to the testimony of MS and the clean room that held the UFO.
3658720	3663840	Perhaps a full investigation into Battelle's construction work at DPG is warranted.
3663840	3668640	DPG and Fort Detrick's connections with each other and Battelle are quite interesting,
3668640	3674240	but this is where things get downright strange. The director of Dugway's West Desert Test Center
3674240	3680720	is one Mr. Ryan W. Harris. Harris is, quote, responsible for the overall planning, directing,
3680720	3686080	and evaluating all aspects of work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition
3686080	3691440	test and training programs executed by the test center, end quote. Harris received a bachelor's
3691440	3697120	in chemical engineering and served in the army as a chemical officer. In the year 2000, Harris
3697120	3702560	would accept a project manager position working with Battelle at Dugway. This Battelle work saw
3702560	3708160	Harris overseeing several testing and training programs, and in 2004, Harris would accept a
3708160	3714000	project manager position with Dugway and work his way all the way up the ranks until 2012,
3714000	3720240	where he achieved the position as WTC test director, where he now evaluates all aspects of
3720240	3726240	the work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition test and training programs executed
3726240	3732240	by the test center. Interesting how a Battelle project manager becomes director of an MRTFB
3732240	3738240	where witnesses have claimed a UAP legacy program employing DOD chemists takes place.
3738240	3744000	But we don't stop there. Meet US Army chemical engineering core member Greg Frank. Frank served
3744000	3750320	as a chemist for the chemical laboratory division at Dugway Proving Ground from 1984 to 1985,
3750320	3755040	quote. He directed and performed chemical studies and developed procedures for chemical
3755040	3760800	testing and analysis utilizing modern analytical instrumentation, end quote. While serving as
3760800	3765920	test officer, Frank would branch out into numerous vehicle and chemical munition programs,
3765920	3772160	developing material test plans and test operational plans. When he left service in 1985,
3772160	3776880	Frank joined Battelle as a project manager and principal investigator where he, quote,
3776880	3782080	managed both the technical and financial aspects of numerous projects in the areas of chemical
3782080	3788880	and biological defense, end quote. As of 2008, Frank operated as executive vice president for Battelle
3788880	3794960	Science and Technology International and is responsible for over 5,000 scientists, engineers,
3794960	3799840	and supporting staff. But believe it or not, these are not the only connections we can make with
3799840	3806880	WDTC leadership and Battelle. We can also take a keen look at Anders Weiborg, former director of
3806880	3812800	Special Programs Division at the West Desert Test Center. Now working for the DOE, Weiborg once
3812800	3818720	served at Dugway, ensuring execution of daily operations within the test center. Before working
3818720	3824640	at Dugway, Weiborg worked at Battelle, serving as a test director responsible for TNE of chemical
3824640	3830400	and biological defense equipment. Battelle and Dugway share intimate connections, likely myriad
3830400	3835760	more than we have just scratched today. Other contractors at Dugway are of extreme interest
3835760	3841440	as well and will likely serve as suspects of future investigations, such as Jacob Solutions,
3841440	3848480	who performs range testing and lab services at WDTC. This contractor operates a premium facility at
3848480	3854480	Dugway Ditto and sees strong ties to its board of directors and the Carlisle Group. However,
3854480	3860320	due to the intense focus of Dugway on biochem weapons programs, Battelle will remain our primary
3860320	3867040	suspect in UAP legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground. Hey guys, it's Gerb and I'd like to
3867040	3872240	thank you all so much for joining me today as we took this extended look into Dugway Proving Ground.
3872960	3878960	Now, why did we partake in this investigation? Well, for one, something I've noticed and I'm
3878960	3886880	sure many other have is discussion of Dugway around UFOs and legacy programs are quite intertwined.
3886880	3894160	However, there is barely any other discussion or research or claims or testimony involving Dugway.
3894160	3899760	I think the perfect example of this is the beginning quest TV video featuring Nick Pope
3899760	3905040	talking about Area 51 to Area 52. This entire 10-15 minute video on YouTube,
3905040	3910960	of course, the link will be in the description, discusses Area 51 and Dugway and talks about
3910960	3917520	it being the new Area 51. This video even features words from Richard Dolan. However,
3917520	3924560	zero evidence or testimony or anything is presented here. So after having the testimony of MS,
3924560	3930240	after having some of the words of Stephen Greer, A.H., A.J. Kratok and others, I thought it very
3930240	3936320	pertinent to actually dive into Dugway. Now, I have reason to believe that Dugway is indeed a
3936320	3942400	premier legacy reverse engineering material exploitation program. So I wanted to sift through
3942400	3946880	all of this information and present an argument, especially as we started to look
3947440	3954320	into Dugway structure and how Dugway is comprised of two major range test facility bases, a huge
3954320	3961120	piece of this investigation. As we know with the testimony of Ed, his claims of a reverse
3961120	3967840	engineering program covered two Air Force MRTFBs, the Edwards 412 test wing and the Nevada test and
3967840	3974160	training range. Dugway gives us an interesting look because due to the testimony of MS, we can
3974160	3980800	conclude of a joint reverse engineering program versus two branches of the military MRTFBs,
3980800	3986960	the Army's West Desert Test Center and the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range. This,
3986960	3991760	of course, then involves Army ATEC and their Joint Chemical Biological Defense Program
3991760	3999680	and the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby Hill Air Force Base. I tried to do many connections
3999680	4006400	between the 388th RANS, Range Squadron as it's listed, and the Edwards 412 test wing. Unfortunately,
4006400	4011280	there is very little to chew on there. However, I do think the argument presented here is strong
4011280	4018400	enough and there's enough valuable data and listed data here for any policymaker or any individual
4018400	4026960	with influence to conduct a comprehensive analysis of MS and others' claims. Now, of course, twice
4026960	4032800	in this video around the stiff sub-training facility location, I listed a disclaimer that
4032800	4039920	I was using only publicly available information. Now, I do this because when all the way back
4039920	4045920	when discussing NSWC Crane and the testimony of RA, or we now know Randy Anderson, I caught a little
4045920	4052640	bit of flak and a little bit of fright for mentioning Crane and the possibility that this could be a
4052640	4058160	catastrophic disclosure and could be a breach of national security due to this being an underground
4058240	4063040	location. Therefore, when discussing the dumb locations, I needed to preface by saying this
4063040	4068480	information was all public domain. And I thank you, Stephen Greer, for leaking that on the DPI
4068480	4074480	archive because that finally gave me a chance to talk about these locations. Seen as the last time
4074480	4080240	I covered MS, I was privy to these locations but did not think it appropriate to list them. But
4080240	4084320	Greer took it upon himself to list Granite Peak and the alleged dumb location by German Village
4084320	4091120	himself. So thank you for that. And I must state once again, as I did in the last project,
4091760	4098800	do not under any circumstances go looking for that location. Dugway Proving Ground is protected
4098800	4104800	land and protected airspace. These are military assets, do not go to the location. Okay, if that
4104800	4110720	is a location to a deep underground military base, which I highly wager it is, do not go there.
4110800	4114640	Okay, let's make that very clear. Just do not for your own safety, please.
4115680	4125600	Don't. So there's other data to discuss surrounding Dugway. As we saw with the Dugway
4125600	4133120	history, there's not much linking Dugway to UAP legacy programs, unlike something like Edwards,
4133120	4139280	or Norton, or even China Lake or White Sands Missile Range. One of the biggest features of
4139280	4144240	this project was of course the garrison crash, and then some of the claims of Area 51 being
4144240	4149200	moved to Area 52. Conversely, for a place like Edwards, we have the story of Kent Selen and the
4149200	4155200	ARV and, you know, numerous craft and operations being incited at Dugway. There is more in this
4155200	4160080	video. I wasn't able to include one such story is the testimony of current Air Force Colonel
4160080	4166240	Weinbrenner. Now Weinbrenner has a very interesting story as if anybody can remember back to the
4166240	4173440	Jesse Michaels interview with James Fox filmmaker James Fox. Fox discusses a film of the
4173440	4180320	Holloman Air Force base landing and how his friend Alan or yes, Alan Sandler viewed this film and
4180320	4187680	told Fox about it. Well, back in the 70s, Alan Sandler and his co video producer Robert Emanager
4187680	4194240	were attempting to make a documentary on UAP. This is when they were sequestered by two
4194240	4200560	enlisted Air Force personnel and shown the Holloman film and were licensed to utilize
4200560	4205760	the film. But that licensing was pulled soon thereafter. One of these individuals was Colonel
4205760	4212080	Weinbrenner. Now on Colonel Weinbrenner's deathbed to close friends and families, he allegedly
4212720	4219520	said that Utah is where the alien bodies are stored. Now that's a very interesting disclosure
4219520	4224080	where the alien bodies are stored. This would be a very interesting place for this to be
4224080	4228640	Dugway. You know, of course, quite often Fort Detrick is talked about. I do believe Lou mentioned
4228640	4234960	this in imminent as well, but as a place for biologics to be stored. And this is where
4234960	4242560	much chemical and biological defense systems are ran. And there's extreme ties to Dugway
4242640	4250160	with Fort Detrick. So there's also interesting data to explore of Dugway being not just a craft
4250160	4258480	exploitation program on the UTTR, but also a biologic study area. Could this be where biologics
4258480	4263360	autopsies take place where biological tissue is studied quite possibly. But this would be kept
4263360	4269040	under wraps as any chemical and biological data and information and study is incredibly
4269040	4273920	secretive and incredibly classified. As we've seen with Dugway, you know, Dugway's projects are
4274720	4282160	not spoken of often and 77% of Dugway's programs according to the GAO are conducted for the chemical
4282160	4288880	and biological defense program. I would like to know what everybody else here thought. And while
4288880	4294320	you're leaving your comments, let's also tuck into the testimony of MS. Of course, I had talked to
4294320	4299440	MS all the way back in June of 2024. And those are the clips I have used for the conversation
4299440	4305440	in this video exploration. I do plan to interview MS again, hopefully in person,
4306160	4313920	if that can be arranged. Hopefully, that can also be done with GP and the individual who claimed he
4313920	4319680	helped build the railroad system under Dugway. Such an investigation and interview with these
4319760	4325760	three individuals would truly be consequential. You know, I find a lot of value in MS's testimony
4325760	4330880	not because of him being reached out to by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which he
4330880	4337280	indeed was. I said in the project that he had received, I have seen the outreach from these
4337280	4345120	individuals wishing for him to go to the Hill to testify, but also because his testimony at Ditto
4345120	4351760	and Avery leads to such fruitful research. As we've seen with Avery, it has numerous,
4352400	4358240	numerous fascinating buildings that could be used for such operations, classified storage,
4358240	4363760	test operations, photo O&M, internal rail system to the Dugway deep underground facility,
4364560	4370160	just a very fascinating testimony to cover. And I must add, with the Dugway Dumb being just some
4370240	4376400	small type of concrete facility out in the desert, just serving as an elevator to a Dumb,
4376400	4384720	where it's this entrance point doesn't serve to transport vehicles or armor or logistics or weaponry
4384720	4392240	or food or anything but personnel traveling down. I must be quite plain here. In my videos,
4392240	4396400	I don't generally like to say, well, a source told me this, a source told me this, a source told me
4396400	4404080	this, but I do have a friend that has formerly served in the United States Army. This was in the
4404080	4412960	early 2010s that has talked to me about traveling in stiffs, subterranean facilities. I cannot reveal
4412960	4420080	these locations, but he said he traveled across state lines between stiffs in an underground
4420160	4427840	rail system that went so fast, it reminded him of flying in a plane of which he has great fear.
4428400	4434400	So the fear of a plane's acceleration is what he felt in the train. What was interesting to me
4435040	4441200	is the location to which he traveled. The entrance way to that location was a small,
4441200	4448640	what you could call janitorial building or kind of potable water treatment building in the middle
4448640	4455360	of nowhere. Just a small building nestled in a location that accessing these buildings took
4455360	4460560	you to an elevator to a deep underground facility. This is not the only individual I've talked to
4460560	4465440	who has accessed a stiff or a dumb, maybe we'll call them stiffs because it carries a little
4465440	4469840	more weight. I've talked to numerous people who have this is why this topic carries such great
4469840	4476320	interest to me, especially because dumps or stiffs are indeed real. As I said, oftentimes for corporate
4476320	4483040	facilities such as AT&T, who at least in the 90s and 2000s housed many underground server banks and
4484000	4490080	ICBM storage locations underground and possibly underwater under ocean surface as well,
4490080	4495760	as well as continuity of government COG installation COG continuity of government
4495760	4500320	reminds me a lot of when Colonel John B. Alexander, who isn't the most trustworthy in my opinion,
4501040	4506080	talked about Majestic 12 being real and serving as a continuity of government type institution.
4506080	4510400	This also reminds me of what also reminds me of continuity of government
4511520	4516560	is the description of the dugway done by GP, which can talk about transporting the president's plane
4516560	4522480	to anywhere in the country. So I hope everybody enjoyed this dive into dugway. I'd like to know
4522480	4527920	what everybody thinks. This was a very important project to me because, you know, just as in every
4527920	4536480	single video I discuss SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, FFRDCs or UARCs, I can now incorporate
4536480	4542320	such testimony of major range test facility bases and TNE, Test and Evaluation, Research and
4542320	4548240	Development Test and Evaluation, RD, TNE into my projects. Remember, guys, when he left service,
4548240	4556400	Witness Ed served on the Pentagon for Air Force RD, TNE. And this is where he claims that $34
4556480	4561760	and $40 billion went missing to non-authorized transfer of authority funds in fiscal year,
4562320	4568480	I think 2013 and 2014. So doge, if you're watching, go look at Air Force and possibly Army RD, TNE.
4569600	4573680	Anyways, what else can we discuss, guys? More interesting projects coming down the way.
4574880	4579680	As I say in every project, I do in fact have a Patreon if you want to support the channel.
4579680	4583520	I don't gatekeep any content, only support what you think the channel is worth. And please
4583520	4588080	remember to like and subscribe, guys. These investigations are my heart and soul. They do
4588080	4593360	take a long time. So any comments about your thoughts on the investigation is much appreciated.
4594000	4599360	If you've noticed some oddness with the old I here, I'm dealing with some problems because that is
4599360	4603760	what happens when you grapple with individuals who do not wash their training equipment enough,
4603760	4610240	do not wash their rash guards. So thank you to that person who decided to wrestle with a very
4610240	4616560	disgusting rash guard. I really appreciate that. But I'm also quite elated, guys, because
4616560	4621440	anybody who watches the channel and has interacted with me knows I am an Alexander Volkanovsky
4621440	4627440	superfan. And our glorious king has just been booked to fight Diego Lopez, blockhead Diego Lopez
4627440	4634400	at UFC 314 in Miami come April. So I am elated about that, that the dangerous power puncher
4634400	4641680	Toporio is moving up to lightweight and vacating the belt. This is sweet Christmas to me. So let
4641680	4645120	me know what you guys think about the investigation, guys. Please remember to like and subscribe,
4645120	4647520	and I will see everybody on the next show. Thank you.
