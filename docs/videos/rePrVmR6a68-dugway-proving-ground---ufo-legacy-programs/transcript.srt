1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
Officially designated as the Dugway Proving Ground, this military facility covers an astounding

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,200
1,250 square miles of the Great Salt Lake Desert.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,360
Dugway's official mission is to test top-secret weapons and aerospace systems, but UFO researchers

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,360
believe the true purpose of Area 52 is even more sinister.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,840
When you imagine UFO legacy program operations focused on the retrieval and exploitation

6
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,040
of technologies of unknown origin, what kind of facilities come to mind?

7
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
Is it Area 51, and it's alleged legendary auxiliary site S-4?

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,360
Maybe you think of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, and it's possible off-world

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,080
technologies division?

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,420
Or perhaps you reference China Lake Weapon Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Wright Patterson

11
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,500
Air Force Base, or any number of U.S. Department of Defense installations that are steeped in

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,300
UFO lore?

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Maybe, just maybe, when imagining UFO legacy program locations, you picture Dugway Proving

14
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,980
Ground, an enormous 1,300 square mile U.S. Army installation nestled between three mountain

15
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,780
ranges in remote Utah that specializes in the testing of biological and chemical weapons.

16
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,900
Even referred to as Area 52, Dugway Proving Ground rose to prominence in the late 90s as

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,900
the successor to Area 51's UFO programs due to heavy public exposure on the once-denied

18
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,380
Nevada site.

19
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,180
Ever since, the Utah site and accompanying two premier MRTFBs have been the focus for

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,580
deep-six clandestine UAP operations.

21
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,460
But this spotlight doesn't solely focus on the enormous facilities sprawling across the

22
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,660
Utah desert.

23
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,380
Dugway has additionally been accused as the location of a dumb, a deep underground military

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
base.

25
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,620
Today we shed light on Dugway and discussion of its technologies of unknown origin, exploitation

26
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,460
programs, and subterranean presence.

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:36,780
Through analysis of the facility's intriguing Army and Air Force MRTFBs, study of defense

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,060
contractors present on site, and careful evaluation of the witness testimony of one MS, who I

29
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,980
have covered on this channel before, who stumbled upon a craft of likely non-human origin at

30
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,340
the infamous Dugway range.

31
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,820
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we venture into the

32
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,860
world of legacy UFO programs to analyze Dugway Proving Ground.

33
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,660
How deep does the rabbit hole go between the United States' premier biological and chemical

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,460
weapons testing facility and non-human technology?

35
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:15,580
But individuals, military units, and corporations possibly engage with Dugway and UFO reverse

36
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,180
engineering and material exploitation programs.

37
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,100
And does Dugway operate such UFO programs above and below the Earth's surface?

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Join me today as we find out.

39
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,060
Dugway Proving Ground is located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Tawilla County, Utah.

40
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,580
The site encompasses over 1,250 square miles and it is larger than the U.S. state of Rhode

41
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,740
Island.

42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,540
The site itself is ideal for seclusion and privacy free from urban encroachment, light

43
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,820
pollution, and excess acoustic and electronic noise.

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,020
Dugway is surrounded by mountains, salt flats, and desert terrain.

45
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,940
These geological features combined with a defense retainer that will apprehend approaching

46
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,140
civilians with armed personnel and black-op helicopters.

47
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,900
Make the Utah Proving Ground perfect for clandestine and classified military test and evaluation.

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,100
Dugway was founded in 1942 with the mission to test U.S. and allied chemical and biological

49
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,960
defense systems and perform nuclear, biological, and chemical survivability testing and training

50
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,460
of defense material using chemical and biological agents and stimulants.

51
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,860
The Utah Proving Ground uses its state-of-the-art laboratories and chambers to conduct testing

52
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,300
and training under environmentally controlled conditions.

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,580
Dugway's inception arose from the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks which quickly saw the United

54
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,020
States military increase military capabilities in numerous areas including chemical and biological

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,180
warfare.

56
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,540
The infamous site has participated in the never-ending global war on terrorism, employing

57
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,100
Special Forces mission rehearsals, classified testing, and biochem urgent need equipment

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
testing.

59
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,460
Dugway has a laundry list of significant accomplishments including unmanned aerial systems test support,

60
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,780
but we will skip over exploring this entire list of accomplishments.

61
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,740
According to a 2021 U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground Mission and Capabilities Overview public

62
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,540
report, Dugway is a massive contributor to Utah's economy.

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:39,900
Deploying a total of 2,120 employees in residence, 784 of which are primarily Army and Air Force

64
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:47,100
contractors, 622 of which consist of primary mission and installation contracting command,

65
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:54,540
think on-site security personnel, and 486 of these military or defense agency civilians.

66
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,740
Dugway or DPG, as we'll refer to it throughout this project, partners with myriad U.S. military,

67
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,260
government, and intelligence agencies including many that harbor our interest throughout this

68
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
investigation.

69
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:14,500
U.S. Army Airborne, Navy, SOCOM, a.k.a. Special Operations Command, the 388th Range Squadron

70
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,660
out of Hill Air Force Base, Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Interior, NASA,

71
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,700
and three universities.

72
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,180
Out of these three universities, I would like to draw specific mention to Utah State University.

73
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,300
U.S.U. employs a university affiliated research center, UARC, for the Missile Defense Agency

74
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,780
known as the Space Dynamics Laboratory.

75
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,820
In numerous projects, I have spoken on UARCs and their similar counterparts Federally Funded

76
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,540
Research and Development Center's FFRDCs.

77
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,700
FFRDCs and UARCs are semi-private, DOD-driven research and development institutions.

78
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:57,780
I have spoken ad nauseam, our key contributors to UAP legacy programs.

79
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:04,140
While not the topic of today, UARCs and FFRDCs likely exist as a sort of project manager,

80
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,700
serving as subject matter experts and research and development leaders for joint corporate

81
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,980
and U.S. government UAP programs.

82
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,180
In fact, I believe these two types of institutions to be exponentially more knowledgeable on and

83
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,300
crucial to UFO exploitation programs than most defense contractors through their sole source

84
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
contracts.

85
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,820
On this topic for another day, however, FFRDC will come up again throughout this presentation.

86
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,620
For this investigation, we will primarily be focusing on two locations on Dugway known

87
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,940
as MRTFBs, Major Range Test and Facility Bases.

88
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,880
MRTFBs are known as the, quote, core set of DOD test and evaluation infrastructure and

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,820
associated workforce that must be preserved as a national asset to provide T&E capabilities

90
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,500
to support the DOD acquisition system, end quote.

91
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,540
The quote unquote critical core of test bases comprise over 10 million acres of land in

92
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:10,900
the United States, employ over 25,000 people annually and receive over $4 billion in acknowledged

93
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,540
funding annually.

94
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,700
There exists a total of 23 acknowledged MRTFBs, eight Army including Yuma Test Center, Arizona

95
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
and White Sands missile range.

96
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,580
Six Navy installations including Naval Air Warfare Center Pax River and China Lake Naval

97
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,420
Warfare Center and seven Air Force Bases including Edwards 412 Test Wing, Nevada Test and Training

98
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:40,460
Range and the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg and two defense agency bases.

99
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,980
Many here will associate all listed locations with mentions of UFO legacy programs.

100
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,340
I myself have extensively published on witness Ed, who spoke of a joint UFO reverse engineering

101
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:58,260
operation between the Nevada Test and Training Range and Edwards 412 Test Wing in California.

102
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,380
I strongly recommend viewing this project if you have not already.

103
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:09,580
Dugway Proving Ground possesses one such MRTFB, the US Army's West Desert Test Center and

104
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,540
also shares the South Range of the Air Force's MRTFB, Utah Test and Training Range with

105
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,100
nearby Hill Air Force Base.

106
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,860
Pay close attention to these two major bases as when we analyze the testimony of MS we

107
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,020
will be exploring a thesis of a joint Army and Air Force legacy program comprised of

108
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:37,660
the WDTC West Desert Test Center and the UTTR Utah Test and Training Range that extend deep

109
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,100
below the Earth's surface.

110
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,460
And while on the subject of MRTFB's we will dive into much more detail later on including

111
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,540
discussing the Avery Technical Center and shared Michael Army Airfield which I believe

112
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,860
is the operational above ground testing location of this joint UFO project.

113
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,900
But before we venture into Dugway's history with UFO, let's touch on one more thing while

114
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,820
the West Desert Test Center is fresh in your mind.

115
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,260
Investors at WDTC are spearheaded by Army Test and Evaluation Command.

116
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:16,220
As we begin to implicate Dugway and thus ATEC as engaging in UFO legacy programs I find

117
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,700
the Army Test and Evaluation Organization structure well worth referencing.

118
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,260
Analyzing the reporting structure of ATEC, far up the food chain we can observe the Secretary

119
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,980
of the Army as well as the Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army answering

120
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,620
directly to the US Secretary of Defense.

121
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,260
Those subsets pertain to these four positions including Director of Operational Test and

122
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,740
Evaluation.

123
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,860
But what is interesting here is oversight and TNE policy as well as USA Tech Command

124
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:53,060
is independent from Conventional Army Research and Development Test and Evaluation structure.

125
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,060
This independence is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Office

126
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,300
of the Secretary of Defense.

127
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,820
This separation exists apparently to ensure warfighter safety through unbiased evaluation

128
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,020
as well as credibility with decision makers, but I can't help but to think here such a

129
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,420
structure could quickly lead to a lack of oversight on ATEC programs and thus a lack of oversight

130
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:26,540
on West Desert Test Center programs at Dugway Proving Ground.

131
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,580
Let us pause and reflect on historical mentions of Dugway and analyze how and why this site

132
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,140
has often been referred to as Area 52.

133
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,700
Serving as the United States premiered biological and chemical weapons facility, it is no surprise

134
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,940
the secrets of Dugway and its decades of classified operations are held close to the chest of

135
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,380
US military and intelligence.

136
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:54,940
I would like to briefly discuss a fascinating alleged 1953 UFO crash retrieval case that

137
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:02,020
occurred less than one month after and solely 200 miles north of the infamous 1953 Kingman,

138
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,460
Arizona crash.

139
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,420
The Garrison, Utah UFO crash retrieval was investigated at length by UFO researcher Steve

140
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,500
Jones and relayed as a moderate confidence case in Ryan S. Woods masterpiece Magic Eyes

141
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Only.

142
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,380
Steve Jones was first introduced to the case by a group called the Phoenix Project in 1993.

143
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:30,140
A group member Al discussed the case with 10-15 large aerial photos dated June of 1953.

144
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,980
These images apparently depicted a large valley with a triangular shaped area on the ground.

145
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,580
A remote station resides alongside the feature called the Desert Range Experimental Station,

146
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,260
or DRES, which is located on the southwest of Dugway's West Desert Test Center extending

147
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,300
from Tuila to Millard County.

148
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,900
DRES is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an arm of the Department of Agriculture.

149
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:01,700
The Phoenix Project group presented to Jones a DRES logbook dated 1979-1980 that featured

150
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,100
peculiar entries such as USAF and Army personnel from Fort Carson, Colorado, USAF command center

151
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,540
personnel and representatives from a defense contractor.

152
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,140
Phoenix Project believed the DRES to be a front for a secret research facility that

153
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,220
studied a crashed UFO that was buried resulting in the surrounding geology.

154
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,100
During his many visits to the site, Steve Jones was indeed able to track down witnesses

155
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,220
who claimed to see such a crashed object.

156
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,860
Local resident Bart Wright claimed as a child living 8 miles outside of Garrison, he saw

157
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,060
a strange blue light streak across the sky and crash near the side of the valley containing

158
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
DRES.

159
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,820
According to Wright, the impact caused the ground to shake and sky to light up.

160
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,620
Steve Jones hired a geologist in 1999 named Lamont Sorensen to conduct magnimeter and

161
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,500
seismic tests on the triangular formation where the craft allegedly crashed.

162
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,780
The geologist found no evidence of underground anomalies but did claim he did not think the

163
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,900
formation was made by nature.

164
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,220
He thought that some kind of artificial digging process did in fact take place.

165
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,780
Whenever a buried UFO is mentioned, this leads to an interesting case but ultimately the

166
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,580
Garrison Utah crash is a dead end.

167
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,140
I would also like to reference the story of the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle

168
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,020
many viewers of this channel will be quite familiar with.

169
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,780
During his decades of investigating into the copy vehicles observed by primary witness

170
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:34,820
Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, the late Mark McCandlish would

171
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,580
encounter multiple witnesses who had encountered and seen craft similar to the instantly identifiable

172
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,220
Fluxliner.

173
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,900
Of note were two photographs McCandlish obtained possession of from USAF Captain Harvey Williams.

174
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:56,980
Williams photographed this disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah.

175
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,300
The object bears striking resemblance to the Fluxliner and possibly details an intriguing

176
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,900
evolution in imaging technology from 1967 to Brad's observation in 1988.

177
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,020
Let me explain.

178
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:16,060
Brad and McCandlish claim the ARV flew via a synthetic vision system overlapping cameras

179
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,860
that allowed for a pilot inside the craft to access full 3D view when operating the craft.

180
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,940
The cameras were housed in protective acrylic bubbles almost appearing as off-the-shelf components.

181
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,200
Due to cameras being much larger in 1967, if the USAF Captain did indeed photograph an

182
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,760
early model of the Fluxliner, this would feature a larger synthetic vision system to accommodate

183
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,880
larger camera technology.

184
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,280
But I am equally, if not more, interested in the location of this sighting at a low altitude

185
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
of 12,000 feet.

186
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:56,480
Provo, Utah is only 100 miles from Dugway and less than 75 miles from Hill Air Force Base.

187
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,260
Remember what we discussed earlier, Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share runways such

188
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,780
as the Dugway-Michael Army Airfield and operate together in the Utah Test and Training Range

189
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,520
Southern Area.

190
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,300
Also recall the numerous mentions of MRTFBs and how two such critical cores reside on

191
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Dugway.

192
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,140
I would once again like to reference witness Ed and the Joint Reverse Engineering Program

193
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,100
between the Edwards 412th Test Wing and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

194
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,620
Both the 412th and NTTR are Air Force MRTFBs just as the UTTR is.

195
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:39,180
The testimony of Ed explores two MRTFBs working in conjunction to test reverse engineered vehicles.

196
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,780
USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet stated the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle saw operations

197
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,340
at Area 51 which is part of the NTTR and pilots inside the triangle were pulled from

198
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,440
Edwards Air Force Test Pilot School, part of the 412th.

199
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,300
The Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicles were allegedly shown at Norton Air Force Base

200
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,740
in 1988, which is with an extreme proximity to the fabled USAF Plant 42 and Edwards Air

201
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,980
Force Base.

202
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,900
If Harvey Williams did indeed image early iterations of the Fluxliner, this would imply

203
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,980
a UFO reverse engineering and ARV testing program between two MRTFBs.

204
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,600
Utah Test and Training Range and Edwards 412th Test Wing.

205
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,380
This is incredibly similar to the claims of Ed and Fouchet.

206
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,420
Further in this exploration, we will investigate a possible UFO legacy program operating across

207
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,940
both Army and Air Force MRTFBs at Dugway, but we will save this for later.

208
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,060
In June of 1997, Popular Mechanics Magazine published a stunning monthly issue.

209
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,260
The titular article titled The New Area 51 discussed the Air Force abandoning its once

210
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,020
most secretive site for top secret testing and moved to a new, more private location.

211
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,260
Let's, of course, dive into this intriguing article to discover the quote-unquote New

212
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,180
Area 51 and its secret airbase operations.

213
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,480
Right off the jump, the images in this piece are fascinating.

214
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,720
We see a sticky note that says, Call Admiral Inman at Science Applications International.

215
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,900
Now I know this isn't the subject of the video, but for an article that mocks the idea

216
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,840
of UFO reverse engineering programs by claiming those who believe the X-Files and existence

217
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,920
of a Dress Collection by former FBI Director Edgar Hoover are the type of people to believe

218
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,880
in UFO crash retrievals, why is Bobby Ray Inman mentioned?

219
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,520
Members of this channel may recall recent mention of Inman in the Northrop Grumman Project.

220
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,240
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former NSA Director, CIA Deputy Director, and Science Applications

221
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:52,280
International Corporation SAIC Board Member, once discussed UFO recovered vehicles to NASA

222
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,800
mission specialist Bob Eschler.

223
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,320
Inman also referred Eschler to retired Rear Admiral and BDM Board Member Sumner Shapiro,

224
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,840
who informed Eschler, UAP retrievals would see teams take apart craft, pack them up,

225
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,920
and ship them around the country to different laboratories.

226
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,840
Inman is an integral figure in the discussion of UFO crash retrievals in the 1980s.

227
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,040
And I do not need to go into SAIC and their likely involvement in an off-world technologies

228
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,580
division at NSWC Crane.

229
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,880
This tiny sticky note in a rather deprecating article is incredibly interesting.

230
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,080
The popular mechanics piece states due to overexposure as America's worst kept secret

231
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,440
Area 51 shut down.

232
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,440
This is of course objectively false, however.

233
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,200
Later individuals we will discuss in this project reference a percentage of up to 40%

234
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,440
of Area 51's clandestine operations moving to Dugway.

235
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,320
One primary reason for the move out of Area 51 according to the popular mechanics author

236
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Jim Wilson was the need for a different type of proving ground for ultra high performance

237
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
military aircraft.

238
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
After some impressive sleuthing including referencing Air Force Base Command General

239
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,320
Howell Estes and NASA Administrator Daniel Golden's 1997 agreement to share quote unquote

240
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,480
redundant assets, as well as a 1996 NASA announcement stating Michael Army Airfield would share

241
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,480
as a runway for several X-33 missions popular mechanics narrowed in on Utah.

242
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,400
In a quick side note, the X-33 aircraft capable of Mach 15 was a Lockheed Martin Skunkworks

243
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,200
production formed out of the Palmdale facility.

244
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,360
Both Michael Army Airfield which shits nestled on Dugway's West Desert Test Center within

245
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,360
the Avery Technical Center and don't worry much more on this later.

246
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,680
As well as Green River Utah Launch Complex part of White Sands missile range were ideal

247
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,160
installations for the new Area 51.

248
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,920
Michael Army Airfield possessed an equally if not more deterring surrounding area than

249
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,480
Area 51.

250
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,960
Not only is the airfield situated on 1300 square miles of Dugway ranges but it is also

251
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,600
bordered by numerous mountain ranges and salt flats.

252
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,440
The airfield did however lack adequate landing runways according to popular mechanics which

253
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,400
is why Utah Launch Complex situated only 200 miles away served as the ideal dance partner

254
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,560
for the Michael Army Airfield.

255
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,760
The magazine attempted flyovers of the airfield to snap images of the surrounding area but

256
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
were warned of being shot down.

257
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,760
Additionally, the magazine attempted to purchase satellite imagery of the Utah Launch Complex

258
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,520
but was denied due to security reasons.

259
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,400
The claims of a new Area 51 are not isolated to mainstream publishers like popular mechanics.

260
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,200
Let's revisit the testimony of Edgar Fouchet in the TR-3B.

261
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Like I said in the Northrop Project, many are critical of Fouchet due to his claims of

262
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,120
a reverse-engineered triangular alien reproduction vehicle with little in the way of physical

263
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
proof.

264
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,960
However, his disclosures have led to incredibly actionable intelligence and worthwhile investigation.

265
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:12,240
In his 1998 IUFOC, International UFO Congress Presentation, Fouchet presented comprehensive

266
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,960
disclosures of TR-3B, Area 51, NSA's Men in Black Treat, EG&G, and Project Red Light,

267
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,960
as well as the DARCE Defense Advanced Research Center which I have talked about numerous

268
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,520
times on this channel.

269
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,680
In the presentation, Fouchet made mention to a source informing him beginning in 1992

270
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,480
the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to massive public attention on Area 51.

271
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,120
This would see the majority of exotic Air Force platforms relocated to Utah, Colorado,

272
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,240
Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia, and south of Area 51 to S-4.

273
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,360
And there is evidence to show a heavy focus on Area 51 and UFO programs in the early 1990s

274
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,040
which may in fact have seen projects moved out of Area 51 Groom Lake.

275
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,780
In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least 8 black programs

276
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,420
flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional

277
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,820
technologies.

278
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,340
An unnamed source Goodall knew for 12 years stationed at Groom Lake later explained that

279
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,540
UAP positively existed at the base while another source stated, quote, we have things out there

280
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,260
that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in

281
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,060
the movies, end quote.

282
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:34,220
Programs of Area 51 moving clandestine operations to Dugway were additionally made by one A.H.

283
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,740
A.H claimed to be a former Boeing employee who leveraged significant knowledge on UFO

284
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:47,020
legacy programs from friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, ONI, NRO, Area 51, the Air Force

285
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,500
Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and others.

286
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,100
A.H appeared as a primary witness on Stephen Greer's 2001 excellent disclosure briefing

287
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,120
document and had his testimony taped in the year 2000.

288
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,260
Now it's worth noting as I discussed in the Northrop project, A.H is likely a primary

289
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,380
source of information for Dr. Stephen Greer, similar to UFO researcher William Hamilton.

290
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,940
As A.H has been in contact with Greer for decades, and Greer repeats much of what A.H has stated

291
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,440
in the past.

292
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,540
Greer talks often of Dugway as a primary UFO legacy program site, discussing a Utah underground

293
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,780
complex south of Salt Lake City accessible only by air in the 2001 disclosure briefing

294
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,220
document and again in a 2016 presentation.

295
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,900
In this 26 presentation, Greer discussed Black program locations and codenames which

296
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,260
relate to the testimony of Ed.

297
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,260
In this discussion, Greer tags Dugway as quote, the most critical one, end quote, when discussing

298
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,100
Black program facilities.

299
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,500
And in Utah, one of the most critical, and this is the most critical one that's new,

300
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,900
is the Dugway proving grounds outside of Provo, and this is classified air space above and

301
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,220
no access by ground.

302
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,500
Above ground, you don't see much and everything is underground.

303
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,300
Richard Foch, this Naval Research Labs official, was out there with some generation five or

304
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,940
six or whatever night scopes doing an operation.

305
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,780
When he looked out and he saw these objects coming out from underground that then zipped

306
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,380
over and that were these massive disk and triangular shape anti-gravity objects that

307
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,380
were ours.

308
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,140
And some were just sitting out there watching him.

309
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,380
And that's outside of Provo out in the desert.

310
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,780
It is not inconceivable many of Greer's early ideas on Dugway were disclosed to him by witness

311
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,980
A.H.

312
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,180
After all, in 2000, A.H. did in fact reference an underground Utah installation southwest

313
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:52,180
of Salt Lake City accessible only by air that tests and maintains extraterrestrial technology.

314
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,540
We're incorporating this technology from this craft that the Area 51 and I also found out

315
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:05,500
that they are moving a lot of the personnel and some of the equipment and some of the

316
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:14,020
extraterrestrial technology equipment and the craft to base up in Utah.

317
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
Is it right?

318
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:23,020
And they move very 50 most stuff from Area 51 at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.

319
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:29,260
However, we can find some extremely interesting pre 2000s discussion of Dugway by Greer.

320
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:35,620
See on screen now a March 1998 email exchange with Greer and UFO investigator Steve Jones.

321
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:42,820
Yes, the same investigator we discussed above with the alleged 1953 Garrison Utah UFO crash.

322
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,460
In these initial exchanges, Jones details his field notes while near the Desert Range

323
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,020
experimental station studying the retrieval case.

324
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,420
Jones mentioned he had learned that work from Area 51 Groom Lake had indeed been moved to

325
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,900
Dugway in an area called Dog west of the main gate.

326
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,820
Jones himself had collected data since the 1980s on tarped trucks left in the middle

327
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,660
of nowhere in Utah.

328
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,540
These truckloads were left between Hill Air Force Base north of Salt Lake and Wendover

329
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,820
Utah bordering Nevada.

330
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,540
This between area is of course Dugway and the Utah test and training range.

331
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,780
Recall also that Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share air strips in the UTTR.

332
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,980
Hill itself and its 388th range squadron operate on the Dugway-Michael Army airfield.

333
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,660
What is more intriguing to me is an even earlier 1996 exchange of emails between Greer and

334
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:45,740
one AJ Kradock with the subject line quote, Area 51, insiders say area southwest of Tawilla,

335
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,780
Utah deserve a look and quote, AJ aka Tony Kradock once did work with Greer serving as

336
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,860
webmaster for csetty.org.

337
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,700
Kradock is also the founder and CEO of Kradock, an oil and gas service provider in Libya.

338
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,540
Why did a CEO with 40 years experience in the international petroleum industry engage

339
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,740
in UFO research with Greer in the 90s?

340
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,540
Anyways, in this email address to Greer, Kradock links a discussion with an insider

341
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,740
source.

342
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,940
The sender or insider had their credentials withheld but claimed to work on several sites,

343
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,460
checking badges and running ground surveillance equipment, tremor sensors, ground surveillance

344
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,100
radar, etc.

345
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,540
The source additionally discussed EMP weaponry that could fry vehicle computers or electronics.

346
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,380
We live in a world where EMP devices are often discussed as legacy program weapons to shoot

347
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,200
down non-human craft, so this inclusion is interesting.

348
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,480
The source claims Kradock and others, implying Greer, were looking in two obvious directions

349
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,560
for UAP programs.

350
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,800
Although Area 51 did indeed have legacy programs, the source advised Kradock to look in the

351
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,200
state of Utah to the southwest of Tawilla County and west of Salt Lake City.

352
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,440
In this described area existed nine exclusion zones, four of which featured underground

353
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,080
locations and this area, of course, is dugway-proving ground.

354
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,640
The Kradock-Greer connection here is fascinating and well worth exploring more.

355
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,320
However, remember this discussion of dugway, Area 51, and mysterious programs took place

356
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,600
before the 1997 Popular Mechanics article on the new Area 51, Fuchet's Disclosures,

357
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,160
and A.H.'s film testimony.

358
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,760
Very pertinent, this insider source claimed to have knowledge of dugway-proving ground

359
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:45,840
and UFO legacy programs before any public exposure.

360
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,280
In June of 2023, the contentious Stephen Greer held his first whistleblower symposium at

361
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,580
the National Press Club since his 2001 panel.

362
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,600
That featured the legendary Mark McCandillish amongst other first-hand witnesses.

363
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,280
Viewers may remember this panel as featuring the first public disclosures of Michael Herrera,

364
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,520
and we now know UFO whistleblower Jake Barber was in attendance.

365
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,940
One witness featured was not present at the event and had his story told by Greer.

366
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,160
This was a witness known by the pseudonym MS.

367
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,680
So there's another gentleman.

368
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm going to run through these very quickly.

369
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
We'd be here for 30 hours if I didn't.

370
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,520
I'm just giving you a tip of the iceberg, right?

371
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,600
This is a guy who is at the dugway-proving grounds for a key facility, MS, we call him.

372
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,960
He was a work for C. Martin Corporation contractor, and he was in a facility that had an extraterrestrial

373
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,040
vehicle that was being studied by scientists.

374
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,240
He knows the chief scientist involved.

375
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,040
He has named that individual to us, and they can all be subpoenaed now.

376
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,520
So this object was there in 2009.

377
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,280
He didn't know the date of acquisition, but he thought it was fairly recent.

378
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Next.

379
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,000
He also was read into and had the chief scientist show him the location which we now have of

380
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,720
a dumb, deep underground military base that is in the dugway sector, so-called Avery Sector

381
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,400
A-V-E-R-Y, and it has huge capacity for parking.

382
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,440
You go in and there's a vast underground complex in that location.

383
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,560
That location has been handed off to investigators with the U.S. government.

384
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,720
Next.

385
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,920
This gives an illustration of the size of this.

386
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,040
You could put easily on the platform that goes down the Air Force One.

387
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,800
It's a very large elevator goes down underground.

388
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,320
Upon release of the DPI archive, I investigated all files relating to this fascinating case.

389
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,120
Files on MS can be found under witness ID 10655.

390
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,320
Due to lapses in site security and data presented in the documents, I was able to track down

391
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,280
witness MS and hear his incredible encounter at Dugway firsthand.

392
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,920
Investors of my channel may recall an interview with MS in UFO Witness' redacted list.

393
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,800
This project was deleted to respect the privacy of other witnesses covered in the project,

394
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
however.

395
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,320
I would now like to revisit the testimony of MS with exponentially greater focus on his

396
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
claims.

397
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,040
The purpose of this investigation will be to identify specific buildings and military

398
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,560
units operating UFO legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground as well as explore any and

399
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,760
all evidence to the enormous facility likely beneath the ground of the Utah site.

400
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,120
And before we get started, I would like to add MS was approached by elements of the Senate

401
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,040
Select Committee on Intelligence to testify regarding his claims and I can confirm this

402
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,080
as he shared with me the screenshots of their outreach.

403
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,200
MS turned down the requests as he is a current railroad employee and was unable to break

404
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,280
away from work for a week plus even when SSCI offered to pay for his travel.

405
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,880
I have a tremendous amount of respect for MS and find great value in researching his

406
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,280
testimony.

407
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,600
Witness MS served in the U.S. Navy and was even stationed in the auxiliary division

408
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,120
of the USS Teddy Roosevelt from 1990 to 2000.

409
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,840
Following his service, MS entered into government contracting work.

410
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,800
From 2009 to 2013, he worked as a maintenance painter and sign technician for the C. Martin

411
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Company.

412
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,640
C. Martin is a DOD contractor whose mission is to, quote, provide a fine-tuned approach

413
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,720
to managing people, time and resources to provide quality services while creating value

414
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
for our customers, end quote.

415
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,160
C. Martin operates as a prime subcontractor with DOD in myriad capacities, specializing

416
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,560
in facility operations and maintenance, logistics, construction, range operation and maintenance,

417
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
etc.

418
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,280
And C. Martin does indeed have a location on Dugway located near the administration

419
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
center.

420
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,960
C. Martin's range and facility, operations and maintenance contracting pertains greatly

421
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,440
to areas of interest for this investigation, specifically for Avery Technical Center, which

422
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,800
resides on Michael Army Airfield shared with Hill Air Force Base in the 388th Range Squadron

423
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,360
as well as locations a stone throw away called Ditto Technical Center.

424
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,720
Ditto contains the heart of the West Desert Test Center, which alongside ATEC tests chemicals

425
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,360
and biological weapons across the Utah range.

426
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,680
In fact, the Army Test and Evaluation Command Major Range and Facility Base West Desert

427
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:28,160
Test Center is majorly funded by the Joint Services Chemical and Biological Defense Program

428
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:35,360
CBDP, a lot of acronyms I know, but remember the term CBDP as we will discuss it again

429
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,160
both in relation to a specific contractor of interest at Dugway and for MS's story.

430
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:47,040
Now MS's experience begins in 2009, four months into his work for C. Martin at Dugway.

431
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,840
MS held a level 5 proximity badge, which allowed him access to myriad facilities across Dugway

432
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,640
to perform DOD contractor work.

433
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,720
And crucial to note, MS did not have a security clearance even though he occasionally states

434
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,480
level 5 clearance instead of badge.

435
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,160
MS would often ride into Dugway Proving Ground from Caysville, Utah in a van where all other

436
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,200
travelers held top secret clearance.

437
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,080
On normal day on the job, MS was tasked with electrical meter reading to allow the U.S.

438
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,000
government to bill various contractors working on site.

439
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,920
In 2009 is when it happened, I was about four months into working there.

440
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,040
There was a kid that was underneath me as my apprentice because I was one of the maintenance

441
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
painters.

442
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,920
We took care of every facility out there and so he called in sick one day.

443
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,200
I had to go read beaders for him because that's what they do.

444
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:54,440
So the government is in control of about 48% of that and then 52% of it is private contractor

445
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,920
and that's why they don't have to disclose anything.

446
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,520
So I had to go out read his meter that day to get everything turned in to the government

447
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,560
and I can't remember how many facilities there were.

448
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:15,520
Probably a good 15 but those 15 took me to places where I've never really been out there

449
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,000
and opened my eyes up to a lot of different things.

450
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,840
This led MS to the Avery Technical Center where he entered into the quote unquote ghost building,

451
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,560
a building nicknamed for having no numbers and no insignia.

452
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,680
Initially, I believed these facilities may be the material test facility or defensive

453
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,800
test chamber just south of Avery across the road from Ditto Technical Center.

454
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,360
After all, MS will soon describe the incident location as a clean room of sorts and these

455
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,080
two facilities are high profile CBDP test areas on site at the West Desert Test Center.

456
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,920
However, these installations are well known and indeed named and numbered.

457
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,360
On the other hand, Avery Technical Center yields very few search results and quite often

458
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,720
does not appear in numerous U.S. Army and ATEC documents.

459
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,280
In fact, Avery is curiously missing from DPG visitor guides while other areas of interest

460
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,080
such as Ditto are clearly mentioned.

461
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,960
Last time I covered MS's testimony, I had very little to work off regarding Avery,

462
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,840
bar a September 2017 DTTF facility description document and image from Facebook.

463
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:35,400
Before we investigate Avery, I must clearly state I am not revealing any classified information.

464
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,120
All locations and installations to be discussed can be referenced in public domain materials.

465
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,760
Let's reference a July 2012 unclassified report titled Environmental Assessment of

466
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,000
the Continued Exclusive Use of Department of the Army Land Located at U.S. Army Dugway

467
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,120
Proving Ground by members of the U.S. Air Force that offers incredible insights and exploration

468
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,040
into Avery Technical Center.

469
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,120
As mentioned numerous times so far, Avery borders Michael Army airfield and both the

470
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,440
airfield and 40 acre Avery area are the focus of the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby

471
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
Hill Air Force Base.

472
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,120
Avery partly serves as air testing slash training for the 388th.

473
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Historically, Avery had conducted numerous radiological studies and investigations into

474
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,760
the handling of radioactive material, including utilizing the Radiobiological Warfare Laboratories

475
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,080
for the Atomic Energy Commission.

476
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Avery employs an internal rail system for the transportation of radioactive materials.

477
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,280
This mention of an internal rail system is truly massive as we further on investigate

478
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,000
Dugway's alleged deep underground military base.

479
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Aerial views of Avery yield no building descriptions unlike the nearby Ditto area where facilities

480
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,080
like the Diner, Contractor Jacobs, etc. are mentioned.

481
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,200
However, this Environmental Assessment document offers us a gorgeous detailed overview of

482
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,520
Avery locations see on screen now.

483
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Locations of interest include the 10-02 Avery Tunnel Entrance, 10-12 Photo Operations and

484
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,920
Maintenance, 10-38 General Storage, and 10-16 Classified Storage.

485
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,680
Now other buildings outside of this map not marked developed slash unclassified exist.

486
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,400
However, I am willing to bet this experience took place at Building 10-10 Test Operations.

487
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,360
But enough investigation, let's hear from MS as he entered this ghost building.

488
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,400
I walked into one that they called the ghost building because it just kind of came out

489
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
of nowhere.

490
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
No numbers on it, no nothing.

491
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,920
And opened up the door and basically had a M16 stuck in my chest and I had my level

492
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
5 badge on.

493
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,880
I think that was the only thing that saved my tail that day.

494
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,160
And there were what I call white coats, you know, they're kind of like doctors type set

495
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,960
up inside the building, kind of like a little clean room area.

496
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,560
And you know, I'm sure I don't know if you've ever been in a car accident or not, but when

497
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,320
you you have your life kind of flashed before your eyes, everything starts to slow down

498
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,560
and you start really taking in a lot of information very quickly.

499
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,040
And so that's that's what I, you know, what happened to me is with with the gun and everything

500
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:34,760
else that just kind of everything just started started to fall into place.

501
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,320
That thing was on its own power when I hovered, there was there's kind of a I don't know

502
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:49,600
if you've seen the rendering or not, yes, the door, there was no door just kind of open

503
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:56,480
on the bottom, but everything is just kind of just walking there on its own power.

504
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,520
I don't always know anything, but the white coats walk around and analyze and do all their

505
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
stuff.

506
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I don't know.

507
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,720
There's, you know, a few gift armed guards in there at the time and I like I said, I don't

508
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,840
know if they were getting ready to move or, you know, what have you quickly before we

509
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,360
discussed this incredible craft, who were these armed guards that held MS at gunpoint?

510
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,040
While numerous US facilities actually contract security personnel instead of enlisted men,

511
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,360
this is done through sole source contracts.

512
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,200
A contract method Dr. Eric Davis has stated is used for UAP legacy programs.

513
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,520
These contracts were given to private security companies post 9 11 to bolster US Army and

514
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,040
other military installation security.

515
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,480
I have found a 2006 General Accounting Office report titled, quote, Army's Guard program

516
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,360
requires greater oversight and reassessment of acquisition approach, end quote.

517
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,960
This document discusses all contracted security personnel issued by the Army.

518
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,040
Dugway Proving Ground utilize Chenega integrated systems.

519
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,280
In future projects, I will be interested in exploring both Chenega and their subcontractor,

520
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,960
Vance Federal Security Services.

521
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,680
Wackenhut Services, which Admiral Bobby Ray Inman was formerly a board member of, is a

522
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,960
private security corporation I highly suspect was involved in UAP legacy program security.

523
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,680
Wackenhut, like Vance Federal Security Systems, were used as subcontractors to Army installation,

524
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,800
not primary contractors.

525
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,360
Now, unless contractor security personnel were highly cleared security specialists,

526
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,040
I highly doubt these private security companies could do more than scan vehicles and check

527
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,200
badges for access to legacy program sites.

528
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,720
Therefore, while I do reckon security services like Wackenhut and possibly Chenega have historically

529
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,880
performed installation and access security for UAP legacy program locations, I must conclude

530
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,840
the armed guards within proximity to the saucer were known as industrial security, Indusec personnel.

531
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,240
Now, why that conclusion?

532
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,920
Industrial security, quote, conducts risk management activities with respect to the

533
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,160
US government's defense industrial base, including critical technologies and the defense

534
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,680
supply chain through oversight of the national industrial security program, issuance of facility

535
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,160
security clearances, foreign ownership control and influence mitigation measures, information

536
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,160
system cyber security oversight and other activities related to protecting classified

537
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,920
and controlled unclassified national security information and related technology, end quote.

538
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,840
See on screen now an ATEC security specialist role for Dugway detailing an Indusec position.

539
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,920
These responsibilities are listed for this role, including one such task, which is to

540
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,680
provide backup as the alternate special security officer for sensitive compartmented information

541
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,600
SEI programs.

542
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,240
Moving forward, investigating industrial security alongside UAP legacy program installations

543
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,520
will be paramount to my research.

544
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,840
Anyways, MS observed a saucer, roughly 10 feet tall and 20 feet in circumference.

545
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,360
The craft was hovering 10 to 12 inches off the ground.

546
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,680
The disc had no seams or fasteners and appeared to be made out of one piece and featured a

547
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,000
brushed metal appearance.

548
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,520
Around the craft were six lab technicians.

549
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,840
I believe these to be ATEC and Battelle Memorial Institute scientists, and more on this later.

550
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,200
MS believed this craft was in the process of being dismantled due to a bottom section

551
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,160
of the saucer being removed featuring a conical structure.

552
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,360
This conical section appeared to be floating and was almost independent of the craft.

553
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,680
One cannot help but draw parallels to Bob Lazar's drawn extraterrestrial reactor model

554
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,000
that he claimed served as the propulsion mechanism for the sports model flying saucer.

555
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,240
Appearing by the craft was a flat screen television type of electronic, displaying a mapping system.

556
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,120
Yeah, there is nothing on it, not a seam, not anything almost like it was like just casted.

557
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,400
Yeah, like if you said it 3D printed, but yeah, it's flawless is what I can say.

558
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,600
It's not that you, like nowadays, there's no way to replicate it for us.

559
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,720
I don't know if they were going to get ready to move it or whatever, but they had it broke down.

560
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,000
A lot of it was broke down.

561
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,320
That bottom section was open where you could kind of see into that component area.

562
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:37,360
That triangle, it's like it's floating, like it's generating a power.

563
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:46,520
I don't know, like a lot of everything happened very, very quickly and just trying to take in everything as fast as I could.

564
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,840
That section is basically doing its own thing.

565
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:59,760
When I stand in, I don't know if you're careless with something or just, that's what I said.

566
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:07,400
Is it in transition to where it's like, you guys have it out in this building out in the middle of nowhere,

567
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,920
but then you have military vehicles around, you have regular civilian vehicles around,

568
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:18,440
but if this thing's on its own power doing its own thing, what are you guys going to be doing with it?

569
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,840
You guys going to move it underground, more stuff going on, or if you've taken what you wanted.

570
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,040
MS was taken by the guards to the nearby Ditto Technical Center to the Garrison building

571
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,240
where two men in civilian clothing immediately began interrogating him.

572
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,120
The men were clad in black suits and MS guessed these individuals to be FBI or CIA.

573
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:46,080
Quite possibly, these men could also be the infamous alleged NSA men in black treat.

574
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,720
For six hours, MS was harassed and interrogated.

575
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,560
The entire duration MS maintained he had no idea what he saw and he was just doing his job.

576
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,480
Eventually, he was let go.

577
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,360
I didn't say a word of these guys when they sat me down.

578
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,080
So I don't know if they knew that I saw something.

579
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,880
I don't know how they, you know what I mean?

580
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,760
But we, I still worked out there, so I still had a confidential agreement with them.

581
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,520
I still had all that, but I don't know where it would stand nowadays.

582
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,000
In the months and years following the incident, MS would discuss his encounter with family

583
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,120
and friends and ask around to find more.

584
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,800
MS reached out to various individuals affiliated with Dugway, including one such person.

585
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,440
MS stated, quote, I reached out to him and got him to talk about my situation by accident,

586
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,200
end quote.

587
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:40,400
This individual, pseudonym GP, worked in legacy operations at Dugway and possibly still does today.

588
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,560
GP was a senior chemist involved in Dugway's UAP legacy programs, both above ground and

589
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,520
in the subterranean facility, where he claimed a light rail system connected the Dugway

590
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,480
Dumb to numerous others around the country.

591
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,200
GP commented little about himself.

592
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,960
He primarily discussed with MS what he went through at Avery.

593
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,120
What we do know about GP according to MS is he is a DOD chemist by degree and was moved

594
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,320
after being promoted to work in UAP legacy programs.

595
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,080
MS lost connection with GP when he left C Martin in 2014, but we are attempting to get

596
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,080
in contact with him today.

597
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,120
Often when discussing legacy program operations, we discuss research and development.

598
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,960
Engineers, physicists, military brass, the discussion of a chemist is indeed intriguing.

599
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,000
However, high level DOD chemists involved with technologies of unknown origin would most

600
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,920
certainly be stationed at Dugway, the nation's premier chemical and biological testing facility.

601
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,720
What exactly did GP do at Dugway?

602
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,760
This is unknown, but speculating possibly his position could have seen him operating with

603
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,280
chemistry concepts surrounding the craft's propulsion system.

604
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,600
Analyzing biologics, studying metallurgy, the list is truly endless, but GP did have enough

605
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,160
knowledge to inform MS of the mapping system he saw near the craft.

606
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,440
And you'd almost have coordinates on there is what I can describe.

607
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,480
So the way that that's set up to me is what it looked like in mapping system.

608
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,120
When I talked to the gentleman that was over top of a lot of that stuff out there,

609
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:30,240
he said they're basically able to put on that system two points of references or whatever

610
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,040
they're going to do on reference points and basically generate a wormhole and drop through.

611
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:43,040
And so that's where he says that interstellar travel is how they get from point A to point B

612
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,920
so quickly.

613
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,080
In short, GP stated the craft was extraterrestrial and operated via gravity displacement but

614
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,680
wouldn't come at further.

615
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,080
Now MS received confirmation from both GP and a current railroad co-worker of a massive

616
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,560
underground facility beneath Dugway.

617
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,400
The co-worker even claimed to have assisted in digging out the tunneling system beneath DPG.

618
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,040
MS and myself are currently setting up time to meet with this individual as well.

619
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:17,760
Deep underground military bases, DUMs, aka subterranean facilities or STFs are a keen

620
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,240
interest of mine, especially in relation to UAP legacy programs.

621
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,800
DUMs do indeed exist.

622
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,000
Quite often planned as underground ICBM facilities, underground command bunkers,

623
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,560
corporate facilities or COG continuity of government installations.

624
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,960
Indeed, even deep underground tunnel systems have been planned to connect these facilities

625
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,440
like in studies conducted by TRW.

626
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,480
Massive machines called tunnel boring machines and nuclear subterranes have historically been

627
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,760
associated with such intriguing underground work.

628
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,480
In fact, the United States National Research Council has historically published special

629
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,880
projects on the creation of DUMs, such as this 1981 and 1982 workshop on technology for

630
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,960
the design and construction of deep underground defense facilities.

631
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,400
DUMs are not our focus today besides under Dugway, but again, I have discussed such

632
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,120
underground facilities before and plan to tackle the subject fully in the future.

633
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,200
For now I'll leave you with numerous underground tunnel systems in western states

634
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,160
detailed by the US Bureau of Reclamation.

635
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,120
Many tunnel systems listed in this report feature tunnel distances of tens of thousands

636
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,040
of feet of length, tens of feet of diameter covered by hundreds or thousands of feet of earth.

637
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,400
Now many such tunnels serve as waterways and aqueducts, however it is fascinating to see

638
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,520
such a volume of massive underground tunnels.

639
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,760
It is critical to mention the Bureau of Reclamation was one of the key members

640
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:52,400
on the 1981 and 1982 joint project discussing deep underground defense facilities we mentioned above.

641
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,600
GP would state this underground facility at an undisclosed depth spanned 1300 square miles,

642
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,640
which is the size of Dugway proving ground itself.

643
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,800
The tunnels connecting Dugway to other underground installations were wide enough to

644
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,240
transport enormous aircraft such as a 747.

645
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,320
These rail systems operated off of magnetics, popularly referred to as maglev trains.

646
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,840
It's 1300 square miles underneath and then there's a light rail system is what he said.

647
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,280
He goes that light rail system is connected to every base in the nation and can transport the

648
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,480
president's plane basically anywhere they need to without putting it in the air.

649
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,320
Maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetics rather than employing wheels.

650
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:44,000
Maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad systems including higher speeds,

651
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,280
superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, improved gradient handling

652
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,160
and lower noise, but are much more expensive compared to traditional systems.

653
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,280
Maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour.

654
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,880
Now the implementation of maglev train systems connecting dumps is often seen as conspiracy.

655
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,600
However, this is an incorrect assumption.

656
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:13,600
In 1986, FFRDC Los Alamos National Labs published a study titled, quote,

657
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:19,120
sub saline, a nuclear powered melt tunneling concept for high speed lunar subsurface

658
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,960
transportation tunnels, end quote.

659
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,000
The intriguing study discussed the creation of subsurface lunar tunnels connecting manned

660
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,680
installations that would feature maglev or other high speed train transportation systems.

661
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,280
And while discussing specifics of the dump, I must once again state I am not releasing

662
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,960
any classified information.

663
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,880
Everything discussed from here on out is all public domain.

664
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,000
The entrance to the subterranean facility is accessible from a tiny building in the middle

665
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,520
of the West Desert Test Center near German Village, Dugway.

666
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,600
According to GP, the entrance is solely an elevator to take personnel to the installation.

667
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:04,960
This entrance does not supply the Dugway Dumb with materials, food, supplies, logistics, etc.

668
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,000
Instead, the Dumb is internally supplied from tunnels connecting the base to other subterranean

669
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,040
facilities.

670
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,880
When I last discussed MS and UFO witnesses redacted list, I did not cover the supposed

671
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,840
entrance to the Dugway subterranean facility.

672
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,200
Since covering MS's story, Stephen Greer has taken it upon himself to leak this supposed

673
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,640
entrance himself.

674
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:33,360
See on screen now the critical update displaying the Dugway Dumb entrance on the DPI archive.

675
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,400
As mentioned above, this remote entrance is indeed on Dugway's West Desert Test Center

676
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,840
and is quite close to the Avery Technical Center and Michael Army Airfield, while lying

677
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:48,960
between properties considered as Air Force lease rentals on Dugway-proving ground.

678
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,000
Analyzing Google Earth historical imagery, it appears this entrance was constructed sometime

679
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
between 1993 and 2006.

680
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,000
It could however be much older, as satellite resolution does not allow us to see clearly

681
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,440
at these older dates.

682
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:09,040
According to GP, much of the Dugway Dumb operations reside under nearby Granite Peak,

683
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,160
which sits just west of the alleged entrance in Avery and Ditto areas.

684
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,800
What is quite interesting to me is the fact that 388th Range Squadron out of Hill and

685
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,440
Michael Army Airfield runs multiple sites on and just north of the mountain.

686
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,080
I'd like to focus specifically on the Mini-Mute stations 10 and 2.

687
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,360
Mini-Mutes are threat emitter systems commonly utilized to train pilots to recognize and

688
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,080
respond to various enemy radar threats.

689
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,280
One must wonder if the Granite Peak South Station has entrances to or interactions

690
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,160
with a supposed facility under the mountain.

691
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,600
MS's disclosures are truly astonishing, and I must preface I am speculating here,

692
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,320
but from MS's testimony, a strong thesis can be extracted.

693
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:02,000
MS stumbled upon a joint army and USAF MRTFB UFO Legacy operation operating between ATEC

694
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,920
and the 388th Range Squadron, with the aid of white coat contractors such as Battelle Memorial

695
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,200
Institute and Jacob Solutions, more on them later.

696
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,200
This program operates above and beneath Dugway Proving Ground.

697
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,240
The clandestine program utilizes the Avery Technical Center's internal rail system

698
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,760
to transport non-human craft and materials onto unmarked secretive Avery buildings such as the

699
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,040
test operations and classified storage buildings.

700
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,640
Program scientists and the 388th Range Squadron utilize the southern part of the Utah test

701
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,760
and training range to test extraterrestrial vehicles or alien reproduction vehicles.

702
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,960
This would operate similarly to what witness Ed described with the joint UFO reverse engineering

703
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,840
program between the Edwards 412 test wing and Nevada test and training range.

704
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,600
The program also utilizes top chemistry and biology subject matter experts from ATEC and

705
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,520
DPG's chemical and biological defense program to either study biologics or engage with any

706
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,160
relevant aspects of non-human craft.

707
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,680
The Dugway DUM communicates and operates alongside other DUM locations across the continental

708
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,960
United States, likely hidden within and below major military installations and MRTFBs.

709
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,080
A truly incredible thesis, but one that can be reasonably constructed based upon the testimony

710
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,800
of MS in study of Dugway Proving Ground.

711
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,480
Lastly, I just want to briefly touch on some contractor operations at Dugway.

712
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,160
Remember, MS claimed over half of Dugway's operations related to contracting work.

713
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:47,360
In fiscal year 2013, according to the GAO, Dugway's West Desert test range saw about 77%

714
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:53,920
of acknowledged work conducted for the CBDP, Chemical Biological Defense Program Enterprise.

715
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:00,480
Now, what contractor might come to mind that deals in depth with chemical and biological concepts?

716
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,520
That's right, Battelle Memorial Institute.

717
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,920
I have covered Battelle at length before, including their project STORC, which was

718
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,280
tasked by USG to study UAP, parallel but independent to Project Blue Book.

719
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,000
I have also investigated Battelle and their curious links to nickel titanium alloys,

720
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,400
which may just have been the shape memory alloy recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash.

721
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,040
I highly recommend viewing that project.

722
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,320
Battelle runs a host of biochem facilities, including the Battelle National Biodefense

723
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,800
Institute at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

724
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,760
This location has recently become entwined with UFO lore as a possible location where

725
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,160
non-human biologics are stored.

726
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,840
There is additionally now the alleged infamous exobiospheric organism molecular biologist

727
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,680
Reddit whistleblower testimony focused on this Battelle location.

728
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,720
But these claims are absent from this investigation as they require much more research.

729
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,200
To add further intrigue, at Fort Detrick,

730
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,520
Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,

731
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,880
FFRDC, for the Department of Homeland Security.

732
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,440
Specifically, the DHS, Undersecretary for Science and Technology.

733
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,520
I would once again like to draw attention to a primary thesis of this channel that

734
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,080
FFRDC and UARC often act as project managers,

735
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:27,920
serving as subject matter experts performing R&D work in joint USG and contractor UAP legacy programs.

736
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,400
And remember how we previously discussed the CBDP programs at Dugway.

737
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:38,480
While analyzing this joint multinational and interagency CBDP Test and Evaluation

738
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:44,800
Partners chart, we can see Dugway and Battelle are both listed as select few program locations.

739
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,120
In fact, the West Desert Test Center and Fort Detrick's National Interagency

740
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,760
Biodefense Campus at which Battelle operates are additionally quite intimate,

741
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:00,480
serving as two of four of CBDP's primary research and development and test and evaluation facilities.

742
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,280
Now, I know that's a lot, but Battelle has historically also worked closely with Dugway,

743
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,760
including operating the Chemical and Biological Defense Information Analysis Center, CBIC,

744
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,120
that operates at Dugway. According to excellent UFO researcher Anthony Bregalia,

745
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,400
Battelle additionally has a design slash build division with capabilities for creating laboratories

746
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,320
and other specialized facilities. In one article, Bregalia referenced multiple open source documents

747
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,800
that discussed Battelle's facility design and construction management work at Dugway.

748
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,680
According to these documents, Battelle has engineered enclosed testing facilities and sealed

749
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,680
structures at DPG that according to one technical report, quote,

750
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,040
meet stringent containment standards, providing a degree of protection that has never been achieved

751
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,120
before, end quote. Battelle's facility design services also include specialized locations such as

752
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,720
clean rooms. I must reference back to the testimony of MS and the clean room that held the UFO.

753
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,840
Perhaps a full investigation into Battelle's construction work at DPG is warranted.

754
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,640
DPG and Fort Detrick's connections with each other and Battelle are quite interesting,

755
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,240
but this is where things get downright strange. The director of Dugway's West Desert Test Center

756
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,720
is one Mr. Ryan W. Harris. Harris is, quote, responsible for the overall planning, directing,

757
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,080
and evaluating all aspects of work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition

758
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,440
test and training programs executed by the test center, end quote. Harris received a bachelor's

759
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,120
in chemical engineering and served in the army as a chemical officer. In the year 2000, Harris

760
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,560
would accept a project manager position working with Battelle at Dugway. This Battelle work saw

761
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:48,160
Harris overseeing several testing and training programs, and in 2004, Harris would accept a

762
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:54,000
project manager position with Dugway and work his way all the way up the ranks until 2012,

763
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,240
where he achieved the position as WTC test director, where he now evaluates all aspects of

764
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,240
the work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition test and training programs executed

765
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:12,240
by the test center. Interesting how a Battelle project manager becomes director of an MRTFB

766
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:18,240
where witnesses have claimed a UAP legacy program employing DOD chemists takes place.

767
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,000
But we don't stop there. Meet US Army chemical engineering core member Greg Frank. Frank served

768
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,320
as a chemist for the chemical laboratory division at Dugway Proving Ground from 1984 to 1985,

769
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:35,040
quote. He directed and performed chemical studies and developed procedures for chemical

770
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:40,800
testing and analysis utilizing modern analytical instrumentation, end quote. While serving as

771
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,920
test officer, Frank would branch out into numerous vehicle and chemical munition programs,

772
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,160
developing material test plans and test operational plans. When he left service in 1985,

773
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,880
Frank joined Battelle as a project manager and principal investigator where he, quote,

774
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,080
managed both the technical and financial aspects of numerous projects in the areas of chemical

775
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:08,880
and biological defense, end quote. As of 2008, Frank operated as executive vice president for Battelle

776
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,960
Science and Technology International and is responsible for over 5,000 scientists, engineers,

777
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,840
and supporting staff. But believe it or not, these are not the only connections we can make with

778
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:26,880
WDTC leadership and Battelle. We can also take a keen look at Anders Weiborg, former director of

779
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,800
Special Programs Division at the West Desert Test Center. Now working for the DOE, Weiborg once

780
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:38,720
served at Dugway, ensuring execution of daily operations within the test center. Before working

781
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:44,640
at Dugway, Weiborg worked at Battelle, serving as a test director responsible for TNE of chemical

782
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,400
and biological defense equipment. Battelle and Dugway share intimate connections, likely myriad

783
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,760
more than we have just scratched today. Other contractors at Dugway are of extreme interest

784
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,440
as well and will likely serve as suspects of future investigations, such as Jacob Solutions,

785
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:08,480
who performs range testing and lab services at WDTC. This contractor operates a premium facility at

786
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,480
Dugway Ditto and sees strong ties to its board of directors and the Carlisle Group. However,

787
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,320
due to the intense focus of Dugway on biochem weapons programs, Battelle will remain our primary

788
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:27,040
suspect in UAP legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground. Hey guys, it's Gerb and I'd like to

789
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,240
thank you all so much for joining me today as we took this extended look into Dugway Proving Ground.

790
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,960
Now, why did we partake in this investigation? Well, for one, something I've noticed and I'm

791
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:46,880
sure many other have is discussion of Dugway around UFOs and legacy programs are quite intertwined.

792
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:54,160
However, there is barely any other discussion or research or claims or testimony involving Dugway.

793
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:59,760
I think the perfect example of this is the beginning quest TV video featuring Nick Pope

794
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,040
talking about Area 51 to Area 52. This entire 10-15 minute video on YouTube,

795
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,960
of course, the link will be in the description, discusses Area 51 and Dugway and talks about

796
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:17,520
it being the new Area 51. This video even features words from Richard Dolan. However,

797
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:24,560
zero evidence or testimony or anything is presented here. So after having the testimony of MS,

798
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:30,240
after having some of the words of Stephen Greer, A.H., A.J. Kratok and others, I thought it very

799
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:36,320
pertinent to actually dive into Dugway. Now, I have reason to believe that Dugway is indeed a

800
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:42,400
premier legacy reverse engineering material exploitation program. So I wanted to sift through

801
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,880
all of this information and present an argument, especially as we started to look

802
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,320
into Dugway structure and how Dugway is comprised of two major range test facility bases, a huge

803
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:01,120
piece of this investigation. As we know with the testimony of Ed, his claims of a reverse

804
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:07,840
engineering program covered two Air Force MRTFBs, the Edwards 412 test wing and the Nevada test and

805
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:14,160
training range. Dugway gives us an interesting look because due to the testimony of MS, we can

806
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:20,800
conclude of a joint reverse engineering program versus two branches of the military MRTFBs,

807
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:26,960
the Army's West Desert Test Center and the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range. This,

808
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,760
of course, then involves Army ATEC and their Joint Chemical Biological Defense Program

809
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:39,680
and the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby Hill Air Force Base. I tried to do many connections

810
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,400
between the 388th RANS, Range Squadron as it's listed, and the Edwards 412 test wing. Unfortunately,

811
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,280
there is very little to chew on there. However, I do think the argument presented here is strong

812
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:58,400
enough and there's enough valuable data and listed data here for any policymaker or any individual

813
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:06,960
with influence to conduct a comprehensive analysis of MS and others' claims. Now, of course, twice

814
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,800
in this video around the stiff sub-training facility location, I listed a disclaimer that

815
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:19,920
I was using only publicly available information. Now, I do this because when all the way back

816
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,920
when discussing NSWC Crane and the testimony of RA, or we now know Randy Anderson, I caught a little

817
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,640
bit of flak and a little bit of fright for mentioning Crane and the possibility that this could be a

818
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,160
catastrophic disclosure and could be a breach of national security due to this being an underground

819
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,040
location. Therefore, when discussing the dumb locations, I needed to preface by saying this

820
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,480
information was all public domain. And I thank you, Stephen Greer, for leaking that on the DPI

821
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,480
archive because that finally gave me a chance to talk about these locations. Seen as the last time

822
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,240
I covered MS, I was privy to these locations but did not think it appropriate to list them. But

823
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,320
Greer took it upon himself to list Granite Peak and the alleged dumb location by German Village

824
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:11,120
himself. So thank you for that. And I must state once again, as I did in the last project,

825
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:18,800
do not under any circumstances go looking for that location. Dugway Proving Ground is protected

826
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:24,800
land and protected airspace. These are military assets, do not go to the location. Okay, if that

827
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:30,720
is a location to a deep underground military base, which I highly wager it is, do not go there.

828
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,640
Okay, let's make that very clear. Just do not for your own safety, please.

829
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:45,600
Don't. So there's other data to discuss surrounding Dugway. As we saw with the Dugway

830
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:53,120
history, there's not much linking Dugway to UAP legacy programs, unlike something like Edwards,

831
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:59,280
or Norton, or even China Lake or White Sands Missile Range. One of the biggest features of

832
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:04,240
this project was of course the garrison crash, and then some of the claims of Area 51 being

833
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:09,200
moved to Area 52. Conversely, for a place like Edwards, we have the story of Kent Selen and the

834
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:15,200
ARV and, you know, numerous craft and operations being incited at Dugway. There is more in this

835
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,080
video. I wasn't able to include one such story is the testimony of current Air Force Colonel

836
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:26,240
Weinbrenner. Now Weinbrenner has a very interesting story as if anybody can remember back to the

837
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:33,440
Jesse Michaels interview with James Fox filmmaker James Fox. Fox discusses a film of the

838
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:40,320
Holloman Air Force base landing and how his friend Alan or yes, Alan Sandler viewed this film and

839
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:47,680
told Fox about it. Well, back in the 70s, Alan Sandler and his co video producer Robert Emanager

840
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:54,240
were attempting to make a documentary on UAP. This is when they were sequestered by two

841
01:09:54,240 --> 01:10:00,560
enlisted Air Force personnel and shown the Holloman film and were licensed to utilize

842
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,760
the film. But that licensing was pulled soon thereafter. One of these individuals was Colonel

843
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:12,080
Weinbrenner. Now on Colonel Weinbrenner's deathbed to close friends and families, he allegedly

844
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:19,520
said that Utah is where the alien bodies are stored. Now that's a very interesting disclosure

845
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,080
where the alien bodies are stored. This would be a very interesting place for this to be

846
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,640
Dugway. You know, of course, quite often Fort Detrick is talked about. I do believe Lou mentioned

847
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:34,960
this in imminent as well, but as a place for biologics to be stored. And this is where

848
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:42,560
much chemical and biological defense systems are ran. And there's extreme ties to Dugway

849
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:50,160
with Fort Detrick. So there's also interesting data to explore of Dugway being not just a craft

850
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:58,480
exploitation program on the UTTR, but also a biologic study area. Could this be where biologics

851
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:03,360
autopsies take place where biological tissue is studied quite possibly. But this would be kept

852
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:09,040
under wraps as any chemical and biological data and information and study is incredibly

853
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,920
secretive and incredibly classified. As we've seen with Dugway, you know, Dugway's projects are

854
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:22,160
not spoken of often and 77% of Dugway's programs according to the GAO are conducted for the chemical

855
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:28,880
and biological defense program. I would like to know what everybody else here thought. And while

856
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,320
you're leaving your comments, let's also tuck into the testimony of MS. Of course, I had talked to

857
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,440
MS all the way back in June of 2024. And those are the clips I have used for the conversation

858
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:45,440
in this video exploration. I do plan to interview MS again, hopefully in person,

859
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:53,920
if that can be arranged. Hopefully, that can also be done with GP and the individual who claimed he

860
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:59,680
helped build the railroad system under Dugway. Such an investigation and interview with these

861
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,760
three individuals would truly be consequential. You know, I find a lot of value in MS's testimony

862
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,880
not because of him being reached out to by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which he

863
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:17,280
indeed was. I said in the project that he had received, I have seen the outreach from these

864
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:25,120
individuals wishing for him to go to the Hill to testify, but also because his testimony at Ditto

865
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:31,760
and Avery leads to such fruitful research. As we've seen with Avery, it has numerous,

866
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:38,240
numerous fascinating buildings that could be used for such operations, classified storage,

867
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,760
test operations, photo O&M, internal rail system to the Dugway deep underground facility,

868
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,160
just a very fascinating testimony to cover. And I must add, with the Dugway Dumb being just some

869
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:56,400
small type of concrete facility out in the desert, just serving as an elevator to a Dumb,

870
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:04,720
where it's this entrance point doesn't serve to transport vehicles or armor or logistics or weaponry

871
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:12,240
or food or anything but personnel traveling down. I must be quite plain here. In my videos,

872
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,400
I don't generally like to say, well, a source told me this, a source told me this, a source told me

873
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:24,080
this, but I do have a friend that has formerly served in the United States Army. This was in the

874
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:32,960
early 2010s that has talked to me about traveling in stiffs, subterranean facilities. I cannot reveal

875
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:40,080
these locations, but he said he traveled across state lines between stiffs in an underground

876
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:47,840
rail system that went so fast, it reminded him of flying in a plane of which he has great fear.

877
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:54,400
So the fear of a plane's acceleration is what he felt in the train. What was interesting to me

878
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:01,200
is the location to which he traveled. The entrance way to that location was a small,

879
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:08,640
what you could call janitorial building or kind of potable water treatment building in the middle

880
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:15,360
of nowhere. Just a small building nestled in a location that accessing these buildings took

881
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,560
you to an elevator to a deep underground facility. This is not the only individual I've talked to

882
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,440
who has accessed a stiff or a dumb, maybe we'll call them stiffs because it carries a little

883
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,840
more weight. I've talked to numerous people who have this is why this topic carries such great

884
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:36,320
interest to me, especially because dumps or stiffs are indeed real. As I said, oftentimes for corporate

885
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:43,040
facilities such as AT&T, who at least in the 90s and 2000s housed many underground server banks and

886
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,080
ICBM storage locations underground and possibly underwater under ocean surface as well,

887
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:55,760
as well as continuity of government COG installation COG continuity of government

888
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,320
reminds me a lot of when Colonel John B. Alexander, who isn't the most trustworthy in my opinion,

889
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,080
talked about Majestic 12 being real and serving as a continuity of government type institution.

890
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,400
This also reminds me of what also reminds me of continuity of government

891
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:16,560
is the description of the dugway done by GP, which can talk about transporting the president's plane

892
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,480
to anywhere in the country. So I hope everybody enjoyed this dive into dugway. I'd like to know

893
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,920
what everybody thinks. This was a very important project to me because, you know, just as in every

894
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:36,480
single video I discuss SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, FFRDCs or UARCs, I can now incorporate

895
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,320
such testimony of major range test facility bases and TNE, Test and Evaluation, Research and

896
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:48,240
Development Test and Evaluation, RD, TNE into my projects. Remember, guys, when he left service,

897
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:56,400
Witness Ed served on the Pentagon for Air Force RD, TNE. And this is where he claims that $34

898
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:01,760
and $40 billion went missing to non-authorized transfer of authority funds in fiscal year,

899
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:08,480
I think 2013 and 2014. So doge, if you're watching, go look at Air Force and possibly Army RD, TNE.

900
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,680
Anyways, what else can we discuss, guys? More interesting projects coming down the way.

901
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,680
As I say in every project, I do in fact have a Patreon if you want to support the channel.

902
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,520
I don't gatekeep any content, only support what you think the channel is worth. And please

903
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,080
remember to like and subscribe, guys. These investigations are my heart and soul. They do

904
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:33,360
take a long time. So any comments about your thoughts on the investigation is much appreciated.

905
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,360
If you've noticed some oddness with the old I here, I'm dealing with some problems because that is

906
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,760
what happens when you grapple with individuals who do not wash their training equipment enough,

907
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:50,240
do not wash their rash guards. So thank you to that person who decided to wrestle with a very

908
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:56,560
disgusting rash guard. I really appreciate that. But I'm also quite elated, guys, because

909
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,440
anybody who watches the channel and has interacted with me knows I am an Alexander Volkanovsky

910
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:07,440
superfan. And our glorious king has just been booked to fight Diego Lopez, blockhead Diego Lopez

911
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:14,400
at UFC 314 in Miami come April. So I am elated about that, that the dangerous power puncher

912
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:21,680
Toporio is moving up to lightweight and vacating the belt. This is sweet Christmas to me. So let

913
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,120
me know what you guys think about the investigation, guys. Please remember to like and subscribe,

914
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,520
and I will see everybody on the next show. Thank you.
