WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty, you know, on 12-hour shifts.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7pm to 7am.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
probably in chairs or hanging out in the back.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
We get a call on the radio that there's, you know, either unexplained

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
or unauthorized something about flare activity in the desert.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
You know, maybe four, three to four miles out, maybe five.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
We come over a hill, we're yanking the trailer behind us, you know,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
We come over a hill and all five of us see it.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle,

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
And possibly some kind of venting on the sides,

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That was there hanging in the sky.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
I say hanging because there was enough wind for something even, you know,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I know aerodynamics, something that if it was thin enough,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
maybe it could hover slightly.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
So this is what it would look like if you were looking straight up at it.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Of course, that's not the angle, it was more, you know,

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I don't want to use that.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
A soup bowl going forward with no light emitting from here,

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
yellow, yellowish, whiteish,

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
or kind of like a ball sphere had been embedded into the underside.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Accompanying it, we're about 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
and five to six can't remember exactly vehicles.

02:12.000 --> 02:22.000
Look like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks jacked up all black, all matte,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
some with canopies, some with antennas.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
This is all coming in a flash, right?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
The minute we came up over about half of them,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
maybe 15 came running up the hill towards us,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
V-formations with guns.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, right up harsh language.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Get your f***ing heads down, get your f***ing heads down.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Get your f***ing heads down.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You know, not shooting.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
But looking like they're ready to.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
You know, very close to our heads as if they didn't want us to look at anything.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
We felt, my initial reaction was we f***ed up,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
found something that we shouldn't be involved in

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
and I'm just going to comply because I'm scared.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
On this channel, I investigate UFO whistleblowers,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
UFO crash retrieval cases,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
and UFO legacy program operations that exist somewhere between elements

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
of the United States Department of Defense,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
intelligence communities, colossal defense contractors,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
and semi-private R&D experts called

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Federally-funded research and development centers.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
One of my personal favorite topics to study

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
is the concept of alien reproduction vehicles.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Human-made aerospace vehicles that range from replicas of non-human craft

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
to prosaic airframes and designs

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
employing one or more aspects of non-human technologies.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
The term ARV was coined by the now infamous Brad S,

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
an industrial designer who witnessed three man-made flying saucer vehicles

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
called quote-unquote flux liners at a classified section of the 1988

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Norton Air Force Base Air Show,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
which were described as copycat vehicles

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
employing highly exotic propulsion systems and craft designs,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
while still featuring F-4 Phantom jump seats and sloped-on paint.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
As recently as 2024,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
whistleblower Matthew Brown proposed the Immaculate Constellation Reports,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
which detailed a special access program

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
targeted with performing data acquisition of video,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
satellite imagery, etc.,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
on UFOs and quote-unquote reproduction vehicles.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Such cases involved reproduction vehicles

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
detailed as silent, enormous black triangles

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
observed by U.S. Indo-Paccom, or U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I have discussed numerous cases surrounding alien reproduction vehicles,

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
including the ever-complex and awe-inspiring flux liner,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
the whistleblower testimony of Ed,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
who served as an electronics warfare detector

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
at the Edwards 412 test wing,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
where he claimed he served as the mediary between scientists

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
and test pilots of reverse-engineered UFO craft.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And I have devoted an entire documentary

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
to exploring man-made reproduction vehicle triangular craft.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
In this project in question,

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
I argued why I believe many, perhaps not all,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
but many triangular UFO sightings are in fact man-made vehicles

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
that harness exotic technologies and concepts.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Specific craft covered were seemingly prototype iterations of triangles

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
with varying features seen worldwide from the 1970s to 1990s.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Crescendoing in the 1989 Belgian Triangle UFO wave,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
as well as the XF-131 Super Sentinel,

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
which famously made its way onto the X-Files Season 1, Episode 1.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
No. Planes built using UFO technology.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
After forensic artist Bill McDonald drew the copycat vehicle

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
in a Denny's in Antelope Valley in 1992.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Based upon the first-hand testimony from four engineers,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
two from Lockheed out of the Hellendale radar cross-section plans

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
and two from Northrop Grumman out of the Tejon radar cross-section plans.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
The most famous mention of reverse-engineered craft came from Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
who detailed the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
The pride of U.S. Aerospace, whose propulsion system was reverse-engineered by Sandia

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
in Lawrence Livermore National Labs.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Two federally funded research and development centers,

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
whose pilots hailed from the U.S. Navy and Edwards 412 Test Wing,

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
whose engineering was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne Ryan,

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
and whose program was managed by three of six of the U.S. Big Six intelligence agencies,

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
the NRO, NSA, and CIA.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
But today, I am thrilled to announce I have sat down with a first-hand UFO witness

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
who since he first approached David Grush in early 2025

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
is dead set on swearing his testimony before Congress.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
A former U.S. Marine whose testimony ties into this entire long-winded intro

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
as well as other whistleblower testimonies I have covered,

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
specifically Ed from the Edwards 412 Test Wing and U.S. Marines Jonathan Waganth and Michael Herrera.

07:54.000 --> 08:02.000
Meet Roderick Castle III, a veteran and sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 to 1999,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
who now works with veterans suffering from PTSD.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Castle served with the VMA-513, the Flying Nightmares,

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
an AV-8B Harrier Squadron stationed out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona,

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
leading a team of six to eight Marines in aviation ordinance while also training as a helicopter flight medic.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
I have recorded an entire interview with Castle detailing his harrowing experience

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
of what I wager is a triangular ARV, an accompanying black operation's unacknowledged Special Mission Unit

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
encountered a little too close for comfort here in the continental United States.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Viewers of my channel know me and know who I am,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
so a week before the interview with Castle releases,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
we will today exhaustively explore his testimony

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
in place the who, what, when, where, and why to his harrowing encounter.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
To some, Castle's testimony may seem simple and quite similar to that of Waganth and Herrera.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
While on duty, a Marine encounters an all-black team with advanced gear and weaponry,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
featuring no insignia or identification,

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
there might be a craft-defying all-logic hovering motionless nearby seemingly operated by humans,

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
but the Marine is forcibly detained, threatened, and met with reprisals.

09:27.000 --> 09:36.000
But to me, Castle's brief but powerful testimony offers us an unparalleled look into U.S. legacy program operations,

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
how these UFO paramilitary groups operate alongside other blue, a.k.a. friendly assets,

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
and a greater understanding that the U.S. does indeed employ triangular craft

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
that can defy all logic for clandestine aerospace applications.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
So please look at this video as a part one of two,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
the investigation of Castle should not be viewed without the interview of Castle.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
With all that out of the way, let's dive in, but last thing here,

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
I know some viewers of my work can get tripped up with so many uses of acronyms.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
So guys, today we are diving into military programs,

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
so please expect a tremendous amount of acronyms.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I will try to relist all acronyms used in the video description,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
so please reference there if you get tripped up,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
but with that out of the way, let's begin.

10:41.000 --> 10:54.000
Roderick John Castle III entered into service at the United States Marine Corps in 1994,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
and by his retirement, Castle earned the rank of Sergeant, or an E-5.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Castle's primary MOS, or Military Occupational Specialty, was a 6531.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Her aircraft ordinance technician, Castle served at the MAG-13,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
or Marine Aircraft Control Group 13,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
of the 3D MAW, or Third Marine Aircraft Wing,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
stationed at MCAS Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
and yes, I know, we're already getting into the acronyms.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Now real fast, I previously discussed Yuma Proving Ground,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
or US Army MRTFB, or Major Range and Test Facility Base

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
in regards to UFO Legacy Program Operations.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
23 US MRTFBs exist,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
8 Army, 6 Navy, 7 Air Force, and 2 Defense Agency.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
These include Edwards 412 Test Wing,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
NAWC Patuxent River,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
and the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Command,

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Fort Wachuka, and the West Desert Test Center, and more.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
One of my prevailing and prominent theories regarding UFO Legacy Programs

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
is the usage of these critical core MRTFBs

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
for UFO research, development, tests, and evaluation.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
This includes everything from craft storage,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
accompanying deep underground military bases beneath MRTFBs,

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
and utilization of restricted airspace for test flight

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
of recovered or reverse engineered craft.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
MCAS, out of which CASEL operated, is not part of Yuma Proving Ground,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
therefore it is not part of the MRTFB.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
In fact, while CASEL's experience involved a coordinated US Marine Corps experiment,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I wager the USMC is quite unlikely to run and operate

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
UFO Legacy Program Operations,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
and keep this in mind as we progress in our investigation.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
While I can present ample testimony, evidence, files, and research

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
that the US Army, Air Force, and Navy

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
operate siloed UFO Legacy Programs in conjunction with the US Big Six Intelligence Agencies,

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
I can find no such evidence even suggesting USMC engages with the UFO portfolio.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
CASEL served with the VMA-513, nicknamed the Flying Nightmares,

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
a USMC attack squadron known for use of its AV-8B Harrier jets.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
And towards the tail end of its service trained as a helicopter flight medic.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Harriers are fascinating pieces of technology.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
These intriguing craft are known as VTOL, Vertical Takeoff and Landing Jets,

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
while the AV-8B Harriers are known as STOVL, Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing,

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
meaning that Harriers require little to no runway to take off and can actually land vertically.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And this means Harrier jets can stand still and hover in the air,

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
thanks to their Rolls-Royce Pegasus engines equipped with four rotating nozzles

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
that can direct engine thrust quite the sight for an attack jet.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
But I mention this due to CASEL's familiarity with both Harrier jets and helicopters.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
He was well accustomed to VTOL and STOVL technology, helicopter morphology,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
and Harrier standstill flight vectoring and dynamics.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
In 1997, CASEL would take part in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
a 12-day experiment that ran from the 2nd of May 1997 to 14 May 1997

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
in Southern California out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
The Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment was at the time

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory,

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
which explored methods to increase the area of influence and combat effectiveness of Marine units

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
The Hunter Warrior Experiment operated with three primary objectives.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
One, quote,

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
The first objective area covers tactical operations on the dispersed, non-contiguous battlefield.

15:05.000 --> 15:13.000
How small units perform against a numerically superior force on a battlefield that has no front, flank, or rear areas,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
and is key component of this objective, end quote.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Two, quote,

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
The second area is command control communication computers and intelligence, and the single battle concept.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
Creating and using a shared digital communications network will be crucial in many different areas.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Experiments in C4I examine the digital network in information sharing, end quote.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And finally, three, quote,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
The third objective is enhancing fire support and improving targeting

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
to dominate the broad dispersed battlefield of the future,

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
effective and efficient use of all indirect fire is absolutely necessary, end quote.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
During Hunter Warrior's Advanced Warfighting Experiment's operations,

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
and within Hunter Warrior's AO, or area of operations, is where CASEL's experience took place.

16:02.000 --> 16:10.000
Now, if you recall in 2023, Jeremy Corbell released a video of a supposed triangle UFO over 29 palms.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Arguments persist to this day if the video depicts a craft or a group of flares,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
but that and 29 palms are not relevant to our investigation today.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
Indeed, I believe many studying CASEL's testimony would look for evidence of UFO Legacy Program operations

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
out of 29 palms Marine Station, but I vehemently disagree.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I believe that by studying the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
we can truly gain unparalleled insights into UFO Legacy Program's conduct,

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
testing, and training missions on U.S. soil.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Hang tight because after we detail CASEL's encounter,

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
we will spend a significant amount of time exploring the 1997 Hunter Warrior Experiment.

17:01.000 --> 17:10.000
We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty on 12-hour shifts.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
probably in chairs or hanging out in the back.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
We get a call on the radio that there's either unexplained or unauthorized

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
something about flare activity in the desert.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
Maybe 3 to 4 miles out, maybe 5.

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
This is the part that gets a little sketchy, but I've tried to find it on maps.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
We come over a hill or yank in the trailer behind us,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
We come over a hill and all five of us see it.

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle,

18:14.000 --> 18:21.000
meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
And possibly some kind of venting on the sides,

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
That was there hanging in the sky.

18:37.000 --> 18:47.000
So accompanying it were about 30, 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
And 5 to 6 can't remember exactly vehicles.

18:54.000 --> 19:04.000
It looked like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks, jacked up, all black, all matte.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
Some with canopies, some with antennas.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
This is all coming in a flash, right?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Enough to notice that the thing was hanging there.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
Enough to notice it was slightly turning counterclockwise.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
Perhaps there was some indentation in the center,

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
maybe some type of striation or venting on the side,

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
but these are impressions that I've had to find

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
and integrate with that initial shock and awe of seeing something like this.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
During the 2nd of March 1997 to the 14th of March 1997,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Roderick Castle with his team of 5 to 6 other Marines

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
and the VMA 513 flying nightmares

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
engaged in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting experiment

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
located in the Southern California desert.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Castle and his fellow team operated attached

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
to an experimental Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Ironically to this channel,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Castle and his fellow Marines participated in the experiment

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
as a Harrier jet crash retrieval team.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
One night during the 12 day operation,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Castle and his team were engaged

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
in overnight crash retrieval duties for Harriers.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
The Marines were sent in to investigate

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
unidentified flare activity.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
As you will see in our interview,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Castle and I have worked hard to trace almost exactly

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
where this incident took place to reduce as much ambiguity

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
and questions as possible.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Our incident occurred within a 7.5 mile radius

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
of Emerson Dry Lakebed,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
northwest of 29 Palms

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
in about 90 miles southeast of Edwards Air Force Base

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
in the Antelope Valley.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
If you know my work,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
my bet you can already guess

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
where we will be going in our investigation.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Castle and his Marines came over a hill

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
heading northwest in this area

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
and we can find multiple dirt roads

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
with varying terrain near the Emerson Dry Lakebed.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
According to the Federal Aviation Administration's

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
special use of airspace,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
this event occurred within R2501C.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I strongly recommend committing this piece of airspace to memory

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
as regular old boring discussion

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
of air traffic organizational policy

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
and restricted pieces of airspace

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
will become paramount to our investigation.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So this is what it would look like

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
if you were looking straight up at it.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Of course, that's not the angle.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
If it's more, you know,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I want to use that.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
So you only saw the underside of this, right?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
You cannot speak to what the top would like.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm going to do this faintly

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
because there's perhaps convex, right?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Going inward.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Is that what I said before?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Or concave.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Concave, yes.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Same.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
A soup bowl going forward,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
but no light emitting from here,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
but a yellow,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
a yellowish, whiteish

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
or kind of light.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
You know, nothing crazy, like psychedelic or

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
but definitely like a ball,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
a sphere had been embedded into the underside.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And that's important you say that, right?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's not just like a flush LED light.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It's not like spheres embedded into each corner.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Yeah, and the light was

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
deeper than an incandescent or an LED.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
One of the things you told me when we were talking

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
and this, the light cast,

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
didn't cast onto the ground

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
or the team or anything.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
The light wasn't cast.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
You know, not completely non-reflective,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
which it would be, you know,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
invisible basically, but

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
all this aspect, very black,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
blocking out the sky and the stars.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
You get that deep dark blue

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
in the desert sometimes.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
The moon was not,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I don't know where the moon was that night.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It must have been over one of the hills.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Coming over the hill in a Humvee,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
carrying fire suppression equipment,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
the Marines encountered an enormous,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
equilateral triangular craft

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
that measured approximately 300 feet in length,

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
hovering silently 150 to 200 feet in the air.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
The craft emitted no detectable sound,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
featured no exhaust ports,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
bolts, seams, or rivets.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
An unlike a Harrier or helicopter

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
sat stationless in the air,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
no wobbling, bobbling, or weaving,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and featured no exhaust signs

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
like one would see from a Harrier's

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
VTOL thrust engines.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
The ominous vehicle was matte black or darker

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
with no observable reflectivity

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
and featured three lights at each corner,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
bright lights, but not blinding.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
The lights were a combination of yellow,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
white, and gold,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
but oddly cast no shadow onto the ground.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Below the craft,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
an estimated 150 to 200 feet away from the castle

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
were unmarked black tactical vehicles

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and an accompanying unit

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
of approximately 30 armed men

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
in unmarked black uniforms.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Like the stories of Wagan and Herrera,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
these men bore no insignia,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
identifiable markings, flags, or name tags,

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
and the operators all spoke with American dialects.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
The vehicles seemed to be all Ford F-150

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
to F-350 types with all black canopies.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Some featured antennae on top of the canopy,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
but all vehicles were all black.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
No logos, symbols, chrome,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
or metallic reflections were visible

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
off of any of the automobiles.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Despite Castle and his fellow

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
VMA-513 Marines operating in uniform

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
with authority on U.S. soil,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
half of the unmarked operators

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
intercepted the Marines at gunpoint.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The Marines were disarmed, held at gunpoint,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
and threatened and ordered to stay silent.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
You know, so we're alert, but we're, you know,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
we're, of course, tired,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
but we don't have night vision stuff.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
This is low-tech, you know,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
we're Marines and we've been through combat training,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
but we're glorified mechanics,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
so we know we're technicians.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
So there's a handful of tactical vehicles,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
all black, and a team of about 30.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
What was the team doing?

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
Not enough time to even evaluate that,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
because the minute we came up over

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
about half of them, maybe 15,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
came running up the hill towards us,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
and V formations with guns.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
What were they armed with?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Subtype of, like, subtype machine gun.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
I'm not a guy who knows all the guns,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
but I did, I am an artist,

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
and I have found a way to use AI

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
to help me with this process.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I did send you a picture at one point,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
and maybe that could be shown.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
That's exactly what they look like.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Other than maybe, you know,

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
my picture ends up with a Caucasian skin tone at the top.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Not necessarily the case,

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
but that's the only place any type of skin

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
for any of these men might have been shown.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
We'll show it on screen,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
because of course we're working with that 3D artist

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
to recreate the scene,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
and to your specific specifications.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
So you're saying all black army helmets,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
sometimes goggles, black,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
what looks almost like a ski mask,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
black fatigues, black tactical gear,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
submachine gun.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, like, you know,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
classic black clad mercenary type.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
You know, again, I'm an artist,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
so I'm going to see things through a lens,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
sometimes through art and movies and comics,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
and these were, if you want to,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
you want to drop some evil villains

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and, you know, black clad mercenaries,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
this is what these guys look like.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah, right up harsh language.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Get your ass down, get your ass down.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Get your ass down.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You know, not shooting,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
but looking like they're ready to.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
You know, very close to our heads,

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
as if they didn't want us to look at anything.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
We felt, my initial reaction was,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
we f***ed up, we came upon something

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
that we shouldn't be involved in,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
and I'm just going to comply,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
because I'm scared.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
You know, like again, we're Marines,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
we're technicians,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
and our M16s are in the back of the truck,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
you know, in Iraq.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Right.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
You guys are there for our suppression.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Not even loaded.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We don't have magazines on it.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
We're carrying two bells.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Because you were, you know,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
for the exercise,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
harrier, crash or triple duty if needed.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
You're not there to be armed or station.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
No, no, you know, we fight if we need to fight,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
but that's not our primary job.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
So these guys are harsh language head down,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
they don't want you to see anything.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
So, and keep in mind this whole thing,

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
max four minutes, maybe three.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
That's what I want people to know too,

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
is this was, this is a flash,

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
adrenaline filled witness event.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
You know, this is something I came across accidentally.

28:36.000 --> 28:42.000
And I see it now as some very positive,

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
mostly positive thing,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
that, you know, it opened up some,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
some avenues for me,

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
but as far as thinking,

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
but something I probably would have,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
if things hadn't changed,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
maybe, you know, in the last two, three years,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
with the energy about this subject,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
the stigma I probably would have just taken

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
to my grave.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
You know, maybe told stories to excite,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
you know, my grandkids or something.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Oh, Grandpa Roder's talking about that black triangle again.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
That was the first demands, you know, out of the vehicle.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Out of the, out, out, out, out.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
Minimum language, which tells you they mean business.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And I don't know how else to say it,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
but anybody that's been there knows what it feels like

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
when you know for certain,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
this guy's probably this close from shooting you in the head.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
It's a feeling, it's a real thing that all the acid

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
in your stomach just floods you, you know,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
you're flood, you're ready to die.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
So, this was all happening at the same time,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
in multiple ways,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
because we all are affected by that trauma differently.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
So me, I might freeze,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
because I'm starting to conceptualize the whole situation.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
My other guy might get aggressive.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Another guy might run.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Did these guys, did they have any insignia,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
any name tags, any claims?

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
No, no, it's like completely black.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
On purpose, obvious.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
You know, every truck was painted matte black.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
But they spoke with American dialect, right?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
The few that I could, that I heard.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
The Puss Watson.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
And they were very, they knew what they were doing,

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
because they knew certain guys talk,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
certain guys don't, the rest, keep their mouth shut.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
So I know that your number one concern was for your life

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
and the life of your fellow Marines.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Could you tell what the rest of the convoy was doing,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
what the trucks were doing,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
what the Triangle was doing during this time?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
You know, of course, I've gone over this

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
in my head a billion times.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I got my, my kind of theories,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
but I'm not stuck on anything.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
It felt more like they were there with it.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's some kind of overwatch.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Maybe it was, why I was hovering right there, I don't know.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
After approximately two minutes,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
since first observing the craft,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
and whilst being detained by the operators,

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
the Triangle ceased its slow rotation counterclockwise,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
climbed at an angle and darted to the Northwest

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
at an extremely high rate of speed.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
And remember that direction.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
But again, this craft took off with no visible auditory

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
or optical signs of propulsion or thrust.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
I did see it zoom to the Northwest,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
which is the direction, the general direction of the road

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
at a very high rate of speed.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
Again, no, no noise, no exhaust, nothing.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Just slow descent.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
So it, it rose up a little bit and then just darted?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah, like at an angle, at an angle.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Did it curve or did it seem like the,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
the craft would be parallel to the ground?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
No, yes.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
That's important, you know.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Staying, staying like this.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
So it didn't turn at an angle, just rose up?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Yeah, like it's on some kind of,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
it needs to stay that direction.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Did it seem like there was visible acceleration

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
or did this just?

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
At first it was like a, like maybe a slow buildup,

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
that angle, and then when it hit that, to nothing.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Wow.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Like a very tiny light to nothing, but you know.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
And that's what resonates with other reports I've heard.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
It's just this rapid, rapid acceleration.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
The craft disappeared almost instantaneously and quickly.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
The black operators sprinted back down the hill,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
boarded their tactical vehicles and drove off to the northwest

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
at a high rate of speed.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
In a state of psychological shock,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
the men tried and failed to start their humvees.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
The vehicles remained inoperable for several minutes.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
They, they seem surprised as we were, but they were ready.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Cause that's what they do.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
That was the sense they're doing their job.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
The minutes the thing was gone.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
They've run back down the hill, back to their vehicles.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
They take off down that road.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Same direction as a craft.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
We pick ourselves up.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
We're the only best way I can explain is state of shock

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
after a car accident or something.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
The one younger guy who was, you know, always,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
the one that talked the most, you know, he said,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
you know, what's.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
You know, I remember that distinctly.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
It's like those first few moments after a car crash,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
that something gets embedded.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
Um, got back in the vehicle, attempted to turn the humvee on.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
It would not start at first.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Um, relatively rare.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
Um, you know, you got a, just a side switch to diesel engine.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Pretty reliable.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
It took maybe five minutes to get it going

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
and try it every minute.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
I am reminded here of Dr. Kevin Knuth

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
at the 2023 Soul Foundation,

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
where he discussed vehicle malfunctions in the presence of UFOs.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
You might recall the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
where Richard Dreyfus is in his truck investigating power outages

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
and the UFO flies over his truck and the truck stops running.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
Um, McCamble in 1983 had identified several automobile interference types.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
You get engine disruption and failure.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
The engines sometimes fail to restart in the vicinity of a UFO.

34:33.000 --> 34:40.000
And when the UFO leaves, sometimes the engine restarts.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
When I saw that in the movie, I was like, oh, this is just silly at this point.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Oh, just restart.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
You can't just, how is the UFO magically restarting the engine?

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
Um, well, if you think about the physics, you can reason through this.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
And this is what McCamble had done.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
If you have a strong enough electric field around this UFO,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
you could possibly be ionizing the air.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
How strong is this field got to be?

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
It's got to be on the order of three times ten to the six volts per meter.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
That'll short out the spark plugs in the car.

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
It'll short out the distributor cam so the car will stop running.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
But this also brings up an interesting point.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
If the VMA-513 Marines experienced vehicle failure,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
this would imply the black operators and their ground tactical vehicles

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
were equipped with countermeasures,

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
maybe similar to something like a Faraday cage

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
to deflect the electromagnetic interference produced by the triangle,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
arriving back to their quonset hut.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
The Marines were greeted by their gunnery sergeant and a warrant officer.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
The commanding officers checked on the Marines,

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
asked them about their mission and what they saw,

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
and reminded the men whatever they encountered was just simple flares,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
and to not tell others.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Um, we drive back to base our shift.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
This was like two, three.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
We finished our shift just by standing by again.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Not a lot of talking.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Back to our quonset huts.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
By 7 a.m., our gunnery sergeant and our chief warrant officer

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
was hanging out in our quonset hut, which is strange.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Marines don't do things with a lot of words.

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
They do things by presence and implying something.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Seems like they were checking in on us.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
We already knew what it was about,

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
but it's just like some flair activity out there, guys.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
It was implied we knew what they were saying.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
This is flares.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
You guys stumble across something.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You shouldn't have seen, but no big deal.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Now, it is my opinion the warrant officer and gunnery sergeant

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
were not briefed on the incident, the triangle or the black team.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
And this is because of the way USAP or unacknowledged

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
special access programs are conducted,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
which I do believe, in fact, Castle encountered.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
Therefore, these commanding officers would not have a need to know

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
about the triangle or the operation.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
Therefore, I think it is highly likely bordering on absolute certainty.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
The commanding officers were informed Marines in their command

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
had encountered USAP operations and sensitive materials

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
and were to remind their Marines to retain absolute silence

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
about their encounter.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Now, one of the most intriguing pieces here is the day

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
following the incident, Castle was subject to an anthrax booster.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Castle had, shortly before Hunter Warrior, already received a booster

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
for his already taken anthrax vaccine,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
so why another immediately after the counter?

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Indeed, DOD mandates for all US military personnel

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
to vaccinate against anthrax did not go effect until December 1997

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
and from the Gulf War in 1991 up to 1997,

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
only some troops, if necessary, were given the anthrax vaccines and boosters.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
The following day, we were called to medical

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
and given an anthrax booster, they called it.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
Now, as far as we knew, we had already been given the anthrax vaccine,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
maybe a year prior.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Right.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
It was always controversial, but we did it because we were told

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
and in those days, there was a lot of grumbling among the Marines

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
and there was usually a guy with a rifle near the medical area

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
where they're giving the anthrax, sometimes people would talk.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
So it doesn't feel like a suggestion you take?

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
Yeah, again, a Marine thing, a suggestion that we're all taking this

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
and keep your mouth shut.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Had you already received like a booster?

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Because I know that, like you said, the anthrax vaccine was already controversial.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
I know that for some servicemen, it was forced if they were overseas,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
the Middle East and later on.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
That's my question.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
It wasn't like we were getting ready to go somewhere where there had been a scare or something.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It was just me and those guys.

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
So again, it's hard not to get, but it was us and there was a guy with a rifle

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
and we signed something like we did before.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
First time we signed the, took the anthrax vaccine,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
all of us signed something from what I remember.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
So after you take the booster, did anyone ever come up to you

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
and tell you do not talk about what you saw after the Warren officer as well speaking to you?

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Were you ever forced to sign anything regarding the incident or just...

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
Not about that. Nothing specific.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Implied, implied.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
It's a general feel that Marines will keep their mouth shut if told,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
which is generally true.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
Now, of course, if it was just Castle here, I wouldn't be surprised.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
But knowing two other Marines with similar stories, of course, I asked.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
And to my surprise, I learned that both Michael Herrera and Jonathan Weygant

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
stated they were subject to anthrax boosters immediately after encountering.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
In Weygant's case, a team of black operators and a crashed non-human UFO.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.000
And in Michael's case, a team of black operators and an enormous 300 foot diameter,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Perhaps it really is too conspiratorial to think what could have possibly been

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
the purpose of this anthrax booster, but it is a data point we simply cannot ignore.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
Following his exit from the Marine Corps, Castle attempted to push the encounter from his mind

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
while also dealing with the psychological trauma of being detained at gunpoint

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
by American operators on US soil.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
By 2002, Castle had an additional bizarre experience

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
that may possibly relate to UFO legacy program operations.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
Wackenhut, now called G4S Solutions,

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
is a prominent private security firm founded in 1954

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
that is synonymous with UFO legacy programs.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
I have spoken about Wackenhut previously as the trainers to Department of Energy Special Response Teams,

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
or SRTs, which may have comprised the operators that detained and interrogated

41:19.000 --> 41:25.000
Jonathan Weygant in the jungles of northern Peru in late March, early April, 1997.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
I have also discussed Wackenhut's infamous board member, CIA Deputy Director,

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
NSA Director, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
Director of National Intelligence, Director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, Bobby Ray Inman.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
I have discussed Inman in numerous projects, so I recommend checking out any of these videos.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
It's only become more significant now once I started doing some research

41:50.000 --> 41:58.000
and realizing possible sources of those type of mercenaries that do that work.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
And a combination of my Marine Brothers, Herrera, Weygant, hearing their stories and being like,

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
finally there was a triangle, enough information that I could start digging locations, contracts,

42:11.000 --> 42:19.000
government contracts back in the 90s in the term, not the term, the company Wackenhut kept coming up.

42:19.000 --> 42:27.000
And then I remember I was recruited, not a recruit, I received a letter of an event, a recruiting event by them.

42:27.000 --> 42:37.000
When I first got out of the reserves, the New York Army National Guard in 2002.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
And it was within three months of me getting out.

42:40.000 --> 42:49.000
At the time I figured I'm just on a list of veterans, however they got that, they were data mining and they got my email.

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt,

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
if nothing else it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset.

42:58.000 --> 43:05.000
Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters.

43:05.000 --> 43:15.000
They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1 Cobra's, Super Cobra's,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
which I knew enough about that I could work on them.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
But that's interesting because you were just training as a helicopter flight medic, that wasn't your MOS, your MOS was?

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
I'd left the ordnance behind at the New York Air National Guard at Syracuse.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
So they knew something about you, if they knew that you were actively training as a helicopter flight medic.

43:32.000 --> 43:41.000
In 2002, three years after he left service, Castle was approached out of the blue by Wackenhut to join their helicopter teams.

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
Wackenhut seemingly knew all about Castle's military service record in training as a helicopter flight medic.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
But why discuss this, and why is Wackenhut important to mention,

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
and what significance can we find in Wackenhut attempting to contract a Marine Corps Sergeant,

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
who seemed to observe clandestine UFO legacy program operations?

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
Well, aside from the possible involvement with the DOE NEST, or Nuclear Emergency Response Teams,

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
that brutalized Waygant and having Inman serve on their board of directors,

44:12.000 --> 44:21.000
Wackenhut is one of the most infamous and prolific private security agencies associated with UFO legacy program operations.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
Wackenhut has both been implicated with performing security for UFO legacy program sites,

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
or in Waygant's case, possibly involved with clandestine UFO crash retrieval operations.

44:32.000 --> 44:38.000
We mention Wackenhut only ever so briefly now, but please keep them in your mind for later for much more investigation,

44:38.000 --> 44:46.000
and the possibility that the team Castle observed was a Wackenhut trained and manned DOE SRT.

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security for many U.S. and DOE installations,

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
and these include the Nevada Test Site and ever-elusive Groom Lake Area 51.

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
Famously, Wackenhut worked perimeter security for Area 51 and caught Bob Lazar and his friends

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
who attempted to camp out on Bureau of Land Management Lands overlooking Dreamland

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
to observe test flights of the sports model UFO, quite an interesting little piece of UFO lore here.

45:18.000 --> 45:29.000
Now, let's finally analyze Castle's testimony in its entirety to transform a firsthand UFO encounter

45:29.000 --> 45:35.000
into what I propose is a unique glimpse into UFO legacy program operations.

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
Castle's sighting of the Triangle and its operational ground team occurred within the area of operations

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms.

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
During the 2nd to 14th March 1997, Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
while Castle was attached to a special-purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
Recall how I mentioned earlier that true insights into Castle's testimony

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
occur when we analyzed the Hunter Warrior experiment out of USMC 29 Palm Center.

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
Indeed, as I mentioned, I believe USMC's involvement in UFO legacy programs is slim to none

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
and as you will see shortly, our analysis will turn us away from the USMC completely.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
Let's now briefly touch on again the Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
Hunter Warrior sought to explore experimental methods to increase the area of influence

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
and combat effectiveness of Marine units by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
and new warfighting tactics and techniques.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
This experiment was conducted with three core objectives in mind,

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
tactical operations on the disperse non-contiguous battlefield,

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
C4I or command control communications computers and intelligence

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
to harness a single shared digital comms network over multiple battlefield areas

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
and enhancement of fire support and targeting improvements.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Indeed, according to a 1997 USMC news release titled

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
Findings Released on Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
Hunter Warrior could be neatly summarized as an experiment that, quote,

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
took a look at enhancing Marine units effectiveness

47:18.000 --> 47:25.000
by utilizing a combination of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques, end quote.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
It is the same news release we can even garner insights on Castle's

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
or as the USMC call it, SPM-A-G-T-F-X.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
We can learn that this special task force was involved not only in the three objectives of Hunter Warrior,

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
but additionally all three phases which included

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Phase 1, focus on reconnaissance surveillance, shaping and deception operations

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
by both Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
and the Operating Aggressor Force.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
Phase 2, study of targeting for initial engagements by air

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
and long-range indirect fire missions.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
And finally, Phase 3, major night movement by the Operating Forces,

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
additional targeting for the Task Force,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
and culmination with a mobile raid on opposing forces.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Recall how Castle's experience occurred

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
whilst performing overnight crash retrieval exercises for AV-8B Harrier jets.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
It is by considering this, I wager this incident occurred during the third phase of Hunter Warrior.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
And before we go any further, let's revisit a few details of Castle's encounter.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
Castle encountered a massive, exotic, human-made aerospace vehicle

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
that I will make the case was reverse engineered from non-human technology

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
alongside a heavily armed ground team equipped with tactical vehicles

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
resistant to the craft's electromagnetic effects.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
This clandestine team was operating in the area of operations of, at the time,

48:57.000 --> 49:03.000
the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
involving several ground and air combat units.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Clearly, the Triangle and its clandestine Special Mission Unit

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
did not choose the remote uninhabited area of Emerson Dry Lakebed

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
that was right smack in the middle of the Hunter Warrior experiment

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
to be seen by friendly American servicemen.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
The team chose an active warfighter experiment zone to operate in the shadows.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
Due to these factors, it is bordering on certainty

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
the Triangle and the clandestine team wish to operate on range

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
in the AO of the Hunter Warfighter experiment undetected.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
But what was their objective?

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
I theorize this team and its craft secret via USAP,

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
or Intelligence Community CAP, Controlled Access Program.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
Wish to attach themselves to Hunter Warrior to train and run practice ops

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
alongside blue, a.k.a. friendly assets

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
while maintaining secrecy hidden out of sight from blue soldiers, personnel,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
vehicles, comms, networks, etc.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
But let me explain.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
As I have already mentioned,

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
Castles' experience strikes similar chords to that of Herrera and Weigant.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
In Weigant's case in 2009,

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
the young Marines stumbled upon a clandestine team

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
with tactical vehicles actively loading containers,

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
possibly filled with humans under an enormous

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
octagonal alien reproduction vehicle in the jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
In Weigant's case in 1997,

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
just days or a few weeks after Castles' experience,

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
the young Marine was detained and interrogated by a clandestine team

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
in all black that seemingly sprung out of nowhere

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
in the Peruvian jungle after Weigant and other Marines

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
had arrived to the scene of a crashed non-human object.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
In all three scenarios,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
young Marines performing their duties were held at gunpoint

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
and threatened with death several times.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
In one case, Castles, the earliest of the three,

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
the clandestine all black team fled once their overwatch triangle

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
darted out of sight, and clearly some commanding officer

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
or person of authority contacted USMC commanding officers

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
to make sure the Marines who stumbled upon the secret operation by accident

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
would not discuss encountering the USAP or CAP technology.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
In the other two encounters,

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
the Marines were forcibly stripped of their gear, debriefed,

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
and forced to sign extensive non-disclosure agreements

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
under penalty of death by senior Air Force personnel.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
This series of events implies that after Castles' encounter,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
systems were put in place for how these black teams

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
would actually deal with blue or friendly assets

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
stumbling upon their missions,

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
while conducting operations parallel but out of sight to blue assets.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Although the triangle and team clearly failed

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
this hypothesized directive in Hunter Warrior

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
to operate in the shadows free from USMCIs,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
this theory also supports that clearly

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
methods were developed to deal with such blue encounters moving forward.

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
And indeed, I do have further statements to support this hypothesis.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Recently, Ross Colthart has come out to state

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
he believes with high conviction that thanks to his many sources

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
the infamous tic-tac encountered by Commander David Fraver

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
of the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego in 2004

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
was Lockheed Martin's gunkworks technology.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
Now regarding this controversial statement,

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
I have zero knowledge if the tic-tac was for sure human-made technology.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
I do, however, have my own framework that there are non-human tic-tacs

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and human-made copy tic-tacs,

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
but let's entertain Ross's theory here for a moment.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
If, and I mean if the tic-tac was indeed reverse engineer technology

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
out of the Lockheed skunkworks,

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
the flying propane tank like Kraft

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
operating in restrictive active US Navy airspace

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
that actually flew to the Navy aircraft cap point,

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
which cap is a combat air patrol designated reference point.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
Don't confuse this with controlled access program cap.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Clearly sought to operate and test on blue assets.

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
In this case, Commander David Fraver in the VFA-41 Black Aces.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
Now, some of the arguments I have seen for the tic-tac not being man-made

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
are claims that the Navy or any US entity would never test technologies

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
on their own pilots and servicemen.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
But this is incorrect and this is actually done commonly.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
So, if the tic-tac was flying within the AO

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
or area of operations of the USS Nimitz aviation exercises,

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
this would imply the tic-tac could have been gauging reaction types,

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
times, speeds, methods, etc. of an unknowing force

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
if any blue assets were to ever make unknown enemy contact.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
Warning the pilots beforehand taint the results and observations.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
But remember, all this around the Nimitz is just a hypothesis.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
But if true clearly ties into CASEL and demonstrates instances

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
in which human-made reverse engineered vehicles

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
operate within acknowledged war games or large-scale warfighter experiments

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
to both test on blue assets and operate in the shadows parallel to blue assets.

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
The Nimitz here also gives us a perfect segue into the Navy.

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
Why in the world would we discuss the Navy over USMC?

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
Well, this is because I believe with very strong conviction might I add.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
The triangular craft and team operated at the behest of the US Navy

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
with likely cooperation or assets sharing with the US Air Force.

54:49.000 --> 54:55.000
Let me explain here, and this will shockingly tie into much of my previous work.

54:55.000 --> 55:01.000
Returning to the 1997 USMC news release Detailing Findings on Hunter Warrior

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
we can see both the Marine Corps Combat Development Center

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
and the Center for Naval Analysis

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
release summary of experiment findings to the Deputy Commanding General of the MCCDC.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
The Center for Naval Analysis,

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
administrated by the CNA Corporation, is a Department of Defense

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
and Navy Federally-Funded Research and Development Center, or FFRDC

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
as we will call it from here on out.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
If you are a longtime viewer of my channel, this is definitely old news.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
But if you are a new viewer to my channel,

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
the foundation of my research points to FFRDCs

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
and how these semi-private government-controlled

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
research development tests and evaluation centers

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
act as liaison between the United States government

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
slash DOD and US defense contractors

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
for UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
alongside their university counterparts,

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
university-affiliated research centers, or UARCs.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
Such institutions, according to my work,

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
serve as subject matter experts

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
and provide necessary R&D work on project materials.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
This would in turn keep knowledge access

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
in technology of unknown origin programs quite strict,

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
only allowing contractor personnel with the need to know full insights

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
into the full extent of the non-human materials on which the programs focus.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs.

56:28.000 --> 56:33.000
UARCs here include the applied physics laboratories at John Hopkins

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
and the University of Washington,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
as well as the applied research laboratories

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
University of Texas at Austin,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
and Pennsylvania State University.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
Penn State's UARC was established in 1945

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
by future Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
Walker is a critical figure in the research of my channel.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board

57:00.000 --> 57:05.000
as participating in 1950s UFO crash retrieval

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
and reverse engineering programs alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
If you want to learn more about Walker and Bush,

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
go watch my recent Aztec video.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I especially recommend that video

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
because the Center for Naval Analysis

57:18.000 --> 57:24.000
can trace its founding to 1942's anti-summery warfare operations group

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
that was formed to assist the U.S. Navy with scientific advice

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
for finding and attacking U-boats.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Of course, in the Aztec video,

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
we devote over an hour to analyzing how and why.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
Scientists involved with anti-summery technology and warfare

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
working under Vannevar Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
served as primary sources to details and findings

57:49.000 --> 57:56.000
on the 25 March 1948 crashed 99.9 foot disc at Aztec, New Mexico.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
A connection I never in a million years

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
would have thought to make to castle in this video,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
but here we are.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
You will find nothing publicly

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
connecting the Center for Naval Analysis

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
to UFO legacy program operations.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
These connections only exist in the words of my sources to me,

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
so take that for what you will.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
But why in the world would a naval FFRDC

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
publish findings on Hunter Warrior?

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Was this for a good old-fashioned corporate reporting write-up,

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
or in my opinion,

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
a secondary report created by a tendril of the naval involvement

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
in UFO legacy program operations

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
that could easily backchannel USAP slash CAP data, reports,

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
and results of ARV applications alongside blue assets

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
back to the Navy while avoiding the marine chain of command?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Well, as it turns out,

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
the US Navy was integral to Hunter Warrior,

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
but not in a majorly acknowledged fashion.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
In 1995, Vice Admiral Robert Spain,

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
then Commander of Naval Air Force Pacific,

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
detailed the possibility of getting naval carrier tactical aviation

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
involved in supporting troops ashore in a December 95 report titled,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
quote,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
an operational examination of sea-based aerial fire support

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
for engaged troops, end quote.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
This proposed a new mission involving different training procedures

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
and employment concepts for aircrews

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
operating from aircraft carriers in close concert

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
with ground forces in a non-linear battlefield.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
At the behest of Admiral J. Johnson,

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
Chief of Naval Operations, in late 1996,

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
General Charles Krulak, Commander of the Marine Corps,

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
quote, requested that Commander Naval Strike Air Warfare Center,

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
Fallon, Nevada, assemble aircrews from Fallon

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
in Naval Air Station, LeMore, California

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
to explore the Hunter Air concept during Hunter Warrior,

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
which evaluated a wide variety of technologies

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and evolutionary tactics, end quote.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
The involvement of two naval facilities,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
now called the Naval Aviation Warfare Development Center, or NAWDC,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
as we will call it from here on out,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and the Naval Air Station, LeMore, California,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
or NASA LeMore, as we will start calling it,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
were an adjunct to Hunter Warrior,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
bolted on late in the planning state.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
According to my theory we're about to explore,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
NAWDC and NASA LeMore entered into Hunter Warrior

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
at the last second,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
realizing an opportunity to engage their ARV

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and special mission units in wargame exercise

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And of course, we have several avenues

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
to pursue to support this theory.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Top Gunner, what really is called

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Naval Strike Air Warfare Center,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
came here in 1996,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and the Naval Air Station has been here for us

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
a lot longer than that,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and it's a tenant command at the base

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
that does a lot of its training and learning

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
and its universities out there

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
when they prepare and train in the desert.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
In projects past, I have detailed at length

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
programs and efforts of the U.S. Navy

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
to retrieve, exploit, and store non-human vehicles.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I really recommend if you haven't seen that,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
stopping now and watching my video

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
on Navy UFO Legacy Program Operations

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and come back, which explores everything

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
from the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
to Admiral Bobby Ray Inman

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
to the Deep Submergence Systems Project

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
to a 1991 Deep Sea Triangle UFO Recovery.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But we will stick to Castle here

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and get to know NAWDC and Nassla Mour a little more.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
NAWDC is the Navy's center of excellence

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
for air combat training and development.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
NAWDC trains naval aviation

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
in advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
across assigned combat mission areas

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
at the individual unit integrated in joint levels,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
ensuring alignment of the training continuum

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
to set and enforce combat proficiency standards

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
to develop, validate, standardize, publish,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and revise tactics, techniques, and procedures."

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
NAWDC was set up in 1996

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
to consolidate the Naval Strike Warfare Center,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
the Navy Fighter Weapon School Top Gun,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
in the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapon School Top Dome.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
NAWDC provides service to aircrews, squadrons,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and airwings of the U.S. Navy

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
through flight training, academic instructional classes,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
and direct operational and intelligence support.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And remember that I said Navy Flight Training

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
in the Top Gun School here.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm sure none of you need reminding to Top Gun or Top Gun Maverick.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Attention on deck!

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Good morning.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Welcome to your special training detachment.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You see it.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Emmanuel Bates, NAWDC commander.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
You're all Top Gun graduates.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
The elite.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The best of the best.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
That was yesterday.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
has leveled the playing field.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Details are few, but you'll be able to see

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
details are few, but you can be sure

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
we no longer possess the technological advantage.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Success, now more than ever,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Half of you will make the cut.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
One of you will be named mission leader.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
The other half will remain in reserve.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Your instructor is a Top Gun graduate

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
with real-world experience in every mission aspect

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
you will be expected to master.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
His exploits are legendary.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
this program has ever produced.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
What he has to teach you may very well

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
mean the difference between life and death.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Call sign Maverick.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
This is the first time I've ever seen

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
an officer in the Navy.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
The Navy is the most successful

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
intelligence in the office of naval research

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
as spearheading numerous U.S. Navy

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
UFO legacy programs.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
NAWDC is also, quote,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
the primary authority on training and tactics

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
development.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
NAWDC provides training, assessment,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
aviation requirement recommendations,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
combat search and rescue, close air support,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
and associated planning support systems, end quote.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Funny enough, this naval facility

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
out of Fallon, Nevada also runs the FTRC

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
or the Fallon Range and Training Complex.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
An enormous training range just north

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
of the Nevada Test Site and Nevada Test

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and Training Range MRTFB,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
or Major Range and Test Facility Base,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
used extensively by Area 51 Groom Lake,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
a detachment of Edwards 412 Test Wing.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
A long time critical component of my work

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
has been discussion of air training ranges

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
for UFO legacy program operations.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Specifically, test and operational flight testing

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
of reproduction vehicles.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
This subject will come up again soon,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
critical in my opinion, to solving the who,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
what, and why of Castle's Encounter.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Now, I have discussed at length aerial training ranges

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
such as Dugway's Utah Test and Training Range,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Area 51 and Nellis' Nevada Test and Training Range,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and Edwards 412 Test Wing, Restricted Flight Airspace

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and directly accused each of these locations

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
of operating and testing alien reproduction vehicles

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
on these ranges.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Therefore, it is intriguing to me,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
NAWDC and Fallon, Nevada extremely close

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
to both the NTTR and UTTR

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
and added as adjunct to Hunter Warrior

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
employs its own enormous aerial training range complex.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And of course, NAWDC is no stranger to sightings of triangles.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
In 2002, a witness in Fallon, Nevada reported a quote

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
very large craft at 11.13 p.m.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
that he thought at first was a B-52.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It was a huge flying triangle with no running lights,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
but it did have some 7-9 dimly lit nodes.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It flew at 20 miles per hour making no noise.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It was astonishingly close and so large.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Total event time was 8 seconds.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The witness had a clear view of the side and bottom of the ship

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
but could not make out the leading edge or rear of the craft.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Welcome to Naval Air Station LaMoure,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
the Navy's newest, largest and only West Coast master jet face.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
NAS LaMoure is home port for every Navy strike fighter squadron

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
on the West Coast.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
These squadrons are equipped with F-A-18 Hornet

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
and Sufer Hornet aircraft.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The Air Station's new 9 million dollar air traffic control tower

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
is part of the Navy's largest and busiest air traffic control facility.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
NAS LaMoure is the Navy's newest and largest master jet base

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
located in Northern California.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
LaMoure is home to several carrier air wings

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
as well as the entire strike fighter wing Pacific.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And just as NAWDC,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
NAS LaMoure is no stranger to triangle sightings.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
These include the 2001 testimony

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
of Navy Aviation Maintenance Administrator Angelo Assetta

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
who stated he observed a triangular glowing object

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
with white glowing points above FRC West NAS LaMoure.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
After observing the craft travel slowly for three minutes,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
the vehicle departed at a seemingly instantaneous speed out of sight.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Assetta claimed to observe the same vehicle four times between February

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
to October 2012 with no response from the Naval Air Station.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
NAS LaMoure also shares some intriguing ties

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
with a usual tricky customer of this channel.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
An Air Force Base I suspect is intimately involved

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
in ARV testing and flight programs.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Edwards and their illustrious 412 test wing.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And just remember Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
claimed to observe man-made triangular craft called TR-3B

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
and don't worry we will explore this more shortly

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000
over Edwards Air Force Base less than 90 miles away from Castles Encounter.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
One night a longtime friend of mine

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and I were standing on top of the Fairchild A-10 hangar

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
at Edwards Air Force Base.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It was 2 a.m. and a perfectly clear night

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
with millions of stars visible to the naked eye.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
This was a very common night at Edwards.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I noticed a group of stars

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
who were looking at it seemed to be shifting in color

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and at the time I could name quite a few constellations.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I had just taken an astrology course

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and definitely knew what the Big Dipper was.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I made a C and I made a C in that course I think or B.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So I put it out to my friend that the three stars near the Big Dipper

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
in triangular formation were not supposed to be there.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
We watched as the strobing stars shifted in color

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
from a bright blue to a reddish yellow.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
After a period of about 20 minutes

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
we could tell that the objects weren't stars

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
because they were getting larger.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
This was somewhat unnerving.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It was further unnerving when the space in between the stars

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
started blocking out the stars in the background.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
We decided it probably was the top secret Air Force vehicle of some type.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Still we weren't sure.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
At the time I didn't believe in UFOs.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
That's the honest truth.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
The vehicle had gone from half the size of the Big Dipper

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
to twice its size in a half hour.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It had moved from the west to the east towards Edwards Air Force Base.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
About that time we could make out the silhouette or outline of the triangle.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The lights were possibly exhaust, flared brighter

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and vanished in an instant from the sky.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Of course, as the primary naval facility involved with Hunter Warrior

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I do believe a strong case can be built.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
The triangle castle observed hailed from Nautic,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
but I do for a little bit want to explore the concept

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
that the triangle could have come from Nassla-Mor, Edwards

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
or some sort of combination between the two.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Now, do you recall all the way back in this investigation

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
where I mentioned Castle's encounter occurred within the FAA airspace

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
designated as R-2501C?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Well, Nassla-Mor is one of few facilities that has access to the R-2508 complex,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
a section of restricted airspace and associated land

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
presently used and managed by three principal military activities

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
in the Upper Mojave Desert region.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
The R-2508 complex is compromised of internal restricted areas,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
military operations areas, air traffic control assigned airspace areas

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and other special use airspaces.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Use of these areas include bombing ranges, supersonic corridors,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
low-altitude high-speed maneuvers, radar intercept areas and refueling areas.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
The R-2508 sits near Antelope Valley,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
a location containing several aerospace facilities, RCS or radar cross-section ranges,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and proposed deep underground military bases I've directly accused

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
with UFO legacy program operations, largely Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
R-2508 is managed by the National Training Center for Irwin,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Naval Air Weapon Station, China Lake,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
and the 412th Test Wings Air Force Test Center out of Edwards Air Force Base.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
In fact, alongside Edwards, China Lake, and Palmdale Plant 42,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
which I have discussed extensively,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and Jeremy Corbell has recently listed street addresses

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
for calling for Congress to investigate UFO legacy sites with boots on the ground.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000
NASLAMOR now joins three other major entities I've connected to UFO legacy programs

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
with R-2508 Poncho 3 Clearance.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Poncho 3 Clearance allows only locally-based aircraft

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
in specific restricted sections of R-2508,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
and I bring up R-2508 not just because of Edwards

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and its proximity to CASEL's encounter,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
but because of R-2508 and its principal entities.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I have spoken at length previously regarding China Lake,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
UFO programs, and accused deep underground military bases.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
But Edwards, well, Edwards and its 412th Test Wing

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
are one of the cornerstone pieces of my work.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Recall Ed.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Ed is a very real, very vetted individual I consider a hostile witness.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
A witness who was summoned by SSCI or the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
and talked nonsense to avoid implication in illegal programs.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Ed spoke to Steven Greer, divulging many details regarding Edwards Air Force Base,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
and Ed has blocked me on every single platform from which I have contacted him.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Ed began his Air Force career at the Nevada Test and Training Range,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
specifically Nellis Air Force Base, while this NTTR was still called the 98th Range Wing.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
As an engineering requirements manager with a degree in electrical engineering,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Ed claimed he was briefed at Area 51-S4 by an Air Force major into UFO programs.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Ed was told numerous craft had been caught or captured,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and it was at Nellis Ed became aware of joint UFO programs with specifically Lockheed and Boeing.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
By the early 2000s, Ed was sent to Edwards for further range engineering work for Air Force

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
and DOD Premier Test and Evaluation Expertise for Aerospace Vehicles.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Ed managed the Air Force Flight Test Center, AFFTC, Experimental and Development Test and Evaluation Engineering Resources.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
This is where barriers are broken.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
This is where records are set.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
This is the edge of what we are capable of.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000
This is where we look into a new frontier and see the future.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
To fly faster, longer and safer.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
To make our warriors stronger and our enemies tremble.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
To push the boundaries of what we know is possible.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000
To deliver capabilities to the warfighter that will write history.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Our mission is test.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Our goal is to find the unknown.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
We learn all there is about our technology and we go further.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
We set the standard.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
We are innovators.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Ed was also sent to Edwards Range Orientation as a student in Edwards Infamous 412th Test Wing Air Force Test Pilot School.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:41.000
For multiple years at the Edwards 412th AFFTC, Ed served as Director of Operations for an electronics warfare group operating an acknowledged test infrastructure budget of $700 million.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Directly supervising 15 officers, civilians and enlisted personnel.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It was as director of an electronics warfare group, Ed claimed to act as the intermediary between scientists and AFFTC pilots of reverse engineered vehicles.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Vehicles reverse engineered from extraterrestrial technology, copycat vehicles sometimes manned requiring a pilot, sometimes not.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Ed's testimony has so much more to give as do clues to his testimony such as project red light.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
So please watch my video on him to explore further statements of biologics likely being stored at Wright Patterson Hangar 5.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Videos of essentially invisible inspection UFOs and Ed's follow-up career at the Pentagon Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel Chain.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Where he observed $34 and $40 billion in respective years go towards non-transfer of authority funds.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I vehemently believe Ed's testimony and due to such, Edwards 412th Test Wing is one of the most critical sites, wings and air spaces to uncovering UFO legacy program operations in my opinion.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But that's not all. Recall the infamous story of the TR-3B as relayed by Edgar Fouchet.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
It's exactly what the flying triangle is, the one that's been sighted around the world.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And it may be stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium or your city.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Fouchet would disclose his testimony from himself and his five close friends slash sources in 1998.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Many have criticized the Air Force Master Sergeant Fouchet for his lack of evidence.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But as I have said many times, I have found tremendous value in studying Fouchet's disclosures.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:43.000
According to Fouchet, TR-3B saw prototype flights begin in the early 1970s with successful implementation of gravity warping systems.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Fouchet would state three operational prototype systems were flying by 1994.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Triangles approximately 250 feet across, quite similar to castles 200 to 300 feet.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000
As well as an enormous 600 foot operational model.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Finally I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:13.000
A friend of mine said he'd never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:27.000
According to Fouchet, the engineering of TR-3B was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and TR-3B's program was managed by three of six of the US Big Six intelligence agencies, NRO, NSA and CIA.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Fouchet would claim the gravity warping propulsion systems were reverse engineered from non-human technology from Sandia National Labs and Lawrence Livermore Labs.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Two Department of Energy FFRDCs, and Sandia is of course, as I say, a usual tricky customer of this channel.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
The circular plasma field accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field Disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse engineered DMF-D and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you, nor am I.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
The government will go at any lengths.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury based.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:51.000
The MF-D generates a magnetic vortex field which disrupts and neutralizes effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:08.000
The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator such as the crew compartment, avionics, MF-D systems, fuels, environmental systems,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:20.000
This causes the effect of making the aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
except of course those we didn't build.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
TR-3B is an altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
For those that have seen it, that's how they do it.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:06.000
TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The multi-mode propulsion systems can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000
By Fouchet's definition, this makes TR-3B an alien reproduction vehicle.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
While the craft featured some systems we might associate with prosaia technology such as a triangular airframe,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.000
odd but still recognizable rotatable crew compartments, computers, radar, and ECM,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.000
or electronics communications measures and ECCM systems, the craft also featured propulsion systems

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
reverse engineered from non-human technology.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
This then of course draws our attention back to 1988's Fluxliner,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.000
that allegedly operated as a copycat saucer with non-human zero-point systems,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
but also featured disheveled F4 Phantom jump seats and sloppy paints as well as bolted panels.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:11.000
The ARV system for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities was indeed remarkably simple.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Of course, Castle saw only the underside and little of the side profile of the triangle

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
during this experience in the first half of March 1997.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
But I cannot help but draw strong parallels between the craft Castle observed and Fuchet's TR-3B.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Obvious parallels include the 200-foot models detailed by Fuchet resembling the 200-300-foot parameters outlined by Castle,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000
but also reference here Fuchet's detailed illustration of TR-3B.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
While working with a 3D artist to model Castle's craft,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.000
one of the points Castle was absolutely adamant about was that the lights on each vertex of the triangle

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
appeared like embedded spherical orb lights and not flush lighting panels.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Although not orb or spherical, we can observe non-flush lights on Fuchet's illustrations

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
that Fuchet described as hydrogen-oxygen-vectored rocket engines to aid in craft propulsion.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Additionally, Castle firmly stated each corner of the equilateral triangle was rounded,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and the same can be seen in TR-3B.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Although the craft was almost vantablack, meaning blacker than black with low reflectivity,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Castle observed what appeared to be a concave dome-like structure,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
unlit in the middle of the triangle.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:05.000
We can clearly see the Mercury Plasma Accelerator Ring MFD Gravity Reduction Device on TR-3B

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
sitting as a large circular feature on the underside of TR-3B.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:17.000
The strongest parallel to me, though, comes in the description of variable-vectored intake vents on TR-3B

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
observable from the top, bottom, and side profiles of the craft.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
While witnessing primarily the underbelly of the triangle,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Castle discussed what appeared to be several ridges or vents between each spherical light on each vertex of the triangle.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Could Castle's craft indeed have been the infamous alien reproduction vehicle TR-3B illustrated by Edgar Fouchet?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Well, believe it or not, there are even further data points bolstering this hypothesis.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But Fouchet's most drastic revelations of TR-3B comes from who he claimed piloted the vehicles.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Fouchet would state both military and contractors operated TR-3B,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
but military pilots were top of their class, elite pilots hailing from the Air Force and Navy test pilot schools

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
like Top Gun stationed at the NAWDC and AFFTC stationed at Edwards.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Could Edwards and NAWDC slash NASLAMOR slash naval programs at large

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
really have coordinated to operate reverse-engineered triangular craft

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and special mission units alongside blue assets in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
While as it turns out, there is even more circumstantial data to suggest so.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:47.000
The southernmost area of R2508 exists roughly 44.5 miles northwest of Emerson Dry Lakebed.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And recall Castle's testimony when the triangle departed at incomprehensible speeds.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:02.000
It traveled in a northwest direction back to the direction of R2508 airspace operated by NASLAMOR, China Lake, and Edwards.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Back to the direction of Antelope Valley, which for decades has produced myriad UFO triangle testimonies.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Back to the direction where Fouchet claimed the Navy and Air Force top pilots operated TR-3B.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And back to the direction in which Ed had years of first-hand experience with reverse-engineered vehicles.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
While I do believe TR-3B, or whatever you want to call a triangular ARV,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:39.000
R2508, Edwards, NAWDC, and NASLAMOR are cornerstone and critical pieces to this investigation and my prevailing theory.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I do want to explore an alternate origin point for the craft, still involving naval and Air Force UFO legacy program operations.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Edwards and its R2508 are nestled within Antelope Valley.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Antelope Valley has historically served as the nexus of U.S. aerospace technology.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Housing the infamous Air Force Plant 42, Lockheed's Gunkwerks, the former Norton Air Force Base,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:15.000
the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, and facilities Northrop Grumman, Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas operate as radar cross-section facilities.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.000
These three radar cross-section facilities, specifically Northrop Tahan and Lockheed Hellendale,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
are locations I have discussed extensively in prior work.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Antelope Valley in Palmdale, California has served as a cornerstone U.S. military-slash-private contractor-classified aircraft production and maintenance location.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:46.000
With Air Force Plant 42 alone producing many of the United States' most famous advanced aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk,

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:55.000
the B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk, SR-71 Blackbird, F-22, and F-35 Lightning,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:03.000
and as I stated earlier, Corbell recently listed street addresses for Plant 42 in relation to UFO legacy program operations.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:13.000
First and foremost is Senator Rounds should ask to see Lockheed's Plant B-6 complex in Burbank, California, 2300 Empire Avenue,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and then I would like to, you know, maybe he should go ask to see Northrop Grumman's Plant 42 in Palmdale, which is 3520 East Avenue M Street.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I mean, look, the addresses are there.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:33.000
While any of these aerospace locations mentioned above could have, and in my opinion do, engage in engineering, research development,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:43.000
test and evaluation, and construction of ARV in the Antelope Valley, I do want to center our attention to the radar cross-section facilities Tehan and Hellendale.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But what is an RCS facility?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000
To summarize, these locations utilize high-frequency radio waves to test aircraft radar signatures.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing radar cross-section.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:10.000
The radar cross-section sites utilize large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Many RCS facilities such as the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:27.000
This led the majority of the installations being built primarily underground to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies from Soviet spy satellites.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Numerous researchers over the years have accused the Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:56.000
The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrances for the Ant Hill Dome as well as actually been flown over these sites and personally observed the electromagnetic pulse weapons systems that are used to down craft.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:11.000
The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:25.000
So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It's just where the manmade UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.000
They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-grabbitic anti-grab.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.000
The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
They just go boom up, but they're placed over different diamonds.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these. We don't have time to go through.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I myself have covered extensively the legends of Tehan and rumors of an enormous underground installation connecting Tehan to Edwards, China Lake, and myriad UFO legacy program sites.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Go watch my video on Dumbs or Northrop to learn more there.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:32.000
We study Tehan in Hellendale because of the artwork of forensic artist Bill MacDonald in his 1992 piece Tohachapi Triangle.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
MacDonald met with four old engineers at the Denny's and Antelope Valley in the spring of 1992.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Two of the engineers hailed from Lockheed Hellendale RCS plants and two hailed from Northrop Tehan RCS plants.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Fed up with the security, quote unquote, impositions that affected their quality of life and the locations at which they were required to live out a significant portion of their lives.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000
The engineers dictated a craft they had designed and constructed called the XF-131 Supercentinal.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:15.000
As I have said before, MacDonald was then contacted by Chris Carter of the X-Files to include the very real XF-131 in Season 1, Episode 1 of the X-Files.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I have talked to MacDonald personally, attempting to contact these engineers, but MacDonald is unwilling to reveal their identities and I respect his decision.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Could, less likely in my opinion, instead of TR-3B, the triangular craft bin and XF-131 Supercentinal kept in the bowels of Tehan or Hellendale that saw regular test flights over R2508 with pilots from the AFFTC.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:59.000
That was called to action by NAWDC and NASLAMOR to conduct test operations in the Haunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, aiming to get ARV teams on ground, undetected in areas populated by blue forces.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I do, lastly, want to tie everything to Castle being contacted by Wackenhut in 2002.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:22.000
When the security contractor attempted to recruit Castle into their helicopter teams, Castle remarked to me how bizarre it was, Wackenhut seemingly knew everything about him.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:31.000
But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt, if nothing else, it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:49.000
They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1s, Cobra's, Super Cobra's.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And this leads me to a theory I'd like to propose.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:11.000
This theory says that the team Castle encountered in 1997 was not Air Force or Navy enlisted personnel, JSOC or Joint Special Operations Command or SOCOM Special Operations Command teams, but instead a private team from Wackenhut working with the Navy and Air Force.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:22.000
In this theory, in 2002, Wackenhut attempted to recruit Castle to these clandestine teams, possibly to a group like the infamous quote-unquote Blue Boys.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Alleged UFO crash retrieval rapid response teams operating from within US military bases employing helicopter units.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:42.000
As I stated earlier, Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security, for many US DoD and Department of Energy installations.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:50.000
And these included the Nevada test site, the Ever Elusive Groom Lake Area 51, and Los Alamos National Labs.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And additionally, Wackenhut allegedly served as a CIA front in the Cold War and beyond.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:07.000
A theory likely proven in the JFK files in a released March 1963 memo detailing the Wackenhut Corporation wishing to serve as cover for the CIA.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank excellent researcher Blocked Epistemology for this find.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:22.000
In the 1989 book The Terrorism Industry by Edward S. Herman, the board of Wackenhut and connections to US intelligence agencies was scrutinized.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Remember how in my SAIC video, I referred to SAIC by its nickname, NSA West, as so many US DoD and intelligence officials traded their stars and stripes in for business suits at SAIC.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:45.000
It seems that Wackenhut operated as a similar revolving door for accomplished military and intelligence professionals.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:55.000
In his book, Herman discussed how two figures I've associated with UFO legacy program operations in the past served on the board of Wackenhut in the 1980s.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And this is not to mention Bobby Ray Inman, a pillar stone of US intelligence, SAIC, and Wackenhut, I believe is one of the most key members to UFO programs in history.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:22.000
One such figure mentioned by Herman was Frank Carlucci, US Secretary of Defense, and an individual I wagered may have been alongside Brad Sorenson to the classified section of the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
where flux liner alien reproduction vehicles were observed.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Additionally on the Wackenhut board was William F. Raybourne, who also served on the board of SAIC and was also the director of the Polaris Summary Program in the US Navy.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Navy Chief Scientist of Special Projects, John Pena Craven, stated he was ordered to carry out the Deep Submergence Systems project to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform deep ocean engineering.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:03.000
To satisfy the whims of one project's sand dollar, a project that had cataloged every item of US national security interest resting on the sea floor tagged for retrieval.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:14.000
According to Craven, this program was nestled within another program, nestled within another, itself hidden within another program nestled under the Polaris Summary Program.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:24.000
To understand why I made the case sand dollar involved undersea UFO crash retrieval, go watch my US Navy Legacy Operations video.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:36.000
In my video on Jonathan Weigandt, I proposed a theory that the UFO crash retrieval team were Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy Special Response teams or SRTs.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:46.000
But overall wager, the crash retrieval team was more likely nearby US Army Green Berets recruited as special mission unit for USAT procedures.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:55.000
But let's talk a little bit about SRT. This anti-nuclear terrorism team is the DOE's own elite task force.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:12.000
An elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across the United States, the special response team has arrest on site authority and at least in the 1980s donned all black outfits and gear similar to the outfits described by CASEL.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Historically, in the late 90s, DOE SRT units also provided security for sensitive DOE defense nuclear facilities including Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000
These DOE SRT teams were trained by Wackenhut.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And not just trained by Wackenhut, but these elite, highly capable DOE SRTs were comprised of Wackenhut employees.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:49.000
According to the General Accounting Office, beginning in 1987, Wackenhut subcontracted Department of Energy Guard Services, not only A,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:56.000
controlled access to sites, conducting roving patrols of site perimeters and responded to physical security alarms,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.000
B, conducted property searches and inspections of facilities, personnel, and vehicles,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.000
and C, provided protection for classified and unclassified documents and other government property and facilities,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
but also that Wackenhut provided special response teams to act at the behest of the DOE.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:31.000
SRTs are really no joke. These individuals are the ultimate Department of Energy, INDUSEC, or industrial security team entrusted with transporting nuclear materials around the continental United States.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:44.000
One of the reasons I suspected Wackenhut DOE SRT was not involved in Wagan's case is because SRTs historically have acted within the continental United States, not abroad.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:53.000
After all, these Wackenhut trained and staffed teams do have arrest authority in quote-unquote recovery operations on U.S. soil.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:03.000
So, what if the Special Mission Unit, accompanying the Triangle during Hunter Warrior, was indeed a Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy SRT

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:13.000
that acted parallel to CASEL, who was busy and dutifully engaging in USMC AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval exercises?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:27.000
This clandestine SRT unit instead operated alongside Navy and Air Force ARV programs, engaged in UFO crash retrieval exercises within the continental United States.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:39.000
When investigating the case of Jonathan Waganth, I arrived to the conclusion based off of several lines of thinking the on-site scientific team securing the UFO crash site was DOE NEST,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:51.000
or DOE Nuclear Emergency Response Team. Part of my rationale here is the fact DOE NEST's governing authority is the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:06.000
The Schumer Rounds UFO legislation called the UAPDA references this 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement as a system leverage to improperly classify UFO materials, hardware, biologics, etc.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:18.000
as, quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear information, end quote. This same logic here for Waganth and DOE NEST applies to CASEL and DOE SRT.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:40.000
If SRT units, formally trained and staffed by Waganthut, are indeed conducting domestic UFO crash retrieval operations, just as with NEST, the DOE could likely leverage the same 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement to effectively black hole any UFO retrieval operations, recovered materials, etc.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I myself have personally heard rumors from sources of UFO crashes being transported across the continental United States, haphazardly labeled nuclear material and guarded by SRT.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:18.000
After all, if UFO materials are indeed obfuscated under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act as trans-classified foreign nuclear information, which I fully believe it does, does it not make perfect sense highly trained DOE SRTs entrusted with transporting U.S. nuclear materials and weapons would be the same operators to transport recovered craft?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:36.000
If this team observed by CASEL was indeed Waganthut, this wouldn't be the first time Waganthut suffered such a folly. Meet Richard Mingus, a federal services security guard at the Nevada Test Site from 1957 to 1953, who often times worked at Area 51.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:48.000
In 1982, Mingus was securing an underground nuclear test area at Area 6 on the Nevada Test Site while the base featured a live nuclear bomb exposed above ground.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:57.000
While lowering the bomb underground for explosives testing, the base at Area 6 quickly came under attack by armed combatants.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Mingus was primarily responsible for coordinating the breach of security up through the chain of command, all the way up to President Ronald Reagan as the event was a significant national security issue.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:18.000
It was later determined the men attacking were simply conducting a drill from where else but Waganthut.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:55.000
In late April, early March, if this was late April, I believe this was the last one or two days of April into early March, and this is the time that he actually reached out to David Grush and expressed his willingness and desire to both testify to and deliver his testimony to Congress.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Now, I'm recording this video, this outro, on August 2025, so I believe it was late July, there was an image floating around Twitter and so forth in UFO circles of Castle pictured with Stephen Greer, Eric Burleson, Michael Herrera, and others.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And this is because after he reached out to David Grush, he decided to also reach out to Stephen Greer, and of course Stephen Greer brought him to Representative Burleson and so forth.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Now, I had, like I said, I had known about Mr. Castle long before then, before that image, before that trip, I just had not made the introduction to him, reached out to him, I was still in the process of researching his history and vetting him.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
We talk about that a little more in our full interview, but let's start to break things down.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Now, distinct thing here, a lot of people are trying to delineate between the term whistleblower and witness, and I think we did that in this video.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Mr. Castle isn't necessarily a whistleblower, but he is indeed a witness, and as we demonstrate in this video, what he witnessed is not as simple as seeing a craft.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:09.000
You know, there are plenty of stories from USMC vets, Army vets, Air Force vets, Navy vets who have seen Tic Tac craft, who have seen craft close to the bow of their ships and so forth.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:19.000
What Mr. Castle saw was what eye wager is an alien reproduction vehicle, an accompanying black team, the same sort of team that both Wagant and Herrera saw.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
This team armed in all black featured US Army helmets featured.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You know, we try to tuck into the guns MP5 machine guns, not necessarily M16A4s or M4 carbines.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:39.000
The presence of an MP5 for all the gun fans out there would imply that this is possibly, you know, not a standard military unit as we saw.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:47.000
And one of the reasons why I led this was a PMC private military contractor SMU special mission unit out of Wackenhut.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.000
And this is critical. These times are critical because this occurred mere weeks before the case of Wagant.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And one of the arguments I made that I had a lot of fun doing in this video was discussing, hey, maybe the way this team handled Castle,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:11.000
maybe after they handled Castle because we know hit the black ops team just ran down the hill, drove back northwest to the direction of Edwards at the direction of R-2508.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Right after that, the team brutalized Wagant, detained him.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:24.000
So I believe there might have been different sorts of safeguards put in place if the teams encountered blue units.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And possibly this was exactly why the Navy tacked on to Hunter Warrior in the very end as an adjunct and put in some ARV teams.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Now, before we break things down, I know I put out a big thesis on there in my post video rant.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I never read from a script, but let me go ahead and reread the thesis from which I constructed most of my arguments.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
So we can have it all neatly recapped because I know we had an hour and 45 minutes.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000
So let's just go through that. I'll tell you when I'm starting and I'll tell you what I'm ending starting for my work in theory.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:07.000
March 2nd to roughly March 14th, 1997 saw the execution of Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiments that involved the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, 29 Palms, California.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
The experiment was designed to examine three specific areas.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:17.000
The Center for Naval Analysis published summaries of the findings alongside the Marines by 1 August 1997.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Having previously expressed interest in carrier tactical aviation involvement in supporting troops offshore in 1995,

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.000
a report titled An Operational Examination of Sea-Based Aerial Fire Support for Troops Engaged was written by the Navy.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000
After recommendation of, and I'm going to skip over this guys because I know I read a little bit in the video,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000
but of Navy Admiral J. Johnson to the Marine Corps Commanding General, the Navy Nautic,

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
or what was previously known as the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:55.000
assembled air crews alongside the Naval Air Station in the Moore, California to explore Hunter Air concepts during Hunter Warrior,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
which on the surface evaluated a wide variety of technologies and evolutionary tactics.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Involved naval experiments here, as we discussed, were considered adjunct, bolted on late in the planning stage.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Tying into Castle's encounter of the enormous floating triangle, an armed ground team,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Nautic and Nass, the Moore, engaged a Black Ops crash retrieval, or tactical team,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:26.000
or special mission unit, SMU, in war game exercises to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc.,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
alongside blue assets without detection, and obviously, due to Castle's encounter,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000
this directive failed and failed miserably.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Rational here can be extended to and pause. I know this is controversial,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
but I did want to explore it because it is pretty intriguing to me,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.000
and I'd like to do a little more poking around because as I stated, I have heard that there are human tic-tacs

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
and non-human tic-tacs, and I tend to agree with that sentiment.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I'm not staking my position or opinion in anywhere in the sand regarding Nimitz,

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
but I thought this was interesting to explore, anyways, back to the thesis.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Rational can be extended to the 2004 Nimitz tic-tac encounter.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
If the tic-tac was indeed reverse-engineered technology from the Lockheed Skunk Works,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000
operating in restricted, active US Navy airspace, this draws parallels to Castle's experience.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
As the tic-tac would have been conducting test missions, flights, etc. among blue assets,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
possibly to gauge blue responses to such vehicles or approaching cap points without detection

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
or as little detection as possible.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Possible reason for this tic-tac testing on blue assets is to see reaction types,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000
time, speeds, methods of an unknowing force if there was enemy contact.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Warning the pilots beforehand taints the results.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Quick pause, I'm not advocating for anything or making claims, I'm just exploring this concept.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000
The Navy or other US entities would never test on their own pilots or servicemen,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
some people claim, well, this is wrong, it's done every day.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Further parallels to Castle involve the late March, early April experience

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
of Lance Corporal Jonathan Waganth in the jungles of Peru.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
By Castle's description, there is a hypothesis that could be made.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Castle encountered the same type of team Waganth encountered training,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
working alongside blue assets without detection.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Of course, in both cases, such training failed.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Then this raises further questions.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.000
In Waganth's testimony, if the DOE Ness team he encountered that arrived via CH-47s

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:37.000
was the team alongside the DOE Ness team, actually DOE SRT Wackenhut,

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000
and I do want to pause here, and you know what, let's just throw away the script, guys.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:47.000
This is the time we don't read from the script, so I do want to dive into Nautic and Nasslemore a little more.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
But, you know, when I was reading the terrorism industry book,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000
and to learn more a little bit about the board of Wackenhut and some, you know,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.000
various chairman that they had, including Bobby Ray Inman, including Frank Harlucci,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
including Admiral William F. Raybourne,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I also saw in that book that in the late 80s, early 90s,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.000
that Wackenhut had established fobs or forward operating bases

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
or places of business in specifically Peru.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.000
So now I really want to re-engage the idea that possibly DOE SRTs

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
were the team that Waganth encountered as well.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:30.000
This SRTs are, I don't have any evidence or sources to back this up,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000
but I am confident in that, in this hypothesis,

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
that the DOE SRT privately trained and staffed by Wackenhut

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
is what Castle encountered and now possibly Waganth.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And what strengthens this theory is the argument I made,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000
such as DOE Nest and such as so much in DOE and NNSA,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
that the SRT team could fall back on the 1954 atomic energy agreement

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.000
to basically obfuscate any mission, any retrieval,

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
any operation they're doing, and this can be misclassified

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
as transclassified for in nuclear materials.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
So there is no need to divulge any information to any entity

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
that does not have a strict need to know

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
or is not on the bigot list of the associated CAP USAP

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
or WAVED USAP.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Now, Nautic and Nassel Amour isn't that interesting.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I was so thrilled to build a thesis around this

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
and being able to see that Nautic and Nassel Amour

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000
have their own sorts of triangle sightings.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
That was pretty intriguing to me.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And then the tie-ins to Edwards.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Now, where were these craft stationed?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
There is an argument to be made that Nassel Amour held the craft,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
that Nautic held the craft, that Edwards held the craft,

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
but I do think it is quite plausible.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And in my opinion, likely that this program operated

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
between Navy and Air Force out of these three locations

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and possibly China Lake.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Fallon, Nevada is interesting as this is quite close to Area 51

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
and the Fallon Test Range is quite close to the Nevada Test Range.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Anybody who's watched my videos and Jesse Michaels as well,

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
hey, I'm rep at his merch.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
We'll know the story of Randy Anderson who claimed

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
while doing test stops out at Area 51 Auxiliary sites

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
on land owned by the Department of Energy,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
he himself has come across electric-ovidic triangle craft

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
that the US hasn't stored.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Now, also near Fallon, Nevada,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Nautic is a Newark Keyport location

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
that is supposedly a depot for underground mine storage.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Now, if you watched my, I think it was SAIC or US Navy video,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I talked about Newark Keyport as being almost a data acquisition type entity

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
within US Navy legacy program operation.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
So that is something to chase down as well.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000
As far as pilots here, we know that the triangle craft,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
if we're relegating this to TR3B,

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
that according to Fouche that the pilots come out of the AFFTC,

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
and the Air Force Test Pilot School out of Edwards,

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000
and we know from Ed, or at least I know from Ed,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
that this is indeed a place where I believe

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:07.000
with extremely high certainty that elements of the 412th Test Wing

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000
and Edwards and likely various Air Force MRTFBs

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
including the Utah Test and Training Range,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Nevada Test and Training Range collaborate to test flight ARV.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Now, I know what Fouche said,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000
that these were test pilots from the Navy and Air Force

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000
and I know, guys, I know Nautic Top Gun is not a test pilot school,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
this is an active fighter school.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
The Navy's test pilot school is actually out at PAX River,

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
which is interesting as well, that's another interesting connection.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But quite intriguing that Castle's testimony,

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
especially with a craft going Northwest

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
and the team going Northwest into R-2508 airspace,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
ties into Edwards and Edwards Restricted Ranges

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
when we also know that Nautic and National Moor had involvement as well.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
So, the reason I think this craft is an alien reproduction vehicle

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
is because of the team associated that Castle encountered

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and because of just some of the characteristics of the craft.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I know that Kuzlowski and Phillips out of Arrow

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000
have begun recently talking about triangular craft

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
and these being advanced human platforms and I do agree with that

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
and I am still of the mind that some of these triangular craft

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
are alien reproduction vehicles in the sense that

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Fouche is right that their propulsion systems are based off of non-human technology

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
or perhaps other aspects of their propulsion, their survivability,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
their mass reduction, their internal mass reduction,

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
various aspects have been leveraged from non-human sources.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I think it is intriguing and I think that from Castle's description

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
it sounds like what he saw was TR-3B.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Guys, I hope you appreciate those renders we have in this video.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I think they are wicked cool.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
But remember, Castle only saw the underside of the craft in part of the side

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
so he did not see the top of the craft so we left the top blank.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
No features there, not like the TR-3B with the raised crew compartment in the middle

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
because we do not know what was up there.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
What is interesting and what kind of takes me back to TR-3B

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
is the concave section in the middle

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
and if you actually look at Sal Paese's patents

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
out of, not associated with, but out of Pax River,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I think this was in 2017 for inertial mass reduction craft,

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
you'll see a triangle with a large concave center as well,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
interesting tie-in and of course Castle talks about the ridges

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
in between the lights of the triangle

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
and that reminds me closely of TR-3B as well.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
One of the things we have to pay attention to what Castle said

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
is the lights on each vertex weren't just flush lights or recess lights,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
these almost seemed like orbs embedded in the triangle

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
and these gave off a whitish, yellowish, goldish color

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
but did not cast light in the surrounding area.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
There's so much to chew through here guys,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.000
so much awesome stuff that relates to so much of what I've talked about

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
on my channel and so much in UFO lore.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
So, I will be releasing the Castle interview soon,

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
we talk a lot more, we talk about the anthrax vaccine,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
we talk about the other marines specifically

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
because I know what you're thinking,

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
there are multiple other marines with Castle

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
and also behind the scenes we're trying to track down these marines

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
to talk to them as well.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
You know, part of the issue with cases like Wageance

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
and Michael Herreras is we can't necessarily pin down

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000
exactly where this event happened, you know, in Sumatra, Indonesia

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
or in Wageance case, even if it was northern, southern Peru,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
if it relates to Bukalpa, where,

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
but what is interesting here with Castle

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
is we do know that within just a couple mile radius

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.000
of Emerson Dry Lakebed, this is where this encounter happened

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000
and we know the exact direction in which the craft

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
and the team departed.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
So, there's a lot more to true through

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and a lot of interesting things to follow up on.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Again, that interview will come out soon.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.000
I actually went out to where Mr. Castle lives,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
spent a couple days with him and we were courted out there.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
So, wonderful things to say about the man,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
he's been all but gracious.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Same with other witnesses I've talked to,

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
before we started talking, he was incredibly nervous,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
incredibly nervous.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
But we spent some time together, he started to open up

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
and the man was a joy to talk to

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
and I hope to get him back in front of some congressmen.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I'd like to be there with him maybe

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
and maybe we can present his testimony and this thesis together

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
to maybe Rep Burleson or someone similar,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
but that is what I would like to do next.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Some bookkeeping stuff, guys.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
There's been a lot of buzz about the Danny Jones

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
and Chris Ramsey podcasts.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Those have had an insane amount of views

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
and it's a true honor that each of you guys

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
watch that and support this channel.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
There's so many new viewers to this channel,

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I think we've got almost 20,000 from those two interviews.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
So, if you're new to this channel, I love you.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
If you are a longtime viewer of this channel,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
I also love you.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
In the comments all the time, I see so many people

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
that have been with me leaving comments since day one,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
since I had 20 subscribers, 30 subscribers,

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
names that come to mind.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Mighty Mo, Tanner Johnson, Birdie606.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
So, a lot of you guys I recognize

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and I appreciate each and every one of you.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Remember, I do have a Patreon.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I would love if you support the channel.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
That's how I fund these trips.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That's how I fund the 3D designers

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
and that's how I keep my channel going.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I don't gatekeep content,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
so please just support what you think the channel is worth.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Your support means the absolute world to me

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
and if you don't want to support on Patreon,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
at least give this video a like, a comment,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
and subscribe to the channel.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I think every YouTuber says this,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
but it actually does help quite a bit.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
But I appreciate everybody being here

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
and if you watch the end here, thank you so much.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
I got some exciting stuff coming down the corners.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
We got some hearings coming up in September.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I think we have a date for that.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
I will be there for that

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
and I know I haven't done it in a long time,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
but I think I will do a live stream before

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
and after the hearings

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
and I will be there for a lot of fun.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I will be boots on the ground for that.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Remember, I got a Patreon support the channel.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Like and subscribe.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I will catch everybody on the next episode.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I'm trying to think if there is anything else I missed.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Yes, there is.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Randy Anderson talked about Area 51

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
and seeing triangles there.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I also have my friend, the Army Public Affairs Officer,

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
who was at Area 51 at Groom Lake

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
who on the cleared flight line

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
when he was with some active colonels there,

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
saw a triangle take off vertically

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
at incomprehensible speeds,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
making no sounds, not disturbing any of the dust around it.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
I think I talked about that on Danny Jones,

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
but I just remember that now.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
We will wrap that up today.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I think we are approaching on two hours.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
With that being said, guys,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
thank you everybody for joining me

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
and thank you for supporting Mr. Castle.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
I will link his Twitter down below.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
He is a great guy.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Feel free to talk to him.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I appreciate his courage coming out

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
and thank you so much for watching.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Catch everybody next time. Bye.
