1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty, you know, on 12-hour shifts.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7pm to 7am.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
probably in chairs or hanging out in the back.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We get a call on the radio that there's, you know, either unexplained

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or unauthorized something about flare activity in the desert.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You know, maybe four, three to four miles out, maybe five.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We come over a hill, we're yanking the trailer behind us, you know,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We come over a hill and all five of us see it.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And possibly some kind of venting on the sides,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That was there hanging in the sky.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I say hanging because there was enough wind for something even, you know,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I know aerodynamics, something that if it was thin enough,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
maybe it could hover slightly.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this is what it would look like if you were looking straight up at it.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Of course, that's not the angle, it was more, you know,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't want to use that.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A soup bowl going forward with no light emitting from here,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
yellow, yellowish, whiteish,

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
or kind of like a ball sphere had been embedded into the underside.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Accompanying it, we're about 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and five to six can't remember exactly vehicles.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Look like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks jacked up all black, all matte,

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
some with canopies, some with antennas.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is all coming in a flash, right?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The minute we came up over about half of them,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
maybe 15 came running up the hill towards us,

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
V-formations with guns.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, right up harsh language.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Get your f***ing heads down, get your f***ing heads down.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Get your f***ing heads down.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, not shooting.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But looking like they're ready to.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know, very close to our heads as if they didn't want us to look at anything.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We felt, my initial reaction was we f***ed up,

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
found something that we shouldn't be involved in

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and I'm just going to comply because I'm scared.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On this channel, I investigate UFO whistleblowers,

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
UFO crash retrieval cases,

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and UFO legacy program operations that exist somewhere between elements

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
of the United States Department of Defense,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
intelligence communities, colossal defense contractors,

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and semi-private R&D experts called

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Federally-funded research and development centers.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
One of my personal favorite topics to study

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
is the concept of alien reproduction vehicles.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Human-made aerospace vehicles that range from replicas of non-human craft

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to prosaic airframes and designs

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
employing one or more aspects of non-human technologies.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The term ARV was coined by the now infamous Brad S,

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
an industrial designer who witnessed three man-made flying saucer vehicles

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
called quote-unquote flux liners at a classified section of the 1988

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Norton Air Force Base Air Show,

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
which were described as copycat vehicles

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
employing highly exotic propulsion systems and craft designs,

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
while still featuring F-4 Phantom jump seats and sloped-on paint.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
As recently as 2024,

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
whistleblower Matthew Brown proposed the Immaculate Constellation Reports,

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
which detailed a special access program

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
targeted with performing data acquisition of video,

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
satellite imagery, etc.,

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
on UFOs and quote-unquote reproduction vehicles.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Such cases involved reproduction vehicles

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
detailed as silent, enormous black triangles

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
observed by U.S. Indo-Paccom, or U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have discussed numerous cases surrounding alien reproduction vehicles,

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
including the ever-complex and awe-inspiring flux liner,

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the whistleblower testimony of Ed,

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who served as an electronics warfare detector

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
at the Edwards 412 test wing,

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
where he claimed he served as the mediary between scientists

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and test pilots of reverse-engineered UFO craft.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I have devoted an entire documentary

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to exploring man-made reproduction vehicle triangular craft.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In this project in question,

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I argued why I believe many, perhaps not all,

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but many triangular UFO sightings are in fact man-made vehicles

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that harness exotic technologies and concepts.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Specific craft covered were seemingly prototype iterations of triangles

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
with varying features seen worldwide from the 1970s to 1990s.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Crescendoing in the 1989 Belgian Triangle UFO wave,

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
as well as the XF-131 Super Sentinel,

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
which famously made its way onto the X-Files Season 1, Episode 1.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now,

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map,

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs?

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No. Planes built using UFO technology.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After forensic artist Bill McDonald drew the copycat vehicle

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in a Denny's in Antelope Valley in 1992.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Based upon the first-hand testimony from four engineers,

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
two from Lockheed out of the Hellendale radar cross-section plans

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and two from Northrop Grumman out of the Tejon radar cross-section plans.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The most famous mention of reverse-engineered craft came from Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet,

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
who detailed the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The pride of U.S. Aerospace, whose propulsion system was reverse-engineered by Sandia

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in Lawrence Livermore National Labs.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Two federally funded research and development centers,

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
whose pilots hailed from the U.S. Navy and Edwards 412 Test Wing,

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
whose engineering was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne Ryan,

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and whose program was managed by three of six of the U.S. Big Six intelligence agencies,

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the NRO, NSA, and CIA.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But today, I am thrilled to announce I have sat down with a first-hand UFO witness

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
who since he first approached David Grush in early 2025

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is dead set on swearing his testimony before Congress.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A former U.S. Marine whose testimony ties into this entire long-winded intro

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
as well as other whistleblower testimonies I have covered,

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
specifically Ed from the Edwards 412 Test Wing and U.S. Marines Jonathan Waganth and Michael Herrera.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Meet Roderick Castle III, a veteran and sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 to 1999,

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
who now works with veterans suffering from PTSD.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Castle served with the VMA-513, the Flying Nightmares,

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
an AV-8B Harrier Squadron stationed out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona,

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
leading a team of six to eight Marines in aviation ordinance while also training as a helicopter flight medic.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I have recorded an entire interview with Castle detailing his harrowing experience

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
of what I wager is a triangular ARV, an accompanying black operation's unacknowledged Special Mission Unit

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
encountered a little too close for comfort here in the continental United States.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Viewers of my channel know me and know who I am,

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so a week before the interview with Castle releases,

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we will today exhaustively explore his testimony

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
in place the who, what, when, where, and why to his harrowing encounter.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
To some, Castle's testimony may seem simple and quite similar to that of Waganth and Herrera.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
While on duty, a Marine encounters an all-black team with advanced gear and weaponry,

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
featuring no insignia or identification,

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
there might be a craft-defying all-logic hovering motionless nearby seemingly operated by humans,

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but the Marine is forcibly detained, threatened, and met with reprisals.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But to me, Castle's brief but powerful testimony offers us an unparalleled look into U.S. legacy program operations,

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
how these UFO paramilitary groups operate alongside other blue, a.k.a. friendly assets,

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and a greater understanding that the U.S. does indeed employ triangular craft

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that can defy all logic for clandestine aerospace applications.

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So please look at this video as a part one of two,

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the investigation of Castle should not be viewed without the interview of Castle.

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
With all that out of the way, let's dive in, but last thing here,

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know some viewers of my work can get tripped up with so many uses of acronyms.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So guys, today we are diving into military programs,

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
so please expect a tremendous amount of acronyms.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I will try to relist all acronyms used in the video description,

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so please reference there if you get tripped up,

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but with that out of the way, let's begin.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Roderick John Castle III entered into service at the United States Marine Corps in 1994,

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and by his retirement, Castle earned the rank of Sergeant, or an E-5.

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Castle's primary MOS, or Military Occupational Specialty, was a 6531.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Her aircraft ordinance technician, Castle served at the MAG-13,

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
or Marine Aircraft Control Group 13,

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
of the 3D MAW, or Third Marine Aircraft Wing,

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
stationed at MCAS Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma,

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and yes, I know, we're already getting into the acronyms.

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Now real fast, I previously discussed Yuma Proving Ground,

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
or US Army MRTFB, or Major Range and Test Facility Base

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
in regards to UFO Legacy Program Operations.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
23 US MRTFBs exist,

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
8 Army, 6 Navy, 7 Air Force, and 2 Defense Agency.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
These include Edwards 412 Test Wing,

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
NAWC Patuxent River,

161
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Command,

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Fort Wachuka, and the West Desert Test Center, and more.

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
One of my prevailing and prominent theories regarding UFO Legacy Programs

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
is the usage of these critical core MRTFBs

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
for UFO research, development, tests, and evaluation.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This includes everything from craft storage,

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
accompanying deep underground military bases beneath MRTFBs,

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and utilization of restricted airspace for test flight

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
of recovered or reverse engineered craft.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
MCAS, out of which CASEL operated, is not part of Yuma Proving Ground,

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
therefore it is not part of the MRTFB.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In fact, while CASEL's experience involved a coordinated US Marine Corps experiment,

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wager the USMC is quite unlikely to run and operate

174
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
UFO Legacy Program Operations,

175
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and keep this in mind as we progress in our investigation.

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
While I can present ample testimony, evidence, files, and research

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that the US Army, Air Force, and Navy

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
operate siloed UFO Legacy Programs in conjunction with the US Big Six Intelligence Agencies,

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can find no such evidence even suggesting USMC engages with the UFO portfolio.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
CASEL served with the VMA-513, nicknamed the Flying Nightmares,

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
a USMC attack squadron known for use of its AV-8B Harrier jets.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And towards the tail end of its service trained as a helicopter flight medic.

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Harriers are fascinating pieces of technology.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
These intriguing craft are known as VTOL, Vertical Takeoff and Landing Jets,

185
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
while the AV-8B Harriers are known as STOVL, Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing,

186
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
meaning that Harriers require little to no runway to take off and can actually land vertically.

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And this means Harrier jets can stand still and hover in the air,

188
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
thanks to their Rolls-Royce Pegasus engines equipped with four rotating nozzles

189
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that can direct engine thrust quite the sight for an attack jet.

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I mention this due to CASEL's familiarity with both Harrier jets and helicopters.

191
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He was well accustomed to VTOL and STOVL technology, helicopter morphology,

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and Harrier standstill flight vectoring and dynamics.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In 1997, CASEL would take part in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
a 12-day experiment that ran from the 2nd of May 1997 to 14 May 1997

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
in Southern California out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment was at the time

197
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory,

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
which explored methods to increase the area of influence and combat effectiveness of Marine units

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The Hunter Warrior Experiment operated with three primary objectives.

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
One, quote,

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The first objective area covers tactical operations on the dispersed, non-contiguous battlefield.

203
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How small units perform against a numerically superior force on a battlefield that has no front, flank, or rear areas,

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and is key component of this objective, end quote.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Two, quote,

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The second area is command control communication computers and intelligence, and the single battle concept.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Creating and using a shared digital communications network will be crucial in many different areas.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Experiments in C4I examine the digital network in information sharing, end quote.

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And finally, three, quote,

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The third objective is enhancing fire support and improving targeting

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to dominate the broad dispersed battlefield of the future,

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
effective and efficient use of all indirect fire is absolutely necessary, end quote.

213
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
During Hunter Warrior's Advanced Warfighting Experiment's operations,

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and within Hunter Warrior's AO, or area of operations, is where CASEL's experience took place.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now, if you recall in 2023, Jeremy Corbell released a video of a supposed triangle UFO over 29 palms.

216
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Arguments persist to this day if the video depicts a craft or a group of flares,

217
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
but that and 29 palms are not relevant to our investigation today.

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Indeed, I believe many studying CASEL's testimony would look for evidence of UFO Legacy Program operations

219
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
out of 29 palms Marine Station, but I vehemently disagree.

220
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I believe that by studying the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
we can truly gain unparalleled insights into UFO Legacy Program's conduct,

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
testing, and training missions on U.S. soil.

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hang tight because after we detail CASEL's encounter,

224
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
we will spend a significant amount of time exploring the 1997 Hunter Warrior Experiment.

225
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty on 12-hour shifts.

226
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.

227
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee,

228
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
probably in chairs or hanging out in the back.

229
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We get a call on the radio that there's either unexplained or unauthorized

230
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
something about flare activity in the desert.

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Maybe 3 to 4 miles out, maybe 5.

232
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is the part that gets a little sketchy, but I've tried to find it on maps.

233
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We come over a hill or yank in the trailer behind us,

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour.

235
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We come over a hill and all five of us see it.

236
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle,

237
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner.

238
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And possibly some kind of venting on the sides,

239
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy.

240
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That was there hanging in the sky.

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So accompanying it were about 30, 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms.

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And 5 to 6 can't remember exactly vehicles.

243
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It looked like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks, jacked up, all black, all matte.

244
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Some with canopies, some with antennas.

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is all coming in a flash, right?

246
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill.

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Enough to notice that the thing was hanging there.

248
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Enough to notice it was slightly turning counterclockwise.

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Perhaps there was some indentation in the center,

250
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
maybe some type of striation or venting on the side,

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but these are impressions that I've had to find

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and integrate with that initial shock and awe of seeing something like this.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
During the 2nd of March 1997 to the 14th of March 1997,

254
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Roderick Castle with his team of 5 to 6 other Marines

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and the VMA 513 flying nightmares

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
engaged in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting experiment

257
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms,

258
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
located in the Southern California desert.

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Castle and his fellow team operated attached

260
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
to an experimental Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.

261
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ironically to this channel,

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Castle and his fellow Marines participated in the experiment

263
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
as a Harrier jet crash retrieval team.

264
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
One night during the 12 day operation,

265
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Castle and his team were engaged

266
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in overnight crash retrieval duties for Harriers.

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The Marines were sent in to investigate

268
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
unidentified flare activity.

269
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
As you will see in our interview,

270
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Castle and I have worked hard to trace almost exactly

271
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
where this incident took place to reduce as much ambiguity

272
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and questions as possible.

273
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Our incident occurred within a 7.5 mile radius

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
of Emerson Dry Lakebed,

275
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
northwest of 29 Palms

276
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
in about 90 miles southeast of Edwards Air Force Base

277
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
in the Antelope Valley.

278
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If you know my work,

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
my bet you can already guess

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
where we will be going in our investigation.

281
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Castle and his Marines came over a hill

282
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
heading northwest in this area

283
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and we can find multiple dirt roads

284
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
with varying terrain near the Emerson Dry Lakebed.

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
According to the Federal Aviation Administration's

286
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
special use of airspace,

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
this event occurred within R2501C.

288
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I strongly recommend committing this piece of airspace to memory

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
as regular old boring discussion

290
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
of air traffic organizational policy

291
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and restricted pieces of airspace

292
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
will become paramount to our investigation.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So this is what it would look like

294
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if you were looking straight up at it.

295
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Of course, that's not the angle.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If it's more, you know,

297
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I want to use that.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So you only saw the underside of this, right?

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

300
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You cannot speak to what the top would like.

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to do this faintly

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
because there's perhaps convex, right?

303
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Going inward.

304
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is that what I said before?

305
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Or concave.

306
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Concave, yes.

307
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Same.

308
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
A soup bowl going forward,

309
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but no light emitting from here,

310
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
but a yellow,

311
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
a yellowish, whiteish

312
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
or kind of light.

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You know, nothing crazy, like psychedelic or

314
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
but definitely like a ball,

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
a sphere had been embedded into the underside.

316
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And that's important you say that, right?

317
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's not just like a flush LED light.

318
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not like spheres embedded into each corner.

319
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, and the light was

320
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
deeper than an incandescent or an LED.

321
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
One of the things you told me when we were talking

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and this, the light cast,

323
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
didn't cast onto the ground

324
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
or the team or anything.

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The light wasn't cast.

326
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You know, not completely non-reflective,

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
which it would be, you know,

328
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
invisible basically, but

329
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
all this aspect, very black,

330
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
blocking out the sky and the stars.

331
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You get that deep dark blue

332
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in the desert sometimes.

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The moon was not,

334
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't know where the moon was that night.

335
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It must have been over one of the hills.

336
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Coming over the hill in a Humvee,

337
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
carrying fire suppression equipment,

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the Marines encountered an enormous,

339
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
equilateral triangular craft

340
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that measured approximately 300 feet in length,

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
hovering silently 150 to 200 feet in the air.

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The craft emitted no detectable sound,

343
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
featured no exhaust ports,

344
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
bolts, seams, or rivets.

345
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
An unlike a Harrier or helicopter

346
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
sat stationless in the air,

347
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
no wobbling, bobbling, or weaving,

348
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and featured no exhaust signs

349
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
like one would see from a Harrier's

350
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
VTOL thrust engines.

351
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The ominous vehicle was matte black or darker

352
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
with no observable reflectivity

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and featured three lights at each corner,

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
bright lights, but not blinding.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The lights were a combination of yellow,

356
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
white, and gold,

357
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but oddly cast no shadow onto the ground.

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Below the craft,

359
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
an estimated 150 to 200 feet away from the castle

360
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
were unmarked black tactical vehicles

361
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and an accompanying unit

362
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
of approximately 30 armed men

363
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
in unmarked black uniforms.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Like the stories of Wagan and Herrera,

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
these men bore no insignia,

366
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
identifiable markings, flags, or name tags,

367
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and the operators all spoke with American dialects.

368
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The vehicles seemed to be all Ford F-150

369
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
to F-350 types with all black canopies.

370
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Some featured antennae on top of the canopy,

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but all vehicles were all black.

372
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
No logos, symbols, chrome,

373
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
or metallic reflections were visible

374
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
off of any of the automobiles.

375
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Despite Castle and his fellow

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
VMA-513 Marines operating in uniform

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
with authority on U.S. soil,

378
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
half of the unmarked operators

379
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
intercepted the Marines at gunpoint.

380
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The Marines were disarmed, held at gunpoint,

381
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and threatened and ordered to stay silent.

382
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You know, so we're alert, but we're, you know,

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
we're, of course, tired,

384
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but we don't have night vision stuff.

385
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is low-tech, you know,

386
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
we're Marines and we've been through combat training,

387
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
but we're glorified mechanics,

388
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
so we know we're technicians.

389
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So there's a handful of tactical vehicles,

390
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
all black, and a team of about 30.

391
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What was the team doing?

392
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Not enough time to even evaluate that,

393
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
because the minute we came up over

394
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
about half of them, maybe 15,

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
came running up the hill towards us,

396
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and V formations with guns.

397
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What were they armed with?

398
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Subtype of, like, subtype machine gun.

399
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm not a guy who knows all the guns,

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but I did, I am an artist,

401
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and I have found a way to use AI

402
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
to help me with this process.

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I did send you a picture at one point,

404
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and maybe that could be shown.

405
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's exactly what they look like.

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Other than maybe, you know,

407
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
my picture ends up with a Caucasian skin tone at the top.

408
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Not necessarily the case,

409
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
but that's the only place any type of skin

410
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
for any of these men might have been shown.

411
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We'll show it on screen,

412
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
because of course we're working with that 3D artist

413
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
to recreate the scene,

414
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and to your specific specifications.

415
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So you're saying all black army helmets,

416
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
sometimes goggles, black,

417
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
what looks almost like a ski mask,

418
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
black fatigues, black tactical gear,

419
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
submachine gun.

420
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, like, you know,

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
classic black clad mercenary type.

422
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You know, again, I'm an artist,

423
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
so I'm going to see things through a lens,

424
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
sometimes through art and movies and comics,

425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and these were, if you want to,

426
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
you want to drop some evil villains

427
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and, you know, black clad mercenaries,

428
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
this is what these guys look like.

429
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah, right up harsh language.

430
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Get your ass down, get your ass down.

431
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Get your ass down.

432
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You know, not shooting,

433
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
but looking like they're ready to.

434
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You know, very close to our heads,

435
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
as if they didn't want us to look at anything.

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We felt, my initial reaction was,

437
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
we f***ed up, we came upon something

438
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that we shouldn't be involved in,

439
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and I'm just going to comply,

440
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
because I'm scared.

441
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You know, like again, we're Marines,

442
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
we're technicians,

443
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and our M16s are in the back of the truck,

444
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you know, in Iraq.

445
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Right.

446
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You guys are there for our suppression.

447
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Not even loaded.

448
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We don't have magazines on it.

449
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We're carrying two bells.

450
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Because you were, you know,

451
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
for the exercise,

452
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
harrier, crash or triple duty if needed.

453
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You're not there to be armed or station.

454
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No, no, you know, we fight if we need to fight,

455
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
but that's not our primary job.

456
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So these guys are harsh language head down,

457
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
they don't want you to see anything.

458
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So, and keep in mind this whole thing,

459
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
max four minutes, maybe three.

460
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's what I want people to know too,

461
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
is this was, this is a flash,

462
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
adrenaline filled witness event.

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You know, this is something I came across accidentally.

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And I see it now as some very positive,

465
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
mostly positive thing,

466
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
that, you know, it opened up some,

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
some avenues for me,

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
but as far as thinking,

469
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
but something I probably would have,

470
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
if things hadn't changed,

471
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
maybe, you know, in the last two, three years,

472
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
with the energy about this subject,

473
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the stigma I probably would have just taken

474
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
to my grave.

475
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You know, maybe told stories to excite,

476
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
you know, my grandkids or something.

477
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, Grandpa Roder's talking about that black triangle again.

478
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That was the first demands, you know, out of the vehicle.

479
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Out of the, out, out, out, out.

480
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Minimum language, which tells you they mean business.

481
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And I don't know how else to say it,

482
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but anybody that's been there knows what it feels like

483
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
when you know for certain,

484
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
this guy's probably this close from shooting you in the head.

485
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's a feeling, it's a real thing that all the acid

486
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
in your stomach just floods you, you know,

487
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you're flood, you're ready to die.

488
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

489
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, this was all happening at the same time,

490
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
in multiple ways,

491
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
because we all are affected by that trauma differently.

492
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So me, I might freeze,

493
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
because I'm starting to conceptualize the whole situation.

494
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
My other guy might get aggressive.

495
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Another guy might run.

496
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Did these guys, did they have any insignia,

497
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
any name tags, any claims?

498
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No, no, it's like completely black.

499
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
On purpose, obvious.

500
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You know, every truck was painted matte black.

501
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But they spoke with American dialect, right?

502
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The few that I could, that I heard.

503
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The Puss Watson.

504
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And they were very, they knew what they were doing,

505
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
because they knew certain guys talk,

506
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
certain guys don't, the rest, keep their mouth shut.

507
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So I know that your number one concern was for your life

508
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and the life of your fellow Marines.

509
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Could you tell what the rest of the convoy was doing,

510
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
what the trucks were doing,

511
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
what the Triangle was doing during this time?

512
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You know, of course, I've gone over this

513
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
in my head a billion times.

514
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I got my, my kind of theories,

515
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
but I'm not stuck on anything.

516
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It felt more like they were there with it.

517
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's some kind of overwatch.

518
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Maybe it was, why I was hovering right there, I don't know.

519
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
After approximately two minutes,

520
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
since first observing the craft,

521
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and whilst being detained by the operators,

522
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
the Triangle ceased its slow rotation counterclockwise,

523
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
climbed at an angle and darted to the Northwest

524
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
at an extremely high rate of speed.

525
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And remember that direction.

526
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But again, this craft took off with no visible auditory

527
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
or optical signs of propulsion or thrust.

528
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I did see it zoom to the Northwest,

529
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
which is the direction, the general direction of the road

530
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
at a very high rate of speed.

531
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Again, no, no noise, no exhaust, nothing.

532
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Just slow descent.

533
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So it, it rose up a little bit and then just darted?

534
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, like at an angle, at an angle.

535
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Did it curve or did it seem like the,

536
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the craft would be parallel to the ground?

537
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, yes.

538
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That's important, you know.

539
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Staying, staying like this.

540
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So it didn't turn at an angle, just rose up?

541
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, like it's on some kind of,

542
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
it needs to stay that direction.

543
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Did it seem like there was visible acceleration

544
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
or did this just?

545
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
At first it was like a, like maybe a slow buildup,

546
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
that angle, and then when it hit that, to nothing.

547
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Wow.

548
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Like a very tiny light to nothing, but you know.

549
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And that's what resonates with other reports I've heard.

550
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's just this rapid, rapid acceleration.

551
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The craft disappeared almost instantaneously and quickly.

552
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The black operators sprinted back down the hill,

553
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
boarded their tactical vehicles and drove off to the northwest

554
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
at a high rate of speed.

555
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
In a state of psychological shock,

556
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
the men tried and failed to start their humvees.

557
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The vehicles remained inoperable for several minutes.

558
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
They, they seem surprised as we were, but they were ready.

559
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Cause that's what they do.

560
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That was the sense they're doing their job.

561
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The minutes the thing was gone.

562
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
They've run back down the hill, back to their vehicles.

563
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They take off down that road.

564
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Same direction as a craft.

565
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We pick ourselves up.

566
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We're the only best way I can explain is state of shock

567
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
after a car accident or something.

568
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The one younger guy who was, you know, always,

569
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the one that talked the most, you know, he said,

570
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
you know, what's.

571
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know, I remember that distinctly.

572
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's like those first few moments after a car crash,

573
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
that something gets embedded.

574
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Um, got back in the vehicle, attempted to turn the humvee on.

575
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It would not start at first.

576
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Um, relatively rare.

577
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Um, you know, you got a, just a side switch to diesel engine.

578
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Pretty reliable.

579
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It took maybe five minutes to get it going

580
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and try it every minute.

581
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I am reminded here of Dr. Kevin Knuth

582
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
at the 2023 Soul Foundation,

583
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
where he discussed vehicle malfunctions in the presence of UFOs.

584
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You might recall the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

585
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
where Richard Dreyfus is in his truck investigating power outages

586
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and the UFO flies over his truck and the truck stops running.

587
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Um, McCamble in 1983 had identified several automobile interference types.

588
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You get engine disruption and failure.

589
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The engines sometimes fail to restart in the vicinity of a UFO.

590
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And when the UFO leaves, sometimes the engine restarts.

591
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
When I saw that in the movie, I was like, oh, this is just silly at this point.

592
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Oh, just restart.

593
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You can't just, how is the UFO magically restarting the engine?

594
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Um, well, if you think about the physics, you can reason through this.

595
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And this is what McCamble had done.

596
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
If you have a strong enough electric field around this UFO,

597
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you could possibly be ionizing the air.

598
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
How strong is this field got to be?

599
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's got to be on the order of three times ten to the six volts per meter.

600
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That'll short out the spark plugs in the car.

601
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It'll short out the distributor cam so the car will stop running.

602
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But this also brings up an interesting point.

603
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
If the VMA-513 Marines experienced vehicle failure,

604
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
this would imply the black operators and their ground tactical vehicles

605
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
were equipped with countermeasures,

606
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
maybe similar to something like a Faraday cage

607
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
to deflect the electromagnetic interference produced by the triangle,

608
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
arriving back to their quonset hut.

609
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The Marines were greeted by their gunnery sergeant and a warrant officer.

610
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The commanding officers checked on the Marines,

611
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
asked them about their mission and what they saw,

612
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and reminded the men whatever they encountered was just simple flares,

613
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and to not tell others.

614
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Um, we drive back to base our shift.

615
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This was like two, three.

616
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
We finished our shift just by standing by again.

617
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Not a lot of talking.

618
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Back to our quonset huts.

619
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
By 7 a.m., our gunnery sergeant and our chief warrant officer

620
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
was hanging out in our quonset hut, which is strange.

621
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Marines don't do things with a lot of words.

622
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
They do things by presence and implying something.

623
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Seems like they were checking in on us.

624
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We already knew what it was about,

625
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
but it's just like some flair activity out there, guys.

626
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

627
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It was implied we knew what they were saying.

628
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This is flares.

629
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You guys stumble across something.

630
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You shouldn't have seen, but no big deal.

631
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Now, it is my opinion the warrant officer and gunnery sergeant

632
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
were not briefed on the incident, the triangle or the black team.

633
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And this is because of the way USAP or unacknowledged

634
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
special access programs are conducted,

635
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
which I do believe, in fact, Castle encountered.

636
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Therefore, these commanding officers would not have a need to know

637
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
about the triangle or the operation.

638
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Therefore, I think it is highly likely bordering on absolute certainty.

639
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The commanding officers were informed Marines in their command

640
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
had encountered USAP operations and sensitive materials

641
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and were to remind their Marines to retain absolute silence

642
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
about their encounter.

643
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Now, one of the most intriguing pieces here is the day

644
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
following the incident, Castle was subject to an anthrax booster.

645
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Castle had, shortly before Hunter Warrior, already received a booster

646
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
for his already taken anthrax vaccine,

647
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
so why another immediately after the counter?

648
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Indeed, DOD mandates for all US military personnel

649
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to vaccinate against anthrax did not go effect until December 1997

650
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and from the Gulf War in 1991 up to 1997,

651
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
only some troops, if necessary, were given the anthrax vaccines and boosters.

652
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The following day, we were called to medical

653
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and given an anthrax booster, they called it.

654
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Now, as far as we knew, we had already been given the anthrax vaccine,

655
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
maybe a year prior.

656
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Right.

657
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It was always controversial, but we did it because we were told

658
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and in those days, there was a lot of grumbling among the Marines

659
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and there was usually a guy with a rifle near the medical area

660
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
where they're giving the anthrax, sometimes people would talk.

661
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So it doesn't feel like a suggestion you take?

662
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, again, a Marine thing, a suggestion that we're all taking this

663
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and keep your mouth shut.

664
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Had you already received like a booster?

665
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Because I know that, like you said, the anthrax vaccine was already controversial.

666
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I know that for some servicemen, it was forced if they were overseas,

667
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
the Middle East and later on.

668
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That's my question.

669
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It wasn't like we were getting ready to go somewhere where there had been a scare or something.

670
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It was just me and those guys.

671
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So again, it's hard not to get, but it was us and there was a guy with a rifle

672
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and we signed something like we did before.

673
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
First time we signed the, took the anthrax vaccine,

674
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
all of us signed something from what I remember.

675
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So after you take the booster, did anyone ever come up to you

676
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and tell you do not talk about what you saw after the Warren officer as well speaking to you?

677
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Were you ever forced to sign anything regarding the incident or just...

678
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Not about that. Nothing specific.

679
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Implied, implied.

680
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's a general feel that Marines will keep their mouth shut if told,

681
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
which is generally true.

682
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Now, of course, if it was just Castle here, I wouldn't be surprised.

683
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But knowing two other Marines with similar stories, of course, I asked.

684
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And to my surprise, I learned that both Michael Herrera and Jonathan Weygant

685
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
stated they were subject to anthrax boosters immediately after encountering.

686
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
In Weygant's case, a team of black operators and a crashed non-human UFO.

687
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And in Michael's case, a team of black operators and an enormous 300 foot diameter,

688
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle.

689
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Perhaps it really is too conspiratorial to think what could have possibly been

690
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the purpose of this anthrax booster, but it is a data point we simply cannot ignore.

691
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Following his exit from the Marine Corps, Castle attempted to push the encounter from his mind

692
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
while also dealing with the psychological trauma of being detained at gunpoint

693
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
by American operators on US soil.

694
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
By 2002, Castle had an additional bizarre experience

695
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
that may possibly relate to UFO legacy program operations.

696
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Wackenhut, now called G4S Solutions,

697
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
is a prominent private security firm founded in 1954

698
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
that is synonymous with UFO legacy programs.

699
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I have spoken about Wackenhut previously as the trainers to Department of Energy Special Response Teams,

700
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
or SRTs, which may have comprised the operators that detained and interrogated

701
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Jonathan Weygant in the jungles of northern Peru in late March, early April, 1997.

702
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I have also discussed Wackenhut's infamous board member, CIA Deputy Director,

703
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
NSA Director, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,

704
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Director of National Intelligence, Director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, Bobby Ray Inman.

705
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I have discussed Inman in numerous projects, so I recommend checking out any of these videos.

706
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's only become more significant now once I started doing some research

707
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and realizing possible sources of those type of mercenaries that do that work.

708
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And a combination of my Marine Brothers, Herrera, Weygant, hearing their stories and being like,

709
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
finally there was a triangle, enough information that I could start digging locations, contracts,

710
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
government contracts back in the 90s in the term, not the term, the company Wackenhut kept coming up.

711
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And then I remember I was recruited, not a recruit, I received a letter of an event, a recruiting event by them.

712
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:37,000
When I first got out of the reserves, the New York Army National Guard in 2002.

713
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And it was within three months of me getting out.

714
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:49,000
At the time I figured I'm just on a list of veterans, however they got that, they were data mining and they got my email.

715
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt,

716
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
if nothing else it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset.

717
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters.

718
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:15,000
They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1 Cobra's, Super Cobra's,

719
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
which I knew enough about that I could work on them.

720
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But that's interesting because you were just training as a helicopter flight medic, that wasn't your MOS, your MOS was?

721
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'd left the ordnance behind at the New York Air National Guard at Syracuse.

722
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So they knew something about you, if they knew that you were actively training as a helicopter flight medic.

723
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,000
In 2002, three years after he left service, Castle was approached out of the blue by Wackenhut to join their helicopter teams.

724
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Wackenhut seemingly knew all about Castle's military service record in training as a helicopter flight medic.

725
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But why discuss this, and why is Wackenhut important to mention,

726
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
and what significance can we find in Wackenhut attempting to contract a Marine Corps Sergeant,

727
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
who seemed to observe clandestine UFO legacy program operations?

728
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Well, aside from the possible involvement with the DOE NEST, or Nuclear Emergency Response Teams,

729
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
that brutalized Waygant and having Inman serve on their board of directors,

730
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Wackenhut is one of the most infamous and prolific private security agencies associated with UFO legacy program operations.

731
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Wackenhut has both been implicated with performing security for UFO legacy program sites,

732
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
or in Waygant's case, possibly involved with clandestine UFO crash retrieval operations.

733
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We mention Wackenhut only ever so briefly now, but please keep them in your mind for later for much more investigation,

734
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and the possibility that the team Castle observed was a Wackenhut trained and manned DOE SRT.

735
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security for many U.S. and DOE installations,

736
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and these include the Nevada Test Site and ever-elusive Groom Lake Area 51.

737
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Famously, Wackenhut worked perimeter security for Area 51 and caught Bob Lazar and his friends

738
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
who attempted to camp out on Bureau of Land Management Lands overlooking Dreamland

739
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
to observe test flights of the sports model UFO, quite an interesting little piece of UFO lore here.

740
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Now, let's finally analyze Castle's testimony in its entirety to transform a firsthand UFO encounter

741
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
into what I propose is a unique glimpse into UFO legacy program operations.

742
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Castle's sighting of the Triangle and its operational ground team occurred within the area of operations

743
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms.

744
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
During the 2nd to 14th March 1997, Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment

745
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
while Castle was attached to a special-purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.

746
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Recall how I mentioned earlier that true insights into Castle's testimony

747
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
occur when we analyzed the Hunter Warrior experiment out of USMC 29 Palm Center.

748
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Indeed, as I mentioned, I believe USMC's involvement in UFO legacy programs is slim to none

749
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and as you will see shortly, our analysis will turn us away from the USMC completely.

750
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Let's now briefly touch on again the Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment.

751
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Hunter Warrior sought to explore experimental methods to increase the area of influence

752
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and combat effectiveness of Marine units by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment

753
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and new warfighting tactics and techniques.

754
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
This experiment was conducted with three core objectives in mind,

755
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
tactical operations on the disperse non-contiguous battlefield,

756
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
C4I or command control communications computers and intelligence

757
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
to harness a single shared digital comms network over multiple battlefield areas

758
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
and enhancement of fire support and targeting improvements.

759
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Indeed, according to a 1997 USMC news release titled

760
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Findings Released on Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,

761
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Hunter Warrior could be neatly summarized as an experiment that, quote,

762
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
took a look at enhancing Marine units effectiveness

763
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,000
by utilizing a combination of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques, end quote.

764
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It is the same news release we can even garner insights on Castle's

765
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force

766
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
or as the USMC call it, SPM-A-G-T-F-X.

767
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
We can learn that this special task force was involved not only in the three objectives of Hunter Warrior,

768
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
but additionally all three phases which included

769
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Phase 1, focus on reconnaissance surveillance, shaping and deception operations

770
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
by both Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force

771
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and the Operating Aggressor Force.

772
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Phase 2, study of targeting for initial engagements by air

773
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and long-range indirect fire missions.

774
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And finally, Phase 3, major night movement by the Operating Forces,

775
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
additional targeting for the Task Force,

776
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
and culmination with a mobile raid on opposing forces.

777
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Recall how Castle's experience occurred

778
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
whilst performing overnight crash retrieval exercises for AV-8B Harrier jets.

779
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It is by considering this, I wager this incident occurred during the third phase of Hunter Warrior.

780
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And before we go any further, let's revisit a few details of Castle's encounter.

781
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Castle encountered a massive, exotic, human-made aerospace vehicle

782
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
that I will make the case was reverse engineered from non-human technology

783
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
alongside a heavily armed ground team equipped with tactical vehicles

784
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
resistant to the craft's electromagnetic effects.

785
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
This clandestine team was operating in the area of operations of, at the time,

786
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory

787
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
involving several ground and air combat units.

788
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Clearly, the Triangle and its clandestine Special Mission Unit

789
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
did not choose the remote uninhabited area of Emerson Dry Lakebed

790
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
that was right smack in the middle of the Hunter Warrior experiment

791
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
to be seen by friendly American servicemen.

792
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
The team chose an active warfighter experiment zone to operate in the shadows.

793
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Due to these factors, it is bordering on certainty

794
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
the Triangle and the clandestine team wish to operate on range

795
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
in the AO of the Hunter Warfighter experiment undetected.

796
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But what was their objective?

797
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I theorize this team and its craft secret via USAP,

798
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
or Intelligence Community CAP, Controlled Access Program.

799
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Wish to attach themselves to Hunter Warrior to train and run practice ops

800
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
alongside blue, a.k.a. friendly assets

801
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
while maintaining secrecy hidden out of sight from blue soldiers, personnel,

802
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
vehicles, comms, networks, etc.

803
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But let me explain.

804
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
As I have already mentioned,

805
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Castles' experience strikes similar chords to that of Herrera and Weigant.

806
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
In Weigant's case in 2009,

807
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
the young Marines stumbled upon a clandestine team

808
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
with tactical vehicles actively loading containers,

809
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
possibly filled with humans under an enormous

810
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
octagonal alien reproduction vehicle in the jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia.

811
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
In Weigant's case in 1997,

812
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
just days or a few weeks after Castles' experience,

813
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
the young Marine was detained and interrogated by a clandestine team

814
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
in all black that seemingly sprung out of nowhere

815
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
in the Peruvian jungle after Weigant and other Marines

816
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
had arrived to the scene of a crashed non-human object.

817
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
In all three scenarios,

818
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
young Marines performing their duties were held at gunpoint

819
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and threatened with death several times.

820
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
In one case, Castles, the earliest of the three,

821
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
the clandestine all black team fled once their overwatch triangle

822
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
darted out of sight, and clearly some commanding officer

823
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
or person of authority contacted USMC commanding officers

824
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
to make sure the Marines who stumbled upon the secret operation by accident

825
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
would not discuss encountering the USAP or CAP technology.

826
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
In the other two encounters,

827
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
the Marines were forcibly stripped of their gear, debriefed,

828
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and forced to sign extensive non-disclosure agreements

829
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
under penalty of death by senior Air Force personnel.

830
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
This series of events implies that after Castles' encounter,

831
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
systems were put in place for how these black teams

832
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
would actually deal with blue or friendly assets

833
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
stumbling upon their missions,

834
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
while conducting operations parallel but out of sight to blue assets.

835
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Although the triangle and team clearly failed

836
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
this hypothesized directive in Hunter Warrior

837
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
to operate in the shadows free from USMCIs,

838
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
this theory also supports that clearly

839
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
methods were developed to deal with such blue encounters moving forward.

840
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And indeed, I do have further statements to support this hypothesis.

841
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Recently, Ross Colthart has come out to state

842
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
he believes with high conviction that thanks to his many sources

843
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
the infamous tic-tac encountered by Commander David Fraver

844
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
of the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego in 2004

845
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
was Lockheed Martin's gunkworks technology.

846
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Now regarding this controversial statement,

847
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I have zero knowledge if the tic-tac was for sure human-made technology.

848
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I do, however, have my own framework that there are non-human tic-tacs

849
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and human-made copy tic-tacs,

850
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
but let's entertain Ross's theory here for a moment.

851
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
If, and I mean if the tic-tac was indeed reverse engineer technology

852
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
out of the Lockheed skunkworks,

853
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the flying propane tank like Kraft

854
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
operating in restrictive active US Navy airspace

855
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
that actually flew to the Navy aircraft cap point,

856
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
which cap is a combat air patrol designated reference point.

857
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Don't confuse this with controlled access program cap.

858
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Clearly sought to operate and test on blue assets.

859
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
In this case, Commander David Fraver in the VFA-41 Black Aces.

860
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Now, some of the arguments I have seen for the tic-tac not being man-made

861
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
are claims that the Navy or any US entity would never test technologies

862
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
on their own pilots and servicemen.

863
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But this is incorrect and this is actually done commonly.

864
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So, if the tic-tac was flying within the AO

865
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
or area of operations of the USS Nimitz aviation exercises,

866
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
this would imply the tic-tac could have been gauging reaction types,

867
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
times, speeds, methods, etc. of an unknowing force

868
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
if any blue assets were to ever make unknown enemy contact.

869
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Warning the pilots beforehand taint the results and observations.

870
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But remember, all this around the Nimitz is just a hypothesis.

871
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But if true clearly ties into CASEL and demonstrates instances

872
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
in which human-made reverse engineered vehicles

873
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
operate within acknowledged war games or large-scale warfighter experiments

874
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
to both test on blue assets and operate in the shadows parallel to blue assets.

875
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
The Nimitz here also gives us a perfect segue into the Navy.

876
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Why in the world would we discuss the Navy over USMC?

877
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Well, this is because I believe with very strong conviction might I add.

878
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The triangular craft and team operated at the behest of the US Navy

879
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
with likely cooperation or assets sharing with the US Air Force.

880
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Let me explain here, and this will shockingly tie into much of my previous work.

881
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Returning to the 1997 USMC news release Detailing Findings on Hunter Warrior

882
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
we can see both the Marine Corps Combat Development Center

883
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and the Center for Naval Analysis

884
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
release summary of experiment findings to the Deputy Commanding General of the MCCDC.

885
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
The Center for Naval Analysis,

886
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
administrated by the CNA Corporation, is a Department of Defense

887
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and Navy Federally-Funded Research and Development Center, or FFRDC

888
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
as we will call it from here on out.

889
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
If you are a longtime viewer of my channel, this is definitely old news.

890
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But if you are a new viewer to my channel,

891
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
the foundation of my research points to FFRDCs

892
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and how these semi-private government-controlled

893
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
research development tests and evaluation centers

894
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
act as liaison between the United States government

895
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
slash DOD and US defense contractors

896
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
for UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs

897
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
alongside their university counterparts,

898
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
university-affiliated research centers, or UARCs.

899
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Such institutions, according to my work,

900
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
serve as subject matter experts

901
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and provide necessary R&D work on project materials.

902
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
This would in turn keep knowledge access

903
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
in technology of unknown origin programs quite strict,

904
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
only allowing contractor personnel with the need to know full insights

905
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
into the full extent of the non-human materials on which the programs focus.

906
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs.

907
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
UARCs here include the applied physics laboratories at John Hopkins

908
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and the University of Washington,

909
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
as well as the applied research laboratories

910
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,

911
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
University of Texas at Austin,

912
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and Pennsylvania State University.

913
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Penn State's UARC was established in 1945

914
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
by future Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker.

915
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Walker is a critical figure in the research of my channel.

916
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board

917
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
as participating in 1950s UFO crash retrieval

918
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and reverse engineering programs alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.

919
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
If you want to learn more about Walker and Bush,

920
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
go watch my recent Aztec video.

921
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I especially recommend that video

922
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
because the Center for Naval Analysis

923
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
can trace its founding to 1942's anti-summery warfare operations group

924
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
that was formed to assist the U.S. Navy with scientific advice

925
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
for finding and attacking U-boats.

926
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Of course, in the Aztec video,

927
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
we devote over an hour to analyzing how and why.

928
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Scientists involved with anti-summery technology and warfare

929
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
working under Vannevar Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development

930
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
served as primary sources to details and findings

931
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:56,000
on the 25 March 1948 crashed 99.9 foot disc at Aztec, New Mexico.

932
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
A connection I never in a million years

933
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
would have thought to make to castle in this video,

934
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
but here we are.

935
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You will find nothing publicly

936
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
connecting the Center for Naval Analysis

937
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
to UFO legacy program operations.

938
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
These connections only exist in the words of my sources to me,

939
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
so take that for what you will.

940
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But why in the world would a naval FFRDC

941
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
publish findings on Hunter Warrior?

942
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Was this for a good old-fashioned corporate reporting write-up,

943
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
or in my opinion,

944
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
a secondary report created by a tendril of the naval involvement

945
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
in UFO legacy program operations

946
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
that could easily backchannel USAP slash CAP data, reports,

947
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and results of ARV applications alongside blue assets

948
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
back to the Navy while avoiding the marine chain of command?

949
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Well, as it turns out,

950
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
the US Navy was integral to Hunter Warrior,

951
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but not in a majorly acknowledged fashion.

952
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
In 1995, Vice Admiral Robert Spain,

953
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
then Commander of Naval Air Force Pacific,

954
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
detailed the possibility of getting naval carrier tactical aviation

955
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
involved in supporting troops ashore in a December 95 report titled,

956
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
quote,

957
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
an operational examination of sea-based aerial fire support

958
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
for engaged troops, end quote.

959
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
This proposed a new mission involving different training procedures

960
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and employment concepts for aircrews

961
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
operating from aircraft carriers in close concert

962
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
with ground forces in a non-linear battlefield.

963
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
At the behest of Admiral J. Johnson,

964
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Chief of Naval Operations, in late 1996,

965
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
General Charles Krulak, Commander of the Marine Corps,

966
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
quote, requested that Commander Naval Strike Air Warfare Center,

967
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Fallon, Nevada, assemble aircrews from Fallon

968
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
in Naval Air Station, LeMore, California

969
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
to explore the Hunter Air concept during Hunter Warrior,

970
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
which evaluated a wide variety of technologies

971
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and evolutionary tactics, end quote.

972
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
The involvement of two naval facilities,

973
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada,

974
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
now called the Naval Aviation Warfare Development Center, or NAWDC,

975
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
as we will call it from here on out,

976
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and the Naval Air Station, LeMore, California,

977
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
or NASA LeMore, as we will start calling it,

978
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
were an adjunct to Hunter Warrior,

979
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
bolted on late in the planning state.

980
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
According to my theory we're about to explore,

981
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
NAWDC and NASA LeMore entered into Hunter Warrior

982
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
at the last second,

983
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
realizing an opportunity to engage their ARV

984
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and special mission units in wargame exercise

985
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc.

986
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And of course, we have several avenues

987
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
to pursue to support this theory.

988
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Top Gunner, what really is called

989
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Naval Strike Air Warfare Center,

990
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
came here in 1996,

991
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and the Naval Air Station has been here for us

992
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
a lot longer than that,

993
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and it's a tenant command at the base

994
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
that does a lot of its training and learning

995
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and its universities out there

996
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
when they prepare and train in the desert.

997
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
In projects past, I have detailed at length

998
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
programs and efforts of the U.S. Navy

999
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
to retrieve, exploit, and store non-human vehicles.

1000
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I really recommend if you haven't seen that,

1001
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
stopping now and watching my video

1002
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
on Navy UFO Legacy Program Operations

1003
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and come back, which explores everything

1004
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
from the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office

1005
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
to Admiral Bobby Ray Inman

1006
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
to the Deep Submergence Systems Project

1007
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
to a 1991 Deep Sea Triangle UFO Recovery.

1008
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But we will stick to Castle here

1009
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
and get to know NAWDC and Nassla Mour a little more.

1010
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
NAWDC is the Navy's center of excellence

1011
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
for air combat training and development.

1012
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
NAWDC trains naval aviation

1013
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
in advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures

1014
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
across assigned combat mission areas

1015
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
at the individual unit integrated in joint levels,

1016
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
ensuring alignment of the training continuum

1017
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
to set and enforce combat proficiency standards

1018
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
to develop, validate, standardize, publish,

1019
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
and revise tactics, techniques, and procedures."

1020
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
NAWDC was set up in 1996

1021
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
to consolidate the Naval Strike Warfare Center,

1022
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
the Navy Fighter Weapon School Top Gun,

1023
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
in the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapon School Top Dome.

1024
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
NAWDC provides service to aircrews, squadrons,

1025
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and airwings of the U.S. Navy

1026
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
through flight training, academic instructional classes,

1027
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and direct operational and intelligence support.

1028
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And remember that I said Navy Flight Training

1029
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
in the Top Gun School here.

1030
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm sure none of you need reminding to Top Gun or Top Gun Maverick.

1031
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Attention on deck!

1032
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Good morning.

1033
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Welcome to your special training detachment.

1034
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You see it.

1035
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Emmanuel Bates, NAWDC commander.

1036
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
You're all Top Gun graduates.

1037
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
The elite.

1038
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The best of the best.

1039
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That was yesterday.

1040
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter

1041
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
has leveled the playing field.

1042
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Details are few, but you'll be able to see

1043
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
details are few, but you can be sure

1044
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
we no longer possess the technological advantage.

1045
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Success, now more than ever,

1046
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

1047
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Half of you will make the cut.

1048
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
One of you will be named mission leader.

1049
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
The other half will remain in reserve.

1050
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Your instructor is a Top Gun graduate

1051
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
with real-world experience in every mission aspect

1052
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
you will be expected to master.

1053
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
His exploits are legendary.

1054
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots

1055
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
this program has ever produced.

1056
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
What he has to teach you may very well

1057
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
mean the difference between life and death.

1058
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

1059
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Call sign Maverick.

1060
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
This is the first time I've ever seen

1061
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
an officer in the Navy.

1062
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
The Navy is the most successful

1063
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
intelligence in the office of naval research

1064
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
as spearheading numerous U.S. Navy

1065
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
UFO legacy programs.

1066
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
NAWDC is also, quote,

1067
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
the primary authority on training and tactics

1068
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
development.

1069
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
NAWDC provides training, assessment,

1070
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
aviation requirement recommendations,

1071
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
combat search and rescue, close air support,

1072
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
and associated planning support systems, end quote.

1073
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Funny enough, this naval facility

1074
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
out of Fallon, Nevada also runs the FTRC

1075
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
or the Fallon Range and Training Complex.

1076
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
An enormous training range just north

1077
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
of the Nevada Test Site and Nevada Test

1078
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and Training Range MRTFB,

1079
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
or Major Range and Test Facility Base,

1080
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
used extensively by Area 51 Groom Lake,

1081
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
a detachment of Edwards 412 Test Wing.

1082
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
A long time critical component of my work

1083
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
has been discussion of air training ranges

1084
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
for UFO legacy program operations.

1085
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Specifically, test and operational flight testing

1086
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
of reproduction vehicles.

1087
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
This subject will come up again soon,

1088
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
critical in my opinion, to solving the who,

1089
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
what, and why of Castle's Encounter.

1090
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Now, I have discussed at length aerial training ranges

1091
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
such as Dugway's Utah Test and Training Range,

1092
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Area 51 and Nellis' Nevada Test and Training Range,

1093
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
and Edwards 412 Test Wing, Restricted Flight Airspace

1094
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and directly accused each of these locations

1095
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
of operating and testing alien reproduction vehicles

1096
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
on these ranges.

1097
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Therefore, it is intriguing to me,

1098
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
NAWDC and Fallon, Nevada extremely close

1099
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
to both the NTTR and UTTR

1100
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
and added as adjunct to Hunter Warrior

1101
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
employs its own enormous aerial training range complex.

1102
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And of course, NAWDC is no stranger to sightings of triangles.

1103
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
In 2002, a witness in Fallon, Nevada reported a quote

1104
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
very large craft at 11.13 p.m.

1105
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
that he thought at first was a B-52.

1106
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It was a huge flying triangle with no running lights,

1107
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
but it did have some 7-9 dimly lit nodes.

1108
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It flew at 20 miles per hour making no noise.

1109
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It was astonishingly close and so large.

1110
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Total event time was 8 seconds.

1111
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
The witness had a clear view of the side and bottom of the ship

1112
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
but could not make out the leading edge or rear of the craft.

1113
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Welcome to Naval Air Station LaMoure,

1114
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
the Navy's newest, largest and only West Coast master jet face.

1115
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
NAS LaMoure is home port for every Navy strike fighter squadron

1116
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
on the West Coast.

1117
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
These squadrons are equipped with F-A-18 Hornet

1118
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
and Sufer Hornet aircraft.

1119
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The Air Station's new 9 million dollar air traffic control tower

1120
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
is part of the Navy's largest and busiest air traffic control facility.

1121
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
NAS LaMoure is the Navy's newest and largest master jet base

1122
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
located in Northern California.

1123
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
LaMoure is home to several carrier air wings

1124
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
as well as the entire strike fighter wing Pacific.

1125
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And just as NAWDC,

1126
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
NAS LaMoure is no stranger to triangle sightings.

1127
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
These include the 2001 testimony

1128
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
of Navy Aviation Maintenance Administrator Angelo Assetta

1129
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
who stated he observed a triangular glowing object

1130
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
with white glowing points above FRC West NAS LaMoure.

1131
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
After observing the craft travel slowly for three minutes,

1132
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
the vehicle departed at a seemingly instantaneous speed out of sight.

1133
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Assetta claimed to observe the same vehicle four times between February

1134
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
to October 2012 with no response from the Naval Air Station.

1135
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
NAS LaMoure also shares some intriguing ties

1136
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
with a usual tricky customer of this channel.

1137
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
An Air Force Base I suspect is intimately involved

1138
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
in ARV testing and flight programs.

1139
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Edwards and their illustrious 412 test wing.

1140
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And just remember Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

1141
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
claimed to observe man-made triangular craft called TR-3B

1142
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
and don't worry we will explore this more shortly

1143
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
over Edwards Air Force Base less than 90 miles away from Castles Encounter.

1144
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
One night a longtime friend of mine

1145
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
and I were standing on top of the Fairchild A-10 hangar

1146
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
at Edwards Air Force Base.

1147
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It was 2 a.m. and a perfectly clear night

1148
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
with millions of stars visible to the naked eye.

1149
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
This was a very common night at Edwards.

1150
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I noticed a group of stars

1151
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
who were looking at it seemed to be shifting in color

1152
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and at the time I could name quite a few constellations.

1153
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I had just taken an astrology course

1154
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and definitely knew what the Big Dipper was.

1155
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I made a C and I made a C in that course I think or B.

1156
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So I put it out to my friend that the three stars near the Big Dipper

1157
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
in triangular formation were not supposed to be there.

1158
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
We watched as the strobing stars shifted in color

1159
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
from a bright blue to a reddish yellow.

1160
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
After a period of about 20 minutes

1161
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
we could tell that the objects weren't stars

1162
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
because they were getting larger.

1163
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
This was somewhat unnerving.

1164
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It was further unnerving when the space in between the stars

1165
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
started blocking out the stars in the background.

1166
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
We decided it probably was the top secret Air Force vehicle of some type.

1167
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Still we weren't sure.

1168
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
At the time I didn't believe in UFOs.

1169
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That's the honest truth.

1170
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
The vehicle had gone from half the size of the Big Dipper

1171
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
to twice its size in a half hour.

1172
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It had moved from the west to the east towards Edwards Air Force Base.

1173
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
About that time we could make out the silhouette or outline of the triangle.

1174
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The lights were possibly exhaust, flared brighter

1175
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and vanished in an instant from the sky.

1176
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Of course, as the primary naval facility involved with Hunter Warrior

1177
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I do believe a strong case can be built.

1178
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
The triangle castle observed hailed from Nautic,

1179
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
but I do for a little bit want to explore the concept

1180
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
that the triangle could have come from Nassla-Mor, Edwards

1181
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
or some sort of combination between the two.

1182
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Now, do you recall all the way back in this investigation

1183
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
where I mentioned Castle's encounter occurred within the FAA airspace

1184
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
designated as R-2501C?

1185
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Well, Nassla-Mor is one of few facilities that has access to the R-2508 complex,

1186
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
a section of restricted airspace and associated land

1187
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
presently used and managed by three principal military activities

1188
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
in the Upper Mojave Desert region.

1189
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
The R-2508 complex is compromised of internal restricted areas,

1190
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
military operations areas, air traffic control assigned airspace areas

1191
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
and other special use airspaces.

1192
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Use of these areas include bombing ranges, supersonic corridors,

1193
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
low-altitude high-speed maneuvers, radar intercept areas and refueling areas.

1194
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
The R-2508 sits near Antelope Valley,

1195
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
a location containing several aerospace facilities, RCS or radar cross-section ranges,

1196
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
and proposed deep underground military bases I've directly accused

1197
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,000
with UFO legacy program operations, largely Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

1198
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
R-2508 is managed by the National Training Center for Irwin,

1199
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Naval Air Weapon Station, China Lake,

1200
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
and the 412th Test Wings Air Force Test Center out of Edwards Air Force Base.

1201
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
In fact, alongside Edwards, China Lake, and Palmdale Plant 42,

1202
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
which I have discussed extensively,

1203
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and Jeremy Corbell has recently listed street addresses

1204
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
for calling for Congress to investigate UFO legacy sites with boots on the ground.

1205
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
NASLAMOR now joins three other major entities I've connected to UFO legacy programs

1206
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
with R-2508 Poncho 3 Clearance.

1207
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Poncho 3 Clearance allows only locally-based aircraft

1208
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
in specific restricted sections of R-2508,

1209
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
and I bring up R-2508 not just because of Edwards

1210
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and its proximity to CASEL's encounter,

1211
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but because of R-2508 and its principal entities.

1212
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I have spoken at length previously regarding China Lake,

1213
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
UFO programs, and accused deep underground military bases.

1214
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
But Edwards, well, Edwards and its 412th Test Wing

1215
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
are one of the cornerstone pieces of my work.

1216
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Recall Ed.

1217
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Ed is a very real, very vetted individual I consider a hostile witness.

1218
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
A witness who was summoned by SSCI or the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

1219
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and talked nonsense to avoid implication in illegal programs.

1220
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Ed spoke to Steven Greer, divulging many details regarding Edwards Air Force Base,

1221
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and Ed has blocked me on every single platform from which I have contacted him.

1222
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Ed began his Air Force career at the Nevada Test and Training Range,

1223
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
specifically Nellis Air Force Base, while this NTTR was still called the 98th Range Wing.

1224
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
As an engineering requirements manager with a degree in electrical engineering,

1225
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Ed claimed he was briefed at Area 51-S4 by an Air Force major into UFO programs.

1226
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Ed was told numerous craft had been caught or captured,

1227
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:44,000
and it was at Nellis Ed became aware of joint UFO programs with specifically Lockheed and Boeing.

1228
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
By the early 2000s, Ed was sent to Edwards for further range engineering work for Air Force

1229
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and DOD Premier Test and Evaluation Expertise for Aerospace Vehicles.

1230
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Ed managed the Air Force Flight Test Center, AFFTC, Experimental and Development Test and Evaluation Engineering Resources.

1231
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
This is where barriers are broken.

1232
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
This is where records are set.

1233
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
This is the edge of what we are capable of.

1234
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,000
This is where we look into a new frontier and see the future.

1235
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
To fly faster, longer and safer.

1236
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
To make our warriors stronger and our enemies tremble.

1237
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
To push the boundaries of what we know is possible.

1238
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:57,000
To deliver capabilities to the warfighter that will write history.

1239
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Our mission is test.

1240
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Our goal is to find the unknown.

1241
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
We learn all there is about our technology and we go further.

1242
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
We set the standard.

1243
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
We are innovators.

1244
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Ed was also sent to Edwards Range Orientation as a student in Edwards Infamous 412th Test Wing Air Force Test Pilot School.

1245
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:41,000
For multiple years at the Edwards 412th AFFTC, Ed served as Director of Operations for an electronics warfare group operating an acknowledged test infrastructure budget of $700 million.

1246
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Directly supervising 15 officers, civilians and enlisted personnel.

1247
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It was as director of an electronics warfare group, Ed claimed to act as the intermediary between scientists and AFFTC pilots of reverse engineered vehicles.

1248
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Vehicles reverse engineered from extraterrestrial technology, copycat vehicles sometimes manned requiring a pilot, sometimes not.

1249
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Ed's testimony has so much more to give as do clues to his testimony such as project red light.

1250
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So please watch my video on him to explore further statements of biologics likely being stored at Wright Patterson Hangar 5.

1251
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Videos of essentially invisible inspection UFOs and Ed's follow-up career at the Pentagon Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel Chain.

1252
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Where he observed $34 and $40 billion in respective years go towards non-transfer of authority funds.

1253
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I vehemently believe Ed's testimony and due to such, Edwards 412th Test Wing is one of the most critical sites, wings and air spaces to uncovering UFO legacy program operations in my opinion.

1254
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But that's not all. Recall the infamous story of the TR-3B as relayed by Edgar Fouchet.

1255
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It's exactly what the flying triangle is, the one that's been sighted around the world.

1256
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built.

1257
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And it may be stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium or your city.

1258
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Fouchet would disclose his testimony from himself and his five close friends slash sources in 1998.

1259
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Many have criticized the Air Force Master Sergeant Fouchet for his lack of evidence.

1260
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But as I have said many times, I have found tremendous value in studying Fouchet's disclosures.

1261
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:43,000
According to Fouchet, TR-3B saw prototype flights begin in the early 1970s with successful implementation of gravity warping systems.

1262
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Fouchet would state three operational prototype systems were flying by 1994.

1263
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Triangles approximately 250 feet across, quite similar to castles 200 to 300 feet.

1264
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
As well as an enormous 600 foot operational model.

1265
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Finally I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B.

1266
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,000
A friend of mine said he'd never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom.

1267
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers.

1268
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:27,000
According to Fouchet, the engineering of TR-3B was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan

1269
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and TR-3B's program was managed by three of six of the US Big Six intelligence agencies, NRO, NSA and CIA.

1270
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Fouchet would claim the gravity warping propulsion systems were reverse engineered from non-human technology from Sandia National Labs and Lawrence Livermore Labs.

1271
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Two Department of Energy FFRDCs, and Sandia is of course, as I say, a usual tricky customer of this channel.

1272
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,000
The circular plasma field accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field Disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.

1273
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology.

1274
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse engineered DMF-D and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology.

1275
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you, nor am I.

1276
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The government will go at any lengths.

1277
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury based.

1278
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute

1279
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy.

1280
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:51,000
The MF-D generates a magnetic vortex field which disrupts and neutralizes effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%.

1281
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.

1282
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.

1283
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:08,000
The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator such as the crew compartment, avionics, MF-D systems, fuels, environmental systems,

1284
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%.

1285
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:20,000
This causes the effect of making the aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed,

1286
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
except of course those we didn't build.

1287
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,000
TR-3B is an altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time.

1288
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude.

1289
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:44,000
With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally.

1290
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn.

1291
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance.

1292
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
For those that have seen it, that's how they do it.

1293
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:06,000
TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform.

1294
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The multi-mode propulsion systems can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor

1295
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion.

1296
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
By Fouchet's definition, this makes TR-3B an alien reproduction vehicle.

1297
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
While the craft featured some systems we might associate with prosaia technology such as a triangular airframe,

1298
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,000
odd but still recognizable rotatable crew compartments, computers, radar, and ECM,

1299
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
or electronics communications measures and ECCM systems, the craft also featured propulsion systems

1300
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
reverse engineered from non-human technology.

1301
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
This then of course draws our attention back to 1988's Fluxliner,

1302
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that allegedly operated as a copycat saucer with non-human zero-point systems,

1303
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,000
but also featured disheveled F4 Phantom jump seats and sloppy paints as well as bolted panels.

1304
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:11,000
The ARV system for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities was indeed remarkably simple.

1305
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia

1306
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:24,000
with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought.

1307
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy,

1308
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes.

1309
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off.

1310
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Of course, Castle saw only the underside and little of the side profile of the triangle

1311
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
during this experience in the first half of March 1997.

1312
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:54,000
But I cannot help but draw strong parallels between the craft Castle observed and Fuchet's TR-3B.

1313
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Obvious parallels include the 200-foot models detailed by Fuchet resembling the 200-300-foot parameters outlined by Castle,

1314
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
but also reference here Fuchet's detailed illustration of TR-3B.

1315
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
While working with a 3D artist to model Castle's craft,

1316
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
one of the points Castle was absolutely adamant about was that the lights on each vertex of the triangle

1317
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:24,000
appeared like embedded spherical orb lights and not flush lighting panels.

1318
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Although not orb or spherical, we can observe non-flush lights on Fuchet's illustrations

1319
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that Fuchet described as hydrogen-oxygen-vectored rocket engines to aid in craft propulsion.

1320
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Additionally, Castle firmly stated each corner of the equilateral triangle was rounded,

1321
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
and the same can be seen in TR-3B.

1322
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Although the craft was almost vantablack, meaning blacker than black with low reflectivity,

1323
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Castle observed what appeared to be a concave dome-like structure,

1324
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
unlit in the middle of the triangle.

1325
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:05,000
We can clearly see the Mercury Plasma Accelerator Ring MFD Gravity Reduction Device on TR-3B

1326
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
sitting as a large circular feature on the underside of TR-3B.

1327
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:17,000
The strongest parallel to me, though, comes in the description of variable-vectored intake vents on TR-3B

1328
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
observable from the top, bottom, and side profiles of the craft.

1329
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
While witnessing primarily the underbelly of the triangle,

1330
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Castle discussed what appeared to be several ridges or vents between each spherical light on each vertex of the triangle.

1331
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Could Castle's craft indeed have been the infamous alien reproduction vehicle TR-3B illustrated by Edgar Fouchet?

1332
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Well, believe it or not, there are even further data points bolstering this hypothesis.

1333
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:55,000
But Fouchet's most drastic revelations of TR-3B comes from who he claimed piloted the vehicles.

1334
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Fouchet would state both military and contractors operated TR-3B,

1335
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
but military pilots were top of their class, elite pilots hailing from the Air Force and Navy test pilot schools

1336
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,000
like Top Gun stationed at the NAWDC and AFFTC stationed at Edwards.

1337
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Could Edwards and NAWDC slash NASLAMOR slash naval programs at large

1338
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
really have coordinated to operate reverse-engineered triangular craft

1339
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and special mission units alongside blue assets in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment?

1340
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
While as it turns out, there is even more circumstantial data to suggest so.

1341
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:47,000
The southernmost area of R2508 exists roughly 44.5 miles northwest of Emerson Dry Lakebed.

1342
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And recall Castle's testimony when the triangle departed at incomprehensible speeds.

1343
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:02,000
It traveled in a northwest direction back to the direction of R2508 airspace operated by NASLAMOR, China Lake, and Edwards.

1344
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Back to the direction of Antelope Valley, which for decades has produced myriad UFO triangle testimonies.

1345
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Back to the direction where Fouchet claimed the Navy and Air Force top pilots operated TR-3B.

1346
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And back to the direction in which Ed had years of first-hand experience with reverse-engineered vehicles.

1347
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
While I do believe TR-3B, or whatever you want to call a triangular ARV,

1348
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:39,000
R2508, Edwards, NAWDC, and NASLAMOR are cornerstone and critical pieces to this investigation and my prevailing theory.

1349
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I do want to explore an alternate origin point for the craft, still involving naval and Air Force UFO legacy program operations.

1350
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Edwards and its R2508 are nestled within Antelope Valley.

1351
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Antelope Valley has historically served as the nexus of U.S. aerospace technology.

1352
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Housing the infamous Air Force Plant 42, Lockheed's Gunkwerks, the former Norton Air Force Base,

1353
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:15,000
the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, and facilities Northrop Grumman, Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas operate as radar cross-section facilities.

1354
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,000
These three radar cross-section facilities, specifically Northrop Tahan and Lockheed Hellendale,

1355
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
are locations I have discussed extensively in prior work.

1356
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Antelope Valley in Palmdale, California has served as a cornerstone U.S. military-slash-private contractor-classified aircraft production and maintenance location.

1357
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:46,000
With Air Force Plant 42 alone producing many of the United States' most famous advanced aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk,

1358
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:55,000
the B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk, SR-71 Blackbird, F-22, and F-35 Lightning,

1359
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:03,000
and as I stated earlier, Corbell recently listed street addresses for Plant 42 in relation to UFO legacy program operations.

1360
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:13,000
First and foremost is Senator Rounds should ask to see Lockheed's Plant B-6 complex in Burbank, California, 2300 Empire Avenue,

1361
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and then I would like to, you know, maybe he should go ask to see Northrop Grumman's Plant 42 in Palmdale, which is 3520 East Avenue M Street.

1362
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I mean, look, the addresses are there.

1363
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:33,000
While any of these aerospace locations mentioned above could have, and in my opinion do, engage in engineering, research development,

1364
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:43,000
test and evaluation, and construction of ARV in the Antelope Valley, I do want to center our attention to the radar cross-section facilities Tehan and Hellendale.

1365
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But what is an RCS facility?

1366
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
To summarize, these locations utilize high-frequency radio waves to test aircraft radar signatures.

1367
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing radar cross-section.

1368
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:10,000
The radar cross-section sites utilize large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.

1369
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Many RCS facilities such as the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War.

1370
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:27,000
This led the majority of the installations being built primarily underground to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies from Soviet spy satellites.

1371
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Numerous researchers over the years have accused the Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft.

1372
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:56,000
The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrances for the Ant Hill Dome as well as actually been flown over these sites and personally observed the electromagnetic pulse weapons systems that are used to down craft.

1373
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this.

1374
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:11,000
The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it.

1375
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.

1376
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

1377
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It's just where the manmade UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.

1378
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,000
They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-grabbitic anti-grab.

1379
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:46,000
The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic.

1380
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
They just go boom up, but they're placed over different diamonds.

1381
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these. We don't have time to go through.

1382
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.

1383
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I myself have covered extensively the legends of Tehan and rumors of an enormous underground installation connecting Tehan to Edwards, China Lake, and myriad UFO legacy program sites.

1384
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Go watch my video on Dumbs or Northrop to learn more there.

1385
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We study Tehan in Hellendale because of the artwork of forensic artist Bill MacDonald in his 1992 piece Tohachapi Triangle.

1386
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:39,000
MacDonald met with four old engineers at the Denny's and Antelope Valley in the spring of 1992.

1387
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Two of the engineers hailed from Lockheed Hellendale RCS plants and two hailed from Northrop Tehan RCS plants.

1388
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Fed up with the security, quote unquote, impositions that affected their quality of life and the locations at which they were required to live out a significant portion of their lives.

1389
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:03,000
The engineers dictated a craft they had designed and constructed called the XF-131 Supercentinal.

1390
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:15,000
As I have said before, MacDonald was then contacted by Chris Carter of the X-Files to include the very real XF-131 in Season 1, Episode 1 of the X-Files.

1391
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I have talked to MacDonald personally, attempting to contact these engineers, but MacDonald is unwilling to reveal their identities and I respect his decision.

1392
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Could, less likely in my opinion, instead of TR-3B, the triangular craft bin and XF-131 Supercentinal kept in the bowels of Tehan or Hellendale that saw regular test flights over R2508 with pilots from the AFFTC.

1393
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:59,000
That was called to action by NAWDC and NASLAMOR to conduct test operations in the Haunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, aiming to get ARV teams on ground, undetected in areas populated by blue forces.

1394
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I do, lastly, want to tie everything to Castle being contacted by Wackenhut in 2002.

1395
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:22,000
When the security contractor attempted to recruit Castle into their helicopter teams, Castle remarked to me how bizarre it was, Wackenhut seemingly knew everything about him.

1396
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:31,000
But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt, if nothing else, it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset.

1397
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters.

1398
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:49,000
They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1s, Cobra's, Super Cobra's.

1399
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And this leads me to a theory I'd like to propose.

1400
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:11,000
This theory says that the team Castle encountered in 1997 was not Air Force or Navy enlisted personnel, JSOC or Joint Special Operations Command or SOCOM Special Operations Command teams, but instead a private team from Wackenhut working with the Navy and Air Force.

1401
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:22,000
In this theory, in 2002, Wackenhut attempted to recruit Castle to these clandestine teams, possibly to a group like the infamous quote-unquote Blue Boys.

1402
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Alleged UFO crash retrieval rapid response teams operating from within US military bases employing helicopter units.

1403
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:42,000
As I stated earlier, Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security, for many US DoD and Department of Energy installations.

1404
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And these included the Nevada test site, the Ever Elusive Groom Lake Area 51, and Los Alamos National Labs.

1405
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And additionally, Wackenhut allegedly served as a CIA front in the Cold War and beyond.

1406
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:07,000
A theory likely proven in the JFK files in a released March 1963 memo detailing the Wackenhut Corporation wishing to serve as cover for the CIA.

1407
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank excellent researcher Blocked Epistemology for this find.

1408
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:22,000
In the 1989 book The Terrorism Industry by Edward S. Herman, the board of Wackenhut and connections to US intelligence agencies was scrutinized.

1409
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Remember how in my SAIC video, I referred to SAIC by its nickname, NSA West, as so many US DoD and intelligence officials traded their stars and stripes in for business suits at SAIC.

1410
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:45,000
It seems that Wackenhut operated as a similar revolving door for accomplished military and intelligence professionals.

1411
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:55,000
In his book, Herman discussed how two figures I've associated with UFO legacy program operations in the past served on the board of Wackenhut in the 1980s.

1412
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:08,000
And this is not to mention Bobby Ray Inman, a pillar stone of US intelligence, SAIC, and Wackenhut, I believe is one of the most key members to UFO programs in history.

1413
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:22,000
One such figure mentioned by Herman was Frank Carlucci, US Secretary of Defense, and an individual I wagered may have been alongside Brad Sorenson to the classified section of the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show,

1414
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
where flux liner alien reproduction vehicles were observed.

1415
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Additionally on the Wackenhut board was William F. Raybourne, who also served on the board of SAIC and was also the director of the Polaris Summary Program in the US Navy.

1416
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Navy Chief Scientist of Special Projects, John Pena Craven, stated he was ordered to carry out the Deep Submergence Systems project to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform deep ocean engineering.

1417
01:37:51,000 --> 01:38:03,000
To satisfy the whims of one project's sand dollar, a project that had cataloged every item of US national security interest resting on the sea floor tagged for retrieval.

1418
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:14,000
According to Craven, this program was nestled within another program, nestled within another, itself hidden within another program nestled under the Polaris Summary Program.

1419
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:24,000
To understand why I made the case sand dollar involved undersea UFO crash retrieval, go watch my US Navy Legacy Operations video.

1420
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:36,000
In my video on Jonathan Weigandt, I proposed a theory that the UFO crash retrieval team were Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy Special Response teams or SRTs.

1421
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:46,000
But overall wager, the crash retrieval team was more likely nearby US Army Green Berets recruited as special mission unit for USAT procedures.

1422
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:55,000
But let's talk a little bit about SRT. This anti-nuclear terrorism team is the DOE's own elite task force.

1423
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:12,000
An elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across the United States, the special response team has arrest on site authority and at least in the 1980s donned all black outfits and gear similar to the outfits described by CASEL.

1424
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Historically, in the late 90s, DOE SRT units also provided security for sensitive DOE defense nuclear facilities including Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs.

1425
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
These DOE SRT teams were trained by Wackenhut.

1426
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And not just trained by Wackenhut, but these elite, highly capable DOE SRTs were comprised of Wackenhut employees.

1427
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:49,000
According to the General Accounting Office, beginning in 1987, Wackenhut subcontracted Department of Energy Guard Services, not only A,

1428
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,000
controlled access to sites, conducting roving patrols of site perimeters and responded to physical security alarms,

1429
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,000
B, conducted property searches and inspections of facilities, personnel, and vehicles,

1430
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
and C, provided protection for classified and unclassified documents and other government property and facilities,

1431
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:16,000
but also that Wackenhut provided special response teams to act at the behest of the DOE.

1432
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:31,000
SRTs are really no joke. These individuals are the ultimate Department of Energy, INDUSEC, or industrial security team entrusted with transporting nuclear materials around the continental United States.

1433
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:44,000
One of the reasons I suspected Wackenhut DOE SRT was not involved in Wagan's case is because SRTs historically have acted within the continental United States, not abroad.

1434
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:53,000
After all, these Wackenhut trained and staffed teams do have arrest authority in quote-unquote recovery operations on U.S. soil.

1435
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So, what if the Special Mission Unit, accompanying the Triangle during Hunter Warrior, was indeed a Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy SRT

1436
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:13,000
that acted parallel to CASEL, who was busy and dutifully engaging in USMC AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval exercises?

1437
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:27,000
This clandestine SRT unit instead operated alongside Navy and Air Force ARV programs, engaged in UFO crash retrieval exercises within the continental United States.

1438
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:39,000
When investigating the case of Jonathan Waganth, I arrived to the conclusion based off of several lines of thinking the on-site scientific team securing the UFO crash site was DOE NEST,

1439
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:51,000
or DOE Nuclear Emergency Response Team. Part of my rationale here is the fact DOE NEST's governing authority is the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement.

1440
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:06,000
The Schumer Rounds UFO legislation called the UAPDA references this 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement as a system leverage to improperly classify UFO materials, hardware, biologics, etc.

1441
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:18,000
as, quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear information, end quote. This same logic here for Waganth and DOE NEST applies to CASEL and DOE SRT.

1442
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:40,000
If SRT units, formally trained and staffed by Waganthut, are indeed conducting domestic UFO crash retrieval operations, just as with NEST, the DOE could likely leverage the same 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement to effectively black hole any UFO retrieval operations, recovered materials, etc.

1443
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I myself have personally heard rumors from sources of UFO crashes being transported across the continental United States, haphazardly labeled nuclear material and guarded by SRT.

1444
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:18,000
After all, if UFO materials are indeed obfuscated under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act as trans-classified foreign nuclear information, which I fully believe it does, does it not make perfect sense highly trained DOE SRTs entrusted with transporting U.S. nuclear materials and weapons would be the same operators to transport recovered craft?

1445
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:36,000
If this team observed by CASEL was indeed Waganthut, this wouldn't be the first time Waganthut suffered such a folly. Meet Richard Mingus, a federal services security guard at the Nevada Test Site from 1957 to 1953, who often times worked at Area 51.

1446
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:48,000
In 1982, Mingus was securing an underground nuclear test area at Area 6 on the Nevada Test Site while the base featured a live nuclear bomb exposed above ground.

1447
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:57,000
While lowering the bomb underground for explosives testing, the base at Area 6 quickly came under attack by armed combatants.

1448
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Mingus was primarily responsible for coordinating the breach of security up through the chain of command, all the way up to President Ronald Reagan as the event was a significant national security issue.

1449
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:18,000
It was later determined the men attacking were simply conducting a drill from where else but Waganthut.

1450
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:55,000
In late April, early March, if this was late April, I believe this was the last one or two days of April into early March, and this is the time that he actually reached out to David Grush and expressed his willingness and desire to both testify to and deliver his testimony to Congress.

1451
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Now, I'm recording this video, this outro, on August 2025, so I believe it was late July, there was an image floating around Twitter and so forth in UFO circles of Castle pictured with Stephen Greer, Eric Burleson, Michael Herrera, and others.

1452
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And this is because after he reached out to David Grush, he decided to also reach out to Stephen Greer, and of course Stephen Greer brought him to Representative Burleson and so forth.

1453
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Now, I had, like I said, I had known about Mr. Castle long before then, before that image, before that trip, I just had not made the introduction to him, reached out to him, I was still in the process of researching his history and vetting him.

1454
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,000
We talk about that a little more in our full interview, but let's start to break things down.

1455
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Now, distinct thing here, a lot of people are trying to delineate between the term whistleblower and witness, and I think we did that in this video.

1456
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Mr. Castle isn't necessarily a whistleblower, but he is indeed a witness, and as we demonstrate in this video, what he witnessed is not as simple as seeing a craft.

1457
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:09,000
You know, there are plenty of stories from USMC vets, Army vets, Air Force vets, Navy vets who have seen Tic Tac craft, who have seen craft close to the bow of their ships and so forth.

1458
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:19,000
What Mr. Castle saw was what eye wager is an alien reproduction vehicle, an accompanying black team, the same sort of team that both Wagant and Herrera saw.

1459
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
This team armed in all black featured US Army helmets featured.

1460
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,000
You know, we try to tuck into the guns MP5 machine guns, not necessarily M16A4s or M4 carbines.

1461
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:39,000
The presence of an MP5 for all the gun fans out there would imply that this is possibly, you know, not a standard military unit as we saw.

1462
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:47,000
And one of the reasons why I led this was a PMC private military contractor SMU special mission unit out of Wackenhut.

1463
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And this is critical. These times are critical because this occurred mere weeks before the case of Wagant.

1464
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And one of the arguments I made that I had a lot of fun doing in this video was discussing, hey, maybe the way this team handled Castle,

1465
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:11,000
maybe after they handled Castle because we know hit the black ops team just ran down the hill, drove back northwest to the direction of Edwards at the direction of R-2508.

1466
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Right after that, the team brutalized Wagant, detained him.

1467
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:24,000
So I believe there might have been different sorts of safeguards put in place if the teams encountered blue units.

1468
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:33,000
And possibly this was exactly why the Navy tacked on to Hunter Warrior in the very end as an adjunct and put in some ARV teams.

1469
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Now, before we break things down, I know I put out a big thesis on there in my post video rant.

1470
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I never read from a script, but let me go ahead and reread the thesis from which I constructed most of my arguments.

1471
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
So we can have it all neatly recapped because I know we had an hour and 45 minutes.

1472
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:55,000
So let's just go through that. I'll tell you when I'm starting and I'll tell you what I'm ending starting for my work in theory.

1473
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:07,000
March 2nd to roughly March 14th, 1997 saw the execution of Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiments that involved the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, 29 Palms, California.

1474
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
The experiment was designed to examine three specific areas.

1475
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:17,000
The Center for Naval Analysis published summaries of the findings alongside the Marines by 1 August 1997.

1476
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Having previously expressed interest in carrier tactical aviation involvement in supporting troops offshore in 1995,

1477
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:31,000
a report titled An Operational Examination of Sea-Based Aerial Fire Support for Troops Engaged was written by the Navy.

1478
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
After recommendation of, and I'm going to skip over this guys because I know I read a little bit in the video,

1479
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,000
but of Navy Admiral J. Johnson to the Marine Corps Commanding General, the Navy Nautic,

1480
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
or what was previously known as the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada,

1481
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:55,000
assembled air crews alongside the Naval Air Station in the Moore, California to explore Hunter Air concepts during Hunter Warrior,

1482
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
which on the surface evaluated a wide variety of technologies and evolutionary tactics.

1483
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Involved naval experiments here, as we discussed, were considered adjunct, bolted on late in the planning stage.

1484
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Tying into Castle's encounter of the enormous floating triangle, an armed ground team,

1485
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Nautic and Nass, the Moore, engaged a Black Ops crash retrieval, or tactical team,

1486
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:26,000
or special mission unit, SMU, in war game exercises to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc.,

1487
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
alongside blue assets without detection, and obviously, due to Castle's encounter,

1488
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,000
this directive failed and failed miserably.

1489
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Rational here can be extended to and pause. I know this is controversial,

1490
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
but I did want to explore it because it is pretty intriguing to me,

1491
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
and I'd like to do a little more poking around because as I stated, I have heard that there are human tic-tacs

1492
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
and non-human tic-tacs, and I tend to agree with that sentiment.

1493
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm not staking my position or opinion in anywhere in the sand regarding Nimitz,

1494
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
but I thought this was interesting to explore, anyways, back to the thesis.

1495
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Rational can be extended to the 2004 Nimitz tic-tac encounter.

1496
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
If the tic-tac was indeed reverse-engineered technology from the Lockheed Skunk Works,

1497
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,000
operating in restricted, active US Navy airspace, this draws parallels to Castle's experience.

1498
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
As the tic-tac would have been conducting test missions, flights, etc. among blue assets,

1499
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
possibly to gauge blue responses to such vehicles or approaching cap points without detection

1500
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
or as little detection as possible.

1501
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Possible reason for this tic-tac testing on blue assets is to see reaction types,

1502
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
time, speeds, methods of an unknowing force if there was enemy contact.

1503
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Warning the pilots beforehand taints the results.

1504
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Quick pause, I'm not advocating for anything or making claims, I'm just exploring this concept.

1505
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,000
The Navy or other US entities would never test on their own pilots or servicemen,

1506
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
some people claim, well, this is wrong, it's done every day.

1507
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Further parallels to Castle involve the late March, early April experience

1508
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
of Lance Corporal Jonathan Waganth in the jungles of Peru.

1509
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
By Castle's description, there is a hypothesis that could be made.

1510
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Castle encountered the same type of team Waganth encountered training,

1511
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
working alongside blue assets without detection.

1512
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Of course, in both cases, such training failed.

1513
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Then this raises further questions.

1514
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:30,000
In Waganth's testimony, if the DOE Ness team he encountered that arrived via CH-47s

1515
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:37,000
was the team alongside the DOE Ness team, actually DOE SRT Wackenhut,

1516
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
and I do want to pause here, and you know what, let's just throw away the script, guys.

1517
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
This is the time we don't read from the script, so I do want to dive into Nautic and Nasslemore a little more.

1518
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
But, you know, when I was reading the terrorism industry book,

1519
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
and to learn more a little bit about the board of Wackenhut and some, you know,

1520
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:01,000
various chairman that they had, including Bobby Ray Inman, including Frank Harlucci,

1521
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
including Admiral William F. Raybourne,

1522
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I also saw in that book that in the late 80s, early 90s,

1523
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,000
that Wackenhut had established fobs or forward operating bases

1524
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
or places of business in specifically Peru.

1525
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,000
So now I really want to re-engage the idea that possibly DOE SRTs

1526
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
were the team that Waganth encountered as well.

1527
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:30,000
This SRTs are, I don't have any evidence or sources to back this up,

1528
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
but I am confident in that, in this hypothesis,

1529
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
that the DOE SRT privately trained and staffed by Wackenhut

1530
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
is what Castle encountered and now possibly Waganth.

1531
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And what strengthens this theory is the argument I made,

1532
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
such as DOE Nest and such as so much in DOE and NNSA,

1533
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
that the SRT team could fall back on the 1954 atomic energy agreement

1534
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
to basically obfuscate any mission, any retrieval,

1535
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
any operation they're doing, and this can be misclassified

1536
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
as transclassified for in nuclear materials.

1537
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So there is no need to divulge any information to any entity

1538
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
that does not have a strict need to know

1539
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
or is not on the bigot list of the associated CAP USAP

1540
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
or WAVED USAP.

1541
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Now, Nautic and Nassel Amour isn't that interesting.

1542
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I was so thrilled to build a thesis around this

1543
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
and being able to see that Nautic and Nassel Amour

1544
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
have their own sorts of triangle sightings.

1545
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
That was pretty intriguing to me.

1546
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
And then the tie-ins to Edwards.

1547
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Now, where were these craft stationed?

1548
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
There is an argument to be made that Nassel Amour held the craft,

1549
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
that Nautic held the craft, that Edwards held the craft,

1550
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
but I do think it is quite plausible.

1551
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And in my opinion, likely that this program operated

1552
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
between Navy and Air Force out of these three locations

1553
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
and possibly China Lake.

1554
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Fallon, Nevada is interesting as this is quite close to Area 51

1555
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
and the Fallon Test Range is quite close to the Nevada Test Range.

1556
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Anybody who's watched my videos and Jesse Michaels as well,

1557
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
hey, I'm rep at his merch.

1558
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
We'll know the story of Randy Anderson who claimed

1559
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
while doing test stops out at Area 51 Auxiliary sites

1560
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
on land owned by the Department of Energy,

1561
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
he himself has come across electric-ovidic triangle craft

1562
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
that the US hasn't stored.

1563
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Now, also near Fallon, Nevada,

1564
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Nautic is a Newark Keyport location

1565
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
that is supposedly a depot for underground mine storage.

1566
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Now, if you watched my, I think it was SAIC or US Navy video,

1567
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I talked about Newark Keyport as being almost a data acquisition type entity

1568
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
within US Navy legacy program operation.

1569
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
So that is something to chase down as well.

1570
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
As far as pilots here, we know that the triangle craft,

1571
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
if we're relegating this to TR3B,

1572
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
that according to Fouche that the pilots come out of the AFFTC,

1573
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center

1574
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
and the Air Force Test Pilot School out of Edwards,

1575
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
and we know from Ed, or at least I know from Ed,

1576
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
that this is indeed a place where I believe

1577
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:07,000
with extremely high certainty that elements of the 412th Test Wing

1578
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
and Edwards and likely various Air Force MRTFBs

1579
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
including the Utah Test and Training Range,

1580
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Nevada Test and Training Range collaborate to test flight ARV.

1581
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Now, I know what Fouche said,

1582
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
that these were test pilots from the Navy and Air Force

1583
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
and I know, guys, I know Nautic Top Gun is not a test pilot school,

1584
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
this is an active fighter school.

1585
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
The Navy's test pilot school is actually out at PAX River,

1586
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
which is interesting as well, that's another interesting connection.

1587
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
But quite intriguing that Castle's testimony,

1588
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
especially with a craft going Northwest

1589
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
and the team going Northwest into R-2508 airspace,

1590
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
ties into Edwards and Edwards Restricted Ranges

1591
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
when we also know that Nautic and National Moor had involvement as well.

1592
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
So, the reason I think this craft is an alien reproduction vehicle

1593
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
is because of the team associated that Castle encountered

1594
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
and because of just some of the characteristics of the craft.

1595
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I know that Kuzlowski and Phillips out of Arrow

1596
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
have begun recently talking about triangular craft

1597
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
and these being advanced human platforms and I do agree with that

1598
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
and I am still of the mind that some of these triangular craft

1599
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
are alien reproduction vehicles in the sense that

1600
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Fouche is right that their propulsion systems are based off of non-human technology

1601
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
or perhaps other aspects of their propulsion, their survivability,

1602
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
their mass reduction, their internal mass reduction,

1603
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
various aspects have been leveraged from non-human sources.

1604
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I think it is intriguing and I think that from Castle's description

1605
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
it sounds like what he saw was TR-3B.

1606
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Guys, I hope you appreciate those renders we have in this video.

1607
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I think they are wicked cool.

1608
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
But remember, Castle only saw the underside of the craft in part of the side

1609
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
so he did not see the top of the craft so we left the top blank.

1610
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
No features there, not like the TR-3B with the raised crew compartment in the middle

1611
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
because we do not know what was up there.

1612
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
What is interesting and what kind of takes me back to TR-3B

1613
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
is the concave section in the middle

1614
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
and if you actually look at Sal Paese's patents

1615
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
out of, not associated with, but out of Pax River,

1616
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I think this was in 2017 for inertial mass reduction craft,

1617
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
you'll see a triangle with a large concave center as well,

1618
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
interesting tie-in and of course Castle talks about the ridges

1619
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
in between the lights of the triangle

1620
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
and that reminds me closely of TR-3B as well.

1621
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
One of the things we have to pay attention to what Castle said

1622
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
is the lights on each vertex weren't just flush lights or recess lights,

1623
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
these almost seemed like orbs embedded in the triangle

1624
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and these gave off a whitish, yellowish, goldish color

1625
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
but did not cast light in the surrounding area.

1626
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
There's so much to chew through here guys,

1627
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
so much awesome stuff that relates to so much of what I've talked about

1628
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
on my channel and so much in UFO lore.

1629
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
So, I will be releasing the Castle interview soon,

1630
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
we talk a lot more, we talk about the anthrax vaccine,

1631
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
we talk about the other marines specifically

1632
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
because I know what you're thinking,

1633
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
there are multiple other marines with Castle

1634
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
and also behind the scenes we're trying to track down these marines

1635
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
to talk to them as well.

1636
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
You know, part of the issue with cases like Wageance

1637
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
and Michael Herreras is we can't necessarily pin down

1638
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
exactly where this event happened, you know, in Sumatra, Indonesia

1639
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
or in Wageance case, even if it was northern, southern Peru,

1640
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
if it relates to Bukalpa, where,

1641
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
but what is interesting here with Castle

1642
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:27,000
is we do know that within just a couple mile radius

1643
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
of Emerson Dry Lakebed, this is where this encounter happened

1644
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
and we know the exact direction in which the craft

1645
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
and the team departed.

1646
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
So, there's a lot more to true through

1647
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and a lot of interesting things to follow up on.

1648
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Again, that interview will come out soon.

1649
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I actually went out to where Mr. Castle lives,

1650
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
spent a couple days with him and we were courted out there.

1651
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So, wonderful things to say about the man,

1652
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
he's been all but gracious.

1653
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Same with other witnesses I've talked to,

1654
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
before we started talking, he was incredibly nervous,

1655
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
incredibly nervous.

1656
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
But we spent some time together, he started to open up

1657
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and the man was a joy to talk to

1658
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
and I hope to get him back in front of some congressmen.

1659
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I'd like to be there with him maybe

1660
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
and maybe we can present his testimony and this thesis together

1661
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
to maybe Rep Burleson or someone similar,

1662
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
but that is what I would like to do next.

1663
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Some bookkeeping stuff, guys.

1664
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
There's been a lot of buzz about the Danny Jones

1665
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
and Chris Ramsey podcasts.

1666
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Those have had an insane amount of views

1667
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
and it's a true honor that each of you guys

1668
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
watch that and support this channel.

1669
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
There's so many new viewers to this channel,

1670
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I think we've got almost 20,000 from those two interviews.

1671
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
So, if you're new to this channel, I love you.

1672
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
If you are a longtime viewer of this channel,

1673
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I also love you.

1674
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
In the comments all the time, I see so many people

1675
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
that have been with me leaving comments since day one,

1676
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
since I had 20 subscribers, 30 subscribers,

1677
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
names that come to mind.

1678
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Mighty Mo, Tanner Johnson, Birdie606.

1679
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
So, a lot of you guys I recognize

1680
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and I appreciate each and every one of you.

1681
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Remember, I do have a Patreon.

1682
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I would love if you support the channel.

1683
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
That's how I fund these trips.

1684
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
That's how I fund the 3D designers

1685
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
and that's how I keep my channel going.

1686
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I don't gatekeep content,

1687
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
so please just support what you think the channel is worth.

1688
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Your support means the absolute world to me

1689
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
and if you don't want to support on Patreon,

1690
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
at least give this video a like, a comment,

1691
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
and subscribe to the channel.

1692
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I think every YouTuber says this,

1693
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
but it actually does help quite a bit.

1694
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
But I appreciate everybody being here

1695
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
and if you watch the end here, thank you so much.

1696
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I got some exciting stuff coming down the corners.

1697
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
We got some hearings coming up in September.

1698
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I think we have a date for that.

1699
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I will be there for that

1700
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
and I know I haven't done it in a long time,

1701
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
but I think I will do a live stream before

1702
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
and after the hearings

1703
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
and I will be there for a lot of fun.

1704
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I will be boots on the ground for that.

1705
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Remember, I got a Patreon support the channel.

1706
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Like and subscribe.

1707
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I will catch everybody on the next episode.

1708
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I'm trying to think if there is anything else I missed.

1709
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Yes, there is.

1710
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Randy Anderson talked about Area 51

1711
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
and seeing triangles there.

1712
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I also have my friend, the Army Public Affairs Officer,

1713
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
who was at Area 51 at Groom Lake

1714
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
who on the cleared flight line

1715
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
when he was with some active colonels there,

1716
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
saw a triangle take off vertically

1717
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
at incomprehensible speeds,

1718
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
making no sounds, not disturbing any of the dust around it.

1719
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I think I talked about that on Danny Jones,

1720
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
but I just remember that now.

1721
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
We will wrap that up today.

1722
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I think we are approaching on two hours.

1723
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
With that being said, guys,

1724
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
thank you everybody for joining me

1725
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
and thank you for supporting Mr. Castle.

1726
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I will link his Twitter down below.

1727
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
He is a great guy.

1728
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Feel free to talk to him.

1729
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I appreciate his courage coming out

1730
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
and thank you so much for watching.

1731
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Catch everybody next time. Bye.
