0	7000	We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty, you know, on 12-hour shifts.
7000	12000	Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7pm to 7am.
12000	18000	And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee,
18000	21000	probably in chairs or hanging out in the back.
21000	27000	We get a call on the radio that there's, you know, either unexplained
27000	32000	or unauthorized something about flare activity in the desert.
32000	37000	You know, maybe four, three to four miles out, maybe five.
37000	42000	We come over a hill, we're yanking the trailer behind us, you know,
42000	45000	maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour.
45000	51000	We come over a hill and all five of us see it.
51000	59000	It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle,
59000	66000	meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner.
66000	72000	And possibly some kind of venting on the sides,
72000	76000	but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy.
76000	78000	That was there hanging in the sky.
78000	82000	I say hanging because there was enough wind for something even, you know,
82000	86000	I know aerodynamics, something that if it was thin enough,
86000	89000	maybe it could hover slightly.
89000	93000	So this is what it would look like if you were looking straight up at it.
93000	97000	Of course, that's not the angle, it was more, you know,
97000	98000	I don't want to use that.
98000	103000	A soup bowl going forward with no light emitting from here,
103000	110000	yellow, yellowish, whiteish,
110000	118000	or kind of like a ball sphere had been embedded into the underside.
118000	125000	Accompanying it, we're about 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms
125000	132000	and five to six can't remember exactly vehicles.
132000	142000	Look like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks jacked up all black, all matte,
142000	146000	some with canopies, some with antennas.
146000	148000	This is all coming in a flash, right?
148000	151000	Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill.
151000	155000	The minute we came up over about half of them,
155000	159000	maybe 15 came running up the hill towards us,
160000	163000	V-formations with guns.
163000	168000	Yeah, right up harsh language.
168000	171000	Get your f***ing heads down, get your f***ing heads down.
171000	174000	Get your f***ing heads down.
174000	176000	You know, not shooting.
176000	177000	But looking like they're ready to.
177000	183000	You know, very close to our heads as if they didn't want us to look at anything.
183000	187000	We felt, my initial reaction was we f***ed up,
187000	190000	found something that we shouldn't be involved in
190000	195000	and I'm just going to comply because I'm scared.
195000	199000	On this channel, I investigate UFO whistleblowers,
199000	201000	UFO crash retrieval cases,
201000	206000	and UFO legacy program operations that exist somewhere between elements
206000	208000	of the United States Department of Defense,
208000	211000	intelligence communities, colossal defense contractors,
211000	214000	and semi-private R&D experts called
214000	217000	Federally-funded research and development centers.
217000	220000	One of my personal favorite topics to study
220000	223000	is the concept of alien reproduction vehicles.
223000	228000	Human-made aerospace vehicles that range from replicas of non-human craft
228000	230000	to prosaic airframes and designs
230000	234000	employing one or more aspects of non-human technologies.
234000	238000	The term ARV was coined by the now infamous Brad S,
238000	243000	an industrial designer who witnessed three man-made flying saucer vehicles
243000	248000	called quote-unquote flux liners at a classified section of the 1988
248000	250000	Norton Air Force Base Air Show,
250000	253000	which were described as copycat vehicles
253000	257000	employing highly exotic propulsion systems and craft designs,
257000	262000	while still featuring F-4 Phantom jump seats and sloped-on paint.
262000	264000	As recently as 2024,
264000	268000	whistleblower Matthew Brown proposed the Immaculate Constellation Reports,
268000	271000	which detailed a special access program
271000	274000	targeted with performing data acquisition of video,
274000	276000	satellite imagery, etc.,
276000	280000	on UFOs and quote-unquote reproduction vehicles.
280000	283000	Such cases involved reproduction vehicles
283000	286000	detailed as silent, enormous black triangles
286000	291000	observed by U.S. Indo-Paccom, or U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.
291000	295000	I have discussed numerous cases surrounding alien reproduction vehicles,
295000	299000	including the ever-complex and awe-inspiring flux liner,
299000	301000	the whistleblower testimony of Ed,
301000	304000	who served as an electronics warfare detector
304000	306000	at the Edwards 412 test wing,
306000	310000	where he claimed he served as the mediary between scientists
310000	314000	and test pilots of reverse-engineered UFO craft.
314000	317000	And I have devoted an entire documentary
317000	321000	to exploring man-made reproduction vehicle triangular craft.
321000	323000	In this project in question,
323000	327000	I argued why I believe many, perhaps not all,
327000	331000	but many triangular UFO sightings are in fact man-made vehicles
331000	335000	that harness exotic technologies and concepts.
335000	339000	Specific craft covered were seemingly prototype iterations of triangles
339000	344000	with varying features seen worldwide from the 1970s to 1990s.
344000	348000	Crescendoing in the 1989 Belgian Triangle UFO wave,
348000	351000	as well as the XF-131 Super Sentinel,
351000	356000	which famously made its way onto the X-Files Season 1, Episode 1.
356000	362000	This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.
362000	366000	Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out.
366000	369000	Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now,
369000	373000	the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map,
373000	377000	is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.
377000	381000	Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs?
381000	385000	No. Planes built using UFO technology.
385000	389000	After forensic artist Bill McDonald drew the copycat vehicle
389000	392000	in a Denny's in Antelope Valley in 1992.
392000	396000	Based upon the first-hand testimony from four engineers,
396000	400000	two from Lockheed out of the Hellendale radar cross-section plans
400000	404000	and two from Northrop Grumman out of the Tejon radar cross-section plans.
404000	410000	The most famous mention of reverse-engineered craft came from Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet,
410000	414000	who detailed the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B.
414000	419000	The pride of U.S. Aerospace, whose propulsion system was reverse-engineered by Sandia
419000	422000	in Lawrence Livermore National Labs.
422000	425000	Two federally funded research and development centers,
425000	429000	whose pilots hailed from the U.S. Navy and Edwards 412 Test Wing,
430000	435000	whose engineering was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne Ryan,
435000	441000	and whose program was managed by three of six of the U.S. Big Six intelligence agencies,
441000	445000	the NRO, NSA, and CIA.
445000	450000	But today, I am thrilled to announce I have sat down with a first-hand UFO witness
450000	454000	who since he first approached David Grush in early 2025
454000	458000	is dead set on swearing his testimony before Congress.
458000	464000	A former U.S. Marine whose testimony ties into this entire long-winded intro
464000	467000	as well as other whistleblower testimonies I have covered,
467000	474000	specifically Ed from the Edwards 412 Test Wing and U.S. Marines Jonathan Waganth and Michael Herrera.
474000	482000	Meet Roderick Castle III, a veteran and sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 to 1999,
482000	486000	who now works with veterans suffering from PTSD.
486000	490000	Castle served with the VMA-513, the Flying Nightmares,
490000	496000	an AV-8B Harrier Squadron stationed out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona,
496000	503000	leading a team of six to eight Marines in aviation ordinance while also training as a helicopter flight medic.
503000	509000	I have recorded an entire interview with Castle detailing his harrowing experience
509000	517000	of what I wager is a triangular ARV, an accompanying black operation's unacknowledged Special Mission Unit
517000	523000	encountered a little too close for comfort here in the continental United States.
523000	526000	Viewers of my channel know me and know who I am,
526000	530000	so a week before the interview with Castle releases,
530000	534000	we will today exhaustively explore his testimony
534000	540000	in place the who, what, when, where, and why to his harrowing encounter.
540000	546000	To some, Castle's testimony may seem simple and quite similar to that of Waganth and Herrera.
546000	552000	While on duty, a Marine encounters an all-black team with advanced gear and weaponry,
552000	555000	featuring no insignia or identification,
555000	562000	there might be a craft-defying all-logic hovering motionless nearby seemingly operated by humans,
562000	567000	but the Marine is forcibly detained, threatened, and met with reprisals.
567000	576000	But to me, Castle's brief but powerful testimony offers us an unparalleled look into U.S. legacy program operations,
576000	583000	how these UFO paramilitary groups operate alongside other blue, a.k.a. friendly assets,
583000	588000	and a greater understanding that the U.S. does indeed employ triangular craft
588000	593000	that can defy all logic for clandestine aerospace applications.
593000	596000	So please look at this video as a part one of two,
596000	601000	the investigation of Castle should not be viewed without the interview of Castle.
601000	605000	With all that out of the way, let's dive in, but last thing here,
605000	610000	I know some viewers of my work can get tripped up with so many uses of acronyms.
610000	613000	So guys, today we are diving into military programs,
613000	617000	so please expect a tremendous amount of acronyms.
617000	621000	I will try to relist all acronyms used in the video description,
621000	624000	so please reference there if you get tripped up,
624000	627000	but with that out of the way, let's begin.
641000	654000	Roderick John Castle III entered into service at the United States Marine Corps in 1994,
654000	658000	and by his retirement, Castle earned the rank of Sergeant, or an E-5.
658000	665000	Castle's primary MOS, or Military Occupational Specialty, was a 6531.
665000	670000	Her aircraft ordinance technician, Castle served at the MAG-13,
670000	673000	or Marine Aircraft Control Group 13,
673000	677000	of the 3D MAW, or Third Marine Aircraft Wing,
677000	682000	stationed at MCAS Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma,
682000	685000	and yes, I know, we're already getting into the acronyms.
685000	690000	Now real fast, I previously discussed Yuma Proving Ground,
690000	694000	or US Army MRTFB, or Major Range and Test Facility Base
694000	698000	in regards to UFO Legacy Program Operations.
698000	702000	23 US MRTFBs exist,
702000	706000	8 Army, 6 Navy, 7 Air Force, and 2 Defense Agency.
706000	709000	These include Edwards 412 Test Wing,
709000	711000	NAWC Patuxent River,
711000	714000	and the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Command,
714000	718000	Fort Wachuka, and the West Desert Test Center, and more.
718000	722000	One of my prevailing and prominent theories regarding UFO Legacy Programs
722000	726000	is the usage of these critical core MRTFBs
726000	729000	for UFO research, development, tests, and evaluation.
729000	732000	This includes everything from craft storage,
732000	736000	accompanying deep underground military bases beneath MRTFBs,
736000	740000	and utilization of restricted airspace for test flight
740000	743000	of recovered or reverse engineered craft.
743000	748000	MCAS, out of which CASEL operated, is not part of Yuma Proving Ground,
748000	751000	therefore it is not part of the MRTFB.
751000	757000	In fact, while CASEL's experience involved a coordinated US Marine Corps experiment,
757000	761000	I wager the USMC is quite unlikely to run and operate
761000	764000	UFO Legacy Program Operations,
764000	767000	and keep this in mind as we progress in our investigation.
767000	771000	While I can present ample testimony, evidence, files, and research
771000	774000	that the US Army, Air Force, and Navy
774000	781000	operate siloed UFO Legacy Programs in conjunction with the US Big Six Intelligence Agencies,
781000	788000	I can find no such evidence even suggesting USMC engages with the UFO portfolio.
788000	793000	CASEL served with the VMA-513, nicknamed the Flying Nightmares,
793000	799000	a USMC attack squadron known for use of its AV-8B Harrier jets.
799000	804000	And towards the tail end of its service trained as a helicopter flight medic.
804000	807000	Harriers are fascinating pieces of technology.
807000	812000	These intriguing craft are known as VTOL, Vertical Takeoff and Landing Jets,
812000	819000	while the AV-8B Harriers are known as STOVL, Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing,
819000	825000	meaning that Harriers require little to no runway to take off and can actually land vertically.
825000	829000	And this means Harrier jets can stand still and hover in the air,
829000	834000	thanks to their Rolls-Royce Pegasus engines equipped with four rotating nozzles
834000	838000	that can direct engine thrust quite the sight for an attack jet.
838000	844000	But I mention this due to CASEL's familiarity with both Harrier jets and helicopters.
844000	850000	He was well accustomed to VTOL and STOVL technology, helicopter morphology,
850000	853000	and Harrier standstill flight vectoring and dynamics.
853000	859000	In 1997, CASEL would take part in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,
859000	865000	a 12-day experiment that ran from the 2nd of May 1997 to 14 May 1997
865000	871000	in Southern California out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms.
871000	875000	The Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment was at the time
875000	881000	the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory,
881000	887000	which explored methods to increase the area of influence and combat effectiveness of Marine units
887000	893000	by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques.
893000	897000	The Hunter Warrior Experiment operated with three primary objectives.
897000	899000	One, quote,
899000	905000	The first objective area covers tactical operations on the dispersed, non-contiguous battlefield.
905000	913000	How small units perform against a numerically superior force on a battlefield that has no front, flank, or rear areas,
913000	916000	and is key component of this objective, end quote.
916000	918000	Two, quote,
918000	924000	The second area is command control communication computers and intelligence, and the single battle concept.
924000	930000	Creating and using a shared digital communications network will be crucial in many different areas.
930000	936000	Experiments in C4I examine the digital network in information sharing, end quote.
936000	938000	And finally, three, quote,
938000	942000	The third objective is enhancing fire support and improving targeting
942000	945000	to dominate the broad dispersed battlefield of the future,
945000	951000	effective and efficient use of all indirect fire is absolutely necessary, end quote.
951000	955000	During Hunter Warrior's Advanced Warfighting Experiment's operations,
955000	962000	and within Hunter Warrior's AO, or area of operations, is where CASEL's experience took place.
962000	970000	Now, if you recall in 2023, Jeremy Corbell released a video of a supposed triangle UFO over 29 palms.
970000	975000	Arguments persist to this day if the video depicts a craft or a group of flares,
975000	980000	but that and 29 palms are not relevant to our investigation today.
980000	986000	Indeed, I believe many studying CASEL's testimony would look for evidence of UFO Legacy Program operations
986000	991000	out of 29 palms Marine Station, but I vehemently disagree.
991000	995000	I believe that by studying the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,
995000	1001000	we can truly gain unparalleled insights into UFO Legacy Program's conduct,
1001000	1005000	testing, and training missions on U.S. soil.
1005000	1008000	Hang tight because after we detail CASEL's encounter,
1008000	1015000	we will spend a significant amount of time exploring the 1997 Hunter Warrior Experiment.
1021000	1030000	We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty on 12-hour shifts.
1030000	1037000	Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
1037000	1043000	And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee,
1043000	1046000	probably in chairs or hanging out in the back.
1046000	1054000	We get a call on the radio that there's either unexplained or unauthorized
1054000	1057000	something about flare activity in the desert.
1057000	1062000	Maybe 3 to 4 miles out, maybe 5.
1062000	1069000	This is the part that gets a little sketchy, but I've tried to find it on maps.
1072000	1077000	We come over a hill or yank in the trailer behind us,
1077000	1080000	maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour.
1080000	1086000	We come over a hill and all five of us see it.
1086000	1094000	It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle,
1094000	1101000	meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner.
1101000	1107000	And possibly some kind of venting on the sides,
1107000	1111000	but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy.
1111000	1114000	That was there hanging in the sky.
1117000	1127000	So accompanying it were about 30, 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms.
1127000	1134000	And 5 to 6 can't remember exactly vehicles.
1134000	1144000	It looked like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks, jacked up, all black, all matte.
1144000	1148000	Some with canopies, some with antennas.
1148000	1150000	This is all coming in a flash, right?
1150000	1153000	Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill.
1156000	1159000	Enough to notice that the thing was hanging there.
1159000	1164000	Enough to notice it was slightly turning counterclockwise.
1166000	1171000	Perhaps there was some indentation in the center,
1171000	1175000	maybe some type of striation or venting on the side,
1175000	1183000	but these are impressions that I've had to find
1183000	1188000	and integrate with that initial shock and awe of seeing something like this.
1188000	1193000	During the 2nd of March 1997 to the 14th of March 1997,
1193000	1196000	Roderick Castle with his team of 5 to 6 other Marines
1196000	1199000	and the VMA 513 flying nightmares
1199000	1203000	engaged in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting experiment
1203000	1207000	out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms,
1207000	1210000	located in the Southern California desert.
1210000	1213000	Castle and his fellow team operated attached
1213000	1217000	to an experimental Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.
1217000	1219000	Ironically to this channel,
1219000	1222000	Castle and his fellow Marines participated in the experiment
1222000	1225000	as a Harrier jet crash retrieval team.
1225000	1228000	One night during the 12 day operation,
1228000	1230000	Castle and his team were engaged
1230000	1233000	in overnight crash retrieval duties for Harriers.
1233000	1235000	The Marines were sent in to investigate
1235000	1237000	unidentified flare activity.
1237000	1239000	As you will see in our interview,
1239000	1242000	Castle and I have worked hard to trace almost exactly
1242000	1246000	where this incident took place to reduce as much ambiguity
1246000	1249000	and questions as possible.
1249000	1252000	Our incident occurred within a 7.5 mile radius
1252000	1254000	of Emerson Dry Lakebed,
1254000	1256000	northwest of 29 Palms
1256000	1259000	in about 90 miles southeast of Edwards Air Force Base
1259000	1261000	in the Antelope Valley.
1261000	1262000	If you know my work,
1262000	1264000	my bet you can already guess
1264000	1267000	where we will be going in our investigation.
1267000	1269000	Castle and his Marines came over a hill
1269000	1271000	heading northwest in this area
1271000	1273000	and we can find multiple dirt roads
1273000	1277000	with varying terrain near the Emerson Dry Lakebed.
1277000	1279000	According to the Federal Aviation Administration's
1279000	1281000	special use of airspace,
1281000	1285000	this event occurred within R2501C.
1285000	1288000	I strongly recommend committing this piece of airspace to memory
1288000	1290000	as regular old boring discussion
1290000	1293000	of air traffic organizational policy
1293000	1295000	and restricted pieces of airspace
1295000	1298000	will become paramount to our investigation.
1298000	1300000	So this is what it would look like
1300000	1302000	if you were looking straight up at it.
1302000	1304000	Of course, that's not the angle.
1304000	1306000	If it's more, you know,
1306000	1308000	I want to use that.
1308000	1309000	So you only saw the underside of this, right?
1309000	1310000	Yeah.
1310000	1312000	You cannot speak to what the top would like.
1312000	1313000	I'm going to do this faintly
1313000	1316000	because there's perhaps convex, right?
1316000	1317000	Going inward.
1317000	1319000	Is that what I said before?
1319000	1320000	Or concave.
1320000	1321000	Concave, yes.
1321000	1322000	Same.
1322000	1324000	A soup bowl going forward,
1324000	1326000	but no light emitting from here,
1326000	1329000	but a yellow,
1329000	1333000	a yellowish, whiteish
1333000	1337000	or kind of light.
1337000	1340000	You know, nothing crazy, like psychedelic or
1340000	1343000	but definitely like a ball,
1343000	1347000	a sphere had been embedded into the underside.
1347000	1348000	And that's important you say that, right?
1348000	1350000	It's not just like a flush LED light.
1350000	1352000	It's not like spheres embedded into each corner.
1352000	1356000	Yeah, and the light was
1356000	1358000	deeper than an incandescent or an LED.
1358000	1360000	One of the things you told me when we were talking
1360000	1362000	and this, the light cast,
1362000	1366000	didn't cast onto the ground
1366000	1368000	or the team or anything.
1368000	1369000	The light wasn't cast.
1369000	1372000	You know, not completely non-reflective,
1372000	1374000	which it would be, you know,
1374000	1378000	invisible basically, but
1378000	1381000	all this aspect, very black,
1381000	1383000	blocking out the sky and the stars.
1383000	1387000	You get that deep dark blue
1387000	1389000	in the desert sometimes.
1389000	1390000	The moon was not,
1390000	1392000	I don't know where the moon was that night.
1392000	1394000	It must have been over one of the hills.
1394000	1396000	Coming over the hill in a Humvee,
1396000	1398000	carrying fire suppression equipment,
1398000	1400000	the Marines encountered an enormous,
1400000	1403000	equilateral triangular craft
1403000	1406000	that measured approximately 300 feet in length,
1406000	1410000	hovering silently 150 to 200 feet in the air.
1410000	1413000	The craft emitted no detectable sound,
1413000	1415000	featured no exhaust ports,
1415000	1418000	bolts, seams, or rivets.
1418000	1420000	An unlike a Harrier or helicopter
1420000	1422000	sat stationless in the air,
1422000	1425000	no wobbling, bobbling, or weaving,
1425000	1427000	and featured no exhaust signs
1427000	1429000	like one would see from a Harrier's
1429000	1431000	VTOL thrust engines.
1431000	1434000	The ominous vehicle was matte black or darker
1434000	1436000	with no observable reflectivity
1436000	1439000	and featured three lights at each corner,
1439000	1441000	bright lights, but not blinding.
1441000	1443000	The lights were a combination of yellow,
1443000	1445000	white, and gold,
1445000	1448000	but oddly cast no shadow onto the ground.
1448000	1450000	Below the craft,
1450000	1454000	an estimated 150 to 200 feet away from the castle
1454000	1457000	were unmarked black tactical vehicles
1457000	1459000	and an accompanying unit
1459000	1461000	of approximately 30 armed men
1461000	1464000	in unmarked black uniforms.
1464000	1466000	Like the stories of Wagan and Herrera,
1466000	1468000	these men bore no insignia,
1468000	1471000	identifiable markings, flags, or name tags,
1471000	1475000	and the operators all spoke with American dialects.
1475000	1478000	The vehicles seemed to be all Ford F-150
1478000	1482000	to F-350 types with all black canopies.
1482000	1485000	Some featured antennae on top of the canopy,
1485000	1488000	but all vehicles were all black.
1488000	1490000	No logos, symbols, chrome,
1490000	1492000	or metallic reflections were visible
1492000	1494000	off of any of the automobiles.
1494000	1496000	Despite Castle and his fellow
1496000	1499000	VMA-513 Marines operating in uniform
1499000	1502000	with authority on U.S. soil,
1502000	1504000	half of the unmarked operators
1504000	1506000	intercepted the Marines at gunpoint.
1506000	1508000	The Marines were disarmed, held at gunpoint,
1508000	1511000	and threatened and ordered to stay silent.
1511000	1514000	You know, so we're alert, but we're, you know,
1514000	1516000	we're, of course, tired,
1516000	1518000	but we don't have night vision stuff.
1518000	1520000	This is low-tech, you know,
1520000	1523000	we're Marines and we've been through combat training,
1523000	1525000	but we're glorified mechanics,
1525000	1528000	so we know we're technicians.
1528000	1530000	So there's a handful of tactical vehicles,
1530000	1532000	all black, and a team of about 30.
1532000	1534000	What was the team doing?
1534000	1537000	Not enough time to even evaluate that,
1537000	1540000	because the minute we came up over
1540000	1542000	about half of them, maybe 15,
1542000	1545000	came running up the hill towards us,
1545000	1549000	and V formations with guns.
1549000	1551000	What were they armed with?
1551000	1554000	Subtype of, like, subtype machine gun.
1554000	1557000	I'm not a guy who knows all the guns,
1557000	1561000	but I did, I am an artist,
1561000	1565000	and I have found a way to use AI
1565000	1567000	to help me with this process.
1567000	1569000	I did send you a picture at one point,
1569000	1571000	and maybe that could be shown.
1571000	1573000	That's exactly what they look like.
1573000	1575000	Other than maybe, you know,
1575000	1579000	my picture ends up with a Caucasian skin tone at the top.
1579000	1582000	Not necessarily the case,
1582000	1587000	but that's the only place any type of skin
1587000	1589000	for any of these men might have been shown.
1589000	1591000	We'll show it on screen,
1591000	1593000	because of course we're working with that 3D artist
1593000	1595000	to recreate the scene,
1595000	1597000	and to your specific specifications.
1597000	1600000	So you're saying all black army helmets,
1600000	1603000	sometimes goggles, black,
1603000	1605000	what looks almost like a ski mask,
1605000	1607000	black fatigues, black tactical gear,
1607000	1608000	submachine gun.
1608000	1610000	Yeah, like, you know,
1610000	1613000	classic black clad mercenary type.
1613000	1615000	You know, again, I'm an artist,
1615000	1618000	so I'm going to see things through a lens,
1618000	1622000	sometimes through art and movies and comics,
1622000	1625000	and these were, if you want to,
1625000	1628000	you want to drop some evil villains
1628000	1630000	and, you know, black clad mercenaries,
1630000	1631000	this is what these guys look like.
1631000	1636000	Yeah, right up harsh language.
1637000	1639000	Get your ass down, get your ass down.
1639000	1641000	Get your ass down.
1641000	1643000	You know, not shooting,
1643000	1645000	but looking like they're ready to.
1645000	1647000	You know, very close to our heads,
1647000	1651000	as if they didn't want us to look at anything.
1651000	1654000	We felt, my initial reaction was,
1654000	1656000	we f***ed up, we came upon something
1656000	1659000	that we shouldn't be involved in,
1659000	1661000	and I'm just going to comply,
1661000	1663000	because I'm scared.
1663000	1665000	You know, like again, we're Marines,
1665000	1666000	we're technicians,
1666000	1669000	and our M16s are in the back of the truck,
1669000	1670000	you know, in Iraq.
1670000	1671000	Right.
1671000	1672000	You guys are there for our suppression.
1672000	1673000	Not even loaded.
1673000	1675000	We don't have magazines on it.
1675000	1677000	We're carrying two bells.
1677000	1678000	Because you were, you know,
1678000	1679000	for the exercise,
1679000	1681000	harrier, crash or triple duty if needed.
1681000	1685000	You're not there to be armed or station.
1685000	1688000	No, no, you know, we fight if we need to fight,
1688000	1690000	but that's not our primary job.
1690000	1692000	So these guys are harsh language head down,
1692000	1694000	they don't want you to see anything.
1694000	1696000	So, and keep in mind this whole thing,
1696000	1700000	max four minutes, maybe three.
1700000	1702000	That's what I want people to know too,
1702000	1706000	is this was, this is a flash,
1706000	1711000	adrenaline filled witness event.
1711000	1716000	You know, this is something I came across accidentally.
1716000	1722000	And I see it now as some very positive,
1722000	1723000	mostly positive thing,
1723000	1725000	that, you know, it opened up some,
1725000	1726000	some avenues for me,
1726000	1729000	but as far as thinking,
1729000	1735000	but something I probably would have,
1735000	1736000	if things hadn't changed,
1736000	1738000	maybe, you know, in the last two, three years,
1738000	1741000	with the energy about this subject,
1741000	1743000	the stigma I probably would have just taken
1743000	1744000	to my grave.
1744000	1747000	You know, maybe told stories to excite,
1747000	1749000	you know, my grandkids or something.
1749000	1752000	Oh, Grandpa Roder's talking about that black triangle again.
1752000	1755000	That was the first demands, you know, out of the vehicle.
1755000	1757000	Out of the, out, out, out, out.
1757000	1763000	Minimum language, which tells you they mean business.
1763000	1765000	And I don't know how else to say it,
1765000	1768000	but anybody that's been there knows what it feels like
1768000	1772000	when you know for certain,
1772000	1776000	this guy's probably this close from shooting you in the head.
1776000	1781000	It's a feeling, it's a real thing that all the acid
1781000	1784000	in your stomach just floods you, you know,
1784000	1786000	you're flood, you're ready to die.
1786000	1787000	Yeah.
1787000	1791000	So, this was all happening at the same time,
1791000	1792000	in multiple ways,
1792000	1795000	because we all are affected by that trauma differently.
1795000	1799000	So me, I might freeze,
1799000	1802000	because I'm starting to conceptualize the whole situation.
1802000	1804000	My other guy might get aggressive.
1804000	1806000	Another guy might run.
1806000	1809000	Did these guys, did they have any insignia,
1809000	1811000	any name tags, any claims?
1811000	1814000	No, no, it's like completely black.
1814000	1817000	On purpose, obvious.
1817000	1820000	You know, every truck was painted matte black.
1820000	1822000	But they spoke with American dialect, right?
1822000	1824000	The few that I could, that I heard.
1824000	1825000	The Puss Watson.
1825000	1827000	And they were very, they knew what they were doing,
1827000	1831000	because they knew certain guys talk,
1831000	1834000	certain guys don't, the rest, keep their mouth shut.
1834000	1838000	So I know that your number one concern was for your life
1838000	1839000	and the life of your fellow Marines.
1839000	1842000	Could you tell what the rest of the convoy was doing,
1842000	1843000	what the trucks were doing,
1843000	1845000	what the Triangle was doing during this time?
1845000	1846000	You know, of course, I've gone over this
1846000	1847000	in my head a billion times.
1847000	1850000	I got my, my kind of theories,
1850000	1852000	but I'm not stuck on anything.
1852000	1856000	It felt more like they were there with it.
1856000	1858000	It's some kind of overwatch.
1858000	1861000	Maybe it was, why I was hovering right there, I don't know.
1861000	1863000	After approximately two minutes,
1863000	1865000	since first observing the craft,
1865000	1867000	and whilst being detained by the operators,
1867000	1871000	the Triangle ceased its slow rotation counterclockwise,
1871000	1874000	climbed at an angle and darted to the Northwest
1874000	1877000	at an extremely high rate of speed.
1877000	1878000	And remember that direction.
1878000	1883000	But again, this craft took off with no visible auditory
1883000	1886000	or optical signs of propulsion or thrust.
1886000	1893000	I did see it zoom to the Northwest,
1893000	1896000	which is the direction, the general direction of the road
1896000	1899000	at a very high rate of speed.
1899000	1903000	Again, no, no noise, no exhaust, nothing.
1903000	1905000	Just slow descent.
1905000	1908000	So it, it rose up a little bit and then just darted?
1908000	1910000	Yeah, like at an angle, at an angle.
1910000	1913000	Did it curve or did it seem like the,
1913000	1915000	the craft would be parallel to the ground?
1915000	1916000	No, yes.
1916000	1918000	That's important, you know.
1918000	1921000	Staying, staying like this.
1921000	1924000	So it didn't turn at an angle, just rose up?
1924000	1927000	Yeah, like it's on some kind of,
1927000	1929000	it needs to stay that direction.
1929000	1931000	Did it seem like there was visible acceleration
1931000	1933000	or did this just?
1933000	1936000	At first it was like a, like maybe a slow buildup,
1936000	1940000	that angle, and then when it hit that, to nothing.
1940000	1941000	Wow.
1941000	1944000	Like a very tiny light to nothing, but you know.
1944000	1947000	And that's what resonates with other reports I've heard.
1947000	1950000	It's just this rapid, rapid acceleration.
1950000	1954000	The craft disappeared almost instantaneously and quickly.
1954000	1957000	The black operators sprinted back down the hill,
1957000	1960000	boarded their tactical vehicles and drove off to the northwest
1960000	1962000	at a high rate of speed.
1962000	1964000	In a state of psychological shock,
1964000	1967000	the men tried and failed to start their humvees.
1967000	1970000	The vehicles remained inoperable for several minutes.
1970000	1975000	They, they seem surprised as we were, but they were ready.
1975000	1977000	Cause that's what they do.
1977000	1979000	That was the sense they're doing their job.
1979000	1981000	The minutes the thing was gone.
1981000	1984000	They've run back down the hill, back to their vehicles.
1984000	1987000	They take off down that road.
1987000	1990000	Same direction as a craft.
1990000	1993000	We pick ourselves up.
1993000	1996000	We're the only best way I can explain is state of shock
1996000	1999000	after a car accident or something.
1999000	2002000	The one younger guy who was, you know, always,
2002000	2004000	the one that talked the most, you know, he said,
2004000	2006000	you know, what's.
2006000	2009000	You know, I remember that distinctly.
2009000	2011000	It's like those first few moments after a car crash,
2011000	2013000	that something gets embedded.
2013000	2018000	Um, got back in the vehicle, attempted to turn the humvee on.
2018000	2021000	It would not start at first.
2021000	2024000	Um, relatively rare.
2024000	2029000	Um, you know, you got a, just a side switch to diesel engine.
2029000	2030000	Pretty reliable.
2030000	2033000	It took maybe five minutes to get it going
2033000	2035000	and try it every minute.
2035000	2038000	I am reminded here of Dr. Kevin Knuth
2038000	2040000	at the 2023 Soul Foundation,
2040000	2045000	where he discussed vehicle malfunctions in the presence of UFOs.
2045000	2050000	You might recall the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind,
2050000	2054000	where Richard Dreyfus is in his truck investigating power outages
2054000	2058000	and the UFO flies over his truck and the truck stops running.
2058000	2065000	Um, McCamble in 1983 had identified several automobile interference types.
2065000	2068000	You get engine disruption and failure.
2068000	2073000	The engines sometimes fail to restart in the vicinity of a UFO.
2073000	2080000	And when the UFO leaves, sometimes the engine restarts.
2080000	2085000	When I saw that in the movie, I was like, oh, this is just silly at this point.
2085000	2086000	Oh, just restart.
2086000	2090000	You can't just, how is the UFO magically restarting the engine?
2090000	2095000	Um, well, if you think about the physics, you can reason through this.
2095000	2101000	And this is what McCamble had done.
2101000	2104000	If you have a strong enough electric field around this UFO,
2104000	2107000	you could possibly be ionizing the air.
2107000	2109000	How strong is this field got to be?
2109000	2114000	It's got to be on the order of three times ten to the six volts per meter.
2114000	2118000	That'll short out the spark plugs in the car.
2118000	2123000	It'll short out the distributor cam so the car will stop running.
2123000	2125000	But this also brings up an interesting point.
2125000	2129000	If the VMA-513 Marines experienced vehicle failure,
2129000	2133000	this would imply the black operators and their ground tactical vehicles
2133000	2135000	were equipped with countermeasures,
2135000	2138000	maybe similar to something like a Faraday cage
2138000	2142000	to deflect the electromagnetic interference produced by the triangle,
2142000	2144000	arriving back to their quonset hut.
2144000	2148000	The Marines were greeted by their gunnery sergeant and a warrant officer.
2148000	2150000	The commanding officers checked on the Marines,
2150000	2153000	asked them about their mission and what they saw,
2153000	2157000	and reminded the men whatever they encountered was just simple flares,
2157000	2159000	and to not tell others.
2159000	2164000	Um, we drive back to base our shift.
2164000	2166000	This was like two, three.
2166000	2169000	We finished our shift just by standing by again.
2169000	2171000	Not a lot of talking.
2174000	2176000	Back to our quonset huts.
2179000	2184000	By 7 a.m., our gunnery sergeant and our chief warrant officer
2184000	2189000	was hanging out in our quonset hut, which is strange.
2189000	2192000	Marines don't do things with a lot of words.
2192000	2198000	They do things by presence and implying something.
2199000	2202000	Seems like they were checking in on us.
2202000	2204000	We already knew what it was about,
2204000	2207000	but it's just like some flair activity out there, guys.
2207000	2209000	Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
2209000	2211000	It was implied we knew what they were saying.
2211000	2213000	This is flares.
2213000	2216000	You guys stumble across something.
2216000	2218000	You shouldn't have seen, but no big deal.
2218000	2222000	Now, it is my opinion the warrant officer and gunnery sergeant
2222000	2226000	were not briefed on the incident, the triangle or the black team.
2226000	2229000	And this is because of the way USAP or unacknowledged
2229000	2231000	special access programs are conducted,
2231000	2234000	which I do believe, in fact, Castle encountered.
2234000	2238000	Therefore, these commanding officers would not have a need to know
2238000	2240000	about the triangle or the operation.
2240000	2245000	Therefore, I think it is highly likely bordering on absolute certainty.
2245000	2249000	The commanding officers were informed Marines in their command
2249000	2253000	had encountered USAP operations and sensitive materials
2253000	2256000	and were to remind their Marines to retain absolute silence
2256000	2258000	about their encounter.
2258000	2261000	Now, one of the most intriguing pieces here is the day
2261000	2265000	following the incident, Castle was subject to an anthrax booster.
2265000	2269000	Castle had, shortly before Hunter Warrior, already received a booster
2269000	2272000	for his already taken anthrax vaccine,
2272000	2275000	so why another immediately after the counter?
2275000	2279000	Indeed, DOD mandates for all US military personnel
2279000	2284000	to vaccinate against anthrax did not go effect until December 1997
2284000	2288000	and from the Gulf War in 1991 up to 1997,
2288000	2293000	only some troops, if necessary, were given the anthrax vaccines and boosters.
2293000	2299000	The following day, we were called to medical
2299000	2303000	and given an anthrax booster, they called it.
2304000	2309000	Now, as far as we knew, we had already been given the anthrax vaccine,
2309000	2311000	maybe a year prior.
2311000	2312000	Right.
2312000	2317000	It was always controversial, but we did it because we were told
2317000	2321000	and in those days, there was a lot of grumbling among the Marines
2321000	2326000	and there was usually a guy with a rifle near the medical area
2326000	2330000	where they're giving the anthrax, sometimes people would talk.
2330000	2332000	So it doesn't feel like a suggestion you take?
2332000	2336000	Yeah, again, a Marine thing, a suggestion that we're all taking this
2336000	2338000	and keep your mouth shut.
2338000	2340000	Had you already received like a booster?
2340000	2344000	Because I know that, like you said, the anthrax vaccine was already controversial.
2344000	2348000	I know that for some servicemen, it was forced if they were overseas,
2348000	2350000	the Middle East and later on.
2350000	2353000	That's my question.
2353000	2358000	It wasn't like we were getting ready to go somewhere where there had been a scare or something.
2358000	2360000	It was just me and those guys.
2360000	2366000	So again, it's hard not to get, but it was us and there was a guy with a rifle
2366000	2369000	and we signed something like we did before.
2369000	2372000	First time we signed the, took the anthrax vaccine,
2372000	2375000	all of us signed something from what I remember.
2375000	2378000	So after you take the booster, did anyone ever come up to you
2378000	2382000	and tell you do not talk about what you saw after the Warren officer as well speaking to you?
2382000	2385000	Were you ever forced to sign anything regarding the incident or just...
2385000	2388000	Not about that. Nothing specific.
2388000	2390000	Implied, implied.
2390000	2393000	It's a general feel that Marines will keep their mouth shut if told,
2393000	2395000	which is generally true.
2395000	2399000	Now, of course, if it was just Castle here, I wouldn't be surprised.
2399000	2404000	But knowing two other Marines with similar stories, of course, I asked.
2404000	2408000	And to my surprise, I learned that both Michael Herrera and Jonathan Weygant
2408000	2412000	stated they were subject to anthrax boosters immediately after encountering.
2412000	2417000	In Weygant's case, a team of black operators and a crashed non-human UFO.
2417000	2423000	And in Michael's case, a team of black operators and an enormous 300 foot diameter,
2423000	2426000	eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle.
2426000	2430000	Perhaps it really is too conspiratorial to think what could have possibly been
2430000	2435000	the purpose of this anthrax booster, but it is a data point we simply cannot ignore.
2435000	2440000	Following his exit from the Marine Corps, Castle attempted to push the encounter from his mind
2440000	2445000	while also dealing with the psychological trauma of being detained at gunpoint
2445000	2448000	by American operators on US soil.
2448000	2452000	By 2002, Castle had an additional bizarre experience
2452000	2456000	that may possibly relate to UFO legacy program operations.
2456000	2460000	Wackenhut, now called G4S Solutions,
2460000	2464000	is a prominent private security firm founded in 1954
2464000	2468000	that is synonymous with UFO legacy programs.
2468000	2474000	I have spoken about Wackenhut previously as the trainers to Department of Energy Special Response Teams,
2474000	2479000	or SRTs, which may have comprised the operators that detained and interrogated
2479000	2485000	Jonathan Weygant in the jungles of northern Peru in late March, early April, 1997.
2485000	2490000	I have also discussed Wackenhut's infamous board member, CIA Deputy Director,
2490000	2494000	NSA Director, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
2494000	2499000	Director of National Intelligence, Director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, Bobby Ray Inman.
2499000	2505000	I have discussed Inman in numerous projects, so I recommend checking out any of these videos.
2505000	2510000	It's only become more significant now once I started doing some research
2510000	2518000	and realizing possible sources of those type of mercenaries that do that work.
2518000	2525000	And a combination of my Marine Brothers, Herrera, Weygant, hearing their stories and being like,
2525000	2531000	finally there was a triangle, enough information that I could start digging locations, contracts,
2531000	2539000	government contracts back in the 90s in the term, not the term, the company Wackenhut kept coming up.
2539000	2547000	And then I remember I was recruited, not a recruit, I received a letter of an event, a recruiting event by them.
2547000	2557000	When I first got out of the reserves, the New York Army National Guard in 2002.
2557000	2560000	And it was within three months of me getting out.
2560000	2569000	At the time I figured I'm just on a list of veterans, however they got that, they were data mining and they got my email.
2569000	2574000	But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt,
2574000	2578000	if nothing else it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset.
2578000	2585000	Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters.
2585000	2595000	They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1 Cobra's, Super Cobra's,
2595000	2598000	which I knew enough about that I could work on them.
2598000	2603000	But that's interesting because you were just training as a helicopter flight medic, that wasn't your MOS, your MOS was?
2603000	2607000	I'd left the ordnance behind at the New York Air National Guard at Syracuse.
2607000	2612000	So they knew something about you, if they knew that you were actively training as a helicopter flight medic.
2612000	2621000	In 2002, three years after he left service, Castle was approached out of the blue by Wackenhut to join their helicopter teams.
2621000	2627000	Wackenhut seemingly knew all about Castle's military service record in training as a helicopter flight medic.
2627000	2631000	But why discuss this, and why is Wackenhut important to mention,
2631000	2637000	and what significance can we find in Wackenhut attempting to contract a Marine Corps Sergeant,
2637000	2642000	who seemed to observe clandestine UFO legacy program operations?
2642000	2648000	Well, aside from the possible involvement with the DOE NEST, or Nuclear Emergency Response Teams,
2648000	2652000	that brutalized Waygant and having Inman serve on their board of directors,
2652000	2661000	Wackenhut is one of the most infamous and prolific private security agencies associated with UFO legacy program operations.
2661000	2666000	Wackenhut has both been implicated with performing security for UFO legacy program sites,
2666000	2672000	or in Waygant's case, possibly involved with clandestine UFO crash retrieval operations.
2672000	2678000	We mention Wackenhut only ever so briefly now, but please keep them in your mind for later for much more investigation,
2678000	2686000	and the possibility that the team Castle observed was a Wackenhut trained and manned DOE SRT.
2686000	2694000	Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security for many U.S. and DOE installations,
2694000	2699000	and these include the Nevada Test Site and ever-elusive Groom Lake Area 51.
2699000	2706000	Famously, Wackenhut worked perimeter security for Area 51 and caught Bob Lazar and his friends
2706000	2711000	who attempted to camp out on Bureau of Land Management Lands overlooking Dreamland
2711000	2717000	to observe test flights of the sports model UFO, quite an interesting little piece of UFO lore here.
2718000	2729000	Now, let's finally analyze Castle's testimony in its entirety to transform a firsthand UFO encounter
2729000	2735000	into what I propose is a unique glimpse into UFO legacy program operations.
2735000	2741000	Castle's sighting of the Triangle and its operational ground team occurred within the area of operations
2741000	2745000	of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms.
2746000	2752000	During the 2nd to 14th March 1997, Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment
2752000	2757000	while Castle was attached to a special-purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.
2757000	2761000	Recall how I mentioned earlier that true insights into Castle's testimony
2761000	2767000	occur when we analyzed the Hunter Warrior experiment out of USMC 29 Palm Center.
2767000	2774000	Indeed, as I mentioned, I believe USMC's involvement in UFO legacy programs is slim to none
2774000	2780000	and as you will see shortly, our analysis will turn us away from the USMC completely.
2780000	2786000	Let's now briefly touch on again the Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment.
2786000	2791000	Hunter Warrior sought to explore experimental methods to increase the area of influence
2791000	2797000	and combat effectiveness of Marine units by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment
2797000	2800000	and new warfighting tactics and techniques.
2800000	2804000	This experiment was conducted with three core objectives in mind,
2804000	2808000	tactical operations on the disperse non-contiguous battlefield,
2808000	2813000	C4I or command control communications computers and intelligence
2813000	2818000	to harness a single shared digital comms network over multiple battlefield areas
2818000	2822000	and enhancement of fire support and targeting improvements.
2822000	2826000	Indeed, according to a 1997 USMC news release titled
2826000	2830000	Findings Released on Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment,
2830000	2835000	Hunter Warrior could be neatly summarized as an experiment that, quote,
2835000	2838000	took a look at enhancing Marine units effectiveness
2838000	2845000	by utilizing a combination of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques, end quote.
2845000	2849000	It is the same news release we can even garner insights on Castle's
2849000	2853000	Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force
2853000	2857000	or as the USMC call it, SPM-A-G-T-F-X.
2857000	2863000	We can learn that this special task force was involved not only in the three objectives of Hunter Warrior,
2863000	2866000	but additionally all three phases which included
2866000	2871000	Phase 1, focus on reconnaissance surveillance, shaping and deception operations
2871000	2875000	by both Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force
2875000	2877000	and the Operating Aggressor Force.
2878000	2882000	Phase 2, study of targeting for initial engagements by air
2882000	2885000	and long-range indirect fire missions.
2885000	2889000	And finally, Phase 3, major night movement by the Operating Forces,
2889000	2892000	additional targeting for the Task Force,
2892000	2895000	and culmination with a mobile raid on opposing forces.
2895000	2897000	Recall how Castle's experience occurred
2897000	2903000	whilst performing overnight crash retrieval exercises for AV-8B Harrier jets.
2903000	2909000	It is by considering this, I wager this incident occurred during the third phase of Hunter Warrior.
2909000	2914000	And before we go any further, let's revisit a few details of Castle's encounter.
2914000	2919000	Castle encountered a massive, exotic, human-made aerospace vehicle
2919000	2924000	that I will make the case was reverse engineered from non-human technology
2924000	2928000	alongside a heavily armed ground team equipped with tactical vehicles
2928000	2932000	resistant to the craft's electromagnetic effects.
2932000	2937000	This clandestine team was operating in the area of operations of, at the time,
2937000	2943000	the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory
2943000	2946000	involving several ground and air combat units.
2946000	2950000	Clearly, the Triangle and its clandestine Special Mission Unit
2950000	2955000	did not choose the remote uninhabited area of Emerson Dry Lakebed
2955000	2959000	that was right smack in the middle of the Hunter Warrior experiment
2959000	2962000	to be seen by friendly American servicemen.
2962000	2967000	The team chose an active warfighter experiment zone to operate in the shadows.
2967000	2971000	Due to these factors, it is bordering on certainty
2971000	2975000	the Triangle and the clandestine team wish to operate on range
2975000	2979000	in the AO of the Hunter Warfighter experiment undetected.
2979000	2982000	But what was their objective?
2982000	2986000	I theorize this team and its craft secret via USAP,
2986000	2990000	or Intelligence Community CAP, Controlled Access Program.
2990000	2994000	Wish to attach themselves to Hunter Warrior to train and run practice ops
2994000	2998000	alongside blue, a.k.a. friendly assets
2998000	3002000	while maintaining secrecy hidden out of sight from blue soldiers, personnel,
3002000	3005000	vehicles, comms, networks, etc.
3005000	3007000	But let me explain.
3007000	3009000	As I have already mentioned,
3009000	3013000	Castles' experience strikes similar chords to that of Herrera and Weigant.
3013000	3015000	In Weigant's case in 2009,
3015000	3018000	the young Marines stumbled upon a clandestine team
3018000	3021000	with tactical vehicles actively loading containers,
3021000	3024000	possibly filled with humans under an enormous
3024000	3030000	octagonal alien reproduction vehicle in the jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia.
3030000	3033000	In Weigant's case in 1997,
3033000	3037000	just days or a few weeks after Castles' experience,
3037000	3041000	the young Marine was detained and interrogated by a clandestine team
3041000	3045000	in all black that seemingly sprung out of nowhere
3045000	3049000	in the Peruvian jungle after Weigant and other Marines
3049000	3053000	had arrived to the scene of a crashed non-human object.
3053000	3055000	In all three scenarios,
3055000	3058000	young Marines performing their duties were held at gunpoint
3058000	3061000	and threatened with death several times.
3061000	3065000	In one case, Castles, the earliest of the three,
3065000	3069000	the clandestine all black team fled once their overwatch triangle
3069000	3073000	darted out of sight, and clearly some commanding officer
3073000	3077000	or person of authority contacted USMC commanding officers
3077000	3081000	to make sure the Marines who stumbled upon the secret operation by accident
3081000	3086000	would not discuss encountering the USAP or CAP technology.
3086000	3088000	In the other two encounters,
3088000	3091000	the Marines were forcibly stripped of their gear, debriefed,
3091000	3094000	and forced to sign extensive non-disclosure agreements
3094000	3098000	under penalty of death by senior Air Force personnel.
3098000	3102000	This series of events implies that after Castles' encounter,
3102000	3105000	systems were put in place for how these black teams
3105000	3108000	would actually deal with blue or friendly assets
3108000	3110000	stumbling upon their missions,
3110000	3115000	while conducting operations parallel but out of sight to blue assets.
3115000	3118000	Although the triangle and team clearly failed
3118000	3121000	this hypothesized directive in Hunter Warrior
3121000	3124000	to operate in the shadows free from USMCIs,
3124000	3127000	this theory also supports that clearly
3127000	3131000	methods were developed to deal with such blue encounters moving forward.
3131000	3136000	And indeed, I do have further statements to support this hypothesis.
3136000	3139000	Recently, Ross Colthart has come out to state
3139000	3142000	he believes with high conviction that thanks to his many sources
3142000	3146000	the infamous tic-tac encountered by Commander David Fraver
3146000	3150000	of the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego in 2004
3150000	3153000	was Lockheed Martin's gunkworks technology.
3153000	3156000	Now regarding this controversial statement,
3156000	3161000	I have zero knowledge if the tic-tac was for sure human-made technology.
3161000	3165000	I do, however, have my own framework that there are non-human tic-tacs
3165000	3167000	and human-made copy tic-tacs,
3167000	3171000	but let's entertain Ross's theory here for a moment.
3171000	3176000	If, and I mean if the tic-tac was indeed reverse engineer technology
3176000	3178000	out of the Lockheed skunkworks,
3178000	3181000	the flying propane tank like Kraft
3181000	3184000	operating in restrictive active US Navy airspace
3184000	3188000	that actually flew to the Navy aircraft cap point,
3188000	3192000	which cap is a combat air patrol designated reference point.
3192000	3195000	Don't confuse this with controlled access program cap.
3195000	3198000	Clearly sought to operate and test on blue assets.
3198000	3203000	In this case, Commander David Fraver in the VFA-41 Black Aces.
3203000	3207000	Now, some of the arguments I have seen for the tic-tac not being man-made
3207000	3212000	are claims that the Navy or any US entity would never test technologies
3212000	3215000	on their own pilots and servicemen.
3215000	3218000	But this is incorrect and this is actually done commonly.
3218000	3221000	So, if the tic-tac was flying within the AO
3221000	3226000	or area of operations of the USS Nimitz aviation exercises,
3226000	3230000	this would imply the tic-tac could have been gauging reaction types,
3230000	3234000	times, speeds, methods, etc. of an unknowing force
3234000	3238000	if any blue assets were to ever make unknown enemy contact.
3238000	3242000	Warning the pilots beforehand taint the results and observations.
3242000	3246000	But remember, all this around the Nimitz is just a hypothesis.
3246000	3251000	But if true clearly ties into CASEL and demonstrates instances
3251000	3254000	in which human-made reverse engineered vehicles
3254000	3259000	operate within acknowledged war games or large-scale warfighter experiments
3259000	3265000	to both test on blue assets and operate in the shadows parallel to blue assets.
3265000	3270000	The Nimitz here also gives us a perfect segue into the Navy.
3270000	3274000	Why in the world would we discuss the Navy over USMC?
3274000	3279000	Well, this is because I believe with very strong conviction might I add.
3279000	3284000	The triangular craft and team operated at the behest of the US Navy
3284000	3289000	with likely cooperation or assets sharing with the US Air Force.
3289000	3295000	Let me explain here, and this will shockingly tie into much of my previous work.
3295000	3301000	Returning to the 1997 USMC news release Detailing Findings on Hunter Warrior
3301000	3304000	we can see both the Marine Corps Combat Development Center
3304000	3307000	and the Center for Naval Analysis
3307000	3313000	release summary of experiment findings to the Deputy Commanding General of the MCCDC.
3313000	3315000	The Center for Naval Analysis,
3315000	3319000	administrated by the CNA Corporation, is a Department of Defense
3319000	3324000	and Navy Federally-Funded Research and Development Center, or FFRDC
3324000	3326000	as we will call it from here on out.
3326000	3331000	If you are a longtime viewer of my channel, this is definitely old news.
3331000	3333000	But if you are a new viewer to my channel,
3333000	3337000	the foundation of my research points to FFRDCs
3337000	3339000	and how these semi-private government-controlled
3339000	3342000	research development tests and evaluation centers
3342000	3345000	act as liaison between the United States government
3345000	3348000	slash DOD and US defense contractors
3348000	3353000	for UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs
3353000	3356000	alongside their university counterparts,
3356000	3360000	university-affiliated research centers, or UARCs.
3360000	3363000	Such institutions, according to my work,
3363000	3365000	serve as subject matter experts
3365000	3369000	and provide necessary R&D work on project materials.
3369000	3371000	This would in turn keep knowledge access
3371000	3375000	in technology of unknown origin programs quite strict,
3375000	3379000	only allowing contractor personnel with the need to know full insights
3379000	3384000	into the full extent of the non-human materials on which the programs focus.
3384000	3388000	The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs.
3388000	3393000	UARCs here include the applied physics laboratories at John Hopkins
3393000	3395000	and the University of Washington,
3395000	3397000	as well as the applied research laboratories
3397000	3399000	at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,
3399000	3401000	University of Texas at Austin,
3401000	3404000	and Pennsylvania State University.
3404000	3408000	Penn State's UARC was established in 1945
3408000	3412000	by future Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker.
3412000	3416000	Walker is a critical figure in the research of my channel.
3416000	3420000	Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board
3420000	3425000	as participating in 1950s UFO crash retrieval
3425000	3429000	and reverse engineering programs alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.
3429000	3432000	If you want to learn more about Walker and Bush,
3432000	3434000	go watch my recent Aztec video.
3434000	3436000	I especially recommend that video
3436000	3438000	because the Center for Naval Analysis
3438000	3444000	can trace its founding to 1942's anti-summery warfare operations group
3444000	3448000	that was formed to assist the U.S. Navy with scientific advice
3448000	3451000	for finding and attacking U-boats.
3451000	3453000	Of course, in the Aztec video,
3453000	3457000	we devote over an hour to analyzing how and why.
3457000	3461000	Scientists involved with anti-summery technology and warfare
3461000	3465000	working under Vannevar Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development
3465000	3469000	served as primary sources to details and findings
3469000	3476000	on the 25 March 1948 crashed 99.9 foot disc at Aztec, New Mexico.
3476000	3479000	A connection I never in a million years
3479000	3482000	would have thought to make to castle in this video,
3482000	3484000	but here we are.
3484000	3486000	You will find nothing publicly
3486000	3488000	connecting the Center for Naval Analysis
3488000	3491000	to UFO legacy program operations.
3491000	3495000	These connections only exist in the words of my sources to me,
3495000	3498000	so take that for what you will.
3498000	3501000	But why in the world would a naval FFRDC
3501000	3504000	publish findings on Hunter Warrior?
3504000	3507000	Was this for a good old-fashioned corporate reporting write-up,
3507000	3509000	or in my opinion,
3509000	3513000	a secondary report created by a tendril of the naval involvement
3513000	3516000	in UFO legacy program operations
3516000	3520000	that could easily backchannel USAP slash CAP data, reports,
3520000	3524000	and results of ARV applications alongside blue assets
3524000	3528000	back to the Navy while avoiding the marine chain of command?
3528000	3530000	Well, as it turns out,
3530000	3533000	the US Navy was integral to Hunter Warrior,
3533000	3537000	but not in a majorly acknowledged fashion.
3538000	3541000	In 1995, Vice Admiral Robert Spain,
3541000	3544000	then Commander of Naval Air Force Pacific,
3544000	3548000	detailed the possibility of getting naval carrier tactical aviation
3548000	3553000	involved in supporting troops ashore in a December 95 report titled,
3553000	3555000	quote,
3555000	3558000	an operational examination of sea-based aerial fire support
3558000	3561000	for engaged troops, end quote.
3561000	3564000	This proposed a new mission involving different training procedures
3564000	3566000	and employment concepts for aircrews
3566000	3569000	operating from aircraft carriers in close concert
3569000	3572000	with ground forces in a non-linear battlefield.
3572000	3575000	At the behest of Admiral J. Johnson,
3575000	3578000	Chief of Naval Operations, in late 1996,
3578000	3582000	General Charles Krulak, Commander of the Marine Corps,
3582000	3586000	quote, requested that Commander Naval Strike Air Warfare Center,
3586000	3589000	Fallon, Nevada, assemble aircrews from Fallon
3589000	3592000	in Naval Air Station, LeMore, California
3592000	3596000	to explore the Hunter Air concept during Hunter Warrior,
3596000	3599000	which evaluated a wide variety of technologies
3599000	3602000	and evolutionary tactics, end quote.
3602000	3605000	The involvement of two naval facilities,
3605000	3608000	the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada,
3608000	3613000	now called the Naval Aviation Warfare Development Center, or NAWDC,
3613000	3615000	as we will call it from here on out,
3615000	3618000	and the Naval Air Station, LeMore, California,
3618000	3621000	or NASA LeMore, as we will start calling it,
3621000	3624000	were an adjunct to Hunter Warrior,
3624000	3627000	bolted on late in the planning state.
3627000	3630000	According to my theory we're about to explore,
3630000	3634000	NAWDC and NASA LeMore entered into Hunter Warrior
3634000	3636000	at the last second,
3636000	3639000	realizing an opportunity to engage their ARV
3639000	3642000	and special mission units in wargame exercise
3642000	3646000	to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc.
3646000	3649000	And of course, we have several avenues
3649000	3652000	to pursue to support this theory.
3652000	3655000	Top Gunner, what really is called
3655000	3658000	Naval Strike Air Warfare Center,
3658000	3661000	came here in 1996,
3661000	3664000	and the Naval Air Station has been here for us
3664000	3666000	a lot longer than that,
3666000	3668000	and it's a tenant command at the base
3668000	3671000	that does a lot of its training and learning
3671000	3673000	and its universities out there
3673000	3676000	when they prepare and train in the desert.
3677000	3680000	In projects past, I have detailed at length
3680000	3683000	programs and efforts of the U.S. Navy
3683000	3687000	to retrieve, exploit, and store non-human vehicles.
3687000	3690000	I really recommend if you haven't seen that,
3690000	3692000	stopping now and watching my video
3692000	3695000	on Navy UFO Legacy Program Operations
3695000	3698000	and come back, which explores everything
3698000	3701000	from the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office
3701000	3703000	to Admiral Bobby Ray Inman
3703000	3706000	to the Deep Submergence Systems Project
3706000	3711000	to a 1991 Deep Sea Triangle UFO Recovery.
3711000	3713000	But we will stick to Castle here
3713000	3718000	and get to know NAWDC and Nassla Mour a little more.
3718000	3721000	NAWDC is the Navy's center of excellence
3721000	3724000	for air combat training and development.
3724000	3727000	NAWDC trains naval aviation
3727000	3730000	in advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures
3730000	3733000	across assigned combat mission areas
3733000	3737000	at the individual unit integrated in joint levels,
3737000	3740000	ensuring alignment of the training continuum
3740000	3743000	to set and enforce combat proficiency standards
3743000	3746000	to develop, validate, standardize, publish,
3746000	3750000	and revise tactics, techniques, and procedures."
3750000	3753000	NAWDC was set up in 1996
3753000	3756000	to consolidate the Naval Strike Warfare Center,
3756000	3759000	the Navy Fighter Weapon School Top Gun,
3759000	3763000	in the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapon School Top Dome.
3763000	3767000	NAWDC provides service to aircrews, squadrons,
3767000	3769000	and airwings of the U.S. Navy
3769000	3772000	through flight training, academic instructional classes,
3772000	3775000	and direct operational and intelligence support.
3775000	3778000	And remember that I said Navy Flight Training
3778000	3780000	in the Top Gun School here.
3780000	3784000	I'm sure none of you need reminding to Top Gun or Top Gun Maverick.
3784000	3786000	Attention on deck!
3790000	3793000	Good morning.
3793000	3796000	Welcome to your special training detachment.
3796000	3798000	You see it.
3798000	3801000	Emmanuel Bates, NAWDC commander.
3801000	3804000	You're all Top Gun graduates.
3804000	3806000	The elite.
3806000	3808000	The best of the best.
3808000	3810000	That was yesterday.
3810000	3813000	The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter
3813000	3815000	has leveled the playing field.
3815000	3818000	Details are few, but you'll be able to see
3818000	3820000	details are few, but you can be sure
3820000	3822000	we no longer possess the technological advantage.
3822000	3825000	Success, now more than ever,
3825000	3828000	comes down to the man or woman in the box.
3828000	3831000	Half of you will make the cut.
3831000	3834000	One of you will be named mission leader.
3834000	3837000	The other half will remain in reserve.
3837000	3840000	Your instructor is a Top Gun graduate
3840000	3843000	with real-world experience in every mission aspect
3843000	3845000	you will be expected to master.
3845000	3848000	His exploits are legendary.
3848000	3851000	And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots
3851000	3854000	this program has ever produced.
3854000	3857000	What he has to teach you may very well
3857000	3860000	mean the difference between life and death.
3860000	3863000	I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.
3863000	3866000	Call sign Maverick.
3875000	3878000	This is the first time I've ever seen
3878000	3881000	an officer in the Navy.
3881000	3883000	The Navy is the most successful
3883000	3886000	intelligence in the office of naval research
3886000	3889000	as spearheading numerous U.S. Navy
3889000	3891000	UFO legacy programs.
3891000	3893000	NAWDC is also, quote,
3893000	3896000	the primary authority on training and tactics
3896000	3898000	development.
3898000	3900000	NAWDC provides training, assessment,
3900000	3903000	aviation requirement recommendations,
3903000	3906000	combat search and rescue, close air support,
3906000	3909000	and associated planning support systems, end quote.
3909000	3912000	Funny enough, this naval facility
3912000	3915000	out of Fallon, Nevada also runs the FTRC
3915000	3918000	or the Fallon Range and Training Complex.
3918000	3921000	An enormous training range just north
3921000	3923000	of the Nevada Test Site and Nevada Test
3923000	3925000	and Training Range MRTFB,
3925000	3928000	or Major Range and Test Facility Base,
3928000	3931000	used extensively by Area 51 Groom Lake,
3931000	3934000	a detachment of Edwards 412 Test Wing.
3934000	3937000	A long time critical component of my work
3937000	3940000	has been discussion of air training ranges
3940000	3943000	for UFO legacy program operations.
3943000	3946000	Specifically, test and operational flight testing
3946000	3948000	of reproduction vehicles.
3948000	3951000	This subject will come up again soon,
3951000	3954000	critical in my opinion, to solving the who,
3954000	3957000	what, and why of Castle's Encounter.
3957000	3960000	Now, I have discussed at length aerial training ranges
3960000	3963000	such as Dugway's Utah Test and Training Range,
3963000	3967000	Area 51 and Nellis' Nevada Test and Training Range,
3967000	3971000	and Edwards 412 Test Wing, Restricted Flight Airspace
3971000	3974000	and directly accused each of these locations
3974000	3977000	of operating and testing alien reproduction vehicles
3977000	3979000	on these ranges.
3979000	3981000	Therefore, it is intriguing to me,
3981000	3984000	NAWDC and Fallon, Nevada extremely close
3984000	3987000	to both the NTTR and UTTR
3987000	3990000	and added as adjunct to Hunter Warrior
3990000	3994000	employs its own enormous aerial training range complex.
3994000	4001000	And of course, NAWDC is no stranger to sightings of triangles.
4001000	4005000	In 2002, a witness in Fallon, Nevada reported a quote
4005000	4008000	very large craft at 11.13 p.m.
4008000	4011000	that he thought at first was a B-52.
4011000	4016000	It was a huge flying triangle with no running lights,
4016000	4020000	but it did have some 7-9 dimly lit nodes.
4020000	4024000	It flew at 20 miles per hour making no noise.
4024000	4028000	It was astonishingly close and so large.
4028000	4030000	Total event time was 8 seconds.
4030000	4033000	The witness had a clear view of the side and bottom of the ship
4033000	4037000	but could not make out the leading edge or rear of the craft.
4038000	4041000	Welcome to Naval Air Station LaMoure,
4041000	4046000	the Navy's newest, largest and only West Coast master jet face.
4046000	4051000	NAS LaMoure is home port for every Navy strike fighter squadron
4051000	4053000	on the West Coast.
4053000	4056000	These squadrons are equipped with F-A-18 Hornet
4056000	4058000	and Sufer Hornet aircraft.
4060000	4064000	The Air Station's new 9 million dollar air traffic control tower
4064000	4069000	is part of the Navy's largest and busiest air traffic control facility.
4070000	4074000	NAS LaMoure is the Navy's newest and largest master jet base
4074000	4076000	located in Northern California.
4076000	4079000	LaMoure is home to several carrier air wings
4079000	4082000	as well as the entire strike fighter wing Pacific.
4082000	4085000	And just as NAWDC,
4085000	4089000	NAS LaMoure is no stranger to triangle sightings.
4089000	4092000	These include the 2001 testimony
4092000	4096000	of Navy Aviation Maintenance Administrator Angelo Assetta
4096000	4099000	who stated he observed a triangular glowing object
4099000	4103000	with white glowing points above FRC West NAS LaMoure.
4103000	4107000	After observing the craft travel slowly for three minutes,
4107000	4112000	the vehicle departed at a seemingly instantaneous speed out of sight.
4112000	4117000	Assetta claimed to observe the same vehicle four times between February
4117000	4121000	to October 2012 with no response from the Naval Air Station.
4121000	4124000	NAS LaMoure also shares some intriguing ties
4124000	4127000	with a usual tricky customer of this channel.
4127000	4130000	An Air Force Base I suspect is intimately involved
4130000	4133000	in ARV testing and flight programs.
4133000	4137000	Edwards and their illustrious 412 test wing.
4137000	4141000	And just remember Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
4141000	4145000	claimed to observe man-made triangular craft called TR-3B
4145000	4148000	and don't worry we will explore this more shortly
4148000	4154000	over Edwards Air Force Base less than 90 miles away from Castles Encounter.
4154000	4156000	One night a longtime friend of mine
4156000	4159000	and I were standing on top of the Fairchild A-10 hangar
4159000	4161000	at Edwards Air Force Base.
4161000	4164000	It was 2 a.m. and a perfectly clear night
4164000	4167000	with millions of stars visible to the naked eye.
4167000	4171000	This was a very common night at Edwards.
4171000	4174000	I noticed a group of stars
4174000	4177000	who were looking at it seemed to be shifting in color
4177000	4181000	and at the time I could name quite a few constellations.
4181000	4185000	I had just taken an astrology course
4185000	4188000	and definitely knew what the Big Dipper was.
4188000	4192000	I made a C and I made a C in that course I think or B.
4192000	4196000	So I put it out to my friend that the three stars near the Big Dipper
4196000	4200000	in triangular formation were not supposed to be there.
4200000	4203000	We watched as the strobing stars shifted in color
4203000	4208000	from a bright blue to a reddish yellow.
4208000	4211000	After a period of about 20 minutes
4211000	4213000	we could tell that the objects weren't stars
4213000	4215000	because they were getting larger.
4215000	4217000	This was somewhat unnerving.
4217000	4221000	It was further unnerving when the space in between the stars
4221000	4225000	started blocking out the stars in the background.
4225000	4229000	We decided it probably was the top secret Air Force vehicle of some type.
4229000	4231000	Still we weren't sure.
4231000	4234000	At the time I didn't believe in UFOs.
4234000	4236000	That's the honest truth.
4236000	4239000	The vehicle had gone from half the size of the Big Dipper
4239000	4242000	to twice its size in a half hour.
4242000	4245000	It had moved from the west to the east towards Edwards Air Force Base.
4245000	4249000	About that time we could make out the silhouette or outline of the triangle.
4249000	4252000	The lights were possibly exhaust, flared brighter
4252000	4255000	and vanished in an instant from the sky.
4255000	4259000	Of course, as the primary naval facility involved with Hunter Warrior
4259000	4262000	I do believe a strong case can be built.
4262000	4265000	The triangle castle observed hailed from Nautic,
4265000	4268000	but I do for a little bit want to explore the concept
4268000	4272000	that the triangle could have come from Nassla-Mor, Edwards
4272000	4275000	or some sort of combination between the two.
4275000	4279000	Now, do you recall all the way back in this investigation
4279000	4283000	where I mentioned Castle's encounter occurred within the FAA airspace
4283000	4286000	designated as R-2501C?
4286000	4293000	Well, Nassla-Mor is one of few facilities that has access to the R-2508 complex,
4293000	4297000	a section of restricted airspace and associated land
4297000	4301000	presently used and managed by three principal military activities
4301000	4304000	in the Upper Mojave Desert region.
4304000	4309000	The R-2508 complex is compromised of internal restricted areas,
4309000	4313000	military operations areas, air traffic control assigned airspace areas
4313000	4316000	and other special use airspaces.
4316000	4321000	Use of these areas include bombing ranges, supersonic corridors,
4321000	4326000	low-altitude high-speed maneuvers, radar intercept areas and refueling areas.
4326000	4330000	The R-2508 sits near Antelope Valley,
4330000	4336000	a location containing several aerospace facilities, RCS or radar cross-section ranges,
4336000	4340000	and proposed deep underground military bases I've directly accused
4340000	4346000	with UFO legacy program operations, largely Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
4346000	4351000	R-2508 is managed by the National Training Center for Irwin,
4351000	4354000	Naval Air Weapon Station, China Lake,
4354000	4361000	and the 412th Test Wings Air Force Test Center out of Edwards Air Force Base.
4361000	4366000	In fact, alongside Edwards, China Lake, and Palmdale Plant 42,
4366000	4369000	which I have discussed extensively,
4369000	4372000	and Jeremy Corbell has recently listed street addresses
4372000	4377000	for calling for Congress to investigate UFO legacy sites with boots on the ground.
4377000	4384000	NASLAMOR now joins three other major entities I've connected to UFO legacy programs
4384000	4389000	with R-2508 Poncho 3 Clearance.
4389000	4393000	Poncho 3 Clearance allows only locally-based aircraft
4393000	4397000	in specific restricted sections of R-2508,
4397000	4401000	and I bring up R-2508 not just because of Edwards
4401000	4404000	and its proximity to CASEL's encounter,
4404000	4408000	but because of R-2508 and its principal entities.
4408000	4412000	I have spoken at length previously regarding China Lake,
4412000	4416000	UFO programs, and accused deep underground military bases.
4416000	4420000	But Edwards, well, Edwards and its 412th Test Wing
4420000	4424000	are one of the cornerstone pieces of my work.
4424000	4426000	Recall Ed.
4426000	4431000	Ed is a very real, very vetted individual I consider a hostile witness.
4431000	4436000	A witness who was summoned by SSCI or the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
4436000	4441000	and talked nonsense to avoid implication in illegal programs.
4441000	4446000	Ed spoke to Steven Greer, divulging many details regarding Edwards Air Force Base,
4446000	4451000	and Ed has blocked me on every single platform from which I have contacted him.
4451000	4455000	Ed began his Air Force career at the Nevada Test and Training Range,
4455000	4461000	specifically Nellis Air Force Base, while this NTTR was still called the 98th Range Wing.
4461000	4466000	As an engineering requirements manager with a degree in electrical engineering,
4466000	4473000	Ed claimed he was briefed at Area 51-S4 by an Air Force major into UFO programs.
4473000	4477000	Ed was told numerous craft had been caught or captured,
4477000	4484000	and it was at Nellis Ed became aware of joint UFO programs with specifically Lockheed and Boeing.
4484000	4489000	By the early 2000s, Ed was sent to Edwards for further range engineering work for Air Force
4489000	4494000	and DOD Premier Test and Evaluation Expertise for Aerospace Vehicles.
4494000	4503000	Ed managed the Air Force Flight Test Center, AFFTC, Experimental and Development Test and Evaluation Engineering Resources.
4508000	4510000	This is where barriers are broken.
4515000	4517000	This is where records are set.
4519000	4522000	This is the edge of what we are capable of.
4524000	4530000	This is where we look into a new frontier and see the future.
4533000	4536000	To fly faster, longer and safer.
4538000	4543000	To make our warriors stronger and our enemies tremble.
4546000	4549000	To push the boundaries of what we know is possible.
4550000	4557000	To deliver capabilities to the warfighter that will write history.
4560000	4562000	Our mission is test.
4564000	4567000	Our goal is to find the unknown.
4569000	4573000	We learn all there is about our technology and we go further.
4574000	4576000	We set the standard.
4577000	4579000	We are innovators.
4580000	4589000	Ed was also sent to Edwards Range Orientation as a student in Edwards Infamous 412th Test Wing Air Force Test Pilot School.
4589000	4601000	For multiple years at the Edwards 412th AFFTC, Ed served as Director of Operations for an electronics warfare group operating an acknowledged test infrastructure budget of $700 million.
4602000	4606000	Directly supervising 15 officers, civilians and enlisted personnel.
4606000	4617000	It was as director of an electronics warfare group, Ed claimed to act as the intermediary between scientists and AFFTC pilots of reverse engineered vehicles.
4617000	4626000	Vehicles reverse engineered from extraterrestrial technology, copycat vehicles sometimes manned requiring a pilot, sometimes not.
4627000	4633000	Ed's testimony has so much more to give as do clues to his testimony such as project red light.
4633000	4640000	So please watch my video on him to explore further statements of biologics likely being stored at Wright Patterson Hangar 5.
4640000	4650000	Videos of essentially invisible inspection UFOs and Ed's follow-up career at the Pentagon Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel Chain.
4650000	4658000	Where he observed $34 and $40 billion in respective years go towards non-transfer of authority funds.
4658000	4671000	I vehemently believe Ed's testimony and due to such, Edwards 412th Test Wing is one of the most critical sites, wings and air spaces to uncovering UFO legacy program operations in my opinion.
4671000	4678000	But that's not all. Recall the infamous story of the TR-3B as relayed by Edgar Fouchet.
4680000	4684000	It's exactly what the flying triangle is, the one that's been sighted around the world.
4684000	4690000	It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built.
4690000	4696000	And it may be stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium or your city.
4696000	4703000	Fouchet would disclose his testimony from himself and his five close friends slash sources in 1998.
4703000	4707000	Many have criticized the Air Force Master Sergeant Fouchet for his lack of evidence.
4707000	4713000	But as I have said many times, I have found tremendous value in studying Fouchet's disclosures.
4713000	4723000	According to Fouchet, TR-3B saw prototype flights begin in the early 1970s with successful implementation of gravity warping systems.
4723000	4729000	Fouchet would state three operational prototype systems were flying by 1994.
4729000	4735000	Triangles approximately 250 feet across, quite similar to castles 200 to 300 feet.
4735000	4740000	As well as an enormous 600 foot operational model.
4740000	4745000	Finally I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B.
4745000	4753000	A friend of mine said he'd never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom.
4753000	4759000	The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers.
4759000	4767000	According to Fouchet, the engineering of TR-3B was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan
4767000	4776000	and TR-3B's program was managed by three of six of the US Big Six intelligence agencies, NRO, NSA and CIA.
4776000	4786000	Fouchet would claim the gravity warping propulsion systems were reverse engineered from non-human technology from Sandia National Labs and Lawrence Livermore Labs.
4786000	4795000	Two Department of Energy FFRDCs, and Sandia is of course, as I say, a usual tricky customer of this channel.
4795000	4801000	The circular plasma field accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field Disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.
4801000	4805000	It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology.
4805000	4814000	Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse engineered DMF-D and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology.
4814000	4819000	But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you, nor am I.
4819000	4822000	The government will go at any lengths.
4822000	4826000	Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury based.
4826000	4836000	It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute
4836000	4841000	to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy.
4841000	4851000	The MF-D generates a magnetic vortex field which disrupts and neutralizes effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%.
4851000	4854000	Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.
4854000	4857000	Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.
4857000	4868000	The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator such as the crew compartment, avionics, MF-D systems, fuels, environmental systems,
4868000	4872000	and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%.
4872000	4880000	This causes the effect of making the aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed,
4880000	4884000	except of course those we didn't build.
4884000	4890000	TR-3B is an altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time.
4890000	4897000	Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude.
4897000	4904000	With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally.
4904000	4912000	So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn.
4912000	4916000	It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance.
4916000	4919000	For those that have seen it, that's how they do it.
4919000	4926000	TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform.
4926000	4932000	The multi-mode propulsion systems can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor
4932000	4938000	and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion.
4938000	4944000	By Fouchet's definition, this makes TR-3B an alien reproduction vehicle.
4944000	4950000	While the craft featured some systems we might associate with prosaia technology such as a triangular airframe,
4950000	4956000	odd but still recognizable rotatable crew compartments, computers, radar, and ECM,
4956000	4962000	or electronics communications measures and ECCM systems, the craft also featured propulsion systems
4962000	4966000	reverse engineered from non-human technology.
4966000	4970000	This then of course draws our attention back to 1988's Fluxliner,
4970000	4976000	that allegedly operated as a copycat saucer with non-human zero-point systems,
4976000	4983000	but also featured disheveled F4 Phantom jump seats and sloppy paints as well as bolted panels.
4983000	4991000	The ARV system for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities was indeed remarkably simple.
4991000	4998000	It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia
4998000	5004000	with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought.
5004000	5009000	You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy,
5009000	5013000	or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes.
5013000	5017000	In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off.
5017000	5022000	Of course, Castle saw only the underside and little of the side profile of the triangle
5022000	5026000	during this experience in the first half of March 1997.
5026000	5034000	But I cannot help but draw strong parallels between the craft Castle observed and Fuchet's TR-3B.
5034000	5043000	Obvious parallels include the 200-foot models detailed by Fuchet resembling the 200-300-foot parameters outlined by Castle,
5043000	5048000	but also reference here Fuchet's detailed illustration of TR-3B.
5049000	5052000	While working with a 3D artist to model Castle's craft,
5052000	5058000	one of the points Castle was absolutely adamant about was that the lights on each vertex of the triangle
5058000	5064000	appeared like embedded spherical orb lights and not flush lighting panels.
5064000	5069000	Although not orb or spherical, we can observe non-flush lights on Fuchet's illustrations
5069000	5076000	that Fuchet described as hydrogen-oxygen-vectored rocket engines to aid in craft propulsion.
5076000	5082000	Additionally, Castle firmly stated each corner of the equilateral triangle was rounded,
5082000	5085000	and the same can be seen in TR-3B.
5085000	5091000	Although the craft was almost vantablack, meaning blacker than black with low reflectivity,
5091000	5095000	Castle observed what appeared to be a concave dome-like structure,
5095000	5098000	unlit in the middle of the triangle.
5098000	5105000	We can clearly see the Mercury Plasma Accelerator Ring MFD Gravity Reduction Device on TR-3B
5105000	5110000	sitting as a large circular feature on the underside of TR-3B.
5110000	5117000	The strongest parallel to me, though, comes in the description of variable-vectored intake vents on TR-3B
5117000	5122000	observable from the top, bottom, and side profiles of the craft.
5122000	5125000	While witnessing primarily the underbelly of the triangle,
5125000	5133000	Castle discussed what appeared to be several ridges or vents between each spherical light on each vertex of the triangle.
5133000	5141000	Could Castle's craft indeed have been the infamous alien reproduction vehicle TR-3B illustrated by Edgar Fouchet?
5141000	5148000	Well, believe it or not, there are even further data points bolstering this hypothesis.
5148000	5155000	But Fouchet's most drastic revelations of TR-3B comes from who he claimed piloted the vehicles.
5155000	5160000	Fouchet would state both military and contractors operated TR-3B,
5160000	5168000	but military pilots were top of their class, elite pilots hailing from the Air Force and Navy test pilot schools
5168000	5175000	like Top Gun stationed at the NAWDC and AFFTC stationed at Edwards.
5175000	5182000	Could Edwards and NAWDC slash NASLAMOR slash naval programs at large
5182000	5186000	really have coordinated to operate reverse-engineered triangular craft
5186000	5193000	and special mission units alongside blue assets in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment?
5193000	5198000	While as it turns out, there is even more circumstantial data to suggest so.
5198000	5207000	The southernmost area of R2508 exists roughly 44.5 miles northwest of Emerson Dry Lakebed.
5207000	5213000	And recall Castle's testimony when the triangle departed at incomprehensible speeds.
5213000	5222000	It traveled in a northwest direction back to the direction of R2508 airspace operated by NASLAMOR, China Lake, and Edwards.
5222000	5229000	Back to the direction of Antelope Valley, which for decades has produced myriad UFO triangle testimonies.
5229000	5235000	Back to the direction where Fouchet claimed the Navy and Air Force top pilots operated TR-3B.
5235000	5242000	And back to the direction in which Ed had years of first-hand experience with reverse-engineered vehicles.
5243000	5248000	While I do believe TR-3B, or whatever you want to call a triangular ARV,
5248000	5259000	R2508, Edwards, NAWDC, and NASLAMOR are cornerstone and critical pieces to this investigation and my prevailing theory.
5259000	5268000	I do want to explore an alternate origin point for the craft, still involving naval and Air Force UFO legacy program operations.
5269000	5274000	Edwards and its R2508 are nestled within Antelope Valley.
5274000	5280000	Antelope Valley has historically served as the nexus of U.S. aerospace technology.
5280000	5286000	Housing the infamous Air Force Plant 42, Lockheed's Gunkwerks, the former Norton Air Force Base,
5286000	5295000	the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, and facilities Northrop Grumman, Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas operate as radar cross-section facilities.
5295000	5301000	These three radar cross-section facilities, specifically Northrop Tahan and Lockheed Hellendale,
5301000	5305000	are locations I have discussed extensively in prior work.
5306000	5316000	Antelope Valley in Palmdale, California has served as a cornerstone U.S. military-slash-private contractor-classified aircraft production and maintenance location.
5316000	5326000	With Air Force Plant 42 alone producing many of the United States' most famous advanced aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk,
5326000	5335000	the B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk, SR-71 Blackbird, F-22, and F-35 Lightning,
5335000	5343000	and as I stated earlier, Corbell recently listed street addresses for Plant 42 in relation to UFO legacy program operations.
5344000	5353000	First and foremost is Senator Rounds should ask to see Lockheed's Plant B-6 complex in Burbank, California, 2300 Empire Avenue,
5353000	5362000	and then I would like to, you know, maybe he should go ask to see Northrop Grumman's Plant 42 in Palmdale, which is 3520 East Avenue M Street.
5362000	5364000	I mean, look, the addresses are there.
5364000	5373000	While any of these aerospace locations mentioned above could have, and in my opinion do, engage in engineering, research development,
5373000	5383000	test and evaluation, and construction of ARV in the Antelope Valley, I do want to center our attention to the radar cross-section facilities Tehan and Hellendale.
5383000	5386000	But what is an RCS facility?
5386000	5393000	To summarize, these locations utilize high-frequency radio waves to test aircraft radar signatures.
5393000	5399000	This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing radar cross-section.
5399000	5410000	The radar cross-section sites utilize large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.
5410000	5416000	Many RCS facilities such as the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War.
5416000	5427000	This led the majority of the installations being built primarily underground to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies from Soviet spy satellites.
5427000	5441000	Numerous researchers over the years have accused the Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft.
5441000	5456000	The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrances for the Ant Hill Dome as well as actually been flown over these sites and personally observed the electromagnetic pulse weapons systems that are used to down craft.
5456000	5463000	Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this.
5463000	5471000	The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it.
5471000	5479000	I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.
5479000	5485000	So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.
5485000	5494000	It's just where the manmade UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.
5494000	5499000	They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-grabbitic anti-grab.
5499000	5506000	The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic.
5506000	5509000	They just go boom up, but they're placed over different diamonds.
5509000	5513000	I have a whole series of video and pictures of these. We don't have time to go through.
5513000	5526000	And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.
5527000	5539000	I myself have covered extensively the legends of Tehan and rumors of an enormous underground installation connecting Tehan to Edwards, China Lake, and myriad UFO legacy program sites.
5539000	5543000	Go watch my video on Dumbs or Northrop to learn more there.
5543000	5552000	We study Tehan in Hellendale because of the artwork of forensic artist Bill MacDonald in his 1992 piece Tohachapi Triangle.
5552000	5559000	MacDonald met with four old engineers at the Denny's and Antelope Valley in the spring of 1992.
5559000	5566000	Two of the engineers hailed from Lockheed Hellendale RCS plants and two hailed from Northrop Tehan RCS plants.
5566000	5576000	Fed up with the security, quote unquote, impositions that affected their quality of life and the locations at which they were required to live out a significant portion of their lives.
5576000	5583000	The engineers dictated a craft they had designed and constructed called the XF-131 Supercentinal.
5583000	5595000	As I have said before, MacDonald was then contacted by Chris Carter of the X-Files to include the very real XF-131 in Season 1, Episode 1 of the X-Files.
5595000	5605000	I have talked to MacDonald personally, attempting to contact these engineers, but MacDonald is unwilling to reveal their identities and I respect his decision.
5606000	5623000	Could, less likely in my opinion, instead of TR-3B, the triangular craft bin and XF-131 Supercentinal kept in the bowels of Tehan or Hellendale that saw regular test flights over R2508 with pilots from the AFFTC.
5623000	5639000	That was called to action by NAWDC and NASLAMOR to conduct test operations in the Haunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, aiming to get ARV teams on ground, undetected in areas populated by blue forces.
5639000	5651000	I do, lastly, want to tie everything to Castle being contacted by Wackenhut in 2002.
5651000	5662000	When the security contractor attempted to recruit Castle into their helicopter teams, Castle remarked to me how bizarre it was, Wackenhut seemingly knew everything about him.
5663000	5671000	But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt, if nothing else, it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset.
5671000	5678000	Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters.
5678000	5689000	They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1s, Cobra's, Super Cobra's.
5689000	5692000	And this leads me to a theory I'd like to propose.
5692000	5711000	This theory says that the team Castle encountered in 1997 was not Air Force or Navy enlisted personnel, JSOC or Joint Special Operations Command or SOCOM Special Operations Command teams, but instead a private team from Wackenhut working with the Navy and Air Force.
5711000	5722000	In this theory, in 2002, Wackenhut attempted to recruit Castle to these clandestine teams, possibly to a group like the infamous quote-unquote Blue Boys.
5722000	5731000	Alleged UFO crash retrieval rapid response teams operating from within US military bases employing helicopter units.
5731000	5742000	As I stated earlier, Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security, for many US DoD and Department of Energy installations.
5742000	5750000	And these included the Nevada test site, the Ever Elusive Groom Lake Area 51, and Los Alamos National Labs.
5750000	5756000	And additionally, Wackenhut allegedly served as a CIA front in the Cold War and beyond.
5756000	5767000	A theory likely proven in the JFK files in a released March 1963 memo detailing the Wackenhut Corporation wishing to serve as cover for the CIA.
5767000	5772000	Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank excellent researcher Blocked Epistemology for this find.
5772000	5782000	In the 1989 book The Terrorism Industry by Edward S. Herman, the board of Wackenhut and connections to US intelligence agencies was scrutinized.
5782000	5797000	Remember how in my SAIC video, I referred to SAIC by its nickname, NSA West, as so many US DoD and intelligence officials traded their stars and stripes in for business suits at SAIC.
5797000	5805000	It seems that Wackenhut operated as a similar revolving door for accomplished military and intelligence professionals.
5805000	5815000	In his book, Herman discussed how two figures I've associated with UFO legacy program operations in the past served on the board of Wackenhut in the 1980s.
5815000	5828000	And this is not to mention Bobby Ray Inman, a pillar stone of US intelligence, SAIC, and Wackenhut, I believe is one of the most key members to UFO programs in history.
5828000	5842000	One such figure mentioned by Herman was Frank Carlucci, US Secretary of Defense, and an individual I wagered may have been alongside Brad Sorenson to the classified section of the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show,
5842000	5846000	where flux liner alien reproduction vehicles were observed.
5846000	5858000	Additionally on the Wackenhut board was William F. Raybourne, who also served on the board of SAIC and was also the director of the Polaris Summary Program in the US Navy.
5858000	5871000	Navy Chief Scientist of Special Projects, John Pena Craven, stated he was ordered to carry out the Deep Submergence Systems project to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform deep ocean engineering.
5871000	5883000	To satisfy the whims of one project's sand dollar, a project that had cataloged every item of US national security interest resting on the sea floor tagged for retrieval.
5883000	5894000	According to Craven, this program was nestled within another program, nestled within another, itself hidden within another program nestled under the Polaris Summary Program.
5894000	5904000	To understand why I made the case sand dollar involved undersea UFO crash retrieval, go watch my US Navy Legacy Operations video.
5904000	5916000	In my video on Jonathan Weigandt, I proposed a theory that the UFO crash retrieval team were Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy Special Response teams or SRTs.
5916000	5926000	But overall wager, the crash retrieval team was more likely nearby US Army Green Berets recruited as special mission unit for USAT procedures.
5926000	5935000	But let's talk a little bit about SRT. This anti-nuclear terrorism team is the DOE's own elite task force.
5935000	5952000	An elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across the United States, the special response team has arrest on site authority and at least in the 1980s donned all black outfits and gear similar to the outfits described by CASEL.
5952000	5965000	Historically, in the late 90s, DOE SRT units also provided security for sensitive DOE defense nuclear facilities including Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs.
5965000	5970000	These DOE SRT teams were trained by Wackenhut.
5970000	5980000	And not just trained by Wackenhut, but these elite, highly capable DOE SRTs were comprised of Wackenhut employees.
5980000	5989000	According to the General Accounting Office, beginning in 1987, Wackenhut subcontracted Department of Energy Guard Services, not only A,
5989000	5996000	controlled access to sites, conducting roving patrols of site perimeters and responded to physical security alarms,
5996000	6002000	B, conducted property searches and inspections of facilities, personnel, and vehicles,
6002000	6009000	and C, provided protection for classified and unclassified documents and other government property and facilities,
6009000	6016000	but also that Wackenhut provided special response teams to act at the behest of the DOE.
6016000	6031000	SRTs are really no joke. These individuals are the ultimate Department of Energy, INDUSEC, or industrial security team entrusted with transporting nuclear materials around the continental United States.
6031000	6044000	One of the reasons I suspected Wackenhut DOE SRT was not involved in Wagan's case is because SRTs historically have acted within the continental United States, not abroad.
6044000	6053000	After all, these Wackenhut trained and staffed teams do have arrest authority in quote-unquote recovery operations on U.S. soil.
6053000	6063000	So, what if the Special Mission Unit, accompanying the Triangle during Hunter Warrior, was indeed a Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy SRT
6063000	6073000	that acted parallel to CASEL, who was busy and dutifully engaging in USMC AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval exercises?
6073000	6087000	This clandestine SRT unit instead operated alongside Navy and Air Force ARV programs, engaged in UFO crash retrieval exercises within the continental United States.
6087000	6099000	When investigating the case of Jonathan Waganth, I arrived to the conclusion based off of several lines of thinking the on-site scientific team securing the UFO crash site was DOE NEST,
6099000	6111000	or DOE Nuclear Emergency Response Team. Part of my rationale here is the fact DOE NEST's governing authority is the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement.
6111000	6126000	The Schumer Rounds UFO legislation called the UAPDA references this 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement as a system leverage to improperly classify UFO materials, hardware, biologics, etc.
6126000	6138000	as, quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear information, end quote. This same logic here for Waganth and DOE NEST applies to CASEL and DOE SRT.
6138000	6160000	If SRT units, formally trained and staffed by Waganthut, are indeed conducting domestic UFO crash retrieval operations, just as with NEST, the DOE could likely leverage the same 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement to effectively black hole any UFO retrieval operations, recovered materials, etc.
6161000	6174000	I myself have personally heard rumors from sources of UFO crashes being transported across the continental United States, haphazardly labeled nuclear material and guarded by SRT.
6174000	6198000	After all, if UFO materials are indeed obfuscated under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act as trans-classified foreign nuclear information, which I fully believe it does, does it not make perfect sense highly trained DOE SRTs entrusted with transporting U.S. nuclear materials and weapons would be the same operators to transport recovered craft?
6198000	6216000	If this team observed by CASEL was indeed Waganthut, this wouldn't be the first time Waganthut suffered such a folly. Meet Richard Mingus, a federal services security guard at the Nevada Test Site from 1957 to 1953, who often times worked at Area 51.
6216000	6228000	In 1982, Mingus was securing an underground nuclear test area at Area 6 on the Nevada Test Site while the base featured a live nuclear bomb exposed above ground.
6229000	6237000	While lowering the bomb underground for explosives testing, the base at Area 6 quickly came under attack by armed combatants.
6238000	6249000	Mingus was primarily responsible for coordinating the breach of security up through the chain of command, all the way up to President Ronald Reagan as the event was a significant national security issue.
6249000	6258000	It was later determined the men attacking were simply conducting a drill from where else but Waganthut.
6279000	6295000	In late April, early March, if this was late April, I believe this was the last one or two days of April into early March, and this is the time that he actually reached out to David Grush and expressed his willingness and desire to both testify to and deliver his testimony to Congress.
6295000	6311000	Now, I'm recording this video, this outro, on August 2025, so I believe it was late July, there was an image floating around Twitter and so forth in UFO circles of Castle pictured with Stephen Greer, Eric Burleson, Michael Herrera, and others.
6311000	6321000	And this is because after he reached out to David Grush, he decided to also reach out to Stephen Greer, and of course Stephen Greer brought him to Representative Burleson and so forth.
6321000	6335000	Now, I had, like I said, I had known about Mr. Castle long before then, before that image, before that trip, I just had not made the introduction to him, reached out to him, I was still in the process of researching his history and vetting him.
6335000	6340000	We talk about that a little more in our full interview, but let's start to break things down.
6340000	6348000	Now, distinct thing here, a lot of people are trying to delineate between the term whistleblower and witness, and I think we did that in this video.
6348000	6359000	Mr. Castle isn't necessarily a whistleblower, but he is indeed a witness, and as we demonstrate in this video, what he witnessed is not as simple as seeing a craft.
6359000	6369000	You know, there are plenty of stories from USMC vets, Army vets, Air Force vets, Navy vets who have seen Tic Tac craft, who have seen craft close to the bow of their ships and so forth.
6369000	6379000	What Mr. Castle saw was what eye wager is an alien reproduction vehicle, an accompanying black team, the same sort of team that both Wagant and Herrera saw.
6379000	6383000	This team armed in all black featured US Army helmets featured.
6383000	6390000	You know, we try to tuck into the guns MP5 machine guns, not necessarily M16A4s or M4 carbines.
6390000	6399000	The presence of an MP5 for all the gun fans out there would imply that this is possibly, you know, not a standard military unit as we saw.
6399000	6407000	And one of the reasons why I led this was a PMC private military contractor SMU special mission unit out of Wackenhut.
6407000	6414000	And this is critical. These times are critical because this occurred mere weeks before the case of Wagant.
6414000	6422000	And one of the arguments I made that I had a lot of fun doing in this video was discussing, hey, maybe the way this team handled Castle,
6422000	6431000	maybe after they handled Castle because we know hit the black ops team just ran down the hill, drove back northwest to the direction of Edwards at the direction of R-2508.
6431000	6435000	Right after that, the team brutalized Wagant, detained him.
6435000	6444000	So I believe there might have been different sorts of safeguards put in place if the teams encountered blue units.
6444000	6453000	And possibly this was exactly why the Navy tacked on to Hunter Warrior in the very end as an adjunct and put in some ARV teams.
6453000	6459000	Now, before we break things down, I know I put out a big thesis on there in my post video rant.
6459000	6465000	I never read from a script, but let me go ahead and reread the thesis from which I constructed most of my arguments.
6465000	6469000	So we can have it all neatly recapped because I know we had an hour and 45 minutes.
6469000	6475000	So let's just go through that. I'll tell you when I'm starting and I'll tell you what I'm ending starting for my work in theory.
6475000	6487000	March 2nd to roughly March 14th, 1997 saw the execution of Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiments that involved the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, 29 Palms, California.
6487000	6490000	The experiment was designed to examine three specific areas.
6490000	6497000	The Center for Naval Analysis published summaries of the findings alongside the Marines by 1 August 1997.
6497000	6504000	Having previously expressed interest in carrier tactical aviation involvement in supporting troops offshore in 1995,
6504000	6511000	a report titled An Operational Examination of Sea-Based Aerial Fire Support for Troops Engaged was written by the Navy.
6511000	6516000	After recommendation of, and I'm going to skip over this guys because I know I read a little bit in the video,
6516000	6522000	but of Navy Admiral J. Johnson to the Marine Corps Commanding General, the Navy Nautic,
6522000	6527000	or what was previously known as the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada,
6527000	6535000	assembled air crews alongside the Naval Air Station in the Moore, California to explore Hunter Air concepts during Hunter Warrior,
6535000	6540000	which on the surface evaluated a wide variety of technologies and evolutionary tactics.
6540000	6547000	Involved naval experiments here, as we discussed, were considered adjunct, bolted on late in the planning stage.
6547000	6552000	Tying into Castle's encounter of the enormous floating triangle, an armed ground team,
6552000	6558000	Nautic and Nass, the Moore, engaged a Black Ops crash retrieval, or tactical team,
6558000	6566000	or special mission unit, SMU, in war game exercises to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc.,
6566000	6571000	alongside blue assets without detection, and obviously, due to Castle's encounter,
6571000	6575000	this directive failed and failed miserably.
6575000	6579000	Rational here can be extended to and pause. I know this is controversial,
6579000	6583000	but I did want to explore it because it is pretty intriguing to me,
6583000	6589000	and I'd like to do a little more poking around because as I stated, I have heard that there are human tic-tacs
6589000	6593000	and non-human tic-tacs, and I tend to agree with that sentiment.
6593000	6599000	I'm not staking my position or opinion in anywhere in the sand regarding Nimitz,
6599000	6603000	but I thought this was interesting to explore, anyways, back to the thesis.
6603000	6607000	Rational can be extended to the 2004 Nimitz tic-tac encounter.
6607000	6611000	If the tic-tac was indeed reverse-engineered technology from the Lockheed Skunk Works,
6611000	6617000	operating in restricted, active US Navy airspace, this draws parallels to Castle's experience.
6617000	6622000	As the tic-tac would have been conducting test missions, flights, etc. among blue assets,
6622000	6628000	possibly to gauge blue responses to such vehicles or approaching cap points without detection
6628000	6631000	or as little detection as possible.
6631000	6637000	Possible reason for this tic-tac testing on blue assets is to see reaction types,
6637000	6642000	time, speeds, methods of an unknowing force if there was enemy contact.
6642000	6645000	Warning the pilots beforehand taints the results.
6645000	6650000	Quick pause, I'm not advocating for anything or making claims, I'm just exploring this concept.
6650000	6656000	The Navy or other US entities would never test on their own pilots or servicemen,
6656000	6659000	some people claim, well, this is wrong, it's done every day.
6659000	6665000	Further parallels to Castle involve the late March, early April experience
6665000	6668000	of Lance Corporal Jonathan Waganth in the jungles of Peru.
6668000	6672000	By Castle's description, there is a hypothesis that could be made.
6672000	6676000	Castle encountered the same type of team Waganth encountered training,
6676000	6679000	working alongside blue assets without detection.
6679000	6682000	Of course, in both cases, such training failed.
6682000	6684000	Then this raises further questions.
6684000	6690000	In Waganth's testimony, if the DOE Ness team he encountered that arrived via CH-47s
6690000	6697000	was the team alongside the DOE Ness team, actually DOE SRT Wackenhut,
6697000	6701000	and I do want to pause here, and you know what, let's just throw away the script, guys.
6701000	6707000	This is the time we don't read from the script, so I do want to dive into Nautic and Nasslemore a little more.
6707000	6711000	But, you know, when I was reading the terrorism industry book,
6711000	6715000	and to learn more a little bit about the board of Wackenhut and some, you know,
6715000	6721000	various chairman that they had, including Bobby Ray Inman, including Frank Harlucci,
6721000	6723000	including Admiral William F. Raybourne,
6723000	6728000	I also saw in that book that in the late 80s, early 90s,
6728000	6733000	that Wackenhut had established fobs or forward operating bases
6733000	6737000	or places of business in specifically Peru.
6737000	6742000	So now I really want to re-engage the idea that possibly DOE SRTs
6742000	6744000	were the team that Waganth encountered as well.
6744000	6750000	This SRTs are, I don't have any evidence or sources to back this up,
6750000	6753000	but I am confident in that, in this hypothesis,
6753000	6757000	that the DOE SRT privately trained and staffed by Wackenhut
6757000	6760000	is what Castle encountered and now possibly Waganth.
6760000	6763000	And what strengthens this theory is the argument I made,
6763000	6768000	such as DOE Nest and such as so much in DOE and NNSA,
6768000	6772000	that the SRT team could fall back on the 1954 atomic energy agreement
6772000	6777000	to basically obfuscate any mission, any retrieval,
6777000	6780000	any operation they're doing, and this can be misclassified
6780000	6782000	as transclassified for in nuclear materials.
6782000	6786000	So there is no need to divulge any information to any entity
6786000	6788000	that does not have a strict need to know
6788000	6792000	or is not on the bigot list of the associated CAP USAP
6792000	6794000	or WAVED USAP.
6794000	6797000	Now, Nautic and Nassel Amour isn't that interesting.
6797000	6800000	I was so thrilled to build a thesis around this
6800000	6802000	and being able to see that Nautic and Nassel Amour
6802000	6805000	have their own sorts of triangle sightings.
6805000	6807000	That was pretty intriguing to me.
6807000	6809000	And then the tie-ins to Edwards.
6809000	6813000	Now, where were these craft stationed?
6813000	6817000	There is an argument to be made that Nassel Amour held the craft,
6817000	6820000	that Nautic held the craft, that Edwards held the craft,
6820000	6823000	but I do think it is quite plausible.
6823000	6827000	And in my opinion, likely that this program operated
6827000	6830000	between Navy and Air Force out of these three locations
6830000	6832000	and possibly China Lake.
6832000	6836000	Fallon, Nevada is interesting as this is quite close to Area 51
6836000	6840000	and the Fallon Test Range is quite close to the Nevada Test Range.
6840000	6843000	Anybody who's watched my videos and Jesse Michaels as well,
6843000	6845000	hey, I'm rep at his merch.
6845000	6847000	We'll know the story of Randy Anderson who claimed
6847000	6851000	while doing test stops out at Area 51 Auxiliary sites
6851000	6853000	on land owned by the Department of Energy,
6853000	6857000	he himself has come across electric-ovidic triangle craft
6857000	6859000	that the US hasn't stored.
6859000	6861000	Now, also near Fallon, Nevada,
6861000	6864000	Nautic is a Newark Keyport location
6864000	6868000	that is supposedly a depot for underground mine storage.
6868000	6871000	Now, if you watched my, I think it was SAIC or US Navy video,
6871000	6876000	I talked about Newark Keyport as being almost a data acquisition type entity
6876000	6878000	within US Navy legacy program operation.
6878000	6881000	So that is something to chase down as well.
6881000	6884000	As far as pilots here, we know that the triangle craft,
6884000	6886000	if we're relegating this to TR3B,
6886000	6889000	that according to Fouche that the pilots come out of the AFFTC,
6889000	6891000	the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center
6891000	6894000	and the Air Force Test Pilot School out of Edwards,
6894000	6897000	and we know from Ed, or at least I know from Ed,
6897000	6901000	that this is indeed a place where I believe
6901000	6907000	with extremely high certainty that elements of the 412th Test Wing
6907000	6911000	and Edwards and likely various Air Force MRTFBs
6911000	6913000	including the Utah Test and Training Range,
6913000	6919000	Nevada Test and Training Range collaborate to test flight ARV.
6919000	6921000	Now, I know what Fouche said,
6921000	6924000	that these were test pilots from the Navy and Air Force
6924000	6928000	and I know, guys, I know Nautic Top Gun is not a test pilot school,
6928000	6930000	this is an active fighter school.
6930000	6933000	The Navy's test pilot school is actually out at PAX River,
6933000	6936000	which is interesting as well, that's another interesting connection.
6936000	6939000	But quite intriguing that Castle's testimony,
6939000	6941000	especially with a craft going Northwest
6941000	6944000	and the team going Northwest into R-2508 airspace,
6944000	6947000	ties into Edwards and Edwards Restricted Ranges
6947000	6950000	when we also know that Nautic and National Moor had involvement as well.
6950000	6954000	So, the reason I think this craft is an alien reproduction vehicle
6954000	6958000	is because of the team associated that Castle encountered
6958000	6961000	and because of just some of the characteristics of the craft.
6961000	6964000	I know that Kuzlowski and Phillips out of Arrow
6964000	6967000	have begun recently talking about triangular craft
6967000	6970000	and these being advanced human platforms and I do agree with that
6970000	6973000	and I am still of the mind that some of these triangular craft
6973000	6976000	are alien reproduction vehicles in the sense that
6976000	6980000	Fouche is right that their propulsion systems are based off of non-human technology
6980000	6984000	or perhaps other aspects of their propulsion, their survivability,
6984000	6987000	their mass reduction, their internal mass reduction,
6987000	6990000	various aspects have been leveraged from non-human sources.
6990000	6994000	I think it is intriguing and I think that from Castle's description
6994000	6997000	it sounds like what he saw was TR-3B.
6997000	7000000	Guys, I hope you appreciate those renders we have in this video.
7000000	7002000	I think they are wicked cool.
7002000	7005000	But remember, Castle only saw the underside of the craft in part of the side
7005000	7009000	so he did not see the top of the craft so we left the top blank.
7009000	7014000	No features there, not like the TR-3B with the raised crew compartment in the middle
7014000	7016000	because we do not know what was up there.
7016000	7020000	What is interesting and what kind of takes me back to TR-3B
7020000	7022000	is the concave section in the middle
7022000	7025000	and if you actually look at Sal Paese's patents
7025000	7028000	out of, not associated with, but out of Pax River,
7028000	7031000	I think this was in 2017 for inertial mass reduction craft,
7031000	7034000	you'll see a triangle with a large concave center as well,
7034000	7037000	interesting tie-in and of course Castle talks about the ridges
7037000	7039000	in between the lights of the triangle
7039000	7041000	and that reminds me closely of TR-3B as well.
7041000	7044000	One of the things we have to pay attention to what Castle said
7044000	7047000	is the lights on each vertex weren't just flush lights or recess lights,
7047000	7051000	these almost seemed like orbs embedded in the triangle
7051000	7054000	and these gave off a whitish, yellowish, goldish color
7054000	7057000	but did not cast light in the surrounding area.
7057000	7059000	There's so much to chew through here guys,
7059000	7064000	so much awesome stuff that relates to so much of what I've talked about
7064000	7067000	on my channel and so much in UFO lore.
7067000	7071000	So, I will be releasing the Castle interview soon,
7071000	7074000	we talk a lot more, we talk about the anthrax vaccine,
7074000	7077000	we talk about the other marines specifically
7077000	7078000	because I know what you're thinking,
7078000	7080000	there are multiple other marines with Castle
7080000	7083000	and also behind the scenes we're trying to track down these marines
7083000	7086000	to talk to them as well.
7086000	7089000	You know, part of the issue with cases like Wageance
7089000	7092000	and Michael Herreras is we can't necessarily pin down
7092000	7096000	exactly where this event happened, you know, in Sumatra, Indonesia
7096000	7099000	or in Wageance case, even if it was northern, southern Peru,
7099000	7101000	if it relates to Bukalpa, where,
7101000	7103000	but what is interesting here with Castle
7103000	7107000	is we do know that within just a couple mile radius
7107000	7110000	of Emerson Dry Lakebed, this is where this encounter happened
7110000	7113000	and we know the exact direction in which the craft
7113000	7116000	and the team departed.
7116000	7118000	So, there's a lot more to true through
7118000	7120000	and a lot of interesting things to follow up on.
7120000	7122000	Again, that interview will come out soon.
7122000	7126000	I actually went out to where Mr. Castle lives,
7126000	7129000	spent a couple days with him and we were courted out there.
7129000	7131000	So, wonderful things to say about the man,
7131000	7133000	he's been all but gracious.
7133000	7135000	Same with other witnesses I've talked to,
7135000	7138000	before we started talking, he was incredibly nervous,
7138000	7140000	incredibly nervous.
7140000	7142000	But we spent some time together, he started to open up
7142000	7145000	and the man was a joy to talk to
7145000	7149000	and I hope to get him back in front of some congressmen.
7149000	7151000	I'd like to be there with him maybe
7151000	7154000	and maybe we can present his testimony and this thesis together
7154000	7157000	to maybe Rep Burleson or someone similar,
7157000	7159000	but that is what I would like to do next.
7159000	7162000	Some bookkeeping stuff, guys.
7162000	7164000	There's been a lot of buzz about the Danny Jones
7164000	7166000	and Chris Ramsey podcasts.
7166000	7169000	Those have had an insane amount of views
7169000	7171000	and it's a true honor that each of you guys
7171000	7173000	watch that and support this channel.
7173000	7175000	There's so many new viewers to this channel,
7175000	7178000	I think we've got almost 20,000 from those two interviews.
7178000	7181000	So, if you're new to this channel, I love you.
7181000	7183000	If you are a longtime viewer of this channel,
7183000	7185000	I also love you.
7185000	7187000	In the comments all the time, I see so many people
7187000	7190000	that have been with me leaving comments since day one,
7190000	7194000	since I had 20 subscribers, 30 subscribers,
7194000	7196000	names that come to mind.
7196000	7198000	Mighty Mo, Tanner Johnson, Birdie606.
7198000	7200000	So, a lot of you guys I recognize
7200000	7202000	and I appreciate each and every one of you.

7205000	7207000	I would love if you support the channel.
7207000	7209000	That's how I fund these trips.
7209000	7211000	That's how I fund the 3D designers
7211000	7213000	and that's how I keep my channel going.
7213000	7215000	I don't gatekeep content,
7215000	7218000	so please just support what you think the channel is worth.

7221000	7223000	and if you don't want to support on Patreon,
7223000	7226000	at least give this video a like, a comment,
7226000	7228000	and subscribe to the channel.
7228000	7230000	I think every YouTuber says this,
7230000	7233000	but it actually does help quite a bit.
7233000	7235000	But I appreciate everybody being here
7235000	7237000	and if you watch the end here, thank you so much.
7237000	7239000	I got some exciting stuff coming down the corners.
7239000	7241000	We got some hearings coming up in September.
7241000	7242000	I think we have a date for that.
7242000	7244000	I will be there for that
7244000	7246000	and I know I haven't done it in a long time,
7246000	7248000	but I think I will do a live stream before
7248000	7250000	and after the hearings
7250000	7252000	and I will be there for a lot of fun.
7252000	7254000	I will be boots on the ground for that.
7254000	7256000	Remember, I got a Patreon support the channel.
7256000	7258000	Like and subscribe.
7258000	7261000	I will catch everybody on the next episode.
7261000	7264000	I'm trying to think if there is anything else I missed.
7264000	7266000	Yes, there is.
7266000	7268000	Randy Anderson talked about Area 51
7268000	7270000	and seeing triangles there.
7270000	7272000	I also have my friend, the Army Public Affairs Officer,
7272000	7274000	who was at Area 51 at Groom Lake
7274000	7276000	who on the cleared flight line
7276000	7278000	when he was with some active colonels there,
7278000	7280000	saw a triangle take off vertically
7280000	7282000	at incomprehensible speeds,
7282000	7284000	making no sounds, not disturbing any of the dust around it.
7284000	7286000	I think I talked about that on Danny Jones,
7286000	7288000	but I just remember that now.
7288000	7290000	We will wrap that up today.
7290000	7292000	I think we are approaching on two hours.
7292000	7294000	With that being said, guys,
7294000	7296000	thank you everybody for joining me
7296000	7298000	and thank you for supporting Mr. Castle.
7298000	7300000	I will link his Twitter down below.
7300000	7302000	He is a great guy.
7302000	7304000	Feel free to talk to him.
7304000	7306000	I appreciate his courage coming out
7306000	7308000	and thank you so much for watching.
7308000	7310000	Catch everybody next time. Bye.
