0	10000	Okay.
10000	20000	What?
20000	38000	All right. I think we're live. Let me see. Let's check on the phone.
38000	41000	What up, Martin? How you doing, man? We are live. Awesome.
41000	44000	What up, Brandon? How you doing, man? What are you guys up to?
44000	47000	I'm going to wait for some people to filter in,
47000	55000	and then I kind of wanted to touch on some of the new interests around the Wilson Davis document and the fat rodents Chaco Martin.
55000	59000	What's up? Hey, guys. So, yeah, we'll just wait for a couple people to filter in.
59000	67000	We'll talk about the new Wilson Davis revelations because I also really want to touch on what Eric Davis said.
67000	72000	And I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of that. And then the Ross Colt Hart AMA. I found it pretty interesting.
72000	82000	Yeah, I kind of want to review two possible sources of that 2004 JSOC on program action.
82000	86000	What's up, Bertie? I don't know if I've seen you in lives before. So what's going on?
86000	96000	While we're gearing up, I do want to talk about if everybody can just keep Mr. Ryan Wood in their minds.
96000	102000	As you guys probably learned about two days ago, Dr. Robert Wood has passed on.
102000	113000	I know recently he suffered some sort of medical complications, and I know talking with Ryan, I think his father's passing came as somewhat of a surprise.
113000	121000	So if you can keep him in your mind, and if you guys can let me know if you've watched Dr. Robert Wood's video on the DPI,
121000	128000	but in Stephen Greer's 2001 kind of video set, you can find it on SiriusDisclosure.com.
128000	135000	I highly recommend watching that as kind of Ryan touched on the video as a McDonnell Douglas aircraft rocket scientist.
135000	140000	Actually, this man was incredibly accomplished. He kind of talked to his superiors.
140000	146000	When are we going to figure out gravity manipulation technology before Lockheed Martin does?
146000	152000	And he was given a task, met up with Stanton Friedman, but was basically denied access.
152000	156000	So he was a big friend of Stanton Friedman. Let's go through some of these questions and so forth.
156000	162000	Bertie, yes, almost 10k. Hope so soon, man. That'd be awesome. I can't believe this. I started this channel out.
162000	168000	Maybe we'll talk about the origins of the channel a little bit. This is actually quite funny. Let me go through this.
168000	172000	Will O'Malley retain? Yes, he's going to knock Marabba out in the early rounds.
172000	177000	And then if Taporio beats, I don't even want to hear it. This man still should be champ.
177000	183000	If Taporio beats Holloway, which I don't think he will, I'd like to see O'Malley knock out Taporio.
183000	190000	What's up, Quitter? Bertie? Yes, sir. Hey, and Cody, thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.
190000	194000	But what's the most compelling evidence? Yeah, let's talk about that too.
194000	202000	Real fast about Mr. Robert Wood. Ryan, actually, when he and I met, because before we did our video online,
202000	206000	he and I actually had met up in person because he lives quite close to me in Colorado.
206000	211000	I shared a coffee talk for like three and a half hours. I'm so gracious for his time.
211000	220000	He has a lot of interest in kind of the gravity manipulation research that Ross Colthart has talked about stemming from the 50s and so on.
220000	223000	So I hope to have Ryan back on about that sort of project.
223000	229000	There's a really good article, and I believe the drive about the 50s gravity manipulation studies.
229000	237000	So I'll also link that. But what's the most compelling piece of evidence the MJ12 docs are real?
237000	245000	I might say the surrounding the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman Forest Hall memo, the Cutler Twining memo,
245000	249000	and Nathan Twining's White Hot Report. I think those are very interesting.
249000	253000	There's so much good information around the Eisenhower briefing document.
253000	258000	I want to return to the Majestic 12 as well soon. I know you guys are familiar with Grant Cameron.
258000	261000	We'll talk about him in a little bit as we discuss the Wilson Davis memo.
261000	268000	In his files with UFO researcher Bill Moore, I've actually found some new Majestic documents I've never seen before, dated to the 80s.
268000	277000	So maybe in a little bit when I share my screen and we go through some stuff, we'll throw that up too, because this specific Majestic documents talks about EBEs.
277000	283000	So, you know, I don't know if you guys back earlier this year, Grant Cameron released his files.
283000	291000	I highly recommend going through those. Maybe I can link them, including a big file set on the current project I'm working at, hoping to get out this week.
291000	299000	We do have the, you know what, now that you mentioned that, of course we have Ben Rich, but now we have Dr. Jim Ryder, as mentioned in imminent, and Lou Elizondo.
299000	305000	So Dr. Jim Ryder, I've actually been kind of looking into him a little bit behind the scenes with a couple of my friends.
305000	311000	He was in the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center or Division, ATC Advanced Technology Center.
311000	318000	On Lockheed's media stories, there are only ever two, there have only ever been two documents surrounding Dr. Jim Ryder.
318000	324000	One of which was, one of which was a press release on some carbon nanotube material.
324000	330000	And another one was on, another one was on, sorry, I'm trying to remember.
330000	339000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center and a deal with DARPA to make a more substantial satellite network.
339000	345000	I've been here, I know, Brady, you've been here since day one, man. I remember the first video I ever put out had the Wilson Davis video.
345000	352000	We had like, I remember I was counting up the views on that every time I'd see one of the extra view and I'd get so happy.
352000	360000	I am so sick of all these guys with the shady behind the scenes stories we need to hear and subpoena all these characters like Davis and put off, make them testify.
360000	363000	So all these rumors once and for all, I agree with that in terms of Eric Davis.
363000	367000	He seems to be very selective when he likes to weigh in about the phenomenon and so forth.
367000	375000	Eric Davis will stay quiet for a very extended period of time and then just come online to say that Lou Elizondo is fooey and something like that.
375000	381000	I'd like to hear more about him and as we'll talk about in a little bit, it's interesting to hear him comment on the Wilson Davis memo.
381000	390000	You know, even in his comment, there's some stuff that, you know, at least talking to James Rigney, the man who kind of brought the memo to Grant Cameron is a little inaccurate.
390000	393000	So I would like to see Eric Davis subpoenaed.
393000	398000	Jimmy Shoe, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I really appreciate that.
398000	403000	How do you think the Lockheed team killed the JSEC guys training or exotic equipment?
403000	410000	Well, we will dive into that in just a little bit because as you know, I think a lot of this is getting connected with John Stewart and his supposed 2023.
410000	414000	I think it was December 2023, but I have the files up. We'll go through it on the screen.
414000	417000	We'll actually go through the whole exchange that John Stewart posted.
417000	428000	But remember, remember this, remember Michael Herrera's insider submitted a document that was supposed to be a play on Dobser similar to secret machines by Tom DeLonge.
428000	440000	This manuscript called Sentinels of Ether covers a blue on blue black program team killing JSEC members in 2004 in none other than Koyame, Mexico with conventional weaponry.
440000	443000	So we'll talk about that.
443000	445000	Yeah.
445000	451000	So there was an experimental in the submarine in the fifties or sixties that used magnetic fields to operate and wasn't a classified project.
451000	457000	I haven't heard of that T hammer. If you have a link, I would really, really like to go into that.
458000	461000	You like that, pal? I know you like that.
461000	468000	My lady got that for me. It's signed by Volk and everything. So that was a true treat to get and this is going to be the centerpiece.
468000	475000	I have a couple of other things to hang up. I got a Joey made me a custom printed logo. I need to get that up and have another Bob reactor drawing.
475000	481000	And of course, I have the framed Michael drawing. I got to get up Michael Herrera's when he drew the ARV.
481000	483000	So I need to get get that up.
483000	487000	Will you ever do a video? Yeah, absolutely. I read the 4chan whistleblower a lot.
487000	501000	Any of you guys who aren't familiar with that, the crux of his argument or testimony is that deep underwater, there is a basically purpose built UAP production craft hamburger shaped.
501000	503000	I believe it is. It's enormous.
503000	514000	And apparently this builds UAP to spec and part of the reason that UAP is crash, according to this man's testimony is this this custom specking machine doesn't really care what happens to the to the craft.
514000	519000	So yeah, I actually really want to go through that line by line by line because there's so much interesting stuff there.
519000	527000	Everything from talking about orbs and how he says the underlying structure behind these orbs people see is almost like a like a hammer shape, right?
527000	530000	If you if you've read that to the underground basis, he touches on implants.
530000	534000	And of course, implants are kind of the big ticket item now with Lou commenting on them.
534000	537000	Then speaking of Lou, what are you guys thinking of imminent?
537000	541000	I still haven't read it yet, if I'm being honest, I got a lot of other projects I'm working on.
541000	545000	I do hope to talk to Lou soon.
545000	555000	So if that's the case, you guys, my community, let's bump heads and let's figure out how to talk to him different than all of these from his Joe Rogan appearance to his all of his other appearances just talking about imminent
555000	557000	and kind of the atyp all that stuff.
557000	560000	I would like to dig into the origins of that a little bit more if I talked to him.
560000	563000	And I would also like to talk more about crash retrievals and so forth.
563000	572000	Of course, in imminent, he talks about the December 6, I mean, December 1950 crash retrieval near El Indio Guerrera near Del Rio, Texas.
572000	576000	Those of you will know that that is only mentioned in the Eisenhower briefing document.
576000	584000	So that could be a huge validating piece of the majestic documents to find out a little bit more about that case.
585000	590000	So signed by Volk. Yes, it is. And bought by your lady. Yes, it is.
590000	601000	We are a Volkanovsky household. She knows that whenever it's time for Volk to fight that I'll need complete silence because if he loses, which he hasn't because anytime he's lost, it's been CGI.
601000	603000	I'll have a mental breakdown.
603000	606000	So Snapple, how did you, how did I not find your channel before?
606000	608000	Insanely, I appreciate that. I really appreciate that.
608000	611000	We're still early, man. We're still just starting up.
611000	617000	I think first video was in mid to late January and that was on the Wilson Davis memo, which is very timely.
617000	627000	If you've watched that video, I think I was extremely ill when I made it, had a nasty cold and was working on a like $10 Amazon mic.
627000	631000	So it sounds horrendous. I don't think there's any music or real production value.
631000	633000	I don't think I showed my face in that.
633000	645000	So, you know, maybe at a year, we'll revisit that topic and get a, get a bigger type of analysis on the Wilson Davis need to dive more into Lou's relationship with Bigelow.
645000	654000	Yes. And Bigelow's plan to receive materials given from Lockheed Martin as highlighted in Kona Blue.
654000	662000	So I think that's a great one. If any of you guys have questions, so I'm not saying anything set in stone, but if I get to talk to Lou, if you guys have questions that
662000	667000	branch out a little bit from his regular media appearances, let me know and I'll kind of factor that in.
667000	671000	Again, if you weren't here yet, I do plan to talk more about crash retrievals.
671000	681000	I sent you a Gmail. Are you possibly, I'm super behind on my emails. I'm sorry, guys. I have so many to go through and I try to respond to each one very thoughtfully.
681000	684000	So if I haven't read your email yet, I promise I'm getting through the list. I'm so sorry.
685000	692000	I know a lot of other productions have like a team or moderators. It's just me on this and that's kind of how I liked it.
692000	697000	I want to make sure I interface and speak to everybody here what they have to say. So if I'm behind, I'm very sorry, guys.
697000	703000	Big dog. Hey, Lou, did MJ12? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to ask him straight up.
703000	708000	I know Lou likes to answer questions he can't talk about in a bit of a roundabout way.
708000	714000	I don't really kind of confirm or deny anything or even give the classic intelligence line like I can't comment on that.
714000	720000	So I would like to figure some good ways to structure subjects such as that.
720000	724000	A Volk poster. Your girl have a sister.
724000	730000	Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Spectre you the man. Thank you very much.
730000	733000	Volk should have been double champ. Pride rules.
733000	742000	Don't get me started on that. Let's see the difference between Volk and Islam in the fifth round and the second fight with CGI.
742000	748000	Is there any known case of a UAP crash in 2004? I know that I know there is the Tic Tac case, but that's not a crash.
748000	758000	That is a good question. And like we'll talk about we have two origins and two kind of stories surrounding the 2004 JSOC team.
758000	769000	In John Stewart's source, they talk about a crash retrieval in the Sentinels of Ether story. It talks about trafficking humans.
769000	780000	So I'm not quite sure. But I again, I'd like to pay attention to the Sentinels of Ether because remember that location in which this event takes place.
780000	793000	Kuyama, Mexico. And we have covered a case with a story of a team that a Mexican national military team that died trying to transport the vehicle.
793000	799000	It does. I hope I've answered. Yes, I have answered your priority. I'm very sorry if I'm slow on them.
799000	808000	So Pina Davis put off Elizondo Sheehan, Nell Mellon. I think Nell is one of the most interesting people to talk to about this topic.
808000	814000	I have myself, I've spoken to Chris Mellon a few times. I tried to invite him on for an interview. He had to decline for the moment.
814000	818000	Hopefully we can get that in the future. I would really like to hear more from Chris Mellon.
818000	827000	So do you have any comment on Hans Kamler? He was in charge of the Nazi secret weapon and only was recently revealed, was taken into custody after US custody.
827000	838000	Yeah, where did, hold on, where did I hear that? I was talking to somebody. Yes, I was talking to somebody about this in terms of.
838000	843000	Yeah, I was talking to a friend about this, that there are some documents stating that Kamler was actually alive.
843000	855000	I think this relates to a supposed Nazi base that was explored post-World War II near the Czech Republic that was revisited about 40 years later.
855000	858000	I have to check my notes on that, but that is ringing a bell.
858000	863000	Andrea, I love your videos. I've got my mom on to them. Thank you. I hope your mom enjoys them.
863000	871000	Structure question. Lou, if someone kept D, I don't know, any alleged recoveries during his tenure with ATIP?
871000	878000	Yes, that's actually a great question. The only one I can really think of is the 2008 Needles, California crash.
878000	887000	And that would of course be right at the time he has joined ATIP. That is a case that was covered by George Knapp.
887000	897000	I would like to cover that in the future. There's not a ton around that case, but I know George Knapp in his reporting commented on some really interesting kind of military presence around that time.
897000	903000	Again, if you haven't heard of that case, it's Needles, California 2008, and I will cover that.
903000	908000	Toby Milo, thank you so much. Would love to see a collab with you and Lou or you and Ross.
908000	916000	Love to see Michael back. Tim Gallaudet likes your stuff. Have him on. Ross is still that dude. I'll tell you that much.
916000	923000	I've reached out to Timothy Gallaudet. He is not doing interviews at the moment, maybe in the future. I'd like to have Lou on.
923000	928000	I'd love to talk to Ross. And with Michael, I'm still investigating his case.
928000	933000	So if there's new stuff to cover, of course, I'd love to talk to Michael again.
933000	937000	Mrs. Floyd, thank you so much. I really appreciate that.
937000	940000	And if young Hannah is watching, tell her I say hi.
940000	946000	MJ12, reworded question. If someone wants to keep digging on MJ12, would they eventually hit pay dirt one way or another?
946000	954000	Good way to put it. I like that. I like that. All right. Peps per-speak cautious.
955000	957000	I can't. You guys know I can't speak.
957000	964000	Did you hear anything from the insider who manages multiple use up facilities about using PLFs and psychotronics to fake alien abductions and blame them on ETs?
964000	973000	No, no, I did not. But however, referencing the Stephen Greer DPI archive, there is witness.
973000	975000	Let's see if I can get this out of my head. 10892.
975000	983000	10892 that talks about being on a retrieval team at Nellis observing a sunflower shaped NHI craft that had landed
983000	988000	and also fake PLF. If you guys don't know what a PLF is, that's a programmable life form.
988000	1000000	This person in the DPI archive number 10892 alleges that after his time on a retrieval team, he encountered a programmable life form in a fake abduction.
1000000	1009000	I have all of those files downloaded because we know Stephen Greer in OPSEC, so I don't know if those operational security, I don't know if those files are going to be taken down.
1009000	1014000	But so I would like to dive into that case and give it its due diligence.
1014000	1017000	The documents came out in 2021 that show Hans Kemler was taken into custody.
1017000	1023000	The OSS agent who took him into US custody said to his son, Kemler had knowledge of weapons that influenced the Cold War in future.
1023000	1025000	Yes, and that was the correct me if I'm wrong.
1025000	1035000	And if you're on this subject, that was the location in the Czech Republic where the Nazis supposedly stored some art precious cardio and possibly weaponry.
1035000	1039000	Well, I do a video on the UAP DA closer to December.
1039000	1052000	Yeah, I probably should at this point seen as I reference it almost every video, especially the line about legacy programs, the 1954 Atomic Energy Act and classifying UAP materials as trans classified for nuclear materials.
1052000	1055000	So I would like to do that.
1055000	1058000	Is the control group headed from NATO outside US?
1059000	1063000	That's a good question. There is a lot of there's a lot of interesting
1063000	1071000	roots to go down to say that the control group handling the UAP issue issue isn't necessarily tied to one nation.
1071000	1086000	If you remember back to 2023, we have Canadian politician Larry McGuire, who wrote to the Canadian Defense Minister requesting to sort of start to divulge UAP information due to the collaboration effort between five eyes nation on the UAP issue.
1086000	1098000	So we at least know outside of NATO, there's sort of a five eyes effort to study UAP, whether the program, whether that means the program, it extends to all five nations or primarily operated on the United States for quasi national.
1098000	1101000	I'm not quite sure, but that's a great, great question.
1101000	1104000	Did you see Eric Davis admitted on Facebook? Yeah, we're about to talk about that.
1104000	1106000	Mr. Ben, I cannot wait.
1106000	1108000	That's very, very excited.
1108000	1112000	The Wilson Davis memo was my first ever video, so I'm happy to revisit it.
1112000	1116000	Who blazing? I don't know, man, I wouldn't be able to speak if I was blazing.
1116000	1118000	Max Parr, thank you so much.
1118000	1120000	You're one of the best researchers out there.
1120000	1123000	So happy you spend hours you do dedicated to this.
1123000	1128000	What's your opinion on and you are own national underwater reconnaissance office BTW.
1128000	1130000	So thank you, Max.
1130000	1132000	I really appreciate it.
1132000	1144000	The kind of USO underwater naval aspect of the phenomenon is something I am going down deep rabbit holes to research.
1144000	1150000	If you watch my off world technologies division, I have studied a specific naval center.
1150000	1161000	I don't really want to talk about and other naval centers that put to mind that sort of the Navy has a massive vested interest in UAP technology exploitation program.
1162000	1164000	Or the study of USO.
1164000	1170000	Earlier in my research, I would solely really only focus on the Air Force and mostly Air Force projects.
1170000	1174000	Of course, the Air Force paper trail and UAP is so simple to find.
1174000	1178000	You can just go back to the 50s and look at USAF regulation 200-2.
1178000	1183000	You can look at any sort of USAF response to any sort of UAP discussion.
1183000	1185000	But I'm really starting to take a harder look at the Navy.
1185000	1191000	So with the Navy comes analysis of any sort of underwater reconnaissance office.
1191000	1194000	Any sort of alleged underwater bases as well.
1194000	1196000	I was actually talking to Ryan Wood about this.
1196000	1201000	In his research, he has come across two really interesting spots underwater.
1201000	1205000	One off the coast of Florida and one off of Catalina Island in California.
1205000	1209000	So as we move further with this channel, I know I've done the two USO videos.
1209000	1218000	I really want to dive into more about kind of the Navy and any sort of underwater effort in relation to the phenomenon and USO in particular.
1219000	1221000	What do you think of the Phil Schneider story?
1221000	1222000	I haven't.
1222000	1223000	And thanks again, Max Parr.
1223000	1224000	I really appreciate that.
1224000	1225000	Guys, Max Parr is a good friend of mine.
1225000	1227000	I really appreciate everything he does.
1227000	1228000	He's a great dude.
1228000	1230000	What do you think about the Phil Schneider story?
1230000	1231000	I haven't paid.
1231000	1232000	I haven't done it.
1232000	1233000	It's due diligence.
1233000	1241000	What I do know is that Phil Schneider claimed to have experienced a firefight in underground tunnels with NHI.
1241000	1248000	And I think fellow soldiers he was with were turned into some sort of goop or just faced horrific weaponry.
1248000	1250000	And I know he also had a very mysterious death.
1250000	1253000	Now, that is the extent I know a Phil Schneider.
1253000	1258000	I would like to look at him someday, you know, maybe he'd be a candidate for a UFO whistler's blur video.
1258000	1259000	I'm not sure yet.
1259000	1265000	I always admit when I don't know something that right now my knowledge on Phil Schneider is not great.
1265000	1267000	Interview with Danny Sheehan might be fruitful.
1267000	1268000	I would love that.
1268000	1271000	I don't know if I could talk my friend Jesse Michaels though.
1271000	1274000	He put out that interview with Sheehan and that's the best.
1274000	1281000	Now, there is a good chance that very soon Mr. Michaels and I will be together.
1281000	1285000	So I'd love to maybe just have a discussion with him.
1286000	1287000	Maybe record it.
1287000	1290000	And maybe we could talk to Jesse about his experience with Sheehan.
1290000	1292000	So I think that'd be great.
1292000	1293000	What does Brady say?
1293000	1296000	Anyone who has checked out the old interviews on Greer's channel, it's really missing out.
1296000	1297000	I 100% agree.
1297000	1300000	Anybody who's listening right now, please go to...
1300000	1303000	No, I got the website wrong earlier.
1303000	1306000	Go to DrStevenGreer.com.
1306000	1309000	Up in the banner there's a link to witness testimony.
1309000	1314000	There you can find everything from Philip Corso to Robert Wood to...
1314000	1317000	I think you can even find like Carl Wolfe there and so forth.
1317000	1320000	You can find a ton of interesting interviews.
1320000	1322000	Programmed life forms.
1322000	1325000	They are clones using real ET DNA from down to UFOs.
1325000	1328000	They clone the beans and put some advanced tech in their brains to control them.
1328000	1330000	That is an avenue I'd really like to explore.
1330000	1334000	If you have some documents or just kind of research avenues on PLFs, please send them to me.
1334000	1335000	UAPGrever.com.
1335000	1337000	I'll be better about the emails.
1337000	1340000	I'd really like to learn more, especially as I look into witness 10.
1340000	1341000	10, 8, 9, 2.
1341000	1346000	And again, if you want to look at a witness who spoke to Greer about PLFs, 10, 8, 9, 2.
1346000	1348000	Jim Shoe, I love you too.
1348000	1351000	I just got done with a skinny bob, an alien deep dive.
1351000	1353000	Do you believe either of those are legitimate?
1353000	1359000	I have not done the due diligence into either video.
1359000	1363000	I know that the alien interview is kind of Jon Stewart's jam.
1363000	1365000	I'll let him do his thing.
1365000	1366000	I got to...
1366000	1368000	I think he's got an interview coming out in December.
1369000	1371000	So I'll reserve judgment for then.
1371000	1373000	The skinny bob, I know that's floated around.
1373000	1375000	I know it's such a contentious thing, but correct me if I'm wrong.
1375000	1381000	I think some people are inferring that Ross Colthart alluded to skinny bob being a...
1381000	1385000	maybe skinny bob or other footage in the public domain being legitimate.
1385000	1387000	So correct me if I'm wrong.
1387000	1393000	Hans Kamler must have had knowledge about the Magenta 1933 and maybe Germans moved it to Skoda Works.
1393000	1395000	Okay, yeah, and this might be Skoda Works I'm thinking of.
1395000	1402000	Speaking of the 1933 crash, I know two guys that are excellent and have so much knowledge on the 33.
1402000	1408000	So if you guys want to see a revisit of that, this guy has so many connections to Alan Dolos and so forth.
1408000	1410000	I'd love to revisit that.
1410000	1412000	Do you think Eric Davis would testify?
1412000	1413000	I don't know.
1413000	1417000	Maybe he has behind closed doors, but I really don't know.
1417000	1418000	I really don't know.
1418000	1420000	Okay, let's see.
1420000	1421000	Let's see.
1421000	1424000	The Wilson Davis is huge confirmation of the fact that Steven Greer...
1424000	1425000	Yes, thank you.
1425000	1427000	I know people have been talking about that lately.
1427000	1435000	This is a confirmation that Steven Greer in 1997 did brief Admiral Thomas Wilson,
1435000	1442000	a deputy director of the DIA and other politicians on what we can assume is the disclosure briefing document from 2001.
1442000	1448000	If you guys haven't read that, I'll flash it on screen in just a minute and we can talk about that as well.
1449000	1453000	It's been said that every deep water deployment that has a nuclear payload has some type of UAP encounter,
1453000	1454000	every single deployment.
1454000	1458000	That brings to mind Lou speaking recently of the...
1458000	1459000	What was it?
1459000	1460000	Hawk missile?
1460000	1465000	No, I can't remember what type of missile, but in a retrieval recovery to find the cassette for the missile telemetry data,
1465000	1470000	a massive UAP rising from the surface and essentially taking the missile.
1470000	1471000	So that's interesting.
1471000	1474000	You know what case that stuck with me when I covered USO?
1474000	1475000	It was the case of the...
1475000	1480000	I think it was a Tic-Tac in 1950 recorded in Blue Book.
1480000	1483000	That was like a Tic-Tac or Ovoid shape.
1483000	1484000	I don't think quite Tic-Tac.
1484000	1487000	That was just hovering above the surface almost turning the water.
1487000	1489000	That was almost like vibrating very fast.
1489000	1494000	For some reason, that particular USO case has really stuck in my head.
1494000	1496000	Phil Schneider was very sketchy.
1496000	1498000	His death was very sketchy.
1498000	1499000	We got to look into that, guys.
1499000	1505000	I think one time I want to make a video just talking about suspicious deaths of UAP adjacent individuals,
1505000	1508000	whether that be researchers or whistleblowers.
1508000	1514000	What comes to mind is James E. McDonald as a primary person I want to talk about.
1514000	1515000	Two cents.
1515000	1516000	Thank you very much.
1516000	1520000	Criminally underserved curves, one of the few genuine nuts and bolts reporters out there.
1520000	1521000	I really appreciate that.
1521000	1524000	Super thanks from Miss Hannah Floyd.
1524000	1525000	Thank you very much.
1525000	1530000	For those who don't know, this is my lovely girlfriend, C.H.
1530000	1532000	When is the program coming out?
1532000	1534000	Hopefully soon.
1534000	1537000	I know Jesse Michaels has actually watched the program.
1537000	1541000	I think that Robert Hastings has as well.
1541000	1544000	Robert Hastings wrote UFOs and nukes.
1544000	1545000	Hopefully soon.
1545000	1551000	I know James Fox has just had another kind of investor on the program.
1551000	1553000	I am beside myself excited to see that.
1553000	1555000	I really want to watch.
1555000	1557000	All right, Max Barr.
1557000	1558000	Isn't it fascinating?
1558000	1561000	I wonder what underwater assets we're going to be considered for ATIPS Project Interloper.
1561000	1570000	Yes, for anybody who doesn't know, Project Interloper is Lou referring to kind of entraping UAP with kind of large nuclear signatures.
1570000	1572000	October, November, according to UFO Twitter.
1572000	1574000	Okay, let's see.
1574000	1580000	P. Is this hobby just our way of making the world more exciting after decades of this and an entire planet that could present evidence?
1580000	1583000	There is still nothing but stories and debunked videos.
1583000	1586000	No, I do disagree with that.
1586000	1593000	At this point, at least to me in my research, I don't really factor videos and I know I've covered two videos in the past, but I'm moving away from that.
1593000	1600000	I think that endless debate is going to circulate around videos.
1600000	1618000	But I do think even the conversation is expanding so much with Lou Azzando, David Grush, but there is a massive, massive, massive, provable trail of a UFO cover-up, an interest in UFO from USG and other military sources from at least the 1930s for factoring in Magenta.
1619000	1630000	The difficulty here and why we're stuck with so many stories is disinformation around this subject has been so complete and successful, it is so difficult to unwind this entire topic.
1630000	1640000	This brings to mind stuff like OPNAV 3820 Air Force Regulation 200-2, which would restrict UFO reporting to certain channels to skirt the balance of Blue Book.
1640000	1647000	This brings to mind J.L. and Heineck in Blue Book, which would discuss away UAP cases as nothing more than swamp gas or weather balloons.
1647000	1659000	The famous case there, of course, is the 1955 case where many people in Michigan saw craft that J.L. and Heineck famously said was swamp gas that even at the time Senator Gerald Ford took an interest in.
1659000	1663000	And all of this extends even towards the modern day with Arrow, right?
1663000	1668000	We have the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1, which demonstrably lies about some of the witnesses there.
1668000	1675000	For example, Michael Herrera, it discusses Michael Herrera seeing an extraterrestrial craft in American block ops team.
1675000	1684000	So even today in 2024, there are official lies by USG elements about the phenomenon and about this topic.
1684000	1689000	So there is a map and let's not forget the Robertson panel, the Condon Report.
1689000	1695000	Remember in the Condon Report by Edward Condon out of CU Boulder, which states there's nothing to UFOs, there's nothing there.
1695000	1705000	There are multiple cases in there such as a 1955 case from an RB-47 jet, which multiple jets in formation saw, I think, a disc shaped UFO.
1705000	1710000	It was caught on visual and radar and so forth performing insane maneuvers.
1710000	1714000	And the Condon Report takes a sighting such as this as whatever, it's nothing.
1714000	1719000	So there's a very provable cover up here for 80 years.
1719000	1722000	What it is, this is what this is our purpose here.
1722000	1724000	And we can even look at Roswell.
1724000	1728000	Remember Roswell case closed the US Air Force debunk on Roswell.
1728000	1731000	It didn't show up until 1994.
1731000	1733000	Roswell occurred in 1947.
1733000	1743000	In that 1994, the US Air Force labeled the Roswell Weather Balloon Project Mogul Flight 4, which was then proven to not have even taken off on the day it was said to have taken off.
1743000	1749000	And I think Roswell explained the bodies away as dummies, which weren't introduced into official USAF service into the 50s.
1749000	1751000	So there's so much sketchiness around this topic.
1751000	1755000	I could ramble on forever, forever.
1755000	1758000	Big dog, miss talking with you and Max, get back in.
1758000	1760000	Let's chat with Max.
1760000	1769000	So what do you think about Eric Mitchell, who Dr. Michael Masters had a very intensive, I don't think I might not be familiar with Eric Mitchell.
1769000	1771000	Please enlighten me.
1771000	1773000	Pete's best.
1773000	1775000	Thank you very much.
1775000	1779000	UFOs and NATO Richard Hall interview was first hand witnesses of finance and your team.
1779000	1781000	Have you seen it many leads?
1781000	1783000	When is the Marshaise video dropping?
1783000	1786000	I have not seen that Richard Hall video, but I'm going to right now.
1786000	1788000	Full transparency.
1788000	1790000	I got two projects I'm working on right now.
1790000	1795000	One of them is the good old Kecksburg 1965 crash retrieval case, which is a fantastic case.
1795000	1797000	I can wait to talk about it.
1797000	1800000	I'm trying some fresh research avenues on that case.
1800000	1807000	Some things that haven't really been explored too much that have been in other kind of researchers files.
1807000	1809000	Okay.
1809000	1811000	Trollmama, what can we do to support you?
1811000	1813000	Just further the UAP discussion.
1813000	1815000	That's it.
1815000	1817000	Continue to talk about UAP.
1817000	1825000	Inform your friends who think that this is just a conspiracy and lump in the UAP phenomenon with Bigfoot, ghosts, ghouls, guests, demons.
1825000	1827000	Explain.
1828000	1830000	Explain the facts behind UAP.
1830000	1832000	That's kind of why I started this channel.
1832000	1842000	Talking about everything from Robertson panel to the creation of Blue Book sign grudge, the players in the 40s and 50s and so forth, early signings, Blue Book signings, USO signings and so forth.
1842000	1844000	Take a couple of hours to answer.
1844000	1845000	Yeah, that's a good idea.
1845000	1846000	I'll do that this week.
1846000	1848000	Absolutely.
1848000	1853000	When I interview Dr. Stephen Greer, I absolutely would interview Dr. Stephen Greer.
1853000	1857000	That would be very controversial, but that is somebody who I would like to speak to.
1857000	1858000	Absolutely.
1858000	1859000	Again, we have our opinions.
1859000	1861000	Everybody has their opinion on Dr. Stephen Greer.
1861000	1867000	I still will not downplay some of his previous efforts in the world of UAP.
1867000	1868000	Absolutely.
1868000	1870000	Big dog, thank you so much.
1870000	1872000	I really appreciate it.
1872000	1876000	Let me get through these and then let's touch on the Wilson Davis memo.
1876000	1877000	Correct.
1877000	1879000	Was that UFO and ET UFO or man made ARB?
1879000	1883000	If you're talking about the Michael Herrera in the Aero Historical Report Volume 1, from
1883000	1886000	time number one, he thought that was a man made vehicle.
1886000	1888000	James Forestall getting thrown off the building.
1888000	1889000	Yep.
1889000	1892000	I think Ryan would have some good stuff to speak about too on that.
1892000	1899000	Of course, Dr. Mack as well died in a, I think like a really sudden drunk driving accident.
1899000	1904000	Dolan, I think Dolan has a book coming out about USOs and I would really like to talk
1904000	1905000	to him about that too.
1905000	1906000	Dolan's just fantastic.
1906000	1908000	Dolan's one of the best of the best guys.
1908000	1910000	I really look up to him.
1910000	1912000	What have I missed?
1912000	1913000	Nothing yet.
1913000	1914000	We're just answering questions right now.
1914000	1916000	Everyone's asking great questions though.
1916000	1917000	That's why we get through this.
1917000	1919000	Can you ask Lou about the tripping photos?
1919000	1920000	Yeah.
1920000	1921000	Actually, that's great.
1921000	1922000	Yeah.
1922000	1923000	Absolutely.
1923000	1924000	What's up, David?
1924000	1925000	Have I?
1925000	1926000	No, I have not.
1926000	1932000	I think the people I want to talk to right away, just researchers, Grant Cameron, Richard
1932000	1934000	Dolan and a huge one, Michael Schrat.
1934000	1936000	I'd love to talk to these guys.
1936000	1940000	There's plenty of other researchers I'm in contact with, but I'd love to sit down and
1940000	1942000	have a conversation with them.
1942000	1947000	So because Libby, I was kind of baiting a Facebook post the other day about UAP USO and the only
1947000	1951000	people to respond like it besides Rando 30s was my active Navy friend from high school.
1951000	1952000	Interesting.
1952000	1956000	It seems on Reddit and other platforms we're starting to get a lot of Navy personnel talking
1956000	1957000	about sightings.
1957000	1961000	I think there was on Reddit about a Navy cook the other day who talked about his USO sightings.
1961000	1962000	I can't really remember it.
1962000	1966000	I only glossed over it, but he saw something rising out of the water.
1966000	1968000	What do I think about the Nazca mummies?
1968000	1970000	The Nazca mummies are very interesting.
1970000	1972000	I will be interested to see further research on them.
1972000	1974000	I know there's a website.
1974000	1979000	I can't remember what it's called, but you can actually view the 3D scans of the mummies,
1979000	1982000	including the one that supposedly has a fetus inside.
1982000	1986000	I know there was some claims that a lot of these mummies were like a goat head or something
1986000	1990000	or animal parts stitched together, but I think there's been some research to kind of downplay
1990000	1991000	that.
1991000	1995000	Again, I'll need to get a better understanding, so I'll continue.
1995000	1999000	I saw a video about a PhD building a nuclear honeypot to draw in UAP.
1999000	2000000	Yep, Mr. Interloper.
2000000	2001000	Okay.
2001000	2005000	Please send your thoughts and prayers to UFO researcher Nicole Sackatch and Courtney.
2005000	2006000	Yeah.
2006000	2009000	I know I've actually spoken to Courtney.
2009000	2016000	Courtney is wonderful, and I have heard that she has faced intimidation and threats for
2016000	2017000	some of the stuff she's done.
2017000	2019000	So yeah, I have heard of that.
2019000	2021000	So yes, keep her in your thoughts.
2021000	2022000	Then thank you so much.
2022000	2023000	I appreciate that.
2023000	2025000	That means the most to me.
2025000	2028000	I really, really, really appreciate that.
2028000	2029000	Mr. Harry, cute dog.
2029000	2031000	What do you think about the Greer files?
2031000	2033000	What do you do with the Greer files?
2033000	2035000	Like or not, you went for the date.
2035000	2037000	The Greer files are not done.
2037000	2038000	There's a lot.
2038000	2042000	Actually, there's a lot more I'm going to cover from the Greer files.
2042000	2043000	Everybody knows UFOs are real.
2043000	2044000	That's not the debate now.
2044000	2045000	Who's piloting them?
2045000	2046000	Yes, I agree.
2046000	2049000	Who's piloting them and who has them?
2049000	2052000	I'll write directly, Dr. Eric.
2052000	2053000	Okay.
2053000	2055000	I'm writing down Eric Mitchell, sir.
2055000	2056000	Thank you.
2056000	2057000	Let's see.
2057000	2060000	Which is a question that has been answered decades ago by Greer and other people like
2060000	2065000	Ben Rich confirmed that UFOs are of two types, ET and manmade UFOs or alien reproduction
2065000	2066000	vehicles.
2066000	2072000	I have started to move forward tremendously in my outlook towards the possibility of ARVs
2072000	2078000	and manmade vehicles derived from extraterrestrial tech or just non-human tech in general.
2078000	2081000	I am starting to really agree with that picture.
2081000	2082000	Sorry.
2082000	2083000	Let me get through these.
2083000	2088000	David, Dr. Banevard Bush, the little I've read on him shows no science-fontological shock.
2088000	2091000	He seemed to have pushed out of government work by 1950.
2091000	2094000	If he was the head of MJ-12, it wasn't for long.
2094000	2099000	Yeah, quite possibly, but remember from the Bowen manuscript, this was in 1962.
2099000	2103000	That was sent to the DOD for review from author Bowen.
2103000	2107000	That was returned in 1962 with handwritten notes from Banevard.
2107000	2110000	He was still fluttering around there.
2110000	2111000	Mark Streik.
2111000	2113000	People still can't decide whether NHIs are ET-dimensional.
2113000	2115000	Yeah, I agree.
2115000	2117000	It's very divided.
2117000	2121000	Of course, that's probably a conversation that's going to continue to tumble around for a long
2121000	2122000	time.
2122000	2124000	I'm talking about everyone.
2124000	2126000	Is it ET or ARVs?
2126000	2127000	Yes.
2127000	2129000	We can start to build a database of flight characteristics and craft.
2129000	2134000	Maybe we can find a demonstrable difference in kind of acceleration mechanisms, sound
2134000	2137000	output of craft, and so forth.
2137000	2139000	Zach, what's up, dude?
2139000	2141000	I've ever listened to Ray Bosch.
2141000	2143000	He's a pastor who the Collins Elite talked to.
2143000	2145000	No, I haven't.
2145000	2147000	I was talking about the Collins Elite with somebody today.
2147000	2150000	I'm absolutely going to chase that down.
2150000	2154000	For anybody who doesn't know what the Collins Elite is, this was referenced by kind of Lou
2154000	2161000	Elizondo and some of that other crew who talk about some people within the USG who are basically
2161000	2164000	terrified to investigate this phenomenon because they think it's demonic.
2164000	2169000	I'd love to kind of really understand the thought process there.
2169000	2172000	I'd really like to go down that rabbit hole.
2172000	2173000	Shrat is a hero.
2173000	2174000	He knows about the man-made UFOs.
2174000	2176000	Shrat is excellent.
2176000	2179000	If you guys don't know Michael Shrat, he's a CAD designer.
2179000	2183000	He's worked with so many witnesses to kind of recreate images of their encounters.
2183000	2191000	And he has covered a lot of cases that deal with UAP that I've sometimes even utilized a human pilot.
2191000	2193000	Jangi Squint.
2193000	2195000	Oh, dude, your profile picture is nasty.
2195000	2196000	But thank you very much.
2196000	2198000	I really appreciate that.
2198000	2200000	The Ivan 0135 videos.
2200000	2202000	I think this is skinny Bob, right?
2202000	2209000	I was asking if anybody can tell me with kind of further confidence if this was...
2209000	2211000	Ross Colthart was alluding to this video.
2211000	2212000	Who is this Dolan guy?
2212000	2213000	Richard Dolan.
2213000	2215000	Please go to his channel and look at some of his books.
2215000	2216000	He's fantastic.
2216000	2220000	Richard Dolan is one of the best UFO researchers out there.
2220000	2223000	Do you know when the program Insiders Book Sentinels of Ether will be published in full?
2223000	2228000	I do not, but I have asked the same questions because I would like to read more.
2228000	2234000	Have I looked further into Draper, Gaither, and Anderson and their connections to the SAGE program, MIT Rad Lab?
2234000	2235000	Max Barr?
2235000	2236000	No, I haven't.
2236000	2241000	And I know when Max Barr drops a line of inquiry, guys, you listen.
2241000	2243000	So no, I'm writing that down, man.
2243000	2244000	I really appreciate that.
2244000	2246000	I actually have no idea.
2246000	2248000	So that's fantastic.
2248000	2250000	I appreciate that.
2250000	2251000	Radle, holy crap.
2251000	2252000	Thank you, Radle.
2252000	2254000	Thank you so much.
2254000	2258000	I really appreciate that, especially the Volk poster looking out.
2258000	2259000	That's incredible.
2259000	2260000	Thank you so much.
2260000	2261000	Thank you.
2261000	2263000	It's the best.
2263000	2268000	What do you make of Lou Elizondo's claims regarding excision of a technological device and implant from a U.S.
2268000	2271000	servicemen who experienced a UAP event?
2271000	2276000	I think that the implant has been a territory I have been a little afraid to go down.
2276000	2281000	Of course, there's just that and what's it called?
2281000	2284000	Abductions or they can just be so hairy.
2284000	2296000	What I need to do here is now return to the sort of Dr. Lear and his kind of extensive work on supposed implant removal.
2296000	2301000	So once I kind of looked on that, I'll have a way better kind of understanding of this.
2301000	2306000	But I found it fascinating Lou would talk about that with Ross, especially the implant.
2306000	2309000	You are really cool and doesn't afraid of anything.
2309000	2310000	Thank you, Peter.
2310000	2311000	I appreciate that.
2311000	2312000	I'm afraid of a lot.
2312000	2316000	Black Ops guys showed up at my house and threatened me not to talk about this again.
2316000	2318000	I'd be pretty dang scared.
2318000	2319000	But thank you.
2319000	2321000	YouTube.com slash Richard M. Dolan.
2321000	2323000	I highly recommend checking him out.
2323000	2325000	Would you recommend interview Nick Redfern?
2325000	2327000	Yeah, absolutely.
2327000	2329000	Nick Redfern is always really interesting.
2329000	2333000	If you guys listen to the podcast Mysterious Universe, he is always referenced on there too.
2333000	2335000	So absolutely.
2335000	2336000	Yep.
2336000	2341000	Dr. Lear has some awesome work on implants and that is going to be the next source.
2341000	2342000	Okay.
2342000	2345000	Shall we discuss the kind of Wilson Davis stuff now?
2345000	2350000	Let me figure out how to share my screen guys.
2350000	2358000	Present share screen share screen.
2358000	2361000	Let me window entire screens.
2361000	2362000	I've never done this before guys.
2362000	2365000	I'm still a bit of a novice share.
2365000	2367000	Okay.
2367000	2369000	So here we have from the other day.
2369000	2374000	This was from a private Facebook group that Eric Davis is in.
2374000	2378000	And I believe since then, of course, I haven't been able to confirm this.
2378000	2383000	But I think since then he has left this Facebook group because as far as I know,
2383000	2386000	this was supposed to be a private endeavor that was leaked.
2386000	2392000	But Eric Davis, if you don't know, let's start with an introduction to the Wilson Davis memo.
2392000	2393000	How about that?
2393000	2398000	Because I know anybody watching this channel probably knows what the Wilson Davis memo is.
2398000	2400000	Let me just pull up the file.
2400000	2404000	We'll just do like a quick 15 second, probably like two minutes actually.
2404000	2407000	We'll just go through the memo real fast.
2407000	2410000	The Wilson Davis, sorry, I have so many files.
2410000	2418000	Wilson Davis, Eric Davis meeting with Admiral Wilson.
2418000	2420000	Okay.
2420000	2421000	Good.
2421000	2422000	Yeah.
2422000	2427000	So the Wilson Davis meeting recounts a meeting with Eric Davis and rear Admiral Thomas Wilson.
2427000	2430000	The parking lot of EGNG in Las Vegas in 2002.
2430000	2432000	And these, of course, are the meeting notes.
2432000	2440000	This is following a briefing from Dr. Steven Greer in 1997 that he gave to select members of Congress and other individuals.
2440000	2442000	So one of these being Steven Lovekin.
2442000	2449000	If you guys remember the person I covered who talked about a, I really hope so.
2449000	2451000	I truly hope so.
2451000	2455000	And maybe because mom's from discussed and other world technologies division.
2455000	2457000	But anyways, back to the Wilson Davis memo.
2457000	2461000	If you guys, I recommend watching my video on the Wilson Davis memo and maybe a slog to get through.
2461000	2462000	I'm sorry.
2462000	2464000	It's not my most exciting work.
2464000	2465000	I'm sorry.
2465000	2466000	I will revisit it.
2466000	2469000	But if we look through this memo, it recounts meeting notes.
2469000	2480000	And this is apparently about Admiral Thomas Wilson investigating the UFO program after being inspired by his discussion with Steven Greer,
2480000	2481000	Luke Shan and others.
2481000	2483000	And he is Stonewald.
2483000	2488000	Apparently this program was embedded within special access programs, multi tiered.
2488000	2498000	What is really interesting for me to look into now that this memo has almost been confirmed by Wilson or Eric Davis is the discussion of the project keepers.
2498000	2500000	Of course, this is Commander Will Miller.
2500000	2503000	I've talked about him quite a bit.
2503000	2505000	Commander Will Miller.
2505000	2510000	Let me just find the exact line about the keepers.
2510000	2511000	Because there's just so much.
2511000	2514000	I don't want to make this a full Wilson Davis video.
2514000	2522000	But I really recommend kind of watching my video on it because we kind of go through a to Z of the Wilson Davis memo.
2522000	2525000	But yes, okay.
2525000	2528000	And the keepers of the program, I forget what they're called.
2528000	2533000	I'm trying to think, but one of these, the watch committee, that's it.
2533000	2540000	Comprising the watch committee is a security director and I say retired CI expert, a program director and a corporate attorney.
2540000	2548000	And these are the people Admiral Wilson met with and was kind of Stonewald from looking more into the looking more into the project.
2548000	2557000	So the program manager directly said that the uap program doesn't fit into any weapons program Intel program spec ops or logistics program.
2557000	2561000	It was a reverse engineering program something recovered years ago in the past.
2561000	2562000	Is this magenta?
2562000	2563000	Is this rock?
2563000	2567000	Well, is this Kingman or is this multiple?
2567000	2570000	I'm leaning towards multiple craft.
2570000	2578000	So within the within the Wilson Davis document, this goes into further about kind of what the program says.
2578000	2581000	The technology is not from this earth in this document.
2581000	2583000	I think MJ 12 is also.
2583000	2586000	Yeah, Miller Miller also asked about MJ 12.
2586000	2594000	I can't remember right now if if whatever his name if sorry, Admiral Wilson and Eric Davis, my mind's kind of spinning right now.
2594000	2596000	I'm sorry guys for any mix ups.
2596000	2602000	But what is interesting here is for Thomas Wilson to talk about Corso Philip J Corso if you guys haven't read the day after Roswell.
2602000	2610000	I would highly recommend reading that mentioned the SAP OCC and the reorganization of SAP SAP OCC and the program almost being found in an audit in the mid 90s.
2610000	2615000	I highly recommend reading the black budget of the United States by Catherine Austin fits here.
2615000	2617000	Anyways, we'll come back to that.
2617000	2620000	So Eric Davis.
2620000	2626000	I'll read this word for word, but I, you know, I'm not really like a react content type of guy, but we'll just do that.
2626000	2628000	Okay, Eric Davis says to Andre.
2628000	2630000	No, he told me that he would deny meeting with me.
2630000	2632000	Should I publish anything about that?
2632000	2642000	I never published anything about our meeting, but Ed Mitchell's unethical kids released his copy covered by Ed signed NDA of my friends of my interview notes to a friend who had an interest in UFOs.
2642000	2654000	The latter individual is responsible for shopping the notes at a UFO conference to the highest bidder, which was Grant Cameron unethical Grant Cameron consulted a lawyer and decided to publicize the interview notes on this YouTube channel and a podcast.
2654000	2661000	After this is when Wilson denied meeting me when contacted by multiple ufologists and UFO media personalities and mainstream news reporters.
2661000	2664000	But here's the issue with that guys.
2664000	2666000	I have.
2666000	2674000	Remember James Rigney I covered in the video he was the one who kind of got the memo out of the estate got it to Grant Cameron.
2674000	2678000	James Rigney was not sold this document.
2678000	2685000	Whoever the individual in Edgar Mitchell Oscar Edgar Mitchell's estate.
2685000	2693000	Went through his files and between between James Rigney and this individual I don't know who this individual is.
2694000	2712000	And James Rigney shared this with Grant Cameron in fact I have James Rigney up here because to talk about like a Edgar Mitchell's unethical kids I don't think this involved his children at all besides just a relative and Grant Cameron I don't think was sold this document as well.
2712000	2720000	So James Rigney says I showed these notes to Grant and then a few weeks later sent him a copy yes and I've talked to James about this he said this to me.
2720000	2726000	To say they were hawked around to the highest bidder is ludicrous yes there was never a mention of any sale here.
2726000	2732000	Dr Mitchell's family were not involved at all other than Dr Mitchell's nephew now deceased I'm happy to clear any of this up.
2732000	2745000	James Rigney has started to he doesn't post much but I really like that he's talking about this because I think by Eric Davis here he's obviously a little emotional about the Wilson Davis memo and he might not be fully familiar with the process of how it leaked.
2745000	2752000	But I will say before the memo made its way to public multiple people have seen the memo right multiple researchers have.
2752000	2766000	I have also talked to an individual who told me in an off record conversation that he was aware of the memo years before it was ever released so there's some pretty important people who know about this.
2766000	2775000	And I'm not familiar with Nicole actually actually yeah we just talked about Nicole but she has an email from Grant Cameron regarding this.
2775000	2786000	She's Grant Cameron says wow someone is pissed for the record I never shop the Wilson Davis memo notes I promised James Rigney that I would put them in beyond managing magic.
2786000	2790000	When I realized I could not do that I just made the notes free to anyone who asked about them.
2790000	2792000	Chase Williams got a copy and helped me.
2792000	2796000	If everyone had stopped playing cover up I would never have been in such a position.
2796000	2798000	Usually Eric is pretty accurate.
2798000	2804000	He messed up his sovereignty accusations and losing that I would have thought he would be a little more quiet.
2804000	2810000	For the record many of the top researchers have now confirmed they have had the Wilson documents for years and chose to sit on it.
2810000	2812000	Yes, I've definitely heard that too.
2812000	2819000	Why must I be the guy to have to disclose stuff other to disclose stuff other disclosure researchers are hiding.
2819000	2821000	Wilson documents Johnson UFO study.
2821000	2823000	Interesting.
2823000	2825000	Douglas aircraft documents.
2825000	2827000	Interesting.
2827000	2829000	Advanced physics group notes Rockefeller initiative documents.
2829000	2831000	Interesting.
2831000	2842000	And yet vindicated the alien autopsy emails for anybody who hasn't heard about the alien autopsy emails that surrounds the supposed alien autopsy film that was obviously faked in like 11 apartment.
2842000	2849000	But that might be based on a real sort of autopsy there's an email chain with Dr. Kit Green that covers this.
2849000	2853000	So that's what that's what I would like to cover that too because that's very interesting the future.
2853000	2856000	Finally, almost all of the stuff I disclose.
2856000	2861000	I have never read the only I only had to read the first page of the Wilson interview to know what I was holding.
2861000	2864000	Interesting to see Mitchell had to sign an NDA.
2864000	2869000	I assume Bigelow controlled that that's very interesting Edgar Mitchell sign an NDA to receive these meeting notes.
2869000	2872000	If businessmen can silence researchers with NDAs.
2872000	2877000	Why is the community always crying about unethical government obeying their NDAs.
2877000	2879000	No one ever offered me money.
2879000	2883000	Therefore, I was never forced to sign my life away and lie my ass off.
2883000	2887000	So, yeah, I think Grant Cameron makes a really powerful statement here.
2887000	2895000	So I guess the question is now, why did Eric Davis wait until 2024 to discuss the Wilson Davis Mumble.
2895000	2906000	I find that Eric Davis I kind of said this earlier kind of pops up and around when he makes to make statements whether this be discounting guys like Jason Sands discounting Bob Lazar and so forth.
2906000	2916000	Lou, I mean, sorry, Eric Davis has been on kind of a tear lately, talking about Lou saying that he Lou never ran all sapper and a tip specifically.
2916000	2924000	So it seems that I really can't think of an exact reason why now of all times he would discuss the Wilson Davis document.
2924000	2935000	If you remember back to 2004 in Stephen Green Street's basement episode, Green Street actually asked Eric Davis about the memo and Eric Davis just gave the hole.
2935000	2938000	I cannot confirm or deny that.
2938000	2944000	So why now but this is really interesting and extremely consequential.
2944000	2951000	I remember back in the day, guys like John Greenwald and John Greenwald has a fantastic new video on all to all sap and a tip.
2951000	2953000	I really recommend watching that.
2953000	2959000	But he I think he thought the Wilson Davis notes at least I'm not thought he proposed a theory they might be like a film script.
2959000	2963000	So there was just a lot of information shopping around about them.
2963000	2969000	So let's look at some of these comments real fast before we carry on this.
2969000	2974000	Am I mistaken or does Robert Bigelow always seem to get a pass because he's interested in this stuff could be totally wrong.
2974000	2977000	But does anybody ask him to put up or shut up?
2977000	2978000	No, that's a good point.
2978000	2986000	Of course, he's been interested in kind of knit, of course, behind nids and kind of a consciousness studies and after death studies.
2986000	2991000	He has been very quiet since a lot of this is has been discussed.
2991000	2993000	It's because Eric Davis still has a security clearance.
2993000	2994000	Yes, pretty clear.
2994000	2995000	The memo is real.
2995000	2997000	That's why he has to do these obtuse attempts at obfuscation.
2997000	3002000	Yeah, I the at least to myself, I'll admit kind of my biases here.
3002000	3007000	I've always considered the Wilson Davis memo since I began researching it to be authentic.
3007000	3010000	I find just so much valuable information in the memo.
3010000	3013000	And if you guys haven't read it, I really recommend reading it.
3013000	3018000	I think in my video on the Wilson Davis memo, I have it linked.
3018000	3027000	So shall we talk about the, unless anybody has any questions, we'll discuss the 2004 kind of JSOC.
3027000	3031000	You know, is this better for everybody at the black better for everybody's screen?
3031000	3035000	Probably next we'll talk about the JSOC.
3035000	3040000	So Davis admits to what he has is controlling narrative.
3040000	3041000	That's true.
3041000	3042000	Yeah, that's a good point.
3042000	3044000	That is a good point.
3045000	3051000	Doesn't anyone think it's weird to go with the serious TSS clearance would discuss something like this and on and not use not like signal.
3051000	3055000	Yeah, it is weird, but I know I think it's that same Facebook group or others.
3055000	3061000	Eric Davis has been very cavalier about about like Bob Lazar, Jason Sands.
3061000	3065000	He seems to really like a kind of blab about this.
3065000	3066000	So how do you flip the style?
3066000	3071000	If you have a Sumatra PDF, all you have to do is press I, and it really helps.
3071000	3072000	Sumatra PDF is the best.
3072000	3074000	I highly recommend it.
3074000	3075000	Okay.
3075000	3081000	So what let's get to this last one by LC in the weaponized ed cat or weaponized episode with Ernie Klein.
3081000	3085000	He mentions anytime he brought up the memo around Davis put off, etc.
3085000	3087000	other spines would go rigid truth.
3087000	3092000	So which recently Ross Colt Hart did an AMA on Reddit.
3092000	3094000	I think this is his second one.
3094000	3100000	The first time he did an AMA, I think the vast majority of the questions were saying Ross tell us where the craft is in regards to what the
3100000	3106000	craft is in regards to when Ross discussed a craft so large that a building had to be built around it.
3106000	3108000	This AMA was very different.
3108000	3110000	People asked a lot of great questions.
3110000	3114000	Of course, people are kind of discussing skinny Bob and stuff like that again.
3114000	3118000	And somebody said, let's see if I can pull it up.
3118000	3123000	Sorry, I'm not like a guest browser here.
3123000	3125000	Ross called her.
3125000	3127000	No.
3127000	3129000	I'm not a robot motorcycles.
3129000	3132000	No, the helmets won't count.
3132000	3134000	Traffic lights really.
3134000	3136000	Why do you guys have to and you guys watch me do this?
3136000	3137000	I'll probably mess it up.
3137000	3140000	There we go.
3140000	3143000	Look who we got in the chat.
3143000	3144000	Just bought.
3144000	3145000	What's up, Michael?
3145000	3147000	Thanks so much for tuning in.
3147000	3148000	Hey, cool.
3148000	3149000	What's going on, man?
3149000	3150000	Thank you.
3150000	3151000	I really appreciate you tuning in.
3151000	3152000	That's awesome.
3152000	3154000	I'm going to leave this up for a little bit.
3154000	3155000	I really appreciate that, Michael.
3155000	3160000	We're just about to talk about the 2004 incident and sentinels of ether.
3160000	3164000	Just because I think so many people have been talking about John Stewart.
3164000	3169000	And this 2004 incident and there hasn't really been a lot of look back to
3169000	3170000	sentinels of ether.
3170000	3173000	So let's get started, guys.
3173000	3177000	Shardu Shardul 127 or Shardul 27.
3177000	3179000	And this guy's actually in my discord.
3179000	3181000	This was a fantastic question.
3181000	3183000	So if you are watching right now, thanks, dude.
3183000	3185000	I know he posted this in the discord.
3185000	3187000	So thank you.
3187000	3189000	This is a fantastic question.
3189000	3190000	Hi, Ross.
3190000	3193000	Thank you for all that you have done and will do with this topic.
3193000	3197000	Is there any merit to the claim that in 2004 there was a blue on blue
3197000	3201000	firefight between a JSOC unit and a Lockheed Martin recovery team over
3201000	3206000	UAP craft resulting in the deaths of two JSOC members?
3206000	3209000	Ross says just straight up yes and recomments.
3209000	3212000	And that's not the only incident.
3212000	3216000	So now we have Ross commenting on the validity out.
3216000	3217000	And of course, this is just Ross.
3217000	3221000	He hasn't posted any sources or data for this.
3221000	3222000	How do I join the discord server?
3222000	3223000	I think I can post a link here.
3223000	3225000	Let me post it.
3225000	3230000	Sorry, let me post that real fast.
3230000	3236000	Invite people.
3236000	3240000	Yeah, if that link works.
3240000	3242000	So, yes.
3242000	3247000	So we have Ross cold heart commenting on a 2004 blue on blue situation.
3247000	3249000	We have John Stewart's story.
3249000	3252000	I believe this came out in late 2023.
3252000	3255000	I think this was in December.
3255000	3259000	And this was about an individual reaching out to.
3259000	3261000	Let's get Michael's chat back up here.
3261000	3262000	That's cool.
3262000	3267000	This was about an individual reaching out to John about a story of a blue
3267000	3272000	on blue firefight that occurred in, I think, I think.
3272000	3275000	So there's a difference here now between the two sources.
3275000	3279000	I think that Stewart source and we'll get through this as we read through.
3279000	3283000	Claim to this event occurred near the Texas side of the border in the Texas
3283000	3284000	and Mexico border.
3284000	3288000	Sentinels of ether talks about this being on the Koyame Mexico side of the
3288000	3292000	border, which as we know from the Koyame video is very close to the Texas border.
3292000	3296000	So I'll read just this, just the initial message.
3296000	3298000	And then we'll kind of just pick and choose through.
3298000	3300000	I don't just want to, this isn't story time.
3300000	3301000	I'm just not going to read through everything.
3301000	3302000	Hi, John.
3302000	3303000	I saw one of your recent podcasts.
3303000	3305000	Thank you for covering the UAP topic.
3305000	3307000	I have some information you may find useful for this.
3307000	3311000	I served in the USMC and Defense Intelligence Agency as an intelligence
3311000	3314000	analyst and then moved on to Lockheed as a security program manager.
3314000	3316000	I no longer work at Lockheed.
3316000	3319000	I was read into the UAP program and the UAP issue is multifaceted.
3319000	3322000	Well, generally it's known to the public at this point from the recent news
3322000	3325000	articles that the United States USG has its own recovery and storage team for
3325000	3327000	downed in HICraft.
3327000	3332000	Most of the people, okay, sorry.
3332000	3335000	Most of the people in USG community know about downed craft.
3335000	3338000	This is where the real core of the UAP issue lies, not the religious
3338000	3340000	implications or the biologics.
3340000	3345000	Lockheed has had this team since the 1970s and have amassed a hoard of both
3345000	3349000	intact and crashed UAP at a facility in Palmdale, California.
3349000	3352000	At some point around the mid 1980s, they were able to successfully reverse
3352000	3355000	engineer one of these NHICraft and keep this hidden and completely
3355000	3357000	obfuscated from the USG.
3357000	3363000	One of my senior security managers was firsthand legacy witness to this.
3363000	3366000	Lockheed even relinquished some of the original NHICraft back into the
3366000	3373000	custody of USG and lied, quote, saying that they could make no progress.
3373000	3376000	This is where the heart of the dispute between Congress today and Lockheed
3376000	3380000	is coming in to head in Schumer's recent UAP bill demanding the tech from
3380000	3382000	the UAP legacy program.
3382000	3386000	The USG realized that it was lied to about, sorry, I'm just having trouble
3386000	3388000	reading.
3388000	3391000	The USG realized it was lied to about the progress and now want full custody
3391000	3393000	of the ARV vehicles that Lockheed currently has.
3393000	3396000	Even though I was read into the general UAP program, I was never privy to
3396000	3400000	this specific group while I worked for Lockheed, the in-house recovery team.
3400000	3403000	There were only brief water cooler discussions I had with people directly
3403000	3406000	involved that are personal friends I've known for many years.
3406000	3409000	So let's stop before we get into the incident here.
3409000	3413000	USG for anyone asking is US government.
3413000	3418000	Hey, Aiden, my contacts get dry fast.
3418000	3420000	I know I blink a lot.
3420000	3423000	I saw that in the interview with Ryan Wood.
3423000	3424000	I blinked a ton.
3424000	3426000	But USG is the United States government.
3426000	3430000	The story here, what is really interesting is so many times throughout
3430000	3434000	my videos, we've covered a retrieval effort, mostly like spearheaded by
3434000	3439000	the Air Force and so forth, Air Force elements, possibly JSOC.
3439000	3443000	There's good reason to believe that something like the 24th STS group
3443000	3447000	within JSOC and the Air Force has some part to play in crash retrievals.
3447000	3451000	There's actually a Reddit whistleblower, a supposed whistleblower a couple
3451000	3454000	months ago that had a really interesting testimony on this.
3454000	3459000	But to hear this about private corporation recovery teams, this is
3459000	3462000	really interesting and not something that we have covered too much.
3462000	3466000	Of course, there's the idea of these black operative black operator programs
3466000	3470000	that deal with craft and deal with humans and deal with operations.
3470000	3473000	But we have never really explored the extent to which they have
3473000	3474000	recovered downcraft.
3474000	3479000	So here this individual reaching out to John Stuart claims that Lockheed
3479000	3481000	Martin has its own recovery team.
3481000	3484000	Now, I can't remember and we'll get through this if this describes
3484000	3486000	kind of the experience of the operators, what they have if they're
3486000	3489000	former like tier one, if they're just PMC guys.
3489000	3493000	I'm not quite sure, but this is really interesting to dive into this territory
3493000	3498000	about basically a private team that is not associated with kind of US
3498000	3499000	operations.
3499000	3502000	As we get into this, this raises some even more interesting questions
3502000	3506000	how this Lockheed Martin recovery team deals with JSOC units.
3506000	3509000	And if you don't know JSOC, this is joint special operations command.
3509000	3512000	This is the best of the best in US armed forces.
3512000	3513000	This is like 24th STS.
3513000	3515000	This is one 60th division.
3515000	3517000	This is Navy SEAL Team 6.
3517000	3518000	This is Green Beret.
3518000	3522000	These are just some bad dudes.
3522000	3525000	So I'll keep, let's see how much longer we got in this.
3525000	3526000	Yeah.
3526000	3527000	Okay.
3527000	3530000	I'll read the rest of this and then we'll discuss.
3530000	3534000	I know of an incident in 2004 where one of Lockheed's own reverse
3534000	3537000	engineered ARV craft, one of Lockheed's own reverse engineered
3537000	3541000	ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicle, crashed into the Southwest.
3541000	3543000	The USG was monitoring.
3543000	3546000	They thought it was genuine NHI craft.
3546000	3549000	They sent their own recovery team out from JSOC, but there was a
3549000	3552000	violent altercation between them and the Lockheed recovery team
3552000	3554000	that resulted in two deaths.
3554000	3556000	This is the incident Grush is referring to when he says people
3556000	3559000	have been killed to keep the UAP secret.
3559000	3562000	This was a blue on blue situation between two completely separate
3562000	3563000	recovery teams.
3563000	3566000	The USG group had no awareness of the other one.
3566000	3570000	I was privy to the names of two cuts off our satellite office.
3570000	3574000	However, I would not go to public and I am not sure about releasing
3574000	3575000	this information.
3575000	3578000	The only caveat to this is I remember the names of the two airmen
3578000	3581000	that were killed, especially stuck out to me because they were
3581000	3583000	both clearly of Asian descent.
3583000	3584000	I am Asian myself.
3584000	3587000	I debated a few times trying to inquire a way to track down
3587000	3590000	immediate relatives and maybe contacting them.
3590000	3592000	I don't know what should be done.
3592000	3594000	Honestly, I'm fairly certain the immediate families to this day
3594000	3598000	are not aware of the actual circumstances regarding their passing.
3598000	3601000	I think John and him kind of go back a little bit there.
3601000	3607000	Here we are faced with the kind of, yes, I think 0604 says this
3607000	3608000	friendly fire here.
3608000	3610000	This is blue on blue action here.
3610000	3613000	Like Michael says, JSOC has a bunch of good guys.
3613000	3614000	This is really interesting.
3614000	3618000	Here we are faced with the prospect of a US based retrieval team.
3618000	3622000	They have their rapid reaction unit and they see this craft they
3622000	3624000	think is an HII craft.
3624000	3627000	Then there's the Lockheed Martin team that knows that their own
3627000	3630000	reverse engineered ARV has crashed and they sent their team.
3630000	3635000	There's a collision between the forces and JSOC, maybe they got the
3635000	3638000	jump on them, which is surprising because JSOC again is the best of
3638000	3642000	the best by this PMC, Private Military Corporation, almost
3642000	3644000	Lockheed team.
3644000	3649000	We have this story here and I will link this in the discord if
3649000	3652000	anybody wants to read more because there's a lot here.
3652000	3657000	But this parallels the story told by the insider that Michael has
3657000	3661000	spoken to who published two chapters of a manuscript called
3661000	3665000	Sentinels of Ether, which is kind of used in this individual's
3665000	3670000	words as basically a ploy on dops or similar to secret machines
3670000	3674000	by Tom DeLonge to put truth and fiction to get out information.
3674000	3678000	I think this was also done back in the 80s or 90s with Sedge
3678000	3680000	Masters and Project Zodiac.
3680000	3682000	So this isn't a new tactic.
3682000	3684000	This has been done multiple times.
3684000	3686000	And yes, that is really terrifying.
3686000	3690000	But we won't read Sentinels of Ether, but I have just read it
3690000	3693000	recently so I can tell you a little more about what it's about.
3693000	3698000	This story doesn't directly deal with a craft recovery.
3698000	3701000	This deals with people being trafficked.
3701000	3706000	And there is basically a JSOC team that gets the jump on, not
3706000	3709000	necessarily the jump, but they observe this trafficking operation
3709000	3711000	from some Hueys.
3711000	3715000	And this JSOC team is cornered and killed brutally by whatever
3715000	3718000	this team is that are trafficking these individuals.
3718000	3723000	The individuals are in Koyama, Mexico, and they load up on their
3723000	3726000	helicopters, maybe with their cargo, maybe not, and they fly
3726000	3729000	to a secret base around the region.
3729000	3731000	So those are the differences here.
3731000	3734000	There's no mention of Lockheed in the Sentinels of Ether story.
3734000	3737000	There's no mention of Lockheed in John Stuart's whistleblower.
3737000	3740000	There's no mention of craft in Sentinels of Ether, but there's
3740000	3743000	mention of craft in John Stuart's whistleblower.
3743000	3747000	There's a direct location given in Sentinels of Ether, including
3747000	3749000	Koyama, Mexico.
3749000	3751000	It's a little different in John Stuart's, which calls mainland
3751000	3753000	US.
3753000	3755000	So those are the small differences.
3755000	3758000	Of course, we don't have direct supporting evidence, but this
3758000	3762000	2004, this reminds me so closely of the 1974 Koyama incident,
3762000	3766000	which occurred 40 years later in the same place in Koyama,
3766000	3768000	Mexico.
3768000	3770000	If you guys haven't watched that video, this is about an alleged
3770000	3775000	story of a crash that occurred on the Mexican side of the
3775000	3778000	border seen by people in kind of a remote area.
3778000	3781000	A Mexican retrieval team is sent to investigate.
3781000	3785000	The CIA has the jump on this recovery operation, and they send
3785000	3787000	in the rapid reaction unit.
3787000	3790000	But something based on their surveillance has shown that the
3790000	3794000	Mexican retrieval team has stopped, was killed by something.
3794000	3796000	This is, and the Americans take over the wreckage.
3796000	3800000	Now, it's still not clear if the Mexican retrieval team was
3800000	3804000	killed from some sort of leakage from the craft or that the
3804000	3805000	US killed them.
3805000	3806000	And still, this is just a story.
3806000	3808000	There's not a lot of evidence for that case.
3808000	3810000	I covered it because it's so interesting.
3810000	3814000	But so we have, we have the Sentinels of Ether story.
3814000	3819000	We have the 2004 John Stuart, supposed whistleblower.
3819000	3823000	And then we have the 1974 Koyame instant, which all kind of tie in
3823000	3824000	together.
3824000	3826000	It's an extremely interesting story.
3826000	3829000	I'll be interested to see if John Stuart has a further comment on
3829000	3830000	this.
3830000	3832000	As far as I know, he hasn't said very much.
3832000	3836000	I think people have just kind of been, I think he's just kind of
3836000	3839000	been saying like, haha, like I got it.
3839000	3841000	I think he's just kind of been celebrating the victory on her.
3841000	3844000	We still don't know if his whistleblower is telling the truth.
3844000	3847000	I think that this person kind of went AWOL and AFK after this
3847000	3851000	and John tried to follow up with him, but there wasn't, but there
3851000	3854000	wasn't, he couldn't get in contact with the guy.
3854000	3858000	So let's, if there's any questions now, let's, let's go through them.
3858000	3861000	I just kind of wanted to touch on that because I felt like a lot of
3861000	3865000	people were drawing to attention to the, to John Stuart's
3865000	3868000	locking Martin whistleblower, but there was some parts of the
3868000	3871000	puzzle missing to factor in Sentinels of Ether and the 1974
3871000	3873000	Koyame incident.
3873000	3875000	So, yeah.
3875000	3878000	So if anybody has any questions, we'll, we'll kind of go through
3878000	3881000	that and maybe in about like 10, 15 minutes, we'll, we'll start
3881000	3882000	wrapping up.
3882000	3886000	I'm, I'm trying to think of any other kind of breaking into
3886000	3887000	incidents right now.
3887000	3890000	I would like to know what you guys think of imminent so far.
3890000	3892000	Again, I haven't read the full thing.
3892000	3896000	I've mostly been catching up on loose media appearances so far.
3896000	3899000	And okay, let's, let's, let's see this.
3899000	3902000	Michael says, Ross has definitely been in touch with me on
3902000	3905000	some details, not too much since he's busy, but soon I expect to
3905000	3907000	meet with him and tell him face to face.
3907000	3911000	Now I would really be interested to see what Ross and Michael
3911000	3912000	discuss.
3912000	3916000	If everybody remembers Ross's previous AMA, somebody asked him
3916000	3918000	like, what do you think of the Michael Herrera case?
3918000	3920000	And he says he was actively investigating.
3920000	3924000	So I'm really excited to hear further developments on that.
3924000	3926000	So that's wildly exciting.
3926000	3929000	Let me get a sip of water here.
3930000	3936000	So yeah, besides that guys, again, I'm hoping to, I'm hoping to
3936000	3938000	see Jesse Michaels quite soon.
3938000	3942000	I think he's, I think he's coming out to the state and I'm excited to
3942000	3943000	meet up with him.
3943000	3948000	We are working on the, I kind of leaked it.
3948000	3952000	I don't really like to say it, but let's, let's, the group I
3952000	3955000	encountered is private, but plucked from former special operations
3955000	3956000	groups.
3956000	3958000	I know some of them personally, but they are good guys helping me
3958000	3959000	with that.
3959000	3960000	Yeah.
3960000	3961000	Yeah.
3961000	3962000	Yeah.
3962000	3963000	Yeah.
3963000	3964000	Yeah.
3964000	3965000	Yeah.
3965000	3966000	Yeah.
3966000	3968000	And that's something I wanted to talk on.
3968000	3971000	Remember in the Arrow historical report volume one, they claimed
3971000	3974000	that Michael said to them that he encountered us special forces.
3974000	3977000	No, and Michael has been clear about this since the beginning
3977000	3980000	that he encountered a private team that had no association that
3980000	3983000	he knew at the time from American special forces.
3983000	3985000	Let's, okay, let's start going through these.
3985000	3987000	I'm catching this room a bit late, but I'm so lost.
3987000	3988000	I'm not on all this.
3988000	3992000	I thoughts on all this about I, but tell me why you're lost.
3992000	3993000	Man, I'll get you up.
3993000	3994000	I'm sorry.
3994000	3995000	I know I can drag on a bit.
3995000	3997000	That's why I like to make scripts because I can just drone on
3997000	4000000	about AI designating designing craft and military being infiltrated
4000000	4003000	to the point where top secret stuff needs to be hidden.
4003000	4007000	I have a, I have a good friend who actually is working on like a
4007000	4010000	really good thesis about kind of the phenomenon and, and craft
4010000	4014000	being sort of like a really AI driven and maybe like a biomechanical
4014000	4015000	artificial intelligence.
4015000	4018480	And so I would kind of like to follow up with him on that.
4020120	4024240	Pete says, imminent as part of the drip feed of disclosure,
4025760	4027640	anything cleared for official releases.
4027640	4030120	Why are they starting to disclose is the interesting part.
4030120	4031160	Yeah, I agree.
4032040	4035300	Why is, like, why does Dobser approve of Lou
4035300	4037800	discussing a 1950 crash retrieval case?
4037800	4039920	Why does Dobser approve of Lou
4039920	4042080	discussing Operation Interloper and so forth?
4042080	4042960	This is very interesting.
4042960	4044280	Everything is cleared with Dobser.
4044280	4045880	Same with David Grush as well.
4046920	4049960	The idea of a drip feed of disclosure is interesting
4049960	4054080	because, of course, there's likely elements within USG
4054080	4055680	that are deeply entwined in the program
4055680	4058280	who do not want any of this information to come out.
4059320	4061200	Is there ever a point where top secret stuff
4061200	4062040	doesn't need to be hidden?
4062040	4064080	I think, I can't remember,
4064080	4066240	but I think people like Grush and Elizondo
4066240	4068880	have a great take on this.
4068880	4070720	With NHI technology and so forth,
4070720	4073240	perhaps the technology itself
4073280	4075680	and how to operate this technology can remain classified.
4075680	4077840	You don't need someone who would wish harm to others,
4077840	4081160	being able to harness a craft that can go supersonic
4081160	4083000	in an eighth of a second.
4083000	4084960	But I think the reality of this situation
4084960	4086760	shouldn't be classified top secret.
4086760	4089640	I think all of humanity has a right to know the extent
4089640	4093520	to what program officials and people high up in USG
4093520	4096520	and the military know about UFOs,
4096520	4097680	their purpose on this planet,
4097680	4099720	their modus operandi and so forth.
4100720	4102520	What is your opinion on Salvador Pais?
4102520	4103520	Pais is super interesting.
4103520	4105880	I covered him in the Off-World Technologies Division.
4105880	4110880	He worked out of NAVAR, the Naval Air Facility in Maryland.
4110880	4115520	And he, of course, has patents on kind of almost like a
4115520	4117720	kind of quantum vacuum fluctuations,
4117720	4120920	powering like an almost diamond or triangular shaped craft.
4120920	4123320	If you haven't, I really recommend listening to his appearance
4123320	4125320	on Kurt Geimungal's theory of everything
4125320	4127520	where he talks a little bit more about physics.
4127720	4129720	Physics was never my strong suit, so I'm not,
4129720	4134320	I don't have a ton of interesting things to add there,
4134320	4136920	but Salvador Pais is super interesting.
4136920	4138920	And I find his patents wild,
4138920	4140720	especially how they were initially denied,
4140720	4142720	but they were picked up by the Navy.
4142720	4145520	And he was working out of NAVAR, Pax River.
4145520	4146920	What's up, OptiV? How you doing, man?
4146920	4147920	Great to see you.
4147920	4149320	Great to see you, brother.
4150520	4152720	Danny Sheehan answered Mitchell's question
4152720	4153920	in Jesse Michaels' interview.
4153920	4155720	He said it's because Lockheed wants the license to tech
4155720	4156720	and sell it.
4156720	4159720	Okay, I haven't, I don't remember that part,
4159720	4161720	but thank you for saying that.
4161720	4164720	Have I been interviewed before? No, I don't know.
4164720	4165720	No, I have not.
4165720	4168720	That kind of would be fun, but as you can tell,
4168720	4171720	I kind of ramble, so we'd see how that goes.
4173720	4175720	Group C says imminent is crap.
4175720	4177720	Excuse my French, a mix of truth and lies.
4177720	4179720	That's how good disinformation works.
4179720	4181720	Lou is clear to say what he says.
4181720	4183720	Of course, there's still a lot of discourse around Lou,
4184720	4186720	ASAP, and ATIP.
4186720	4189720	If you guys haven't, I know he can be a divisive member
4189720	4192720	in the community, but John Greenwald's recent video on kind
4192720	4195720	of the memorandums and different files that have been released
4195720	4199720	from ATIP and ASAP surrounding Lou and other players.
4199720	4202720	That is super interesting, and I really highly recommend that.
4202720	4205720	It makes the can of worms so much deeper.
4205720	4207720	So please watch that.
4207720	4209720	China stand is why Kona Blue was proposed.
4209720	4211720	Lockheed went into the vest of its materials,
4211720	4213720	and Kona Blue was meant to be the way that happened,
4213720	4215720	and to the CIA put a kibosh on it.
4215720	4218720	Yeah, to divest materials into the hands
4218720	4221720	of Bigelow Aerospace from Lockheed Martin.
4221720	4223720	You got a signed copy of imminent.
4223720	4224720	That's awesome, man.
4224720	4225720	That's super cool.
4225720	4226720	That's super cool.
4226720	4228720	Since imminent had to go through the Pentagon approval
4228720	4230720	for its contents, I think the section on alien implants
4230720	4233720	is a slow drip for acknowledging abduction phenomena.
4233720	4234720	Scary thought.
4234720	4237720	Yeah, again, we talked about implants a little earlier.
4237720	4240720	I think the basis of that work needs to come off
4240720	4243720	of Dr. Lear's work throughout history,
4243720	4245720	because it's just such a strange concept
4245720	4247720	to wrap your head around, and the implications
4247720	4249720	of the abduction phenomena, if true,
4249720	4252720	are extremely disturbing as well.
4252720	4255720	Anytime someone monetizes UFO stuff,
4255720	4258720	I'm out, YouTube doesn't count for now.
4258720	4263720	So that's like the grifter argument, right?
4263720	4267720	I don't think Lou is a grifter at all.
4267720	4270720	I think that after many years, for whatever reason,
4270720	4271720	he's releasing this book.
4271720	4276720	But I do agree that a lot of people will just kind of make
4276720	4281720	a lot of UFO content or big claims for not much reason.
4281720	4284720	But I personally wouldn't throw Lou in that category,
4284720	4286720	but I still need to read all of him in it.
4286720	4290720	So my opinion is not fully formed.
4290720	4292720	I have one huge advice to you before you get into abjections
4292720	4293720	and all that.
4293720	4294720	Learn about the science.
4294720	4296720	Listen to Tom Bearden's lectures, because if you don't,
4296720	4297720	you'll think that everything is E.T.
4297720	4298720	Absolutely.
4298720	4299720	Absolutely.
4299720	4300720	Well, I appreciate that.
4300720	4302720	With any subject getting into,
4302720	4306720	I want to make sure I have a strong foundation for research.
4306720	4310720	Dobser is only there to censor classified specific details.
4310720	4312720	Lou chooses his references carefully
4312720	4313720	and tiptoes around classified details.
4313720	4314720	Yes, he does.
4314720	4316720	You can see that in the JRE interview and so forth.
4316720	4320720	Lou is very good at drawing the line where he's speculating
4320720	4322720	and not speculating and drawing the line where he can't go
4322720	4323720	further and drawing the line to say,
4323720	4325720	I can't talk about this, but here is an example.
4325720	4330720	Also, what do you guys think about the Lou on JRE appearance?
4330720	4333720	I think Lou, I think Joe was a lot softer on Lou
4333720	4334720	than he was on David Grush.
4334720	4337720	I was re-listening to the David Grush interview recently.
4337720	4341720	And Joe, a lot of the time, you see,
4341720	4346720	almost took a position of disbelief to everything Grush said,
4346720	4349720	which was a little strange to me, a little strange.
4349720	4352720	Kelly Cahill is where to start looking for abductions.
4352720	4355720	Gotcha.
4355720	4357720	Gotcha.
4357720	4359720	Do you know of any other good UAP YouTubers?
4359720	4362720	Watch all of your vids and want more info.
4362720	4368720	So I don't watch too much UFO related content.
4368720	4371720	And part of the reason I made this channel is I thought there was
4371720	4376720	a bit of a lapse in serious research outside of guys like Richard Dolan.
4376720	4381720	So my advice would be just to read, to be honest.
4381720	4385720	I would read Leonard Stringfield's Crash Retrievals one through seven.
4385720	4387720	Those are brilliant.
4387720	4391720	I would read Stephen Greer's disclosure briefing document from 2001.
4391720	4394720	I would read Magic Eyes Only by Ryan Wood.
4394720	4397720	I would read In Plain Sight by Ross Colthart.
4397720	4402720	But I would also watch Ross Colthart interviews on the kind of need to know
4402720	4405720	as well as anything he's done with Bryce Zabel.
4405720	4409720	There's also a lot of good old documentaries such as stuff with James Fox.
4409720	4412720	So as far as content goes, I don't know.
4412720	4418720	I'm not too familiar with other UFO content creators besides some of the big dogs like Dolan.
4418720	4421720	Sad to hear Lou is financially hurt by TTSA.
4421720	4427720	Yeah, of course that kind of muddies up TTSA.
4427720	4429720	So what do you think about the Orbs in Lou's house?
4429720	4430720	I find it very strange.
4430720	4435720	Kind of he really doesn't hesitate to go into kind of like the Hitchhiker effect of UAP
4435720	4438720	and strange stuff following him home from work at ATV.
4438720	4441720	I think even his wife commented on this as well.
4441720	4446720	I'll have to find her comments, but that was really interesting to see her wife talk about that.
4446720	4448720	Matt's under his correction.
4448720	4451720	Danny Sheehan, tiptoes and whispers to Lou.
4451720	4452720	Back to Pete.
4452720	4456720	And abductions are the hardest part to swallow once the realization of UAP is real.
4456720	4457720	It's terrifying.
4457720	4458720	I agree.
4458720	4460720	The implications of abductions are very terrifying.
4460720	4464720	I remember growing up that one of the first books I had was a book on Betty and Barty Hill,
4464720	4467720	and it just scared the life out of me as a kid.
4467720	4472720	John Greenwald clearly has a theory about why, in his words, both sides are lying.
4472720	4475720	Do you have any thoughts on what John's theory may be?
4475720	4481720	Yeah, I think in his latest video, he says very specifically, neither side is telling the truth.
4481720	4486720	And this could just be, like I can't think for John, of course.
4486720	4488720	Even though I don't always agree with everything he says,
4488720	4490720	I think John is a pretty well thought out person.
4490720	4492720	He takes his time to craft his theses.
4492720	4495720	So I would wait to hear from him, but of course this could possibly be,
4495720	4500720	he just thinks this is room to muddy the water around the UAP discussion
4500720	4503720	and create endless debate about atyp and asap.
4503720	4505720	I talked about this already, but how is Japan?
4505720	4508720	Japan was the greatest place I've ever been and has the best food I've ever had.
4508720	4510720	I want to go back so bad.
4510720	4514720	I didn't get to go to Kodokanjudo in Tokyo and I went to so bad.
4514720	4515720	So bad.
4515720	4520720	It was obviously a PR deal and Joe didn't take it seriously with Grush or Lou.
4520720	4522720	Yeah, it was strange that he didn't take it seriously.
4522720	4526720	I think that David Grush is one of the most valuable people to speak to right now.
4526720	4528720	So it was strange.
4528720	4529720	It was bizarre, Lou.
4529720	4532720	I think he made a conscious effort and he talked about this on JRE,
4532720	4535720	that he was on JRE to talk about the phenomenon and not plug his own book,
4535720	4538720	which I definitely respect, but he gave John Greenwald a huge shout out.
4538720	4541720	And I know that Greenwald has had his huge problems
4541720	4543720	and has been very outspoken about Lou.
4543720	4546720	So that was interesting to see.
4546720	4550720	I think it's curious how all the Senate hearings started right after the Chinese balloon.
4550720	4555720	What are the odds that UAP topic is used as a vehicle to pass reforms with that deal with foreign stuff?
4555720	4560720	I do not think so because if we look at the Schumann legislation for both 2023 and 2024,
4560720	4567720	it is very, very, very clear that the subject we're dealing with is non-human technology and legacy programs.
4567720	4568720	Very clear.
4568720	4576720	I think in the 2024 NDAA, non-human intelligence has mentioned about 27 times, I think it is.
4576720	4579720	I feel like him not plugging his book was partially to avoid.
4579720	4580720	Yeah, yeah.
4580720	4581720	I agree.
4581720	4582720	I agree.
4582720	4585720	Timothy Good's Unearthly Disclosure is an excellent book.
4585720	4586720	Yes.
4586720	4588720	And was it Timothy Good that also wrote above?
4588720	4591720	They're not above Top Secret.
4591720	4594720	Need to know was that his book, but Timothy Good is great.
4594720	4595720	I can't remember right now.
4595720	4599720	If Lou can do remote view, why doesn't he hold a bit of demonstrations?
4599720	4601720	Unlike UFO UAP, he has control on that.
4601720	4605720	I would like to see demonstrations from people who claim they can operate remote viewing.
4605720	4607720	I feel such a strange territory for me.
4607720	4609720	I'd really like to see that.
4609720	4611720	First thought was a skunk work spying on him.
4611720	4616720	I'd like to understand the technology behind those dang orbs then, especially if they can operate indoors.
4616720	4620720	I have a three paragraph argument regarding UAP origins and the phenomena of abductions.
4620720	4623720	If anyone is interested to see it, where could I post?
4623720	4631720	My friend, you could email that to me at uapgrub at gmail.com or you could join my discord and post that to see.
4631720	4636720	I'll copy that and put the link in one more time because I'd love to read it.
4636720	4637720	I'd absolutely love to read it.
4637720	4639720	Sounds awesome.
4639720	4641720	Lou's wife was in the News Nation interview.
4641720	4643720	Okay.
4643720	4645720	The grifter argument makes no sense.
4645720	4646720	Take Greer, for example.
4646720	4648720	He does two CE5 events a year.
4648720	4649720	He's not a millionaire.
4649720	4650720	How can he fund the disclosure project?
4650720	4653720	Whistleblower needs his events with no money.
4654720	4662720	I bet Greer, I do think that Greer has income streams outside of just UAP if I had to guess.
4662720	4666720	I know he used to be a practicing ER trauma doctor, but I'm not sure.
4666720	4672720	Mike says, I'm not sure why, but it seems very human that the orbs followed him after he was investigating from within the Pentagon.
4672720	4675720	That's very strange.
4675720	4677720	I need to read that passage in imminent.
4677720	4681720	Again, sort of like with remote viewing and stuff, that territory is very foreign for me.
4682720	4688720	I approach it slowly when I read about it because it's uncomfortable for me, which I'm sure it is for many of you.
4688720	4690720	What is your methodology for conducting research?
4690720	4692720	That is a really good question.
4692720	4694720	I really appreciate that.
4694720	4705720	When I'm investigating a crash retrieval, for example, I will find a respected person that has covered this crash retrieval before.
4705720	4712720	For example, for the 1974 case in Koyame, Mexico, that was Ryan Wood in Magic Eyes Only.
4712720	4714720	He covered the case.
4714720	4717720	I use that as a starting point.
4717720	4722720	From that, I make a personal note sheet for myself of every single aspect I want to check out.
4722720	4728720	Then every single aspect, for example, Koyame mentions Fort Bliss and stuff like that.
4728720	4734720	I will go look at ufo-search.com, which is a great website by Richard Geldreich.
4734720	4738720	I can't remember that post events by date.
4738720	4745720	I will start researching if there's any blue book, sorry, not blue book, but any recorded sightings or information on that day.
4745720	4750720	If any official documents have been released about aspects of Fort Bliss and operations there on that day,
4750720	4754720	or any official documents exist around that case, I'll analyze the Moondust Archive.
4754720	4756720	I'll analyze the Blue Book Archive.
4756720	4761720	I'll analyze if any popular figures on UAP disclosure have talked about this.
4761720	4764720	Then I'll start researching the subject I'm working on in books.
4764720	4771720	For example, I know when I covered a ufo case, I had to go into some of Jacques Valet's old works.
4771720	4776720	My research always conducts with starting a foundational layer and topics I want to branch out on,
4776720	4783720	and using various websites and books to find out more information and continue that as a decision tree.
4783720	4790720	The most important part for my research, as I'm sure it would be for anybody, is really good record keeping,
4790720	4794720	because there's so much you can find when researching any case.
4794720	4799720	What's important to me is to have bullet points for subjects and appropriate links,
4799720	4805720	and from there have even further offshoots and just dive into what I find interesting about the cases.
4805720	4812720	Then when I can form a thesis, I'll start to think how I can write a topic when using my references and evidence.
4812720	4817720	I'm an engineer by trait, so I approach each script as I would, like an engineering research paper,
4817720	4827720	kind of like an introduction, an abstract, the data, the investigation, the conclusion, the references, and so forth.
4827720	4831720	Keep up the great work. Thank you, man. You're one of the very few people that do thorough research.
4831720	4836720	You're like Richard Dolan in his early days, and not only not as naive. I appreciate that. I love you too, man.
4836720	4840720	Thank you so much. I love doing this. This topic is so multifaceted.
4840720	4846720	It's so tough to kind of get to the bottom of anything, so I'm just kind of trying to do my part,
4846720	4851720	slowing things down, analyze things on a case-by-case or topic-by-topic basis.
4851720	4854720	Steph says, hey, Grubb, appreciate you for life, brother, and thank you, man.
4854720	4858720	I'm sure thousands of us feel the same. What do you think the phenomena actually is?
4858720	4861720	What's your theory so far if you could share? Sorry if asked.
4861720	4864720	So this has always been really interesting.
4864720	4869720	I've always kind of bounced between the thought of extraterrestrials versus
4869720	4872720	what some people like to refer to as, like, ultra-terrestrials,
4872720	4880720	a.k.a. beams that may not exist in our three dimensions, spatial dimensions, and one temporal dimension.
4880720	4888720	Lately, I've found quite a bit of credible testimony that refers to crashed craft as specifically extraterrestrial.
4888720	4893720	So there could be a combination of a presence on this planet, extraterrestrial,
4893720	4897720	and some things that don't necessarily exist in maybe a corporeal body
4897720	4900720	or what we would think as a physical being.
4900720	4907720	But right now, if I just had to think out loud and just kind of say,
4907720	4910720	here's what I think for crash retrievals and these crashed craft,
4910720	4916720	right now I lean more towards just a pure extraterrestrial source.
4916720	4920720	Another thing I feel could be possible is that these craft, through its own AI,
4920720	4923720	may be able to access psychic wavelengths themselves.
4923720	4925720	What explain a lot of behaviors that people have experienced?
4925720	4930720	Yeah, absolutely. Find various methodologies and kind of,
4930720	4934720	I don't know what sort of wave, maybe radio waves,
4934720	4937720	a frequency that can start to distort cognition and so forth.
4937720	4940720	Yeah, I agree with you. I think that's a great point.
4940720	4943720	I wrote it over at post-disclosure. Where can we find that, my friend?
4943720	4946720	I'd love to see it.
4946720	4949720	When are you going to upload the video on the glass ball that reacted to consciousness?
4949720	4953720	I have uploaded that. That is the Off-World Technologies Division.
4953720	4958720	Now, there is an individual that I am speaking to and that's really great
4958720	4962720	that has also claimed to have observed such a thing.
4962720	4967720	So I hope I have an update on that because it's very interesting.
4967720	4970720	Okay, Michael, Greer does real estate as well, so he's making money with that.
4970720	4972720	Not sure if he does that as much. Perfect.
4972720	4977720	Okay, we know that besides just CE5, that Greer has other streams of income.
4977720	4981720	Sorry, I wrote it over at post-disclosure, but so far no one is reading it.
4981720	4985720	Hey, post it over here. Post in the Discord, man. People here, we take this seriously.
4985720	4989720	People will want to read this. I promise you, man, I certainly will.
4989720	4994720	He then talked to the CIA guy and Joe seemed like he doubted the whole UAP thing, not going to lie.
4995720	5001720	Yeah, Mike Baker always seems to pop up whenever Joe talks to a UAP guy.
5001720	5006720	Mike Baker, I've seen a lot of comments on Reddit and so forth saying that Mike Baker is his handler.
5006720	5013720	I think that's hilarious. I think Mike Baker has appeared on JRE 14 times, which is a lot.
5013720	5016720	So, you know, whatever.
5016720	5021720	Zach, that English dude tried pretty hard to nail Lou down to no avail.
5021720	5024720	I didn't love Lou's answers, makes it sound like he wants to stop corruption,
5024720	5026720	but also won't point out what the corruption is.
5026720	5029720	That's the English channel, the sort of smaller channel.
5029720	5033720	Props to that guy for getting an interview with Lou. That's really cool to hear.
5033720	5036720	I haven't listened to that yet, so I absolutely will.
5036720	5039720	I know a couple clips of that are going around now.
5039720	5042720	Spoonbending parties, isn't that Yuri Geller's claim?
5042720	5045720	If I'm remembering correctly, the spoonbending.
5045720	5051720	Why would an interdimensional capable ET race abduct humans and put implants in them to track them, et cetera?
5051720	5052720	It's a very human thing.
5052720	5055720	ETs don't need it and they can do it without physical contact.
5055720	5063720	Yeah, I mean, there's so many, whenever you reach hypothesis like extraterrestrial or even ultra dimensional or something like that,
5063720	5064720	there's still so many questions.
5064720	5067720	I know one of my good friends who really thinks this,
5067720	5073720	the whole phenomenon comes down to a sort of advanced planetary AI that originates from outside our solar system.
5073720	5077720	He's got a lot to add here.
5077720	5081720	I think everybody on this planet has their own UFO stories.
5081720	5083720	I mean, a lot of people do.
5083720	5087720	I never really talk about it because to me, just a single witness testimony, there's not much to it.
5087720	5093720	I, of course, multiple times in my life have just seen lights in the sky making very sharp turns, not satellites,
5093720	5096720	because I'm always very careful to pay attention to that.
5096720	5101720	Bright lights that seem to make angles are kind of dart around in the sky.
5101720	5104720	I don't pay too much attention because I have no confirming evidence.
5104720	5106720	I have no kind of multi-sensor detection.
5106720	5112720	But I, you know, I like, I'd say a lot of people have seen strange things in the sky.
5112720	5116720	Kudos for remaining open-minded and getting into the personal infighting that plays the community.
5116720	5117720	Yeah, man.
5117720	5124720	I've noticed on Twitter, there's a lot of, a heck of a lot of drama, especially around Lou, so much drama.
5124720	5127720	I don't know how you could investigate fighting like that.
5127720	5131720	So I don't, I don't want to get into that.
5131720	5134720	Chris Bledsoe, I don't really have an opinion right now.
5134720	5137720	I'm reserving judgment for doing a deeper dive on, on Chris.
5137720	5146720	I've heard favorable and unfavorable things about Mr. Bledsoe, but right now I do not have much, much to go on.
5146720	5148720	Am I skeptical about remote viewing?
5148720	5149720	It's highly skeptical to me.
5149720	5151720	This is such a, this is a great question.
5151720	5156720	If you asked me a couple of months ago, I'd say a lot of the woo connected with the phenomenon is like a very strange.
5156720	5164720	Over time, just reading kind of the research papers from SRI and SAIC, listening to David Grush talk about Stargate and now Lou.
5164720	5169720	And even people I trust like Ryan Wood even commented on remote viewing and so forth.
5169720	5174720	I, I find that I, I've never observed any instance of remote viewing.
5174720	5175720	I cannot do it.
5175720	5176720	I don't know anybody that can.
5176720	5181720	So I've not seen evidence, but my mind is a lot more open to it than before.
5181720	5187720	Of course, the more you study the UFOs, the more kind of strange things and psychic phenomena get introduced.
5187720	5190720	So it's, it's, it's very tough to separate the two.
5190720	5191720	It's very interesting.
5191720	5199720	And like I always say, it's a really kind of uncomfortable territory for me because I've never interacted with anybody who claims to have psionic abilities or be psychic.
5199720	5203720	So I would really like to see a remote viewing demonstration if I'm being honest.
5203720	5205720	Have I read loose threads by Omega point?
5205720	5208720	I have not my friend, but I will write that down because that sounds.
5209720	5210720	Any book.
5210720	5212720	I will absolutely read.
5212720	5213720	Thank you.
5213720	5216720	The hitchhiker effect is a real thing, not just with UAP agreed.
5216720	5222720	Tom Bearden explains in detail down to the equations, how to make orbs and anti-gravity craft in one of his lecturers called psychotronics.
5222720	5223720	It's on YouTube.
5223720	5225720	I have, I've not watched that lecture.
5225720	5228720	So I, I got, I got some good homework to do.
5230720	5231720	Thank you.
5231720	5232720	Let's always the real deal.
5232720	5233720	All right.
5233720	5242720	Then I will, I will continue to research and when I spend some time to sit down with Chris, have you seen one of the new Ross cold heart reality checks with MJ 12?
5242720	5245720	It gave credential to MJ 12 because of the 2022 JFK.
5245720	5246720	Yes, I have.
5246720	5248720	And that was with the Australian gentleman.
5248720	5249720	That was fantastic.
5249720	5255720	In my MJ 12 document, I kind of referenced it because Lou had just talked about it.
5255720	5258720	It kind of really renewed interest in MJ 12 and JFK.
5258720	5259720	Fantastic.
5259720	5262720	Ross is, Ross does some really great work.
5262720	5264720	And that Australian researcher is awesome too.
5264720	5268720	That dude was recalling facts off the top of his head, like nobody's business.
5268720	5270720	First, all your chain are covering the UFO flag.
5270720	5271720	Hey, cool.
5271720	5272720	That was forever ago.
5272720	5274720	It looks to just too odd to be fake.
5274720	5276720	Watch it on loop sometimes.
5276720	5277720	You know what?
5277720	5283720	Now after the claims of Lou, I'd like, and of course, Grush last year, I'd like to see some of that dang 4k satellite footage.
5283720	5286720	Who would you say is the John Mack of today?
5286720	5287720	That's a great question.
5287720	5288720	I have no idea.
5288720	5292720	I don't know if anybody is doing the serious work today that kind of John Mack did.
5292720	5297720	John Mack was really ahead of his time, took the abduction phenomenon so seriously.
5297720	5300720	I really respect John Mack's work.
5300720	5302720	The Wilson Davis was pretty much known to be real.
5302720	5304720	Yes, but he finally confirmed it in Facebook group.
5304720	5307720	I feel bad for him because he had to take the hit on some trustworthiness with his clearance.
5307720	5308720	Yes.
5308720	5315720	I think a lot of people kind of saw the validity in the Wilson Davis memo, including the context around it and so forth.
5315720	5316720	Thank you for answering.
5316720	5317720	Thank you, man.
5317720	5318720	I appreciate that.
5318720	5320720	You take care and stay safe as well, brother.
5320720	5325720	Matt, I've been in Battelle facilities in Columbus and West Jeff, Ohio.
5325720	5331720	Do not see anything UAP related, but they def have the security and facilities to keep it hidden beyond what I could access.
5331720	5335720	I think it's Lou who discusses now for Detrick in Maryland containing biologics.
5335720	5339720	And so that's a great research avenue to go down now.
5339720	5340720	Thank you so much for all.
5340720	5341720	Thank you, Matt.
5341720	5342720	I appreciate that.
5342720	5344720	Integrity is definitely something I hold near and dear.
5344720	5349720	I may seem kind of like an idiot sometimes, but if I'm unfamiliar with the topic or something, I don't know.
5349720	5353720	I promise you, I'll always tell you if kind of my knowledge on something isn't up to snuff.
5353720	5354720	I think it's important.
5354720	5356720	I don't have all the answers to this.
5356720	5359720	I just might be well versed in some of the cases I've covered.
5359720	5362720	Shout out to I will always matter.
5362720	5369720	The chat can get the chat can get tough to read by everybody's putting in the questions to speak to me.
5369720	5372720	So I will always try to answer every single question.
5372720	5375720	The sphere does sound a lot like the the bet sphere.
5375720	5384720	What was interesting to me how this was described the sphere at this division was the sort of indent on top as if one would place a hand.
5384720	5385720	But it does.
5385720	5387720	It is similar to the the bet sphere.
5387720	5390720	Have you seen, have you dived into eyes on cinema?
5390720	5391720	Yeah.
5391720	5392720	Eyes on cinema is really good.
5392720	5396720	I don't know how the heck they get some of their their footage.
5396720	5401720	I mean, they have some great stuff down to like old interviews with Ryan Wood and Dr. Robert Wood.
5401720	5403720	I've never seen in my life before.
5403720	5404720	I don't know how they do that.
5404720	5407720	They have amazing footage.
5407720	5409720	I don't know for sure, but pretty sure you can pay.
5409720	5413720	You can pay to get to get on JRE.
5413720	5414720	Really?
5414720	5417720	That's I don't know if I'd want to go.
5417720	5418720	I don't know.
5418720	5421720	That'd be a fun experience, but I don't think I'm there yet.
5421720	5426720	I know it's far from your top priority and I really appreciate that you don't chase the algorithm, but I really hope to see you get the credit.
5426720	5427720	I hope so, man.
5427720	5430720	That'd be really cool to kind of have a bigger platform to talk about this.
5430720	5433720	But, you know, we grow, we are we are grown steady.
5433720	5438720	We're almost at 10,000 subscribers in nine, a little less than nine months.
5438720	5440720	So that's really, really great.
5440720	5442720	And shout out Michael Herrera for being a legend.
5442720	5443720	Yeah.
5443720	5444720	Thank you so much, Michael, for joining the chat.
5444720	5448720	If you're still here, that that's so awesome to see you in here.
5448720	5450720	That English dude.
5450720	5452720	You got Sean and Rob Tanner.
5452720	5453720	You know, I got Sean.
5453720	5457720	I don't even like Sean O'Malley, but sugar show is going to knock him out clean.
5458720	5461720	This upcoming weekend is a treat for sports fans.
5461720	5466720	We got one fight night Denver, which I didn't get tickets to.
5466720	5470720	And then we have fight night Gilbert Burns, Sean Brady, great fight night.
5470720	5472720	And then Sunday we got them Cincinnati bangles playing.
5472720	5476720	So I'm sorry to my girlfriend, but we're watching a lot of sports this weekend.
5476720	5477720	Thanks.
5477720	5478720	Just email it to you.
5478720	5479720	Thank you very much.
5479720	5481720	I will read it either tonight or tomorrow when I catch up with my emails.
5481720	5482720	Thank you.
5482720	5486720	OptiV because the phenomenon is real and people within the government know this.
5486720	5489720	It would be illegal for a lot of these whistleblowers to reveal too much.
5489720	5491720	They go to prison and truth remain obscured.
5491720	5494720	I think even the whistleblower protection act doesn't cover pensions.
5494720	5498720	So even whistleblowers coming forward, there's still a very real threat to how they will
5498720	5502720	provide for their family, especially after they've had a long and industrious military
5502720	5505720	or kind of intelligence or USG career.
5505720	5508720	I think that's a big concern for a lot of whistleblowers that's being overlooked.
5508720	5513720	No pension security is offered here with whistleblower protection.
5514720	5517720	How can we assume what NHI is capable of or not?
5517720	5520720	It makes sense to me that they would use implants to do detailed monitoring.
5520720	5526720	Yeah, of course, with NHI, non-human intelligence, it's very difficult to kind of attribute human
5526720	5532720	traits, human thought processes or human capabilities to something that is not human.
5532720	5539720	We know they can manipulate physics as we know it to travel almost instantaneously, accelerate
5539720	5544720	and perform feats of acceleration and deceleration that would turn humans and our best ballistic
5544720	5546720	missiles into piles of grease.
5546720	5552720	So, yeah, to kind of assume what they're capable or not capable of is tough speculation.
5552720	5556720	Anytime any topic gets a lot of clicks, eyeballs, you will get those who want to take advantage
5556720	5557720	of it just don't be a fool.
5557720	5558720	Yeah, I agree.
5558720	5562720	That's why I tend not to do like news of the day type stuff.
5562720	5567720	I like to sit back and really spend my time researching stuff and really spend my time
5567720	5568720	focusing on one case at a time.
5568720	5573720	Doing kind of the news of the day stuff, you can really get caught up in a lot of stuff
5573720	5576720	and that's just not really my style either.
5576720	5577720	Michael says, thank you to Pete.
5577720	5581720	I'm just a guy who talked about some crazy stuff and that happened.
5581720	5583720	Little did I know how much we connect the dots.
5583720	5584720	Thank you, Michael.
5584720	5586720	Mr. T. What's up, man?
5586720	5587720	How you doing?
5587720	5590720	Whitley Streber's implants given the ability to pull up information about anything in his
5590720	5592720	vision while he's writing.
5592720	5594720	That sounds like the eyes from the Black Mirror episode.
5594720	5600720	Do you know the episode where the, the some husband like it gets blocked by his wife also
5600720	5602720	in white Christmas?
5602720	5606720	Is it true you grew up within walking distance to Lockheed in Littleton says Jim Shoe?
5606720	5608720	Yes, I did.
5608720	5612720	The Lockheed Deer Creek facility in Littleton was walking distance.
5612720	5616720	It's nestled within the start of the Rocky Mountains right after what we call the Hogback,
5616720	5619720	which is where two tectonic plates push up against each other.
5619720	5622720	Rumor has it that facility goes deep into the mountains.
5622720	5628720	I lived about a four minute, five minute walk from one of Lockheed's biggest, biggest locations.
5628720	5629720	Thank you for all you do.
5629720	5630720	I appreciate it.
5630720	5631720	Thank you, my brother.
5631720	5633720	I will answer any question.
5633720	5636720	UFOs seem to be becoming a gateway to witchcraft.
5636720	5642720	A lot more people are starting to kind of dive into kind of like a more woo as people call it,
5642720	5645720	like a psionic stuff, psychic stuff as they talk about UFOs.
5645720	5648720	It's actually really exploded this year.
5648720	5650720	So I do agree with you.
5650720	5652720	Have you watched the Men Who Stare at Goats?
5652720	5653720	Great movie about remote view.
5653720	5655720	I haven't seen that since it was in theaters, man.
5655720	5657720	That is a good movie, Men Who Stare at Goats.
5657720	5659720	I need to watch that again.
5659720	5661720	I highly recommend Loose Threads.
5661720	5663720	I will be reading it, my friend.
5663720	5666720	I would highly recommend you watch the Joe McGonagall interview on Sean Ryan.
5666720	5667720	Absolutely.
5667720	5669720	I love Sean Ryan's projects.
5669720	5670720	Absolutely.
5670720	5671720	That sounds great.
5671720	5674720	Have you noticed the sudden rise in USO stuff now?
5674720	5675720	Yes.
5675720	5679720	Since Timothy Gallaudet has spoken about it, there's a lot of buzz about USO.
5679720	5681720	This is a great topic.
5681720	5683720	I hope it really starts to get covered.
5683720	5689720	I know a lot of guys like Green Wall or sorry, Green Street and McWest like to point to a
5689720	5695720	new video of a transmedial concept for a Chinese drone being behind all USO sightings.
5695720	5696720	But no, sir.
5696720	5700720	We have done a couple of USO videos on this channel and some USO cases are some of the
5700720	5701720	most interesting.
5701720	5705720	I think back to Kevin Knuth at the Seoul Foundation who discussed a case where a USO
5705720	5710720	traveled under a New Zealand destroyership knocking out all the power.
5710720	5713720	I had a great conversation with this about my family the other night.
5713720	5717720	My younger brother asked where to start and your channel, Red Panic Wallace, intro videos
5717720	5718720	were my number one picks.
5718720	5719720	Thank you, man.
5719720	5722720	Red Panic Wallace, his documentaries are classics.
5722720	5723720	Those are fantastic.
5723720	5724720	They're so good.
5724720	5725720	They're so good.
5725720	5728720	Max Barr, have I looked into the gate program?
5728720	5730720	Ross Colhart mentioned it in an AMA a few days ago.
5730720	5734720	Not yet, but that is on my list of stuff to research after I finish.
5734720	5740720	I've worked with Kecksburg in a certain private corporation that Mr. Kermit has also helped
5740720	5741720	me look into.
5741720	5747720	RV is very real and it's so easily allowable that people deny it.
5747720	5751720	I really want to see remote viewing demonstration.
5751720	5756060	I struggled with it because I've never personally been able to do such a thing or have viewed
5756060	5760720	it, but I would really love to see situations of remote viewing.
5760720	5762220	My mind is open to it.
5762220	5763720	I really want to see it.
5763720	5767960	Please quit your day job to do this full-time. I'd love to if the if the bills can be paid that be
5768680	5774920	That'd be great. Do you think mj-12 could be a scythe for the us created for russia? That is the claim of
5775480	5777480	Mr. John B. Alexander
5778840	5781640	If you recognize if you recognize the
5782360	5785160	likely reality of ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering
5785400	5790920	It does not make sense to me to create a program for the russians to draw attention to ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering
5791240	5793160	especially how
5793160	5797800	how the majestic files reference so much of roswell and and other cases and
5798280	5800440	Vannevar bush and some key players who were
5801160	5806360	You know even outside of their association with mj-12 general nathan twining really senior us guys
5807160	5809400	It seems strange to me to bring a lot of attention to them
5809400	5815400	So maybe some documents could be but i struggle to personally see how the whole set of mj-12 documents as a whole could be
5815800	5817800	Used for russian disinformation
5819080	5822600	Writing you now re eric mitchell. Please keep an eye. Yes, absolutely
5823720	5828920	What do you think of warner von bran's warning that one day will be told ufo's are a threat which happens since 2017
5831240	5837800	Yeah, the the threat narrative that weaves in with project blue beam if if i'm correct, right a lot of people like to
5838840	5840680	point to
5840680	5846360	Reagan's speech re says i think of a world where like our nations would be united under the threat of an alien invasion
5847080	5852280	Uh, I think it's interesting. I definitely think lu and the ttsa guys more so than somebody like grush
5852600	5854600	kind of, um discuss the
5855800	5857800	Danger of uap
5858760	5866040	Which I I I don't really have an opinion there, but I do notice that that lu discusses more of the danger of uap and I find it very interesting
5867080	5869080	Very interesting
5870760	5875880	Do you bother with ancient text or religious references that seem like uap or strictly to docks from the last 100 years?
5876200	5881000	No, when I when I first started talking to my friends about this because my channel first started like a huge
5881160	5882200	PowerPoint for my friends
5882200	5886040	I think it ended up being like 300 slides before I said i'm just going to make videos
5886040	5888520	I prefer more time spent on individual topics
5888840	5895240	I did reference many cases from before the past 100 years including the settings over nuremberg the 1897
5895720	5897720	aurora texas supposed an incident
5898200	5901640	Some interesting lights seen in like 1100 in jerusalem and so forth
5901640	5906440	So there's a lot of really interesting sightings over the course of history the san diego sphere
5907160	5912600	By yes, the the full like 17 video 17 minute video by it's redacted is great
5912840	5913800	The san diego sphere
5913800	5918200	It seems to be like a small metallic sphere with like a row of of almost like black portholes around it
5918200	5922680	Even though there's nothing to signify there's lights, but with three or two or three almost antennae often
5923080	5925640	I recommend going to watch that video. It's it's really interesting
5927000	5929400	I get the feeling we maybe do for a mass public UFO sighting
5929400	5931400	They just seem to have happened every decade or two within the last
5931480	5934680	I can think of being the 2006 oh hair UFO just before smartphones
5934680	5940760	That'd be great if we could get something a modern day like the 1952 UFOs over washington dc. That'd be fantastic
5941880	5947080	After reading loose book I'm taking a remote viewing more seriously, but I'm disappointed with russell targ's third eye spies
5947400	5951080	Hopefully there are some other resources giving us a working model now. I'd like to know
5952120	5956280	If you're starting to dive into the topic of remote viewing what sort of sources are you?
5957000	5960360	Reading about and so forth. So I might be able to piggyback off some of that research
5960440	5966040	I need to kind of understand more of about where to start besides just reading the research papers from sri
5966120	5968520	And s a i c and stargate and so forth
5969160	5973720	Tanner, yes, you have been here since the get go man. I remember you commenting on the first video
5973800	5977400	So I really really really appreciate it really appreciated
5978600	5980520	What topic would you introduce to joe?
5981160	5985000	I would just want to talk about crash retrievals for like three hours to be honest
5985320	5990840	I know we talk about many topics here, but the sort of similar to ryan wood crash retrievals is what I
5991400	5997160	View as my bread and butter for investigation. There's nothing more that I love than looking into a crash retrieval case
5999000	6006920	Uh sick card this week. Yeah, the the uh brady burns card is very good and also uh haggardy and superluck and Denver on one
6006920	6008840	That's a great one championship. Zach
6008840	6013480	Oh, and if you don't use it you need to get the hour breakdown of the wilson davis memo richard dolin does with mr
6013480	6015960	X who I think is travis taylor they go into every single detail
6016840	6021240	Oh, that sounds great. Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen that that sound. I would love to watch that
6022760	6025880	We'll be seeing you a few years in jerry as a legitimate boots on the ground
6025880	6030760	I'd love that and I'd also love to uh, you guys know joe does jiu jitsu. He's a blockbot
6030760	6034440	I'd love to roll around with him a little bit joe is a short stocky man
6034520	6036360	So he could probably give me some trouble on the mats
6037400	6041720	O'Malley has grown on me. I agree, but o'malley is nasty with his striking
6042040	6045480	I mean anybody but cheeto vera with a titanium skull would have gotten
6046120	6051880	Eviscerated by that knee up the middle. O'Malley's a beast. He looks like a sideshow attraction, but he's a beast
6053160	6058120	I will continue. I can't continue to believe youtube is effing with your channel. Come on. You should be well over 50k
6058120	6061080	Do you think anyone? No, I don't want to go. I don't want to go into
6062360	6065000	Subjects like that. Maybe it's just difficult. Maybe there's
6066040	6070920	There needs to be over time. There will be more of a growth and interest in the uap topic. So
6071880	6073880	We'll see we won't we won't go into that
6074360	6076040	We won't go into that now
6076040	6080760	Now I remember when bob lasar was on jerry. He also talked about a sphere that was an s4 when I had a dent
6081160	6084120	Really, I don't remember that. I'm going to look back at that now
6085000	6091880	I remember back when that uh, I think it was 2019 if I'm remembering when bob and uh, jeremy corbel went on jerry. That was awesome
6093160	6097800	What are your views on philip j corso's claims the day after roswell is a very interesting book
6097800	6105000	And I've been told recently by somebody very credible that I just got in contact with and I'm talking to to make specific note of
6105560	6110120	What corso states uh happened with the technology gleaned off the roswell craft?
6110120	6115160	So I'm actively pursuing some investigations off of corso's work right now if that answers the question
6116760	6120280	I got to say this chat. Yeah, this chat is this chat is great. I mean we got
6120680	6125000	Mr. Michael Herrera in the chat talking to people we've got people asking great comments
6125800	6133240	This chat is lovely. I've been in other chats where people are just saying wild stuff. So I very very very much appreciate this
6133240	6135880	Have I ever spoken to jessie michaels? Yes jessie michaels is my friend
6136520	6139000	I jessie michaels is such a cool dude
6140360	6143160	He first got in contact with him on my kingman video and
6143720	6148200	Maybe this week I will be hanging out with jessie michaels this week or next and I can't wait jessie's awesome
6148200	6152920	He's done so much for this subject made so many great videos. I really can't wait
6153880	6158840	One thing about ai is that it needs to be taught constantly any chance you think the internet is how it studies us
6158920	6165240	That would from a from an ai studying the internet would be the perfect way to kind of understand the zeitgeist of humanity
6165560	6171240	Now would I be worried that an ai would be looking at the internet to gleam off humans and look at the memes and all the terrible things online?
6171320	6173960	Absolutely, but I I think that that's very valid
6173960	6177640	I I think that's a great method for even the a biological based
6178120	6181880	Non-human intelligence species to simply understand humanity at a glance
6182920	6184920	Michael Herrera is a legend. He is a legend
6187080	6188760	That's weird timing
6188760	6191160	That is weird timing. I was just listening to his
6191880	6193880	Interview with william paulik the other day
6194360	6197640	Uh because I found it in the files of greer that wasn't on youtube apparently
6197640	6202680	It wasn't until paulik's death in about 2005 or 2007 that his family agreed for this to be published
6203160	6209160	william paulik talks about deep projects including implants uh for for operators and so forth made out of a
6209720	6214840	Facility near denver. This is a very interesting case and that's actually really weird timing. You bring that up
6214840	6217240	I've never seen anybody else talk about mr. Paulik
6218200	6220200	So that's great. Um
6220680	6225080	See what a michael say thanks matt. I hope what I break open soon at some point will be legendary and help
6225080	6227080	I would love that. I cannot wait to cover that
6228120	6233240	Speaking of goats big ups to all the goats in this chat. Yeah, everybody here's amazing. Thank you for for everybody
6233960	6238760	Um everybody I just joined bro. You're covering the best the best wilson davis moment majestic documents
6239160	6245320	You know, I got a shout out to everybody that has uh kind of helped me in my investigation been there for me
6245800	6250520	Uh, everybody has helped so much. So whether it be joey michael ryan wood
6251320	6256440	Mr. R. A. There's so many great guys that so many wonderful people around me
6257640	6264360	You and jesse michaels go deeper into research, uh, except for maybe richard olan jesse's video on t towns and brown is a classic
6264760	6271240	And this video with grush is a classic jesse is awesome and jesse just watched the program too. So I am so jealous of that, dude
6272760	6276840	You made me do it. You made me do a 180 on michael. Dude's a hero. Yes, sir
6277960	6282440	I'm i'm loving seeing everybody. I'm loving seeing everybody be so warm to michael in the chat. That's awesome
6283160	6287320	Makes perfect sense. It'll be in the ocean. I also bet millionaires in general have been expanding there. So it makes sense
6288040	6293880	Uh, they found a magladon or something. Yeah, I've uh started starting to really shift a lot of research into uh
6293960	6299960	Subaquatic have you ever looked into nazis going to Antarctica to advanced tech and do climate control there? Do you believe they went?
6301080	6305720	Uh, I have been I have not like serious research, but of course I've studied the the subject
6306040	6312040	I think there was a nazi Antarctic submarine base at the very least right and of course there was a nazi presence near
6312120	6315640	Argentina and so forth. So that is a really interesting avenue of research
6315640	6322200	I i'm not too well versed in advanced tech like if they tried to research de klok or something like that for but, um
6323080	6328120	Yeah, interesting good words from michael. I always encourage everyone to be highly skeptical on the subject too many people
6328680	6331160	Looking to make money and sacrifice morals agreed
6332840	6337320	Do you expect to see brand new whistleblowers in the new hearing? I hope so. Um
6338360	6340360	I haven't heard any rumors or anything
6340360	6341960	So I don't have much to add
6341960	6345960	But I would really like to see some uh first-hand whistleblowers. Maybe carl nel
6346520	6352120	Uh another person maybe carl nel grush and then two new whistleblowers with first-hand experience
6353080	6354360	uh
6354360	6356360	Okay, let's sorry
6357800	6359400	Um
6359400	6363400	Are there uap related topics you plan to avoid indefinitely?
6364120	6371400	Yeah, just community drama. Um, I won't really ever get into community drama. I think anything else in uap
6372120	6377320	Deserves a serious research of investigation. Um, so really anything. I mean we were talking about earlier
6377320	6379320	I even have my problems with steven greer, but
6380040	6381000	I
6381080	6383960	Absolutely would talk to him. I'd cover him. Uh, I'd love to do it
6384120	6389000	I will do a deep dive on the disclosure briefing document, but yeah everything but community drama
6389080	6392520	I'd I'd love to cover. I'm trying to think if there's any specific people I wouldn't cover
6393160	6394520	I don't know
6394520	6396520	I have to think about that
6397080	6404200	One theory I have is that aliens are just human animal hybrids grown because the time inside the craft goes by too quickly for any normal human to test
6405160	6408840	Human animal the human animal hybrids that is a frightening
6409400	6413480	Thought the time inside the craft goes by too quickly. That's an interesting thought you bring up
6413800	6417640	My mind is drawn to an article that was published and deleted right before the
6418200	6421400	congressional hearings in july of 2023 with david crush
6421480	6425720	It was an article written by or featuring quotes by she hand that described a craft
6426040	6430840	That a recovery team witnessed that when they went inside the interior was as large as a football field
6431240	6432040	so
6432040	6434040	That kind of subject of uh
6434040	6437000	Spatial warps with uh with craft is very interesting
6437640	6439640	Very interesting. Um
6440520	6442520	These are hard
6442600	6446280	These are hard uh to investigate and proof that her era case might be easier to prove
6446760	6451400	Yeah, we're still there's still so much of the um indonesia experience where we're still
6452280	6455880	Really actively investigate investigating a lot there
6456600	6459800	Thank you rattle keep up the support for greb. Thank you. I appreciate that michael
6461080	6465880	Scott castle interviews about his us. Oh encounter is pretty interesting surprise. It hasn't gotten more attention
6465880	6467880	I have not heard of that so i'm going to write that down
6472920	6474920	Awesome
6474920	6477160	And then in about 10 minutes we'll sign off my friends
6477160	6482280	But we'll keep getting through these uh questions and we'll we'll continue to uh, we'll continue to go through
6482680	6488200	I've suspected there's probably an nh i presence for a while now kevin knuth seems to think that an organism can survive in oceans
6488520	6492440	They can hop from planet to planet in planets that just have oceans. That's an interesting theory
6492440	6495880	Of course with uap. There's also the subject of von neumann replicating probes
6496120	6500600	If any of you guys have heard of the channel, um john michael godier. He's really physics based
6500760	6505640	He has a podcast called event horizon. Check out his channel. He always talks about von neumann probes, which is a
6505960	6512920	A method a type of self replicating probe that even like a sub facet than light civilization could expand into the galaxy and the cosmos
6512920	6515240	So yeah, a lot of interesting things there
6516040	6519720	Was roswell a real ufo crash? Um, I personally think so
6520200	6526120	I think roswell is one of the most well documented crashes and my confidence in kingman has been growing by the day
6527000	6528440	Growing by the day
6528440	6533000	Edgar mitchell was from roswell. Some of the locals told him it was real. Yes. Yes. Absolutely
6534920	6539320	Please have mh on again the fact he's here in the chat speaks volumes when there's new breaks in the case
6539880	6545320	Absolutely with joey as well can't leave joey out of it. Nuremberg was debunked for me personally by richard dolan
6545400	6550040	I think he does a great job of breaking down why it's most likely not a real event interesting
6551640	6553640	Interesting, okay
6553640	6556120	You told us you were an engineer what kind of field mechanical
6556200	6559080	But over time do less mechanical engineering more like
6559560	6564120	Service in qa when I was in university. I was told I'd be doing really cool things with math
6564680	6568680	And that was never really the case. So that's unfortunate. But that's just how it is
6569080	6571800	Um, it was fun to go to school for that
6572760	6578680	Richard dolan's wife is a noted RVer if I ever get to talk to oh eras says that as well if I talk to dolan
6578760	6581560	I'd love to hear more about that. I really would I really would
6584120	6586120	Let's see
6587640	6589400	Let's see
6589400	6594760	Isn't this remote viewing known as astral projection related to the meditation and getting into a dream state
6595240	6600120	Audits relevant here again if aliens are demonic doing remote viewing not going to be good. Yeah, I agreed there
6600120	6602120	I think the relevance occurs just with
6602520	6607240	Many claims now that's sort of like a almost like a conscious interface is needed for
6608440	6610680	Interacting with craft and piloting craft
6611240	6615640	But the extent of which there's some disturbing implications just like you've said
6617880	6621720	Jimmy akin documented his participation in a remote viewing experience in progress
6621720	6625880	He's not remote viewing but basically a hide-and-seek type experiment. That's interesting. I'm going to look into jimmy
6626200	6628200	I
6629640	6631640	Interesting thank you
6631640	6635560	I love seeing you guys talking to um, I love seeing you guys talking to michael in the comments
6636440	6638600	The half dome not a sphere. Okay. Okay
6639400	6643240	Love course those book day after roswell. Yeah, I think that's just good reading
6643320	6648760	You know with take it with a skeptical approach just like anything, but I think day after roswell is um, excellent reading
6649240	6650840	excellent reading
6650840	6652840	continue to think others are
6652920	6654920	um
6654920	6659880	I don't I don't know about that. I I've only ever had two people that have used
6660440	6666280	My content, you know in the copyright tab of youtube and I they were just making like a compilation of different like testimonies and stuff
6666760	6668760	That's fine. That's fine
6668840	6673000	Jesse's interview with g han is such a banger. It's awesome. And I know he was teasing it for a while
6673080	6676920	I remember right before he dropped it that same day a lot of people on reddit were posting
6677000	6683560	What's happening with jessie's interview with with uh, dany protect jessie michaels. Yeah, jessie michaels is awesome
6683640	6686680	The work he's doing is a sublime. It really is
6687560	6688920	um
6688920	6690520	Mr. T
6690520	6692520	discuss in scalar waves
6692600	6697800	Uh interact directly with the nucleus of an atom, which means they manipulate spacetime itself in very interesting
6698840	6703560	Ordle chow you and jessie collab set you turn me on to this channel mh go
6704120	6705240	um
6705240	6709480	On jessie and I are discussing such things. We will see I will leave that to him to discuss
6710440	6715320	Eyes on cinema has a massive library of classic ufo contents and is always adding new videos. Yeah guys
6715400	6722520	I always recommend uh keeping notifications on for eyes on cinema just for the content they post you absolutely can't find anywhere else
6722600	6724600	It's crazy
6724760	6731720	If you were to give a skeptic friend a one to three sentence summary about why the uap ufo alien phenomenon is probably real
6732680	6734680	good question
6736200	6738200	You
6739960	6741960	UFO sightings have occurred for centuries
6742600	6748760	The u.s. Government has downplayed and lied about these sightings in the robertson panel in conden report
6749960	6752280	Incredible whistleblowers have stated that
6753160	6757000	The u.s. Government and private contractors are in possession of these materials
6757640	6762360	Biggest emphasis on the second sentence. I don't need to think longer to get a better one. Sorry if this has been asked
6762360	6765720	What up debat debat debabs? What is your educational background?
6766040	6770360	I am not well spoken. I trip over my words all the time and blink all the dang time
6770600	6776120	But I am a mechanical and I have a bachelors of science and mechanical engineering. So that is my background
6777000	6781080	Is dan barish legit? I do not know I was going to cover him, but then um
6781960	6785560	I think it was the night shift posted some really long stuff on it
6785560	6789960	I haven't watched it, but I know that I think the guy's name is clint that does that channel
6789960	6793960	I know he takes his work seriously. So I bet he's got some good stuff on that
6793960	6797800	Um, I think he's probably he probably has a great stuff. I'll have to watch that
6799240	6804280	Any thoughts on the physics implications of uap and the phenomenon so physics is uh, even though I'm an engineer
6804280	6811000	This this may seem silly. I'm uh dreadful at physics like maxwellian physics was really really hard for me, but
6812120	6814120	I mainly focus on the fact like um
6815080	6820040	It's really interesting how these these crafts sort of defy physics in terms of this in their instantaneous
6820440	6825640	Acceleration deceleration trans medial ability. It almost seems like they're about they create a
6826120	6830200	space-time bubble around them that can dampen inertia to do such things and not splatter
6830200	6836520	Whatever is in the craft in the craft themselves. So physics is the physics of the craft will lead that to kevin canuth
6836840	6843320	Uh and his paper estimating flight characteristics of unidentified aerial phenomenon amazing paper highly recommend reading that
6843560	6845240	But I am not good
6845240	6849240	Interesting how the bitcoin expert predicted an uptick and disclosure activity once imminent dropped
6849320	6852600	This includes the quiet endorsement from the wilson. Interesting. I didn't know that
6855080	6861800	Thank you so much mr. Grover. I really appreciate that I wish you were jesse would solo or collab and amy escridge investigation
6862040	6868280	If I do my video on mysterious deaths around uap and individuals amy escridge will 100 be in there. Absolutely
6868280	6876680	Um, did you ever look into the am a reddit post about exo biospheric organisms from last year? Yeah, I did um
6877240	6879960	I can't recall too much, but I remember that well
6880520	6884440	Not well, but I remember that distinctly, but I need to um, I need to
6885080	6890360	Re-reference that if my name is requested in the hearing. I will testify and support from those I'm working with that'd be awesome to see
6890360	6892360	Michael testify awesome
6893240	6897160	There were claims that the nazis escaped in UFOs to Antarctica if I recall correctly
6897160	6900680	I don't know what to think about that. It's an interesting theory any theory about like a
6901240	6904840	The nazi super weapons de Glock and so forth is very interesting. I personally don't have enough
6905400	6909000	Confidence or confidence in any sort of research or backing to comment further
6909720	6911960	Chris melan pinned a couple of your episodes. What?
6913160	6914600	No, no, no, no, no, no, no
6914600	6920040	Chris melan released a signal exchange with somebody. I think he claimed was a high up a usg or
6920760	6924360	Intelligence communities for us and they were discussing the kingman crash. This was on twitter
6924360	6930120	I just responded with my video because I had just covered kingman briefly earlier and it got a lot of traction
6931960	6934680	So the nazi thing isn't true. I don't know
6936280	6940600	How do you yeah, Jordan? I see I've been done enough research. So I really don't have an opinion
6940600	6943960	How do you sort through the crap without chasing rabbit holes? That's a good question
6945560	6951240	Having a baseline of research and individuals to speak to when when I'm not quite sure about something or
6952040	6959240	Kind of just need to keep my head clear run some ideas by people, of course and euphology. There's so many rabbit holes and kind of
6959800	6961480	crap out there
6961480	6962520	and
6962520	6968520	Just kind of weighing the pros and cons of different people's testimonies and kind of just leaving footage behind I would say
6970360	6976360	Opinions on reptilians that she had mentioned. I think that John Ramirez has talked about that too cia former cia agent John Ramirez
6976600	6983240	Reptilians are a scary thought. I know I think this is very different than like the David Ike reptilian subject
6983560	6989480	That talks about reptilians being obama and other politicians, but like just a race of most reptilians
6990760	6993640	Beans and I you know, I must approach that with an open mind
6993640	6999080	We have robert sarbacher and vanavar bush commenting on insectoid like beans, which is very scary to me
6999880	7003480	I'm going to look up that power. I highly recommend it. It's on the dpi archive
7004280	7010280	Just search powellek. I think it's there. It's it's just the full raw uncut footage. I really recommend it
7011080	7015080	I meant graze on dmt as far as I can tell they fast-tracked our evolution have been here longer than we have
7016200	7020840	That is uh, that's interesting. That's like the the machine elves, right people describe what they see on dmt
7020920	7022280	Which are these
7022280	7025320	Strange entities. I think even alex jones has commented on that
7026280	7027320	Um
7027320	7031560	Anyone know what happened to the forechan whistleblower the document is pretty interesting now that we know a bit about more about
7031560	7034200	us. Oh, no idea what happened to the forechan whistleblower
7034840	7038920	I I doubt when covering it. I'll be able to track down what happened to the dude, but I
7039640	7041800	Absolutely am going to to cover the case
7043080	7046440	Have you looked into the manipulation of the accepted historical record?
7046520	7051160	Is this the the theory of phantom time that about a 300 year period between like the
7051640	7057240	High middle ages like the 1700s or like the 14 to 1700 system exist and we're actually in the 1700s
7057240	7061800	I have I've never really looked into that, but I've always as a young as a young and I found that very interesting
7061800	7064280	I think the subject if I'm getting it correctly is phantom time
7065800	7070280	I meant to say I suspected there's an nh. I present the oceans for a while now. I left it. Okay. I got you. I got you
7072360	7078200	Nuclear power uap lore is the brainchild of dr. Knuth. Maybe I should talk to dr. Knuth
7078200	7080200	I haven't spoken to him in a long time
7080200	7084280	John von Neumann also worked on the manhattan project. Yes, he did did someone
7084520	7085640	Uh
7085640	7087640	Say Richard Dolan's wife is a sub
7088200	7093000	No, I think Richard Dolan's wife is a noted a remote viewer people were saying a noted remote viewer
7093960	7097560	No, it's was great aliens talking. I'm used to extract DMT
7097560	7102360	Okay, so I think somebody said that this experience was just the DMT talking and you are talking about
7102920	7104920	Um actual beans you observed
7105640	7111320	Favorite bjj move any follow and whose lineage do you follow prefer sport or self-defense?
7111640	7116280	Now that's a great question. I am from the hegan machado lineage under nobu yagai
7117560	7120280	I my favorite move. I like ripping twisters
7120440	7125080	I have been catching blue belts with twisters almost every day now and it brings me
7125800	7131800	Incredible joy to twister somebody you get the twister hook you either banana split them calf slice or them twister them or take the back
7131880	7133080	it's is
7133080	7135080	Just a very sublime experience
7135400	7140840	and I I would say sport because I also train mixed martial arts and uh judo
7141480	7144440	And I have done some competing in jujitsu. So
7145880	7153320	Self-defense is more the Gracie combatives and that I'm a large man. So I'm not a lot of people would probably try and uh
7153880	7158200	Frankenstein choke me in the street. So mostly sports for me mostly sports
7158600	7161560	I hope you can carry john max torch really hope you are real one
7161800	7166920	I hope so too, man. One of my biggest passions besides crash retrieval is to speak to witnesses
7166920	7168920	That's one of the biggest things. I know a lot of people
7169400	7173240	Kind of feel uncomfortable doing that but I will go out of my way to try and speak to witnesses
7173560	7176920	That involves cold calling and we saw how that went with witness tb
7177960	7179480	We saw how that went
7179480	7183400	Uh senior mechanical engineer for Cummins. Oh cool. My senior project in school was for Cummins
7183400	7188520	We went to the factory in indiana. We made a spark plug durability tester. The Cummins guys are really smart
7189080	7190520	very smart
7190520	7193560	I find the varginia case very compelling. I might relate it to other
7194280	7199080	Other cases and focus on more so the crash retrieval aspect because I know james fox already has a brilliant
7199640	7200840	excellent
7200840	7203000	piece on varginia in moment of contact
7204360	7208360	I think russia's talked about the ufo that is way bigger when entered in one of the leak conference
7208440	7213720	Yes, that was the wall street conference that occurred just after but the original article came out in I think june
7213720	7219000	But he re-referenced that at that wall street speech. He gave to like 60 people that somebody leaked out some photos. Yes
7219320	7225720	If you look up astral projections, some people report vaccine shadow people in that realm and sometimes they will hunt that sounds terrifying
7225800	7227800	That sounds extremely scary
7228680	7231800	Michael's story is extremely compelling. No doubt about that. I agree
7232840	7235720	I can probably put a good word for you in Cummins. I appreciate that
7235720	7240680	I I hope to I hope to be able to travel around full time for this someday speaking to um
7241400	7243640	speaking to uh witnesses and so forth
7244520	7247640	Opinions on reptilians same. I uh
7248440	7249640	Approach that with an open mind
7249640	7255240	I think there's probably a difference in the reptilians of david eich of the lizard people that are obama and hillary clinton
7255560	7259800	Versus a type of a reptilian-esque species. I know michael schratt has
7260440	7262440	Discussed this from the notes of lennard stringfield
7262600	7269080	But same thing if robert sarbacher and vanavar bush have commented on an insectoid almost mantis like bean. I gotta keep it open mind
7270360	7272920	Love the iceberg series. Okay. Here's what i'm thinking guys
7273800	7277240	With lives, of course, we talked about some news today and we've had more fun
7277320	7284360	What i'm thinking is if we do another iceberg we do it together in a live and we can um research as we go
7284680	7290360	I'd like to keep the channel focused on investigations crash retrievals discussing witnesses and interviews
7290760	7294280	If you guys like that and we'll find some time to do um
7294920	7297880	Some icebergs together. I think that'd be a heck of a lot of fun
7299400	7302120	Have you done any research on the horton brothers? I've never I have not
7302440	7304440	I have not and i'm gonna write that down
7305880	7307880	Thank you
7309000	7313160	Yes, j. Allen heineck was absolutely convinced there was something to uh do this
7313720	7317400	I love j. Allen heineck. He's very such an interesting person
7318760	7322600	I've always found the fact that there were like 50 different radar recordings of the object going like five times
7322680	7329000	Fast than anything humans had in the 60s to be very compelling. Yeah, including a verner von bran's mentor herman osberth
7329560	7334200	A rocket scientist talking about upper bounds of ufo speed flying saucer speed being like
7335000	7337000	30 to 48 thousand miles per hour
7337400	7339400	Hackology, what's up, man?
7339960	7344200	They're plasma powered. That's how they create clouds the clouds also camouflage. I have heard that as well
7344280	7347640	It's sort of like an mhd plasma. I have heard that as well
7348600	7349960	um
7349960	7356520	Some craft are invisible to the naked eye as they affect gravity. Yes, that is one of the five observables from uh lulizondo low observability
7356600	7362600	Could you please uh link to the paper you mentioned? Yeah, sure. Let me throw that in the chat. Uh
7365960	7367960	Sorry
7368760	7371240	That's so many flight characteristics of unidentified
7372600	7376040	Anomalous, all right. I've referenced this a few times from kevin canuth
7376760	7379880	But there it is in the chat if you would like to like to watch
7381480	7383480	Okay, um
7384280	7390520	By the way, I know the people that wrote the post on amy eskridge that blew up on reddit and they deleted it the next day
7390520	7393480	Do you know why they deleted it the next day? That's that is interesting
7394760	7397800	It would make sense if they utilize some gravity creating tech. Yeah, I'm
7398360	7402760	Even bob lasar has said that back in the day. Uh, maybe we'll cover him someday. Maybe
7404040	7411000	Let's see. Um, sorry. I'm just uh, the paulic interview was crazy the implications of them trying to implant people on a massive scale
7411400	7413400	And the tech what they can do it is the paulic
7414040	7419320	Interview is very very consequential. I would highly recommend watching that guys highly recommend
7420520	7424440	Um, the the grays live underground so that would be similar to phil schneider's claims
7426760	7431480	Uh, michael says no problem. Have a good night. I'm off to work in a little bit. Keep up the support and keep tuning into kerb's channel
7431480	7433480	Yeah, guys michael
7433480	7435480	works his tail off I
7435640	7440120	I've sometimes talked to him and it'll be like nine or ten at night and he's still at work
7440200	7442760	So michael is very hardworking
7443240	7447240	Will you start doing live streams going through ufo related info because I've seen some very interesting videos
7447320	7449560	Documents and links to share with you. Yeah, absolutely
7450120	7453480	Maybe what we could do just because I like I'm not the news of the day type guy
7453480	7457640	I don't really care for um, like reaction type content. Maybe I know I've talked about this
7457640	7460280	But I'll actually do it like once a week we can just kind of round up some
7460760	7464200	Some news of the day discuss stuff because just as much as I want to give my opinion
7464200	7468200	I want to hear your guys's opinion. You guys keep me grounded in my research as well
7468520	7474760	Of course, just investigating solo can do some crazy things to your mind. So I do really appreciate every single comment you guys have
7475480	7477000	nuclear power would merely
7477000	7482040	Uh cover the energy output of the objects luminosity beyond that it has to be a completely different power source. Yes
7484360	7486360	Uh, Richard Dolan's wife
7486440	7492120	Uh is a lot more into the woo side and does remote viewing. They are interesting pair and complement each other well probably keeps them more balanced
7492120	7494760	I agree. I agree Dolan. Dolan is fantastic
7495720	7499880	I bet Davis was never under NDA about that memo. They were just pretending for whatever reason. I think yeah
7500520	7504680	And I think it was also Edgar Mitchell now has it has been shown. He was under NDA
7505800	7507800	okay, um
7508680	7515240	That's exactly how real ets appear these days as orbs lights meteors like objects are just staying the other dimension because they are targeted with
7515240	7521000	Scalar weapons when appeared in 3d the subject of scalar weapons in golden domes of she hand puts them to kind of
7521720	7526200	Tech cloaked uap and bring them down is very interesting like I would definitely cover that
7527160	7528760	Definitely cover that
7528760	7533080	Uh, do you do these every sunday? No, but I should it's been difficult to find the time
7533160	7537000	But if sunday's a good time that works for everybody I would I would love to
7538200	7541880	Um, did your friends end up convincing you to try path of exile?
7542280	7544200	No, I haven't been able to play too many games
7544200	7546600	But what I have been playing is the black ops 6 beta
7546920	7551000	So if anybody wants to play some black ops 6 when it comes out, I know that's a very casual take
7551880	7555800	But reading so much. I need some games to just kind of melt my mind a little bit
7555800	7560280	So if people want to play black ops when it comes out, let's do it. Let's do it live iceberg
7560280	7565240	Okay, next week. We are doing a good, uh, a nice live iceberg. Okay guys, I'll find a fresh one
7565640	7567640	We'll go through it. We'll have some fun
7567720	7573400	Um, I get a coffee about the it was post-grouchy and they pulled it because concerned about family members and digging in a little too
7573960	7577800	Yeah, the the the digging too deep can definitely be a concern or
7578520	7581000	violating possibly violating any sort of ops sec
7581640	7583240	operational security
7583240	7587560	Is not fun. How do you find the time to go through all this do research and then do videos?
7588040	7589480	um
7589480	7591480	The research stage is
7591720	7596360	Um is like a is a true gift. I love doing research for stuff
7596920	7601240	Recording audio is another story and editing can be a slog
7601960	7606600	But doing the research time flies by I could sit for 10 hours a day pouring through documents
7606920	7608680	How do I find the time to do this?
7608680	7612680	Fortunately, I have a very nice girlfriend that understands that how much this means to me
7612760	7617480	Unfortunately, her dad is also huge into ufo. So she doesn't mind when I speak to to him about it
7617480	7620440	Or she doesn't mind when he speaks to me about it. But uh,
7621240	7625880	I'd say the biggest thing is efficiency and that's having a database of documents which I always try and have
7627640	7629640	Have you ever seen the custodian file? Yeah, I have
7630120	7634040	They've been recording u.p. He calls dragons. Yes, I have and that's that's interesting
7634440	7640120	Again, I don't place uh too much on footage. Uh, just because there's so much footage out there and you can debate endlessly
7640600	7643720	Uh, so I just kind of like to move on for
7644840	7646840	Move on a little bit from footage, uh
7647240	7652040	To me, maybe it's good to put in videos, but uh discussing it. It can just go around in circles
7652360	7657080	Palak. Yes, watch this on the dpr archive. It was lc who brought this up super interesting
7657400	7660600	He passed before the interview came out. This was in early 2000s
7661000	7666360	I believe at like a just a middle age too, which is tragic like 50 or 60. But yeah, um
7667400	7669560	So I I'd really recommend looking at palak
7669720	7675560	I'd also recommend that you check out the study that was going on by the uh, tedesco brothers and donna nardo on long island
7676040	7683000	Speaking of long island, that's a I can't wait to cover the 1992 long island ufo case near brookhaven national labs
7683560	7685560	So that's an interesting place
7685560	7687560	Who is my favorite ufo journalist?
7688120	7692200	Leonard stringfield and ryan wood easily easily. Those are the two best
7692840	7696280	magic eyes only and crash retrievals parts one through seven are
7697160	7699160	absolute works of art
7699640	7701640	absolute works of art
7702280	7710520	Oh, okay searching palak implants puts uh, no so the google the google uh dpr archive the link system doesn't work
7710760	7715080	So if you join in the the discord, I will let me I'll post one more link
7715160	7717960	I will post that uh, once I get off once I get through these
7718520	7720520	Comments, I will post that
7721880	7723880	So I'll put the palak video
7725160	7729560	Um, thank you man. God bless you too. I love answering the questions. It's a lot of fun
7729560	7732840	Okay, everybody likes. Hey, have a good labor day too. I don't know how to say your name
7732840	7735320	I will just call you attack on titan demon
7736120	7739480	But yeah sunday sunday is great. Everybody loves path of exile guys. Don't
7740120	7743640	Don't don't ruin my life. It's already tough enough to get to get videos out
7744200	7749080	Just a tip. It's european 3m. Maybe do it earlier for more views. Uh, good. Yeah, I thank you for that
7749160	7753640	I appreciate that. I know a couple people were saying they were in the uk and that it was a bit late
7754280	7758520	Mr. Harry, thank you very much guys. I'm gonna get through these and then we'll we'll call it a night my friends
7759960	7764200	Counter strike 1.6 my friend. Mr. T. W. Loves counter strike
7765400	7768280	Loves counter strike and he is trying to get me into it
7769320	7774120	The horton brothers were a part of nazi germany and project paperclip, but they were taken by the russians. Okay, that is interesting
7774200	7776680	I would like to I would like to research that
7777080	7783800	Uh, Leonard stringfield is unmatched. Yes. Leonard stringfield is his work is just beautiful. It is beautiful
7783880	7789240	I hope one day I can go to his archive and in Cincinnati my hometown and and look into there
7789960	7793480	It's list on the eoc channel too. Oh the paulic videos on eoc. Cool
7794440	7799640	The custodian file situation is basically the answer to all this the team at skinwalker ranch kept having dragons fly by in the
7799720	7803800	Intense gravitational field would drain their battery. I think I have heard that about uh, kind of
7805400	7807400	Draining their batteries. I think I have
7808520	7811400	Have you ever read corso's original manuscript for the day after ross?
7811400	7812120	Well, it's pretty dry
7812120	7816360	But it makes a lot more sense than the release book the publisher added a bunch of fluff to the book
7816440	7818040	I have that document downloaded
7818040	7824840	But I haven't actually read it because I didn't know there was a lot of fluff that was cut out
7825320	7830280	So is that his uh specific affidavit because I will read that that sounds awesome
7830760	7834040	Love from australia. Hey, thanks, man. As you can tell by the poster
7834360	7837160	I got a lot of respect for the Aussies a lot of respect
7838040	7840600	Almost someone with his eric mitchell overview would prefer to send
7841320	7845960	Via discord dm. I will keep an eye out for the request once we hang up and I'll get all that stuff going
7846360	7850600	And with that guys, I think tonight we will call it a night everybody who's been here
7850680	7854200	Whether it be five minutes or the whole time we've been on for two hours and 10 minutes
7854760	7859640	Thank you guys so much. Uh, it means the most seeing everybody commented. I love it
7859720	7863160	I don't know where I'd be without you guys. So we will plan for
7863720	7868040	Next sunday and right now we are in the research stage of a new video. I got like
7868920	7873080	I'd say five or six immediate videos coming out one of them
7873960	7876520	If I can get this individual to
7877160	7882280	Speak would be a huge video. Uh, actually two people actually three
7882680	7885880	There's three huge leads. I'm chasing down. I'm not going to spoil anything right now
7885880	7888600	But I really hope I can cover these because they'll be awesome videos
7889080	7894520	And with that guys everybody have a wonderful night and I will catch you all later. Goodbye my friends
7895720	7897720	and stream
