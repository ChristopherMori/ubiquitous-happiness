WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
What?

00:20.000 --> 00:38.000
All right. I think we're live. Let me see. Let's check on the phone.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
What up, Martin? How you doing, man? We are live. Awesome.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
What up, Brandon? How you doing, man? What are you guys up to?

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm going to wait for some people to filter in,

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
and then I kind of wanted to touch on some of the new interests around the Wilson Davis document and the fat rodents Chaco Martin.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
What's up? Hey, guys. So, yeah, we'll just wait for a couple people to filter in.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
We'll talk about the new Wilson Davis revelations because I also really want to touch on what Eric Davis said.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
And I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of that. And then the Ross Colt Hart AMA. I found it pretty interesting.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, I kind of want to review two possible sources of that 2004 JSOC on program action.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
What's up, Bertie? I don't know if I've seen you in lives before. So what's going on?

01:26.000 --> 01:36.000
While we're gearing up, I do want to talk about if everybody can just keep Mr. Ryan Wood in their minds.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
As you guys probably learned about two days ago, Dr. Robert Wood has passed on.

01:42.000 --> 01:53.000
I know recently he suffered some sort of medical complications, and I know talking with Ryan, I think his father's passing came as somewhat of a surprise.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
So if you can keep him in your mind, and if you guys can let me know if you've watched Dr. Robert Wood's video on the DPI,

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
but in Stephen Greer's 2001 kind of video set, you can find it on SiriusDisclosure.com.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
I highly recommend watching that as kind of Ryan touched on the video as a McDonnell Douglas aircraft rocket scientist.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Actually, this man was incredibly accomplished. He kind of talked to his superiors.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
When are we going to figure out gravity manipulation technology before Lockheed Martin does?

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
And he was given a task, met up with Stanton Friedman, but was basically denied access.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
So he was a big friend of Stanton Friedman. Let's go through some of these questions and so forth.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Bertie, yes, almost 10k. Hope so soon, man. That'd be awesome. I can't believe this. I started this channel out.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Maybe we'll talk about the origins of the channel a little bit. This is actually quite funny. Let me go through this.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Will O'Malley retain? Yes, he's going to knock Marabba out in the early rounds.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And then if Taporio beats, I don't even want to hear it. This man still should be champ.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
If Taporio beats Holloway, which I don't think he will, I'd like to see O'Malley knock out Taporio.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
What's up, Quitter? Bertie? Yes, sir. Hey, and Cody, thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
But what's the most compelling evidence? Yeah, let's talk about that too.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
Real fast about Mr. Robert Wood. Ryan, actually, when he and I met, because before we did our video online,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
he and I actually had met up in person because he lives quite close to me in Colorado.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I shared a coffee talk for like three and a half hours. I'm so gracious for his time.

03:31.000 --> 03:40.000
He has a lot of interest in kind of the gravity manipulation research that Ross Colthart has talked about stemming from the 50s and so on.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So I hope to have Ryan back on about that sort of project.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
There's a really good article, and I believe the drive about the 50s gravity manipulation studies.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
So I'll also link that. But what's the most compelling piece of evidence the MJ12 docs are real?

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
I might say the surrounding the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman Forest Hall memo, the Cutler Twining memo,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
and Nathan Twining's White Hot Report. I think those are very interesting.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
There's so much good information around the Eisenhower briefing document.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
I want to return to the Majestic 12 as well soon. I know you guys are familiar with Grant Cameron.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
We'll talk about him in a little bit as we discuss the Wilson Davis memo.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
In his files with UFO researcher Bill Moore, I've actually found some new Majestic documents I've never seen before, dated to the 80s.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
So maybe in a little bit when I share my screen and we go through some stuff, we'll throw that up too, because this specific Majestic documents talks about EBEs.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
So, you know, I don't know if you guys back earlier this year, Grant Cameron released his files.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
I highly recommend going through those. Maybe I can link them, including a big file set on the current project I'm working at, hoping to get out this week.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
We do have the, you know what, now that you mentioned that, of course we have Ben Rich, but now we have Dr. Jim Ryder, as mentioned in imminent, and Lou Elizondo.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
So Dr. Jim Ryder, I've actually been kind of looking into him a little bit behind the scenes with a couple of my friends.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
He was in the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center or Division, ATC Advanced Technology Center.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
On Lockheed's media stories, there are only ever two, there have only ever been two documents surrounding Dr. Jim Ryder.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
One of which was, one of which was a press release on some carbon nanotube material.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
And another one was on, another one was on, sorry, I'm trying to remember.

05:30.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center and a deal with DARPA to make a more substantial satellite network.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
I've been here, I know, Brady, you've been here since day one, man. I remember the first video I ever put out had the Wilson Davis video.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
We had like, I remember I was counting up the views on that every time I'd see one of the extra view and I'd get so happy.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
I am so sick of all these guys with the shady behind the scenes stories we need to hear and subpoena all these characters like Davis and put off, make them testify.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So all these rumors once and for all, I agree with that in terms of Eric Davis.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
He seems to be very selective when he likes to weigh in about the phenomenon and so forth.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
Eric Davis will stay quiet for a very extended period of time and then just come online to say that Lou Elizondo is fooey and something like that.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
I'd like to hear more about him and as we'll talk about in a little bit, it's interesting to hear him comment on the Wilson Davis memo.

06:21.000 --> 06:30.000
You know, even in his comment, there's some stuff that, you know, at least talking to James Rigney, the man who kind of brought the memo to Grant Cameron is a little inaccurate.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
So I would like to see Eric Davis subpoenaed.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Jimmy Shoe, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I really appreciate that.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
How do you think the Lockheed team killed the JSEC guys training or exotic equipment?

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, we will dive into that in just a little bit because as you know, I think a lot of this is getting connected with John Stewart and his supposed 2023.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
I think it was December 2023, but I have the files up. We'll go through it on the screen.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
We'll actually go through the whole exchange that John Stewart posted.

06:57.000 --> 07:08.000
But remember, remember this, remember Michael Herrera's insider submitted a document that was supposed to be a play on Dobser similar to secret machines by Tom DeLonge.

07:08.000 --> 07:20.000
This manuscript called Sentinels of Ether covers a blue on blue black program team killing JSEC members in 2004 in none other than Koyame, Mexico with conventional weaponry.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
So we'll talk about that.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
So there was an experimental in the submarine in the fifties or sixties that used magnetic fields to operate and wasn't a classified project.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
I haven't heard of that T hammer. If you have a link, I would really, really like to go into that.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
You like that, pal? I know you like that.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
My lady got that for me. It's signed by Volk and everything. So that was a true treat to get and this is going to be the centerpiece.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
I have a couple of other things to hang up. I got a Joey made me a custom printed logo. I need to get that up and have another Bob reactor drawing.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
And of course, I have the framed Michael drawing. I got to get up Michael Herrera's when he drew the ARV.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So I need to get get that up.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Will you ever do a video? Yeah, absolutely. I read the 4chan whistleblower a lot.

08:07.000 --> 08:21.000
Any of you guys who aren't familiar with that, the crux of his argument or testimony is that deep underwater, there is a basically purpose built UAP production craft hamburger shaped.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I believe it is. It's enormous.

08:23.000 --> 08:34.000
And apparently this builds UAP to spec and part of the reason that UAP is crash, according to this man's testimony is this this custom specking machine doesn't really care what happens to the to the craft.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
So yeah, I actually really want to go through that line by line by line because there's so much interesting stuff there.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
Everything from talking about orbs and how he says the underlying structure behind these orbs people see is almost like a like a hammer shape, right?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
If you if you've read that to the underground basis, he touches on implants.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
And of course, implants are kind of the big ticket item now with Lou commenting on them.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Then speaking of Lou, what are you guys thinking of imminent?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
I still haven't read it yet, if I'm being honest, I got a lot of other projects I'm working on.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I do hope to talk to Lou soon.

09:05.000 --> 09:15.000
So if that's the case, you guys, my community, let's bump heads and let's figure out how to talk to him different than all of these from his Joe Rogan appearance to his all of his other appearances just talking about imminent

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and kind of the atyp all that stuff.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I would like to dig into the origins of that a little bit more if I talked to him.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
And I would also like to talk more about crash retrievals and so forth.

09:23.000 --> 09:32.000
Of course, in imminent, he talks about the December 6, I mean, December 1950 crash retrieval near El Indio Guerrera near Del Rio, Texas.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Those of you will know that that is only mentioned in the Eisenhower briefing document.

09:36.000 --> 09:44.000
So that could be a huge validating piece of the majestic documents to find out a little bit more about that case.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
So signed by Volk. Yes, it is. And bought by your lady. Yes, it is.

09:50.000 --> 10:01.000
We are a Volkanovsky household. She knows that whenever it's time for Volk to fight that I'll need complete silence because if he loses, which he hasn't because anytime he's lost, it's been CGI.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I'll have a mental breakdown.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
So Snapple, how did you, how did I not find your channel before?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Insanely, I appreciate that. I really appreciate that.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
We're still early, man. We're still just starting up.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
I think first video was in mid to late January and that was on the Wilson Davis memo, which is very timely.

10:17.000 --> 10:27.000
If you've watched that video, I think I was extremely ill when I made it, had a nasty cold and was working on a like $10 Amazon mic.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
So it sounds horrendous. I don't think there's any music or real production value.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't think I showed my face in that.

10:33.000 --> 10:45.000
So, you know, maybe at a year, we'll revisit that topic and get a, get a bigger type of analysis on the Wilson Davis need to dive more into Lou's relationship with Bigelow.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
Yes. And Bigelow's plan to receive materials given from Lockheed Martin as highlighted in Kona Blue.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
So I think that's a great one. If any of you guys have questions, so I'm not saying anything set in stone, but if I get to talk to Lou, if you guys have questions that

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
branch out a little bit from his regular media appearances, let me know and I'll kind of factor that in.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Again, if you weren't here yet, I do plan to talk more about crash retrievals.

11:11.000 --> 11:21.000
I sent you a Gmail. Are you possibly, I'm super behind on my emails. I'm sorry, guys. I have so many to go through and I try to respond to each one very thoughtfully.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
So if I haven't read your email yet, I promise I'm getting through the list. I'm so sorry.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
I know a lot of other productions have like a team or moderators. It's just me on this and that's kind of how I liked it.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I want to make sure I interface and speak to everybody here what they have to say. So if I'm behind, I'm very sorry, guys.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
Big dog. Hey, Lou, did MJ12? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to ask him straight up.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
I know Lou likes to answer questions he can't talk about in a bit of a roundabout way.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
I don't really kind of confirm or deny anything or even give the classic intelligence line like I can't comment on that.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
So I would like to figure some good ways to structure subjects such as that.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
A Volk poster. Your girl have a sister.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Spectre you the man. Thank you very much.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Volk should have been double champ. Pride rules.

12:13.000 --> 12:22.000
Don't get me started on that. Let's see the difference between Volk and Islam in the fifth round and the second fight with CGI.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Is there any known case of a UAP crash in 2004? I know that I know there is the Tic Tac case, but that's not a crash.

12:28.000 --> 12:38.000
That is a good question. And like we'll talk about we have two origins and two kind of stories surrounding the 2004 JSOC team.

12:38.000 --> 12:49.000
In John Stewart's source, they talk about a crash retrieval in the Sentinels of Ether story. It talks about trafficking humans.

12:49.000 --> 13:00.000
So I'm not quite sure. But I again, I'd like to pay attention to the Sentinels of Ether because remember that location in which this event takes place.

13:00.000 --> 13:13.000
Kuyama, Mexico. And we have covered a case with a story of a team that a Mexican national military team that died trying to transport the vehicle.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
It does. I hope I've answered. Yes, I have answered your priority. I'm very sorry if I'm slow on them.

13:19.000 --> 13:28.000
So Pina Davis put off Elizondo Sheehan, Nell Mellon. I think Nell is one of the most interesting people to talk to about this topic.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
I have myself, I've spoken to Chris Mellon a few times. I tried to invite him on for an interview. He had to decline for the moment.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Hopefully we can get that in the future. I would really like to hear more from Chris Mellon.

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
So do you have any comment on Hans Kamler? He was in charge of the Nazi secret weapon and only was recently revealed, was taken into custody after US custody.

13:47.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah, where did, hold on, where did I hear that? I was talking to somebody. Yes, I was talking to somebody about this in terms of.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah, I was talking to a friend about this, that there are some documents stating that Kamler was actually alive.

14:03.000 --> 14:15.000
I think this relates to a supposed Nazi base that was explored post-World War II near the Czech Republic that was revisited about 40 years later.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
I have to check my notes on that, but that is ringing a bell.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Andrea, I love your videos. I've got my mom on to them. Thank you. I hope your mom enjoys them.

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
Structure question. Lou, if someone kept D, I don't know, any alleged recoveries during his tenure with ATIP?

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
Yes, that's actually a great question. The only one I can really think of is the 2008 Needles, California crash.

14:38.000 --> 14:47.000
And that would of course be right at the time he has joined ATIP. That is a case that was covered by George Knapp.

14:47.000 --> 14:57.000
I would like to cover that in the future. There's not a ton around that case, but I know George Knapp in his reporting commented on some really interesting kind of military presence around that time.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Again, if you haven't heard of that case, it's Needles, California 2008, and I will cover that.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Toby Milo, thank you so much. Would love to see a collab with you and Lou or you and Ross.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
Love to see Michael back. Tim Gallaudet likes your stuff. Have him on. Ross is still that dude. I'll tell you that much.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
I've reached out to Timothy Gallaudet. He is not doing interviews at the moment, maybe in the future. I'd like to have Lou on.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
I'd love to talk to Ross. And with Michael, I'm still investigating his case.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
So if there's new stuff to cover, of course, I'd love to talk to Michael again.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
Mrs. Floyd, thank you so much. I really appreciate that.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
And if young Hannah is watching, tell her I say hi.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
MJ12, reworded question. If someone wants to keep digging on MJ12, would they eventually hit pay dirt one way or another?

15:46.000 --> 15:54.000
Good way to put it. I like that. I like that. All right. Peps per-speak cautious.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I can't. You guys know I can't speak.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.000
Did you hear anything from the insider who manages multiple use up facilities about using PLFs and psychotronics to fake alien abductions and blame them on ETs?

16:04.000 --> 16:13.000
No, no, I did not. But however, referencing the Stephen Greer DPI archive, there is witness.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Let's see if I can get this out of my head. 10892.

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
10892 that talks about being on a retrieval team at Nellis observing a sunflower shaped NHI craft that had landed

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
and also fake PLF. If you guys don't know what a PLF is, that's a programmable life form.

16:28.000 --> 16:40.000
This person in the DPI archive number 10892 alleges that after his time on a retrieval team, he encountered a programmable life form in a fake abduction.

16:40.000 --> 16:49.000
I have all of those files downloaded because we know Stephen Greer in OPSEC, so I don't know if those operational security, I don't know if those files are going to be taken down.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
But so I would like to dive into that case and give it its due diligence.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
The documents came out in 2021 that show Hans Kemler was taken into custody.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
The OSS agent who took him into US custody said to his son, Kemler had knowledge of weapons that influenced the Cold War in future.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Yes, and that was the correct me if I'm wrong.

17:05.000 --> 17:15.000
And if you're on this subject, that was the location in the Czech Republic where the Nazis supposedly stored some art precious cardio and possibly weaponry.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Well, I do a video on the UAP DA closer to December.

17:19.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, I probably should at this point seen as I reference it almost every video, especially the line about legacy programs, the 1954 Atomic Energy Act and classifying UAP materials as trans classified for nuclear materials.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
So I would like to do that.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Is the control group headed from NATO outside US?

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
That's a good question. There is a lot of there's a lot of interesting

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
roots to go down to say that the control group handling the UAP issue issue isn't necessarily tied to one nation.

17:51.000 --> 18:06.000
If you remember back to 2023, we have Canadian politician Larry McGuire, who wrote to the Canadian Defense Minister requesting to sort of start to divulge UAP information due to the collaboration effort between five eyes nation on the UAP issue.

18:06.000 --> 18:18.000
So we at least know outside of NATO, there's sort of a five eyes effort to study UAP, whether the program, whether that means the program, it extends to all five nations or primarily operated on the United States for quasi national.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm not quite sure, but that's a great, great question.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Did you see Eric Davis admitted on Facebook? Yeah, we're about to talk about that.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Mr. Ben, I cannot wait.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
That's very, very excited.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
The Wilson Davis memo was my first ever video, so I'm happy to revisit it.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Who blazing? I don't know, man, I wouldn't be able to speak if I was blazing.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Max Parr, thank you so much.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
You're one of the best researchers out there.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
So happy you spend hours you do dedicated to this.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
What's your opinion on and you are own national underwater reconnaissance office BTW.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
So thank you, Max.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I really appreciate it.

18:52.000 --> 19:04.000
The kind of USO underwater naval aspect of the phenomenon is something I am going down deep rabbit holes to research.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
If you watch my off world technologies division, I have studied a specific naval center.

19:10.000 --> 19:21.000
I don't really want to talk about and other naval centers that put to mind that sort of the Navy has a massive vested interest in UAP technology exploitation program.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Or the study of USO.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
Earlier in my research, I would solely really only focus on the Air Force and mostly Air Force projects.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Of course, the Air Force paper trail and UAP is so simple to find.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
You can just go back to the 50s and look at USAF regulation 200-2.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
You can look at any sort of USAF response to any sort of UAP discussion.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
But I'm really starting to take a harder look at the Navy.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
So with the Navy comes analysis of any sort of underwater reconnaissance office.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Any sort of alleged underwater bases as well.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I was actually talking to Ryan Wood about this.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
In his research, he has come across two really interesting spots underwater.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
One off the coast of Florida and one off of Catalina Island in California.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
So as we move further with this channel, I know I've done the two USO videos.

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
I really want to dive into more about kind of the Navy and any sort of underwater effort in relation to the phenomenon and USO in particular.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
What do you think of the Phil Schneider story?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
I haven't.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
And thanks again, Max Parr.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I really appreciate that.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Guys, Max Parr is a good friend of mine.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I really appreciate everything he does.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
He's a great dude.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
What do you think about the Phil Schneider story?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I haven't paid.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I haven't done it.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
It's due diligence.

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
What I do know is that Phil Schneider claimed to have experienced a firefight in underground tunnels with NHI.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
And I think fellow soldiers he was with were turned into some sort of goop or just faced horrific weaponry.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And I know he also had a very mysterious death.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Now, that is the extent I know a Phil Schneider.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
I would like to look at him someday, you know, maybe he'd be a candidate for a UFO whistler's blur video.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
I'm not sure yet.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
I always admit when I don't know something that right now my knowledge on Phil Schneider is not great.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Interview with Danny Sheehan might be fruitful.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
I would love that.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
I don't know if I could talk my friend Jesse Michaels though.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
He put out that interview with Sheehan and that's the best.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Now, there is a good chance that very soon Mr. Michaels and I will be together.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
So I'd love to maybe just have a discussion with him.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Maybe record it.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
And maybe we could talk to Jesse about his experience with Sheehan.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
So I think that'd be great.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
What does Brady say?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Anyone who has checked out the old interviews on Greer's channel, it's really missing out.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I 100% agree.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Anybody who's listening right now, please go to...

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
No, I got the website wrong earlier.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Go to DrStevenGreer.com.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Up in the banner there's a link to witness testimony.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
There you can find everything from Philip Corso to Robert Wood to...

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I think you can even find like Carl Wolfe there and so forth.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
You can find a ton of interesting interviews.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Programmed life forms.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
They are clones using real ET DNA from down to UFOs.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
They clone the beans and put some advanced tech in their brains to control them.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That is an avenue I'd really like to explore.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
If you have some documents or just kind of research avenues on PLFs, please send them to me.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
UAPGrever.com.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I'll be better about the emails.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I'd really like to learn more, especially as I look into witness 10.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
10, 8, 9, 2.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
And again, if you want to look at a witness who spoke to Greer about PLFs, 10, 8, 9, 2.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Jim Shoe, I love you too.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I just got done with a skinny bob, an alien deep dive.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Do you believe either of those are legitimate?

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
I have not done the due diligence into either video.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I know that the alien interview is kind of Jon Stewart's jam.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I'll let him do his thing.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I got to...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I think he's got an interview coming out in December.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
So I'll reserve judgment for then.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
The skinny bob, I know that's floated around.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I know it's such a contentious thing, but correct me if I'm wrong.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
I think some people are inferring that Ross Colthart alluded to skinny bob being a...

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
maybe skinny bob or other footage in the public domain being legitimate.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So correct me if I'm wrong.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
Hans Kamler must have had knowledge about the Magenta 1933 and maybe Germans moved it to Skoda Works.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Okay, yeah, and this might be Skoda Works I'm thinking of.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
Speaking of the 1933 crash, I know two guys that are excellent and have so much knowledge on the 33.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
So if you guys want to see a revisit of that, this guy has so many connections to Alan Dolos and so forth.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I'd love to revisit that.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Do you think Eric Davis would testify?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
I don't know.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Maybe he has behind closed doors, but I really don't know.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I really don't know.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Okay, let's see.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Let's see.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
The Wilson Davis is huge confirmation of the fact that Steven Greer...

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Yes, thank you.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I know people have been talking about that lately.

23:47.000 --> 23:55.000
This is a confirmation that Steven Greer in 1997 did brief Admiral Thomas Wilson,

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
a deputy director of the DIA and other politicians on what we can assume is the disclosure briefing document from 2001.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
If you guys haven't read that, I'll flash it on screen in just a minute and we can talk about that as well.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
It's been said that every deep water deployment that has a nuclear payload has some type of UAP encounter,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
every single deployment.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
That brings to mind Lou speaking recently of the...

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
What was it?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Hawk missile?

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
No, I can't remember what type of missile, but in a retrieval recovery to find the cassette for the missile telemetry data,

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
a massive UAP rising from the surface and essentially taking the missile.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
So that's interesting.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
You know what case that stuck with me when I covered USO?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
It was the case of the...

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
I think it was a Tic-Tac in 1950 recorded in Blue Book.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
That was like a Tic-Tac or Ovoid shape.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I don't think quite Tic-Tac.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
That was just hovering above the surface almost turning the water.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
That was almost like vibrating very fast.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
For some reason, that particular USO case has really stuck in my head.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Phil Schneider was very sketchy.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
His death was very sketchy.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
We got to look into that, guys.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
I think one time I want to make a video just talking about suspicious deaths of UAP adjacent individuals,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
whether that be researchers or whistleblowers.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
What comes to mind is James E. McDonald as a primary person I want to talk about.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Two cents.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Thank you very much.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Criminally underserved curves, one of the few genuine nuts and bolts reporters out there.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I really appreciate that.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
Super thanks from Miss Hannah Floyd.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Thank you very much.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
For those who don't know, this is my lovely girlfriend, C.H.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
When is the program coming out?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Hopefully soon.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I know Jesse Michaels has actually watched the program.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I think that Robert Hastings has as well.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Robert Hastings wrote UFOs and nukes.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Hopefully soon.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
I know James Fox has just had another kind of investor on the program.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I am beside myself excited to see that.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I really want to watch.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
All right, Max Barr.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Isn't it fascinating?

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I wonder what underwater assets we're going to be considered for ATIPS Project Interloper.

26:01.000 --> 26:10.000
Yes, for anybody who doesn't know, Project Interloper is Lou referring to kind of entraping UAP with kind of large nuclear signatures.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
October, November, according to UFO Twitter.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Okay, let's see.

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
P. Is this hobby just our way of making the world more exciting after decades of this and an entire planet that could present evidence?

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
There is still nothing but stories and debunked videos.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
No, I do disagree with that.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
At this point, at least to me in my research, I don't really factor videos and I know I've covered two videos in the past, but I'm moving away from that.

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
I think that endless debate is going to circulate around videos.

26:40.000 --> 26:58.000
But I do think even the conversation is expanding so much with Lou Azzando, David Grush, but there is a massive, massive, massive, provable trail of a UFO cover-up, an interest in UFO from USG and other military sources from at least the 1930s for factoring in Magenta.

26:59.000 --> 27:10.000
The difficulty here and why we're stuck with so many stories is disinformation around this subject has been so complete and successful, it is so difficult to unwind this entire topic.

27:10.000 --> 27:20.000
This brings to mind stuff like OPNAV 3820 Air Force Regulation 200-2, which would restrict UFO reporting to certain channels to skirt the balance of Blue Book.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
This brings to mind J.L. and Heineck in Blue Book, which would discuss away UAP cases as nothing more than swamp gas or weather balloons.

27:27.000 --> 27:39.000
The famous case there, of course, is the 1955 case where many people in Michigan saw craft that J.L. and Heineck famously said was swamp gas that even at the time Senator Gerald Ford took an interest in.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
And all of this extends even towards the modern day with Arrow, right?

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
We have the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1, which demonstrably lies about some of the witnesses there.

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
For example, Michael Herrera, it discusses Michael Herrera seeing an extraterrestrial craft in American block ops team.

27:55.000 --> 28:04.000
So even today in 2024, there are official lies by USG elements about the phenomenon and about this topic.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
So there is a map and let's not forget the Robertson panel, the Condon Report.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Remember in the Condon Report by Edward Condon out of CU Boulder, which states there's nothing to UFOs, there's nothing there.

28:15.000 --> 28:25.000
There are multiple cases in there such as a 1955 case from an RB-47 jet, which multiple jets in formation saw, I think, a disc shaped UFO.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
It was caught on visual and radar and so forth performing insane maneuvers.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
And the Condon Report takes a sighting such as this as whatever, it's nothing.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
So there's a very provable cover up here for 80 years.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
What it is, this is what this is our purpose here.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And we can even look at Roswell.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Remember Roswell case closed the US Air Force debunk on Roswell.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
It didn't show up until 1994.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Roswell occurred in 1947.

28:53.000 --> 29:03.000
In that 1994, the US Air Force labeled the Roswell Weather Balloon Project Mogul Flight 4, which was then proven to not have even taken off on the day it was said to have taken off.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
And I think Roswell explained the bodies away as dummies, which weren't introduced into official USAF service into the 50s.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
So there's so much sketchiness around this topic.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
I could ramble on forever, forever.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Big dog, miss talking with you and Max, get back in.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Let's chat with Max.

29:20.000 --> 29:29.000
So what do you think about Eric Mitchell, who Dr. Michael Masters had a very intensive, I don't think I might not be familiar with Eric Mitchell.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Please enlighten me.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Pete's best.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Thank you very much.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
UFOs and NATO Richard Hall interview was first hand witnesses of finance and your team.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Have you seen it many leads?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
When is the Marshaise video dropping?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I have not seen that Richard Hall video, but I'm going to right now.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Full transparency.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I got two projects I'm working on right now.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
One of them is the good old Kecksburg 1965 crash retrieval case, which is a fantastic case.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
I can wait to talk about it.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
I'm trying some fresh research avenues on that case.

30:00.000 --> 30:07.000
Some things that haven't really been explored too much that have been in other kind of researchers files.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Okay.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Trollmama, what can we do to support you?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Just further the UAP discussion.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
That's it.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Continue to talk about UAP.

30:17.000 --> 30:25.000
Inform your friends who think that this is just a conspiracy and lump in the UAP phenomenon with Bigfoot, ghosts, ghouls, guests, demons.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Explain.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Explain the facts behind UAP.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
That's kind of why I started this channel.

30:32.000 --> 30:42.000
Talking about everything from Robertson panel to the creation of Blue Book sign grudge, the players in the 40s and 50s and so forth, early signings, Blue Book signings, USO signings and so forth.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Take a couple of hours to answer.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah, that's a good idea.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I'll do that this week.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Absolutely.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
When I interview Dr. Stephen Greer, I absolutely would interview Dr. Stephen Greer.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
That would be very controversial, but that is somebody who I would like to speak to.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Absolutely.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Again, we have our opinions.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Everybody has their opinion on Dr. Stephen Greer.

31:01.000 --> 31:07.000
I still will not downplay some of his previous efforts in the world of UAP.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Absolutely.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Big dog, thank you so much.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I really appreciate it.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Let me get through these and then let's touch on the Wilson Davis memo.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Correct.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Was that UFO and ET UFO or man made ARB?

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
If you're talking about the Michael Herrera in the Aero Historical Report Volume 1, from

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
time number one, he thought that was a man made vehicle.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
James Forestall getting thrown off the building.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Yep.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
I think Ryan would have some good stuff to speak about too on that.

31:32.000 --> 31:39.000
Of course, Dr. Mack as well died in a, I think like a really sudden drunk driving accident.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
Dolan, I think Dolan has a book coming out about USOs and I would really like to talk

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
to him about that too.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Dolan's just fantastic.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Dolan's one of the best of the best guys.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I really look up to him.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
What have I missed?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Nothing yet.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
We're just answering questions right now.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Everyone's asking great questions though.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
That's why we get through this.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Can you ask Lou about the tripping photos?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Yeah.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Actually, that's great.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Absolutely.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
What's up, David?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Have I?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
No, I have not.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
I think the people I want to talk to right away, just researchers, Grant Cameron, Richard

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Dolan and a huge one, Michael Schrat.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'd love to talk to these guys.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
There's plenty of other researchers I'm in contact with, but I'd love to sit down and

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
have a conversation with them.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
So because Libby, I was kind of baiting a Facebook post the other day about UAP USO and the only

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
people to respond like it besides Rando 30s was my active Navy friend from high school.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Interesting.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
It seems on Reddit and other platforms we're starting to get a lot of Navy personnel talking

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
about sightings.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
I think there was on Reddit about a Navy cook the other day who talked about his USO sightings.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
I can't really remember it.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
I only glossed over it, but he saw something rising out of the water.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
What do I think about the Nazca mummies?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
The Nazca mummies are very interesting.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I will be interested to see further research on them.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I know there's a website.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
I can't remember what it's called, but you can actually view the 3D scans of the mummies,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
including the one that supposedly has a fetus inside.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
I know there was some claims that a lot of these mummies were like a goat head or something

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
or animal parts stitched together, but I think there's been some research to kind of downplay

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
that.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Again, I'll need to get a better understanding, so I'll continue.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
I saw a video about a PhD building a nuclear honeypot to draw in UAP.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Yep, Mr. Interloper.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Okay.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
Please send your thoughts and prayers to UFO researcher Nicole Sackatch and Courtney.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
I know I've actually spoken to Courtney.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
Courtney is wonderful, and I have heard that she has faced intimidation and threats for

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
some of the stuff she's done.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So yeah, I have heard of that.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
So yes, keep her in your thoughts.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Then thank you so much.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
I appreciate that.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
That means the most to me.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
I really, really, really appreciate that.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Mr. Harry, cute dog.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
What do you think about the Greer files?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
What do you do with the Greer files?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Like or not, you went for the date.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
The Greer files are not done.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
There's a lot.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
Actually, there's a lot more I'm going to cover from the Greer files.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Everybody knows UFOs are real.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
That's not the debate now.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Who's piloting them?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Yes, I agree.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Who's piloting them and who has them?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
I'll write directly, Dr. Eric.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Okay.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I'm writing down Eric Mitchell, sir.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Thank you.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Let's see.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Which is a question that has been answered decades ago by Greer and other people like

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
Ben Rich confirmed that UFOs are of two types, ET and manmade UFOs or alien reproduction

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
vehicles.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
I have started to move forward tremendously in my outlook towards the possibility of ARVs

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
and manmade vehicles derived from extraterrestrial tech or just non-human tech in general.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
I am starting to really agree with that picture.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Sorry.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Let me get through these.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
David, Dr. Banevard Bush, the little I've read on him shows no science-fontological shock.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
He seemed to have pushed out of government work by 1950.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
If he was the head of MJ-12, it wasn't for long.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, quite possibly, but remember from the Bowen manuscript, this was in 1962.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
That was sent to the DOD for review from author Bowen.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
That was returned in 1962 with handwritten notes from Banevard.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
He was still fluttering around there.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Mark Streik.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
People still can't decide whether NHIs are ET-dimensional.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah, I agree.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
It's very divided.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
Of course, that's probably a conversation that's going to continue to tumble around for a long

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
time.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm talking about everyone.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Is it ET or ARVs?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Yes.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
We can start to build a database of flight characteristics and craft.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
Maybe we can find a demonstrable difference in kind of acceleration mechanisms, sound

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
output of craft, and so forth.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Zach, what's up, dude?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I've ever listened to Ray Bosch.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
He's a pastor who the Collins Elite talked to.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
No, I haven't.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I was talking about the Collins Elite with somebody today.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm absolutely going to chase that down.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
For anybody who doesn't know what the Collins Elite is, this was referenced by kind of Lou

35:54.000 --> 36:01.000
Elizondo and some of that other crew who talk about some people within the USG who are basically

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
terrified to investigate this phenomenon because they think it's demonic.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
I'd love to kind of really understand the thought process there.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I'd really like to go down that rabbit hole.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Shrat is a hero.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
He knows about the man-made UFOs.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Shrat is excellent.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
If you guys don't know Michael Shrat, he's a CAD designer.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
He's worked with so many witnesses to kind of recreate images of their encounters.

36:23.000 --> 36:31.000
And he has covered a lot of cases that deal with UAP that I've sometimes even utilized a human pilot.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Jangi Squint.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Oh, dude, your profile picture is nasty.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
But thank you very much.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I really appreciate that.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
The Ivan 0135 videos.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I think this is skinny Bob, right?

36:42.000 --> 36:49.000
I was asking if anybody can tell me with kind of further confidence if this was...

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Ross Colthart was alluding to this video.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Who is this Dolan guy?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Richard Dolan.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Please go to his channel and look at some of his books.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
He's fantastic.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Richard Dolan is one of the best UFO researchers out there.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Do you know when the program Insiders Book Sentinels of Ether will be published in full?

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
I do not, but I have asked the same questions because I would like to read more.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
Have I looked further into Draper, Gaither, and Anderson and their connections to the SAGE program, MIT Rad Lab?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Max Barr?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
No, I haven't.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
And I know when Max Barr drops a line of inquiry, guys, you listen.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
So no, I'm writing that down, man.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I really appreciate that.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I actually have no idea.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
So that's fantastic.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I appreciate that.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Radle, holy crap.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Thank you, Radle.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Thank you so much.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
I really appreciate that, especially the Volk poster looking out.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
That's incredible.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Thank you so much.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Thank you.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
It's the best.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
What do you make of Lou Elizondo's claims regarding excision of a technological device and implant from a U.S.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
servicemen who experienced a UAP event?

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
I think that the implant has been a territory I have been a little afraid to go down.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
Of course, there's just that and what's it called?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Abductions or they can just be so hairy.

38:04.000 --> 38:16.000
What I need to do here is now return to the sort of Dr. Lear and his kind of extensive work on supposed implant removal.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
So once I kind of looked on that, I'll have a way better kind of understanding of this.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
But I found it fascinating Lou would talk about that with Ross, especially the implant.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
You are really cool and doesn't afraid of anything.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Thank you, Peter.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
I appreciate that.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
I'm afraid of a lot.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
Black Ops guys showed up at my house and threatened me not to talk about this again.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I'd be pretty dang scared.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
But thank you.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
YouTube.com slash Richard M. Dolan.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I highly recommend checking him out.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Would you recommend interview Nick Redfern?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, absolutely.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Nick Redfern is always really interesting.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
If you guys listen to the podcast Mysterious Universe, he is always referenced on there too.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
So absolutely.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Yep.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
Dr. Lear has some awesome work on implants and that is going to be the next source.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Okay.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
Shall we discuss the kind of Wilson Davis stuff now?

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
Let me figure out how to share my screen guys.

39:10.000 --> 39:18.000
Present share screen share screen.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Let me window entire screens.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
I've never done this before guys.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
I'm still a bit of a novice share.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Okay.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
So here we have from the other day.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
This was from a private Facebook group that Eric Davis is in.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
And I believe since then, of course, I haven't been able to confirm this.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
But I think since then he has left this Facebook group because as far as I know,

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
this was supposed to be a private endeavor that was leaked.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
But Eric Davis, if you don't know, let's start with an introduction to the Wilson Davis memo.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
How about that?

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
Because I know anybody watching this channel probably knows what the Wilson Davis memo is.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Let me just pull up the file.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
We'll just do like a quick 15 second, probably like two minutes actually.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
We'll just go through the memo real fast.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
The Wilson Davis, sorry, I have so many files.

40:10.000 --> 40:18.000
Wilson Davis, Eric Davis meeting with Admiral Wilson.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Okay.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Good.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
So the Wilson Davis meeting recounts a meeting with Eric Davis and rear Admiral Thomas Wilson.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
The parking lot of EGNG in Las Vegas in 2002.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
And these, of course, are the meeting notes.

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
This is following a briefing from Dr. Steven Greer in 1997 that he gave to select members of Congress and other individuals.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So one of these being Steven Lovekin.

40:42.000 --> 40:49.000
If you guys remember the person I covered who talked about a, I really hope so.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I truly hope so.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
And maybe because mom's from discussed and other world technologies division.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
But anyways, back to the Wilson Davis memo.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
If you guys, I recommend watching my video on the Wilson Davis memo and maybe a slog to get through.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm sorry.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It's not my most exciting work.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
I'm sorry.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
I will revisit it.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
But if we look through this memo, it recounts meeting notes.

41:09.000 --> 41:20.000
And this is apparently about Admiral Thomas Wilson investigating the UFO program after being inspired by his discussion with Steven Greer,

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Luke Shan and others.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
And he is Stonewald.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
Apparently this program was embedded within special access programs, multi tiered.

41:28.000 --> 41:38.000
What is really interesting for me to look into now that this memo has almost been confirmed by Wilson or Eric Davis is the discussion of the project keepers.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Of course, this is Commander Will Miller.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
I've talked about him quite a bit.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Commander Will Miller.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
Let me just find the exact line about the keepers.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Because there's just so much.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I don't want to make this a full Wilson Davis video.

41:54.000 --> 42:02.000
But I really recommend kind of watching my video on it because we kind of go through a to Z of the Wilson Davis memo.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
But yes, okay.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
And the keepers of the program, I forget what they're called.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
I'm trying to think, but one of these, the watch committee, that's it.

42:13.000 --> 42:20.000
Comprising the watch committee is a security director and I say retired CI expert, a program director and a corporate attorney.

42:20.000 --> 42:28.000
And these are the people Admiral Wilson met with and was kind of Stonewald from looking more into the looking more into the project.

42:28.000 --> 42:37.000
So the program manager directly said that the uap program doesn't fit into any weapons program Intel program spec ops or logistics program.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
It was a reverse engineering program something recovered years ago in the past.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Is this magenta?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Is this rock?

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Well, is this Kingman or is this multiple?

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
I'm leaning towards multiple craft.

42:50.000 --> 42:58.000
So within the within the Wilson Davis document, this goes into further about kind of what the program says.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
The technology is not from this earth in this document.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I think MJ 12 is also.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Yeah, Miller Miller also asked about MJ 12.

43:06.000 --> 43:14.000
I can't remember right now if if whatever his name if sorry, Admiral Wilson and Eric Davis, my mind's kind of spinning right now.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm sorry guys for any mix ups.

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
But what is interesting here is for Thomas Wilson to talk about Corso Philip J Corso if you guys haven't read the day after Roswell.

43:22.000 --> 43:30.000
I would highly recommend reading that mentioned the SAP OCC and the reorganization of SAP SAP OCC and the program almost being found in an audit in the mid 90s.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
I highly recommend reading the black budget of the United States by Catherine Austin fits here.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Anyways, we'll come back to that.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
So Eric Davis.

43:40.000 --> 43:46.000
I'll read this word for word, but I, you know, I'm not really like a react content type of guy, but we'll just do that.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Okay, Eric Davis says to Andre.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
No, he told me that he would deny meeting with me.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Should I publish anything about that?

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
I never published anything about our meeting, but Ed Mitchell's unethical kids released his copy covered by Ed signed NDA of my friends of my interview notes to a friend who had an interest in UFOs.

44:02.000 --> 44:14.000
The latter individual is responsible for shopping the notes at a UFO conference to the highest bidder, which was Grant Cameron unethical Grant Cameron consulted a lawyer and decided to publicize the interview notes on this YouTube channel and a podcast.

44:14.000 --> 44:21.000
After this is when Wilson denied meeting me when contacted by multiple ufologists and UFO media personalities and mainstream news reporters.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
But here's the issue with that guys.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I have.

44:26.000 --> 44:34.000
Remember James Rigney I covered in the video he was the one who kind of got the memo out of the estate got it to Grant Cameron.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
James Rigney was not sold this document.

44:38.000 --> 44:45.000
Whoever the individual in Edgar Mitchell Oscar Edgar Mitchell's estate.

44:45.000 --> 44:53.000
Went through his files and between between James Rigney and this individual I don't know who this individual is.

44:54.000 --> 45:12.000
And James Rigney shared this with Grant Cameron in fact I have James Rigney up here because to talk about like a Edgar Mitchell's unethical kids I don't think this involved his children at all besides just a relative and Grant Cameron I don't think was sold this document as well.

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
So James Rigney says I showed these notes to Grant and then a few weeks later sent him a copy yes and I've talked to James about this he said this to me.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
To say they were hawked around to the highest bidder is ludicrous yes there was never a mention of any sale here.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
Dr Mitchell's family were not involved at all other than Dr Mitchell's nephew now deceased I'm happy to clear any of this up.

45:32.000 --> 45:45.000
James Rigney has started to he doesn't post much but I really like that he's talking about this because I think by Eric Davis here he's obviously a little emotional about the Wilson Davis memo and he might not be fully familiar with the process of how it leaked.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
But I will say before the memo made its way to public multiple people have seen the memo right multiple researchers have.

45:52.000 --> 46:06.000
I have also talked to an individual who told me in an off record conversation that he was aware of the memo years before it was ever released so there's some pretty important people who know about this.

46:06.000 --> 46:15.000
And I'm not familiar with Nicole actually actually yeah we just talked about Nicole but she has an email from Grant Cameron regarding this.

46:15.000 --> 46:26.000
She's Grant Cameron says wow someone is pissed for the record I never shop the Wilson Davis memo notes I promised James Rigney that I would put them in beyond managing magic.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
When I realized I could not do that I just made the notes free to anyone who asked about them.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Chase Williams got a copy and helped me.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
If everyone had stopped playing cover up I would never have been in such a position.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Usually Eric is pretty accurate.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
He messed up his sovereignty accusations and losing that I would have thought he would be a little more quiet.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
For the record many of the top researchers have now confirmed they have had the Wilson documents for years and chose to sit on it.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Yes, I've definitely heard that too.

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
Why must I be the guy to have to disclose stuff other to disclose stuff other disclosure researchers are hiding.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Wilson documents Johnson UFO study.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Interesting.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Douglas aircraft documents.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Interesting.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Advanced physics group notes Rockefeller initiative documents.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Interesting.

47:11.000 --> 47:22.000
And yet vindicated the alien autopsy emails for anybody who hasn't heard about the alien autopsy emails that surrounds the supposed alien autopsy film that was obviously faked in like 11 apartment.

47:22.000 --> 47:29.000
But that might be based on a real sort of autopsy there's an email chain with Dr. Kit Green that covers this.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
So that's what that's what I would like to cover that too because that's very interesting the future.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
Finally, almost all of the stuff I disclose.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
I have never read the only I only had to read the first page of the Wilson interview to know what I was holding.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Interesting to see Mitchell had to sign an NDA.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
I assume Bigelow controlled that that's very interesting Edgar Mitchell sign an NDA to receive these meeting notes.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
If businessmen can silence researchers with NDAs.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
Why is the community always crying about unethical government obeying their NDAs.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
No one ever offered me money.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Therefore, I was never forced to sign my life away and lie my ass off.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
So, yeah, I think Grant Cameron makes a really powerful statement here.

48:07.000 --> 48:15.000
So I guess the question is now, why did Eric Davis wait until 2024 to discuss the Wilson Davis Mumble.

48:15.000 --> 48:26.000
I find that Eric Davis I kind of said this earlier kind of pops up and around when he makes to make statements whether this be discounting guys like Jason Sands discounting Bob Lazar and so forth.

48:26.000 --> 48:36.000
Lou, I mean, sorry, Eric Davis has been on kind of a tear lately, talking about Lou saying that he Lou never ran all sapper and a tip specifically.

48:36.000 --> 48:44.000
So it seems that I really can't think of an exact reason why now of all times he would discuss the Wilson Davis document.

48:44.000 --> 48:55.000
If you remember back to 2004 in Stephen Green Street's basement episode, Green Street actually asked Eric Davis about the memo and Eric Davis just gave the hole.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
I cannot confirm or deny that.

48:58.000 --> 49:04.000
So why now but this is really interesting and extremely consequential.

49:04.000 --> 49:11.000
I remember back in the day, guys like John Greenwald and John Greenwald has a fantastic new video on all to all sap and a tip.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I really recommend watching that.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
But he I think he thought the Wilson Davis notes at least I'm not thought he proposed a theory they might be like a film script.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
So there was just a lot of information shopping around about them.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
So let's look at some of these comments real fast before we carry on this.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
Am I mistaken or does Robert Bigelow always seem to get a pass because he's interested in this stuff could be totally wrong.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
But does anybody ask him to put up or shut up?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
No, that's a good point.

49:38.000 --> 49:46.000
Of course, he's been interested in kind of knit, of course, behind nids and kind of a consciousness studies and after death studies.

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
He has been very quiet since a lot of this is has been discussed.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
It's because Eric Davis still has a security clearance.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Yes, pretty clear.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
The memo is real.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
That's why he has to do these obtuse attempts at obfuscation.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah, I the at least to myself, I'll admit kind of my biases here.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
I've always considered the Wilson Davis memo since I began researching it to be authentic.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
I find just so much valuable information in the memo.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
And if you guys haven't read it, I really recommend reading it.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
I think in my video on the Wilson Davis memo, I have it linked.

50:18.000 --> 50:27.000
So shall we talk about the, unless anybody has any questions, we'll discuss the 2004 kind of JSOC.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
You know, is this better for everybody at the black better for everybody's screen?

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
Probably next we'll talk about the JSOC.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
So Davis admits to what he has is controlling narrative.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
That's true.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah, that's a good point.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
That is a good point.

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
Doesn't anyone think it's weird to go with the serious TSS clearance would discuss something like this and on and not use not like signal.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
Yeah, it is weird, but I know I think it's that same Facebook group or others.

50:55.000 --> 51:01.000
Eric Davis has been very cavalier about about like Bob Lazar, Jason Sands.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
He seems to really like a kind of blab about this.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
So how do you flip the style?

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
If you have a Sumatra PDF, all you have to do is press I, and it really helps.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Sumatra PDF is the best.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I highly recommend it.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Okay.

51:15.000 --> 51:21.000
So what let's get to this last one by LC in the weaponized ed cat or weaponized episode with Ernie Klein.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
He mentions anytime he brought up the memo around Davis put off, etc.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
other spines would go rigid truth.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
So which recently Ross Colt Hart did an AMA on Reddit.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I think this is his second one.

51:34.000 --> 51:40.000
The first time he did an AMA, I think the vast majority of the questions were saying Ross tell us where the craft is in regards to what the

51:40.000 --> 51:46.000
craft is in regards to when Ross discussed a craft so large that a building had to be built around it.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
This AMA was very different.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
People asked a lot of great questions.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
Of course, people are kind of discussing skinny Bob and stuff like that again.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
And somebody said, let's see if I can pull it up.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
Sorry, I'm not like a guest browser here.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Ross called her.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
No.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I'm not a robot motorcycles.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
No, the helmets won't count.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Traffic lights really.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Why do you guys have to and you guys watch me do this?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
I'll probably mess it up.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
There we go.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
Look who we got in the chat.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Just bought.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
What's up, Michael?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Thanks so much for tuning in.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Hey, cool.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
What's going on, man?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Thank you.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
I really appreciate you tuning in.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
That's awesome.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I'm going to leave this up for a little bit.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
I really appreciate that, Michael.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
We're just about to talk about the 2004 incident and sentinels of ether.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
Just because I think so many people have been talking about John Stewart.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
And this 2004 incident and there hasn't really been a lot of look back to

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
sentinels of ether.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
So let's get started, guys.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
Shardu Shardul 127 or Shardul 27.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And this guy's actually in my discord.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
This was a fantastic question.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
So if you are watching right now, thanks, dude.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I know he posted this in the discord.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So thank you.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
This is a fantastic question.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Hi, Ross.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Thank you for all that you have done and will do with this topic.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
Is there any merit to the claim that in 2004 there was a blue on blue

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
firefight between a JSOC unit and a Lockheed Martin recovery team over

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
UAP craft resulting in the deaths of two JSOC members?

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Ross says just straight up yes and recomments.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
And that's not the only incident.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
So now we have Ross commenting on the validity out.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
And of course, this is just Ross.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
He hasn't posted any sources or data for this.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
How do I join the discord server?

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
I think I can post a link here.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Let me post it.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
Sorry, let me post that real fast.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.000
Invite people.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Yeah, if that link works.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
So, yes.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
So we have Ross cold heart commenting on a 2004 blue on blue situation.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
We have John Stewart's story.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
I believe this came out in late 2023.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
I think this was in December.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
And this was about an individual reaching out to.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Let's get Michael's chat back up here.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
That's cool.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
This was about an individual reaching out to John about a story of a blue

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
on blue firefight that occurred in, I think, I think.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
So there's a difference here now between the two sources.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
I think that Stewart source and we'll get through this as we read through.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Claim to this event occurred near the Texas side of the border in the Texas

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
and Mexico border.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Sentinels of ether talks about this being on the Koyame Mexico side of the

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
border, which as we know from the Koyame video is very close to the Texas border.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
So I'll read just this, just the initial message.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
And then we'll kind of just pick and choose through.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I don't just want to, this isn't story time.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
I'm just not going to read through everything.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Hi, John.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
I saw one of your recent podcasts.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Thank you for covering the UAP topic.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I have some information you may find useful for this.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
I served in the USMC and Defense Intelligence Agency as an intelligence

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
analyst and then moved on to Lockheed as a security program manager.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
I no longer work at Lockheed.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
I was read into the UAP program and the UAP issue is multifaceted.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
Well, generally it's known to the public at this point from the recent news

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
articles that the United States USG has its own recovery and storage team for

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
downed in HICraft.

55:27.000 --> 55:32.000
Most of the people, okay, sorry.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Most of the people in USG community know about downed craft.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
This is where the real core of the UAP issue lies, not the religious

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
implications or the biologics.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
Lockheed has had this team since the 1970s and have amassed a hoard of both

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
intact and crashed UAP at a facility in Palmdale, California.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
At some point around the mid 1980s, they were able to successfully reverse

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
engineer one of these NHICraft and keep this hidden and completely

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
obfuscated from the USG.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
One of my senior security managers was firsthand legacy witness to this.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Lockheed even relinquished some of the original NHICraft back into the

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
custody of USG and lied, quote, saying that they could make no progress.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
This is where the heart of the dispute between Congress today and Lockheed

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
is coming in to head in Schumer's recent UAP bill demanding the tech from

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
the UAP legacy program.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
The USG realized that it was lied to about, sorry, I'm just having trouble

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
reading.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
The USG realized it was lied to about the progress and now want full custody

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
of the ARV vehicles that Lockheed currently has.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
Even though I was read into the general UAP program, I was never privy to

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
this specific group while I worked for Lockheed, the in-house recovery team.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
There were only brief water cooler discussions I had with people directly

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
involved that are personal friends I've known for many years.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
So let's stop before we get into the incident here.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
USG for anyone asking is US government.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
Hey, Aiden, my contacts get dry fast.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I know I blink a lot.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
I saw that in the interview with Ryan Wood.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
I blinked a ton.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
But USG is the United States government.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
The story here, what is really interesting is so many times throughout

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
my videos, we've covered a retrieval effort, mostly like spearheaded by

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
the Air Force and so forth, Air Force elements, possibly JSOC.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
There's good reason to believe that something like the 24th STS group

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
within JSOC and the Air Force has some part to play in crash retrievals.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
There's actually a Reddit whistleblower, a supposed whistleblower a couple

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
months ago that had a really interesting testimony on this.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
But to hear this about private corporation recovery teams, this is

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
really interesting and not something that we have covered too much.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
Of course, there's the idea of these black operative black operator programs

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
that deal with craft and deal with humans and deal with operations.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
But we have never really explored the extent to which they have

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
recovered downcraft.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
So here this individual reaching out to John Stuart claims that Lockheed

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Martin has its own recovery team.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
Now, I can't remember and we'll get through this if this describes

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
kind of the experience of the operators, what they have if they're

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
former like tier one, if they're just PMC guys.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
I'm not quite sure, but this is really interesting to dive into this territory

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
about basically a private team that is not associated with kind of US

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
operations.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
As we get into this, this raises some even more interesting questions

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
how this Lockheed Martin recovery team deals with JSOC units.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
And if you don't know JSOC, this is joint special operations command.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
This is the best of the best in US armed forces.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
This is like 24th STS.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
This is one 60th division.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
This is Navy SEAL Team 6.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
This is Green Beret.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
These are just some bad dudes.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
So I'll keep, let's see how much longer we got in this.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Yeah.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Okay.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
I'll read the rest of this and then we'll discuss.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
I know of an incident in 2004 where one of Lockheed's own reverse

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
engineered ARV craft, one of Lockheed's own reverse engineered

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicle, crashed into the Southwest.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
The USG was monitoring.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
They thought it was genuine NHI craft.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
They sent their own recovery team out from JSOC, but there was a

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
violent altercation between them and the Lockheed recovery team

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
that resulted in two deaths.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
This is the incident Grush is referring to when he says people

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
have been killed to keep the UAP secret.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
This was a blue on blue situation between two completely separate

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
recovery teams.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
The USG group had no awareness of the other one.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
I was privy to the names of two cuts off our satellite office.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
However, I would not go to public and I am not sure about releasing

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
this information.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
The only caveat to this is I remember the names of the two airmen

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
that were killed, especially stuck out to me because they were

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
both clearly of Asian descent.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
I am Asian myself.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
I debated a few times trying to inquire a way to track down

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
immediate relatives and maybe contacting them.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I don't know what should be done.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Honestly, I'm fairly certain the immediate families to this day

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
are not aware of the actual circumstances regarding their passing.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I think John and him kind of go back a little bit there.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Here we are faced with the kind of, yes, I think 0604 says this

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
friendly fire here.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
This is blue on blue action here.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Like Michael says, JSOC has a bunch of good guys.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
This is really interesting.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Here we are faced with the prospect of a US based retrieval team.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
They have their rapid reaction unit and they see this craft they

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
think is an HII craft.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Then there's the Lockheed Martin team that knows that their own

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
reverse engineered ARV has crashed and they sent their team.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
There's a collision between the forces and JSOC, maybe they got the

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
jump on them, which is surprising because JSOC again is the best of

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
the best by this PMC, Private Military Corporation, almost

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Lockheed team.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
We have this story here and I will link this in the discord if

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
anybody wants to read more because there's a lot here.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But this parallels the story told by the insider that Michael has

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
spoken to who published two chapters of a manuscript called

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Sentinels of Ether, which is kind of used in this individual's

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
words as basically a ploy on dops or similar to secret machines

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
by Tom DeLonge to put truth and fiction to get out information.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I think this was also done back in the 80s or 90s with Sedge

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Masters and Project Zodiac.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
So this isn't a new tactic.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
This has been done multiple times.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And yes, that is really terrifying.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
But we won't read Sentinels of Ether, but I have just read it

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
recently so I can tell you a little more about what it's about.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
This story doesn't directly deal with a craft recovery.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
This deals with people being trafficked.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And there is basically a JSOC team that gets the jump on, not

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
necessarily the jump, but they observe this trafficking operation

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
from some Hueys.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And this JSOC team is cornered and killed brutally by whatever

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
this team is that are trafficking these individuals.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The individuals are in Koyama, Mexico, and they load up on their

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
helicopters, maybe with their cargo, maybe not, and they fly

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
to a secret base around the region.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
So those are the differences here.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
There's no mention of Lockheed in the Sentinels of Ether story.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
There's no mention of Lockheed in John Stuart's whistleblower.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
There's no mention of craft in Sentinels of Ether, but there's

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
mention of craft in John Stuart's whistleblower.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
There's a direct location given in Sentinels of Ether, including

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Koyama, Mexico.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It's a little different in John Stuart's, which calls mainland

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
US.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So those are the small differences.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Of course, we don't have direct supporting evidence, but this

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
2004, this reminds me so closely of the 1974 Koyama incident,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
which occurred 40 years later in the same place in Koyama,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Mexico.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
If you guys haven't watched that video, this is about an alleged

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
story of a crash that occurred on the Mexican side of the

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
border seen by people in kind of a remote area.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
A Mexican retrieval team is sent to investigate.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
The CIA has the jump on this recovery operation, and they send

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
in the rapid reaction unit.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
But something based on their surveillance has shown that the

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Mexican retrieval team has stopped, was killed by something.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
This is, and the Americans take over the wreckage.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Now, it's still not clear if the Mexican retrieval team was

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
killed from some sort of leakage from the craft or that the

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
US killed them.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And still, this is just a story.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
There's not a lot of evidence for that case.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I covered it because it's so interesting.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But so we have, we have the Sentinels of Ether story.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We have the 2004 John Stuart, supposed whistleblower.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And then we have the 1974 Koyame instant, which all kind of tie in

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
together.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It's an extremely interesting story.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I'll be interested to see if John Stuart has a further comment on

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
this.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
As far as I know, he hasn't said very much.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I think people have just kind of been, I think he's just kind of

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
been saying like, haha, like I got it.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I think he's just kind of been celebrating the victory on her.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
We still don't know if his whistleblower is telling the truth.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I think that this person kind of went AWOL and AFK after this

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
and John tried to follow up with him, but there wasn't, but there

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
wasn't, he couldn't get in contact with the guy.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So let's, if there's any questions now, let's, let's go through them.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I just kind of wanted to touch on that because I felt like a lot of

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
people were drawing to attention to the, to John Stuart's

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
locking Martin whistleblower, but there was some parts of the

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
puzzle missing to factor in Sentinels of Ether and the 1974

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Koyame incident.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So, yeah.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So if anybody has any questions, we'll, we'll kind of go through

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
that and maybe in about like 10, 15 minutes, we'll, we'll start

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
wrapping up.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I'm, I'm trying to think of any other kind of breaking into

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
incidents right now.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I would like to know what you guys think of imminent so far.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Again, I haven't read the full thing.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I've mostly been catching up on loose media appearances so far.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
And okay, let's, let's, let's see this.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Michael says, Ross has definitely been in touch with me on

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
some details, not too much since he's busy, but soon I expect to

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
meet with him and tell him face to face.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Now I would really be interested to see what Ross and Michael

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
discuss.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
If everybody remembers Ross's previous AMA, somebody asked him

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
like, what do you think of the Michael Herrera case?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And he says he was actively investigating.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So I'm really excited to hear further developments on that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So that's wildly exciting.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Let me get a sip of water here.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So yeah, besides that guys, again, I'm hoping to, I'm hoping to

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
see Jesse Michaels quite soon.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I think he's, I think he's coming out to the state and I'm excited to

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
meet up with him.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
We are working on the, I kind of leaked it.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I don't really like to say it, but let's, let's, the group I

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
encountered is private, but plucked from former special operations

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
groups.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I know some of them personally, but they are good guys helping me

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
with that.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Yeah.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Yeah.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Yeah.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Yeah.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And that's something I wanted to talk on.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Remember in the Arrow historical report volume one, they claimed

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
that Michael said to them that he encountered us special forces.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
No, and Michael has been clear about this since the beginning

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
that he encountered a private team that had no association that

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
he knew at the time from American special forces.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Let's, okay, let's start going through these.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I'm catching this room a bit late, but I'm so lost.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I'm not on all this.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I thoughts on all this about I, but tell me why you're lost.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Man, I'll get you up.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I know I can drag on a bit.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That's why I like to make scripts because I can just drone on

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
about AI designating designing craft and military being infiltrated

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
to the point where top secret stuff needs to be hidden.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I have a, I have a good friend who actually is working on like a

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
really good thesis about kind of the phenomenon and, and craft

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
being sort of like a really AI driven and maybe like a biomechanical

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
artificial intelligence.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.480
And so I would kind of like to follow up with him on that.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.240
Pete says, imminent as part of the drip feed of disclosure,

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.640
anything cleared for official releases.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.120
Why are they starting to disclose is the interesting part.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.160
Yeah, I agree.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.300
Why is, like, why does Dobser approve of Lou

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.800
discussing a 1950 crash retrieval case?

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.920
Why does Dobser approve of Lou

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.080
discussing Operation Interloper and so forth?

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:22.960
This is very interesting.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.280
Everything is cleared with Dobser.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.880
Same with David Grush as well.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.960
The idea of a drip feed of disclosure is interesting

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.080
because, of course, there's likely elements within USG

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.680
that are deeply entwined in the program

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.280
who do not want any of this information to come out.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.200
Is there ever a point where top secret stuff

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.040
doesn't need to be hidden?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.080
I think, I can't remember,

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.240
but I think people like Grush and Elizondo

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.880
have a great take on this.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.720
With NHI technology and so forth,

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.240
perhaps the technology itself

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.680
and how to operate this technology can remain classified.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.840
You don't need someone who would wish harm to others,

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.160
being able to harness a craft that can go supersonic

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.000
in an eighth of a second.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.960
But I think the reality of this situation

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.760
shouldn't be classified top secret.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.640
I think all of humanity has a right to know the extent

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.520
to what program officials and people high up in USG

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.520
and the military know about UFOs,

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.680
their purpose on this planet,

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.720
their modus operandi and so forth.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.520
What is your opinion on Salvador Pais?

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520
Pais is super interesting.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.880
I covered him in the Off-World Technologies Division.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.880
He worked out of NAVAR, the Naval Air Facility in Maryland.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.520
And he, of course, has patents on kind of almost like a

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.720
kind of quantum vacuum fluctuations,

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.920
powering like an almost diamond or triangular shaped craft.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.320
If you haven't, I really recommend listening to his appearance

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.320
on Kurt Geimungal's theory of everything

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.520
where he talks a little bit more about physics.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.720
Physics was never my strong suit, so I'm not,

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.320
I don't have a ton of interesting things to add there,

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.920
but Salvador Pais is super interesting.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.920
And I find his patents wild,

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.720
especially how they were initially denied,

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720
but they were picked up by the Navy.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.520
And he was working out of NAVAR, Pax River.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.920
What's up, OptiV? How you doing, man?

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.920
Great to see you.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.320
Great to see you, brother.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.720
Danny Sheehan answered Mitchell's question

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.920
in Jesse Michaels' interview.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.720
He said it's because Lockheed wants the license to tech

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720
and sell it.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.720
Okay, I haven't, I don't remember that part,

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.720
but thank you for saying that.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.720
Have I been interviewed before? No, I don't know.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.720
No, I have not.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.720
That kind of would be fun, but as you can tell,

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.720
I kind of ramble, so we'd see how that goes.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.720
Group C says imminent is crap.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.720
Excuse my French, a mix of truth and lies.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.720
That's how good disinformation works.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.720
Lou is clear to say what he says.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.720
Of course, there's still a lot of discourse around Lou,

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.720
ASAP, and ATIP.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.720
If you guys haven't, I know he can be a divisive member

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.720
in the community, but John Greenwald's recent video on kind

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.720
of the memorandums and different files that have been released

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.720
from ATIP and ASAP surrounding Lou and other players.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.720
That is super interesting, and I really highly recommend that.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.720
It makes the can of worms so much deeper.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.720
So please watch that.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.720
China stand is why Kona Blue was proposed.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.720
Lockheed went into the vest of its materials,

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.720
and Kona Blue was meant to be the way that happened,

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.720
and to the CIA put a kibosh on it.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.720
Yeah, to divest materials into the hands

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.720
of Bigelow Aerospace from Lockheed Martin.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.720
You got a signed copy of imminent.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720
That's awesome, man.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720
That's super cool.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.720
That's super cool.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.720
Since imminent had to go through the Pentagon approval

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720
for its contents, I think the section on alien implants

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.720
is a slow drip for acknowledging abduction phenomena.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.720
Scary thought.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.720
Yeah, again, we talked about implants a little earlier.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.720
I think the basis of that work needs to come off

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.720
of Dr. Lear's work throughout history,

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.720
because it's just such a strange concept

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.720
to wrap your head around, and the implications

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720
of the abduction phenomena, if true,

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.720
are extremely disturbing as well.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.720
Anytime someone monetizes UFO stuff,

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.720
I'm out, YouTube doesn't count for now.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.720
So that's like the grifter argument, right?

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.720
I don't think Lou is a grifter at all.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.720
I think that after many years, for whatever reason,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.720
he's releasing this book.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.720
But I do agree that a lot of people will just kind of make

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.720
a lot of UFO content or big claims for not much reason.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.720
But I personally wouldn't throw Lou in that category,

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720
but I still need to read all of him in it.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.720
So my opinion is not fully formed.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.720
I have one huge advice to you before you get into abjections

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.720
and all that.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.720
Learn about the science.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Listen to Tom Bearden's lectures, because if you don't,

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
you'll think that everything is E.T.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720
Absolutely.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.720
Absolutely.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720
Well, I appreciate that.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720
With any subject getting into,

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.720
I want to make sure I have a strong foundation for research.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.720
Dobser is only there to censor classified specific details.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720
Lou chooses his references carefully

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720
and tiptoes around classified details.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720
Yes, he does.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720
You can see that in the JRE interview and so forth.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.720
Lou is very good at drawing the line where he's speculating

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.720
and not speculating and drawing the line where he can't go

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.720
further and drawing the line to say,

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.720
I can't talk about this, but here is an example.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.720
Also, what do you guys think about the Lou on JRE appearance?

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.720
I think Lou, I think Joe was a lot softer on Lou

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.720
than he was on David Grush.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.720
I was re-listening to the David Grush interview recently.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.720
And Joe, a lot of the time, you see,

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.720
almost took a position of disbelief to everything Grush said,

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.720
which was a little strange to me, a little strange.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.720
Kelly Cahill is where to start looking for abductions.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.720
Gotcha.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.720
Gotcha.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.720
Do you know of any other good UAP YouTubers?

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.720
Watch all of your vids and want more info.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.720
So I don't watch too much UFO related content.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.720
And part of the reason I made this channel is I thought there was

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.720
a bit of a lapse in serious research outside of guys like Richard Dolan.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.720
So my advice would be just to read, to be honest.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:05.720
I would read Leonard Stringfield's Crash Retrievals one through seven.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.720
Those are brilliant.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.720
I would read Stephen Greer's disclosure briefing document from 2001.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.720
I would read Magic Eyes Only by Ryan Wood.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.720
I would read In Plain Sight by Ross Colthart.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:22.720
But I would also watch Ross Colthart interviews on the kind of need to know

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.720
as well as anything he's done with Bryce Zabel.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.720
There's also a lot of good old documentaries such as stuff with James Fox.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.720
So as far as content goes, I don't know.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.720
I'm not too familiar with other UFO content creators besides some of the big dogs like Dolan.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.720
Sad to hear Lou is financially hurt by TTSA.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:47.720
Yeah, of course that kind of muddies up TTSA.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.720
So what do you think about the Orbs in Lou's house?

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.720
I find it very strange.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.720
Kind of he really doesn't hesitate to go into kind of like the Hitchhiker effect of UAP

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.720
and strange stuff following him home from work at ATV.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.720
I think even his wife commented on this as well.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.720
I'll have to find her comments, but that was really interesting to see her wife talk about that.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.720
Matt's under his correction.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.720
Danny Sheehan, tiptoes and whispers to Lou.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.720
Back to Pete.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.720
And abductions are the hardest part to swallow once the realization of UAP is real.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
It's terrifying.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
I agree.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.720
The implications of abductions are very terrifying.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.720
I remember growing up that one of the first books I had was a book on Betty and Barty Hill,

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.720
and it just scared the life out of me as a kid.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.720
John Greenwald clearly has a theory about why, in his words, both sides are lying.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.720
Do you have any thoughts on what John's theory may be?

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:41.720
Yeah, I think in his latest video, he says very specifically, neither side is telling the truth.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.720
And this could just be, like I can't think for John, of course.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.720
Even though I don't always agree with everything he says,

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.720
I think John is a pretty well thought out person.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.720
He takes his time to craft his theses.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.720
So I would wait to hear from him, but of course this could possibly be,

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.720
he just thinks this is room to muddy the water around the UAP discussion

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.720
and create endless debate about atyp and asap.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.720
I talked about this already, but how is Japan?

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.720
Japan was the greatest place I've ever been and has the best food I've ever had.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.720
I want to go back so bad.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.720
I didn't get to go to Kodokanjudo in Tokyo and I went to so bad.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.720
So bad.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.720
It was obviously a PR deal and Joe didn't take it seriously with Grush or Lou.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.720
Yeah, it was strange that he didn't take it seriously.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.720
I think that David Grush is one of the most valuable people to speak to right now.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.720
So it was strange.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.720
It was bizarre, Lou.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.720
I think he made a conscious effort and he talked about this on JRE,

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.720
that he was on JRE to talk about the phenomenon and not plug his own book,

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.720
which I definitely respect, but he gave John Greenwald a huge shout out.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.720
And I know that Greenwald has had his huge problems

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.720
and has been very outspoken about Lou.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.720
So that was interesting to see.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.720
I think it's curious how all the Senate hearings started right after the Chinese balloon.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.720
What are the odds that UAP topic is used as a vehicle to pass reforms with that deal with foreign stuff?

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.720
I do not think so because if we look at the Schumann legislation for both 2023 and 2024,

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:07.720
it is very, very, very clear that the subject we're dealing with is non-human technology and legacy programs.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.720
Very clear.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:16.720
I think in the 2024 NDAA, non-human intelligence has mentioned about 27 times, I think it is.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.720
I feel like him not plugging his book was partially to avoid.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.720
I agree.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.720
I agree.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.720
Timothy Good's Unearthly Disclosure is an excellent book.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.720
Yes.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.720
And was it Timothy Good that also wrote above?

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.720
They're not above Top Secret.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.720
Need to know was that his book, but Timothy Good is great.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.720
I can't remember right now.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.720
If Lou can do remote view, why doesn't he hold a bit of demonstrations?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.720
Unlike UFO UAP, he has control on that.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.720
I would like to see demonstrations from people who claim they can operate remote viewing.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.720
I feel such a strange territory for me.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.720
I'd really like to see that.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.720
First thought was a skunk work spying on him.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.720
I'd like to understand the technology behind those dang orbs then, especially if they can operate indoors.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.720
I have a three paragraph argument regarding UAP origins and the phenomena of abductions.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.720
If anyone is interested to see it, where could I post?

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:11.720
My friend, you could email that to me at uapgrub at gmail.com or you could join my discord and post that to see.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.720
I'll copy that and put the link in one more time because I'd love to read it.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.720
I'd absolutely love to read it.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.720
Sounds awesome.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.720
Lou's wife was in the News Nation interview.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.720
Okay.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.720
The grifter argument makes no sense.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720
Take Greer, for example.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.720
He does two CE5 events a year.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720
He's not a millionaire.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720
How can he fund the disclosure project?

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.720
Whistleblower needs his events with no money.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:42.720
I bet Greer, I do think that Greer has income streams outside of just UAP if I had to guess.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.720
I know he used to be a practicing ER trauma doctor, but I'm not sure.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:52.720
Mike says, I'm not sure why, but it seems very human that the orbs followed him after he was investigating from within the Pentagon.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.720
That's very strange.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.720
I need to read that passage in imminent.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.720
Again, sort of like with remote viewing and stuff, that territory is very foreign for me.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:08.720
I approach it slowly when I read about it because it's uncomfortable for me, which I'm sure it is for many of you.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.720
What is your methodology for conducting research?

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.720
That is a really good question.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.720
I really appreciate that.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:25.720
When I'm investigating a crash retrieval, for example, I will find a respected person that has covered this crash retrieval before.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:32.720
For example, for the 1974 case in Koyame, Mexico, that was Ryan Wood in Magic Eyes Only.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.720
He covered the case.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.720
I use that as a starting point.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.720
From that, I make a personal note sheet for myself of every single aspect I want to check out.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.720
Then every single aspect, for example, Koyame mentions Fort Bliss and stuff like that.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.720
I will go look at ufo-search.com, which is a great website by Richard Geldreich.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.720
I can't remember that post events by date.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:05.720
I will start researching if there's any blue book, sorry, not blue book, but any recorded sightings or information on that day.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.720
If any official documents have been released about aspects of Fort Bliss and operations there on that day,

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.720
or any official documents exist around that case, I'll analyze the Moondust Archive.

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.720
I'll analyze the Blue Book Archive.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.720
I'll analyze if any popular figures on UAP disclosure have talked about this.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.720
Then I'll start researching the subject I'm working on in books.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:31.720
For example, I know when I covered a ufo case, I had to go into some of Jacques Valet's old works.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.720
My research always conducts with starting a foundational layer and topics I want to branch out on,

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:43.720
and using various websites and books to find out more information and continue that as a decision tree.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:50.720
The most important part for my research, as I'm sure it would be for anybody, is really good record keeping,

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.720
because there's so much you can find when researching any case.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.720
What's important to me is to have bullet points for subjects and appropriate links,

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:05.720
and from there have even further offshoots and just dive into what I find interesting about the cases.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:12.720
Then when I can form a thesis, I'll start to think how I can write a topic when using my references and evidence.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.720
I'm an engineer by trait, so I approach each script as I would, like an engineering research paper,

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:27.720
kind of like an introduction, an abstract, the data, the investigation, the conclusion, the references, and so forth.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.720
Keep up the great work. Thank you, man. You're one of the very few people that do thorough research.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.720
You're like Richard Dolan in his early days, and not only not as naive. I appreciate that. I love you too, man.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.720
Thank you so much. I love doing this. This topic is so multifaceted.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:46.720
It's so tough to kind of get to the bottom of anything, so I'm just kind of trying to do my part,

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.720
slowing things down, analyze things on a case-by-case or topic-by-topic basis.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.720
Steph says, hey, Grubb, appreciate you for life, brother, and thank you, man.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.720
I'm sure thousands of us feel the same. What do you think the phenomena actually is?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.720
What's your theory so far if you could share? Sorry if asked.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.720
So this has always been really interesting.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.720
I've always kind of bounced between the thought of extraterrestrials versus

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.720
what some people like to refer to as, like, ultra-terrestrials,

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:20.720
a.k.a. beams that may not exist in our three dimensions, spatial dimensions, and one temporal dimension.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:28.720
Lately, I've found quite a bit of credible testimony that refers to crashed craft as specifically extraterrestrial.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.720
So there could be a combination of a presence on this planet, extraterrestrial,

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.720
and some things that don't necessarily exist in maybe a corporeal body

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.720
or what we would think as a physical being.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:47.720
But right now, if I just had to think out loud and just kind of say,

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.720
here's what I think for crash retrievals and these crashed craft,

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:56.720
right now I lean more towards just a pure extraterrestrial source.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.720
Another thing I feel could be possible is that these craft, through its own AI,

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.720
may be able to access psychic wavelengths themselves.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.720
What explain a lot of behaviors that people have experienced?

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.720
Yeah, absolutely. Find various methodologies and kind of,

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.720
I don't know what sort of wave, maybe radio waves,

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.720
a frequency that can start to distort cognition and so forth.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.720
Yeah, I agree with you. I think that's a great point.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.720
I wrote it over at post-disclosure. Where can we find that, my friend?

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.720
I'd love to see it.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.720
When are you going to upload the video on the glass ball that reacted to consciousness?

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.720
I have uploaded that. That is the Off-World Technologies Division.

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.720
Now, there is an individual that I am speaking to and that's really great

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.720
that has also claimed to have observed such a thing.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.720
So I hope I have an update on that because it's very interesting.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.720
Okay, Michael, Greer does real estate as well, so he's making money with that.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.720
Not sure if he does that as much. Perfect.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.720
Okay, we know that besides just CE5, that Greer has other streams of income.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.720
Sorry, I wrote it over at post-disclosure, but so far no one is reading it.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.720
Hey, post it over here. Post in the Discord, man. People here, we take this seriously.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.720
People will want to read this. I promise you, man, I certainly will.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:14.720
He then talked to the CIA guy and Joe seemed like he doubted the whole UAP thing, not going to lie.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:21.720
Yeah, Mike Baker always seems to pop up whenever Joe talks to a UAP guy.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.720
Mike Baker, I've seen a lot of comments on Reddit and so forth saying that Mike Baker is his handler.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:33.720
I think that's hilarious. I think Mike Baker has appeared on JRE 14 times, which is a lot.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.720
So, you know, whatever.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.720
Zach, that English dude tried pretty hard to nail Lou down to no avail.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.720
I didn't love Lou's answers, makes it sound like he wants to stop corruption,

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.720
but also won't point out what the corruption is.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.720
That's the English channel, the sort of smaller channel.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.720
Props to that guy for getting an interview with Lou. That's really cool to hear.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.720
I haven't listened to that yet, so I absolutely will.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.720
I know a couple clips of that are going around now.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.720
Spoonbending parties, isn't that Yuri Geller's claim?

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.720
If I'm remembering correctly, the spoonbending.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:11.720
Why would an interdimensional capable ET race abduct humans and put implants in them to track them, et cetera?

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:12.720
It's a very human thing.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.720
ETs don't need it and they can do it without physical contact.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:23.720
Yeah, I mean, there's so many, whenever you reach hypothesis like extraterrestrial or even ultra dimensional or something like that,

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.720
there's still so many questions.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.720
I know one of my good friends who really thinks this,

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:33.720
the whole phenomenon comes down to a sort of advanced planetary AI that originates from outside our solar system.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.720
He's got a lot to add here.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.720
I think everybody on this planet has their own UFO stories.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.720
I mean, a lot of people do.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.720
I never really talk about it because to me, just a single witness testimony, there's not much to it.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:53.720
I, of course, multiple times in my life have just seen lights in the sky making very sharp turns, not satellites,

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.720
because I'm always very careful to pay attention to that.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.720
Bright lights that seem to make angles are kind of dart around in the sky.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.720
I don't pay too much attention because I have no confirming evidence.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.720
I have no kind of multi-sensor detection.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:12.720
But I, you know, I like, I'd say a lot of people have seen strange things in the sky.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.720
Kudos for remaining open-minded and getting into the personal infighting that plays the community.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.720
Yeah, man.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:24.720
I've noticed on Twitter, there's a lot of, a heck of a lot of drama, especially around Lou, so much drama.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.720
I don't know how you could investigate fighting like that.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.720
So I don't, I don't want to get into that.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.720
Chris Bledsoe, I don't really have an opinion right now.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.720
I'm reserving judgment for doing a deeper dive on, on Chris.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:46.720
I've heard favorable and unfavorable things about Mr. Bledsoe, but right now I do not have much, much to go on.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.720
Am I skeptical about remote viewing?

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.720
It's highly skeptical to me.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.720
This is such a, this is a great question.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.720
If you asked me a couple of months ago, I'd say a lot of the woo connected with the phenomenon is like a very strange.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:04.720
Over time, just reading kind of the research papers from SRI and SAIC, listening to David Grush talk about Stargate and now Lou.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.720
And even people I trust like Ryan Wood even commented on remote viewing and so forth.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.720
I, I find that I, I've never observed any instance of remote viewing.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720
I cannot do it.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.720
I don't know anybody that can.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.720
So I've not seen evidence, but my mind is a lot more open to it than before.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.720
Of course, the more you study the UFOs, the more kind of strange things and psychic phenomena get introduced.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.720
So it's, it's, it's very tough to separate the two.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.720
It's very interesting.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:39.720
And like I always say, it's a really kind of uncomfortable territory for me because I've never interacted with anybody who claims to have psionic abilities or be psychic.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.720
So I would really like to see a remote viewing demonstration if I'm being honest.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.720
Have I read loose threads by Omega point?

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.720
I have not my friend, but I will write that down because that sounds.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.720
Any book.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.720
I will absolutely read.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.720
Thank you.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.720
The hitchhiker effect is a real thing, not just with UAP agreed.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.720
Tom Bearden explains in detail down to the equations, how to make orbs and anti-gravity craft in one of his lecturers called psychotronics.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.720
It's on YouTube.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.720
I have, I've not watched that lecture.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.720
So I, I got, I got some good homework to do.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:11.720
Thank you.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.720
Let's always the real deal.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720
All right.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:22.720
Then I will, I will continue to research and when I spend some time to sit down with Chris, have you seen one of the new Ross cold heart reality checks with MJ 12?

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.720
It gave credential to MJ 12 because of the 2022 JFK.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.720
Yes, I have.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.720
And that was with the Australian gentleman.

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:29.720
That was fantastic.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.720
In my MJ 12 document, I kind of referenced it because Lou had just talked about it.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.720
It kind of really renewed interest in MJ 12 and JFK.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720
Fantastic.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.720
Ross is, Ross does some really great work.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.720
And that Australian researcher is awesome too.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.720
That dude was recalling facts off the top of his head, like nobody's business.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.720
First, all your chain are covering the UFO flag.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.720
Hey, cool.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720
That was forever ago.

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.720
It looks to just too odd to be fake.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.720
Watch it on loop sometimes.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.720
You know what?

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.720
Now after the claims of Lou, I'd like, and of course, Grush last year, I'd like to see some of that dang 4k satellite footage.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.720
Who would you say is the John Mack of today?

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.720
That's a great question.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:08.720
I have no idea.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.720
I don't know if anybody is doing the serious work today that kind of John Mack did.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.720
John Mack was really ahead of his time, took the abduction phenomenon so seriously.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.720
I really respect John Mack's work.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.720
The Wilson Davis was pretty much known to be real.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.720
Yes, but he finally confirmed it in Facebook group.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.720
I feel bad for him because he had to take the hit on some trustworthiness with his clearance.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.720
Yes.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:35.720
I think a lot of people kind of saw the validity in the Wilson Davis memo, including the context around it and so forth.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.720
Thank you for answering.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.720
Thank you, man.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.720
I appreciate that.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.720
You take care and stay safe as well, brother.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.720
Matt, I've been in Battelle facilities in Columbus and West Jeff, Ohio.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:51.720
Do not see anything UAP related, but they def have the security and facilities to keep it hidden beyond what I could access.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.720
I think it's Lou who discusses now for Detrick in Maryland containing biologics.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.720
And so that's a great research avenue to go down now.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.720
Thank you so much for all.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.720
Thank you, Matt.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.720
I appreciate that.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.720
Integrity is definitely something I hold near and dear.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.720
I may seem kind of like an idiot sometimes, but if I'm unfamiliar with the topic or something, I don't know.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.720
I promise you, I'll always tell you if kind of my knowledge on something isn't up to snuff.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.720
I think it's important.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.720
I don't have all the answers to this.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.720
I just might be well versed in some of the cases I've covered.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.720
Shout out to I will always matter.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.720
The chat can get the chat can get tough to read by everybody's putting in the questions to speak to me.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.720
So I will always try to answer every single question.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.720
The sphere does sound a lot like the the bet sphere.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:44.720
What was interesting to me how this was described the sphere at this division was the sort of indent on top as if one would place a hand.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.720
But it does.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.720
It is similar to the the bet sphere.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.720
Have you seen, have you dived into eyes on cinema?

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.720
Yeah.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.720
Eyes on cinema is really good.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.720
I don't know how the heck they get some of their their footage.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:01.720
I mean, they have some great stuff down to like old interviews with Ryan Wood and Dr. Robert Wood.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.720
I've never seen in my life before.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:04.720
I don't know how they do that.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.720
They have amazing footage.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.720
I don't know for sure, but pretty sure you can pay.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.720
You can pay to get to get on JRE.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.720
Really?

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.720
That's I don't know if I'd want to go.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.720
I don't know.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.720
That'd be a fun experience, but I don't think I'm there yet.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.720
I know it's far from your top priority and I really appreciate that you don't chase the algorithm, but I really hope to see you get the credit.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.720
I hope so, man.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.720
That'd be really cool to kind of have a bigger platform to talk about this.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.720
But, you know, we grow, we are we are grown steady.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.720
We're almost at 10,000 subscribers in nine, a little less than nine months.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.720
So that's really, really great.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.720
And shout out Michael Herrera for being a legend.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.720
Yeah.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.720
Thank you so much, Michael, for joining the chat.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.720
If you're still here, that that's so awesome to see you in here.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.720
That English dude.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.720
You got Sean and Rob Tanner.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:53.720
You know, I got Sean.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.720
I don't even like Sean O'Malley, but sugar show is going to knock him out clean.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.720
This upcoming weekend is a treat for sports fans.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:06.720
We got one fight night Denver, which I didn't get tickets to.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.720
And then we have fight night Gilbert Burns, Sean Brady, great fight night.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.720
And then Sunday we got them Cincinnati bangles playing.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:16.720
So I'm sorry to my girlfriend, but we're watching a lot of sports this weekend.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.720
Thanks.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.720
Just email it to you.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.720
Thank you very much.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.720
I will read it either tonight or tomorrow when I catch up with my emails.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.720
Thank you.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.720
OptiV because the phenomenon is real and people within the government know this.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.720
It would be illegal for a lot of these whistleblowers to reveal too much.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720
They go to prison and truth remain obscured.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.720
I think even the whistleblower protection act doesn't cover pensions.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:38.720
So even whistleblowers coming forward, there's still a very real threat to how they will

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.720
provide for their family, especially after they've had a long and industrious military

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.720
or kind of intelligence or USG career.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.720
I think that's a big concern for a lot of whistleblowers that's being overlooked.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.720
No pension security is offered here with whistleblower protection.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.720
How can we assume what NHI is capable of or not?

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.720
It makes sense to me that they would use implants to do detailed monitoring.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.720
Yeah, of course, with NHI, non-human intelligence, it's very difficult to kind of attribute human

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.720
traits, human thought processes or human capabilities to something that is not human.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:19.720
We know they can manipulate physics as we know it to travel almost instantaneously, accelerate

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:24.720
and perform feats of acceleration and deceleration that would turn humans and our best ballistic

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.720
missiles into piles of grease.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.720
So, yeah, to kind of assume what they're capable or not capable of is tough speculation.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.720
Anytime any topic gets a lot of clicks, eyeballs, you will get those who want to take advantage

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.720
of it just don't be a fool.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:38.720
Yeah, I agree.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.720
That's why I tend not to do like news of the day type stuff.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:47.720
I like to sit back and really spend my time researching stuff and really spend my time

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.720
focusing on one case at a time.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.720
Doing kind of the news of the day stuff, you can really get caught up in a lot of stuff

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.720
and that's just not really my style either.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.720
Michael says, thank you to Pete.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:01.720
I'm just a guy who talked about some crazy stuff and that happened.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.720
Little did I know how much we connect the dots.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.720
Thank you, Michael.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.720
Mr. T. What's up, man?

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:07.720
How you doing?

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.720
Whitley Streber's implants given the ability to pull up information about anything in his

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.720
vision while he's writing.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.720
That sounds like the eyes from the Black Mirror episode.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:20.720
Do you know the episode where the, the some husband like it gets blocked by his wife also

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.720
in white Christmas?

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.720
Is it true you grew up within walking distance to Lockheed in Littleton says Jim Shoe?

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.720
Yes, I did.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:32.720
The Lockheed Deer Creek facility in Littleton was walking distance.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.720
It's nestled within the start of the Rocky Mountains right after what we call the Hogback,

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.720
which is where two tectonic plates push up against each other.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.720
Rumor has it that facility goes deep into the mountains.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:48.720
I lived about a four minute, five minute walk from one of Lockheed's biggest, biggest locations.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.720
Thank you for all you do.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:50.720
I appreciate it.

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:51.720
Thank you, my brother.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.720
I will answer any question.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:56.720
UFOs seem to be becoming a gateway to witchcraft.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:02.720
A lot more people are starting to kind of dive into kind of like a more woo as people call it,

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.720
like a psionic stuff, psychic stuff as they talk about UFOs.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.720
It's actually really exploded this year.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.720
So I do agree with you.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.720
Have you watched the Men Who Stare at Goats?

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.720
Great movie about remote view.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.720
I haven't seen that since it was in theaters, man.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.720
That is a good movie, Men Who Stare at Goats.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.720
I need to watch that again.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.720
I highly recommend Loose Threads.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.720
I will be reading it, my friend.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.720
I would highly recommend you watch the Joe McGonagall interview on Sean Ryan.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720
Absolutely.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.720
I love Sean Ryan's projects.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.720
Absolutely.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.720
That sounds great.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.720
Have you noticed the sudden rise in USO stuff now?

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.720
Yes.

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:39.720
Since Timothy Gallaudet has spoken about it, there's a lot of buzz about USO.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.720
This is a great topic.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.720
I hope it really starts to get covered.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:49.720
I know a lot of guys like Green Wall or sorry, Green Street and McWest like to point to a

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:55.720
new video of a transmedial concept for a Chinese drone being behind all USO sightings.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.720
But no, sir.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.720
We have done a couple of USO videos on this channel and some USO cases are some of the

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:01.720
most interesting.

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.720
I think back to Kevin Knuth at the Seoul Foundation who discussed a case where a USO

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.720
traveled under a New Zealand destroyership knocking out all the power.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.720
I had a great conversation with this about my family the other night.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.720
My younger brother asked where to start and your channel, Red Panic Wallace, intro videos

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:18.720
were my number one picks.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.720
Thank you, man.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.720
Red Panic Wallace, his documentaries are classics.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.720
Those are fantastic.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.720
They're so good.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.720
They're so good.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.720
Max Barr, have I looked into the gate program?

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720
Ross Colhart mentioned it in an AMA a few days ago.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.720
Not yet, but that is on my list of stuff to research after I finish.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:40.720
I've worked with Kecksburg in a certain private corporation that Mr. Kermit has also helped

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.720
me look into.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:47.720
RV is very real and it's so easily allowable that people deny it.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.720
I really want to see remote viewing demonstration.

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:56.060
I struggled with it because I've never personally been able to do such a thing or have viewed

01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:00.720
it, but I would really love to see situations of remote viewing.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.220
My mind is open to it.

01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:03.720
I really want to see it.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.960
Please quit your day job to do this full-time. I'd love to if the if the bills can be paid that be

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:14.920
That'd be great. Do you think mj-12 could be a scythe for the us created for russia? That is the claim of

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.480
Mr. John B. Alexander

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.640
If you recognize if you recognize the

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.160
likely reality of ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:30.920
It does not make sense to me to create a program for the russians to draw attention to ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.160
especially how

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:37.800
how the majestic files reference so much of roswell and and other cases and

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.440
Vannevar bush and some key players who were

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:46.360
You know even outside of their association with mj-12 general nathan twining really senior us guys

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.400
It seems strange to me to bring a lot of attention to them

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:55.400
So maybe some documents could be but i struggle to personally see how the whole set of mj-12 documents as a whole could be

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.800
Used for russian disinformation

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.600
Writing you now re eric mitchell. Please keep an eye. Yes, absolutely

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:08.920
What do you think of warner von bran's warning that one day will be told ufo's are a threat which happens since 2017

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:17.800
Yeah, the the threat narrative that weaves in with project blue beam if if i'm correct, right a lot of people like to

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.680
point to

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:26.360
Reagan's speech re says i think of a world where like our nations would be united under the threat of an alien invasion

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.280
Uh, I think it's interesting. I definitely think lu and the ttsa guys more so than somebody like grush

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.600
kind of, um discuss the

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:37.800
Danger of uap

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:46.040
Which I I I don't really have an opinion there, but I do notice that that lu discusses more of the danger of uap and I find it very interesting

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.080
Very interesting

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.880
Do you bother with ancient text or religious references that seem like uap or strictly to docks from the last 100 years?

01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.000
No, when I when I first started talking to my friends about this because my channel first started like a huge

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.200
PowerPoint for my friends

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:06.040
I think it ended up being like 300 slides before I said i'm just going to make videos

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.520
I prefer more time spent on individual topics

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:15.240
I did reference many cases from before the past 100 years including the settings over nuremberg the 1897

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.720
aurora texas supposed an incident

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.640
Some interesting lights seen in like 1100 in jerusalem and so forth

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.440
So there's a lot of really interesting sightings over the course of history the san diego sphere

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.600
By yes, the the full like 17 video 17 minute video by it's redacted is great

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.800
The san diego sphere

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:38.200
It seems to be like a small metallic sphere with like a row of of almost like black portholes around it

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.680
Even though there's nothing to signify there's lights, but with three or two or three almost antennae often

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.640
I recommend going to watch that video. It's it's really interesting

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.400
I get the feeling we maybe do for a mass public UFO sighting

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.400
They just seem to have happened every decade or two within the last

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.680
I can think of being the 2006 oh hair UFO just before smartphones

01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.760
That'd be great if we could get something a modern day like the 1952 UFOs over washington dc. That'd be fantastic

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:07.080
After reading loose book I'm taking a remote viewing more seriously, but I'm disappointed with russell targ's third eye spies

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.080
Hopefully there are some other resources giving us a working model now. I'd like to know

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.280
If you're starting to dive into the topic of remote viewing what sort of sources are you?

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.360
Reading about and so forth. So I might be able to piggyback off some of that research

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:26.040
I need to kind of understand more of about where to start besides just reading the research papers from sri

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.520
And s a i c and stargate and so forth

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.720
Tanner, yes, you have been here since the get go man. I remember you commenting on the first video

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.400
So I really really really appreciate it really appreciated

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.520
What topic would you introduce to joe?

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.000
I would just want to talk about crash retrievals for like three hours to be honest

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:50.840
I know we talk about many topics here, but the sort of similar to ryan wood crash retrievals is what I

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:57.160
View as my bread and butter for investigation. There's nothing more that I love than looking into a crash retrieval case

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:06.920
Uh sick card this week. Yeah, the the uh brady burns card is very good and also uh haggardy and superluck and Denver on one

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.840
That's a great one championship. Zach

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:13.480
Oh, and if you don't use it you need to get the hour breakdown of the wilson davis memo richard dolin does with mr

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.960
X who I think is travis taylor they go into every single detail

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.240
Oh, that sounds great. Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen that that sound. I would love to watch that

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.880
We'll be seeing you a few years in jerry as a legitimate boots on the ground

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.760
I'd love that and I'd also love to uh, you guys know joe does jiu jitsu. He's a blockbot

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.440
I'd love to roll around with him a little bit joe is a short stocky man

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.360
So he could probably give me some trouble on the mats

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.720
O'Malley has grown on me. I agree, but o'malley is nasty with his striking

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.480
I mean anybody but cheeto vera with a titanium skull would have gotten

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.880
Eviscerated by that knee up the middle. O'Malley's a beast. He looks like a sideshow attraction, but he's a beast

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:58.120
I will continue. I can't continue to believe youtube is effing with your channel. Come on. You should be well over 50k

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.080
Do you think anyone? No, I don't want to go. I don't want to go into

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.000
Subjects like that. Maybe it's just difficult. Maybe there's

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.920
There needs to be over time. There will be more of a growth and interest in the uap topic. So

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.880
We'll see we won't we won't go into that

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.040
We won't go into that now

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:20.760
Now I remember when bob lasar was on jerry. He also talked about a sphere that was an s4 when I had a dent

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.120
Really, I don't remember that. I'm going to look back at that now

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.880
I remember back when that uh, I think it was 2019 if I'm remembering when bob and uh, jeremy corbel went on jerry. That was awesome

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.800
What are your views on philip j corso's claims the day after roswell is a very interesting book

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:45.000
And I've been told recently by somebody very credible that I just got in contact with and I'm talking to to make specific note of

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.120
What corso states uh happened with the technology gleaned off the roswell craft?

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:55.160
So I'm actively pursuing some investigations off of corso's work right now if that answers the question

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.280
I got to say this chat. Yeah, this chat is this chat is great. I mean we got

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:05.000
Mr. Michael Herrera in the chat talking to people we've got people asking great comments

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:13.240
This chat is lovely. I've been in other chats where people are just saying wild stuff. So I very very very much appreciate this

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:15.880
Have I ever spoken to jessie michaels? Yes jessie michaels is my friend

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.000
I jessie michaels is such a cool dude

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:23.160
He first got in contact with him on my kingman video and

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.200
Maybe this week I will be hanging out with jessie michaels this week or next and I can't wait jessie's awesome

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.920
He's done so much for this subject made so many great videos. I really can't wait

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:38.840
One thing about ai is that it needs to be taught constantly any chance you think the internet is how it studies us

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:45.240
That would from a from an ai studying the internet would be the perfect way to kind of understand the zeitgeist of humanity

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:51.240
Now would I be worried that an ai would be looking at the internet to gleam off humans and look at the memes and all the terrible things online?

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.960
Absolutely, but I I think that that's very valid

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.640
I I think that's a great method for even the a biological based

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:01.880
Non-human intelligence species to simply understand humanity at a glance

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.920
Michael Herrera is a legend. He is a legend

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.760
That's weird timing

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.160
That is weird timing. I was just listening to his

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.880
Interview with william paulik the other day

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.640
Uh because I found it in the files of greer that wasn't on youtube apparently

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.680
It wasn't until paulik's death in about 2005 or 2007 that his family agreed for this to be published

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:29.160
william paulik talks about deep projects including implants uh for for operators and so forth made out of a

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:34.840
Facility near denver. This is a very interesting case and that's actually really weird timing. You bring that up

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.240
I've never seen anybody else talk about mr. Paulik

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.200
So that's great. Um

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.080
See what a michael say thanks matt. I hope what I break open soon at some point will be legendary and help

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.080
I would love that. I cannot wait to cover that

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.240
Speaking of goats big ups to all the goats in this chat. Yeah, everybody here's amazing. Thank you for for everybody

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.760
Um everybody I just joined bro. You're covering the best the best wilson davis moment majestic documents

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:05.320
You know, I got a shout out to everybody that has uh kind of helped me in my investigation been there for me

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:10.520
Uh, everybody has helped so much. So whether it be joey michael ryan wood

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:16.440
Mr. R. A. There's so many great guys that so many wonderful people around me

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:24.360
You and jesse michaels go deeper into research, uh, except for maybe richard olan jesse's video on t towns and brown is a classic

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:31.240
And this video with grush is a classic jesse is awesome and jesse just watched the program too. So I am so jealous of that, dude

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.840
You made me do it. You made me do a 180 on michael. Dude's a hero. Yes, sir

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.440
I'm i'm loving seeing everybody. I'm loving seeing everybody be so warm to michael in the chat. That's awesome

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.320
Makes perfect sense. It'll be in the ocean. I also bet millionaires in general have been expanding there. So it makes sense

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:53.880
Uh, they found a magladon or something. Yeah, I've uh started starting to really shift a lot of research into uh

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:59.960
Subaquatic have you ever looked into nazis going to Antarctica to advanced tech and do climate control there? Do you believe they went?

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:05.720
Uh, I have been I have not like serious research, but of course I've studied the the subject

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:12.040
I think there was a nazi Antarctic submarine base at the very least right and of course there was a nazi presence near

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.640
Argentina and so forth. So that is a really interesting avenue of research

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:22.200
I i'm not too well versed in advanced tech like if they tried to research de klok or something like that for but, um

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:28.120
Yeah, interesting good words from michael. I always encourage everyone to be highly skeptical on the subject too many people

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.160
Looking to make money and sacrifice morals agreed

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:37.320
Do you expect to see brand new whistleblowers in the new hearing? I hope so. Um

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.360
I haven't heard any rumors or anything

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.960
So I don't have much to add

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.960
But I would really like to see some uh first-hand whistleblowers. Maybe carl nel

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:52.120
Uh another person maybe carl nel grush and then two new whistleblowers with first-hand experience

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.360
uh

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.360
Okay, let's sorry

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.400
Um

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.400
Are there uap related topics you plan to avoid indefinitely?

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:11.400
Yeah, just community drama. Um, I won't really ever get into community drama. I think anything else in uap

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.320
Deserves a serious research of investigation. Um, so really anything. I mean we were talking about earlier

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320
I even have my problems with steven greer, but

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.000
I

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.960
Absolutely would talk to him. I'd cover him. Uh, I'd love to do it

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.000
I will do a deep dive on the disclosure briefing document, but yeah everything but community drama

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.520
I'd I'd love to cover. I'm trying to think if there's any specific people I wouldn't cover

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.520
I don't know

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:36.520
I have to think about that

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:44.200
One theory I have is that aliens are just human animal hybrids grown because the time inside the craft goes by too quickly for any normal human to test

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:48.840
Human animal the human animal hybrids that is a frightening

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:53.480
Thought the time inside the craft goes by too quickly. That's an interesting thought you bring up

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.640
My mind is drawn to an article that was published and deleted right before the

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.400
congressional hearings in july of 2023 with david crush

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.720
It was an article written by or featuring quotes by she hand that described a craft

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.840
That a recovery team witnessed that when they went inside the interior was as large as a football field

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.040
so

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.040
That kind of subject of uh

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.000
Spatial warps with uh with craft is very interesting

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.640
Very interesting. Um

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.520
These are hard

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.280
These are hard uh to investigate and proof that her era case might be easier to prove

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.400
Yeah, we're still there's still so much of the um indonesia experience where we're still

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.880
Really actively investigate investigating a lot there

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.800
Thank you rattle keep up the support for greb. Thank you. I appreciate that michael

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.880
Scott castle interviews about his us. Oh encounter is pretty interesting surprise. It hasn't gotten more attention

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.880
I have not heard of that so i'm going to write that down

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.920
Awesome

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.160
And then in about 10 minutes we'll sign off my friends

01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:02.280
But we'll keep getting through these uh questions and we'll we'll continue to uh, we'll continue to go through

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:08.200
I've suspected there's probably an nh i presence for a while now kevin knuth seems to think that an organism can survive in oceans

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.440
They can hop from planet to planet in planets that just have oceans. That's an interesting theory

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.880
Of course with uap. There's also the subject of von neumann replicating probes

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.600
If any of you guys have heard of the channel, um john michael godier. He's really physics based

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.640
He has a podcast called event horizon. Check out his channel. He always talks about von neumann probes, which is a

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:32.920
A method a type of self replicating probe that even like a sub facet than light civilization could expand into the galaxy and the cosmos

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.240
So yeah, a lot of interesting things there

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.720
Was roswell a real ufo crash? Um, I personally think so

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:46.120
I think roswell is one of the most well documented crashes and my confidence in kingman has been growing by the day

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.440
Growing by the day

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:53.000
Edgar mitchell was from roswell. Some of the locals told him it was real. Yes. Yes. Absolutely

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:59.320
Please have mh on again the fact he's here in the chat speaks volumes when there's new breaks in the case

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:05.320
Absolutely with joey as well can't leave joey out of it. Nuremberg was debunked for me personally by richard dolan

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:10.040
I think he does a great job of breaking down why it's most likely not a real event interesting

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.640
Interesting, okay

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.120
You told us you were an engineer what kind of field mechanical

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.080
But over time do less mechanical engineering more like

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.120
Service in qa when I was in university. I was told I'd be doing really cool things with math

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.680
And that was never really the case. So that's unfortunate. But that's just how it is

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.800
Um, it was fun to go to school for that

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:38.680
Richard dolan's wife is a noted RVer if I ever get to talk to oh eras says that as well if I talk to dolan

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.560
I'd love to hear more about that. I really would I really would

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.120
Let's see

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.400
Let's see

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:54.760
Isn't this remote viewing known as astral projection related to the meditation and getting into a dream state

01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.120
Audits relevant here again if aliens are demonic doing remote viewing not going to be good. Yeah, I agreed there

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:02.120
I think the relevance occurs just with

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:07.240
Many claims now that's sort of like a almost like a conscious interface is needed for

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.680
Interacting with craft and piloting craft

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:15.640
But the extent of which there's some disturbing implications just like you've said

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.720
Jimmy akin documented his participation in a remote viewing experience in progress

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.880
He's not remote viewing but basically a hide-and-seek type experiment. That's interesting. I'm going to look into jimmy

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.200
I

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.640
Interesting thank you

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.560
I love seeing you guys talking to um, I love seeing you guys talking to michael in the comments

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.600
The half dome not a sphere. Okay. Okay

01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.240
Love course those book day after roswell. Yeah, I think that's just good reading

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:48.760
You know with take it with a skeptical approach just like anything, but I think day after roswell is um, excellent reading

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.840
excellent reading

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.840
continue to think others are

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:54.920
um

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:59.880
I don't I don't know about that. I I've only ever had two people that have used

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:06.280
My content, you know in the copyright tab of youtube and I they were just making like a compilation of different like testimonies and stuff

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.760
That's fine. That's fine

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.000
Jesse's interview with g han is such a banger. It's awesome. And I know he was teasing it for a while

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:16.920
I remember right before he dropped it that same day a lot of people on reddit were posting

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.560
What's happening with jessie's interview with with uh, dany protect jessie michaels. Yeah, jessie michaels is awesome

01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:26.680
The work he's doing is a sublime. It really is

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.920
um

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.520
Mr. T

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.520
discuss in scalar waves

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:37.800
Uh interact directly with the nucleus of an atom, which means they manipulate spacetime itself in very interesting

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:43.560
Ordle chow you and jessie collab set you turn me on to this channel mh go

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:45.240
um

01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:49.480
On jessie and I are discussing such things. We will see I will leave that to him to discuss

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:55.320
Eyes on cinema has a massive library of classic ufo contents and is always adding new videos. Yeah guys

01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:02.520
I always recommend uh keeping notifications on for eyes on cinema just for the content they post you absolutely can't find anywhere else

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.600
It's crazy

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:11.720
If you were to give a skeptic friend a one to three sentence summary about why the uap ufo alien phenomenon is probably real

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.680
good question

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.200
You

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.960
UFO sightings have occurred for centuries

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:28.760
The u.s. Government has downplayed and lied about these sightings in the robertson panel in conden report

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:32.280
Incredible whistleblowers have stated that

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.000
The u.s. Government and private contractors are in possession of these materials

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.360
Biggest emphasis on the second sentence. I don't need to think longer to get a better one. Sorry if this has been asked

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.720
What up debat debat debabs? What is your educational background?

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.360
I am not well spoken. I trip over my words all the time and blink all the dang time

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:56.120
But I am a mechanical and I have a bachelors of science and mechanical engineering. So that is my background

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.080
Is dan barish legit? I do not know I was going to cover him, but then um

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:05.560
I think it was the night shift posted some really long stuff on it

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:09.960
I haven't watched it, but I know that I think the guy's name is clint that does that channel

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:13.960
I know he takes his work seriously. So I bet he's got some good stuff on that

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:17.800
Um, I think he's probably he probably has a great stuff. I'll have to watch that

01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:24.280
Any thoughts on the physics implications of uap and the phenomenon so physics is uh, even though I'm an engineer

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:31.000
This this may seem silly. I'm uh dreadful at physics like maxwellian physics was really really hard for me, but

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.120
I mainly focus on the fact like um

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:40.040
It's really interesting how these these crafts sort of defy physics in terms of this in their instantaneous

01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:45.640
Acceleration deceleration trans medial ability. It almost seems like they're about they create a

01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.200
space-time bubble around them that can dampen inertia to do such things and not splatter

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:56.520
Whatever is in the craft in the craft themselves. So physics is the physics of the craft will lead that to kevin canuth

01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:03.320
Uh and his paper estimating flight characteristics of unidentified aerial phenomenon amazing paper highly recommend reading that

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.240
But I am not good

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:09.240
Interesting how the bitcoin expert predicted an uptick and disclosure activity once imminent dropped

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:12.600
This includes the quiet endorsement from the wilson. Interesting. I didn't know that

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:21.800
Thank you so much mr. Grover. I really appreciate that I wish you were jesse would solo or collab and amy escridge investigation

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:28.280
If I do my video on mysterious deaths around uap and individuals amy escridge will 100 be in there. Absolutely

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:36.680
Um, did you ever look into the am a reddit post about exo biospheric organisms from last year? Yeah, I did um

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.960
I can't recall too much, but I remember that well

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.440
Not well, but I remember that distinctly, but I need to um, I need to

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.360
Re-reference that if my name is requested in the hearing. I will testify and support from those I'm working with that'd be awesome to see

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.360
Michael testify awesome

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.160
There were claims that the nazis escaped in UFOs to Antarctica if I recall correctly

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.680
I don't know what to think about that. It's an interesting theory any theory about like a

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:04.840
The nazi super weapons de Glock and so forth is very interesting. I personally don't have enough

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.000
Confidence or confidence in any sort of research or backing to comment further

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.960
Chris melan pinned a couple of your episodes. What?

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.040
Chris melan released a signal exchange with somebody. I think he claimed was a high up a usg or

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.360
Intelligence communities for us and they were discussing the kingman crash. This was on twitter

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:30.120
I just responded with my video because I had just covered kingman briefly earlier and it got a lot of traction

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.680
So the nazi thing isn't true. I don't know

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.600
How do you yeah, Jordan? I see I've been done enough research. So I really don't have an opinion

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:43.960
How do you sort through the crap without chasing rabbit holes? That's a good question

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:51.240
Having a baseline of research and individuals to speak to when when I'm not quite sure about something or

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:59.240
Kind of just need to keep my head clear run some ideas by people, of course and euphology. There's so many rabbit holes and kind of

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:01.480
crap out there

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.520
and

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:08.520
Just kind of weighing the pros and cons of different people's testimonies and kind of just leaving footage behind I would say

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:16.360
Opinions on reptilians that she had mentioned. I think that John Ramirez has talked about that too cia former cia agent John Ramirez

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:23.240
Reptilians are a scary thought. I know I think this is very different than like the David Ike reptilian subject

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:29.480
That talks about reptilians being obama and other politicians, but like just a race of most reptilians

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:33.640
Beans and I you know, I must approach that with an open mind

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:39.080
We have robert sarbacher and vanavar bush commenting on insectoid like beans, which is very scary to me

01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:43.480
I'm going to look up that power. I highly recommend it. It's on the dpi archive

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:50.280
Just search powellek. I think it's there. It's it's just the full raw uncut footage. I really recommend it

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.080
I meant graze on dmt as far as I can tell they fast-tracked our evolution have been here longer than we have

01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.840
That is uh, that's interesting. That's like the the machine elves, right people describe what they see on dmt

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.280
Which are these

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.320
Strange entities. I think even alex jones has commented on that

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:07.320
Um

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:11.560
Anyone know what happened to the forechan whistleblower the document is pretty interesting now that we know a bit about more about

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:14.200
us. Oh, no idea what happened to the forechan whistleblower

01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:18.920
I I doubt when covering it. I'll be able to track down what happened to the dude, but I

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.800
Absolutely am going to to cover the case

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.440
Have you looked into the manipulation of the accepted historical record?

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.160
Is this the the theory of phantom time that about a 300 year period between like the

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.240
High middle ages like the 1700s or like the 14 to 1700 system exist and we're actually in the 1700s

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:41.800
I have I've never really looked into that, but I've always as a young as a young and I found that very interesting

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:44.280
I think the subject if I'm getting it correctly is phantom time

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.280
I meant to say I suspected there's an nh. I present the oceans for a while now. I left it. Okay. I got you. I got you

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:58.200
Nuclear power uap lore is the brainchild of dr. Knuth. Maybe I should talk to dr. Knuth

01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:00.200
I haven't spoken to him in a long time

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:04.280
John von Neumann also worked on the manhattan project. Yes, he did did someone

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.640
Uh

01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.640
Say Richard Dolan's wife is a sub

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:13.000
No, I think Richard Dolan's wife is a noted a remote viewer people were saying a noted remote viewer

01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:17.560
No, it's was great aliens talking. I'm used to extract DMT

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:22.360
Okay, so I think somebody said that this experience was just the DMT talking and you are talking about

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.920
Um actual beans you observed

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:31.320
Favorite bjj move any follow and whose lineage do you follow prefer sport or self-defense?

01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:36.280
Now that's a great question. I am from the hegan machado lineage under nobu yagai

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:40.280
I my favorite move. I like ripping twisters

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:45.080
I have been catching blue belts with twisters almost every day now and it brings me

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:51.800
Incredible joy to twister somebody you get the twister hook you either banana split them calf slice or them twister them or take the back

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:53.080
it's is

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.080
Just a very sublime experience

01:58:55.400 --> 01:59:00.840
and I I would say sport because I also train mixed martial arts and uh judo

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.440
And I have done some competing in jujitsu. So

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:13.320
Self-defense is more the Gracie combatives and that I'm a large man. So I'm not a lot of people would probably try and uh

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:18.200
Frankenstein choke me in the street. So mostly sports for me mostly sports

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.560
I hope you can carry john max torch really hope you are real one

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:26.920
I hope so too, man. One of my biggest passions besides crash retrieval is to speak to witnesses

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.920
That's one of the biggest things. I know a lot of people

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.240
Kind of feel uncomfortable doing that but I will go out of my way to try and speak to witnesses

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:36.920
That involves cold calling and we saw how that went with witness tb

01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:39.480
We saw how that went

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:43.400
Uh senior mechanical engineer for Cummins. Oh cool. My senior project in school was for Cummins

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:48.520
We went to the factory in indiana. We made a spark plug durability tester. The Cummins guys are really smart

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.520
very smart

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:53.560
I find the varginia case very compelling. I might relate it to other

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:59.080
Other cases and focus on more so the crash retrieval aspect because I know james fox already has a brilliant

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:00.840
excellent

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.000
piece on varginia in moment of contact

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:08.360
I think russia's talked about the ufo that is way bigger when entered in one of the leak conference

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:13.720
Yes, that was the wall street conference that occurred just after but the original article came out in I think june

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:19.000
But he re-referenced that at that wall street speech. He gave to like 60 people that somebody leaked out some photos. Yes

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:25.720
If you look up astral projections, some people report vaccine shadow people in that realm and sometimes they will hunt that sounds terrifying

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.800
That sounds extremely scary

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:31.800
Michael's story is extremely compelling. No doubt about that. I agree

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:35.720
I can probably put a good word for you in Cummins. I appreciate that

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:40.680
I I hope to I hope to be able to travel around full time for this someday speaking to um

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.640
speaking to uh witnesses and so forth

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.640
Opinions on reptilians same. I uh

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.640
Approach that with an open mind

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:55.240
I think there's probably a difference in the reptilians of david eich of the lizard people that are obama and hillary clinton

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.800
Versus a type of a reptilian-esque species. I know michael schratt has

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.440
Discussed this from the notes of lennard stringfield

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:09.080
But same thing if robert sarbacher and vanavar bush have commented on an insectoid almost mantis like bean. I gotta keep it open mind

02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.920
Love the iceberg series. Okay. Here's what i'm thinking guys

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.240
With lives, of course, we talked about some news today and we've had more fun

02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:24.360
What i'm thinking is if we do another iceberg we do it together in a live and we can um research as we go

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:30.360
I'd like to keep the channel focused on investigations crash retrievals discussing witnesses and interviews

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.280
If you guys like that and we'll find some time to do um

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.880
Some icebergs together. I think that'd be a heck of a lot of fun

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:42.120
Have you done any research on the horton brothers? I've never I have not

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:44.440
I have not and i'm gonna write that down

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.880
Thank you

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.160
Yes, j. Allen heineck was absolutely convinced there was something to uh do this

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.400
I love j. Allen heineck. He's very such an interesting person

02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.600
I've always found the fact that there were like 50 different radar recordings of the object going like five times

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:09.000
Fast than anything humans had in the 60s to be very compelling. Yeah, including a verner von bran's mentor herman osberth

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:14.200
A rocket scientist talking about upper bounds of ufo speed flying saucer speed being like

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
30 to 48 thousand miles per hour

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:19.400
Hackology, what's up, man?

02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:24.200
They're plasma powered. That's how they create clouds the clouds also camouflage. I have heard that as well

02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:27.640
It's sort of like an mhd plasma. I have heard that as well

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:29.960
um

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:36.520
Some craft are invisible to the naked eye as they affect gravity. Yes, that is one of the five observables from uh lulizondo low observability

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:42.600
Could you please uh link to the paper you mentioned? Yeah, sure. Let me throw that in the chat. Uh

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.960
Sorry

02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.240
That's so many flight characteristics of unidentified

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:56.040
Anomalous, all right. I've referenced this a few times from kevin canuth

02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:59.880
But there it is in the chat if you would like to like to watch

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:03.480
Okay, um

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:10.520
By the way, I know the people that wrote the post on amy eskridge that blew up on reddit and they deleted it the next day

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:13.480
Do you know why they deleted it the next day? That's that is interesting

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:17.800
It would make sense if they utilize some gravity creating tech. Yeah, I'm

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:22.760
Even bob lasar has said that back in the day. Uh, maybe we'll cover him someday. Maybe

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:31.000
Let's see. Um, sorry. I'm just uh, the paulic interview was crazy the implications of them trying to implant people on a massive scale

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.400
And the tech what they can do it is the paulic

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:39.320
Interview is very very consequential. I would highly recommend watching that guys highly recommend

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:44.440
Um, the the grays live underground so that would be similar to phil schneider's claims

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:51.480
Uh, michael says no problem. Have a good night. I'm off to work in a little bit. Keep up the support and keep tuning into kerb's channel

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:53.480
Yeah, guys michael

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.480
works his tail off I

02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.120
I've sometimes talked to him and it'll be like nine or ten at night and he's still at work

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:02.760
So michael is very hardworking

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.240
Will you start doing live streams going through ufo related info because I've seen some very interesting videos

02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.560
Documents and links to share with you. Yeah, absolutely

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:13.480
Maybe what we could do just because I like I'm not the news of the day type guy

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:17.640
I don't really care for um, like reaction type content. Maybe I know I've talked about this

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:20.280
But I'll actually do it like once a week we can just kind of round up some

02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:24.200
Some news of the day discuss stuff because just as much as I want to give my opinion

02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:28.200
I want to hear your guys's opinion. You guys keep me grounded in my research as well

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:34.760
Of course, just investigating solo can do some crazy things to your mind. So I do really appreciate every single comment you guys have

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.000
nuclear power would merely

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.040
Uh cover the energy output of the objects luminosity beyond that it has to be a completely different power source. Yes

02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.360
Uh, Richard Dolan's wife

02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:52.120
Uh is a lot more into the woo side and does remote viewing. They are interesting pair and complement each other well probably keeps them more balanced

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.760
I agree. I agree Dolan. Dolan is fantastic

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:59.880
I bet Davis was never under NDA about that memo. They were just pretending for whatever reason. I think yeah

02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:04.680
And I think it was also Edgar Mitchell now has it has been shown. He was under NDA

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:07.800
okay, um

02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:15.240
That's exactly how real ets appear these days as orbs lights meteors like objects are just staying the other dimension because they are targeted with

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:21.000
Scalar weapons when appeared in 3d the subject of scalar weapons in golden domes of she hand puts them to kind of

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.200
Tech cloaked uap and bring them down is very interesting like I would definitely cover that

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.760
Definitely cover that

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.080
Uh, do you do these every sunday? No, but I should it's been difficult to find the time

02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:37.000
But if sunday's a good time that works for everybody I would I would love to

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:41.880
Um, did your friends end up convincing you to try path of exile?

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:44.200
No, I haven't been able to play too many games

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:46.600
But what I have been playing is the black ops 6 beta

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:51.000
So if anybody wants to play some black ops 6 when it comes out, I know that's a very casual take

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.800
But reading so much. I need some games to just kind of melt my mind a little bit

02:05:55.800 --> 02:06:00.280
So if people want to play black ops when it comes out, let's do it. Let's do it live iceberg

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:05.240
Okay, next week. We are doing a good, uh, a nice live iceberg. Okay guys, I'll find a fresh one

02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:07.640
We'll go through it. We'll have some fun

02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:13.400
Um, I get a coffee about the it was post-grouchy and they pulled it because concerned about family members and digging in a little too

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:17.800
Yeah, the the the digging too deep can definitely be a concern or

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:21.000
violating possibly violating any sort of ops sec

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.240
operational security

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:27.560
Is not fun. How do you find the time to go through all this do research and then do videos?

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:29.480
um

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.480
The research stage is

02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:36.360
Um is like a is a true gift. I love doing research for stuff

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:41.240
Recording audio is another story and editing can be a slog

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.600
But doing the research time flies by I could sit for 10 hours a day pouring through documents

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.680
How do I find the time to do this?

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:52.680
Fortunately, I have a very nice girlfriend that understands that how much this means to me

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:57.480
Unfortunately, her dad is also huge into ufo. So she doesn't mind when I speak to to him about it

02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:00.440
Or she doesn't mind when he speaks to me about it. But uh,

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:05.880
I'd say the biggest thing is efficiency and that's having a database of documents which I always try and have

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.640
Have you ever seen the custodian file? Yeah, I have

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:14.040
They've been recording u.p. He calls dragons. Yes, I have and that's that's interesting

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:20.120
Again, I don't place uh too much on footage. Uh, just because there's so much footage out there and you can debate endlessly

02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.720
Uh, so I just kind of like to move on for

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.840
Move on a little bit from footage, uh

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:32.040
To me, maybe it's good to put in videos, but uh discussing it. It can just go around in circles

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:37.080
Palak. Yes, watch this on the dpr archive. It was lc who brought this up super interesting

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:40.600
He passed before the interview came out. This was in early 2000s

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.360
I believe at like a just a middle age too, which is tragic like 50 or 60. But yeah, um

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:49.560
So I I'd really recommend looking at palak

02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:55.560
I'd also recommend that you check out the study that was going on by the uh, tedesco brothers and donna nardo on long island

02:07:56.040 --> 02:08:03.000
Speaking of long island, that's a I can't wait to cover the 1992 long island ufo case near brookhaven national labs

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.560
So that's an interesting place

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.560
Who is my favorite ufo journalist?

02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.200
Leonard stringfield and ryan wood easily easily. Those are the two best

02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:16.280
magic eyes only and crash retrievals parts one through seven are

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:19.160
absolute works of art

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:21.640
absolute works of art

02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:30.520
Oh, okay searching palak implants puts uh, no so the google the google uh dpr archive the link system doesn't work

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:35.080
So if you join in the the discord, I will let me I'll post one more link

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:37.960
I will post that uh, once I get off once I get through these

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.520
Comments, I will post that

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:43.880
So I'll put the palak video

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:49.560
Um, thank you man. God bless you too. I love answering the questions. It's a lot of fun

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:52.840
Okay, everybody likes. Hey, have a good labor day too. I don't know how to say your name

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.320
I will just call you attack on titan demon

02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:59.480
But yeah sunday sunday is great. Everybody loves path of exile guys. Don't

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:03.640
Don't don't ruin my life. It's already tough enough to get to get videos out

02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:09.080
Just a tip. It's european 3m. Maybe do it earlier for more views. Uh, good. Yeah, I thank you for that

02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:13.640
I appreciate that. I know a couple people were saying they were in the uk and that it was a bit late

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:18.520
Mr. Harry, thank you very much guys. I'm gonna get through these and then we'll we'll call it a night my friends

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:24.200
Counter strike 1.6 my friend. Mr. T. W. Loves counter strike

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:28.280
Loves counter strike and he is trying to get me into it

02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:34.120
The horton brothers were a part of nazi germany and project paperclip, but they were taken by the russians. Okay, that is interesting

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.680
I would like to I would like to research that

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:43.800
Uh, Leonard stringfield is unmatched. Yes. Leonard stringfield is his work is just beautiful. It is beautiful

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:49.240
I hope one day I can go to his archive and in Cincinnati my hometown and and look into there

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:53.480
It's list on the eoc channel too. Oh the paulic videos on eoc. Cool

02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.640
The custodian file situation is basically the answer to all this the team at skinwalker ranch kept having dragons fly by in the

02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:03.800
Intense gravitational field would drain their battery. I think I have heard that about uh, kind of

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.400
Draining their batteries. I think I have

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.400
Have you ever read corso's original manuscript for the day after ross?

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:12.120
Well, it's pretty dry

02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:16.360
But it makes a lot more sense than the release book the publisher added a bunch of fluff to the book

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.040
I have that document downloaded

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:24.840
But I haven't actually read it because I didn't know there was a lot of fluff that was cut out

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:30.280
So is that his uh specific affidavit because I will read that that sounds awesome

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:34.040
Love from australia. Hey, thanks, man. As you can tell by the poster

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.160
I got a lot of respect for the Aussies a lot of respect

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:40.600
Almost someone with his eric mitchell overview would prefer to send

02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:45.960
Via discord dm. I will keep an eye out for the request once we hang up and I'll get all that stuff going

02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:50.600
And with that guys, I think tonight we will call it a night everybody who's been here

02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:54.200
Whether it be five minutes or the whole time we've been on for two hours and 10 minutes

02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.640
Thank you guys so much. Uh, it means the most seeing everybody commented. I love it

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.160
I don't know where I'd be without you guys. So we will plan for

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.040
Next sunday and right now we are in the research stage of a new video. I got like

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:13.080
I'd say five or six immediate videos coming out one of them

02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:16.520
If I can get this individual to

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:22.280
Speak would be a huge video. Uh, actually two people actually three

02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:25.880
There's three huge leads. I'm chasing down. I'm not going to spoil anything right now

02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:28.600
But I really hope I can cover these because they'll be awesome videos

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:34.520
And with that guys everybody have a wonderful night and I will catch you all later. Goodbye my friends

02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:37.720
and stream
