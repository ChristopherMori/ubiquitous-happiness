1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:38,000
All right. I think we're live. Let me see. Let's check on the phone.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What up, Martin? How you doing, man? We are live. Awesome.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What up, Brandon? How you doing, man? What are you guys up to?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm going to wait for some people to filter in,

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then I kind of wanted to touch on some of the new interests around the Wilson Davis document and the fat rodents Chaco Martin.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's up? Hey, guys. So, yeah, we'll just wait for a couple people to filter in.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We'll talk about the new Wilson Davis revelations because I also really want to touch on what Eric Davis said.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of that. And then the Ross Colt Hart AMA. I found it pretty interesting.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I kind of want to review two possible sources of that 2004 JSOC on program action.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's up, Bertie? I don't know if I've seen you in lives before. So what's going on?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
While we're gearing up, I do want to talk about if everybody can just keep Mr. Ryan Wood in their minds.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
As you guys probably learned about two days ago, Dr. Robert Wood has passed on.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know recently he suffered some sort of medical complications, and I know talking with Ryan, I think his father's passing came as somewhat of a surprise.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So if you can keep him in your mind, and if you guys can let me know if you've watched Dr. Robert Wood's video on the DPI,

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but in Stephen Greer's 2001 kind of video set, you can find it on SiriusDisclosure.com.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I highly recommend watching that as kind of Ryan touched on the video as a McDonnell Douglas aircraft rocket scientist.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Actually, this man was incredibly accomplished. He kind of talked to his superiors.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When are we going to figure out gravity manipulation technology before Lockheed Martin does?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And he was given a task, met up with Stanton Friedman, but was basically denied access.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So he was a big friend of Stanton Friedman. Let's go through some of these questions and so forth.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Bertie, yes, almost 10k. Hope so soon, man. That'd be awesome. I can't believe this. I started this channel out.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Maybe we'll talk about the origins of the channel a little bit. This is actually quite funny. Let me go through this.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Will O'Malley retain? Yes, he's going to knock Marabba out in the early rounds.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then if Taporio beats, I don't even want to hear it. This man still should be champ.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If Taporio beats Holloway, which I don't think he will, I'd like to see O'Malley knock out Taporio.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's up, Quitter? Bertie? Yes, sir. Hey, and Cody, thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But what's the most compelling evidence? Yeah, let's talk about that too.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Real fast about Mr. Robert Wood. Ryan, actually, when he and I met, because before we did our video online,

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
he and I actually had met up in person because he lives quite close to me in Colorado.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I shared a coffee talk for like three and a half hours. I'm so gracious for his time.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He has a lot of interest in kind of the gravity manipulation research that Ross Colthart has talked about stemming from the 50s and so on.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I hope to have Ryan back on about that sort of project.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's a really good article, and I believe the drive about the 50s gravity manipulation studies.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So I'll also link that. But what's the most compelling piece of evidence the MJ12 docs are real?

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I might say the surrounding the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman Forest Hall memo, the Cutler Twining memo,

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and Nathan Twining's White Hot Report. I think those are very interesting.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's so much good information around the Eisenhower briefing document.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to return to the Majestic 12 as well soon. I know you guys are familiar with Grant Cameron.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We'll talk about him in a little bit as we discuss the Wilson Davis memo.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In his files with UFO researcher Bill Moore, I've actually found some new Majestic documents I've never seen before, dated to the 80s.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So maybe in a little bit when I share my screen and we go through some stuff, we'll throw that up too, because this specific Majestic documents talks about EBEs.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, you know, I don't know if you guys back earlier this year, Grant Cameron released his files.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I highly recommend going through those. Maybe I can link them, including a big file set on the current project I'm working at, hoping to get out this week.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We do have the, you know what, now that you mentioned that, of course we have Ben Rich, but now we have Dr. Jim Ryder, as mentioned in imminent, and Lou Elizondo.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So Dr. Jim Ryder, I've actually been kind of looking into him a little bit behind the scenes with a couple of my friends.

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He was in the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center or Division, ATC Advanced Technology Center.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
On Lockheed's media stories, there are only ever two, there have only ever been two documents surrounding Dr. Jim Ryder.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
One of which was, one of which was a press release on some carbon nanotube material.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And another one was on, another one was on, sorry, I'm trying to remember.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center and a deal with DARPA to make a more substantial satellite network.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've been here, I know, Brady, you've been here since day one, man. I remember the first video I ever put out had the Wilson Davis video.

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We had like, I remember I was counting up the views on that every time I'd see one of the extra view and I'd get so happy.

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I am so sick of all these guys with the shady behind the scenes stories we need to hear and subpoena all these characters like Davis and put off, make them testify.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So all these rumors once and for all, I agree with that in terms of Eric Davis.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He seems to be very selective when he likes to weigh in about the phenomenon and so forth.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Eric Davis will stay quiet for a very extended period of time and then just come online to say that Lou Elizondo is fooey and something like that.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'd like to hear more about him and as we'll talk about in a little bit, it's interesting to hear him comment on the Wilson Davis memo.

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You know, even in his comment, there's some stuff that, you know, at least talking to James Rigney, the man who kind of brought the memo to Grant Cameron is a little inaccurate.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I would like to see Eric Davis subpoenaed.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Jimmy Shoe, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I really appreciate that.

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How do you think the Lockheed team killed the JSEC guys training or exotic equipment?

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, we will dive into that in just a little bit because as you know, I think a lot of this is getting connected with John Stewart and his supposed 2023.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think it was December 2023, but I have the files up. We'll go through it on the screen.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We'll actually go through the whole exchange that John Stewart posted.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But remember, remember this, remember Michael Herrera's insider submitted a document that was supposed to be a play on Dobser similar to secret machines by Tom DeLonge.

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This manuscript called Sentinels of Ether covers a blue on blue black program team killing JSEC members in 2004 in none other than Koyame, Mexico with conventional weaponry.

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So we'll talk about that.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So there was an experimental in the submarine in the fifties or sixties that used magnetic fields to operate and wasn't a classified project.

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I haven't heard of that T hammer. If you have a link, I would really, really like to go into that.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You like that, pal? I know you like that.

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
My lady got that for me. It's signed by Volk and everything. So that was a true treat to get and this is going to be the centerpiece.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have a couple of other things to hang up. I got a Joey made me a custom printed logo. I need to get that up and have another Bob reactor drawing.

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And of course, I have the framed Michael drawing. I got to get up Michael Herrera's when he drew the ARV.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I need to get get that up.

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Will you ever do a video? Yeah, absolutely. I read the 4chan whistleblower a lot.

79
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Any of you guys who aren't familiar with that, the crux of his argument or testimony is that deep underwater, there is a basically purpose built UAP production craft hamburger shaped.

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I believe it is. It's enormous.

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And apparently this builds UAP to spec and part of the reason that UAP is crash, according to this man's testimony is this this custom specking machine doesn't really care what happens to the to the craft.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So yeah, I actually really want to go through that line by line by line because there's so much interesting stuff there.

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Everything from talking about orbs and how he says the underlying structure behind these orbs people see is almost like a like a hammer shape, right?

84
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you if you've read that to the underground basis, he touches on implants.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And of course, implants are kind of the big ticket item now with Lou commenting on them.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then speaking of Lou, what are you guys thinking of imminent?

87
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I still haven't read it yet, if I'm being honest, I got a lot of other projects I'm working on.

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I do hope to talk to Lou soon.

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So if that's the case, you guys, my community, let's bump heads and let's figure out how to talk to him different than all of these from his Joe Rogan appearance to his all of his other appearances just talking about imminent

90
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and kind of the atyp all that stuff.

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I would like to dig into the origins of that a little bit more if I talked to him.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I would also like to talk more about crash retrievals and so forth.

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course, in imminent, he talks about the December 6, I mean, December 1950 crash retrieval near El Indio Guerrera near Del Rio, Texas.

94
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Those of you will know that that is only mentioned in the Eisenhower briefing document.

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So that could be a huge validating piece of the majestic documents to find out a little bit more about that case.

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So signed by Volk. Yes, it is. And bought by your lady. Yes, it is.

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We are a Volkanovsky household. She knows that whenever it's time for Volk to fight that I'll need complete silence because if he loses, which he hasn't because anytime he's lost, it's been CGI.

98
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll have a mental breakdown.

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So Snapple, how did you, how did I not find your channel before?

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Insanely, I appreciate that. I really appreciate that.

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We're still early, man. We're still just starting up.

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think first video was in mid to late January and that was on the Wilson Davis memo, which is very timely.

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you've watched that video, I think I was extremely ill when I made it, had a nasty cold and was working on a like $10 Amazon mic.

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So it sounds horrendous. I don't think there's any music or real production value.

105
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't think I showed my face in that.

106
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So, you know, maybe at a year, we'll revisit that topic and get a, get a bigger type of analysis on the Wilson Davis need to dive more into Lou's relationship with Bigelow.

107
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes. And Bigelow's plan to receive materials given from Lockheed Martin as highlighted in Kona Blue.

108
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So I think that's a great one. If any of you guys have questions, so I'm not saying anything set in stone, but if I get to talk to Lou, if you guys have questions that

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
branch out a little bit from his regular media appearances, let me know and I'll kind of factor that in.

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Again, if you weren't here yet, I do plan to talk more about crash retrievals.

111
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I sent you a Gmail. Are you possibly, I'm super behind on my emails. I'm sorry, guys. I have so many to go through and I try to respond to each one very thoughtfully.

112
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So if I haven't read your email yet, I promise I'm getting through the list. I'm so sorry.

113
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I know a lot of other productions have like a team or moderators. It's just me on this and that's kind of how I liked it.

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want to make sure I interface and speak to everybody here what they have to say. So if I'm behind, I'm very sorry, guys.

115
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Big dog. Hey, Lou, did MJ12? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to ask him straight up.

116
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I know Lou likes to answer questions he can't talk about in a bit of a roundabout way.

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't really kind of confirm or deny anything or even give the classic intelligence line like I can't comment on that.

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So I would like to figure some good ways to structure subjects such as that.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A Volk poster. Your girl have a sister.

120
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Spectre you the man. Thank you very much.

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Volk should have been double champ. Pride rules.

122
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't get me started on that. Let's see the difference between Volk and Islam in the fifth round and the second fight with CGI.

123
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is there any known case of a UAP crash in 2004? I know that I know there is the Tic Tac case, but that's not a crash.

124
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That is a good question. And like we'll talk about we have two origins and two kind of stories surrounding the 2004 JSOC team.

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In John Stewart's source, they talk about a crash retrieval in the Sentinels of Ether story. It talks about trafficking humans.

126
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I'm not quite sure. But I again, I'd like to pay attention to the Sentinels of Ether because remember that location in which this event takes place.

127
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Kuyama, Mexico. And we have covered a case with a story of a team that a Mexican national military team that died trying to transport the vehicle.

128
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It does. I hope I've answered. Yes, I have answered your priority. I'm very sorry if I'm slow on them.

129
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So Pina Davis put off Elizondo Sheehan, Nell Mellon. I think Nell is one of the most interesting people to talk to about this topic.

130
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have myself, I've spoken to Chris Mellon a few times. I tried to invite him on for an interview. He had to decline for the moment.

131
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hopefully we can get that in the future. I would really like to hear more from Chris Mellon.

132
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So do you have any comment on Hans Kamler? He was in charge of the Nazi secret weapon and only was recently revealed, was taken into custody after US custody.

133
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, where did, hold on, where did I hear that? I was talking to somebody. Yes, I was talking to somebody about this in terms of.

134
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, I was talking to a friend about this, that there are some documents stating that Kamler was actually alive.

135
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think this relates to a supposed Nazi base that was explored post-World War II near the Czech Republic that was revisited about 40 years later.

136
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I have to check my notes on that, but that is ringing a bell.

137
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Andrea, I love your videos. I've got my mom on to them. Thank you. I hope your mom enjoys them.

138
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Structure question. Lou, if someone kept D, I don't know, any alleged recoveries during his tenure with ATIP?

139
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, that's actually a great question. The only one I can really think of is the 2008 Needles, California crash.

140
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And that would of course be right at the time he has joined ATIP. That is a case that was covered by George Knapp.

141
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I would like to cover that in the future. There's not a ton around that case, but I know George Knapp in his reporting commented on some really interesting kind of military presence around that time.

142
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Again, if you haven't heard of that case, it's Needles, California 2008, and I will cover that.

143
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Toby Milo, thank you so much. Would love to see a collab with you and Lou or you and Ross.

144
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Love to see Michael back. Tim Gallaudet likes your stuff. Have him on. Ross is still that dude. I'll tell you that much.

145
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I've reached out to Timothy Gallaudet. He is not doing interviews at the moment, maybe in the future. I'd like to have Lou on.

146
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'd love to talk to Ross. And with Michael, I'm still investigating his case.

147
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So if there's new stuff to cover, of course, I'd love to talk to Michael again.

148
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Mrs. Floyd, thank you so much. I really appreciate that.

149
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And if young Hannah is watching, tell her I say hi.

150
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
MJ12, reworded question. If someone wants to keep digging on MJ12, would they eventually hit pay dirt one way or another?

151
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Good way to put it. I like that. I like that. All right. Peps per-speak cautious.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can't. You guys know I can't speak.

153
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Did you hear anything from the insider who manages multiple use up facilities about using PLFs and psychotronics to fake alien abductions and blame them on ETs?

154
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, no, I did not. But however, referencing the Stephen Greer DPI archive, there is witness.

155
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's see if I can get this out of my head. 10892.

156
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
10892 that talks about being on a retrieval team at Nellis observing a sunflower shaped NHI craft that had landed

157
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and also fake PLF. If you guys don't know what a PLF is, that's a programmable life form.

158
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This person in the DPI archive number 10892 alleges that after his time on a retrieval team, he encountered a programmable life form in a fake abduction.

159
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I have all of those files downloaded because we know Stephen Greer in OPSEC, so I don't know if those operational security, I don't know if those files are going to be taken down.

160
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But so I would like to dive into that case and give it its due diligence.

161
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The documents came out in 2021 that show Hans Kemler was taken into custody.

162
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The OSS agent who took him into US custody said to his son, Kemler had knowledge of weapons that influenced the Cold War in future.

163
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes, and that was the correct me if I'm wrong.

164
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And if you're on this subject, that was the location in the Czech Republic where the Nazis supposedly stored some art precious cardio and possibly weaponry.

165
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, I do a video on the UAP DA closer to December.

166
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, I probably should at this point seen as I reference it almost every video, especially the line about legacy programs, the 1954 Atomic Energy Act and classifying UAP materials as trans classified for nuclear materials.

167
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So I would like to do that.

168
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Is the control group headed from NATO outside US?

169
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's a good question. There is a lot of there's a lot of interesting

170
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
roots to go down to say that the control group handling the UAP issue issue isn't necessarily tied to one nation.

171
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you remember back to 2023, we have Canadian politician Larry McGuire, who wrote to the Canadian Defense Minister requesting to sort of start to divulge UAP information due to the collaboration effort between five eyes nation on the UAP issue.

172
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So we at least know outside of NATO, there's sort of a five eyes effort to study UAP, whether the program, whether that means the program, it extends to all five nations or primarily operated on the United States for quasi national.

173
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm not quite sure, but that's a great, great question.

174
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Did you see Eric Davis admitted on Facebook? Yeah, we're about to talk about that.

175
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Mr. Ben, I cannot wait.

176
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's very, very excited.

177
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The Wilson Davis memo was my first ever video, so I'm happy to revisit it.

178
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Who blazing? I don't know, man, I wouldn't be able to speak if I was blazing.

179
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Max Parr, thank you so much.

180
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're one of the best researchers out there.

181
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So happy you spend hours you do dedicated to this.

182
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What's your opinion on and you are own national underwater reconnaissance office BTW.

183
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So thank you, Max.

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I really appreciate it.

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The kind of USO underwater naval aspect of the phenomenon is something I am going down deep rabbit holes to research.

186
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If you watch my off world technologies division, I have studied a specific naval center.

187
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't really want to talk about and other naval centers that put to mind that sort of the Navy has a massive vested interest in UAP technology exploitation program.

188
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Or the study of USO.

189
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Earlier in my research, I would solely really only focus on the Air Force and mostly Air Force projects.

190
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Of course, the Air Force paper trail and UAP is so simple to find.

191
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You can just go back to the 50s and look at USAF regulation 200-2.

192
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You can look at any sort of USAF response to any sort of UAP discussion.

193
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But I'm really starting to take a harder look at the Navy.

194
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So with the Navy comes analysis of any sort of underwater reconnaissance office.

195
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Any sort of alleged underwater bases as well.

196
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I was actually talking to Ryan Wood about this.

197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
In his research, he has come across two really interesting spots underwater.

198
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
One off the coast of Florida and one off of Catalina Island in California.

199
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So as we move further with this channel, I know I've done the two USO videos.

200
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I really want to dive into more about kind of the Navy and any sort of underwater effort in relation to the phenomenon and USO in particular.

201
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What do you think of the Phil Schneider story?

202
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I haven't.

203
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And thanks again, Max Parr.

204
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I really appreciate that.

205
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Guys, Max Parr is a good friend of mine.

206
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I really appreciate everything he does.

207
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He's a great dude.

208
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What do you think about the Phil Schneider story?

209
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I haven't paid.

210
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I haven't done it.

211
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's due diligence.

212
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What I do know is that Phil Schneider claimed to have experienced a firefight in underground tunnels with NHI.

213
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I think fellow soldiers he was with were turned into some sort of goop or just faced horrific weaponry.

214
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I know he also had a very mysterious death.

215
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Now, that is the extent I know a Phil Schneider.

216
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I would like to look at him someday, you know, maybe he'd be a candidate for a UFO whistler's blur video.

217
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm not sure yet.

218
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I always admit when I don't know something that right now my knowledge on Phil Schneider is not great.

219
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Interview with Danny Sheehan might be fruitful.

220
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I would love that.

221
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't know if I could talk my friend Jesse Michaels though.

222
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He put out that interview with Sheehan and that's the best.

223
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Now, there is a good chance that very soon Mr. Michaels and I will be together.

224
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So I'd love to maybe just have a discussion with him.

225
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Maybe record it.

226
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And maybe we could talk to Jesse about his experience with Sheehan.

227
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I think that'd be great.

228
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What does Brady say?

229
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Anyone who has checked out the old interviews on Greer's channel, it's really missing out.

230
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I 100% agree.

231
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Anybody who's listening right now, please go to...

232
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No, I got the website wrong earlier.

233
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Go to DrStevenGreer.com.

234
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Up in the banner there's a link to witness testimony.

235
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There you can find everything from Philip Corso to Robert Wood to...

236
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I think you can even find like Carl Wolfe there and so forth.

237
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can find a ton of interesting interviews.

238
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Programmed life forms.

239
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They are clones using real ET DNA from down to UFOs.

240
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
They clone the beans and put some advanced tech in their brains to control them.

241
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That is an avenue I'd really like to explore.

242
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If you have some documents or just kind of research avenues on PLFs, please send them to me.

243
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
UAPGrever.com.

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'll be better about the emails.

245
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'd really like to learn more, especially as I look into witness 10.

246
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
10, 8, 9, 2.

247
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And again, if you want to look at a witness who spoke to Greer about PLFs, 10, 8, 9, 2.

248
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Jim Shoe, I love you too.

249
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I just got done with a skinny bob, an alien deep dive.

250
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you believe either of those are legitimate?

251
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I have not done the due diligence into either video.

252
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I know that the alien interview is kind of Jon Stewart's jam.

253
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll let him do his thing.

254
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I got to...

255
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think he's got an interview coming out in December.

256
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So I'll reserve judgment for then.

257
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The skinny bob, I know that's floated around.

258
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I know it's such a contentious thing, but correct me if I'm wrong.

259
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think some people are inferring that Ross Colthart alluded to skinny bob being a...

260
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
maybe skinny bob or other footage in the public domain being legitimate.

261
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So correct me if I'm wrong.

262
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Hans Kamler must have had knowledge about the Magenta 1933 and maybe Germans moved it to Skoda Works.

263
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Okay, yeah, and this might be Skoda Works I'm thinking of.

264
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Speaking of the 1933 crash, I know two guys that are excellent and have so much knowledge on the 33.

265
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So if you guys want to see a revisit of that, this guy has so many connections to Alan Dolos and so forth.

266
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'd love to revisit that.

267
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Do you think Eric Davis would testify?

268
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't know.

269
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Maybe he has behind closed doors, but I really don't know.

270
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I really don't know.

271
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay, let's see.

272
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's see.

273
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The Wilson Davis is huge confirmation of the fact that Steven Greer...

274
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes, thank you.

275
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I know people have been talking about that lately.

276
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is a confirmation that Steven Greer in 1997 did brief Admiral Thomas Wilson,

277
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
a deputy director of the DIA and other politicians on what we can assume is the disclosure briefing document from 2001.

278
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If you guys haven't read that, I'll flash it on screen in just a minute and we can talk about that as well.

279
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's been said that every deep water deployment that has a nuclear payload has some type of UAP encounter,

280
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
every single deployment.

281
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That brings to mind Lou speaking recently of the...

282
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What was it?

283
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Hawk missile?

284
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
No, I can't remember what type of missile, but in a retrieval recovery to find the cassette for the missile telemetry data,

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
a massive UAP rising from the surface and essentially taking the missile.

286
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So that's interesting.

287
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You know what case that stuck with me when I covered USO?

288
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It was the case of the...

289
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think it was a Tic-Tac in 1950 recorded in Blue Book.

290
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That was like a Tic-Tac or Ovoid shape.

291
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't think quite Tic-Tac.

292
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That was just hovering above the surface almost turning the water.

293
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That was almost like vibrating very fast.

294
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
For some reason, that particular USO case has really stuck in my head.

295
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Phil Schneider was very sketchy.

296
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
His death was very sketchy.

297
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We got to look into that, guys.

298
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I think one time I want to make a video just talking about suspicious deaths of UAP adjacent individuals,

299
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
whether that be researchers or whistleblowers.

300
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What comes to mind is James E. McDonald as a primary person I want to talk about.

301
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Two cents.

302
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Thank you very much.

303
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Criminally underserved curves, one of the few genuine nuts and bolts reporters out there.

304
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I really appreciate that.

305
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Super thanks from Miss Hannah Floyd.

306
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Thank you very much.

307
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
For those who don't know, this is my lovely girlfriend, C.H.

308
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
When is the program coming out?

309
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Hopefully soon.

310
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I know Jesse Michaels has actually watched the program.

311
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I think that Robert Hastings has as well.

312
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Robert Hastings wrote UFOs and nukes.

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Hopefully soon.

314
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I know James Fox has just had another kind of investor on the program.

315
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I am beside myself excited to see that.

316
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I really want to watch.

317
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
All right, Max Barr.

318
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Isn't it fascinating?

319
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I wonder what underwater assets we're going to be considered for ATIPS Project Interloper.

320
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes, for anybody who doesn't know, Project Interloper is Lou referring to kind of entraping UAP with kind of large nuclear signatures.

321
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
October, November, according to UFO Twitter.

322
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay, let's see.

323
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
P. Is this hobby just our way of making the world more exciting after decades of this and an entire planet that could present evidence?

324
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
There is still nothing but stories and debunked videos.

325
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No, I do disagree with that.

326
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
At this point, at least to me in my research, I don't really factor videos and I know I've covered two videos in the past, but I'm moving away from that.

327
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think that endless debate is going to circulate around videos.

328
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But I do think even the conversation is expanding so much with Lou Azzando, David Grush, but there is a massive, massive, massive, provable trail of a UFO cover-up, an interest in UFO from USG and other military sources from at least the 1930s for factoring in Magenta.

329
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The difficulty here and why we're stuck with so many stories is disinformation around this subject has been so complete and successful, it is so difficult to unwind this entire topic.

330
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
This brings to mind stuff like OPNAV 3820 Air Force Regulation 200-2, which would restrict UFO reporting to certain channels to skirt the balance of Blue Book.

331
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This brings to mind J.L. and Heineck in Blue Book, which would discuss away UAP cases as nothing more than swamp gas or weather balloons.

332
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The famous case there, of course, is the 1955 case where many people in Michigan saw craft that J.L. and Heineck famously said was swamp gas that even at the time Senator Gerald Ford took an interest in.

333
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And all of this extends even towards the modern day with Arrow, right?

334
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We have the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1, which demonstrably lies about some of the witnesses there.

335
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
For example, Michael Herrera, it discusses Michael Herrera seeing an extraterrestrial craft in American block ops team.

336
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So even today in 2024, there are official lies by USG elements about the phenomenon and about this topic.

337
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So there is a map and let's not forget the Robertson panel, the Condon Report.

338
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Remember in the Condon Report by Edward Condon out of CU Boulder, which states there's nothing to UFOs, there's nothing there.

339
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:25,000
There are multiple cases in there such as a 1955 case from an RB-47 jet, which multiple jets in formation saw, I think, a disc shaped UFO.

340
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It was caught on visual and radar and so forth performing insane maneuvers.

341
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And the Condon Report takes a sighting such as this as whatever, it's nothing.

342
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So there's a very provable cover up here for 80 years.

343
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What it is, this is what this is our purpose here.

344
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And we can even look at Roswell.

345
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Remember Roswell case closed the US Air Force debunk on Roswell.

346
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It didn't show up until 1994.

347
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Roswell occurred in 1947.

348
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,000
In that 1994, the US Air Force labeled the Roswell Weather Balloon Project Mogul Flight 4, which was then proven to not have even taken off on the day it was said to have taken off.

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I think Roswell explained the bodies away as dummies, which weren't introduced into official USAF service into the 50s.

350
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So there's so much sketchiness around this topic.

351
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I could ramble on forever, forever.

352
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Big dog, miss talking with you and Max, get back in.

353
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let's chat with Max.

354
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So what do you think about Eric Mitchell, who Dr. Michael Masters had a very intensive, I don't think I might not be familiar with Eric Mitchell.

355
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Please enlighten me.

356
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Pete's best.

357
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Thank you very much.

358
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
UFOs and NATO Richard Hall interview was first hand witnesses of finance and your team.

359
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Have you seen it many leads?

360
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
When is the Marshaise video dropping?

361
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I have not seen that Richard Hall video, but I'm going to right now.

362
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Full transparency.

363
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I got two projects I'm working on right now.

364
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
One of them is the good old Kecksburg 1965 crash retrieval case, which is a fantastic case.

365
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I can wait to talk about it.

366
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm trying some fresh research avenues on that case.

367
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Some things that haven't really been explored too much that have been in other kind of researchers files.

368
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay.

369
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Trollmama, what can we do to support you?

370
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Just further the UAP discussion.

371
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That's it.

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Continue to talk about UAP.

373
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Inform your friends who think that this is just a conspiracy and lump in the UAP phenomenon with Bigfoot, ghosts, ghouls, guests, demons.

374
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Explain.

375
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Explain the facts behind UAP.

376
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That's kind of why I started this channel.

377
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Talking about everything from Robertson panel to the creation of Blue Book sign grudge, the players in the 40s and 50s and so forth, early signings, Blue Book signings, USO signings and so forth.

378
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Take a couple of hours to answer.

379
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, that's a good idea.

380
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll do that this week.

381
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Absolutely.

382
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
When I interview Dr. Stephen Greer, I absolutely would interview Dr. Stephen Greer.

383
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That would be very controversial, but that is somebody who I would like to speak to.

384
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Absolutely.

385
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Again, we have our opinions.

386
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Everybody has their opinion on Dr. Stephen Greer.

387
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I still will not downplay some of his previous efforts in the world of UAP.

388
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Absolutely.

389
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Big dog, thank you so much.

390
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I really appreciate it.

391
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Let me get through these and then let's touch on the Wilson Davis memo.

392
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Correct.

393
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Was that UFO and ET UFO or man made ARB?

394
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If you're talking about the Michael Herrera in the Aero Historical Report Volume 1, from

395
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
time number one, he thought that was a man made vehicle.

396
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
James Forestall getting thrown off the building.

397
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yep.

398
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I think Ryan would have some good stuff to speak about too on that.

399
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Of course, Dr. Mack as well died in a, I think like a really sudden drunk driving accident.

400
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Dolan, I think Dolan has a book coming out about USOs and I would really like to talk

401
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
to him about that too.

402
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Dolan's just fantastic.

403
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Dolan's one of the best of the best guys.

404
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I really look up to him.

405
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What have I missed?

406
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Nothing yet.

407
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We're just answering questions right now.

408
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Everyone's asking great questions though.

409
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's why we get through this.

410
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Can you ask Lou about the tripping photos?

411
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

412
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Actually, that's great.

413
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

414
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Absolutely.

415
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What's up, David?

416
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Have I?

417
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No, I have not.

418
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I think the people I want to talk to right away, just researchers, Grant Cameron, Richard

419
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Dolan and a huge one, Michael Schrat.

420
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'd love to talk to these guys.

421
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There's plenty of other researchers I'm in contact with, but I'd love to sit down and

422
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
have a conversation with them.

423
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So because Libby, I was kind of baiting a Facebook post the other day about UAP USO and the only

424
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
people to respond like it besides Rando 30s was my active Navy friend from high school.

425
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Interesting.

426
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It seems on Reddit and other platforms we're starting to get a lot of Navy personnel talking

427
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
about sightings.

428
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I think there was on Reddit about a Navy cook the other day who talked about his USO sightings.

429
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I can't really remember it.

430
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I only glossed over it, but he saw something rising out of the water.

431
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What do I think about the Nazca mummies?

432
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The Nazca mummies are very interesting.

433
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I will be interested to see further research on them.

434
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I know there's a website.

435
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I can't remember what it's called, but you can actually view the 3D scans of the mummies,

436
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
including the one that supposedly has a fetus inside.

437
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I know there was some claims that a lot of these mummies were like a goat head or something

438
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
or animal parts stitched together, but I think there's been some research to kind of downplay

439
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
that.

440
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Again, I'll need to get a better understanding, so I'll continue.

441
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I saw a video about a PhD building a nuclear honeypot to draw in UAP.

442
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yep, Mr. Interloper.

443
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay.

444
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Please send your thoughts and prayers to UFO researcher Nicole Sackatch and Courtney.

445
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

446
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I know I've actually spoken to Courtney.

447
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Courtney is wonderful, and I have heard that she has faced intimidation and threats for

448
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
some of the stuff she's done.

449
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So yeah, I have heard of that.

450
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So yes, keep her in your thoughts.

451
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Then thank you so much.

452
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I appreciate that.

453
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That means the most to me.

454
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I really, really, really appreciate that.

455
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Mr. Harry, cute dog.

456
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What do you think about the Greer files?

457
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What do you do with the Greer files?

458
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Like or not, you went for the date.

459
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The Greer files are not done.

460
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There's a lot.

461
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Actually, there's a lot more I'm going to cover from the Greer files.

462
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Everybody knows UFOs are real.

463
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That's not the debate now.

464
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Who's piloting them?

465
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes, I agree.

466
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Who's piloting them and who has them?

467
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'll write directly, Dr. Eric.

468
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

469
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm writing down Eric Mitchell, sir.

470
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Thank you.

471
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Let's see.

472
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Which is a question that has been answered decades ago by Greer and other people like

473
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Ben Rich confirmed that UFOs are of two types, ET and manmade UFOs or alien reproduction

474
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
vehicles.

475
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I have started to move forward tremendously in my outlook towards the possibility of ARVs

476
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and manmade vehicles derived from extraterrestrial tech or just non-human tech in general.

477
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I am starting to really agree with that picture.

478
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Sorry.

479
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Let me get through these.

480
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
David, Dr. Banevard Bush, the little I've read on him shows no science-fontological shock.

481
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He seemed to have pushed out of government work by 1950.

482
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
If he was the head of MJ-12, it wasn't for long.

483
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, quite possibly, but remember from the Bowen manuscript, this was in 1962.

484
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That was sent to the DOD for review from author Bowen.

485
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That was returned in 1962 with handwritten notes from Banevard.

486
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
He was still fluttering around there.

487
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Mark Streik.

488
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
People still can't decide whether NHIs are ET-dimensional.

489
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, I agree.

490
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's very divided.

491
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Of course, that's probably a conversation that's going to continue to tumble around for a long

492
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
time.

493
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm talking about everyone.

494
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Is it ET or ARVs?

495
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yes.

496
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We can start to build a database of flight characteristics and craft.

497
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Maybe we can find a demonstrable difference in kind of acceleration mechanisms, sound

498
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
output of craft, and so forth.

499
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Zach, what's up, dude?

500
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I've ever listened to Ray Bosch.

501
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
He's a pastor who the Collins Elite talked to.

502
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
No, I haven't.

503
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I was talking about the Collins Elite with somebody today.

504
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm absolutely going to chase that down.

505
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
For anybody who doesn't know what the Collins Elite is, this was referenced by kind of Lou

506
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Elizondo and some of that other crew who talk about some people within the USG who are basically

507
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
terrified to investigate this phenomenon because they think it's demonic.

508
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'd love to kind of really understand the thought process there.

509
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'd really like to go down that rabbit hole.

510
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Shrat is a hero.

511
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He knows about the man-made UFOs.

512
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Shrat is excellent.

513
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
If you guys don't know Michael Shrat, he's a CAD designer.

514
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
He's worked with so many witnesses to kind of recreate images of their encounters.

515
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And he has covered a lot of cases that deal with UAP that I've sometimes even utilized a human pilot.

516
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Jangi Squint.

517
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh, dude, your profile picture is nasty.

518
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But thank you very much.

519
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I really appreciate that.

520
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The Ivan 0135 videos.

521
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I think this is skinny Bob, right?

522
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I was asking if anybody can tell me with kind of further confidence if this was...

523
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ross Colthart was alluding to this video.

524
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Who is this Dolan guy?

525
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Richard Dolan.

526
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Please go to his channel and look at some of his books.

527
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
He's fantastic.

528
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Richard Dolan is one of the best UFO researchers out there.

529
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Do you know when the program Insiders Book Sentinels of Ether will be published in full?

530
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I do not, but I have asked the same questions because I would like to read more.

531
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Have I looked further into Draper, Gaither, and Anderson and their connections to the SAGE program, MIT Rad Lab?

532
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Max Barr?

533
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
No, I haven't.

534
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And I know when Max Barr drops a line of inquiry, guys, you listen.

535
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So no, I'm writing that down, man.

536
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I really appreciate that.

537
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I actually have no idea.

538
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So that's fantastic.

539
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I appreciate that.

540
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Radle, holy crap.

541
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Thank you, Radle.

542
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Thank you so much.

543
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I really appreciate that, especially the Volk poster looking out.

544
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's incredible.

545
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Thank you so much.

546
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Thank you.

547
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's the best.

548
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What do you make of Lou Elizondo's claims regarding excision of a technological device and implant from a U.S.

549
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
servicemen who experienced a UAP event?

550
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I think that the implant has been a territory I have been a little afraid to go down.

551
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Of course, there's just that and what's it called?

552
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Abductions or they can just be so hairy.

553
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What I need to do here is now return to the sort of Dr. Lear and his kind of extensive work on supposed implant removal.

554
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So once I kind of looked on that, I'll have a way better kind of understanding of this.

555
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But I found it fascinating Lou would talk about that with Ross, especially the implant.

556
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You are really cool and doesn't afraid of anything.

557
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Thank you, Peter.

558
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I appreciate that.

559
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm afraid of a lot.

560
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Black Ops guys showed up at my house and threatened me not to talk about this again.

561
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'd be pretty dang scared.

562
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But thank you.

563
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
YouTube.com slash Richard M. Dolan.

564
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I highly recommend checking him out.

565
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Would you recommend interview Nick Redfern?

566
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

567
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Nick Redfern is always really interesting.

568
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
If you guys listen to the podcast Mysterious Universe, he is always referenced on there too.

569
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So absolutely.

570
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yep.

571
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Dr. Lear has some awesome work on implants and that is going to be the next source.

572
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay.

573
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Shall we discuss the kind of Wilson Davis stuff now?

574
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me figure out how to share my screen guys.

575
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Present share screen share screen.

576
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Let me window entire screens.

577
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I've never done this before guys.

578
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm still a bit of a novice share.

579
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay.

580
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So here we have from the other day.

581
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This was from a private Facebook group that Eric Davis is in.

582
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And I believe since then, of course, I haven't been able to confirm this.

583
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But I think since then he has left this Facebook group because as far as I know,

584
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
this was supposed to be a private endeavor that was leaked.

585
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But Eric Davis, if you don't know, let's start with an introduction to the Wilson Davis memo.

586
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
How about that?

587
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Because I know anybody watching this channel probably knows what the Wilson Davis memo is.

588
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Let me just pull up the file.

589
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We'll just do like a quick 15 second, probably like two minutes actually.

590
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
We'll just go through the memo real fast.

591
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The Wilson Davis, sorry, I have so many files.

592
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Wilson Davis, Eric Davis meeting with Admiral Wilson.

593
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Okay.

594
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Good.

595
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

596
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So the Wilson Davis meeting recounts a meeting with Eric Davis and rear Admiral Thomas Wilson.

597
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The parking lot of EGNG in Las Vegas in 2002.

598
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And these, of course, are the meeting notes.

599
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,000
This is following a briefing from Dr. Steven Greer in 1997 that he gave to select members of Congress and other individuals.

600
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So one of these being Steven Lovekin.

601
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If you guys remember the person I covered who talked about a, I really hope so.

602
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I truly hope so.

603
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And maybe because mom's from discussed and other world technologies division.

604
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But anyways, back to the Wilson Davis memo.

605
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
If you guys, I recommend watching my video on the Wilson Davis memo and maybe a slog to get through.

606
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm sorry.

607
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's not my most exciting work.

608
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I will revisit it.

610
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But if we look through this memo, it recounts meeting notes.

611
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And this is apparently about Admiral Thomas Wilson investigating the UFO program after being inspired by his discussion with Steven Greer,

612
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Luke Shan and others.

613
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And he is Stonewald.

614
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Apparently this program was embedded within special access programs, multi tiered.

615
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What is really interesting for me to look into now that this memo has almost been confirmed by Wilson or Eric Davis is the discussion of the project keepers.

616
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Of course, this is Commander Will Miller.

617
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I've talked about him quite a bit.

618
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Commander Will Miller.

619
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Let me just find the exact line about the keepers.

620
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Because there's just so much.

621
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I don't want to make this a full Wilson Davis video.

622
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But I really recommend kind of watching my video on it because we kind of go through a to Z of the Wilson Davis memo.

623
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But yes, okay.

624
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And the keepers of the program, I forget what they're called.

625
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm trying to think, but one of these, the watch committee, that's it.

626
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Comprising the watch committee is a security director and I say retired CI expert, a program director and a corporate attorney.

627
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And these are the people Admiral Wilson met with and was kind of Stonewald from looking more into the looking more into the project.

628
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So the program manager directly said that the uap program doesn't fit into any weapons program Intel program spec ops or logistics program.

629
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It was a reverse engineering program something recovered years ago in the past.

630
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Is this magenta?

631
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Is this rock?

632
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, is this Kingman or is this multiple?

633
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm leaning towards multiple craft.

634
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So within the within the Wilson Davis document, this goes into further about kind of what the program says.

635
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The technology is not from this earth in this document.

636
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I think MJ 12 is also.

637
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, Miller Miller also asked about MJ 12.

638
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I can't remember right now if if whatever his name if sorry, Admiral Wilson and Eric Davis, my mind's kind of spinning right now.

639
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm sorry guys for any mix ups.

640
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But what is interesting here is for Thomas Wilson to talk about Corso Philip J Corso if you guys haven't read the day after Roswell.

641
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I would highly recommend reading that mentioned the SAP OCC and the reorganization of SAP SAP OCC and the program almost being found in an audit in the mid 90s.

642
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I highly recommend reading the black budget of the United States by Catherine Austin fits here.

643
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Anyways, we'll come back to that.

644
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So Eric Davis.

645
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'll read this word for word, but I, you know, I'm not really like a react content type of guy, but we'll just do that.

646
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Okay, Eric Davis says to Andre.

647
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
No, he told me that he would deny meeting with me.

648
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Should I publish anything about that?

649
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I never published anything about our meeting, but Ed Mitchell's unethical kids released his copy covered by Ed signed NDA of my friends of my interview notes to a friend who had an interest in UFOs.

650
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The latter individual is responsible for shopping the notes at a UFO conference to the highest bidder, which was Grant Cameron unethical Grant Cameron consulted a lawyer and decided to publicize the interview notes on this YouTube channel and a podcast.

651
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
After this is when Wilson denied meeting me when contacted by multiple ufologists and UFO media personalities and mainstream news reporters.

652
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But here's the issue with that guys.

653
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I have.

654
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Remember James Rigney I covered in the video he was the one who kind of got the memo out of the estate got it to Grant Cameron.

655
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
James Rigney was not sold this document.

656
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Whoever the individual in Edgar Mitchell Oscar Edgar Mitchell's estate.

657
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Went through his files and between between James Rigney and this individual I don't know who this individual is.

658
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And James Rigney shared this with Grant Cameron in fact I have James Rigney up here because to talk about like a Edgar Mitchell's unethical kids I don't think this involved his children at all besides just a relative and Grant Cameron I don't think was sold this document as well.

659
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So James Rigney says I showed these notes to Grant and then a few weeks later sent him a copy yes and I've talked to James about this he said this to me.

660
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
To say they were hawked around to the highest bidder is ludicrous yes there was never a mention of any sale here.

661
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Dr Mitchell's family were not involved at all other than Dr Mitchell's nephew now deceased I'm happy to clear any of this up.

662
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:45,000
James Rigney has started to he doesn't post much but I really like that he's talking about this because I think by Eric Davis here he's obviously a little emotional about the Wilson Davis memo and he might not be fully familiar with the process of how it leaked.

663
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But I will say before the memo made its way to public multiple people have seen the memo right multiple researchers have.

664
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I have also talked to an individual who told me in an off record conversation that he was aware of the memo years before it was ever released so there's some pretty important people who know about this.

665
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And I'm not familiar with Nicole actually actually yeah we just talked about Nicole but she has an email from Grant Cameron regarding this.

666
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:26,000
She's Grant Cameron says wow someone is pissed for the record I never shop the Wilson Davis memo notes I promised James Rigney that I would put them in beyond managing magic.

667
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
When I realized I could not do that I just made the notes free to anyone who asked about them.

668
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Chase Williams got a copy and helped me.

669
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If everyone had stopped playing cover up I would never have been in such a position.

670
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Usually Eric is pretty accurate.

671
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
He messed up his sovereignty accusations and losing that I would have thought he would be a little more quiet.

672
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
For the record many of the top researchers have now confirmed they have had the Wilson documents for years and chose to sit on it.

673
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Yes, I've definitely heard that too.

674
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Why must I be the guy to have to disclose stuff other to disclose stuff other disclosure researchers are hiding.

675
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Wilson documents Johnson UFO study.

676
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Interesting.

677
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Douglas aircraft documents.

678
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Interesting.

679
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Advanced physics group notes Rockefeller initiative documents.

680
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Interesting.

681
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And yet vindicated the alien autopsy emails for anybody who hasn't heard about the alien autopsy emails that surrounds the supposed alien autopsy film that was obviously faked in like 11 apartment.

682
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But that might be based on a real sort of autopsy there's an email chain with Dr. Kit Green that covers this.

683
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So that's what that's what I would like to cover that too because that's very interesting the future.

684
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Finally, almost all of the stuff I disclose.

685
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I have never read the only I only had to read the first page of the Wilson interview to know what I was holding.

686
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Interesting to see Mitchell had to sign an NDA.

687
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I assume Bigelow controlled that that's very interesting Edgar Mitchell sign an NDA to receive these meeting notes.

688
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
If businessmen can silence researchers with NDAs.

689
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Why is the community always crying about unethical government obeying their NDAs.

690
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
No one ever offered me money.

691
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Therefore, I was never forced to sign my life away and lie my ass off.

692
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So, yeah, I think Grant Cameron makes a really powerful statement here.

693
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So I guess the question is now, why did Eric Davis wait until 2024 to discuss the Wilson Davis Mumble.

694
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I find that Eric Davis I kind of said this earlier kind of pops up and around when he makes to make statements whether this be discounting guys like Jason Sands discounting Bob Lazar and so forth.

695
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Lou, I mean, sorry, Eric Davis has been on kind of a tear lately, talking about Lou saying that he Lou never ran all sapper and a tip specifically.

696
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So it seems that I really can't think of an exact reason why now of all times he would discuss the Wilson Davis document.

697
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:55,000
If you remember back to 2004 in Stephen Green Street's basement episode, Green Street actually asked Eric Davis about the memo and Eric Davis just gave the hole.

698
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I cannot confirm or deny that.

699
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So why now but this is really interesting and extremely consequential.

700
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I remember back in the day, guys like John Greenwald and John Greenwald has a fantastic new video on all to all sap and a tip.

701
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I really recommend watching that.

702
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But he I think he thought the Wilson Davis notes at least I'm not thought he proposed a theory they might be like a film script.

703
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So there was just a lot of information shopping around about them.

704
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So let's look at some of these comments real fast before we carry on this.

705
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Am I mistaken or does Robert Bigelow always seem to get a pass because he's interested in this stuff could be totally wrong.

706
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But does anybody ask him to put up or shut up?

707
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
No, that's a good point.

708
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Of course, he's been interested in kind of knit, of course, behind nids and kind of a consciousness studies and after death studies.

709
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
He has been very quiet since a lot of this is has been discussed.

710
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's because Eric Davis still has a security clearance.

711
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yes, pretty clear.

712
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The memo is real.

713
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
That's why he has to do these obtuse attempts at obfuscation.

714
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah, I the at least to myself, I'll admit kind of my biases here.

715
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I've always considered the Wilson Davis memo since I began researching it to be authentic.

716
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I find just so much valuable information in the memo.

717
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And if you guys haven't read it, I really recommend reading it.

718
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think in my video on the Wilson Davis memo, I have it linked.

719
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So shall we talk about the, unless anybody has any questions, we'll discuss the 2004 kind of JSOC.

720
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You know, is this better for everybody at the black better for everybody's screen?

721
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Probably next we'll talk about the JSOC.

722
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So Davis admits to what he has is controlling narrative.

723
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's true.

724
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

725
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That is a good point.

726
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Doesn't anyone think it's weird to go with the serious TSS clearance would discuss something like this and on and not use not like signal.

727
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah, it is weird, but I know I think it's that same Facebook group or others.

728
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Eric Davis has been very cavalier about about like Bob Lazar, Jason Sands.

729
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
He seems to really like a kind of blab about this.

730
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So how do you flip the style?

731
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
If you have a Sumatra PDF, all you have to do is press I, and it really helps.

732
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Sumatra PDF is the best.

733
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I highly recommend it.

734
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Okay.

735
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So what let's get to this last one by LC in the weaponized ed cat or weaponized episode with Ernie Klein.

736
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
He mentions anytime he brought up the memo around Davis put off, etc.

737
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
other spines would go rigid truth.

738
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So which recently Ross Colt Hart did an AMA on Reddit.

739
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I think this is his second one.

740
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The first time he did an AMA, I think the vast majority of the questions were saying Ross tell us where the craft is in regards to what the

741
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
craft is in regards to when Ross discussed a craft so large that a building had to be built around it.

742
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
This AMA was very different.

743
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
People asked a lot of great questions.

744
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Of course, people are kind of discussing skinny Bob and stuff like that again.

745
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And somebody said, let's see if I can pull it up.

746
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Sorry, I'm not like a guest browser here.

747
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Ross called her.

748
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
No.

749
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm not a robot motorcycles.

750
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
No, the helmets won't count.

751
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Traffic lights really.

752
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Why do you guys have to and you guys watch me do this?

753
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I'll probably mess it up.

754
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
There we go.

755
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Look who we got in the chat.

756
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Just bought.

757
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What's up, Michael?

758
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Thanks so much for tuning in.

759
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Hey, cool.

760
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
What's going on, man?

761
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Thank you.

762
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I really appreciate you tuning in.

763
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That's awesome.

764
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm going to leave this up for a little bit.

765
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I really appreciate that, Michael.

766
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We're just about to talk about the 2004 incident and sentinels of ether.

767
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Just because I think so many people have been talking about John Stewart.

768
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And this 2004 incident and there hasn't really been a lot of look back to

769
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
sentinels of ether.

770
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So let's get started, guys.

771
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Shardu Shardul 127 or Shardul 27.

772
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And this guy's actually in my discord.

773
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This was a fantastic question.

774
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So if you are watching right now, thanks, dude.

775
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I know he posted this in the discord.

776
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So thank you.

777
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
This is a fantastic question.

778
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Hi, Ross.

779
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Thank you for all that you have done and will do with this topic.

780
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Is there any merit to the claim that in 2004 there was a blue on blue

781
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
firefight between a JSOC unit and a Lockheed Martin recovery team over

782
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
UAP craft resulting in the deaths of two JSOC members?

783
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Ross says just straight up yes and recomments.

784
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And that's not the only incident.

785
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So now we have Ross commenting on the validity out.

786
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And of course, this is just Ross.

787
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
He hasn't posted any sources or data for this.

788
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
How do I join the discord server?

789
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I think I can post a link here.

790
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Let me post it.

791
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Sorry, let me post that real fast.

792
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Invite people.

793
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah, if that link works.

794
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So, yes.

795
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So we have Ross cold heart commenting on a 2004 blue on blue situation.

796
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
We have John Stewart's story.

797
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I believe this came out in late 2023.

798
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I think this was in December.

799
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And this was about an individual reaching out to.

800
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Let's get Michael's chat back up here.

801
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
That's cool.

802
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
This was about an individual reaching out to John about a story of a blue

803
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
on blue firefight that occurred in, I think, I think.

804
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So there's a difference here now between the two sources.

805
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I think that Stewart source and we'll get through this as we read through.

806
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Claim to this event occurred near the Texas side of the border in the Texas

807
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and Mexico border.

808
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Sentinels of ether talks about this being on the Koyame Mexico side of the

809
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
border, which as we know from the Koyame video is very close to the Texas border.

810
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So I'll read just this, just the initial message.

811
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And then we'll kind of just pick and choose through.

812
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I don't just want to, this isn't story time.

813
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I'm just not going to read through everything.

814
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Hi, John.

815
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I saw one of your recent podcasts.

816
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Thank you for covering the UAP topic.

817
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I have some information you may find useful for this.

818
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I served in the USMC and Defense Intelligence Agency as an intelligence

819
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
analyst and then moved on to Lockheed as a security program manager.

820
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I no longer work at Lockheed.

821
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I was read into the UAP program and the UAP issue is multifaceted.

822
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Well, generally it's known to the public at this point from the recent news

823
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
articles that the United States USG has its own recovery and storage team for

824
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
downed in HICraft.

825
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Most of the people, okay, sorry.

826
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Most of the people in USG community know about downed craft.

827
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
This is where the real core of the UAP issue lies, not the religious

828
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
implications or the biologics.

829
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Lockheed has had this team since the 1970s and have amassed a hoard of both

830
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
intact and crashed UAP at a facility in Palmdale, California.

831
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
At some point around the mid 1980s, they were able to successfully reverse

832
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
engineer one of these NHICraft and keep this hidden and completely

833
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
obfuscated from the USG.

834
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
One of my senior security managers was firsthand legacy witness to this.

835
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Lockheed even relinquished some of the original NHICraft back into the

836
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
custody of USG and lied, quote, saying that they could make no progress.

837
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
This is where the heart of the dispute between Congress today and Lockheed

838
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
is coming in to head in Schumer's recent UAP bill demanding the tech from

839
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
the UAP legacy program.

840
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
The USG realized that it was lied to about, sorry, I'm just having trouble

841
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
reading.

842
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The USG realized it was lied to about the progress and now want full custody

843
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
of the ARV vehicles that Lockheed currently has.

844
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Even though I was read into the general UAP program, I was never privy to

845
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
this specific group while I worked for Lockheed, the in-house recovery team.

846
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
There were only brief water cooler discussions I had with people directly

847
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
involved that are personal friends I've known for many years.

848
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So let's stop before we get into the incident here.

849
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
USG for anyone asking is US government.

850
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Hey, Aiden, my contacts get dry fast.

851
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I know I blink a lot.

852
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I saw that in the interview with Ryan Wood.

853
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I blinked a ton.

854
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But USG is the United States government.

855
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
The story here, what is really interesting is so many times throughout

856
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
my videos, we've covered a retrieval effort, mostly like spearheaded by

857
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the Air Force and so forth, Air Force elements, possibly JSOC.

858
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
There's good reason to believe that something like the 24th STS group

859
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
within JSOC and the Air Force has some part to play in crash retrievals.

860
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
There's actually a Reddit whistleblower, a supposed whistleblower a couple

861
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
months ago that had a really interesting testimony on this.

862
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But to hear this about private corporation recovery teams, this is

863
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
really interesting and not something that we have covered too much.

864
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Of course, there's the idea of these black operative black operator programs

865
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that deal with craft and deal with humans and deal with operations.

866
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But we have never really explored the extent to which they have

867
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
recovered downcraft.

868
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So here this individual reaching out to John Stuart claims that Lockheed

869
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Martin has its own recovery team.

870
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Now, I can't remember and we'll get through this if this describes

871
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
kind of the experience of the operators, what they have if they're

872
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
former like tier one, if they're just PMC guys.

873
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm not quite sure, but this is really interesting to dive into this territory

874
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
about basically a private team that is not associated with kind of US

875
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
operations.

876
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
As we get into this, this raises some even more interesting questions

877
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
how this Lockheed Martin recovery team deals with JSOC units.

878
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And if you don't know JSOC, this is joint special operations command.

879
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
This is the best of the best in US armed forces.

880
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
This is like 24th STS.

881
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This is one 60th division.

882
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
This is Navy SEAL Team 6.

883
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
This is Green Beret.

884
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
These are just some bad dudes.

885
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So I'll keep, let's see how much longer we got in this.

886
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah.

887
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay.

888
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I'll read the rest of this and then we'll discuss.

889
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I know of an incident in 2004 where one of Lockheed's own reverse

890
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
engineered ARV craft, one of Lockheed's own reverse engineered

891
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicle, crashed into the Southwest.

892
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The USG was monitoring.

893
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
They thought it was genuine NHI craft.

894
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
They sent their own recovery team out from JSOC, but there was a

895
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
violent altercation between them and the Lockheed recovery team

896
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
that resulted in two deaths.

897
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
This is the incident Grush is referring to when he says people

898
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
have been killed to keep the UAP secret.

899
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
This was a blue on blue situation between two completely separate

900
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
recovery teams.

901
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The USG group had no awareness of the other one.

902
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I was privy to the names of two cuts off our satellite office.

903
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
However, I would not go to public and I am not sure about releasing

904
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
this information.

905
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
The only caveat to this is I remember the names of the two airmen

906
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
that were killed, especially stuck out to me because they were

907
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
both clearly of Asian descent.

908
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I am Asian myself.

909
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I debated a few times trying to inquire a way to track down

910
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
immediate relatives and maybe contacting them.

911
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I don't know what should be done.

912
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Honestly, I'm fairly certain the immediate families to this day

913
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
are not aware of the actual circumstances regarding their passing.

914
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think John and him kind of go back a little bit there.

915
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Here we are faced with the kind of, yes, I think 0604 says this

916
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
friendly fire here.

917
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
This is blue on blue action here.

918
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like Michael says, JSOC has a bunch of good guys.

919
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
This is really interesting.

920
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Here we are faced with the prospect of a US based retrieval team.

921
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
They have their rapid reaction unit and they see this craft they

922
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
think is an HII craft.

923
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Then there's the Lockheed Martin team that knows that their own

924
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
reverse engineered ARV has crashed and they sent their team.

925
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
There's a collision between the forces and JSOC, maybe they got the

926
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
jump on them, which is surprising because JSOC again is the best of

927
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the best by this PMC, Private Military Corporation, almost

928
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Lockheed team.

929
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
We have this story here and I will link this in the discord if

930
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
anybody wants to read more because there's a lot here.

931
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But this parallels the story told by the insider that Michael has

932
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
spoken to who published two chapters of a manuscript called

933
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Sentinels of Ether, which is kind of used in this individual's

934
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
words as basically a ploy on dops or similar to secret machines

935
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
by Tom DeLonge to put truth and fiction to get out information.

936
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I think this was also done back in the 80s or 90s with Sedge

937
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Masters and Project Zodiac.

938
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So this isn't a new tactic.

939
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
This has been done multiple times.

940
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And yes, that is really terrifying.

941
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But we won't read Sentinels of Ether, but I have just read it

942
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
recently so I can tell you a little more about what it's about.

943
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
This story doesn't directly deal with a craft recovery.

944
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This deals with people being trafficked.

945
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And there is basically a JSOC team that gets the jump on, not

946
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
necessarily the jump, but they observe this trafficking operation

947
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
from some Hueys.

948
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And this JSOC team is cornered and killed brutally by whatever

949
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
this team is that are trafficking these individuals.

950
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
The individuals are in Koyama, Mexico, and they load up on their

951
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
helicopters, maybe with their cargo, maybe not, and they fly

952
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
to a secret base around the region.

953
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
So those are the differences here.

954
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
There's no mention of Lockheed in the Sentinels of Ether story.

955
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
There's no mention of Lockheed in John Stuart's whistleblower.

956
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
There's no mention of craft in Sentinels of Ether, but there's

957
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
mention of craft in John Stuart's whistleblower.

958
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
There's a direct location given in Sentinels of Ether, including

959
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Koyama, Mexico.

960
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's a little different in John Stuart's, which calls mainland

961
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
US.

962
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So those are the small differences.

963
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Of course, we don't have direct supporting evidence, but this

964
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
2004, this reminds me so closely of the 1974 Koyama incident,

965
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
which occurred 40 years later in the same place in Koyama,

966
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Mexico.

967
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
If you guys haven't watched that video, this is about an alleged

968
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
story of a crash that occurred on the Mexican side of the

969
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
border seen by people in kind of a remote area.

970
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
A Mexican retrieval team is sent to investigate.

971
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
The CIA has the jump on this recovery operation, and they send

972
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
in the rapid reaction unit.

973
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
But something based on their surveillance has shown that the

974
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Mexican retrieval team has stopped, was killed by something.

975
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
This is, and the Americans take over the wreckage.

976
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Now, it's still not clear if the Mexican retrieval team was

977
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
killed from some sort of leakage from the craft or that the

978
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
US killed them.

979
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And still, this is just a story.

980
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
There's not a lot of evidence for that case.

981
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I covered it because it's so interesting.

982
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But so we have, we have the Sentinels of Ether story.

983
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
We have the 2004 John Stuart, supposed whistleblower.

984
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And then we have the 1974 Koyame instant, which all kind of tie in

985
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
together.

986
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's an extremely interesting story.

987
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'll be interested to see if John Stuart has a further comment on

988
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
this.

989
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
As far as I know, he hasn't said very much.

990
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I think people have just kind of been, I think he's just kind of

991
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
been saying like, haha, like I got it.

992
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I think he's just kind of been celebrating the victory on her.

993
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We still don't know if his whistleblower is telling the truth.

994
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I think that this person kind of went AWOL and AFK after this

995
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
and John tried to follow up with him, but there wasn't, but there

996
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
wasn't, he couldn't get in contact with the guy.

997
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So let's, if there's any questions now, let's, let's go through them.

998
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I just kind of wanted to touch on that because I felt like a lot of

999
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
people were drawing to attention to the, to John Stuart's

1000
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
locking Martin whistleblower, but there was some parts of the

1001
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
puzzle missing to factor in Sentinels of Ether and the 1974

1002
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Koyame incident.

1003
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So, yeah.

1004
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So if anybody has any questions, we'll, we'll kind of go through

1005
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
that and maybe in about like 10, 15 minutes, we'll, we'll start

1006
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
wrapping up.

1007
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm, I'm trying to think of any other kind of breaking into

1008
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
incidents right now.

1009
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I would like to know what you guys think of imminent so far.

1010
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Again, I haven't read the full thing.

1011
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I've mostly been catching up on loose media appearances so far.

1012
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
And okay, let's, let's, let's see this.

1013
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Michael says, Ross has definitely been in touch with me on

1014
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
some details, not too much since he's busy, but soon I expect to

1015
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
meet with him and tell him face to face.

1016
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Now I would really be interested to see what Ross and Michael

1017
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
discuss.

1018
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
If everybody remembers Ross's previous AMA, somebody asked him

1019
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
like, what do you think of the Michael Herrera case?

1020
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And he says he was actively investigating.

1021
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So I'm really excited to hear further developments on that.

1022
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So that's wildly exciting.

1023
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Let me get a sip of water here.

1024
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So yeah, besides that guys, again, I'm hoping to, I'm hoping to

1025
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
see Jesse Michaels quite soon.

1026
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I think he's, I think he's coming out to the state and I'm excited to

1027
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
meet up with him.

1028
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
We are working on the, I kind of leaked it.

1029
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I don't really like to say it, but let's, let's, the group I

1030
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
encountered is private, but plucked from former special operations

1031
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
groups.

1032
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I know some of them personally, but they are good guys helping me

1033
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
with that.

1034
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah.

1035
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah.

1036
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah.

1037
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah.

1038
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yeah.

1039
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yeah.

1040
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah.

1041
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And that's something I wanted to talk on.

1042
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Remember in the Arrow historical report volume one, they claimed

1043
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
that Michael said to them that he encountered us special forces.

1044
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
No, and Michael has been clear about this since the beginning

1045
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
that he encountered a private team that had no association that

1046
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
he knew at the time from American special forces.

1047
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Let's, okay, let's start going through these.

1048
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I'm catching this room a bit late, but I'm so lost.

1049
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I'm not on all this.

1050
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I thoughts on all this about I, but tell me why you're lost.

1051
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Man, I'll get you up.

1052
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

1053
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I know I can drag on a bit.

1054
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
That's why I like to make scripts because I can just drone on

1055
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
about AI designating designing craft and military being infiltrated

1056
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
to the point where top secret stuff needs to be hidden.

1057
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I have a, I have a good friend who actually is working on like a

1058
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
really good thesis about kind of the phenomenon and, and craft

1059
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
being sort of like a really AI driven and maybe like a biomechanical

1060
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
artificial intelligence.

1061
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,480
And so I would kind of like to follow up with him on that.

1062
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,240
Pete says, imminent as part of the drip feed of disclosure,

1063
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,640
anything cleared for official releases.

1064
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,120
Why are they starting to disclose is the interesting part.

1065
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,160
Yeah, I agree.

1066
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,300
Why is, like, why does Dobser approve of Lou

1067
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,800
discussing a 1950 crash retrieval case?

1068
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,920
Why does Dobser approve of Lou

1069
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,080
discussing Operation Interloper and so forth?

1070
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,960
This is very interesting.

1071
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,280
Everything is cleared with Dobser.

1072
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,880
Same with David Grush as well.

1073
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,960
The idea of a drip feed of disclosure is interesting

1074
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,080
because, of course, there's likely elements within USG

1075
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,680
that are deeply entwined in the program

1076
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,280
who do not want any of this information to come out.

1077
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,200
Is there ever a point where top secret stuff

1078
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,040
doesn't need to be hidden?

1079
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,080
I think, I can't remember,

1080
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,240
but I think people like Grush and Elizondo

1081
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,880
have a great take on this.

1082
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,720
With NHI technology and so forth,

1083
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,240
perhaps the technology itself

1084
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,680
and how to operate this technology can remain classified.

1085
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,840
You don't need someone who would wish harm to others,

1086
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,160
being able to harness a craft that can go supersonic

1087
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,000
in an eighth of a second.

1088
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,960
But I think the reality of this situation

1089
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,760
shouldn't be classified top secret.

1090
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,640
I think all of humanity has a right to know the extent

1091
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,520
to what program officials and people high up in USG

1092
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,520
and the military know about UFOs,

1093
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,680
their purpose on this planet,

1094
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,720
their modus operandi and so forth.

1095
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,520
What is your opinion on Salvador Pais?

1096
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
Pais is super interesting.

1097
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,880
I covered him in the Off-World Technologies Division.

1098
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,880
He worked out of NAVAR, the Naval Air Facility in Maryland.

1099
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,520
And he, of course, has patents on kind of almost like a

1100
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,720
kind of quantum vacuum fluctuations,

1101
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,920
powering like an almost diamond or triangular shaped craft.

1102
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,320
If you haven't, I really recommend listening to his appearance

1103
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,320
on Kurt Geimungal's theory of everything

1104
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,520
where he talks a little bit more about physics.

1105
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,720
Physics was never my strong suit, so I'm not,

1106
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,320
I don't have a ton of interesting things to add there,

1107
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,920
but Salvador Pais is super interesting.

1108
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
And I find his patents wild,

1109
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,720
especially how they were initially denied,

1110
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,720
but they were picked up by the Navy.

1111
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,520
And he was working out of NAVAR, Pax River.

1112
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,920
What's up, OptiV? How you doing, man?

1113
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,920
Great to see you.

1114
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,320
Great to see you, brother.

1115
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,720
Danny Sheehan answered Mitchell's question

1116
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,920
in Jesse Michaels' interview.

1117
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,720
He said it's because Lockheed wants the license to tech

1118
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,720
and sell it.

1119
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,720
Okay, I haven't, I don't remember that part,

1120
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,720
but thank you for saying that.

1121
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Have I been interviewed before? No, I don't know.

1122
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,720
No, I have not.

1123
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,720
That kind of would be fun, but as you can tell,

1124
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,720
I kind of ramble, so we'd see how that goes.

1125
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,720
Group C says imminent is crap.

1126
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,720
Excuse my French, a mix of truth and lies.

1127
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,720
That's how good disinformation works.

1128
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Lou is clear to say what he says.

1129
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,720
Of course, there's still a lot of discourse around Lou,

1130
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,720
ASAP, and ATIP.

1131
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,720
If you guys haven't, I know he can be a divisive member

1132
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,720
in the community, but John Greenwald's recent video on kind

1133
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,720
of the memorandums and different files that have been released

1134
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,720
from ATIP and ASAP surrounding Lou and other players.

1135
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,720
That is super interesting, and I really highly recommend that.

1136
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,720
It makes the can of worms so much deeper.

1137
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,720
So please watch that.

1138
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,720
China stand is why Kona Blue was proposed.

1139
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,720
Lockheed went into the vest of its materials,

1140
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,720
and Kona Blue was meant to be the way that happened,

1141
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,720
and to the CIA put a kibosh on it.

1142
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Yeah, to divest materials into the hands

1143
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,720
of Bigelow Aerospace from Lockheed Martin.

1144
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,720
You got a signed copy of imminent.

1145
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,720
That's awesome, man.

1146
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,720
That's super cool.

1147
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,720
That's super cool.

1148
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,720
Since imminent had to go through the Pentagon approval

1149
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,720
for its contents, I think the section on alien implants

1150
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,720
is a slow drip for acknowledging abduction phenomena.

1151
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,720
Scary thought.

1152
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,720
Yeah, again, we talked about implants a little earlier.

1153
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,720
I think the basis of that work needs to come off

1154
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,720
of Dr. Lear's work throughout history,

1155
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,720
because it's just such a strange concept

1156
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,720
to wrap your head around, and the implications

1157
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,720
of the abduction phenomena, if true,

1158
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,720
are extremely disturbing as well.

1159
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Anytime someone monetizes UFO stuff,

1160
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,720
I'm out, YouTube doesn't count for now.

1161
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,720
So that's like the grifter argument, right?

1162
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,720
I don't think Lou is a grifter at all.

1163
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,720
I think that after many years, for whatever reason,

1164
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,720
he's releasing this book.

1165
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:16,720
But I do agree that a lot of people will just kind of make

1166
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,720
a lot of UFO content or big claims for not much reason.

1167
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,720
But I personally wouldn't throw Lou in that category,

1168
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,720
but I still need to read all of him in it.

1169
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,720
So my opinion is not fully formed.

1170
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,720
I have one huge advice to you before you get into abjections

1171
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,720
and all that.

1172
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,720
Learn about the science.

1173
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Listen to Tom Bearden's lectures, because if you don't,

1174
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
you'll think that everything is E.T.

1175
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,720
Absolutely.

1176
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,720
Absolutely.

1177
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
Well, I appreciate that.

1178
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,720
With any subject getting into,

1179
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,720
I want to make sure I have a strong foundation for research.

1180
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,720
Dobser is only there to censor classified specific details.

1181
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,720
Lou chooses his references carefully

1182
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
and tiptoes around classified details.

1183
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
Yes, he does.

1184
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,720
You can see that in the JRE interview and so forth.

1185
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,720
Lou is very good at drawing the line where he's speculating

1186
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,720
and not speculating and drawing the line where he can't go

1187
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,720
further and drawing the line to say,

1188
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,720
I can't talk about this, but here is an example.

1189
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,720
Also, what do you guys think about the Lou on JRE appearance?

1190
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,720
I think Lou, I think Joe was a lot softer on Lou

1191
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,720
than he was on David Grush.

1192
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,720
I was re-listening to the David Grush interview recently.

1193
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,720
And Joe, a lot of the time, you see,

1194
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,720
almost took a position of disbelief to everything Grush said,

1195
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,720
which was a little strange to me, a little strange.

1196
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,720
Kelly Cahill is where to start looking for abductions.

1197
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,720
Gotcha.

1198
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,720
Gotcha.

1199
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,720
Do you know of any other good UAP YouTubers?

1200
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,720
Watch all of your vids and want more info.

1201
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:48,720
So I don't watch too much UFO related content.

1202
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,720
And part of the reason I made this channel is I thought there was

1203
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,720
a bit of a lapse in serious research outside of guys like Richard Dolan.

1204
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:01,720
So my advice would be just to read, to be honest.

1205
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,720
I would read Leonard Stringfield's Crash Retrievals one through seven.

1206
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,720
Those are brilliant.

1207
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,720
I would read Stephen Greer's disclosure briefing document from 2001.

1208
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,720
I would read Magic Eyes Only by Ryan Wood.

1209
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,720
I would read In Plain Sight by Ross Colthart.

1210
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,720
But I would also watch Ross Colthart interviews on the kind of need to know

1211
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,720
as well as anything he's done with Bryce Zabel.

1212
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,720
There's also a lot of good old documentaries such as stuff with James Fox.

1213
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,720
So as far as content goes, I don't know.

1214
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:38,720
I'm not too familiar with other UFO content creators besides some of the big dogs like Dolan.

1215
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,720
Sad to hear Lou is financially hurt by TTSA.

1216
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:47,720
Yeah, of course that kind of muddies up TTSA.

1217
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,720
So what do you think about the Orbs in Lou's house?

1218
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,720
I find it very strange.

1219
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,720
Kind of he really doesn't hesitate to go into kind of like the Hitchhiker effect of UAP

1220
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,720
and strange stuff following him home from work at ATV.

1221
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,720
I think even his wife commented on this as well.

1222
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,720
I'll have to find her comments, but that was really interesting to see her wife talk about that.

1223
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,720
Matt's under his correction.

1224
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,720
Danny Sheehan, tiptoes and whispers to Lou.

1225
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,720
Back to Pete.

1226
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,720
And abductions are the hardest part to swallow once the realization of UAP is real.

1227
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
It's terrifying.

1228
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,720
I agree.

1229
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,720
The implications of abductions are very terrifying.

1230
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,720
I remember growing up that one of the first books I had was a book on Betty and Barty Hill,

1231
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,720
and it just scared the life out of me as a kid.

1232
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,720
John Greenwald clearly has a theory about why, in his words, both sides are lying.

1233
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,720
Do you have any thoughts on what John's theory may be?

1234
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:41,720
Yeah, I think in his latest video, he says very specifically, neither side is telling the truth.

1235
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:46,720
And this could just be, like I can't think for John, of course.

1236
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,720
Even though I don't always agree with everything he says,

1237
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,720
I think John is a pretty well thought out person.

1238
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,720
He takes his time to craft his theses.

1239
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,720
So I would wait to hear from him, but of course this could possibly be,

1240
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,720
he just thinks this is room to muddy the water around the UAP discussion

1241
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,720
and create endless debate about atyp and asap.

1242
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,720
I talked about this already, but how is Japan?

1243
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,720
Japan was the greatest place I've ever been and has the best food I've ever had.

1244
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,720
I want to go back so bad.

1245
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,720
I didn't get to go to Kodokanjudo in Tokyo and I went to so bad.

1246
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,720
So bad.

1247
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,720
It was obviously a PR deal and Joe didn't take it seriously with Grush or Lou.

1248
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,720
Yeah, it was strange that he didn't take it seriously.

1249
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,720
I think that David Grush is one of the most valuable people to speak to right now.

1250
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,720
So it was strange.

1251
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,720
It was bizarre, Lou.

1252
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,720
I think he made a conscious effort and he talked about this on JRE,

1253
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,720
that he was on JRE to talk about the phenomenon and not plug his own book,

1254
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,720
which I definitely respect, but he gave John Greenwald a huge shout out.

1255
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,720
And I know that Greenwald has had his huge problems

1256
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,720
and has been very outspoken about Lou.

1257
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,720
So that was interesting to see.

1258
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,720
I think it's curious how all the Senate hearings started right after the Chinese balloon.

1259
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,720
What are the odds that UAP topic is used as a vehicle to pass reforms with that deal with foreign stuff?

1260
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,720
I do not think so because if we look at the Schumann legislation for both 2023 and 2024,

1261
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:07,720
it is very, very, very clear that the subject we're dealing with is non-human technology and legacy programs.

1262
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,720
Very clear.

1263
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:16,720
I think in the 2024 NDAA, non-human intelligence has mentioned about 27 times, I think it is.

1264
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,720
I feel like him not plugging his book was partially to avoid.

1265
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,720
Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,720
I agree.

1267
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,720
I agree.

1268
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,720
Timothy Good's Unearthly Disclosure is an excellent book.

1269
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,720
Yes.

1270
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,720
And was it Timothy Good that also wrote above?

1271
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,720
They're not above Top Secret.

1272
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,720
Need to know was that his book, but Timothy Good is great.

1273
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,720
I can't remember right now.

1274
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,720
If Lou can do remote view, why doesn't he hold a bit of demonstrations?

1275
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,720
Unlike UFO UAP, he has control on that.

1276
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,720
I would like to see demonstrations from people who claim they can operate remote viewing.

1277
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,720
I feel such a strange territory for me.

1278
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,720
I'd really like to see that.

1279
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,720
First thought was a skunk work spying on him.

1280
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:56,720
I'd like to understand the technology behind those dang orbs then, especially if they can operate indoors.

1281
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,720
I have a three paragraph argument regarding UAP origins and the phenomena of abductions.

1282
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,720
If anyone is interested to see it, where could I post?

1283
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:11,720
My friend, you could email that to me at uapgrub at gmail.com or you could join my discord and post that to see.

1284
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,720
I'll copy that and put the link in one more time because I'd love to read it.

1285
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,720
I'd absolutely love to read it.

1286
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,720
Sounds awesome.

1287
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,720
Lou's wife was in the News Nation interview.

1288
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,720
Okay.

1289
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,720
The grifter argument makes no sense.

1290
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,720
Take Greer, for example.

1291
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,720
He does two CE5 events a year.

1292
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,720
He's not a millionaire.

1293
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,720
How can he fund the disclosure project?

1294
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,720
Whistleblower needs his events with no money.

1295
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:42,720
I bet Greer, I do think that Greer has income streams outside of just UAP if I had to guess.

1296
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,720
I know he used to be a practicing ER trauma doctor, but I'm not sure.

1297
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:52,720
Mike says, I'm not sure why, but it seems very human that the orbs followed him after he was investigating from within the Pentagon.

1298
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,720
That's very strange.

1299
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,720
I need to read that passage in imminent.

1300
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,720
Again, sort of like with remote viewing and stuff, that territory is very foreign for me.

1301
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:08,720
I approach it slowly when I read about it because it's uncomfortable for me, which I'm sure it is for many of you.

1302
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,720
What is your methodology for conducting research?

1303
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,720
That is a really good question.

1304
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,720
I really appreciate that.

1305
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:25,720
When I'm investigating a crash retrieval, for example, I will find a respected person that has covered this crash retrieval before.

1306
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:32,720
For example, for the 1974 case in Koyame, Mexico, that was Ryan Wood in Magic Eyes Only.

1307
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,720
He covered the case.

1308
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,720
I use that as a starting point.

1309
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:42,720
From that, I make a personal note sheet for myself of every single aspect I want to check out.

1310
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:48,720
Then every single aspect, for example, Koyame mentions Fort Bliss and stuff like that.

1311
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:54,720
I will go look at ufo-search.com, which is a great website by Richard Geldreich.

1312
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,720
I can't remember that post events by date.

1313
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:05,720
I will start researching if there's any blue book, sorry, not blue book, but any recorded sightings or information on that day.

1314
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,720
If any official documents have been released about aspects of Fort Bliss and operations there on that day,

1315
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,720
or any official documents exist around that case, I'll analyze the Moondust Archive.

1316
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,720
I'll analyze the Blue Book Archive.

1317
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:21,720
I'll analyze if any popular figures on UAP disclosure have talked about this.

1318
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,720
Then I'll start researching the subject I'm working on in books.

1319
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:31,720
For example, I know when I covered a ufo case, I had to go into some of Jacques Valet's old works.

1320
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:36,720
My research always conducts with starting a foundational layer and topics I want to branch out on,

1321
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:43,720
and using various websites and books to find out more information and continue that as a decision tree.

1322
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:50,720
The most important part for my research, as I'm sure it would be for anybody, is really good record keeping,

1323
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,720
because there's so much you can find when researching any case.

1324
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:59,720
What's important to me is to have bullet points for subjects and appropriate links,

1325
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:05,720
and from there have even further offshoots and just dive into what I find interesting about the cases.

1326
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:12,720
Then when I can form a thesis, I'll start to think how I can write a topic when using my references and evidence.

1327
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm an engineer by trait, so I approach each script as I would, like an engineering research paper,

1328
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:27,720
kind of like an introduction, an abstract, the data, the investigation, the conclusion, the references, and so forth.

1329
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,720
Keep up the great work. Thank you, man. You're one of the very few people that do thorough research.

1330
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:36,720
You're like Richard Dolan in his early days, and not only not as naive. I appreciate that. I love you too, man.

1331
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,720
Thank you so much. I love doing this. This topic is so multifaceted.

1332
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:46,720
It's so tough to kind of get to the bottom of anything, so I'm just kind of trying to do my part,

1333
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,720
slowing things down, analyze things on a case-by-case or topic-by-topic basis.

1334
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,720
Steph says, hey, Grubb, appreciate you for life, brother, and thank you, man.

1335
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,720
I'm sure thousands of us feel the same. What do you think the phenomena actually is?

1336
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,720
What's your theory so far if you could share? Sorry if asked.

1337
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,720
So this has always been really interesting.

1338
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,720
I've always kind of bounced between the thought of extraterrestrials versus

1339
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,720
what some people like to refer to as, like, ultra-terrestrials,

1340
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:20,720
a.k.a. beams that may not exist in our three dimensions, spatial dimensions, and one temporal dimension.

1341
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:28,720
Lately, I've found quite a bit of credible testimony that refers to crashed craft as specifically extraterrestrial.

1342
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:33,720
So there could be a combination of a presence on this planet, extraterrestrial,

1343
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,720
and some things that don't necessarily exist in maybe a corporeal body

1344
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,720
or what we would think as a physical being.

1345
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:47,720
But right now, if I just had to think out loud and just kind of say,

1346
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,720
here's what I think for crash retrievals and these crashed craft,

1347
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:56,720
right now I lean more towards just a pure extraterrestrial source.

1348
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,720
Another thing I feel could be possible is that these craft, through its own AI,

1349
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,720
may be able to access psychic wavelengths themselves.

1350
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,720
What explain a lot of behaviors that people have experienced?

1351
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,720
Yeah, absolutely. Find various methodologies and kind of,

1352
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,720
I don't know what sort of wave, maybe radio waves,

1353
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,720
a frequency that can start to distort cognition and so forth.

1354
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,720
Yeah, I agree with you. I think that's a great point.

1355
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,720
I wrote it over at post-disclosure. Where can we find that, my friend?

1356
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,720
I'd love to see it.

1357
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,720
When are you going to upload the video on the glass ball that reacted to consciousness?

1358
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,720
I have uploaded that. That is the Off-World Technologies Division.

1359
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,720
Now, there is an individual that I am speaking to and that's really great

1360
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,720
that has also claimed to have observed such a thing.

1361
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,720
So I hope I have an update on that because it's very interesting.

1362
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,720
Okay, Michael, Greer does real estate as well, so he's making money with that.

1363
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,720
Not sure if he does that as much. Perfect.

1364
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:57,720
Okay, we know that besides just CE5, that Greer has other streams of income.

1365
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,720
Sorry, I wrote it over at post-disclosure, but so far no one is reading it.

1366
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,720
Hey, post it over here. Post in the Discord, man. People here, we take this seriously.

1367
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,720
People will want to read this. I promise you, man, I certainly will.

1368
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:14,720
He then talked to the CIA guy and Joe seemed like he doubted the whole UAP thing, not going to lie.

1369
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:21,720
Yeah, Mike Baker always seems to pop up whenever Joe talks to a UAP guy.

1370
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:26,720
Mike Baker, I've seen a lot of comments on Reddit and so forth saying that Mike Baker is his handler.

1371
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:33,720
I think that's hilarious. I think Mike Baker has appeared on JRE 14 times, which is a lot.

1372
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,720
So, you know, whatever.

1373
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,720
Zach, that English dude tried pretty hard to nail Lou down to no avail.

1374
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:44,720
I didn't love Lou's answers, makes it sound like he wants to stop corruption,

1375
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,720
but also won't point out what the corruption is.

1376
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,720
That's the English channel, the sort of smaller channel.

1377
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,720
Props to that guy for getting an interview with Lou. That's really cool to hear.

1378
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,720
I haven't listened to that yet, so I absolutely will.

1379
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,720
I know a couple clips of that are going around now.

1380
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,720
Spoonbending parties, isn't that Yuri Geller's claim?

1381
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,720
If I'm remembering correctly, the spoonbending.

1382
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:11,720
Why would an interdimensional capable ET race abduct humans and put implants in them to track them, et cetera?

1383
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,720
It's a very human thing.

1384
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,720
ETs don't need it and they can do it without physical contact.

1385
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:23,720
Yeah, I mean, there's so many, whenever you reach hypothesis like extraterrestrial or even ultra dimensional or something like that,

1386
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,720
there's still so many questions.

1387
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,720
I know one of my good friends who really thinks this,

1388
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:33,720
the whole phenomenon comes down to a sort of advanced planetary AI that originates from outside our solar system.

1389
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,720
He's got a lot to add here.

1390
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:41,720
I think everybody on this planet has their own UFO stories.

1391
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,720
I mean, a lot of people do.

1392
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,720
I never really talk about it because to me, just a single witness testimony, there's not much to it.

1393
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:53,720
I, of course, multiple times in my life have just seen lights in the sky making very sharp turns, not satellites,

1394
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,720
because I'm always very careful to pay attention to that.

1395
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:01,720
Bright lights that seem to make angles are kind of dart around in the sky.

1396
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,720
I don't pay too much attention because I have no confirming evidence.

1397
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,720
I have no kind of multi-sensor detection.

1398
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:12,720
But I, you know, I like, I'd say a lot of people have seen strange things in the sky.

1399
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,720
Kudos for remaining open-minded and getting into the personal infighting that plays the community.

1400
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,720
Yeah, man.

1401
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:24,720
I've noticed on Twitter, there's a lot of, a heck of a lot of drama, especially around Lou, so much drama.

1402
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,720
I don't know how you could investigate fighting like that.

1403
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,720
So I don't, I don't want to get into that.

1404
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,720
Chris Bledsoe, I don't really have an opinion right now.

1405
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,720
I'm reserving judgment for doing a deeper dive on, on Chris.

1406
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:46,720
I've heard favorable and unfavorable things about Mr. Bledsoe, but right now I do not have much, much to go on.

1407
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,720
Am I skeptical about remote viewing?

1408
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:49,720
It's highly skeptical to me.

1409
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,720
This is such a, this is a great question.

1410
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:56,720
If you asked me a couple of months ago, I'd say a lot of the woo connected with the phenomenon is like a very strange.

1411
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:04,720
Over time, just reading kind of the research papers from SRI and SAIC, listening to David Grush talk about Stargate and now Lou.

1412
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:09,720
And even people I trust like Ryan Wood even commented on remote viewing and so forth.

1413
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,720
I, I find that I, I've never observed any instance of remote viewing.

1414
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,720
I cannot do it.

1415
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,720
I don't know anybody that can.

1416
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:21,720
So I've not seen evidence, but my mind is a lot more open to it than before.

1417
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:27,720
Of course, the more you study the UFOs, the more kind of strange things and psychic phenomena get introduced.

1418
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,720
So it's, it's, it's very tough to separate the two.

1419
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,720
It's very interesting.

1420
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:39,720
And like I always say, it's a really kind of uncomfortable territory for me because I've never interacted with anybody who claims to have psionic abilities or be psychic.

1421
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,720
So I would really like to see a remote viewing demonstration if I'm being honest.

1422
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,720
Have I read loose threads by Omega point?

1423
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,720
I have not my friend, but I will write that down because that sounds.

1424
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
Any book.

1425
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,720
I will absolutely read.

1426
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,720
Thank you.

1427
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,720
The hitchhiker effect is a real thing, not just with UAP agreed.

1428
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,720
Tom Bearden explains in detail down to the equations, how to make orbs and anti-gravity craft in one of his lecturers called psychotronics.

1429
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,720
It's on YouTube.

1430
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,720
I have, I've not watched that lecture.

1431
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,720
So I, I got, I got some good homework to do.

1432
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,720
Thank you.

1433
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:12,720
Let's always the real deal.

1434
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,720
All right.

1435
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:22,720
Then I will, I will continue to research and when I spend some time to sit down with Chris, have you seen one of the new Ross cold heart reality checks with MJ 12?

1436
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,720
It gave credential to MJ 12 because of the 2022 JFK.

1437
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,720
Yes, I have.

1438
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,720
And that was with the Australian gentleman.

1439
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,720
That was fantastic.

1440
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:35,720
In my MJ 12 document, I kind of referenced it because Lou had just talked about it.

1441
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,720
It kind of really renewed interest in MJ 12 and JFK.

1442
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,720
Fantastic.

1443
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,720
Ross is, Ross does some really great work.

1444
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,720
And that Australian researcher is awesome too.

1445
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,720
That dude was recalling facts off the top of his head, like nobody's business.

1446
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,720
First, all your chain are covering the UFO flag.

1447
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,720
Hey, cool.

1448
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,720
That was forever ago.

1449
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,720
It looks to just too odd to be fake.

1450
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,720
Watch it on loop sometimes.

1451
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,720
You know what?

1452
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:03,720
Now after the claims of Lou, I'd like, and of course, Grush last year, I'd like to see some of that dang 4k satellite footage.

1453
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,720
Who would you say is the John Mack of today?

1454
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,720
That's a great question.

1455
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,720
I have no idea.

1456
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,720
I don't know if anybody is doing the serious work today that kind of John Mack did.

1457
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:17,720
John Mack was really ahead of his time, took the abduction phenomenon so seriously.

1458
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,720
I really respect John Mack's work.

1459
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,720
The Wilson Davis was pretty much known to be real.

1460
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,720
Yes, but he finally confirmed it in Facebook group.

1461
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,720
I feel bad for him because he had to take the hit on some trustworthiness with his clearance.

1462
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,720
Yes.

1463
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:35,720
I think a lot of people kind of saw the validity in the Wilson Davis memo, including the context around it and so forth.

1464
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,720
Thank you for answering.

1465
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,720
Thank you, man.

1466
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,720
I appreciate that.

1467
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,720
You take care and stay safe as well, brother.

1468
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,720
Matt, I've been in Battelle facilities in Columbus and West Jeff, Ohio.

1469
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:51,720
Do not see anything UAP related, but they def have the security and facilities to keep it hidden beyond what I could access.

1470
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:55,720
I think it's Lou who discusses now for Detrick in Maryland containing biologics.

1471
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,720
And so that's a great research avenue to go down now.

1472
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,720
Thank you so much for all.

1473
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,720
Thank you, Matt.

1474
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,720
I appreciate that.

1475
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,720
Integrity is definitely something I hold near and dear.

1476
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:09,720
I may seem kind of like an idiot sometimes, but if I'm unfamiliar with the topic or something, I don't know.

1477
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,720
I promise you, I'll always tell you if kind of my knowledge on something isn't up to snuff.

1478
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,720
I think it's important.

1479
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,720
I don't have all the answers to this.

1480
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,720
I just might be well versed in some of the cases I've covered.

1481
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,720
Shout out to I will always matter.

1482
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:29,720
The chat can get the chat can get tough to read by everybody's putting in the questions to speak to me.

1483
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,720
So I will always try to answer every single question.

1484
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,720
The sphere does sound a lot like the the bet sphere.

1485
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:44,720
What was interesting to me how this was described the sphere at this division was the sort of indent on top as if one would place a hand.

1486
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,720
But it does.

1487
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,720
It is similar to the the bet sphere.

1488
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,720
Have you seen, have you dived into eyes on cinema?

1489
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,720
Yeah.

1490
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,720
Eyes on cinema is really good.

1491
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,720
I don't know how the heck they get some of their their footage.

1492
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:01,720
I mean, they have some great stuff down to like old interviews with Ryan Wood and Dr. Robert Wood.

1493
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,720
I've never seen in my life before.

1494
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,720
I don't know how they do that.

1495
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,720
They have amazing footage.

1496
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,720
I don't know for sure, but pretty sure you can pay.

1497
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,720
You can pay to get to get on JRE.

1498
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,720
Really?

1499
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,720
That's I don't know if I'd want to go.

1500
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,720
I don't know.

1501
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,720
That'd be a fun experience, but I don't think I'm there yet.

1502
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:26,720
I know it's far from your top priority and I really appreciate that you don't chase the algorithm, but I really hope to see you get the credit.

1503
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,720
I hope so, man.

1504
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,720
That'd be really cool to kind of have a bigger platform to talk about this.

1505
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,720
But, you know, we grow, we are we are grown steady.

1506
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:38,720
We're almost at 10,000 subscribers in nine, a little less than nine months.

1507
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,720
So that's really, really great.

1508
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
And shout out Michael Herrera for being a legend.

1509
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,720
Yeah.

1510
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,720
Thank you so much, Michael, for joining the chat.

1511
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,720
If you're still here, that that's so awesome to see you in here.

1512
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,720
That English dude.

1513
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,720
You got Sean and Rob Tanner.

1514
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,720
You know, I got Sean.

1515
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:57,720
I don't even like Sean O'Malley, but sugar show is going to knock him out clean.

1516
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,720
This upcoming weekend is a treat for sports fans.

1517
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:06,720
We got one fight night Denver, which I didn't get tickets to.

1518
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,720
And then we have fight night Gilbert Burns, Sean Brady, great fight night.

1519
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,720
And then Sunday we got them Cincinnati bangles playing.

1520
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:16,720
So I'm sorry to my girlfriend, but we're watching a lot of sports this weekend.

1521
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,720
Thanks.

1522
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,720
Just email it to you.

1523
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,720
Thank you very much.

1524
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,720
I will read it either tonight or tomorrow when I catch up with my emails.

1525
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,720
Thank you.

1526
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,720
OptiV because the phenomenon is real and people within the government know this.

1527
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,720
It would be illegal for a lot of these whistleblowers to reveal too much.

1528
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,720
They go to prison and truth remain obscured.

1529
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,720
I think even the whistleblower protection act doesn't cover pensions.

1530
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,720
So even whistleblowers coming forward, there's still a very real threat to how they will

1531
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,720
provide for their family, especially after they've had a long and industrious military

1532
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,720
or kind of intelligence or USG career.

1533
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,720
I think that's a big concern for a lot of whistleblowers that's being overlooked.

1534
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:53,720
No pension security is offered here with whistleblower protection.

1535
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,720
How can we assume what NHI is capable of or not?

1536
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,720
It makes sense to me that they would use implants to do detailed monitoring.

1537
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:06,720
Yeah, of course, with NHI, non-human intelligence, it's very difficult to kind of attribute human

1538
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:12,720
traits, human thought processes or human capabilities to something that is not human.

1539
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:19,720
We know they can manipulate physics as we know it to travel almost instantaneously, accelerate

1540
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:24,720
and perform feats of acceleration and deceleration that would turn humans and our best ballistic

1541
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,720
missiles into piles of grease.

1542
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:32,720
So, yeah, to kind of assume what they're capable or not capable of is tough speculation.

1543
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:36,720
Anytime any topic gets a lot of clicks, eyeballs, you will get those who want to take advantage

1544
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,720
of it just don't be a fool.

1545
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,720
Yeah, I agree.

1546
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,720
That's why I tend not to do like news of the day type stuff.

1547
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:47,720
I like to sit back and really spend my time researching stuff and really spend my time

1548
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,720
focusing on one case at a time.

1549
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:53,720
Doing kind of the news of the day stuff, you can really get caught up in a lot of stuff

1550
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,720
and that's just not really my style either.

1551
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,720
Michael says, thank you to Pete.

1552
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,720
I'm just a guy who talked about some crazy stuff and that happened.

1553
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,720
Little did I know how much we connect the dots.

1554
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:04,720
Thank you, Michael.

1555
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,720
Mr. T. What's up, man?

1556
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:07,720
How you doing?

1557
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,720
Whitley Streber's implants given the ability to pull up information about anything in his

1558
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,720
vision while he's writing.

1559
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,720
That sounds like the eyes from the Black Mirror episode.

1560
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:20,720
Do you know the episode where the, the some husband like it gets blocked by his wife also

1561
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,720
in white Christmas?

1562
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,720
Is it true you grew up within walking distance to Lockheed in Littleton says Jim Shoe?

1563
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,720
Yes, I did.

1564
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,720
The Lockheed Deer Creek facility in Littleton was walking distance.

1565
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,720
It's nestled within the start of the Rocky Mountains right after what we call the Hogback,

1566
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,720
which is where two tectonic plates push up against each other.

1567
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,720
Rumor has it that facility goes deep into the mountains.

1568
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:48,720
I lived about a four minute, five minute walk from one of Lockheed's biggest, biggest locations.

1569
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,720
Thank you for all you do.

1570
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:50,720
I appreciate it.

1571
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,720
Thank you, my brother.

1572
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,720
I will answer any question.

1573
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,720
UFOs seem to be becoming a gateway to witchcraft.

1574
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:02,720
A lot more people are starting to kind of dive into kind of like a more woo as people call it,

1575
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,720
like a psionic stuff, psychic stuff as they talk about UFOs.

1576
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,720
It's actually really exploded this year.

1577
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,720
So I do agree with you.

1578
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,720
Have you watched the Men Who Stare at Goats?

1579
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:13,720
Great movie about remote view.

1580
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,720
I haven't seen that since it was in theaters, man.

1581
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,720
That is a good movie, Men Who Stare at Goats.

1582
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,720
I need to watch that again.

1583
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,720
I highly recommend Loose Threads.

1584
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,720
I will be reading it, my friend.

1585
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,720
I would highly recommend you watch the Joe McGonagall interview on Sean Ryan.

1586
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,720
Absolutely.

1587
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,720
I love Sean Ryan's projects.

1588
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,720
Absolutely.

1589
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,720
That sounds great.

1590
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,720
Have you noticed the sudden rise in USO stuff now?

1591
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,720
Yes.

1592
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,720
Since Timothy Gallaudet has spoken about it, there's a lot of buzz about USO.

1593
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,720
This is a great topic.

1594
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,720
I hope it really starts to get covered.

1595
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:49,720
I know a lot of guys like Green Wall or sorry, Green Street and McWest like to point to a

1596
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:55,720
new video of a transmedial concept for a Chinese drone being behind all USO sightings.

1597
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,720
But no, sir.

1598
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:00,720
We have done a couple of USO videos on this channel and some USO cases are some of the

1599
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,720
most interesting.

1600
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:05,720
I think back to Kevin Knuth at the Seoul Foundation who discussed a case where a USO

1601
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:10,720
traveled under a New Zealand destroyership knocking out all the power.

1602
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,720
I had a great conversation with this about my family the other night.

1603
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:17,720
My younger brother asked where to start and your channel, Red Panic Wallace, intro videos

1604
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,720
were my number one picks.

1605
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,720
Thank you, man.

1606
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,720
Red Panic Wallace, his documentaries are classics.

1607
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,720
Those are fantastic.

1608
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,720
They're so good.

1609
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:25,720
They're so good.

1610
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,720
Max Barr, have I looked into the gate program?

1611
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,720
Ross Colhart mentioned it in an AMA a few days ago.

1612
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:34,720
Not yet, but that is on my list of stuff to research after I finish.

1613
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:40,720
I've worked with Kecksburg in a certain private corporation that Mr. Kermit has also helped

1614
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,720
me look into.

1615
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:47,720
RV is very real and it's so easily allowable that people deny it.

1616
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,720
I really want to see remote viewing demonstration.

1617
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:56,060
I struggled with it because I've never personally been able to do such a thing or have viewed

1618
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:00,720
it, but I would really love to see situations of remote viewing.

1619
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,220
My mind is open to it.

1620
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,720
I really want to see it.

1621
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,960
Please quit your day job to do this full-time. I'd love to if the if the bills can be paid that be

1622
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:14,920
That'd be great. Do you think mj-12 could be a scythe for the us created for russia? That is the claim of

1623
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,480
Mr. John B. Alexander

1624
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,640
If you recognize if you recognize the

1625
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,160
likely reality of ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering

1626
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:30,920
It does not make sense to me to create a program for the russians to draw attention to ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering

1627
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,160
especially how

1628
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:37,800
how the majestic files reference so much of roswell and and other cases and

1629
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,440
Vannevar bush and some key players who were

1630
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:46,360
You know even outside of their association with mj-12 general nathan twining really senior us guys

1631
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,400
It seems strange to me to bring a lot of attention to them

1632
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:55,400
So maybe some documents could be but i struggle to personally see how the whole set of mj-12 documents as a whole could be

1633
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,800
Used for russian disinformation

1634
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,600
Writing you now re eric mitchell. Please keep an eye. Yes, absolutely

1635
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:08,920
What do you think of warner von bran's warning that one day will be told ufo's are a threat which happens since 2017

1636
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:17,800
Yeah, the the threat narrative that weaves in with project blue beam if if i'm correct, right a lot of people like to

1637
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,680
point to

1638
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:26,360
Reagan's speech re says i think of a world where like our nations would be united under the threat of an alien invasion

1639
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:32,280
Uh, I think it's interesting. I definitely think lu and the ttsa guys more so than somebody like grush

1640
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
kind of, um discuss the

1641
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,800
Danger of uap

1642
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:46,040
Which I I I don't really have an opinion there, but I do notice that that lu discusses more of the danger of uap and I find it very interesting

1643
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,080
Very interesting

1644
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:55,880
Do you bother with ancient text or religious references that seem like uap or strictly to docks from the last 100 years?

1645
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:01,000
No, when I when I first started talking to my friends about this because my channel first started like a huge

1646
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,200
PowerPoint for my friends

1647
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:06,040
I think it ended up being like 300 slides before I said i'm just going to make videos

1648
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,520
I prefer more time spent on individual topics

1649
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:15,240
I did reference many cases from before the past 100 years including the settings over nuremberg the 1897

1650
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,720
aurora texas supposed an incident

1651
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:21,640
Some interesting lights seen in like 1100 in jerusalem and so forth

1652
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,440
So there's a lot of really interesting sightings over the course of history the san diego sphere

1653
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:32,600
By yes, the the full like 17 video 17 minute video by it's redacted is great

1654
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,800
The san diego sphere

1655
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,200
It seems to be like a small metallic sphere with like a row of of almost like black portholes around it

1656
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:42,680
Even though there's nothing to signify there's lights, but with three or two or three almost antennae often

1657
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,640
I recommend going to watch that video. It's it's really interesting

1658
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,400
I get the feeling we maybe do for a mass public UFO sighting

1659
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,400
They just seem to have happened every decade or two within the last

1660
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:54,680
I can think of being the 2006 oh hair UFO just before smartphones

1661
01:38:54,680 --> 01:39:00,760
That'd be great if we could get something a modern day like the 1952 UFOs over washington dc. That'd be fantastic

1662
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,080
After reading loose book I'm taking a remote viewing more seriously, but I'm disappointed with russell targ's third eye spies

1663
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,080
Hopefully there are some other resources giving us a working model now. I'd like to know

1664
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,280
If you're starting to dive into the topic of remote viewing what sort of sources are you?

1665
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,360
Reading about and so forth. So I might be able to piggyback off some of that research

1666
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:26,040
I need to kind of understand more of about where to start besides just reading the research papers from sri

1667
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,520
And s a i c and stargate and so forth

1668
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:33,720
Tanner, yes, you have been here since the get go man. I remember you commenting on the first video

1669
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:37,400
So I really really really appreciate it really appreciated

1670
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,520
What topic would you introduce to joe?

1671
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:45,000
I would just want to talk about crash retrievals for like three hours to be honest

1672
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:50,840
I know we talk about many topics here, but the sort of similar to ryan wood crash retrievals is what I

1673
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:57,160
View as my bread and butter for investigation. There's nothing more that I love than looking into a crash retrieval case

1674
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:06,920
Uh sick card this week. Yeah, the the uh brady burns card is very good and also uh haggardy and superluck and Denver on one

1675
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,840
That's a great one championship. Zach

1676
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:13,480
Oh, and if you don't use it you need to get the hour breakdown of the wilson davis memo richard dolin does with mr

1677
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,960
X who I think is travis taylor they go into every single detail

1678
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:21,240
Oh, that sounds great. Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen that that sound. I would love to watch that

1679
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,880
We'll be seeing you a few years in jerry as a legitimate boots on the ground

1680
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,760
I'd love that and I'd also love to uh, you guys know joe does jiu jitsu. He's a blockbot

1681
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,440
I'd love to roll around with him a little bit joe is a short stocky man

1682
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,360
So he could probably give me some trouble on the mats

1683
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:41,720
O'Malley has grown on me. I agree, but o'malley is nasty with his striking

1684
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,480
I mean anybody but cheeto vera with a titanium skull would have gotten

1685
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:51,880
Eviscerated by that knee up the middle. O'Malley's a beast. He looks like a sideshow attraction, but he's a beast

1686
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:58,120
I will continue. I can't continue to believe youtube is effing with your channel. Come on. You should be well over 50k

1687
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,080
Do you think anyone? No, I don't want to go. I don't want to go into

1688
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:05,000
Subjects like that. Maybe it's just difficult. Maybe there's

1689
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:10,920
There needs to be over time. There will be more of a growth and interest in the uap topic. So

1690
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,880
We'll see we won't we won't go into that

1691
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,040
We won't go into that now

1692
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:20,760
Now I remember when bob lasar was on jerry. He also talked about a sphere that was an s4 when I had a dent

1693
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,120
Really, I don't remember that. I'm going to look back at that now

1694
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,880
I remember back when that uh, I think it was 2019 if I'm remembering when bob and uh, jeremy corbel went on jerry. That was awesome

1695
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:37,800
What are your views on philip j corso's claims the day after roswell is a very interesting book

1696
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:45,000
And I've been told recently by somebody very credible that I just got in contact with and I'm talking to to make specific note of

1697
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,120
What corso states uh happened with the technology gleaned off the roswell craft?

1698
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:55,160
So I'm actively pursuing some investigations off of corso's work right now if that answers the question

1699
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,280
I got to say this chat. Yeah, this chat is this chat is great. I mean we got

1700
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:05,000
Mr. Michael Herrera in the chat talking to people we've got people asking great comments

1701
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:13,240
This chat is lovely. I've been in other chats where people are just saying wild stuff. So I very very very much appreciate this

1702
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,880
Have I ever spoken to jessie michaels? Yes jessie michaels is my friend

1703
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,000
I jessie michaels is such a cool dude

1704
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:23,160
He first got in contact with him on my kingman video and

1705
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:28,200
Maybe this week I will be hanging out with jessie michaels this week or next and I can't wait jessie's awesome

1706
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:32,920
He's done so much for this subject made so many great videos. I really can't wait

1707
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:38,840
One thing about ai is that it needs to be taught constantly any chance you think the internet is how it studies us

1708
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:45,240
That would from a from an ai studying the internet would be the perfect way to kind of understand the zeitgeist of humanity

1709
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:51,240
Now would I be worried that an ai would be looking at the internet to gleam off humans and look at the memes and all the terrible things online?

1710
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,960
Absolutely, but I I think that that's very valid

1711
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,640
I I think that's a great method for even the a biological based

1712
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,880
Non-human intelligence species to simply understand humanity at a glance

1713
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,920
Michael Herrera is a legend. He is a legend

1714
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,760
That's weird timing

1715
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,160
That is weird timing. I was just listening to his

1716
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,880
Interview with william paulik the other day

1717
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,640
Uh because I found it in the files of greer that wasn't on youtube apparently

1718
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:22,680
It wasn't until paulik's death in about 2005 or 2007 that his family agreed for this to be published

1719
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:29,160
william paulik talks about deep projects including implants uh for for operators and so forth made out of a

1720
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:34,840
Facility near denver. This is a very interesting case and that's actually really weird timing. You bring that up

1721
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,240
I've never seen anybody else talk about mr. Paulik

1722
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,200
So that's great. Um

1723
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:45,080
See what a michael say thanks matt. I hope what I break open soon at some point will be legendary and help

1724
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,080
I would love that. I cannot wait to cover that

1725
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:53,240
Speaking of goats big ups to all the goats in this chat. Yeah, everybody here's amazing. Thank you for for everybody

1726
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,760
Um everybody I just joined bro. You're covering the best the best wilson davis moment majestic documents

1727
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:05,320
You know, I got a shout out to everybody that has uh kind of helped me in my investigation been there for me

1728
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:10,520
Uh, everybody has helped so much. So whether it be joey michael ryan wood

1729
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:16,440
Mr. R. A. There's so many great guys that so many wonderful people around me

1730
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:24,360
You and jesse michaels go deeper into research, uh, except for maybe richard olan jesse's video on t towns and brown is a classic

1731
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:31,240
And this video with grush is a classic jesse is awesome and jesse just watched the program too. So I am so jealous of that, dude

1732
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:36,840
You made me do it. You made me do a 180 on michael. Dude's a hero. Yes, sir

1733
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:42,440
I'm i'm loving seeing everybody. I'm loving seeing everybody be so warm to michael in the chat. That's awesome

1734
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,320
Makes perfect sense. It'll be in the ocean. I also bet millionaires in general have been expanding there. So it makes sense

1735
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:53,880
Uh, they found a magladon or something. Yeah, I've uh started starting to really shift a lot of research into uh

1736
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:59,960
Subaquatic have you ever looked into nazis going to Antarctica to advanced tech and do climate control there? Do you believe they went?

1737
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:05,720
Uh, I have been I have not like serious research, but of course I've studied the the subject

1738
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:12,040
I think there was a nazi Antarctic submarine base at the very least right and of course there was a nazi presence near

1739
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,640
Argentina and so forth. So that is a really interesting avenue of research

1740
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:22,200
I i'm not too well versed in advanced tech like if they tried to research de klok or something like that for but, um

1741
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:28,120
Yeah, interesting good words from michael. I always encourage everyone to be highly skeptical on the subject too many people

1742
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,160
Looking to make money and sacrifice morals agreed

1743
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:37,320
Do you expect to see brand new whistleblowers in the new hearing? I hope so. Um

1744
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,360
I haven't heard any rumors or anything

1745
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,960
So I don't have much to add

1746
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:45,960
But I would really like to see some uh first-hand whistleblowers. Maybe carl nel

1747
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:52,120
Uh another person maybe carl nel grush and then two new whistleblowers with first-hand experience

1748
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,360
uh

1749
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,360
Okay, let's sorry

1750
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,400
Um

1751
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:03,400
Are there uap related topics you plan to avoid indefinitely?

1752
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:11,400
Yeah, just community drama. Um, I won't really ever get into community drama. I think anything else in uap

1753
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:17,320
Deserves a serious research of investigation. Um, so really anything. I mean we were talking about earlier

1754
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,320
I even have my problems with steven greer, but

1755
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,000
I

1756
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,960
Absolutely would talk to him. I'd cover him. Uh, I'd love to do it

1757
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:29,000
I will do a deep dive on the disclosure briefing document, but yeah everything but community drama

1758
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,520
I'd I'd love to cover. I'm trying to think if there's any specific people I wouldn't cover

1759
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,520
I don't know

1760
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,520
I have to think about that

1761
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:44,200
One theory I have is that aliens are just human animal hybrids grown because the time inside the craft goes by too quickly for any normal human to test

1762
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:48,840
Human animal the human animal hybrids that is a frightening

1763
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:53,480
Thought the time inside the craft goes by too quickly. That's an interesting thought you bring up

1764
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,640
My mind is drawn to an article that was published and deleted right before the

1765
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,400
congressional hearings in july of 2023 with david crush

1766
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:05,720
It was an article written by or featuring quotes by she hand that described a craft

1767
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:10,840
That a recovery team witnessed that when they went inside the interior was as large as a football field

1768
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,040
so

1769
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:14,040
That kind of subject of uh

1770
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,000
Spatial warps with uh with craft is very interesting

1771
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,640
Very interesting. Um

1772
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,520
These are hard

1773
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:26,280
These are hard uh to investigate and proof that her era case might be easier to prove

1774
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,400
Yeah, we're still there's still so much of the um indonesia experience where we're still

1775
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,880
Really actively investigate investigating a lot there

1776
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:39,800
Thank you rattle keep up the support for greb. Thank you. I appreciate that michael

1777
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:45,880
Scott castle interviews about his us. Oh encounter is pretty interesting surprise. It hasn't gotten more attention

1778
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,880
I have not heard of that so i'm going to write that down

1779
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,920
Awesome

1780
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,160
And then in about 10 minutes we'll sign off my friends

1781
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:02,280
But we'll keep getting through these uh questions and we'll we'll continue to uh, we'll continue to go through

1782
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:08,200
I've suspected there's probably an nh i presence for a while now kevin knuth seems to think that an organism can survive in oceans

1783
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:12,440
They can hop from planet to planet in planets that just have oceans. That's an interesting theory

1784
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:15,880
Of course with uap. There's also the subject of von neumann replicating probes

1785
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:20,600
If any of you guys have heard of the channel, um john michael godier. He's really physics based

1786
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,640
He has a podcast called event horizon. Check out his channel. He always talks about von neumann probes, which is a

1787
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:32,920
A method a type of self replicating probe that even like a sub facet than light civilization could expand into the galaxy and the cosmos

1788
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,240
So yeah, a lot of interesting things there

1789
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,720
Was roswell a real ufo crash? Um, I personally think so

1790
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:46,120
I think roswell is one of the most well documented crashes and my confidence in kingman has been growing by the day

1791
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,440
Growing by the day

1792
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:53,000
Edgar mitchell was from roswell. Some of the locals told him it was real. Yes. Yes. Absolutely

1793
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:59,320
Please have mh on again the fact he's here in the chat speaks volumes when there's new breaks in the case

1794
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:05,320
Absolutely with joey as well can't leave joey out of it. Nuremberg was debunked for me personally by richard dolan

1795
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:10,040
I think he does a great job of breaking down why it's most likely not a real event interesting

1796
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,640
Interesting, okay

1797
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,120
You told us you were an engineer what kind of field mechanical

1798
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,080
But over time do less mechanical engineering more like

1799
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:24,120
Service in qa when I was in university. I was told I'd be doing really cool things with math

1800
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,680
And that was never really the case. So that's unfortunate. But that's just how it is

1801
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,800
Um, it was fun to go to school for that

1802
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:38,680
Richard dolan's wife is a noted RVer if I ever get to talk to oh eras says that as well if I talk to dolan

1803
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,560
I'd love to hear more about that. I really would I really would

1804
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,120
Let's see

1805
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,400
Let's see

1806
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:54,760
Isn't this remote viewing known as astral projection related to the meditation and getting into a dream state

1807
01:49:55,240 --> 01:50:00,120
Audits relevant here again if aliens are demonic doing remote viewing not going to be good. Yeah, I agreed there

1808
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:02,120
I think the relevance occurs just with

1809
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:07,240
Many claims now that's sort of like a almost like a conscious interface is needed for

1810
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,680
Interacting with craft and piloting craft

1811
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:15,640
But the extent of which there's some disturbing implications just like you've said

1812
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:21,720
Jimmy akin documented his participation in a remote viewing experience in progress

1813
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,880
He's not remote viewing but basically a hide-and-seek type experiment. That's interesting. I'm going to look into jimmy

1814
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,200
I

1815
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,640
Interesting thank you

1816
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:35,560
I love seeing you guys talking to um, I love seeing you guys talking to michael in the comments

1817
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,600
The half dome not a sphere. Okay. Okay

1818
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:43,240
Love course those book day after roswell. Yeah, I think that's just good reading

1819
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:48,760
You know with take it with a skeptical approach just like anything, but I think day after roswell is um, excellent reading

1820
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:50,840
excellent reading

1821
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,840
continue to think others are

1822
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,920
um

1823
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:59,880
I don't I don't know about that. I I've only ever had two people that have used

1824
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:06,280
My content, you know in the copyright tab of youtube and I they were just making like a compilation of different like testimonies and stuff

1825
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,760
That's fine. That's fine

1826
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:13,000
Jesse's interview with g han is such a banger. It's awesome. And I know he was teasing it for a while

1827
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:16,920
I remember right before he dropped it that same day a lot of people on reddit were posting

1828
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:23,560
What's happening with jessie's interview with with uh, dany protect jessie michaels. Yeah, jessie michaels is awesome

1829
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,680
The work he's doing is a sublime. It really is

1830
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,920
um

1831
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,520
Mr. T

1832
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
discuss in scalar waves

1833
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:37,800
Uh interact directly with the nucleus of an atom, which means they manipulate spacetime itself in very interesting

1834
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:43,560
Ordle chow you and jessie collab set you turn me on to this channel mh go

1835
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:45,240
um

1836
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:49,480
On jessie and I are discussing such things. We will see I will leave that to him to discuss

1837
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:55,320
Eyes on cinema has a massive library of classic ufo contents and is always adding new videos. Yeah guys

1838
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:02,520
I always recommend uh keeping notifications on for eyes on cinema just for the content they post you absolutely can't find anywhere else

1839
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,600
It's crazy

1840
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:11,720
If you were to give a skeptic friend a one to three sentence summary about why the uap ufo alien phenomenon is probably real

1841
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,680
good question

1842
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
You

1843
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,960
UFO sightings have occurred for centuries

1844
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:28,760
The u.s. Government has downplayed and lied about these sightings in the robertson panel in conden report

1845
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,280
Incredible whistleblowers have stated that

1846
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:37,000
The u.s. Government and private contractors are in possession of these materials

1847
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:42,360
Biggest emphasis on the second sentence. I don't need to think longer to get a better one. Sorry if this has been asked

1848
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:45,720
What up debat debat debabs? What is your educational background?

1849
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,360
I am not well spoken. I trip over my words all the time and blink all the dang time

1850
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:56,120
But I am a mechanical and I have a bachelors of science and mechanical engineering. So that is my background

1851
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,080
Is dan barish legit? I do not know I was going to cover him, but then um

1852
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:05,560
I think it was the night shift posted some really long stuff on it

1853
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:09,960
I haven't watched it, but I know that I think the guy's name is clint that does that channel

1854
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:13,960
I know he takes his work seriously. So I bet he's got some good stuff on that

1855
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:17,800
Um, I think he's probably he probably has a great stuff. I'll have to watch that

1856
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:24,280
Any thoughts on the physics implications of uap and the phenomenon so physics is uh, even though I'm an engineer

1857
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:31,000
This this may seem silly. I'm uh dreadful at physics like maxwellian physics was really really hard for me, but

1858
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,120
I mainly focus on the fact like um

1859
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:40,040
It's really interesting how these these crafts sort of defy physics in terms of this in their instantaneous

1860
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:45,640
Acceleration deceleration trans medial ability. It almost seems like they're about they create a

1861
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:50,200
space-time bubble around them that can dampen inertia to do such things and not splatter

1862
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:56,520
Whatever is in the craft in the craft themselves. So physics is the physics of the craft will lead that to kevin canuth

1863
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:03,320
Uh and his paper estimating flight characteristics of unidentified aerial phenomenon amazing paper highly recommend reading that

1864
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,240
But I am not good

1865
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:09,240
Interesting how the bitcoin expert predicted an uptick and disclosure activity once imminent dropped

1866
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:12,600
This includes the quiet endorsement from the wilson. Interesting. I didn't know that

1867
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:21,800
Thank you so much mr. Grover. I really appreciate that I wish you were jesse would solo or collab and amy escridge investigation

1868
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:28,280
If I do my video on mysterious deaths around uap and individuals amy escridge will 100 be in there. Absolutely

1869
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:36,680
Um, did you ever look into the am a reddit post about exo biospheric organisms from last year? Yeah, I did um

1870
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,960
I can't recall too much, but I remember that well

1871
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,440
Not well, but I remember that distinctly, but I need to um, I need to

1872
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:50,360
Re-reference that if my name is requested in the hearing. I will testify and support from those I'm working with that'd be awesome to see

1873
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,360
Michael testify awesome

1874
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:57,160
There were claims that the nazis escaped in UFOs to Antarctica if I recall correctly

1875
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:00,680
I don't know what to think about that. It's an interesting theory any theory about like a

1876
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,840
The nazi super weapons de Glock and so forth is very interesting. I personally don't have enough

1877
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:09,000
Confidence or confidence in any sort of research or backing to comment further

1878
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:11,960
Chris melan pinned a couple of your episodes. What?

1879
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

1880
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:20,040
Chris melan released a signal exchange with somebody. I think he claimed was a high up a usg or

1881
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:24,360
Intelligence communities for us and they were discussing the kingman crash. This was on twitter

1882
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:30,120
I just responded with my video because I had just covered kingman briefly earlier and it got a lot of traction

1883
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,680
So the nazi thing isn't true. I don't know

1884
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:40,600
How do you yeah, Jordan? I see I've been done enough research. So I really don't have an opinion

1885
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,960
How do you sort through the crap without chasing rabbit holes? That's a good question

1886
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:51,240
Having a baseline of research and individuals to speak to when when I'm not quite sure about something or

1887
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:59,240
Kind of just need to keep my head clear run some ideas by people, of course and euphology. There's so many rabbit holes and kind of

1888
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:01,480
crap out there

1889
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,520
and

1890
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:08,520
Just kind of weighing the pros and cons of different people's testimonies and kind of just leaving footage behind I would say

1891
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:16,360
Opinions on reptilians that she had mentioned. I think that John Ramirez has talked about that too cia former cia agent John Ramirez

1892
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:23,240
Reptilians are a scary thought. I know I think this is very different than like the David Ike reptilian subject

1893
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:29,480
That talks about reptilians being obama and other politicians, but like just a race of most reptilians

1894
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:33,640
Beans and I you know, I must approach that with an open mind

1895
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:39,080
We have robert sarbacher and vanavar bush commenting on insectoid like beans, which is very scary to me

1896
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:43,480
I'm going to look up that power. I highly recommend it. It's on the dpi archive

1897
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:50,280
Just search powellek. I think it's there. It's it's just the full raw uncut footage. I really recommend it

1898
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:55,080
I meant graze on dmt as far as I can tell they fast-tracked our evolution have been here longer than we have

1899
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:00,840
That is uh, that's interesting. That's like the the machine elves, right people describe what they see on dmt

1900
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,280
Which are these

1901
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:05,320
Strange entities. I think even alex jones has commented on that

1902
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,320
Um

1903
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:11,560
Anyone know what happened to the forechan whistleblower the document is pretty interesting now that we know a bit about more about

1904
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:14,200
us. Oh, no idea what happened to the forechan whistleblower

1905
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:18,920
I I doubt when covering it. I'll be able to track down what happened to the dude, but I

1906
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:21,800
Absolutely am going to to cover the case

1907
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:26,440
Have you looked into the manipulation of the accepted historical record?

1908
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:31,160
Is this the the theory of phantom time that about a 300 year period between like the

1909
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:37,240
High middle ages like the 1700s or like the 14 to 1700 system exist and we're actually in the 1700s

1910
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:41,800
I have I've never really looked into that, but I've always as a young as a young and I found that very interesting

1911
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:44,280
I think the subject if I'm getting it correctly is phantom time

1912
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:50,280
I meant to say I suspected there's an nh. I present the oceans for a while now. I left it. Okay. I got you. I got you

1913
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:58,200
Nuclear power uap lore is the brainchild of dr. Knuth. Maybe I should talk to dr. Knuth

1914
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,200
I haven't spoken to him in a long time

1915
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:04,280
John von Neumann also worked on the manhattan project. Yes, he did did someone

1916
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,640
Uh

1917
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:07,640
Say Richard Dolan's wife is a sub

1918
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:13,000
No, I think Richard Dolan's wife is a noted a remote viewer people were saying a noted remote viewer

1919
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:17,560
No, it's was great aliens talking. I'm used to extract DMT

1920
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:22,360
Okay, so I think somebody said that this experience was just the DMT talking and you are talking about

1921
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,920
Um actual beans you observed

1922
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:31,320
Favorite bjj move any follow and whose lineage do you follow prefer sport or self-defense?

1923
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:36,280
Now that's a great question. I am from the hegan machado lineage under nobu yagai

1924
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,280
I my favorite move. I like ripping twisters

1925
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:45,080
I have been catching blue belts with twisters almost every day now and it brings me

1926
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:51,800
Incredible joy to twister somebody you get the twister hook you either banana split them calf slice or them twister them or take the back

1927
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,080
it's is

1928
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,080
Just a very sublime experience

1929
01:58:55,400 --> 01:59:00,840
and I I would say sport because I also train mixed martial arts and uh judo

1930
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:04,440
And I have done some competing in jujitsu. So

1931
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:13,320
Self-defense is more the Gracie combatives and that I'm a large man. So I'm not a lot of people would probably try and uh

1932
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:18,200
Frankenstein choke me in the street. So mostly sports for me mostly sports

1933
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:21,560
I hope you can carry john max torch really hope you are real one

1934
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:26,920
I hope so too, man. One of my biggest passions besides crash retrieval is to speak to witnesses

1935
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,920
That's one of the biggest things. I know a lot of people

1936
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:33,240
Kind of feel uncomfortable doing that but I will go out of my way to try and speak to witnesses

1937
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:36,920
That involves cold calling and we saw how that went with witness tb

1938
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,480
We saw how that went

1939
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:43,400
Uh senior mechanical engineer for Cummins. Oh cool. My senior project in school was for Cummins

1940
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:48,520
We went to the factory in indiana. We made a spark plug durability tester. The Cummins guys are really smart

1941
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,520
very smart

1942
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:53,560
I find the varginia case very compelling. I might relate it to other

1943
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:59,080
Other cases and focus on more so the crash retrieval aspect because I know james fox already has a brilliant

1944
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,840
excellent

1945
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:03,000
piece on varginia in moment of contact

1946
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:08,360
I think russia's talked about the ufo that is way bigger when entered in one of the leak conference

1947
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:13,720
Yes, that was the wall street conference that occurred just after but the original article came out in I think june

1948
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:19,000
But he re-referenced that at that wall street speech. He gave to like 60 people that somebody leaked out some photos. Yes

1949
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:25,720
If you look up astral projections, some people report vaccine shadow people in that realm and sometimes they will hunt that sounds terrifying

1950
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:27,800
That sounds extremely scary

1951
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:31,800
Michael's story is extremely compelling. No doubt about that. I agree

1952
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:35,720
I can probably put a good word for you in Cummins. I appreciate that

1953
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:40,680
I I hope to I hope to be able to travel around full time for this someday speaking to um

1954
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,640
speaking to uh witnesses and so forth

1955
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:47,640
Opinions on reptilians same. I uh

1956
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:49,640
Approach that with an open mind

1957
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:55,240
I think there's probably a difference in the reptilians of david eich of the lizard people that are obama and hillary clinton

1958
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:59,800
Versus a type of a reptilian-esque species. I know michael schratt has

1959
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,440
Discussed this from the notes of lennard stringfield

1960
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:09,080
But same thing if robert sarbacher and vanavar bush have commented on an insectoid almost mantis like bean. I gotta keep it open mind

1961
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:12,920
Love the iceberg series. Okay. Here's what i'm thinking guys

1962
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:17,240
With lives, of course, we talked about some news today and we've had more fun

1963
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:24,360
What i'm thinking is if we do another iceberg we do it together in a live and we can um research as we go

1964
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:30,360
I'd like to keep the channel focused on investigations crash retrievals discussing witnesses and interviews

1965
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:34,280
If you guys like that and we'll find some time to do um

1966
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:37,880
Some icebergs together. I think that'd be a heck of a lot of fun

1967
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:42,120
Have you done any research on the horton brothers? I've never I have not

1968
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,440
I have not and i'm gonna write that down

1969
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:47,880
Thank you

1970
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,160
Yes, j. Allen heineck was absolutely convinced there was something to uh do this

1971
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:57,400
I love j. Allen heineck. He's very such an interesting person

1972
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,600
I've always found the fact that there were like 50 different radar recordings of the object going like five times

1973
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:09,000
Fast than anything humans had in the 60s to be very compelling. Yeah, including a verner von bran's mentor herman osberth

1974
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:14,200
A rocket scientist talking about upper bounds of ufo speed flying saucer speed being like

1975
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
30 to 48 thousand miles per hour

1976
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,400
Hackology, what's up, man?

1977
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:24,200
They're plasma powered. That's how they create clouds the clouds also camouflage. I have heard that as well

1978
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:27,640
It's sort of like an mhd plasma. I have heard that as well

1979
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:29,960
um

1980
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:36,520
Some craft are invisible to the naked eye as they affect gravity. Yes, that is one of the five observables from uh lulizondo low observability

1981
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:42,600
Could you please uh link to the paper you mentioned? Yeah, sure. Let me throw that in the chat. Uh

1982
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,960
Sorry

1983
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:51,240
That's so many flight characteristics of unidentified

1984
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:56,040
Anomalous, all right. I've referenced this a few times from kevin canuth

1985
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:59,880
But there it is in the chat if you would like to like to watch

1986
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:03,480
Okay, um

1987
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:10,520
By the way, I know the people that wrote the post on amy eskridge that blew up on reddit and they deleted it the next day

1988
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:13,480
Do you know why they deleted it the next day? That's that is interesting

1989
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:17,800
It would make sense if they utilize some gravity creating tech. Yeah, I'm

1990
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:22,760
Even bob lasar has said that back in the day. Uh, maybe we'll cover him someday. Maybe

1991
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:31,000
Let's see. Um, sorry. I'm just uh, the paulic interview was crazy the implications of them trying to implant people on a massive scale

1992
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,400
And the tech what they can do it is the paulic

1993
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:39,320
Interview is very very consequential. I would highly recommend watching that guys highly recommend

1994
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:44,440
Um, the the grays live underground so that would be similar to phil schneider's claims

1995
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:51,480
Uh, michael says no problem. Have a good night. I'm off to work in a little bit. Keep up the support and keep tuning into kerb's channel

1996
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:53,480
Yeah, guys michael

1997
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,480
works his tail off I

1998
02:03:55,640 --> 02:04:00,120
I've sometimes talked to him and it'll be like nine or ten at night and he's still at work

1999
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,760
So michael is very hardworking

2000
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:07,240
Will you start doing live streams going through ufo related info because I've seen some very interesting videos

2001
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,560
Documents and links to share with you. Yeah, absolutely

2002
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:13,480
Maybe what we could do just because I like I'm not the news of the day type guy

2003
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:17,640
I don't really care for um, like reaction type content. Maybe I know I've talked about this

2004
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,280
But I'll actually do it like once a week we can just kind of round up some

2005
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:24,200
Some news of the day discuss stuff because just as much as I want to give my opinion

2006
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:28,200
I want to hear your guys's opinion. You guys keep me grounded in my research as well

2007
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:34,760
Of course, just investigating solo can do some crazy things to your mind. So I do really appreciate every single comment you guys have

2008
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:37,000
nuclear power would merely

2009
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:42,040
Uh cover the energy output of the objects luminosity beyond that it has to be a completely different power source. Yes

2010
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,360
Uh, Richard Dolan's wife

2011
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:52,120
Uh is a lot more into the woo side and does remote viewing. They are interesting pair and complement each other well probably keeps them more balanced

2012
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:54,760
I agree. I agree Dolan. Dolan is fantastic

2013
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:59,880
I bet Davis was never under NDA about that memo. They were just pretending for whatever reason. I think yeah

2014
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:04,680
And I think it was also Edgar Mitchell now has it has been shown. He was under NDA

2015
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,800
okay, um

2016
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:15,240
That's exactly how real ets appear these days as orbs lights meteors like objects are just staying the other dimension because they are targeted with

2017
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:21,000
Scalar weapons when appeared in 3d the subject of scalar weapons in golden domes of she hand puts them to kind of

2018
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:26,200
Tech cloaked uap and bring them down is very interesting like I would definitely cover that

2019
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:28,760
Definitely cover that

2020
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:33,080
Uh, do you do these every sunday? No, but I should it's been difficult to find the time

2021
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:37,000
But if sunday's a good time that works for everybody I would I would love to

2022
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:41,880
Um, did your friends end up convincing you to try path of exile?

2023
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:44,200
No, I haven't been able to play too many games

2024
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:46,600
But what I have been playing is the black ops 6 beta

2025
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,000
So if anybody wants to play some black ops 6 when it comes out, I know that's a very casual take

2026
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:55,800
But reading so much. I need some games to just kind of melt my mind a little bit

2027
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:00,280
So if people want to play black ops when it comes out, let's do it. Let's do it live iceberg

2028
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:05,240
Okay, next week. We are doing a good, uh, a nice live iceberg. Okay guys, I'll find a fresh one

2029
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:07,640
We'll go through it. We'll have some fun

2030
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:13,400
Um, I get a coffee about the it was post-grouchy and they pulled it because concerned about family members and digging in a little too

2031
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:17,800
Yeah, the the the digging too deep can definitely be a concern or

2032
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:21,000
violating possibly violating any sort of ops sec

2033
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,240
operational security

2034
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:27,560
Is not fun. How do you find the time to go through all this do research and then do videos?

2035
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:29,480
um

2036
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,480
The research stage is

2037
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:36,360
Um is like a is a true gift. I love doing research for stuff

2038
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:41,240
Recording audio is another story and editing can be a slog

2039
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:46,600
But doing the research time flies by I could sit for 10 hours a day pouring through documents

2040
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,680
How do I find the time to do this?

2041
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:52,680
Fortunately, I have a very nice girlfriend that understands that how much this means to me

2042
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:57,480
Unfortunately, her dad is also huge into ufo. So she doesn't mind when I speak to to him about it

2043
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:00,440
Or she doesn't mind when he speaks to me about it. But uh,

2044
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:05,880
I'd say the biggest thing is efficiency and that's having a database of documents which I always try and have

2045
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:09,640
Have you ever seen the custodian file? Yeah, I have

2046
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:14,040
They've been recording u.p. He calls dragons. Yes, I have and that's that's interesting

2047
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:20,120
Again, I don't place uh too much on footage. Uh, just because there's so much footage out there and you can debate endlessly

2048
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:23,720
Uh, so I just kind of like to move on for

2049
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:26,840
Move on a little bit from footage, uh

2050
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:32,040
To me, maybe it's good to put in videos, but uh discussing it. It can just go around in circles

2051
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:37,080
Palak. Yes, watch this on the dpr archive. It was lc who brought this up super interesting

2052
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:40,600
He passed before the interview came out. This was in early 2000s

2053
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,360
I believe at like a just a middle age too, which is tragic like 50 or 60. But yeah, um

2054
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,560
So I I'd really recommend looking at palak

2055
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:55,560
I'd also recommend that you check out the study that was going on by the uh, tedesco brothers and donna nardo on long island

2056
02:07:56,040 --> 02:08:03,000
Speaking of long island, that's a I can't wait to cover the 1992 long island ufo case near brookhaven national labs

2057
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,560
So that's an interesting place

2058
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,560
Who is my favorite ufo journalist?

2059
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:12,200
Leonard stringfield and ryan wood easily easily. Those are the two best

2060
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:16,280
magic eyes only and crash retrievals parts one through seven are

2061
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,160
absolute works of art

2062
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:21,640
absolute works of art

2063
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:30,520
Oh, okay searching palak implants puts uh, no so the google the google uh dpr archive the link system doesn't work

2064
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:35,080
So if you join in the the discord, I will let me I'll post one more link

2065
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,960
I will post that uh, once I get off once I get through these

2066
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,520
Comments, I will post that

2067
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:43,880
So I'll put the palak video

2068
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:49,560
Um, thank you man. God bless you too. I love answering the questions. It's a lot of fun

2069
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,840
Okay, everybody likes. Hey, have a good labor day too. I don't know how to say your name

2070
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:55,320
I will just call you attack on titan demon

2071
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:59,480
But yeah sunday sunday is great. Everybody loves path of exile guys. Don't

2072
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:03,640
Don't don't ruin my life. It's already tough enough to get to get videos out

2073
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:09,080
Just a tip. It's european 3m. Maybe do it earlier for more views. Uh, good. Yeah, I thank you for that

2074
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:13,640
I appreciate that. I know a couple people were saying they were in the uk and that it was a bit late

2075
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:18,520
Mr. Harry, thank you very much guys. I'm gonna get through these and then we'll we'll call it a night my friends

2076
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:24,200
Counter strike 1.6 my friend. Mr. T. W. Loves counter strike

2077
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:28,280
Loves counter strike and he is trying to get me into it

2078
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:34,120
The horton brothers were a part of nazi germany and project paperclip, but they were taken by the russians. Okay, that is interesting

2079
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,680
I would like to I would like to research that

2080
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:43,800
Uh, Leonard stringfield is unmatched. Yes. Leonard stringfield is his work is just beautiful. It is beautiful

2081
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:49,240
I hope one day I can go to his archive and in Cincinnati my hometown and and look into there

2082
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:53,480
It's list on the eoc channel too. Oh the paulic videos on eoc. Cool

2083
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:59,640
The custodian file situation is basically the answer to all this the team at skinwalker ranch kept having dragons fly by in the

2084
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:03,800
Intense gravitational field would drain their battery. I think I have heard that about uh, kind of

2085
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,400
Draining their batteries. I think I have

2086
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:11,400
Have you ever read corso's original manuscript for the day after ross?

2087
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:12,120
Well, it's pretty dry

2088
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:16,360
But it makes a lot more sense than the release book the publisher added a bunch of fluff to the book

2089
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:18,040
I have that document downloaded

2090
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:24,840
But I haven't actually read it because I didn't know there was a lot of fluff that was cut out

2091
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:30,280
So is that his uh specific affidavit because I will read that that sounds awesome

2092
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:34,040
Love from australia. Hey, thanks, man. As you can tell by the poster

2093
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:37,160
I got a lot of respect for the Aussies a lot of respect

2094
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,600
Almost someone with his eric mitchell overview would prefer to send

2095
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:45,960
Via discord dm. I will keep an eye out for the request once we hang up and I'll get all that stuff going

2096
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:50,600
And with that guys, I think tonight we will call it a night everybody who's been here

2097
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:54,200
Whether it be five minutes or the whole time we've been on for two hours and 10 minutes

2098
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:59,640
Thank you guys so much. Uh, it means the most seeing everybody commented. I love it

2099
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:03,160
I don't know where I'd be without you guys. So we will plan for

2100
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:08,040
Next sunday and right now we are in the research stage of a new video. I got like

2101
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:13,080
I'd say five or six immediate videos coming out one of them

2102
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:16,520
If I can get this individual to

2103
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:22,280
Speak would be a huge video. Uh, actually two people actually three

2104
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:25,880
There's three huge leads. I'm chasing down. I'm not going to spoil anything right now

2105
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:28,600
But I really hope I can cover these because they'll be awesome videos

2106
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:34,520
And with that guys everybody have a wonderful night and I will catch you all later. Goodbye my friends

2107
