WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
It didn't start or end with Roswell. Throughout American and world history,

00:05.360 --> 00:11.680
there are numerous encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails

00:11.680 --> 00:17.520
and eyewitnesses. Today, we investigate one of these encounters that occurred during the mass

00:17.520 --> 00:26.800
UFO wave of 1952 to 1954. Let's travel to the night of May 20th, 1953, to a small town situated

00:26.800 --> 00:32.800
between Hualapa Valley and the Servant Mountain Range called Kingman, Arizona, where something

00:32.800 --> 00:40.720
perplexing and inexplicable crashed into the desert. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb. Today, I want to dive

00:40.720 --> 00:46.720
into the story of one of my all-time favorite alleged crash retrievals, the 1953 Kingman,

00:46.720 --> 00:53.200
Arizona UFO crash. This story is massively overshadowed by the Roswells of the world,

00:53.200 --> 00:59.520
yet features two extremely credible witnesses and surprising connections to our usual suspects,

00:59.520 --> 01:07.200
the AEC and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Is this crash fact or fiction? Well guys, we will do our

01:07.200 --> 01:19.280
very best to find out. The story of the Kingman crash first surfaced publicly in 1973, five years

01:19.360 --> 01:24.800
before Jesse Marcel famously told Stanton Freeman he was a part of the Roswell cover-up

01:24.800 --> 01:30.080
in order to pose with fake wreckage comprised of balsa wood and aluminum foil while the crash

01:30.080 --> 01:37.600
disc was secretly whisked away. In 1973, UFO researcher Raymond Fowler revealed shocking

01:37.600 --> 01:44.400
statements made and sworn into affidavit by a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base engineer and

01:44.400 --> 01:50.960
USAF project engineer on Operation Upshot Not Whole under the pseudonym Fritz Warner.

01:51.520 --> 01:56.880
And before we get into the story, what is this weird name Upshot Not Whole? This was a series of

01:56.880 --> 02:03.920
11 nuclear test shots conducted in early 1953 at the Nevada Proving Ground, orchestrated by none

02:03.920 --> 02:09.120
other than the Atomic Energy Commission. The objective of this project was to utilize tactical

02:09.120 --> 02:15.440
nuclear weapons to ready the US military for atomic combat. These tests even oversaw a nuclear

02:15.440 --> 02:23.280
payload shot out of artillery cannons. An estimated 18 to 21,000 DOD personnel participated in this

02:23.280 --> 02:29.680
program in 1953. Anyways, back to Warner, let's hear his story. Warner stated to Fowler he was

02:29.680 --> 02:36.640
an engineer on USAF contract with the AEC for Operation Upshot Not Whole. His job was to measure

02:36.640 --> 02:43.920
blast effects on various types of buildings constructed for the tests. On May 20, 1953,

02:43.920 --> 02:50.160
Fitz spent most of the day at Frenchman Flat. Dr. Ed Dahl telephoned Warner that evening he

02:50.160 --> 02:56.960
would be doing a special job the following day. Joined by 15 other AEC specialists,

02:56.960 --> 03:03.120
Warner reported to Indian Springs Air Force Base. There he was put on a plane to Phoenix with all

03:03.120 --> 03:08.320
of his valuables left in the custody of the military police and eventually placed on a bus

03:08.320 --> 03:14.560
with blacked out windows. During the four hour ride, an Air Force Colonel told the personnel

03:14.560 --> 03:20.800
a super secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and these specialists were sent in to investigate

03:20.800 --> 03:28.640
their speciality and theirs only. When he finally got off the bus, Fitz observed two agonizingly

03:28.640 --> 03:35.760
bright spotlights centered on a crashed object surrounded by guards. In Fitz's own words,

03:35.760 --> 03:41.920
quote, the object was oval and looked like two deep saucers. One inverted upon the other. It was

03:41.920 --> 03:48.720
about 30 feet in diameter with convex surfaces top and bottom. These surfaces were about 20 feet

03:48.720 --> 03:54.960
in diameter. Part of the object had sunk into the ground. It was constructed of a dull silver

03:54.960 --> 04:01.280
metal like brushed aluminum. The metal was darker where the saucer lips formed a rim around which

04:01.280 --> 04:07.920
were what looked like slots. A curved open hatch door was located on the leading end and was

04:07.920 --> 04:12.560
vertically lowered. There was a light coming from inside but it could have been installed by the

04:12.560 --> 04:18.080
Air Force, end quote. Warner's duty was to attempt to determine the angle from which the

04:18.080 --> 04:24.480
object impacted into the sand and how fast the vehicle was moving with forward and vertical

04:24.480 --> 04:30.880
velocities at the time. The craft had sunk roughly 20 inches into the sand and featured no

04:30.880 --> 04:38.560
landing gear and shockingly no damage. No marks or dents on the surface not even scratches. Over

04:38.560 --> 04:46.000
time Fitz estimated the craft had been traveling at roughly 1200 miles per hour and amazingly

04:46.000 --> 04:52.240
Fitz claimed to glance at a guarded pitch tent where lied the body of a dead pilot.

04:52.960 --> 05:00.160
It appeared to be a four foot tall humanoid biologic with dark brown skin and a silvery

05:00.160 --> 05:06.880
metallic looking suit. Keep this pilot description in mind. After being interviewed on his crash

05:06.880 --> 05:12.080
velocity estimations over a tape recorder, Fitz managed to speak to someone who claimed to have

05:12.080 --> 05:19.760
glanced inside the craft and observed two swivel like seats as well as numerous strange and anomalous

05:19.840 --> 05:25.760
instruments in displays. Fitz finally returned to the bus and headed back to Phoenix. The Air

05:25.760 --> 05:33.120
Force Colonel had all 16 AEC personnel swear an oath not to reveal their findings and were instructed

05:33.120 --> 05:40.640
to write their reports longhand and to not type or reproduce. There is Warner's story truly fantastic

05:40.640 --> 05:48.240
and difficult to conceptualize under just a simple pseudonym right? Well what if I told you the

05:48.320 --> 05:54.560
enigmatic Fitz Warner's identity has been revealed but first quickly let's first review the

05:54.560 --> 06:01.120
affidavits signed by Fitz with Raymond Fowler as witness. This excerpt of the affidavit is from

06:01.120 --> 06:07.040
Fowler's book Casebook of a UFO Investigator under the section Crash Retrievals of the Third Kind.

06:08.480 --> 06:14.000
I, Fritz Warner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with the U.S. Air Force on

06:14.000 --> 06:20.480
May 21st, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a crashed unknown object in the vicinity of

06:20.480 --> 06:27.040
Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembled brushed aluminum.

06:27.040 --> 06:32.560
It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign of structural damage. It was oval and

06:32.560 --> 06:38.240
about 30 feet in diameter. An entranceway hatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was

06:38.240 --> 06:43.200
about three and a half feet high and one and a half feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with

06:43.200 --> 06:49.440
someone on the team who did get a look inside only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin,

06:49.440 --> 06:53.920
and a lot of instrumentation and display. A tent pitch near the object sheltered the

06:53.920 --> 06:59.680
dead remains of the only occupant of the craft. It was about four feet tall, dark brown complexion,

06:59.680 --> 07:05.520
and had two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, and a small round mouth. It was closed in a silvery

07:05.520 --> 07:10.560
metallic suit and wore a skullcap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering

07:10.560 --> 07:16.080
her helmet. I certify that the above statement is true of fixing my signature to this document

07:16.080 --> 07:22.960
on this day of June 7, 1973, signed Fitz Warner, witnessed by Raymond E. Fowler.

07:23.600 --> 07:30.240
Fitz's identity was later on revealed and confirmed by Fowler as one Arthur Stancell Jr.

07:30.800 --> 07:39.040
Now, quite often his name is spelled S-T-A-N-C-I-L, which is incorrect in a confusion. It's S-T-A-N-S-E-L.

07:39.680 --> 07:44.800
But anyway, Stancell's background and credentials can be directly confirmed.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.440
Stancell began his career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at that time, Wright-Patterson

07:49.440 --> 07:57.280
Airfield, serving as a USAF aircraft engineer, test mechanical engineer for the Air Material Command

07:57.280 --> 08:03.200
after honorably taking part in the D-date landings of World War II. Arthur was additionally working

08:03.200 --> 08:08.560
at the Nevada Proving Grounds on May of 1953 when the crash occurred, specifically studying the

08:08.560 --> 08:14.240
effects of atomic blast on structures, as Fitz stated, and this was during Operation Upshot

08:14.240 --> 08:20.160
Knot Hole. To add even more credibility to Stancell, the engineer also worked on aspects of the

08:20.160 --> 08:27.200
Manhattan Project and for 16 years on the Apollo program. Huge thanks to Richard Geldrick Jr. for

08:27.200 --> 08:32.400
doing the digging on Stancell as you'll find in his linked medium article. So unlike some more

08:32.400 --> 08:38.480
controversial figures in ufology like Bob Lazar, we can in fact verify the background of Wright

08:38.480 --> 08:48.800
Pat, the AEC, and aircraft testing with Stancell. Let's start to break down and analyze the context

08:48.800 --> 08:56.480
of some of Stancell's claims. Remember first, his story came out in 1973 and 1978 was when

08:56.480 --> 09:01.840
Marcel revealed the truth of the Roswell cover-up. We can definitively rule out this accomplished

09:01.840 --> 09:07.280
engineer was just writing the coattail of the Roswell crash. Within Stancell's testimony,

09:07.280 --> 09:12.400
he mentions the night before viewing the wreckage receiving a phone call to report by one doctor,

09:12.400 --> 09:18.720
Ed Dahl, who was in fact a project director and physicist for Operation Upshot Knot Hole

09:18.720 --> 09:23.920
at the Nevada Test Site. Unfortunately, Dahl has long since passed and no statements were

09:23.920 --> 09:30.000
ever made by him about this alleged crash retrieval. However, there is another man with possibly even

09:30.000 --> 09:35.040
deeper connections to UFO crash retrieval. During his time working as an engineer at

09:35.040 --> 09:41.600
Wright Field from 1949 to 1960, Stancell worked in what was known as the Air Material Command

09:41.600 --> 09:48.880
Installation Division within the Office of Special Studies headed by Dr. Eric Wang. Dr. Wang was an

09:48.880 --> 09:54.480
Austrian-born graduate of the Vienna Technical Institute. In 49, Wang became the director of

09:54.480 --> 09:58.640
the Department of Special Studies at Wright Patterson where he worked with scientists from

09:58.640 --> 10:06.400
the Office of Naval Research and Dr. Vannevar Bush, who has some connections to the UFO phenomena

10:06.400 --> 10:11.200
and others from the Research and Development Board. Dr. Wang relocated his research from

10:11.200 --> 10:16.640
Wright Field to Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico around the time of Operation

10:16.640 --> 10:23.120
Upshot Knot Hole. Tracking down record of Wang has proven to be extremely challenging. However,

10:23.120 --> 10:27.520
direct proof can be found of his role in the Department of Special Studies in the actual

10:27.520 --> 10:33.120
DOD operation Upshot Knot Hole unclassified document. The importance of determining Wang's

10:33.120 --> 10:40.400
credentials cannot be understated, seen as Wang is a figure in UFO lore suspected of having deep

10:40.400 --> 10:46.000
ties to reverse engineering and crash retrievals around this time. More investigating needs to be

10:46.000 --> 10:52.960
done here, but Wang allegedly led reverse engineering efforts under Kissinger. Wang was known to be a

10:52.960 --> 10:59.520
close associate of Victor Schauerberger, an operation paperclip scientist who developed

10:59.520 --> 11:05.920
concepts for flying discs for the Nazis. Wang, of course, is not the focus of today's video. Neither

11:05.920 --> 11:13.920
is Dahl, but Stansel serving under both Wang and Dahl to an extent during the 1953 crash is of note.

11:14.800 --> 11:25.760
Three months after the alleged Arizona crash in 1953, the USAF issued Regulation 200-2,

11:26.400 --> 11:32.880
which required all UFO reporting to be sent to USAF Intelligence and not Project Blue Book,

11:32.880 --> 11:39.360
the official USG investigation group at the time. This directly stovepiped UFO reporting leading to

11:39.360 --> 11:44.000
fewer credible reports making their way to Congress and the American people, fueling the

11:44.000 --> 11:49.280
growing UFO stigma. I talked about this a lot in my Stigma video, go check that out. If you watched

11:49.280 --> 11:53.680
my history on the UFO stigma, you will know the Robertson Panel was conducted to quell public

11:53.680 --> 12:01.120
interest in UFOs, and was commenced in January of 1953, four months before the Kingman crash.

12:01.760 --> 12:06.720
While Regulation 200-2 most definitely relates to the Robertson Panel,

12:06.720 --> 12:13.280
it is quite plausible to suspect that restricting UFO reporting was to keep a tight lid on previous

12:13.280 --> 12:18.560
and future crash retrievals like the Kingman Arizona crash and possibly Roswell. Also,

12:18.560 --> 12:23.840
a key piece here is the AEC's connection to Upshot Knothole and the Kingman crash.

12:23.840 --> 12:30.240
As my community can probably recite by heart, the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement has been used to

12:30.240 --> 12:37.120
misclassify UFO material as quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear material to avoid declassification

12:37.120 --> 12:44.560
and restrict information to need to know basis. The 2024 NDAA Schumer legislation directly states

12:44.560 --> 12:51.040
the 54 Atomic Energy Act has been used by DOD and legacy programs to protect UFO program records

12:51.040 --> 12:56.480
and materials. And while we're at it, let's not forget the testimony of Lieutenant Robert Jacobs

12:56.480 --> 13:01.760
and Robert Salas of Maelstrom Air Force Base. If you have not seen my video on UFOs and nukes,

13:01.760 --> 13:07.680
I highly recommend watching to understand this anomalous connection of UFO to nuclear weapons.

13:07.680 --> 13:13.920
So the idea a UFO is active near the Nevada test range after 11 nuclear warheads were detonated

13:13.920 --> 13:24.240
in 1953 is far from surprising. Shockingly, Stansel was not the only credible whistleblower

13:24.240 --> 13:30.320
to make claims about the Kingman crash. Meet the under-the-radar alleged UFO reverse engineering

13:30.320 --> 13:36.160
whistleblower Bill Uhouse. Uhouse was featured on Stephen Greer's disclosure project in October

13:36.160 --> 13:42.880
of 2000 and made some astounding claims. Uhouse was a former mechanical engineer and 14-year

13:42.880 --> 13:48.960
USMC vet retired at the rank of captain with a history of flight testing of exotic experimental

13:48.960 --> 13:54.000
aircraft at Wright Pat. While working for a defense contractor and Wright Patterson Air Force

13:54.000 --> 14:00.960
Base, Uhouse claimed to work as a pilot and design engineer for a flying disk simulator.

14:01.520 --> 14:07.280
The simulator, according to Bill, became operational in 63 to 64 and was based off

14:07.280 --> 14:11.920
a recovered disk retrieval. And you can probably guess the crash he names.

14:12.320 --> 14:22.160
As I watch, the reason why I'm saying this is because the simulator wasn't actually functional

14:22.160 --> 14:30.960
until around 1958 where the simulator was actually operable. The simulator that they used or the

14:32.080 --> 14:37.920
craft that they used to build, which is a 30-meter one, was the one that the crashed in

14:38.720 --> 14:48.000
Arizona, Kingman, Arizona, back in 53 or 52, I think it was 53.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.760
According to Uhouse, the craft was taken to Area 51 slash the Groom Lake facility

14:53.760 --> 14:59.280
and the dead pilots were taken to Los Alamos, part of the AEC. Gotta mention, Uhouse also

14:59.280 --> 15:03.600
makes numerous other statements including touching on a recovered extraterrestrial

15:03.600 --> 15:08.400
humanoid codenamed J-Rot. However, this of course is not the subject of our video.

15:09.200 --> 15:14.400
Because Uhouse is making such high-profile claims and disclosing through Greer, he must

15:14.400 --> 15:20.160
be riddled with red flags, no? Guys, I have to do this myself too, but let's start removing

15:20.160 --> 15:26.240
whistleblowers from the stain of Greer and everything he touches. While Greer himself

15:26.240 --> 15:31.760
is egotistical, money-driven, and very problematic, he has platforms numerous

15:31.760 --> 15:37.680
incredible individuals to tell their tales, including Wagan, Uhouse, Herrera, Bushman, etc.

15:38.240 --> 15:42.880
One common thing you will learn from the men with incredible stories, they only disclosed

15:42.880 --> 15:48.800
through Greer because they knew no other route, and many, like Herrera, have regretted going

15:48.800 --> 15:54.560
through Greer. Anyways, Uhouse worked on a flight sim based off the 53 crash disc.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.360
These claims are far too crazy to be taken seriously when we cannot verify a man's

15:59.360 --> 16:03.920
credentials, who discloses through Greer similar to Don Phillips. Thanks again to the

16:03.920 --> 16:08.640
investigation done by Richard Gelderich Jr., Uhouse's storied history in the Marine Corps

16:08.640 --> 16:15.840
can be indeed verified. Remember, Uhouse claims 14 years in USMC services, 10 years in the Corps,

16:15.840 --> 16:20.160
and 4 years working with USAF in private industry on experimental testing.

16:20.160 --> 16:25.760
In this clipping from March 3, 1949, we can see proof of William G. Uhouse's re-enlistment with

16:25.760 --> 16:32.240
the Corps after previous USMC service, and again on the 30th of March, 1953. We can see in the

16:32.240 --> 16:38.320
evening times a newspaper article on Uhouse, this article confirms 8 years in USMC service,

16:38.320 --> 16:44.320
and tours in Korea for Uhouse, and importantly shows Bill's demonstrating capabilities of the

16:44.320 --> 16:50.080
Second Engineers Battalion. Bill's role in the Second Engineers Battalion was also confirmed

16:50.080 --> 16:55.360
in the service company report. And lastly with Uhouse, it's just kind of important to note

16:55.360 --> 17:01.520
in this How and Why article, it's stated Uhouse was invited by a man from Link Aviation,

17:01.520 --> 17:06.800
a simulator manufacturer company, to aid in the building of the F-102 simulator,

17:06.800 --> 17:12.160
B-47 simulator, and later on the flying disc simulator based off the Kingman crash.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.480
And quickly, I just want to cover some additional witnesses to this case who

17:20.480 --> 17:27.600
vary wildly in believability and credibility. In 1997, Leonard Stringfield, a respected UFO

17:27.600 --> 17:32.160
researcher, was approached by a pilot after a lecture at the Lunken Airport in Cincinnati,

17:32.160 --> 17:38.240
Ohio. The pilot claimed to have been present at the crash site in 1953 and gave a recount of the

17:38.240 --> 17:43.600
biologics recovered that was very similar to Stansel, around four feet tall, large eyes,

17:43.600 --> 17:51.840
brown skin on face, and silvery metallic suits. And in 1994, another man codenamed JLD approached

17:51.840 --> 17:57.760
Stringfield, making similar claims about the crash but died shortly after. The glaring red flag of

17:57.760 --> 18:04.000
these unnamed and unaccredited sources came from one Judy Wolcott, who claimed to UFO researcher

18:04.000 --> 18:09.920
Don Schmidt, her husband, a Vietnam conflict officer, wrote to her saying he had been present

18:09.920 --> 18:16.320
at a UFO crash retrieval in Kingman, Arizona, where biologics had been recovered. Wolcott

18:16.320 --> 18:22.560
claimed her husband unfortunately was killed by NVA in the war. Wolcott was ousted by author Nick

18:22.560 --> 18:28.800
Redfern, who discovered that her events absolutely did not add up. Her husband had not died in Vietnam,

18:28.800 --> 18:34.800
and her own daughter stated Judy often lied and made up stories. Whether this was an attempt at a

18:34.800 --> 18:41.120
claim to fame or purposeful disinformation, we do not know. However, her case and testimony and

18:41.120 --> 18:47.040
the falsity of it is worth mentioning. What's going on guys? I hope everybody enjoyed this

18:47.040 --> 18:52.880
look into the Kingman, Arizona UFO crash. This case is of course severely overshadowed by its

18:52.880 --> 18:59.120
older brother at the 1947 Roswell crash, so little attention is paid to this case. I think it's

18:59.120 --> 19:03.680
incredibly interesting where things get hairy for me like most cases because I do tend to focus on

19:03.680 --> 19:12.080
nuts and bolts with my videos is the biologics. The 4 foot tall humanoid looking creatures with

19:13.120 --> 19:19.840
brown faces and silvery metallic suits, it gets strange. One theory I've heard to debunk this

19:19.840 --> 19:25.680
case, which is very strange for me, is USAF secretly testing aircraft and biologic effects

19:25.680 --> 19:31.680
when flying through nuclear clouds. So aircraft were remote controlled and chimpanzees were put

19:31.680 --> 19:38.720
in suits and crashed and killed. This of course doesn't explain the craft resistance to deformation

19:38.720 --> 19:44.720
at 1200 miles per hour, as Stancil said, but that's one of the funny debunks I've come to see.

19:44.720 --> 19:50.960
What do you guys think about the Kingman crash? If you're from Arizona and from the area and

19:50.960 --> 19:56.560
there's some more lore to this case that I am not hearing about, let me know. I'd love to hear from

19:56.560 --> 20:01.200
you guys some people boots on the ground from the actual area, so sorry for the long break guys,

20:01.200 --> 20:05.440
