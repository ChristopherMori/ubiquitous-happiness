1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
It didn't start or end with Roswell. Throughout American and world history, there are numerous

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,020
encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails and witnesses.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,040
And sometimes, these trails get messy. Details, records, and facts of one case may be confused

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,080
with another, making it difficult to fully analyze the stories of these fascinating

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,880
retrieval efforts. This is especially true for two cases along the arid desert border of Texas and

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,160
Mexico. What's up guys, it's UAP GERP. Thank you so much for joining me today as we are going to

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,440
cover a region of Texas near the Texas-Mexico border named Del Rio that experienced not one,

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,120
but two alleged UFO crash and recovery operations during the 1950s. Over the years,

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,280
these two cases have almost molded into one, but due to their insanely interesting stories and

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,400
astonishing connections to ufology, each deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens. Are these

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,360
cases fact or fiction? Join me today as we investigate to find out.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:19,680
In June of 2018, Dr. Eric Davis was interviewed by journalist George Knapp on Coast to Coast

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,920
AM. And yes, this is the same Eric Davis from the Wilson Davis memo whose scientific pedigree

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,080
cannot be understated. When the two legends of ufology begin discussing UFO reverse engineering

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,080
efforts, the doctor states, quote, Yeah, they've got, I would say, you know, if you're going to throw

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,680
your bets on Roswell, your bets really good. Del Rio, Texas, that was a 1950s case. That was

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,360
another one. And the other ones I won't bring up because those are still classified. Researching

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,200
the highly disputed MJ 12 documents leads us to another clue surrounding the Texas-Mexico border.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
Following the description of the Roswell case in the Eisenhower briefing document,

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,560
the alleged MJ 12 document to brief the president incumbent highlights a case from the 6th of December

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,240
1950. This case saw a UFO of similar origin to Roswell impact the earth at high speeds

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,960
along the El Indio area of the Texas-Mexico border. The craft impacted at such high speeds,

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,400
it was nearly obliterated when the search team arrived. The recovered materials were transported

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,040
to the atomic energy commission facility at Sandia, New Mexico for study. Okay, pretty cut and dry,

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,560
right? El Indio is 75 miles southeast of Del Rio. So it makes sense to use this as a

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,960
reference point, right? But there is another case that occurred in 1955 that researchers

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,280
additionally use the Del Rio area as a reference point. The Colonel Robert Willingham crash retrieval

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,200
case near Langtree, Texas. There are a number of huge factors separating these cases we will cover

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,040
later in the video. But lack of study of these two cases has led to egregious misidentification

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,200
between the two. So let's take a step back and analyze each case.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,560
Colonel Robert Burton Willingham served honorably in World War II in Korea.

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,160
His distinguished career saw him within the US Army, Air Force, Air Force Reserves,

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,560
and civilian air patrol. Serving in the US Air Force during Korea,

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Willingham claims to have received a purple heart for his severe wounds suffered to his

35
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,560
leg and head when hit by a mortar shell and a foxhole. I use the word claims here very deliberately

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,000
because I have not been able to verify any receiving of his purple heart. Now it is worth

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,840
mentioning there are some respected ufologists like Kevin Randall in his book Crash where UFOs fall

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,000
from the sky who doubt or call into question Willingham's Air Force service record. And this

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,960
is because the National Personal Record Service in St. Louis, Missouri was unable to provide his

40
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,680
service record. However, what is worthy to note on July 12, 1973, there was a fire in this building

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,440
that destroyed most military records for personnel serving between 1947 and 1963. Now the author

42
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,200
Noah Torres has stated he has over 50 documents to prove Willingham's Air Force service, but

43
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,040
I have yet to see these documents. These injuries saw Willingham unable to return to combat,

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,120
where he then returned to Texas as an Air Force Reserve pilot. On a spring day in 1955,

45
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,240
the Colonel and Reserves were running a Cold War simulation mission where Willingham and other

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,280
F-86 aviators assisted B-47 and B-52 bombers. It is on this mission, Robert claims to have

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,680
experienced a crashed UAP. Before we get started, I would like to immediately cite my primary sources

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,120
and discuss the history of Willingham coming public. I will primarily be pulling from the 2008

49
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,400
book The Other Roswell UFO Crash on the Texas Border written by Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,280
due to the author's personal work and interviews with Robert near the end of his life in 2015.

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,080
Robert first went public with his story in 1965, featured in a Pennsylvania weekly newspaper called

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,560
Mechanicsburg. An article asking civilian air patrol pilots about UFO counters first oversaw

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,480
the Colonel's story. 12 years later, researchers found clippings of this article in the NICAP,

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,080
the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon, lost in the annals of NICAP's files.

55
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Researcher Todd Zechel tracked down Willingham and made him sign an affidavit. And I do have to

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,280
point out the inaccuracies between this article and the affidavit versus the other Roswell book I

57
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,440
am referencing. In this article from 67 and affidavit from 77, Willingham states he was flying

58
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,960
in F-94. He goes on to say in the other Roswell book he was actually flying an F-86 Sabre.

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,120
In the article, he claims his experience happened in 1948, but in the book and other sources,

60
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Willingham claims to have seen the UFO in 1955. This he blames on a faulty memory due to the

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,320
head injury he sustained in Korea, but this to me does in fact hurt Willingham's credibility.

62
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,920
On a spring day in 1955, the Colonel and other F-86 aviators escorted B-47s for a Cold War

63
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,080
simulation training exercise from the Carswell AFB. It's worth noting Willingham's serial number

64
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,360
and call sign CD195 and Willie Eddy. The missions served to escort the bombers in their Texas leg

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,720
of their New York to Texas to Washington state journey. Willingham stated the squadron had received

66
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,080
intelligence by radio that fast-moving unidentified signatures had been picked up by the distant

67
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,240
early warning radar systems, dues, located in Canada. These signatures were moving south towards

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,640
Texas. During the mission, the pilot of the B-47 radioed in about an unknown aircraft picked up on

69
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:10,000
radar moving south from the northwest. Willingham then saw a bright big object like a star coming

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,560
his way. The object approached within 35 to 40 miles of the USF regiment at an estimated speed of

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,920
2,000 miles per hour. This was an estimate by Willingham because the craft seemed to go four

72
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,160
times the speed of its F-86, which traveled at 685 miles per hour. Willingham described the

73
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,320
brightly lit surface, quote, like magnesium steel. Other pilots, including George Smithson,

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,000
stated they had also seen the craft in a post-incident debrief. The object made a 90-degree

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,520
turn headed southwest towards the Mexican border. Shortly after the turn, the object was seen to

76
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,480
emit, quote, a lot of sparks, and it tilted down at about a 45-degree angle. The colonel wondered

77
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,600
if this was due to the abrupt turning maneuver causing hull damage. The object fell out of view

78
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,600
and the colonel assumed it had crash-landed just west of Del Rio. Now quickly, there is no report

79
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,720
of this sighting in 1955. However, we can look to the Condon Report I spoke of in my stigma video,

80
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,760
which was created specifically to push the UFO stigma. Case 5 of the report lists a military UFO

81
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:25,120
encounter from 19 September 1957, also from Carzwell Air Force Base in Fort Worth. In this

82
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,360
recorded encounter, a large bright fireball alternating red to white chased a USAF RB-47

83
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,680
for more than 600 miles. The object was seen by flight crew, detected by Carzwell radar,

84
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,120
and picked up by the RB-47's radar. Interestingly, the equipment for electronic

85
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
countermeasures and reconnaissance aboard the RB-47 registered the UFO emanating a strong

86
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,040
radar signal of 2800 megacycles. Quoted from the Condon Report from pilot Louis D. Chase, quote,

87
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Before any evasive action could be taken, the light crossed in front of the plane,

88
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,680
moving to the right at a velocity far higher than airplane speeds. The light was seen by pilot

89
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,960
and co-pilot and appeared to the pilot to be a glowing body as big as a barn, end quote. The

90
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,280
Condon Report shockingly detailed how the ECM, graphic, and radar data were all removed upon

91
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,120
landing by intelligence personnel. Onscreen now is the original CIA report of this incident.

92
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,960
Anyways, back to Willingham. Familiar with the area, Robert estimated the crash to be

93
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,400
in Langtree, Texas. He radio Denver flight controller, requesting permission to fly to

94
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,360
the estimated crash site. Denver replied, quote, Yes, go check out what it was and where it hit.

95
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,480
We want to know where it was, too, end quote. Willingham approached Langtree from San Angelo

96
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,800
and brought his F-86 down to an altitude of near 800 feet. It was here he observed the wreckage of

97
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,240
a disc-shaped craft, which collided with the ground just south of the Rio Grande on the Mexican

98
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,120
side of the border. The craft had seemingly collided and skidded 300 feet across the ground.

99
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,240
The colonel returned to mission and formulated a plan to visit the site privately when he returned

100
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,600
to base. The colonel arrived to Corsicana Airfield, met his friend, and prepared to depart to the

101
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,320
wreckage in a 1947 Erronka Champion. Willingham's friend slipped under the radar and faced no

102
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,680
reprisals for this incident. His name was later revealed after his death in 2002, as Jack Perkins,

103
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,000
a Pennsylvania electronics engineer who served in the Civil Air Patrol with Robert.

104
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,040
Before we go on to the crash, there may be just a little more to Willingham's story than meets the

105
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,400
eye. This unclassified document from the 18th of July, 1955, just months after Willingham's encounter,

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,920
details a response request from USAF Captain Ladi Marin to a request from the commander of

107
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,720
USAF Security Services in San Antonio. The commander was requesting for data on UFO sightings from

108
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,760
NEAC, the Northeast Air Command, and Northwestern United States specifically from B-47 jets.

109
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,160
This could very well be coincidence, but it is interesting how a USAF commander in San Antonio

110
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,440
of all places was interested in B-47 UFO encounters right after Robert's sighting.

111
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,800
And we do have another very relevant case from spring the year before Willingham's encounter,

112
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,320
1954. On May 14, 1954, a flight of marine reserve jets led by Major Charles Scarborough

113
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,360
flew about six miles west of Dallas, Texas. The team spotted 16 unidentified signatures

114
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,080
in groups of four. Pilot Scarborough and Jorgensen attempted to box these UFOs alternating between

115
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,560
white to orange, similar to our other two cases. The signatures accelerated away rapidly at high

116
00:11:50,560 --> 00:12:01,360
speeds evading the Marines. Perkins and Willingham reached the crash area at about 4 p.m. The object

117
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,960
had broken off into roughly three sections with debris strewn everywhere. The object appeared to

118
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:14,000
be dome-shaped, 12 to 15 feet in length, resting 50 feet beyond the main body of the UFO. The main

119
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,200
body appeared to be a flattened disc, 20 to 25 feet in diameter, split into two larger pieces.

120
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,960
Half the disc was embedded into a sandy mound. While touching down, the two noticed Mexican

121
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,720
soldiers, jeeps, and cars formed in a perimeter around the crash site. The two men approached

122
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,080
the site and observed many pieces of debris, quote, there were lots of pieces of debris,

123
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,840
some little and some large chunks about as big as a good sofa chair. Willingham noted the

124
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Mexicans were not attempting material gathering or retrieval effort of any kind. No trucks or

125
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,480
airplanes were at the scene. The soldiers appeared to be simply standing perimeter on the site.

126
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,240
After touching down quite a distance from the wreckage, Mexican soldiers approached the two men.

127
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,360
One of these, an officer named Lieutenant Martinez from Mexico City, noted Willingham's

128
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,480
use half fatigues and offered to take him near the site. But without Perkins, Martinez told Robert,

129
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,040
we can't let anyone close to it. The American Air Force will be here very soon to clean this

130
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,800
all up. Now, Willingham assumed the military men were from the closest army base, Ciudad Acuna,

131
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,920
around 100 miles away. I have not been able to track down any record of a Lieutenant Martinez

132
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,720
here. But according to Willingham's story, the Mexican government was simply guarding the wreckage

133
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,720
for an American crash retrieval team to show up. This is a process claimed that pops up relatively

134
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,560
often, such as the 1978 Bolivia crash retrieval I talked about in my Moondust video, which saw

135
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Bolivian authorities alerting American military to inspect the downed UFO. When departing the

136
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,360
wreckage, Willingham decided he would not leave without evidence of the crash, so he grabbed a

137
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,360
small piece of shiny metal debris. Upon returning to base, Willingham submitted an oral and written

138
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,200
report to Reserve Commander Colonel Miller and soon received threats not to discuss his sightings,

139
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,840
warning of consequences. One General in USAF Intelligence told him, quote,

140
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,040
Don't say anything about what you saw down on the border.

141
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,240
The material Willingham possessed was rigid, unyielding, but extremely light, and grayish

142
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,280
silver in color. It reminded him of magnesium steel, small honeycomb patterned holes lined the

143
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,600
side, which the Colonel figured was to dissipate heat. There was no inscription, symbols, or

144
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,280
characters on it, unlike the Roswell material. This material shares little resemblance to the

145
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,080
shape memory alloy found at Roswell and likely studied by Battelle Memorial Institute.

146
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,160
Willingham tried to test the piece's material properties through a series of deformation tests,

147
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,120
including torch cutting, all to no avail. According to Willingham, he possessed the

148
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,160
material for four days, but in his haste to study the material took no images.

149
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,560
The Colonel sent the fragment to USMC Metallurgy Lab in Hagerstown, Maryland.

150
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,560
A USMC major received the material and was perplexed by the structure. Willingham gave him

151
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,240
his number and address to receive the piece back. Some time later, Willingham contacted the lab to

152
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,680
talk to the major. He was told no such person had worked there, nor did they know anything about

153
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,080
this mysterious metal. There were no records of tests. He attempted to pursue the chain of command,

154
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,920
but was told it would be in his best interest not to pursue the matter further. While Willingham's

155
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,240
story may be suspect here regarding the materials, what is undeniable is the fact USG did in fact

156
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,000
partake in the study of UFO materials. Even if you discount the Battelle-Roswell connection,

157
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
we can analyze Project Moondust, tasked with recovering foreign space vehicles and UFOs,

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,800
or the 1966 CIA memo titled, Exploitation of Metallic Fragment from Unidentified Flying

159
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,840
Object, which discusses material from a fallen UFO recovered in the Congo.

160
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,680
Now, this is one of the most troubling aspects of this case for me. In the other Roswell,

161
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,840
there is a specific chapter on alien bodies. No mention of NHI is made here, quote,

162
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,280
I never saw bodies. I was not able to get close enough and I don't know what happened after I

163
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,720
left, end quote. Willingham reasons the most likely place for bodies, if there were any,

164
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,880
would be under the dome shaped section of the craft. However, on a July 24th, 2012 interview

165
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,520
with Jeff Rents, Willingham specifically states he saw bodies. Yeah. Okay, so the front of the

166
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,400
craft that impacted the ground ripped a hole open inside and apparently people could see in there

167
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,720
and there were dead ETs or they weren't humans, there were dead bodies in there of some kind.

168
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
Right, right. And you couldn't get around there to see in there either.

169
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,640
Well, I kind of snuck around. You're a sneaky fella, aren't you? All right, now tell

170
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,880
you snuck around there a little bit, Colonel. What did you see? Well, it didn't look like

171
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,360
human beings to me. How many of them were there? I believe there were three and the

172
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,360
lieutenant said there were four. All right. I never did see the other one. Were the bodies

173
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
mangled or were they relatively intact and what were they dressed in?

174
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,600
Well, they weren't dressed at all. Okay. And they were in a lot of different pieces. I didn't see

175
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:55,520
but one that had a complete top. But I wouldn't swear what he was eating. All right. What did the

176
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,920
head look like? Anything like we've seen in the common research literature, the big eyes,

177
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,640
the smooth skin or the little mouth. Did you see anything? Yeah, some of them that looked like that.

178
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,400
They just, I don't know how you explain it, but they just, their heads and arms and stuff,

179
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,600
their arms are a little bitty. They look like boomsticks.

180
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, okay. But they had a big room stick. All right. No, no, I got you. They had no uniform on.

181
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,400
They were just basically skin if that's what their outer covering is. The point of bodies

182
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,400
is reiterated in the 2023 presentation given by author of the book, Noah Torres, who additionally

183
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,920
mentions bodies. Was this poor reporting in the book? I don't think so because Willingham is

184
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,760
specifically quoted as not seeing bodies. I will absolutely not fall back in an argument that

185
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,120
Willingham's memory in old age was failing him, causing him to remember details poorly.

186
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,800
This is the argument he uses as to why some small inaccuracies exist in his affidavit,

187
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,840
like the type of plane he was flying. I have reached out to Noah Torres for more comment on the bodies

188
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,640
because as of now, this is a massive issue in Willingham's credibility.

189
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,680
We do have an independent witness who can bring some interesting details to this case,

190
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,440
former USAF member William Drager. Drager first appears in Leonard Stringfield's UFO

191
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,240
crash retrievals reports in an entry titled Del Rio, Texas 1950. Here is another case of

192
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,400
conflicting dates with our two cases. While this entry lists 1950, Drager clearly discusses

193
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Willingham's case. Drager, fluent in Spanish, was hired as an interpreter for a Japanese

194
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,160
documentary discussing a UFO crash involving a colonel near the Mexican border. I have not

195
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,120
been able to find this documentary, but I have seen screenshots from it in Noah Torres' book.

196
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,160
In an affidavit provided, Drager details how he contacted a Mexican general who commanded that

197
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,000
area of the border. Drager explains the case of the general and the general stated quote,

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,240
yes, I know about that. I don't have any papers or documents to prove it, but due to my position,

199
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,480
I know about that end quote. Drager, Willingham and the film crew met with the general who on camera

200
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,400
denied and evaded any questions dealing with the incident and UFOs. According to Drager,

201
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,280
this man was beyond reproach and a quote unquote military celebrity in Mexico.

202
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,880
Before we get into the 1950 L Indio case listed in the Eisenhower Briefing MJ12 document, how can

203
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,720
we concretely say these two incidents are not the same? Well, for starters, the memo describes

204
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,800
the crashed object as totally incinerated, while Willingham's case describes three major pieces

205
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:12,080
of wreckage. Two, the 1950 cases listed as occurring on December 6th, 1950. Willingham

206
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,200
served in Korea until his injury, which occurred on December 26th, 1950. And three, the 1950 cases

207
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,840
stated as occurring 75 miles south of Del Rio between El Indio and Guerrero. The Langstree

208
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,240
location is 60 miles northwest of Del Rio. And finally point four, Willingham's case describes

209
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,360
use of distant early warning or due systems. These were not implemented until 1952, so impossible to

210
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:50,480
be associated with the 1950 case. So what exactly can we find out about this 1950 crash? From our

211
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:59,040
alleged 1952 MJ12 memo, we observe a craft almost incinerated, recovered between El Indio, Texas,

212
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,440
and Guerrero, Mexico. The wreckage is then sent to the Atomic Energy Commission's Sandia facility.

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,880
And unfortunately, there really isn't too much to be found out about this case. I can

214
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,560
reference a 1995 Omni Magazine article titled Crash at El Indio, alleged UFO crash in Mexico

215
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,000
by Dennis Stacey. Stacey had conducted a mission from 1990 to 94 to decipher the crashed location

216
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,680
and determine whether the story mentioned in the document was real or a hoax.

217
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,440
Stacey found a town resident, Sr. Flores, who actually witnessed the event, quote,

218
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,360
he had been working on his family's land north of town, north of the river in El Indio, when a ball

219
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,960
of fire fell from the sky, crashing on the adjoining ranch and igniting a grass fire.

220
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,200
A day or two later, a military contingent arrived from Pitas Negras, blocking off the location and

221
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,800
hauled something away by truck. Flores was not aware if the military vehicles were Mexican,

222
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:05,200
American, or a mix and had no idea if the wreckage was hauled away. Stacey thinks that possibly,

223
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,880
but without confirmation, this could be describing a case of a civil air patrol plane crash that

224
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:20,320
occurred on January 16, 1944. But this date, January 6, 1950, is a key date. On this day,

225
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,080
a nationwide US alert was called at 1030 a.m. Eastern time regarding, quote,

226
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,360
large number of unidentified aircraft approaching northeastern US at high altitude.

227
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,560
Defense command is taking action to dispatch interceptors. No reason to believe they are

228
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,880
friendly, end quote. Within the document, an estimated 40 signatures were spotted at 32,000 feet.

229
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,480
Funny enough, General Raimi, yes, the same general from Roswell canceled this alert

230
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,760
at 1316 hours. Interestingly enough, December 8, 1950, then sees a confidential memo directed

231
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,240
to J. Edgar Hoover regarding flying saucers and how Army intelligence has been put on high alert

232
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,800
for any data whatsoever on these flying discs. So while we really can't find any factual data on

233
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,920
this L-Indio crash, we can find nationwide alert regarding UFOs at the same time. Does this FBI

234
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,440
memo have to do with the Air Force Unidentified Craft Alert, or possibly a crash retrieval?

235
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,760
We do know from the Guy Hoddle memo sent later this year, the FBI was in fact discussing crash

236
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,320
retrievals and bodies. Apparently, UFO researcher Todd Zechel, yes, the same from Willingham's case,

237
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,240
obtained a declassified USF document stating the military had recovered a foreign object on December

238
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,080
6 or 7 of 1950 and transported it back to Carswell AFB. But this unwillingness to provide any shred

239
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,320
of proof of this document means we cannot consider this part of the case. So remember how the MJ-12

240
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,000
document mentions the debris was taken to Sandia Labs and into the hands of the AEC? Well, here's

241
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,120
where things get interesting. We all know in the 2024 NDAA, the AEC was historically used to

242
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,560
misclassify and obfuscate UFO information and likely more materials, legacy programs, etc.

243
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,360
But Sandia Labs sits on the property of Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. In 1949, President

244
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,320
Truman handed over managerial responsibilities of Sandia to AT&T, yes, the phone company,

245
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,680
the same one that made the transistor in the 1940s. Well, if we look at Stephen Greer's document

246
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,680
archive of his disclosure project witness list, we can find two examples of redacted names,

247
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,640
protected witnesses involving AT&T and NHI. One entry states, quote, witness from ACC with

248
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,680
knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&T, end quote, in the private industrial sector.

249
00:25:53,680 --> 00:26:00,560
Another which states, quote, President of Blank, knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&T,

250
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,920
he has been on radio sighting show, may have useful pseudonyms knows about the ET technology

251
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,520
transfer program, end quote. And Kirtland itself along with Sandia has been forever intertwined

252
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,840
with UFO lore. So this is extremely interesting how at the time of this alleged retrieval,

253
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,960
Sandia managed by AT&T under Kirtland Air Force Base received this ET technology and Greer has

254
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,600
multiple witnesses who comment on some sort of ET or NHI technology transfer to the company who

255
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,000
knows maybe AT&T is one of our early suspects for UFOs in the private sector. I mean, after all,

256
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,760
let's look back to my Lockheed Martin video to the claims of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar A. Fouch,

257
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,240
who stated that Lockheed had reverse engineered the now infamous TR3B. He stated that part of

258
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,960
this reverse engineering UAP program came from Sandia Labs. Remember AT&T managed Sandia until

259
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,160
1993 when it was taken over by you guessed it Lockheed Martin. So there's a lot more to investigate

260
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,400
here and maybe a little bit more truth to this 1950 crash than meets the eye. Hey guys, thank you so

261
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,800
much for watching and joining me as I investigated these 1950s Del Rio, Texas UFO crashes. When I

262
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:25,680
started this investigation, I was just expecting to cover one case 1950. From everything I had read,

263
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,320
I thought that Willingham story, the MJ 12 document, William Drager and so forth all covered one event.

264
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,160
So when I read the book, the other Roswell by Noah Torres, which I highly recommended became

265
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,560
clear that we were talking about two separate instances. I would like to know what you guys

266
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,400
think especially about Willingham. I am eagerly awaiting the author to get back in touch with me

267
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,520
because, at least to me, the body's claims, the conflicting claims are a huge red flag,

268
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,320
massive. And I can't really consider this story as anything more than just a story until I have

269
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,080
those details ironed out. It is already enough of a problem to me that Willingham changed small

270
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,040
details on his affidavit. Sure, they might be small such as the aircraft he was flying in the year.

271
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,000
However, these are still very important things to get right because if these details are wrong,

272
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,240
the affidavit is pretty much null and void. It's kind of disappointing especially that he

273
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,720
relies on head injuries in Korea to say there's these problems with his memories. But, you know,

274
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,320
maybe I'll be able to find out a little more and give an update. I think the December 6 1950 crash

275
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,080
is really interesting even though we don't have much details because that MJ 12 document and I

276
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,440
made a post about this in community and I'll say it again. I think the MJ 12 documents combine a lot

277
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,600
of disinformation and factual information similar to what Stanton Freeman claims. And to me, the

278
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,160
context of this crash is super interesting, especially with Sandia Labs, Kirtland, the AEC,

279
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,680
just all sorts of delicious puzzle pieces that kind of hook together and kind of weave into what we

280
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,920
already think about when we already think of crash retrievals. I promise you guys that next

281
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,520
episode is another whistleblowers video volume two. I got plenty of those. I got plenty of ideas,

282
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,400
trust me. There's like a dozen, two dozen other crash retrievals I also want to cover and we'll

283
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,600
get to them in time. I thank everyone so much for watching today. Please remember to like and

00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,800
channel is worth. And I'd like to get a thought from you guys. We're approaching 5000 subscribers.

287
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,720
At 5000, I still wanted to do a video explaining the origins and taxonomy of NHI that was a

288
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,760
deleted slide in Carl Nell Soul Foundation presentation. So if you guys want to see that,

289
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,600
let me know. If everyone just wants more research, that's totally fine too. I love making these videos.

290
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,840
It doesn't matter what I make. I just want to research. I want to put stuff out there that I

291
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,480
think is worth talking about and discussing. So you let me know what you guys want and please

292
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,160
in the comments let me know what you thought of these cases. I really want to know what you guys

293
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,400
think about Willingham. Am I being too harsh here? I don't think I am. I think I'm just kind of

294
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,040
weighing the facts. This case is a little different to some others like Roswell. Roswell of course is

295
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,920
our best documented crash with all the affidavit signed and all the witnesses and even something

296
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,000
like Kingman with Arthur Stansel. Sure, we have about one affidavit as well to describe that story

297
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,520
with some connecting things like Dr. Ed Dahl and Eric Wang and so forth. But the fact of the matter

298
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,960
is with Stansel, we don't have details in his affidavit that change. So I think Willingham's

299
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,080
story, while fascinating, has a lot less credibility, but there is a lot of context around his citing

300
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,440
that is pretty interesting, such as other B-47 signings. So thank you guys. Appreciate it and

301
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,680
I will catch everybody on the next show.
