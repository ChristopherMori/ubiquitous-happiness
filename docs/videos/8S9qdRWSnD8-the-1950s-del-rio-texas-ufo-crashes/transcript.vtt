00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
It didn't start or end with Roswell. Throughout American and world history, there are numerous

00:05.640 --> 00:12.020
encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails and witnesses.

00:12.020 --> 00:19.040
And sometimes, these trails get messy. Details, records, and facts of one case may be confused

00:19.040 --> 00:24.080
with another, making it difficult to fully analyze the stories of these fascinating

00:24.080 --> 00:30.880
retrieval efforts. This is especially true for two cases along the arid desert border of Texas and

00:30.880 --> 00:37.160
Mexico. What's up guys, it's UAP GERP. Thank you so much for joining me today as we are going to

00:37.160 --> 00:44.440
cover a region of Texas near the Texas-Mexico border named Del Rio that experienced not one,

00:44.440 --> 00:51.120
but two alleged UFO crash and recovery operations during the 1950s. Over the years,

00:51.120 --> 00:57.280
these two cases have almost molded into one, but due to their insanely interesting stories and

00:57.280 --> 01:03.400
astonishing connections to ufology, each deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens. Are these

01:03.400 --> 01:08.360
cases fact or fiction? Join me today as we investigate to find out.

01:08.360 --> 01:19.680
In June of 2018, Dr. Eric Davis was interviewed by journalist George Knapp on Coast to Coast

01:19.840 --> 01:25.920
AM. And yes, this is the same Eric Davis from the Wilson Davis memo whose scientific pedigree

01:25.920 --> 01:32.080
cannot be understated. When the two legends of ufology begin discussing UFO reverse engineering

01:32.080 --> 01:38.080
efforts, the doctor states, quote, Yeah, they've got, I would say, you know, if you're going to throw

01:38.080 --> 01:45.680
your bets on Roswell, your bets really good. Del Rio, Texas, that was a 1950s case. That was

01:45.680 --> 01:51.360
another one. And the other ones I won't bring up because those are still classified. Researching

01:51.360 --> 01:57.200
the highly disputed MJ 12 documents leads us to another clue surrounding the Texas-Mexico border.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.320
Following the description of the Roswell case in the Eisenhower briefing document,

02:02.320 --> 02:08.560
the alleged MJ 12 document to brief the president incumbent highlights a case from the 6th of December

02:08.880 --> 02:16.240
1950. This case saw a UFO of similar origin to Roswell impact the earth at high speeds

02:16.240 --> 02:22.960
along the El Indio area of the Texas-Mexico border. The craft impacted at such high speeds,

02:22.960 --> 02:28.400
it was nearly obliterated when the search team arrived. The recovered materials were transported

02:28.400 --> 02:35.040
to the atomic energy commission facility at Sandia, New Mexico for study. Okay, pretty cut and dry,

02:35.040 --> 02:40.560
right? El Indio is 75 miles southeast of Del Rio. So it makes sense to use this as a

02:40.560 --> 02:46.960
reference point, right? But there is another case that occurred in 1955 that researchers

02:46.960 --> 02:53.280
additionally use the Del Rio area as a reference point. The Colonel Robert Willingham crash retrieval

02:53.280 --> 02:59.200
case near Langtree, Texas. There are a number of huge factors separating these cases we will cover

02:59.280 --> 03:05.040
later in the video. But lack of study of these two cases has led to egregious misidentification

03:05.040 --> 03:09.200
between the two. So let's take a step back and analyze each case.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.560
Colonel Robert Burton Willingham served honorably in World War II in Korea.

03:18.560 --> 03:24.160
His distinguished career saw him within the US Army, Air Force, Air Force Reserves,

03:24.160 --> 03:28.560
and civilian air patrol. Serving in the US Air Force during Korea,

03:28.560 --> 03:32.480
Willingham claims to have received a purple heart for his severe wounds suffered to his

03:32.480 --> 03:38.560
leg and head when hit by a mortar shell and a foxhole. I use the word claims here very deliberately

03:38.560 --> 03:44.000
because I have not been able to verify any receiving of his purple heart. Now it is worth

03:44.000 --> 03:49.840
mentioning there are some respected ufologists like Kevin Randall in his book Crash where UFOs fall

03:49.840 --> 03:56.000
from the sky who doubt or call into question Willingham's Air Force service record. And this

03:56.000 --> 04:00.960
is because the National Personal Record Service in St. Louis, Missouri was unable to provide his

04:00.960 --> 04:07.680
service record. However, what is worthy to note on July 12, 1973, there was a fire in this building

04:07.680 --> 04:15.440
that destroyed most military records for personnel serving between 1947 and 1963. Now the author

04:15.440 --> 04:21.200
Noah Torres has stated he has over 50 documents to prove Willingham's Air Force service, but

04:21.200 --> 04:27.040
I have yet to see these documents. These injuries saw Willingham unable to return to combat,

04:27.040 --> 04:33.120
where he then returned to Texas as an Air Force Reserve pilot. On a spring day in 1955,

04:33.120 --> 04:38.240
the Colonel and Reserves were running a Cold War simulation mission where Willingham and other

04:38.240 --> 04:45.280
F-86 aviators assisted B-47 and B-52 bombers. It is on this mission, Robert claims to have

04:45.280 --> 04:51.680
experienced a crashed UAP. Before we get started, I would like to immediately cite my primary sources

04:51.680 --> 04:57.120
and discuss the history of Willingham coming public. I will primarily be pulling from the 2008

04:57.120 --> 05:04.400
book The Other Roswell UFO Crash on the Texas Border written by Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte

05:04.400 --> 05:09.280
due to the author's personal work and interviews with Robert near the end of his life in 2015.

05:09.840 --> 05:16.080
Robert first went public with his story in 1965, featured in a Pennsylvania weekly newspaper called

05:16.080 --> 05:22.560
Mechanicsburg. An article asking civilian air patrol pilots about UFO counters first oversaw

05:22.560 --> 05:28.480
the Colonel's story. 12 years later, researchers found clippings of this article in the NICAP,

05:28.480 --> 05:34.080
the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon, lost in the annals of NICAP's files.

05:34.720 --> 05:40.160
Researcher Todd Zechel tracked down Willingham and made him sign an affidavit. And I do have to

05:40.160 --> 05:45.280
point out the inaccuracies between this article and the affidavit versus the other Roswell book I

05:45.280 --> 05:51.440
am referencing. In this article from 67 and affidavit from 77, Willingham states he was flying

05:51.440 --> 05:56.960
in F-94. He goes on to say in the other Roswell book he was actually flying an F-86 Sabre.

05:57.600 --> 06:03.120
In the article, he claims his experience happened in 1948, but in the book and other sources,

06:03.120 --> 06:09.120
Willingham claims to have seen the UFO in 1955. This he blames on a faulty memory due to the

06:09.120 --> 06:14.320
head injury he sustained in Korea, but this to me does in fact hurt Willingham's credibility.

06:18.880 --> 06:25.920
On a spring day in 1955, the Colonel and other F-86 aviators escorted B-47s for a Cold War

06:25.920 --> 06:32.080
simulation training exercise from the Carswell AFB. It's worth noting Willingham's serial number

06:32.080 --> 06:39.360
and call sign CD195 and Willie Eddy. The missions served to escort the bombers in their Texas leg

06:39.360 --> 06:44.720
of their New York to Texas to Washington state journey. Willingham stated the squadron had received

06:44.720 --> 06:50.080
intelligence by radio that fast-moving unidentified signatures had been picked up by the distant

06:50.080 --> 06:56.240
early warning radar systems, dues, located in Canada. These signatures were moving south towards

06:56.240 --> 07:02.640
Texas. During the mission, the pilot of the B-47 radioed in about an unknown aircraft picked up on

07:02.640 --> 07:10.000
radar moving south from the northwest. Willingham then saw a bright big object like a star coming

07:10.000 --> 07:16.560
his way. The object approached within 35 to 40 miles of the USF regiment at an estimated speed of

07:16.560 --> 07:21.920
2,000 miles per hour. This was an estimate by Willingham because the craft seemed to go four

07:21.920 --> 07:28.160
times the speed of its F-86, which traveled at 685 miles per hour. Willingham described the

07:28.160 --> 07:34.320
brightly lit surface, quote, like magnesium steel. Other pilots, including George Smithson,

07:34.320 --> 07:40.000
stated they had also seen the craft in a post-incident debrief. The object made a 90-degree

07:40.000 --> 07:45.520
turn headed southwest towards the Mexican border. Shortly after the turn, the object was seen to

07:45.520 --> 07:52.480
emit, quote, a lot of sparks, and it tilted down at about a 45-degree angle. The colonel wondered

07:52.480 --> 07:57.600
if this was due to the abrupt turning maneuver causing hull damage. The object fell out of view

07:57.600 --> 08:03.600
and the colonel assumed it had crash-landed just west of Del Rio. Now quickly, there is no report

08:03.600 --> 08:10.720
of this sighting in 1955. However, we can look to the Condon Report I spoke of in my stigma video,

08:10.720 --> 08:17.760
which was created specifically to push the UFO stigma. Case 5 of the report lists a military UFO

08:17.760 --> 08:25.120
encounter from 19 September 1957, also from Carzwell Air Force Base in Fort Worth. In this

08:25.120 --> 08:31.360
recorded encounter, a large bright fireball alternating red to white chased a USAF RB-47

08:31.360 --> 08:37.680
for more than 600 miles. The object was seen by flight crew, detected by Carzwell radar,

08:37.680 --> 08:43.120
and picked up by the RB-47's radar. Interestingly, the equipment for electronic

08:43.120 --> 08:48.560
countermeasures and reconnaissance aboard the RB-47 registered the UFO emanating a strong

08:48.560 --> 08:55.040
radar signal of 2800 megacycles. Quoted from the Condon Report from pilot Louis D. Chase, quote,

08:55.600 --> 09:00.240
Before any evasive action could be taken, the light crossed in front of the plane,

09:00.240 --> 09:05.680
moving to the right at a velocity far higher than airplane speeds. The light was seen by pilot

09:05.680 --> 09:10.960
and co-pilot and appeared to the pilot to be a glowing body as big as a barn, end quote. The

09:10.960 --> 09:17.280
Condon Report shockingly detailed how the ECM, graphic, and radar data were all removed upon

09:17.280 --> 09:23.120
landing by intelligence personnel. Onscreen now is the original CIA report of this incident.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.960
Anyways, back to Willingham. Familiar with the area, Robert estimated the crash to be

09:28.960 --> 09:34.400
in Langtree, Texas. He radio Denver flight controller, requesting permission to fly to

09:34.400 --> 09:41.360
the estimated crash site. Denver replied, quote, Yes, go check out what it was and where it hit.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.480
We want to know where it was, too, end quote. Willingham approached Langtree from San Angelo

09:46.480 --> 09:52.800
and brought his F-86 down to an altitude of near 800 feet. It was here he observed the wreckage of

09:52.800 --> 09:58.240
a disc-shaped craft, which collided with the ground just south of the Rio Grande on the Mexican

09:58.560 --> 10:05.120
side of the border. The craft had seemingly collided and skidded 300 feet across the ground.

10:05.120 --> 10:10.240
The colonel returned to mission and formulated a plan to visit the site privately when he returned

10:10.240 --> 10:15.600
to base. The colonel arrived to Corsicana Airfield, met his friend, and prepared to depart to the

10:15.600 --> 10:22.320
wreckage in a 1947 Erronka Champion. Willingham's friend slipped under the radar and faced no

10:22.320 --> 10:29.680
reprisals for this incident. His name was later revealed after his death in 2002, as Jack Perkins,

10:29.680 --> 10:34.000
a Pennsylvania electronics engineer who served in the Civil Air Patrol with Robert.

10:34.560 --> 10:39.040
Before we go on to the crash, there may be just a little more to Willingham's story than meets the

10:39.040 --> 10:46.400
eye. This unclassified document from the 18th of July, 1955, just months after Willingham's encounter,

10:46.400 --> 10:51.920
details a response request from USAF Captain Ladi Marin to a request from the commander of

10:51.920 --> 10:58.720
USAF Security Services in San Antonio. The commander was requesting for data on UFO sightings from

10:58.720 --> 11:05.760
NEAC, the Northeast Air Command, and Northwestern United States specifically from B-47 jets.

11:06.320 --> 11:12.160
This could very well be coincidence, but it is interesting how a USAF commander in San Antonio

11:12.160 --> 11:17.440
of all places was interested in B-47 UFO encounters right after Robert's sighting.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.800
And we do have another very relevant case from spring the year before Willingham's encounter,

11:22.800 --> 11:30.320
1954. On May 14, 1954, a flight of marine reserve jets led by Major Charles Scarborough

11:30.880 --> 11:37.360
flew about six miles west of Dallas, Texas. The team spotted 16 unidentified signatures

11:37.360 --> 11:44.080
in groups of four. Pilot Scarborough and Jorgensen attempted to box these UFOs alternating between

11:44.080 --> 11:50.560
white to orange, similar to our other two cases. The signatures accelerated away rapidly at high

11:50.560 --> 12:01.360
speeds evading the Marines. Perkins and Willingham reached the crash area at about 4 p.m. The object

12:01.360 --> 12:06.960
had broken off into roughly three sections with debris strewn everywhere. The object appeared to

12:06.960 --> 12:14.000
be dome-shaped, 12 to 15 feet in length, resting 50 feet beyond the main body of the UFO. The main

12:14.080 --> 12:21.200
body appeared to be a flattened disc, 20 to 25 feet in diameter, split into two larger pieces.

12:21.200 --> 12:26.960
Half the disc was embedded into a sandy mound. While touching down, the two noticed Mexican

12:26.960 --> 12:32.720
soldiers, jeeps, and cars formed in a perimeter around the crash site. The two men approached

12:32.720 --> 12:38.080
the site and observed many pieces of debris, quote, there were lots of pieces of debris,

12:38.080 --> 12:43.840
some little and some large chunks about as big as a good sofa chair. Willingham noted the

12:43.840 --> 12:49.680
Mexicans were not attempting material gathering or retrieval effort of any kind. No trucks or

12:49.680 --> 12:54.480
airplanes were at the scene. The soldiers appeared to be simply standing perimeter on the site.

12:55.040 --> 13:00.240
After touching down quite a distance from the wreckage, Mexican soldiers approached the two men.

13:00.240 --> 13:05.360
One of these, an officer named Lieutenant Martinez from Mexico City, noted Willingham's

13:05.360 --> 13:12.480
use half fatigues and offered to take him near the site. But without Perkins, Martinez told Robert,

13:13.200 --> 13:19.040
we can't let anyone close to it. The American Air Force will be here very soon to clean this

13:19.040 --> 13:24.800
all up. Now, Willingham assumed the military men were from the closest army base, Ciudad Acuna,

13:24.800 --> 13:29.920
around 100 miles away. I have not been able to track down any record of a Lieutenant Martinez

13:29.920 --> 13:34.720
here. But according to Willingham's story, the Mexican government was simply guarding the wreckage

13:34.720 --> 13:40.720
for an American crash retrieval team to show up. This is a process claimed that pops up relatively

13:40.720 --> 13:46.560
often, such as the 1978 Bolivia crash retrieval I talked about in my Moondust video, which saw

13:46.560 --> 13:52.560
Bolivian authorities alerting American military to inspect the downed UFO. When departing the

13:52.560 --> 13:57.360
wreckage, Willingham decided he would not leave without evidence of the crash, so he grabbed a

13:57.360 --> 14:03.360
small piece of shiny metal debris. Upon returning to base, Willingham submitted an oral and written

14:03.360 --> 14:09.200
report to Reserve Commander Colonel Miller and soon received threats not to discuss his sightings,

14:09.200 --> 14:13.840
warning of consequences. One General in USAF Intelligence told him, quote,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.040
Don't say anything about what you saw down on the border.

14:21.520 --> 14:28.240
The material Willingham possessed was rigid, unyielding, but extremely light, and grayish

14:28.240 --> 14:35.280
silver in color. It reminded him of magnesium steel, small honeycomb patterned holes lined the

14:35.280 --> 14:41.600
side, which the Colonel figured was to dissipate heat. There was no inscription, symbols, or

14:41.600 --> 14:47.280
characters on it, unlike the Roswell material. This material shares little resemblance to the

14:47.280 --> 14:52.080
shape memory alloy found at Roswell and likely studied by Battelle Memorial Institute.

14:52.800 --> 14:58.160
Willingham tried to test the piece's material properties through a series of deformation tests,

14:58.160 --> 15:03.120
including torch cutting, all to no avail. According to Willingham, he possessed the

15:03.120 --> 15:08.160
material for four days, but in his haste to study the material took no images.

15:08.160 --> 15:12.560
The Colonel sent the fragment to USMC Metallurgy Lab in Hagerstown, Maryland.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.560
A USMC major received the material and was perplexed by the structure. Willingham gave him

15:18.560 --> 15:24.240
his number and address to receive the piece back. Some time later, Willingham contacted the lab to

15:24.240 --> 15:29.680
talk to the major. He was told no such person had worked there, nor did they know anything about

15:29.680 --> 15:36.080
this mysterious metal. There were no records of tests. He attempted to pursue the chain of command,

15:36.080 --> 15:41.920
but was told it would be in his best interest not to pursue the matter further. While Willingham's

15:41.920 --> 15:48.240
story may be suspect here regarding the materials, what is undeniable is the fact USG did in fact

15:48.240 --> 15:54.000
partake in the study of UFO materials. Even if you discount the Battelle-Roswell connection,

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
we can analyze Project Moondust, tasked with recovering foreign space vehicles and UFOs,

16:00.000 --> 16:06.800
or the 1966 CIA memo titled, Exploitation of Metallic Fragment from Unidentified Flying

16:06.800 --> 16:11.840
Object, which discusses material from a fallen UFO recovered in the Congo.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.680
Now, this is one of the most troubling aspects of this case for me. In the other Roswell,

16:21.680 --> 16:27.840
there is a specific chapter on alien bodies. No mention of NHI is made here, quote,

16:27.840 --> 16:33.280
I never saw bodies. I was not able to get close enough and I don't know what happened after I

16:33.280 --> 16:38.720
left, end quote. Willingham reasons the most likely place for bodies, if there were any,

16:38.720 --> 16:44.880
would be under the dome shaped section of the craft. However, on a July 24th, 2012 interview

16:44.880 --> 16:51.520
with Jeff Rents, Willingham specifically states he saw bodies. Yeah. Okay, so the front of the

16:51.520 --> 16:58.400
craft that impacted the ground ripped a hole open inside and apparently people could see in there

16:59.120 --> 17:04.720
and there were dead ETs or they weren't humans, there were dead bodies in there of some kind.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.160
Right, right. And you couldn't get around there to see in there either.

17:09.120 --> 17:14.640
Well, I kind of snuck around. You're a sneaky fella, aren't you? All right, now tell

17:14.640 --> 17:20.880
you snuck around there a little bit, Colonel. What did you see? Well, it didn't look like

17:20.880 --> 17:29.360
human beings to me. How many of them were there? I believe there were three and the

17:29.360 --> 17:35.360
lieutenant said there were four. All right. I never did see the other one. Were the bodies

17:35.360 --> 17:39.200
mangled or were they relatively intact and what were they dressed in?

17:40.240 --> 17:47.600
Well, they weren't dressed at all. Okay. And they were in a lot of different pieces. I didn't see

17:47.600 --> 17:55.520
but one that had a complete top. But I wouldn't swear what he was eating. All right. What did the

17:55.520 --> 18:01.920
head look like? Anything like we've seen in the common research literature, the big eyes,

18:01.920 --> 18:08.640
the smooth skin or the little mouth. Did you see anything? Yeah, some of them that looked like that.

18:10.000 --> 18:20.400
They just, I don't know how you explain it, but they just, their heads and arms and stuff,

18:20.400 --> 18:27.600
their arms are a little bitty. They look like boomsticks.

18:28.560 --> 18:36.000
Well, okay. But they had a big room stick. All right. No, no, I got you. They had no uniform on.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.400
They were just basically skin if that's what their outer covering is. The point of bodies

18:42.400 --> 18:48.400
is reiterated in the 2023 presentation given by author of the book, Noah Torres, who additionally

18:48.400 --> 18:53.920
mentions bodies. Was this poor reporting in the book? I don't think so because Willingham is

18:54.000 --> 18:59.760
specifically quoted as not seeing bodies. I will absolutely not fall back in an argument that

18:59.760 --> 19:05.120
Willingham's memory in old age was failing him, causing him to remember details poorly.

19:05.680 --> 19:10.800
This is the argument he uses as to why some small inaccuracies exist in his affidavit,

19:10.800 --> 19:15.840
like the type of plane he was flying. I have reached out to Noah Torres for more comment on the bodies

19:15.840 --> 19:20.640
because as of now, this is a massive issue in Willingham's credibility.

19:25.040 --> 19:29.680
We do have an independent witness who can bring some interesting details to this case,

19:29.680 --> 19:35.440
former USAF member William Drager. Drager first appears in Leonard Stringfield's UFO

19:35.440 --> 19:42.240
crash retrievals reports in an entry titled Del Rio, Texas 1950. Here is another case of

19:42.240 --> 19:48.400
conflicting dates with our two cases. While this entry lists 1950, Drager clearly discusses

19:48.400 --> 19:54.000
Willingham's case. Drager, fluent in Spanish, was hired as an interpreter for a Japanese

19:54.000 --> 20:00.160
documentary discussing a UFO crash involving a colonel near the Mexican border. I have not

20:00.160 --> 20:05.120
been able to find this documentary, but I have seen screenshots from it in Noah Torres' book.

20:05.760 --> 20:12.160
In an affidavit provided, Drager details how he contacted a Mexican general who commanded that

20:12.160 --> 20:18.000
area of the border. Drager explains the case of the general and the general stated quote,

20:18.000 --> 20:24.240
yes, I know about that. I don't have any papers or documents to prove it, but due to my position,

20:24.240 --> 20:30.480
I know about that end quote. Drager, Willingham and the film crew met with the general who on camera

20:30.480 --> 20:36.400
denied and evaded any questions dealing with the incident and UFOs. According to Drager,

20:36.480 --> 20:41.280
this man was beyond reproach and a quote unquote military celebrity in Mexico.

20:45.840 --> 20:52.880
Before we get into the 1950 L Indio case listed in the Eisenhower Briefing MJ12 document, how can

20:52.880 --> 20:58.720
we concretely say these two incidents are not the same? Well, for starters, the memo describes

20:58.720 --> 21:04.800
the crashed object as totally incinerated, while Willingham's case describes three major pieces

21:04.800 --> 21:12.080
of wreckage. Two, the 1950 cases listed as occurring on December 6th, 1950. Willingham

21:12.080 --> 21:19.200
served in Korea until his injury, which occurred on December 26th, 1950. And three, the 1950 cases

21:19.200 --> 21:25.840
stated as occurring 75 miles south of Del Rio between El Indio and Guerrero. The Langstree

21:25.840 --> 21:32.240
location is 60 miles northwest of Del Rio. And finally point four, Willingham's case describes

21:32.240 --> 21:39.360
use of distant early warning or due systems. These were not implemented until 1952, so impossible to

21:39.360 --> 21:50.480
be associated with the 1950 case. So what exactly can we find out about this 1950 crash? From our

21:50.480 --> 21:59.040
alleged 1952 MJ12 memo, we observe a craft almost incinerated, recovered between El Indio, Texas,

21:59.120 --> 22:05.440
and Guerrero, Mexico. The wreckage is then sent to the Atomic Energy Commission's Sandia facility.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.880
And unfortunately, there really isn't too much to be found out about this case. I can

22:10.880 --> 22:18.560
reference a 1995 Omni Magazine article titled Crash at El Indio, alleged UFO crash in Mexico

22:18.560 --> 22:26.000
by Dennis Stacey. Stacey had conducted a mission from 1990 to 94 to decipher the crashed location

22:26.000 --> 22:29.680
and determine whether the story mentioned in the document was real or a hoax.

22:30.480 --> 22:35.440
Stacey found a town resident, Sr. Flores, who actually witnessed the event, quote,

22:35.440 --> 22:41.360
he had been working on his family's land north of town, north of the river in El Indio, when a ball

22:41.360 --> 22:46.960
of fire fell from the sky, crashing on the adjoining ranch and igniting a grass fire.

22:46.960 --> 22:53.200
A day or two later, a military contingent arrived from Pitas Negras, blocking off the location and

22:53.200 --> 22:58.800
hauled something away by truck. Flores was not aware if the military vehicles were Mexican,

22:58.800 --> 23:05.200
American, or a mix and had no idea if the wreckage was hauled away. Stacey thinks that possibly,

23:05.200 --> 23:10.880
but without confirmation, this could be describing a case of a civil air patrol plane crash that

23:10.880 --> 23:20.320
occurred on January 16, 1944. But this date, January 6, 1950, is a key date. On this day,

23:20.320 --> 23:26.080
a nationwide US alert was called at 1030 a.m. Eastern time regarding, quote,

23:26.080 --> 23:31.360
large number of unidentified aircraft approaching northeastern US at high altitude.

23:31.360 --> 23:36.560
Defense command is taking action to dispatch interceptors. No reason to believe they are

23:36.560 --> 23:42.880
friendly, end quote. Within the document, an estimated 40 signatures were spotted at 32,000 feet.

23:43.440 --> 23:48.480
Funny enough, General Raimi, yes, the same general from Roswell canceled this alert

23:48.480 --> 23:55.760
at 1316 hours. Interestingly enough, December 8, 1950, then sees a confidential memo directed

23:55.760 --> 24:02.240
to J. Edgar Hoover regarding flying saucers and how Army intelligence has been put on high alert

24:02.240 --> 24:08.800
for any data whatsoever on these flying discs. So while we really can't find any factual data on

24:08.800 --> 24:15.920
this L-Indio crash, we can find nationwide alert regarding UFOs at the same time. Does this FBI

24:15.920 --> 24:21.440
memo have to do with the Air Force Unidentified Craft Alert, or possibly a crash retrieval?

24:22.080 --> 24:27.760
We do know from the Guy Hoddle memo sent later this year, the FBI was in fact discussing crash

24:27.760 --> 24:34.320
retrievals and bodies. Apparently, UFO researcher Todd Zechel, yes, the same from Willingham's case,

24:34.320 --> 24:40.240
obtained a declassified USF document stating the military had recovered a foreign object on December

24:40.240 --> 24:48.080
6 or 7 of 1950 and transported it back to Carswell AFB. But this unwillingness to provide any shred

24:48.080 --> 24:54.320
of proof of this document means we cannot consider this part of the case. So remember how the MJ-12

24:54.320 --> 25:00.000
document mentions the debris was taken to Sandia Labs and into the hands of the AEC? Well, here's

25:00.000 --> 25:07.120
where things get interesting. We all know in the 2024 NDAA, the AEC was historically used to

25:07.200 --> 25:14.560
misclassify and obfuscate UFO information and likely more materials, legacy programs, etc.

25:14.560 --> 25:21.360
But Sandia Labs sits on the property of Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. In 1949, President

25:21.360 --> 25:28.320
Truman handed over managerial responsibilities of Sandia to AT&T, yes, the phone company,

25:28.320 --> 25:33.680
the same one that made the transistor in the 1940s. Well, if we look at Stephen Greer's document

25:33.680 --> 25:39.680
archive of his disclosure project witness list, we can find two examples of redacted names,

25:39.680 --> 25:46.640
protected witnesses involving AT&T and NHI. One entry states, quote, witness from ACC with

25:46.640 --> 25:53.680
knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&T, end quote, in the private industrial sector.

25:53.680 --> 26:00.560
Another which states, quote, President of Blank, knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&T,

26:00.560 --> 26:05.920
he has been on radio sighting show, may have useful pseudonyms knows about the ET technology

26:05.920 --> 26:11.520
transfer program, end quote. And Kirtland itself along with Sandia has been forever intertwined

26:11.520 --> 26:17.840
with UFO lore. So this is extremely interesting how at the time of this alleged retrieval,

26:17.840 --> 26:24.960
Sandia managed by AT&T under Kirtland Air Force Base received this ET technology and Greer has

26:24.960 --> 26:31.600
multiple witnesses who comment on some sort of ET or NHI technology transfer to the company who

26:31.600 --> 26:38.000
knows maybe AT&T is one of our early suspects for UFOs in the private sector. I mean, after all,

26:38.000 --> 26:43.760
let's look back to my Lockheed Martin video to the claims of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar A. Fouch,

26:43.760 --> 26:50.240
who stated that Lockheed had reverse engineered the now infamous TR3B. He stated that part of

26:50.240 --> 26:56.960
this reverse engineering UAP program came from Sandia Labs. Remember AT&T managed Sandia until

26:56.960 --> 27:04.160
1993 when it was taken over by you guessed it Lockheed Martin. So there's a lot more to investigate

27:04.160 --> 27:10.400
here and maybe a little bit more truth to this 1950 crash than meets the eye. Hey guys, thank you so

27:10.400 --> 27:18.800
much for watching and joining me as I investigated these 1950s Del Rio, Texas UFO crashes. When I

27:18.800 --> 27:25.680
started this investigation, I was just expecting to cover one case 1950. From everything I had read,

27:25.680 --> 27:32.320
I thought that Willingham story, the MJ 12 document, William Drager and so forth all covered one event.

27:33.200 --> 27:38.160
So when I read the book, the other Roswell by Noah Torres, which I highly recommended became

27:38.160 --> 27:42.560
clear that we were talking about two separate instances. I would like to know what you guys

27:42.560 --> 27:48.400
think especially about Willingham. I am eagerly awaiting the author to get back in touch with me

27:48.400 --> 27:55.520
because, at least to me, the body's claims, the conflicting claims are a huge red flag,

27:55.520 --> 28:02.320
massive. And I can't really consider this story as anything more than just a story until I have

28:02.320 --> 28:08.080
those details ironed out. It is already enough of a problem to me that Willingham changed small

28:08.080 --> 28:13.040
details on his affidavit. Sure, they might be small such as the aircraft he was flying in the year.

28:13.600 --> 28:18.000
However, these are still very important things to get right because if these details are wrong,

28:18.000 --> 28:24.240
the affidavit is pretty much null and void. It's kind of disappointing especially that he

28:24.240 --> 28:28.720
relies on head injuries in Korea to say there's these problems with his memories. But, you know,

28:28.720 --> 28:34.320
maybe I'll be able to find out a little more and give an update. I think the December 6 1950 crash

28:34.320 --> 28:40.080
is really interesting even though we don't have much details because that MJ 12 document and I

28:40.080 --> 28:45.440
made a post about this in community and I'll say it again. I think the MJ 12 documents combine a lot

28:45.440 --> 28:51.600
of disinformation and factual information similar to what Stanton Freeman claims. And to me, the

28:51.600 --> 28:58.160
context of this crash is super interesting, especially with Sandia Labs, Kirtland, the AEC,

28:58.160 --> 29:03.680
just all sorts of delicious puzzle pieces that kind of hook together and kind of weave into what we

29:03.680 --> 29:07.920
already think about when we already think of crash retrievals. I promise you guys that next

29:07.920 --> 29:13.520
episode is another whistleblowers video volume two. I got plenty of those. I got plenty of ideas,

29:13.520 --> 29:18.400
trust me. There's like a dozen, two dozen other crash retrievals I also want to cover and we'll

29:18.400 --> 29:23.600
get to them in time. I thank everyone so much for watching today. Please remember to like and

29:23.600 --> 29:27.360
subscribe and hey, if you think the channel is worth a little bit of cash, feel free to join

29:27.360 --> 29:31.920
that Patreon. I'm not going to keep gatekeep any of my content, only support what you think the

29:31.920 --> 29:36.800
channel is worth. And I'd like to get a thought from you guys. We're approaching 5000 subscribers.

29:37.440 --> 29:44.720
At 5000, I still wanted to do a video explaining the origins and taxonomy of NHI that was a

29:44.720 --> 29:49.760
deleted slide in Carl Nell Soul Foundation presentation. So if you guys want to see that,

29:49.760 --> 29:55.600
let me know. If everyone just wants more research, that's totally fine too. I love making these videos.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.840
It doesn't matter what I make. I just want to research. I want to put stuff out there that I

29:59.840 --> 30:04.480
think is worth talking about and discussing. So you let me know what you guys want and please

30:04.480 --> 30:08.160
in the comments let me know what you thought of these cases. I really want to know what you guys

30:08.160 --> 30:12.400
think about Willingham. Am I being too harsh here? I don't think I am. I think I'm just kind of

30:12.400 --> 30:17.040
weighing the facts. This case is a little different to some others like Roswell. Roswell of course is

30:17.040 --> 30:21.920
our best documented crash with all the affidavit signed and all the witnesses and even something

30:21.920 --> 30:28.000
like Kingman with Arthur Stansel. Sure, we have about one affidavit as well to describe that story

30:28.000 --> 30:33.520
with some connecting things like Dr. Ed Dahl and Eric Wang and so forth. But the fact of the matter

30:33.520 --> 30:38.960
is with Stansel, we don't have details in his affidavit that change. So I think Willingham's

30:38.960 --> 30:44.080
story, while fascinating, has a lot less credibility, but there is a lot of context around his citing

30:44.080 --> 30:49.440
that is pretty interesting, such as other B-47 signings. So thank you guys. Appreciate it and

30:49.440 --> 30:51.680
I will catch everybody on the next show.
