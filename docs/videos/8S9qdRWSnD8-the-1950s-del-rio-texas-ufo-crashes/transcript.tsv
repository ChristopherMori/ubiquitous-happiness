0	5640	It didn't start or end with Roswell. Throughout American and world history, there are numerous
5640	12020	encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails and witnesses.
12020	19040	And sometimes, these trails get messy. Details, records, and facts of one case may be confused
19040	24080	with another, making it difficult to fully analyze the stories of these fascinating
24080	30880	retrieval efforts. This is especially true for two cases along the arid desert border of Texas and
30880	37160	Mexico. What's up guys, it's UAP GERP. Thank you so much for joining me today as we are going to
37160	44440	cover a region of Texas near the Texas-Mexico border named Del Rio that experienced not one,
44440	51120	but two alleged UFO crash and recovery operations during the 1950s. Over the years,
51120	57280	these two cases have almost molded into one, but due to their insanely interesting stories and
57280	63400	astonishing connections to ufology, each deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens. Are these
63400	68360	cases fact or fiction? Join me today as we investigate to find out.
68360	79680	In June of 2018, Dr. Eric Davis was interviewed by journalist George Knapp on Coast to Coast
79840	85920	AM. And yes, this is the same Eric Davis from the Wilson Davis memo whose scientific pedigree
85920	92080	cannot be understated. When the two legends of ufology begin discussing UFO reverse engineering
92080	98080	efforts, the doctor states, quote, Yeah, they've got, I would say, you know, if you're going to throw
98080	105680	your bets on Roswell, your bets really good. Del Rio, Texas, that was a 1950s case. That was
105680	111360	another one. And the other ones I won't bring up because those are still classified. Researching
111360	117200	the highly disputed MJ 12 documents leads us to another clue surrounding the Texas-Mexico border.
117920	122320	Following the description of the Roswell case in the Eisenhower briefing document,
122320	128560	the alleged MJ 12 document to brief the president incumbent highlights a case from the 6th of December
128880	136240	1950. This case saw a UFO of similar origin to Roswell impact the earth at high speeds
136240	142960	along the El Indio area of the Texas-Mexico border. The craft impacted at such high speeds,
142960	148400	it was nearly obliterated when the search team arrived. The recovered materials were transported
148400	155040	to the atomic energy commission facility at Sandia, New Mexico for study. Okay, pretty cut and dry,
155040	160560	right? El Indio is 75 miles southeast of Del Rio. So it makes sense to use this as a
160560	166960	reference point, right? But there is another case that occurred in 1955 that researchers
166960	173280	additionally use the Del Rio area as a reference point. The Colonel Robert Willingham crash retrieval
173280	179200	case near Langtree, Texas. There are a number of huge factors separating these cases we will cover
179280	185040	later in the video. But lack of study of these two cases has led to egregious misidentification
185040	189200	between the two. So let's take a step back and analyze each case.
193920	198560	Colonel Robert Burton Willingham served honorably in World War II in Korea.
198560	204160	His distinguished career saw him within the US Army, Air Force, Air Force Reserves,
204160	208560	and civilian air patrol. Serving in the US Air Force during Korea,
208560	212480	Willingham claims to have received a purple heart for his severe wounds suffered to his
212480	218560	leg and head when hit by a mortar shell and a foxhole. I use the word claims here very deliberately
218560	224000	because I have not been able to verify any receiving of his purple heart. Now it is worth
224000	229840	mentioning there are some respected ufologists like Kevin Randall in his book Crash where UFOs fall
229840	236000	from the sky who doubt or call into question Willingham's Air Force service record. And this
236000	240960	is because the National Personal Record Service in St. Louis, Missouri was unable to provide his
240960	247680	service record. However, what is worthy to note on July 12, 1973, there was a fire in this building
247680	255440	that destroyed most military records for personnel serving between 1947 and 1963. Now the author
255440	261200	Noah Torres has stated he has over 50 documents to prove Willingham's Air Force service, but
261200	267040	I have yet to see these documents. These injuries saw Willingham unable to return to combat,
267040	273120	where he then returned to Texas as an Air Force Reserve pilot. On a spring day in 1955,
273120	278240	the Colonel and Reserves were running a Cold War simulation mission where Willingham and other
278240	285280	F-86 aviators assisted B-47 and B-52 bombers. It is on this mission, Robert claims to have
285280	291680	experienced a crashed UAP. Before we get started, I would like to immediately cite my primary sources
291680	297120	and discuss the history of Willingham coming public. I will primarily be pulling from the 2008
297120	304400	book The Other Roswell UFO Crash on the Texas Border written by Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte
304400	309280	due to the author's personal work and interviews with Robert near the end of his life in 2015.
309840	316080	Robert first went public with his story in 1965, featured in a Pennsylvania weekly newspaper called
316080	322560	Mechanicsburg. An article asking civilian air patrol pilots about UFO counters first oversaw
322560	328480	the Colonel's story. 12 years later, researchers found clippings of this article in the NICAP,
328480	334080	the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon, lost in the annals of NICAP's files.
334720	340160	Researcher Todd Zechel tracked down Willingham and made him sign an affidavit. And I do have to
340160	345280	point out the inaccuracies between this article and the affidavit versus the other Roswell book I
345280	351440	am referencing. In this article from 67 and affidavit from 77, Willingham states he was flying
351440	356960	in F-94. He goes on to say in the other Roswell book he was actually flying an F-86 Sabre.
357600	363120	In the article, he claims his experience happened in 1948, but in the book and other sources,
363120	369120	Willingham claims to have seen the UFO in 1955. This he blames on a faulty memory due to the
369120	374320	head injury he sustained in Korea, but this to me does in fact hurt Willingham's credibility.
378880	385920	On a spring day in 1955, the Colonel and other F-86 aviators escorted B-47s for a Cold War
385920	392080	simulation training exercise from the Carswell AFB. It's worth noting Willingham's serial number
392080	399360	and call sign CD195 and Willie Eddy. The missions served to escort the bombers in their Texas leg
399360	404720	of their New York to Texas to Washington state journey. Willingham stated the squadron had received
404720	410080	intelligence by radio that fast-moving unidentified signatures had been picked up by the distant
410080	416240	early warning radar systems, dues, located in Canada. These signatures were moving south towards
416240	422640	Texas. During the mission, the pilot of the B-47 radioed in about an unknown aircraft picked up on
422640	430000	radar moving south from the northwest. Willingham then saw a bright big object like a star coming
430000	436560	his way. The object approached within 35 to 40 miles of the USF regiment at an estimated speed of
436560	441920	2,000 miles per hour. This was an estimate by Willingham because the craft seemed to go four
441920	448160	times the speed of its F-86, which traveled at 685 miles per hour. Willingham described the
448160	454320	brightly lit surface, quote, like magnesium steel. Other pilots, including George Smithson,
454320	460000	stated they had also seen the craft in a post-incident debrief. The object made a 90-degree
460000	465520	turn headed southwest towards the Mexican border. Shortly after the turn, the object was seen to
465520	472480	emit, quote, a lot of sparks, and it tilted down at about a 45-degree angle. The colonel wondered
472480	477600	if this was due to the abrupt turning maneuver causing hull damage. The object fell out of view
477600	483600	and the colonel assumed it had crash-landed just west of Del Rio. Now quickly, there is no report
483600	490720	of this sighting in 1955. However, we can look to the Condon Report I spoke of in my stigma video,
490720	497760	which was created specifically to push the UFO stigma. Case 5 of the report lists a military UFO
497760	505120	encounter from 19 September 1957, also from Carzwell Air Force Base in Fort Worth. In this
505120	511360	recorded encounter, a large bright fireball alternating red to white chased a USAF RB-47
511360	517680	for more than 600 miles. The object was seen by flight crew, detected by Carzwell radar,
517680	523120	and picked up by the RB-47's radar. Interestingly, the equipment for electronic
523120	528560	countermeasures and reconnaissance aboard the RB-47 registered the UFO emanating a strong
528560	535040	radar signal of 2800 megacycles. Quoted from the Condon Report from pilot Louis D. Chase, quote,
535600	540240	Before any evasive action could be taken, the light crossed in front of the plane,
540240	545680	moving to the right at a velocity far higher than airplane speeds. The light was seen by pilot
545680	550960	and co-pilot and appeared to the pilot to be a glowing body as big as a barn, end quote. The
550960	557280	Condon Report shockingly detailed how the ECM, graphic, and radar data were all removed upon
557280	563120	landing by intelligence personnel. Onscreen now is the original CIA report of this incident.
563760	568960	Anyways, back to Willingham. Familiar with the area, Robert estimated the crash to be
568960	574400	in Langtree, Texas. He radio Denver flight controller, requesting permission to fly to
574400	581360	the estimated crash site. Denver replied, quote, Yes, go check out what it was and where it hit.
581360	586480	We want to know where it was, too, end quote. Willingham approached Langtree from San Angelo
586480	592800	and brought his F-86 down to an altitude of near 800 feet. It was here he observed the wreckage of
592800	598240	a disc-shaped craft, which collided with the ground just south of the Rio Grande on the Mexican
598560	605120	side of the border. The craft had seemingly collided and skidded 300 feet across the ground.
605120	610240	The colonel returned to mission and formulated a plan to visit the site privately when he returned
610240	615600	to base. The colonel arrived to Corsicana Airfield, met his friend, and prepared to depart to the
615600	622320	wreckage in a 1947 Erronka Champion. Willingham's friend slipped under the radar and faced no
622320	629680	reprisals for this incident. His name was later revealed after his death in 2002, as Jack Perkins,
629680	634000	a Pennsylvania electronics engineer who served in the Civil Air Patrol with Robert.
634560	639040	Before we go on to the crash, there may be just a little more to Willingham's story than meets the
639040	646400	eye. This unclassified document from the 18th of July, 1955, just months after Willingham's encounter,
646400	651920	details a response request from USAF Captain Ladi Marin to a request from the commander of
651920	658720	USAF Security Services in San Antonio. The commander was requesting for data on UFO sightings from
658720	665760	NEAC, the Northeast Air Command, and Northwestern United States specifically from B-47 jets.
666320	672160	This could very well be coincidence, but it is interesting how a USAF commander in San Antonio
672160	677440	of all places was interested in B-47 UFO encounters right after Robert's sighting.
678080	682800	And we do have another very relevant case from spring the year before Willingham's encounter,
682800	690320	1954. On May 14, 1954, a flight of marine reserve jets led by Major Charles Scarborough
690880	697360	flew about six miles west of Dallas, Texas. The team spotted 16 unidentified signatures
697360	704080	in groups of four. Pilot Scarborough and Jorgensen attempted to box these UFOs alternating between
704080	710560	white to orange, similar to our other two cases. The signatures accelerated away rapidly at high
710560	721360	speeds evading the Marines. Perkins and Willingham reached the crash area at about 4 p.m. The object
721360	726960	had broken off into roughly three sections with debris strewn everywhere. The object appeared to
726960	734000	be dome-shaped, 12 to 15 feet in length, resting 50 feet beyond the main body of the UFO. The main
734080	741200	body appeared to be a flattened disc, 20 to 25 feet in diameter, split into two larger pieces.
741200	746960	Half the disc was embedded into a sandy mound. While touching down, the two noticed Mexican
746960	752720	soldiers, jeeps, and cars formed in a perimeter around the crash site. The two men approached
752720	758080	the site and observed many pieces of debris, quote, there were lots of pieces of debris,
758080	763840	some little and some large chunks about as big as a good sofa chair. Willingham noted the
763840	769680	Mexicans were not attempting material gathering or retrieval effort of any kind. No trucks or
769680	774480	airplanes were at the scene. The soldiers appeared to be simply standing perimeter on the site.
775040	780240	After touching down quite a distance from the wreckage, Mexican soldiers approached the two men.
780240	785360	One of these, an officer named Lieutenant Martinez from Mexico City, noted Willingham's
785360	792480	use half fatigues and offered to take him near the site. But without Perkins, Martinez told Robert,
793200	799040	we can't let anyone close to it. The American Air Force will be here very soon to clean this
799040	804800	all up. Now, Willingham assumed the military men were from the closest army base, Ciudad Acuna,
804800	809920	around 100 miles away. I have not been able to track down any record of a Lieutenant Martinez
809920	814720	here. But according to Willingham's story, the Mexican government was simply guarding the wreckage
814720	820720	for an American crash retrieval team to show up. This is a process claimed that pops up relatively
820720	826560	often, such as the 1978 Bolivia crash retrieval I talked about in my Moondust video, which saw
826560	832560	Bolivian authorities alerting American military to inspect the downed UFO. When departing the
832560	837360	wreckage, Willingham decided he would not leave without evidence of the crash, so he grabbed a
837360	843360	small piece of shiny metal debris. Upon returning to base, Willingham submitted an oral and written
843360	849200	report to Reserve Commander Colonel Miller and soon received threats not to discuss his sightings,
849200	853840	warning of consequences. One General in USAF Intelligence told him, quote,
853840	857040	Don't say anything about what you saw down on the border.
861520	868240	The material Willingham possessed was rigid, unyielding, but extremely light, and grayish
868240	875280	silver in color. It reminded him of magnesium steel, small honeycomb patterned holes lined the
875280	881600	side, which the Colonel figured was to dissipate heat. There was no inscription, symbols, or
881600	887280	characters on it, unlike the Roswell material. This material shares little resemblance to the
887280	892080	shape memory alloy found at Roswell and likely studied by Battelle Memorial Institute.
892800	898160	Willingham tried to test the piece's material properties through a series of deformation tests,
898160	903120	including torch cutting, all to no avail. According to Willingham, he possessed the
903120	908160	material for four days, but in his haste to study the material took no images.
908160	912560	The Colonel sent the fragment to USMC Metallurgy Lab in Hagerstown, Maryland.
913200	918560	A USMC major received the material and was perplexed by the structure. Willingham gave him
918560	924240	his number and address to receive the piece back. Some time later, Willingham contacted the lab to
924240	929680	talk to the major. He was told no such person had worked there, nor did they know anything about
929680	936080	this mysterious metal. There were no records of tests. He attempted to pursue the chain of command,
936080	941920	but was told it would be in his best interest not to pursue the matter further. While Willingham's
941920	948240	story may be suspect here regarding the materials, what is undeniable is the fact USG did in fact
948240	954000	partake in the study of UFO materials. Even if you discount the Battelle-Roswell connection,
954000	960000	we can analyze Project Moondust, tasked with recovering foreign space vehicles and UFOs,
960000	966800	or the 1966 CIA memo titled, Exploitation of Metallic Fragment from Unidentified Flying
966800	971840	Object, which discusses material from a fallen UFO recovered in the Congo.
976640	981680	Now, this is one of the most troubling aspects of this case for me. In the other Roswell,
981680	987840	there is a specific chapter on alien bodies. No mention of NHI is made here, quote,
987840	993280	I never saw bodies. I was not able to get close enough and I don't know what happened after I
993280	998720	left, end quote. Willingham reasons the most likely place for bodies, if there were any,
998720	1004880	would be under the dome shaped section of the craft. However, on a July 24th, 2012 interview
1004880	1011520	with Jeff Rents, Willingham specifically states he saw bodies. Yeah. Okay, so the front of the
1011520	1018400	craft that impacted the ground ripped a hole open inside and apparently people could see in there
1019120	1024720	and there were dead ETs or they weren't humans, there were dead bodies in there of some kind.
1024720	1028160	Right, right. And you couldn't get around there to see in there either.
1029120	1034640	Well, I kind of snuck around. You're a sneaky fella, aren't you? All right, now tell
1034640	1040880	you snuck around there a little bit, Colonel. What did you see? Well, it didn't look like
1040880	1049360	human beings to me. How many of them were there? I believe there were three and the
1049360	1055360	lieutenant said there were four. All right. I never did see the other one. Were the bodies
1055360	1059200	mangled or were they relatively intact and what were they dressed in?
1060240	1067600	Well, they weren't dressed at all. Okay. And they were in a lot of different pieces. I didn't see
1067600	1075520	but one that had a complete top. But I wouldn't swear what he was eating. All right. What did the
1075520	1081920	head look like? Anything like we've seen in the common research literature, the big eyes,
1081920	1088640	the smooth skin or the little mouth. Did you see anything? Yeah, some of them that looked like that.
1090000	1100400	They just, I don't know how you explain it, but they just, their heads and arms and stuff,
1100400	1107600	their arms are a little bitty. They look like boomsticks.
1108560	1116000	Well, okay. But they had a big room stick. All right. No, no, I got you. They had no uniform on.
1116000	1122400	They were just basically skin if that's what their outer covering is. The point of bodies
1122400	1128400	is reiterated in the 2023 presentation given by author of the book, Noah Torres, who additionally
1128400	1133920	mentions bodies. Was this poor reporting in the book? I don't think so because Willingham is
1134000	1139760	specifically quoted as not seeing bodies. I will absolutely not fall back in an argument that
1139760	1145120	Willingham's memory in old age was failing him, causing him to remember details poorly.
1145680	1150800	This is the argument he uses as to why some small inaccuracies exist in his affidavit,
1150800	1155840	like the type of plane he was flying. I have reached out to Noah Torres for more comment on the bodies
1155840	1160640	because as of now, this is a massive issue in Willingham's credibility.
1165040	1169680	We do have an independent witness who can bring some interesting details to this case,
1169680	1175440	former USAF member William Drager. Drager first appears in Leonard Stringfield's UFO
1175440	1182240	crash retrievals reports in an entry titled Del Rio, Texas 1950. Here is another case of
1182240	1188400	conflicting dates with our two cases. While this entry lists 1950, Drager clearly discusses
1188400	1194000	Willingham's case. Drager, fluent in Spanish, was hired as an interpreter for a Japanese
1194000	1200160	documentary discussing a UFO crash involving a colonel near the Mexican border. I have not
1200160	1205120	been able to find this documentary, but I have seen screenshots from it in Noah Torres' book.
1205760	1212160	In an affidavit provided, Drager details how he contacted a Mexican general who commanded that
1212160	1218000	area of the border. Drager explains the case of the general and the general stated quote,
1218000	1224240	yes, I know about that. I don't have any papers or documents to prove it, but due to my position,
1224240	1230480	I know about that end quote. Drager, Willingham and the film crew met with the general who on camera
1230480	1236400	denied and evaded any questions dealing with the incident and UFOs. According to Drager,
1236480	1241280	this man was beyond reproach and a quote unquote military celebrity in Mexico.
1245840	1252880	Before we get into the 1950 L Indio case listed in the Eisenhower Briefing MJ12 document, how can
1252880	1258720	we concretely say these two incidents are not the same? Well, for starters, the memo describes
1258720	1264800	the crashed object as totally incinerated, while Willingham's case describes three major pieces
1264800	1272080	of wreckage. Two, the 1950 cases listed as occurring on December 6th, 1950. Willingham
1272080	1279200	served in Korea until his injury, which occurred on December 26th, 1950. And three, the 1950 cases
1279200	1285840	stated as occurring 75 miles south of Del Rio between El Indio and Guerrero. The Langstree
1285840	1292240	location is 60 miles northwest of Del Rio. And finally point four, Willingham's case describes
1292240	1299360	use of distant early warning or due systems. These were not implemented until 1952, so impossible to
1299360	1310480	be associated with the 1950 case. So what exactly can we find out about this 1950 crash? From our
1310480	1319040	alleged 1952 MJ12 memo, we observe a craft almost incinerated, recovered between El Indio, Texas,
1319120	1325440	and Guerrero, Mexico. The wreckage is then sent to the Atomic Energy Commission's Sandia facility.
1326000	1330880	And unfortunately, there really isn't too much to be found out about this case. I can
1330880	1338560	reference a 1995 Omni Magazine article titled Crash at El Indio, alleged UFO crash in Mexico
1338560	1346000	by Dennis Stacey. Stacey had conducted a mission from 1990 to 94 to decipher the crashed location
1346000	1349680	and determine whether the story mentioned in the document was real or a hoax.
1350480	1355440	Stacey found a town resident, Sr. Flores, who actually witnessed the event, quote,
1355440	1361360	he had been working on his family's land north of town, north of the river in El Indio, when a ball
1361360	1366960	of fire fell from the sky, crashing on the adjoining ranch and igniting a grass fire.
1366960	1373200	A day or two later, a military contingent arrived from Pitas Negras, blocking off the location and
1373200	1378800	hauled something away by truck. Flores was not aware if the military vehicles were Mexican,
1378800	1385200	American, or a mix and had no idea if the wreckage was hauled away. Stacey thinks that possibly,
1385200	1390880	but without confirmation, this could be describing a case of a civil air patrol plane crash that
1390880	1400320	occurred on January 16, 1944. But this date, January 6, 1950, is a key date. On this day,
1400320	1406080	a nationwide US alert was called at 1030 a.m. Eastern time regarding, quote,
1406080	1411360	large number of unidentified aircraft approaching northeastern US at high altitude.
1411360	1416560	Defense command is taking action to dispatch interceptors. No reason to believe they are
1416560	1422880	friendly, end quote. Within the document, an estimated 40 signatures were spotted at 32,000 feet.
1423440	1428480	Funny enough, General Raimi, yes, the same general from Roswell canceled this alert
1428480	1435760	at 1316 hours. Interestingly enough, December 8, 1950, then sees a confidential memo directed
1435760	1442240	to J. Edgar Hoover regarding flying saucers and how Army intelligence has been put on high alert
1442240	1448800	for any data whatsoever on these flying discs. So while we really can't find any factual data on
1448800	1455920	this L-Indio crash, we can find nationwide alert regarding UFOs at the same time. Does this FBI
1455920	1461440	memo have to do with the Air Force Unidentified Craft Alert, or possibly a crash retrieval?
1462080	1467760	We do know from the Guy Hoddle memo sent later this year, the FBI was in fact discussing crash
1467760	1474320	retrievals and bodies. Apparently, UFO researcher Todd Zechel, yes, the same from Willingham's case,
1474320	1480240	obtained a declassified USF document stating the military had recovered a foreign object on December
1480240	1488080	6 or 7 of 1950 and transported it back to Carswell AFB. But this unwillingness to provide any shred
1488080	1494320	of proof of this document means we cannot consider this part of the case. So remember how the MJ-12
1494320	1500000	document mentions the debris was taken to Sandia Labs and into the hands of the AEC? Well, here's
1500000	1507120	where things get interesting. We all know in the 2024 NDAA, the AEC was historically used to
1507200	1514560	misclassify and obfuscate UFO information and likely more materials, legacy programs, etc.
1514560	1521360	But Sandia Labs sits on the property of Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. In 1949, President
1521360	1528320	Truman handed over managerial responsibilities of Sandia to AT&T, yes, the phone company,
1528320	1533680	the same one that made the transistor in the 1940s. Well, if we look at Stephen Greer's document
1533680	1539680	archive of his disclosure project witness list, we can find two examples of redacted names,
1539680	1546640	protected witnesses involving AT&T and NHI. One entry states, quote, witness from ACC with
1546640	1553680	knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&T, end quote, in the private industrial sector.
1553680	1560560	Another which states, quote, President of Blank, knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&T,
1560560	1565920	he has been on radio sighting show, may have useful pseudonyms knows about the ET technology
1565920	1571520	transfer program, end quote. And Kirtland itself along with Sandia has been forever intertwined
1571520	1577840	with UFO lore. So this is extremely interesting how at the time of this alleged retrieval,
1577840	1584960	Sandia managed by AT&T under Kirtland Air Force Base received this ET technology and Greer has
1584960	1591600	multiple witnesses who comment on some sort of ET or NHI technology transfer to the company who
1591600	1598000	knows maybe AT&T is one of our early suspects for UFOs in the private sector. I mean, after all,
1598000	1603760	let's look back to my Lockheed Martin video to the claims of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar A. Fouch,
1603760	1610240	who stated that Lockheed had reverse engineered the now infamous TR3B. He stated that part of
1610240	1616960	this reverse engineering UAP program came from Sandia Labs. Remember AT&T managed Sandia until
1616960	1624160	1993 when it was taken over by you guessed it Lockheed Martin. So there's a lot more to investigate
1624160	1630400	here and maybe a little bit more truth to this 1950 crash than meets the eye. Hey guys, thank you so
1630400	1638800	much for watching and joining me as I investigated these 1950s Del Rio, Texas UFO crashes. When I
1638800	1645680	started this investigation, I was just expecting to cover one case 1950. From everything I had read,
1645680	1652320	I thought that Willingham story, the MJ 12 document, William Drager and so forth all covered one event.
1653200	1658160	So when I read the book, the other Roswell by Noah Torres, which I highly recommended became
1658160	1662560	clear that we were talking about two separate instances. I would like to know what you guys
1662560	1668400	think especially about Willingham. I am eagerly awaiting the author to get back in touch with me
1668400	1675520	because, at least to me, the body's claims, the conflicting claims are a huge red flag,
1675520	1682320	massive. And I can't really consider this story as anything more than just a story until I have
1682320	1688080	those details ironed out. It is already enough of a problem to me that Willingham changed small
1688080	1693040	details on his affidavit. Sure, they might be small such as the aircraft he was flying in the year.
1693600	1698000	However, these are still very important things to get right because if these details are wrong,
1698000	1704240	the affidavit is pretty much null and void. It's kind of disappointing especially that he
1704240	1708720	relies on head injuries in Korea to say there's these problems with his memories. But, you know,
1708720	1714320	maybe I'll be able to find out a little more and give an update. I think the December 6 1950 crash
1714320	1720080	is really interesting even though we don't have much details because that MJ 12 document and I
1720080	1725440	made a post about this in community and I'll say it again. I think the MJ 12 documents combine a lot
1725440	1731600	of disinformation and factual information similar to what Stanton Freeman claims. And to me, the
1731600	1738160	context of this crash is super interesting, especially with Sandia Labs, Kirtland, the AEC,
1738160	1743680	just all sorts of delicious puzzle pieces that kind of hook together and kind of weave into what we
1743680	1747920	already think about when we already think of crash retrievals. I promise you guys that next
1747920	1753520	episode is another whistleblowers video volume two. I got plenty of those. I got plenty of ideas,
1753520	1758400	trust me. There's like a dozen, two dozen other crash retrievals I also want to cover and we'll
1758400	1763600	get to them in time. I thank everyone so much for watching today. Please remember to like and
1763600	1767360	subscribe and hey, if you think the channel is worth a little bit of cash, feel free to join
1767360	1771920	that Patreon. I'm not going to keep gatekeep any of my content, only support what you think the
1771920	1776800	channel is worth. And I'd like to get a thought from you guys. We're approaching 5000 subscribers.
1777440	1784720	At 5000, I still wanted to do a video explaining the origins and taxonomy of NHI that was a
1784720	1789760	deleted slide in Carl Nell Soul Foundation presentation. So if you guys want to see that,
1789760	1795600	let me know. If everyone just wants more research, that's totally fine too. I love making these videos.
1795600	1799840	It doesn't matter what I make. I just want to research. I want to put stuff out there that I
1799840	1804480	think is worth talking about and discussing. So you let me know what you guys want and please
1804480	1808160	in the comments let me know what you thought of these cases. I really want to know what you guys
1808160	1812400	think about Willingham. Am I being too harsh here? I don't think I am. I think I'm just kind of
1812400	1817040	weighing the facts. This case is a little different to some others like Roswell. Roswell of course is
1817040	1821920	our best documented crash with all the affidavit signed and all the witnesses and even something
1821920	1828000	like Kingman with Arthur Stansel. Sure, we have about one affidavit as well to describe that story
1828000	1833520	with some connecting things like Dr. Ed Dahl and Eric Wang and so forth. But the fact of the matter
1833520	1838960	is with Stansel, we don't have details in his affidavit that change. So I think Willingham's
1838960	1844080	story, while fascinating, has a lot less credibility, but there is a lot of context around his citing
1844080	1849440	that is pretty interesting, such as other B-47 signings. So thank you guys. Appreciate it and
1849440	1851680	I will catch everybody on the next show.
