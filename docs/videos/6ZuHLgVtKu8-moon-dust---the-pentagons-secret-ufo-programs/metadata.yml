description: "Today we shed light on Project Moon Dust, one of the US Government's\
  \ secret UFO programs.\n\nSince the testimony of David Grusch, it is no longer just\
  \ speculation that the US Defense Industry actively retrieves and attempts reverse\
  \ engineering on crashed/uncovered UAPS. \n\nThough historically, those \"read in\"\
  \ have done a marvelous job misclassifying any real UFO information outside of the\
  \ pathetic official government UFO programs such as Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book,\
  \ the dots can be connected to programs actively engaging with the UFOs that rule\
  \ our skies by those with a keen eye. \n\nOne such program is Moon Dust, a UFO crash\
  \ retrieval program with deep ties to the US Air Force and Wright Patterson Air\
  \ Force Base. Though in the 1990s the Air Force denied Moon Dust existence and study\
  \ of UFO crash retrievals, a wealth of official documents say otherwise.\n\nI am\
  \ planning on building a sight to record all documents i use for research, study,\
  \ and videos so please sit tight!\n\nMusic By: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6pWOjm8ms-VqAAXGEktGfg\n\
