0	7600	Okay. We'll see. Hello, everybody. We are live. If you guys can hear, please just post
7600	14720	in the comments that you're hearing us and we can get started. So I need to see, usually
14720	18920	there, now the live counter's up. So there we go. Now it'll start populating. There's
18920	23920	definitely more than, okay, zero people in. We've got 13 people here. What is up, guys?
23920	29360	Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Somebody let us know. And then I need
29360	36240	to hop on Twitter and say, and put the live link as well. So let's just see while this
36240	41920	kind of sorts itself out. Sweet. They can hear us. I'd put it on my Twitter as well,
41920	46440	but I have like two followers. Okay. Okay. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. So guys, let me post
46440	52280	a tweet real fast, but I'll do another introduction as more people start filtering in. But this
52280	57440	is Kermit. He is the researcher you guys know who helped me out with the SAIC. Hey, it's
57440	64040	C. Britton. Yeah. He helped tremendously with SAIC, looking at contracts, working that
64040	68840	case with me. So let me just get a tweet out real fast. Kermit, if you just want to introduce
68840	74040	yourself while I'm doing this, please feel free. Hey, y'all. I'm Kermit. How's it going?
74040	80200	I've been posting about UFO stuff under the Reddit name frog and badger. My kind of angle
80200	84600	with this is kind of the legal financial framework, you know, specifically, you know,
84600	88680	we heard today, I mean, yesterday from the representatives about how they're interested
88680	92640	in how taxpayer funds are being spent on these programs. And that's kind of my, it's kind
92640	97920	of my area of expertise and my intellectual curiosity, so to speak. So been very, very
97920	102320	blessed to be able to work with Gerb the past couple of months on a bunch of different projects.
102320	107040	He came to me over the summer is like, Hey, I want to put out this, this documentary on
107040	110760	a company that you've been actually doing a lot of research on. And we did a really
110760	115240	good collaboration for that. I'm actually very happy with how it turned out. And yeah,
115240	119120	just been just digging through financial filings and trying to making, trying to make sense
119120	122520	of this legacy program, you know, so the truth is out there.
122520	131520	All right. All right. I'm almost done. Live. Sorry, guys. I'm just posting this on Twitter.
131520	136760	Might as well just show everyone in the chat here. Gerb and I were able to visit the National
136760	141600	Air and Space Museum and I was able to pick up a reproduction vehicle. If you want to
141600	148560	call it that B2 stealth bomber. So for any right there, you know, for anybody that doesn't
148560	155320	know there are classic stories of the B2 bomber utilizing, utilizing electrogravity technology
155320	161560	for an internal mass reduction of up to 89% and then electrogravity technology to kind
161560	167320	of obfuscate both exhaust signatures and radar cross section. So I'm posting this guys
167320	175760	and then we shall get started right away. Let's do it. Okay. So we'll start just looking.
175760	179400	What we'll do guys is we'll kind of talk about our time in DC. We're both in here right now
179400	187120	at Capitol Hill. So I'd like to talk a little bit about DC and the hearings as well as we
187200	193160	were able to attend the UAP disclosure fund meeting last night. So we got a lot to talk
193160	197960	about. We'll talk about immaculate constellation and everything and then we'll kind of go through
197960	203960	questions and so forth. So C's is asking right now, who is that guy? C's will say it again.
203960	208200	He just introduced himself, but this is Kermit. He's the excellent researcher who helps me
208200	213040	out with the SAIC research. His, his, the link to his Reddit will be in the description
213040	217800	page. He's made some awesome posts on kind of analyzing the legacy program framework
217800	222920	within SEC securities frameworks and stuff. And if you want to tell a little bit about
222920	226440	that, I'm a little bit about that post. I'm sure people would love to hear that. Yeah,
226440	231520	for sure. My, my most recent posts that I published, I want to say a month and a half
231520	236520	ago, I kind of looked at kind of all the laws in the books around like national security
236520	242160	programs and then not disclosing those operations on like a private company's financial statements.
242560	248680	So going back like almost a hundred years back to the SEC act of 1934, which kind of
248680	252040	historical context that was written into law because of the Great Depression and trying
252040	258040	to reform the banking system, but included within the SEC act of 1934 was a specific
258040	263120	exemption that allowed for the president and the heads of his executive agencies to waive
263120	267160	reporting requirements for any company that was involved with classified activities under
267160	271240	an executive order. So basically from that, and then throughout kind of the chronology
271280	275360	over decades, we kind of see a strengthening of those laws and those regulations that allow
275360	280440	for companies like Lockheed Martin, SAIC, you know, other defense primes to basically, you
280440	285000	know, do this classified work and not be as transparent or use a little bit more discretion
285000	288760	with how they report those operations in their financial statements.
288760	292080	And that's such interesting work. I mean, I know of some other individuals who are trying
292080	296200	to kind of attack legacy program for more of a financial framework. And this is something
296240	301200	that I personally don't see enough in the industry and kind of UAP researchers. So I
301200	304160	think that's really interesting, you know, carrying on the legacy of Katharine Austin
304160	309440	Fitz, the black budget of the United States and so forth. I just, I just need to make
309440	314160	sure we're caught up. I'm right now I'm worried about the this Wi-Fi here in the hotel. So
314160	318360	I'm just checking up that our dang stream is live guys. I'm sorry. We're at the holiday
318360	325480	in Capitol Hill and okay, we are perfect. It doesn't have the best Wi-Fi. Okay. So already
326240	331320	I'm like in Kermit, dude. Kermit's the dog. We've been having so much fun. So, you know,
331320	336960	we'll talk a little bit about the hearings. We both got in on Tuesday night. I was fortunate
336960	342400	enough to get a media pass for the hearings. So that was awesome. Yeah. If you guys see
342400	348840	some of the photos of, I think, who is it, Brett Higgins? Yeah. I mean, the profile picture
348840	353320	of the video from, I think Higgins, I'm kind of right there on the side. It was really
353400	359240	cool because, you know, right in front of the witnesses was Amar from the S Theory and some
359240	363960	other photographers snapping away. You know, inside the room, we'll talk about that. We'll
363960	370960	talk about the lines and so forth. This, we talked to many, many, many of the big dogs. Oh,
370960	376600	you know, we did. We did. Oh yeah. Yes. And we'll also talk about the event horizon interview
376600	382240	as well because something or someone I'm quite close to Ross, the producer of event horizon
382240	387520	and then John Michael Godier. So I've been able to talk to them a ton. T.W. This is a
387520	392960	friend of mine. There's no Peter here. This is Kermit, but thanks, Steve. Yeah. So doors
392960	397880	for the house building, they opened at 7, 7 a.m. Actually earlier than that, there were
397880	403000	people standing in line at like midnight, night before. I think one of them was Robert
403000	407520	Salas, but I think some people like Matt from the Good Trouble show have been getting heat
407560	412920	from Green Street because they actually paid professional waiters to wait in line. So I
412920	416680	had a, because I had the media pass, you know, I was afforded a little extra time. I was
416680	421200	going to go in right away, but I had some issues just sleep and do the excitement. So I had
421200	425920	to wait maybe an hour or two before you. So he showed up at actual 7 a.m. So what was
425920	431040	it like first doors, doors open and waiting to get in? Yeah. I mean, strolling, strolling
431040	436200	down Capitol Ave to go to the Rayburn office building. I've never attended. I've never
436240	439880	been inside like the Capitol building or any of that stuff. I've never attended hearings
439880	445200	before. So this is like a new experience for me. And I showed up like in kind of the line
445200	449840	for the UFO hearing at like about seven that morning. And at that point, like the line
449840	453840	was very, very deep. And I will say there were a lot of people in that line at that point
453840	457520	that I was like, Oh my God, like that's, that's Matt for that's Lester. Like, Oh my God. It
457520	462240	was a verifiable like who's who have, you know, UFO world and got to take a lot of people's
462280	467280	hands, got to meet a bunch of really cool people. Unfortunately, I was in kind of the
467280	471720	point or the part of the line that ended up not making it into the main room. I was like
471720	476440	10 people off from getting into that main area. But thankfully the staffers were able
476440	480560	to take kind of the rest of us, put us up an overflow and watch that live upstairs.
480560	485320	So I mean, not great, but you know, it is one of the picture of the overflow TV. Yeah,
485320	490040	for sure. I felt terrible about these guys because, you know, I'll just say, yeah, show
490120	494520	it. And then I'll make a quick comment because, you know, I got a lot to say from an almost
494520	501000	exact opposite point of view. I mean, it seemed like going in like it seemed like the hearing
501000	505200	room is going to be a bit bigger than the one last year. And it was the same hearing room
505200	510480	guy. It was the exact same hearing room. Oh, was the exact? Yes. Yes. But there. So there
510480	516480	was there were like, I think five rows of seats. Yeah. So this is, I don't know if you guys
516520	522920	can see this. If you hold it closer, it should auto adjust. Oh, no. Yes. There we go. That's
522920	528120	the TV. That was the screen that I was watching from everybody. Yeah. Front row seat kind
528120	532640	of, which is cool. Let's get the camera to auto adjust. Oh, that adjusted poorly. There
532640	537520	we go. Okay. It's starting to work. I won't, I won't show my phone. I won't show any other
537520	541280	pictures. We're still washed out with light, but that's all right. So kind of from from
541280	545760	my POV, I got to go in at a hearing started at 1130. I got to go in at 11 through the
545800	550480	media entrance. Some other people who got to do that were Jesse Amar from Yes Theory,
550480	556840	Chris from Area 52. He recently put out the, the Project Gravitar interview. And I got
556840	561200	to talk to him. I never met him. He's awesome. I really liked speaking to him. Chris was
561200	565480	great. You know, Jesse was rocking around and kind of his more laxed where I think it's
565480	569840	so funny because only Jesse could get away with that. In line, you know, most people
569840	573840	have their suits on. They're looking quite dapper. They're ready to go. And then there
573840	576920	is, there's some people out there with like alien headbands on.
576920	580320	There was, there was a lot of different fits on, man. There's, there were a bunch of different
580320	585680	people. I mean, talk about, talk about a like very, it's just like, like all walks of life.
585680	588200	You know what I mean? So then that was really cool to see too.
588200	589680	All walks of life unifying.
589680	593160	But the only person that could really pull it off, I'd say was, was Jesse. The only person
593160	598160	who looked like normal in a sense with a kind of strange bloving on was Jesse. But yeah,
598160	602080	some of the people that were pretty early in line were like Robert Salas. I think Chris
602160	607520	Bledsoe was there. But as far as people meeting, waiting in line, waiting in line met a ton
607520	611360	of people. There were actually a couple of people who recognized my name, which was really
611360	615840	cool. There are a few people like that. It was awesome. It was great to talk to some people.
615840	623040	So many people showed out. But you know, before getting in, talk to Jesse, Area 52, James
623040	627720	Fox, a bunch. James Fox actually posted a video, kind of walking through the hall. And
627720	631980	I think I walked right in front of him and I just looked like an idiot in that Lester
631980	636680	Nair as well from the UAP Caucus. He's a friend of ours. He actually was one of the people
636680	643920	who helped us get into the UAPDF. And that was really great. But so getting into the
643920	649280	actual witness room, we got to get in 30 minutes early. And from there, some of the RSVP, some
649280	654480	of the reserved seats got to pour in. And this took up about three or two and a half of the
654480	658960	five rows. And of these people were people you'd expect, you know, Leslie Kane, we'll
658960	661760	talk a little bit more about her later, because I actually got to talk to her for quite a
661760	668720	while at the UAPDF. Jeremy Corbell, I have some good insights as to the drama there.
668720	677960	Who else? James Fox, Jesse, Chris, Ryan Graves. A ton of people started pouring in and the
677960	682200	witnesses even early. So before the hearing even started, I got to chat a little bit with
682320	686720	Jeremy and so forth. I actually had a kind of a funny experience with him. I introduced
686720	692200	myself to Jeremy. I said, you know, hello, my name is I gave him my first name. And he's
692200	695080	like, where have I seen you before? And I said, maybe on YouTube under Gerb. And so he
695080	700120	goes, yeah, one of your whistleblowers you spoke to is correct. I went, who? Like who? And
700120	702800	he's like, that should be enough. He just refused to elaborate. He didn't wink at me and said
702800	707360	he had to like center himself a little bit before the before the hearing. So Jeremy, you
707360	710720	know, sometimes I criticize his work a little bit. Everyone's work can be criticized. Everyone's
710760	715360	work has flaws, but he was a really nice guy. I really enjoyed speaking to him. He was a kind
715360	720440	of a class act. However, after the hearing, which we'll discuss a little more, he was pretty
720440	727120	upset that he was the one who gave Congress on that day, the 12 page Immaculate Constellation
727120	735320	Report. I think Schellenberger's witness gave it to Burchett a while ago, right? But I believe
735320	739880	the situation was at this current day that Jeremy gave the Immaculate Constellation Report
739920	747080	to Mace and others. So there was a point where Mace, in the starting to talk about the hearings,
747800	755680	Jeremy started like getting visibly extremely upset, extremely upset. And afterwards, you
755680	759560	know, he was like on the brink of tears. He was so furious. And you know, some people were
759560	763040	talking and trying to get pictures. And he was being really nice about that. He was taking
763040	768160	pictures with everybody, kind of being a class act. But I say, you know, I talked to Merrick
768160	772480	on Renekamp. I said, hey, that's a good Jeremy. And so he explained the situation to me. And so I
772480	776960	went up to talk to Jeremy because this will be coming out in a little bit, but I got to interview
776960	782200	Rhett Burrelson afterwards. Herman was actually my fellow man there. We got some good questions
782200	786560	about there. It's not a super long interview. However, some of the questions asked were on
786600	794200	was he expecting other witnesses? Because I think somebody, somebody, jit boy, yeah, by the way,
794200	800720	I talked to introduce myself to Oak Shane, and I'm planning to talk to him more. But yeah, some
800720	806520	of the questions asked without spilling any details were, you know, seen if, sorry, just
806520	813200	got to, okay, was seen if Burrelson had expected other witnesses, right? Because we all heard
813200	817120	rumors of firsthand, you know, let me first hand guys, crash retrieval, legacy program
817120	822400	witnesses asked him about that, asked him specifically about ARV, asked him specifically
822400	826280	if he's read the Grush op ed, which, you know, I'm sure people really want to hear about
826280	831000	that. And asked him specifically if Congress has received actionable intelligence as it
831040	836080	started to move on some of these locations that have been named. Yeah. So Burrelson, in my
836080	843000	opinion, along with Luna and Moskowitz actually asked the whole all the best questions of the
843040	846280	the hearing. So before we get into hearing and discussing some of the questions, what was
846280	851320	asked, a couple funny points per chat with killing diet Mountain Dew, the whole whole show, I
851360	856200	think he had three diet Mountain Dews and like loves that Mountain Dew and Michael Gold was
856200	860640	just eating candy the whole time. He had a Lenovo laptop that had the greasiest trackpad I
860640	868360	ever saw. Jimmy, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Seriously. Falcon head. We
868360	872680	talked about this just now, but Corbell was upset because he submitted the 12 page Immaculate
872680	877120	Constellation report to Nancy Mace right before the hearing. And it was attributed to
877120	883560	Schellenberger, not not Corbell, when the report was kind of entered into the congressional
883560	888000	record, and he was furious about that. And there were only 11 pages, not 12. I think Jesse
888000	893840	just tweeted the last page. Oh, really? Yeah, from Jeremy Kenyon locker Corbell. So if you
893840	898640	guys want to see that go to Jesse Michael's page. And also now's a good time. I posted a
898640	901640	picture of it talked about a little bit because you got to meet Jesse, everybody got to meet
901640	909720	Jesse. Last week, I was just out in Austin for to record a show for Jesse. And so that
909720	915300	should be out soon. There we talk about everything from crash retrievals to the McCandless story
915300	922920	to ARV to deep underground military bases. I added in some we actually go a little bit
922920	927880	into ed the witness from Edwards Air Force Base. And we talked a little bit about his
927880	932040	background kind of referencing some of his public stations and so forth. So I think that's
932040	935320	going to be really interesting. Let's uh, while you're looking at that, I think we got
935320	939160	two questions here, including one with Joey had one year to force just one grush hostile
939160	944560	witness or aerospace exec to the stand, but bring gold new Congress one. Yeah, so I think
944560	951280	gold is people are pretty hot and cold about gold, right? Yeah. He, you know, he was really
951280	958520	pro NASA, which I think NASA is likely at least somewhat privy to UAP crash retrieval
958520	965640	programs. And NASA has historically lied about UAP as well, including a study in 1979 or
965640	972520	1980. It was a, sorry, 1978 or 1979. There were FOIA requests where NASA had previously
972520	976360	stated they never looked into UAP, but a bunch of FOIA documents came out showing that NASA
976360	982040	had been taking kind of an eye of UAP reports very seriously. So we will let's see what
982040	986000	Joey says here. What's up, Joey? I thought someone quote for Chet St. Corbell was the
986000	990200	guy who gave him a report months ago. I did hear something. Yeah, I did. I did as well
990200	995480	that he was involved. Yeah. Additionally, have you so, Gurp, have you read the 12th page?
995480	1000760	You just skimmed it once. You know, yeah, it is. So it's a cover letter from George Jeremy
1000760	1005160	Corbell. That was supposed to be the cover letter. And kind of talks a little bit about
1005200	1010320	how he got the document and all that. But it's not like an additional page of the document.
1010320	1017440	It's basically, it's, I believe Jeremy, you know, trying to, you know, convey that, you
1017440	1021280	know, he's kind of a part of this effort, you know, in providing this report to Congress.
1021280	1025560	I think that's what's really the meat of it. Yeah. Okay. I think someone in something
1025560	1031520	in someone as well as Therose here both make good points. Well, you know, it's good to
1031520	1035120	have a NASA guy calling for more transparency. It's still, you know, how much exactly can
1035120	1040240	NASA be trusted. Also, this guy was connected with OSAP and Bigelow Aerospace. So why were
1040240	1044760	questions not asked? And why was the topic not discussed about OSAP trying to kind of
1044760	1049320	facilitate craft transfer from Lockheed Martin? Yeah, well, they didn't even name Lockheed
1049320	1054640	Martin. I mean, Lou and others were quite afraid to even name it themselves. And then
1054640	1058480	even like one of their Congress people was like, Oh, well, we know this is the Lockheed
1058560	1062080	Martin case. And he said it out loud. But then when the response came back, it wasn't
1062080	1065600	like, Oh, yeah, it was a con, they said it was a contract. Right. It was a contractor.
1065600	1069040	But like, you know, as, as we've been kind of understanding the story over years, it's
1069040	1072920	like, well, we know what that contractor is. So like, why are we being cagey about it?
1072920	1077240	And where's the money trail? This is something we're digging. This is something that, there's
1077240	1083400	something that Kermit, tracking down the financials of legacy programs we're trying to uncover.
1083400	1087520	You know, there's reason to believe that sometimes programs are skimmed off of existing programs
1087560	1093360	such as the F 35, a 1.5 to $2 trillion program that witness Ed served as a subject matter
1093360	1097520	expert to various contracting companies after his time in reverse engineering programs at
1097520	1103280	Air Force. Ed, this witness also stated while working on the R and D panel chain at the Pentagon
1103280	1108880	that in two fiscal years, 34 billion and then 40 billion and non transfer of authority funds
1108880	1113840	were kind of issued back channel to legacy programs under the Air Force. So kind of trying
1113840	1116400	to track this stuff down, but let's see what two cents here.
1116400	1121600	I have some, I have some sense on this as well. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So I think in terms of like
1121600	1125920	funding, and we want to think about like kind of the avenues of what's kind of going on here,
1125920	1131360	just over time, I think it's, you know, it would not surprise me if there's kind of a bunch of
1131360	1134480	different things that are going on at play, because ultimately, right, you're just trying to
1134480	1138960	obfuscate this financial data so that people that, you know, otherwise have that access to that
1138960	1143040	information, they can't figure out what that money is actually going towards. Right. So I mean,
1143040	1148000	in and of itself, the money trail is part of the obfuscation, trying to figure that out is about
1148000	1152560	as important, I feel like is trying to see the crap and the bodies and all that stuff. So, you
1152560	1156480	know, it's kind of one of those core tenets and, you know, the truth is out there, but I mean,
1156480	1159680	I've been in this space for a year and a half, and I still have a bunch of different theories
1159680	1163920	about it. So we can talk about it for sure. And that's why we're trying to kind of track down
1163920	1168640	other people with a financial background like Kermit to really kind of make like a think tank
1168640	1173360	on this subject, because I'm financially illiterate when it comes to tracking this stuff down. I can
1173360	1177760	just report, like Witness Ed found $34 and $40 billion in non-TOA funds, but I can't really
1177760	1180800	understand the significance of that or make heads or tails of a balance sheet.
1180800	1184560	Yeah, because it's one thing for a witness to say, like, this is this is what I saw. But then,
1184560	1188640	you know, that's the substantive evidence of like, I saw the ledger, I saw the transactions,
1188640	1192960	this is corroborating basically that story. Right. Yeah, because yeah, Keegan was saying
1192960	1198240	that's a lot of funds. Yes, it is. I mean, at the R&D panel chain, he was overseeing over 200
1198320	1202880	billion per year in Air Force funds. Total just to kind of give everybody an idea,
1202880	1207920	like when we talk about R&D and IRAD, right? Humulatively, the United States government spends
1207920	1214080	about $150 billion annually just on defense R&D alone. That is a huge chunk of change. So,
1214080	1217760	I mean, the number could be anywhere from zero to that or even something different than that
1217760	1221440	entirely. We don't even know. Then there still exists the theory, and I don't know how we would
1221440	1225600	explore this more, that some of these legacy programs, if they are being conducted out of a
1225920	1230160	closed off military base, an underground base, perhaps they run off of closed systems.
1230880	1235280	That's another possibility. Yeah, there are claims out there that some of these locations run
1235280	1240400	off a cash-based system just as they do analog computers. Well, I'd be smart because you basically
1240400	1245200	minimize the audit trail, you know, people, just like money talks, right? Right. So, people are
1245200	1249600	spending money, if you have a, smaller the system and more closed than it is, the less chance that
1249600	1253200	you have it of being uncovered. And we were at the Air and Space Museum today, and we were kind of
1253200	1257920	hypothesizing, what if these programs with the craft like the ARV are able to just strip
1257920	1262800	mine the asteroid belt for precious metals and so forth. Yeah, you don't even need to get capital
1262800	1266480	or financing or anything here from earth, and you just get everything from your materials and
1266480	1271600	products off world, then no one's the wiser, right? So, that makes sense. Two cents, thank you so much.
1272480	1277520	Yeah, speaking of Seoul, Kermit and I will be going as well there. So, I know you guys are
1277520	1282640	already showing Kermit a lot of love. We'll do another stream after Seoul as well. I can't wait
1282640	1286640	to do that, and thank you again. Let me just, let me see this, and then we'll keep talking about
1286640	1292240	the hearings. Thank you, Wag Boss, paying ties to the overlord. Now, I'll never be an overlord.
1292240	1296480	Let's just hope John Jones gets knocked out this weekend, man, and I'll be a happy dude.
1297040	1301680	So, you know, I'd like to say, and I'm sure we talked about this a little bit, I was impressed
1301680	1307520	with Lou, not only with his testimony, but as a person as well. I was able to talk to him quite
1307520	1312160	a bit, both before the hearings. I just bumped into him while I was scrambly to find the house
1312160	1317200	building. I got coffee for a couple of friends. So, I'm just walking there. I see Lou outside.
1318560	1323040	A guy followed by Kermas, and he's like two feet taller, I mean, two feet shorter than the rest of
1323040	1327760	him. So, I know that's Lou, and I introduced myself and talked to him for a while. He was extremely
1327760	1335280	kind. I think he did well answering questions as well into the congressional report. I've said
1335280	1339680	this to you, and I'm sure you'll agree. There's still a lot of questions about Lou's background,
1340400	1347520	ASAP and ATIP. Greenwald has diligently tried to get answers to for years, and how the heck are we
1347520	1353760	going to get answers to what Lou's specific position was? Because now, of course, he has sworn
1353760	1358240	into congressional testimony that he was a high-ranking member at ASAP, correct? Or was it ATIP?
1358240	1362480	I'm just trying to remember off the top of my head. Well, I think that's the nature of the debate,
1362480	1367920	is it not? I think in his book, he claims that he was part of both ASAP and ATIP. ASAP was kind of
1367920	1373600	the initial effort where they were trying to get that divestiture from Lockheed, and then ATIP kind
1373600	1378000	of was the effort post-ASAP once that kind of fell through. That's my understanding of it, at least.
1378000	1383760	And I think one of the most consequential reports is Lou saying he cannot answer about being read
1383760	1388400	into a congressional program. Yeah, that was quite telling. I thought that was very telling.
1388400	1395840	So, Lou spoke at the UAPDF, which was kind of a closed event we were able to attend afterwards,
1395840	1401680	and this speech saw fellow speeches by Representative Burleson and Representative Rounds.
1401680	1406880	Senator Rounds. Yeah, sorry, Senator Rounds. So, this was a very consequential talk. I had some
1406880	1410720	time to speak with Lou, because I know a long time ago I had kind of informed some friends that,
1411360	1416080	via an analyst friend, that Lou would be agreeable to interview. Well, after this congressional
1416080	1420720	testimony, I'd like to interview him now, actually interview him in person, because
1421600	1425520	especially with his testimony, with Lou's media tour, I was kind of worried about
1426640	1430000	not really being able to approach with fresh questions, because he's kind of answering everything.
1430000	1435440	He's doing like 50 podcasts, but now I would really like to speak to him and just kind of
1435440	1444320	ask him to expand on some of the things he said and kind of testified to. I think, number one,
1444320	1450080	and I'm not going to be able to solve this on my platform, but to kind of clear up more issues
1450080	1455440	around ATIP and OSAP. Yeah. It's like Katsky, Stratton, Kelleher. Everybody's got a little
1455440	1460880	different bit of a different spin. Eric Davis. Well, they discussed Jay Stratton as well during
1460880	1465600	the hearings too, and I think he's also coming out with his book imminently, not the name of it,
1465600	1470400	but it's coming out quite soon. Well, hopefully we can talk to Eric Davis about this next week
1470400	1473680	at Sol, right? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Because, first of all, I'd like to thank you
1473680	1479440	so much, Siwan, for the $5. I really appreciate that. Sol is actually speaking at, or Schrock is
1479440	1484800	speaking at Sol next week, and he's also doing a Q&A. I believe it's with Eric Davis, right?
1486240	1489360	Sounds right. Okay, so yeah, there should be some good stuff. Let me go through these,
1489360	1494400	and we'll keep talking. Django, I love that pig. Thank you so much for the $15,
1494400	1498640	and Fat Rodents, thank you very much. Does this change what you'll ask at Sol at all?
1498640	1503040	Well, I'd like to interview some people at Sol, so we'll see what we can do there. I've
1504000	1507040	talking with Kermit, we're trying to work out some stuff for him to
1508000	1512560	you know, maybe go in a little bit more on some good camera equipment and actually travel around
1512560	1517200	to get some good interviews, but not just interviews, right? Like actual documentaries
1517200	1520720	spliced in with research and so forth, because interviewing Lou, I don't just want to
1521600	1526480	sit in front of a camera with him for two hours, but add in research. So I'd just like to ask you,
1526480	1535920	Kermit, what would, could you rank in terms of impact and efficacy and just all around feel,
1535920	1541120	who do you think was the most consequential person to testify to least? And guys in the chat,
1541120	1544640	give me a one through four, one being the most consequential, four being the least.
1544640	1553120	That's a good question. I'd say probably most consequential. I don't know, my personal
1553120	1556560	perspective of it is like the questions themselves are the controversial, you know,
1556560	1562800	that was the provocative stuff. But in terms of people, I would say Gallaudet being there and
1562880	1567920	being a representative from, you know, the Navy and Noah and being very high up in those positions,
1568880	1573680	you know, he being a representative of U.S. military and that kind of cohort and then
1574400	1578240	Elizondo representing military intelligence, Schellenberger being a journalist and then
1578240	1582800	finally Michael Gold being a scientist, right? So it was like, I felt like the panel overall
1582800	1587680	was very well stocked and it was diverse and it had all the people that we want to hear from
1587680	1593520	about this subject. I think Gallaudet was probably, for me, I think that that was probably the most
1593520	1597760	interesting, like those questions and those answers were probably the most interesting because we've
1597760	1601360	heard from Lou, you know, from his books and interviews and all this stuff and he does discuss
1601360	1605600	a lot of it and there was certainly some interesting things discussed today with him,
1606320	1612720	sorry, yesterday. But I'd say Gallaudet, I also think Michael Gold, I was actually very impressed
1612720	1616880	with the way that he kind of spoke about it and I think you spoke very positively about just like
1616960	1622320	NASA collaborating on this in the future and just kind of moving past the stigma that we see with
1622320	1627360	this topic and just trying to get, you know, the scientific community really to take this
1627360	1632800	seriously and investigate it. So I would say Gallaudet and Michael Gold were my top two picks.
1632800	1639440	I loved Lou, I loved what he got to say and I really, I was really impressed with the way
1639440	1643680	that, you know, he presented himself and he was just being very, you know, frank with those
1643680	1647920	responses as well and, you know, he can't talk outside of, you know, the documents and the
1647920	1652800	things that he signed and, you know, all that stuff. So, and I know that's frustrating for a lot of
1652800	1658400	people but I still thought it was very positive. I agree and, you know, I've seen a lot of bitterness
1658400	1664640	online kind of about the efficacy of the hearings. I agree with everybody that I also expected,
1664640	1669120	as did Burleson, first-hand retrieval witnesses or first-hand program witnesses.
1669280	1674720	However, I, yeah, we won't, I'll wait, I'll say that before the interview with Burleson but
1674720	1680560	just Burleson was expecting other people to testify as well or in place of, we didn't specify
1680560	1686240	about that. But I do think one of the key takeaways here with Immaculate Constellation is
1686240	1693120	kind of an existing proof now of DOD lying about a USAP. You know, the protocol for a USAP and
1693120	1697680	unacknowledged special access program is deny, deny, deny. They can't even, they can't even say
1697680	1702080	anything. You know, like even an admission or a denial would like. But if your back's against
1702080	1707680	the wall then you misinform. That's the protocol. Deny. If you cannot deny anymore, you misinform.
1707680	1711440	So, I think this was important to see because, you know, there's so many statements from Susan.
1711440	1716320	Susan Goh is saying Immaculate Constellation is not a program and so forth. I do think the 12-page,
1717360	1722080	you know, report, which is super interesting, which we'll get into in a little bit. You know,
1722080	1726560	Kermit and I have been talking at length about one specific report from there and, of course,
1726640	1730960	the term alien reproduction vehicle, which I kind of got on Schellenberger's a little bit case,
1730960	1735680	a little bit for omitting from his congressional submission. But he didn't even mention that at
1735680	1739920	all in his testimony, which I was a little bit disappointed of. And I even asked Jeremy about
1739920	1743040	that. I said, hey, Jeremy, you know, why didn't he do that? He was like, well, you can just ask
1743040	1746880	him why they lied. He was too hot under the collar to do that. We'll take a quick break,
1746880	1750000	look at a couple of questions. What do you think about Nancy May's selling UFO brain
1750000	1756640	and merch? I think it's a bad taste. Yeah, I will say, you know, seeing kind of the
1757920	1761440	representatives and how they've kind of been tweeting about this, like that seems positive.
1761440	1766960	But then, you know, seeing the merch that's being sold, it's just on the nose, you know,
1766960	1771840	and it's like a UF, it's a shirt of like a UF phone. It's got Nancy May's like in it.
1771840	1777120	I think it's bad taste. I think it's bad taste. I like this idea a lot, Magic, and I will absolutely
1777120	1782880	ask him about it. So, okay, what's your guys' thoughts on the simulation hypothesis?
1783600	1788000	Pretty interesting. Of course, there's a great podcast on the simulation hypothesis that
1788000	1792560	kind of states that in the future, if the civilization has the computing power to conduct
1792560	1796640	a simulation of a whole hypothesis, that means they won't just stop at one simulation. They
1796640	1800160	will conduct numerous, possibly even infinite. And therefore, if there's infinite simulated
1800160	1805120	hypotheses of universes in the future that yours is statistically more likely to be a simulated
1805120	1808960	one. It's interesting, but, you know, I can't prove it. What do you say, Kerm?
1808960	1811840	It's just too much bandwidth for me, man. I just show me an Excel file.
1811840	1817120	He likes money. Yeah, he likes money. I'm into the credits. Show me a 10K. I mean,
1817120	1822800	it's not, I wouldn't be surprised if that's, like, I feel like what Grush said last year,
1822800	1826160	I think, is a pretty good, pretty good description. Holographic.
1826160	1830320	Yeah, he's just like, whatever, he kind of had this line where he's like, you know,
1830320	1833360	you kind of look in places in the universe. It seems like things are just a little too
1834000	1838800	perfect. You know what I mean? And, you know, I don't know. I feel like that's kind of where I
1838800	1842400	kind of stand with this. Like, you know, the more we kind of understand the world around us,
1842400	1847120	it's like we really get to understand, like, why we're here and, like, what's the nature of existence.
1847120	1852320	And yeah, what's interesting, though, is, you know, Rizwan Burke, he's going to be at the,
1852320	1856320	he's going to be at Seoul, and he's going to give a discussion about the simulation.
1856320	1858960	Ooh, that's going to be, we'll have to talk about that post.
1858960	1862320	He also on Joe Rogan said he knew people in the legacy program as well.
1862320	1867600	Diddy. Okay, we'll have to talk about that as well. So, Schellenberger, Lou, Gallaudet,
1867600	1872160	and Gold, I think it was an extremely poor taste for Higgins or whoever it was that
1872160	1877440	was trying to burn Schellenberger's whistleblower. Yeah, I wasn't, I don't know. I thought,
1877440	1882560	I thought Higgins' line of questioning was like kind of half-baked a little bit. And I get,
1882560	1886080	yeah, I get that you guys are trying to figure out what the source is. But like, at the end of
1886080	1890480	the day, Schellenberger was literally said he was willing to go to jail to protect that source.
1890480	1894800	So, you just got to respect that. So, Siwon, thank you again for the next five bucks, man.
1894800	1900080	Yeah, Schrock. So, isn't just a former director of Skunkworks on the USAF advisory board. He
1900080	1905280	probably did about know about the OSAP transfer. So, I really hope we can hear about that at Seoul.
1905280	1907840	So, it would be very interesting to hear from him next week.
1907840	1912560	Gold, Schellenberger, Gallaudet, Elizondo. I know something or someone, I know you're not the
1912560	1918080	biggest Elizondo proponent. The thing that worried me the most about Gallaudet speaking
1918080	1924880	was kind of reinforced. First of all, I loved Tim Gallaudet. Hermit can see, Tim's my boy,
1924880	1931440	we spoke quite a bit. Super nice guy. I've talked to him a lot before he had seen the channel with
1931440	1938960	the USO videos. But I was worried because when Chris Sharpe's reporting on Neuro and undersea
1938960	1943280	crash retrievals came out with Wood Soul Ocean, a graphic institute, and Lockheed Martin Drys
1943280	1949120	Immersible, I reached out to Gallaudet and I just said, hey, sir, can we talk about these
1949120	1953920	underwater crash retrievals? And he told me, I don't know anything about it. And at that point,
1953920	1960160	I rationed, okay, he's bound by NDA. He can't speak about this. It makes sense. I'll back off.
1960160	1964800	But then, of course, at the hearing, he said he'd never signed an NDA towards anything.
1964800	1966240	He did say that. Yeah.
1966240	1972640	That does worry me a little bit. He doesn't know about USO retrievals. Harry, thank you very much.
1973520	1976320	Who was your favorite during the breaks, meetups, and formal chats?
1978000	1980480	Probably Burleson, to be honest.
1981200	1985440	Yeah, I thought our conversation with Burleson, post hearing. And then he was also at the UAPDF,
1986080	1988160	post party as well. We got some FaceTime there as well.
1988720	1994000	It was really great talking to him. He's a sharp cat. We also got to talk to numerous house staffers
1994000	1999920	as well. Oh, yeah. We'll get into that once we finish up the hearings. But we'll just say for
1999920	2004720	now, we got a lot of business cards, which was great. Contact information was exchanged.
2004720	2009440	Okay. Jim Chu says, on what impact, if any, will Trump have on deeper disclosure?
2009440	2014560	I already think that he's making consequential moves by placing men like Rubio in power, which
2014560	2019360	Rubio, of course, has been trying to subpoena and interview witnesses since at least 2008.
2019360	2022480	And Matt Gaetz being the attorney general, that was just announced today. I think that's
2022480	2026720	significant. I think he's setting up a pretty pro-disclosure cabinet.
2026720	2030080	I know there's been a lot of talks as well with this Department of Government Efficiency,
2030080	2034320	which seems to be more and more like a real thing. Elon Musk, Vivek, Rama Swamy, if you guys are
2034320	2038400	watching this stream, I would love to join the effort in specifically trying to audit this
2038400	2044240	legacy program activity. Hey, let's get this man in doge. That'd be pretty cool. So what stuck out
2044240	2051120	to Throsey here was the idea of tracking ARVs. This implies that foreign ARVs are uncontrolled,
2051600	2057840	domestic ARVs. I think both probably remember, this is something that even Congress really got
2057840	2064080	wrong. Immaculate Constellation is not a legacy program. This was made in 2017 in an attempt to,
2064880	2071600	I guess, umbrella over both legacy program and UAP. And it happened concurrent with Lou Elizondo
2072160	2076720	coming out public with the New York Times order. So Immaculate Constellation would not have
2077520	2082080	access. Members of Immaculate Constellation would not have read-on access to, let's say,
2082080	2087840	the Air Force legacy program that tests ARV crap. Possibly. I mean, we don't really know how
2088560	2095120	consolidated those databases are because it does talk about, I think, the overall structure of
2095120	2100080	Immaculate Constellation is like a reporting. So it gets these UFO reports, this raw data that's
2100080	2105200	coming in, and it silos it based on the imagery and the intelligence that they have behind that.
2105280	2111840	So does that database also include stuff pre-2017? Well, I don't really know. But what I will say is,
2112640	2117680	within the Immaculate Constellation report, this 11-page report, it does talk about imagery and
2117680	2124800	human intelligence reports. And the scope of those encounters goes back to 1991. So that's
2124800	2131920	pre-2017. So does Immaculate Constellation have that pre-2017 data? Maybe. It just really depends
2131920	2138000	on what this author of this document had access to. And if it was all IC, Immaculate Constellation.
2138000	2143840	Maybe. But I've also asked some of my friends who are analysts in satellite industry, so they
2143840	2148640	could look back to 1974 for the Koyama incident, and they said, that's too far back. We have a cutoff.
2149360	2156240	So I think for some of these space-based systems, that data is just not available.
2157040	2163120	But I also do think that the programs are even between Army, Navy, and Air Force,
2163120	2167840	probably the three largest legacy programs, that there's very little communication or cross-referencing
2167840	2174960	between those programs. So it'd be interesting to find out who the witness of Schellenberger is,
2174960	2179200	and who ran the Immaculate Constellation program. It was said that this was an individual in the
2179200	2184400	executive branch. Possibly State Department. Possibly State Department. That's at least
2184400	2190560	the witness, I think, Ross Goldhart has said. I think so. But I am of the mind that there are
2191760	2196960	domestic ARBs that probably even the executive branch and Immaculate Constellation has no idea
2196960	2201760	about. Yeah, but also I think probably the most interesting part is that we do have foreign
2201760	2207200	intelligence of foreign ARBs, and those are included within the Immaculate Constellation
2207200	2213040	report. And we have imagery and videos of this stuff. Specifically of the case that occurred
2213040	2218960	over the Indo-Pacific region of a large black triangle, which if that's the case, you know,
2218960	2222640	we were just at the Spy Museum and we saw some imagery of China ripping off and reverse
2222640	2226640	engineering a predator drone. This would also mean that China ripped off and reverse engineered a
2226640	2231760	TR3D. Hey, I do the same thing all the time. Kermit, here's a question for you, sir. There was
2231760	2237040	some speculation regarding the involvement of Pacific architects and engineers outbidding
2237040	2243280	OSAP for the locking materials. Anything there? That's a great question. Yeah, I so I've been
2243280	2248960	referred to Pacific architects and engineers quite some times. As I understand it, they were later
2248960	2256000	required by Lockheed Martin, I think. Yeah, I haven't really looked into it a ton. I know that
2256000	2262320	they did become involved like post OSAP trans like that same timeline still exists. So very
2262320	2268000	interesting, but I will say I think it's a fairly small organization. Like it's mostly like an
2268000	2272880	engineering consulting services group that's I think less than a thousand, five thousand employees.
2272880	2279360	I could be completely wrong here. But yeah, no, I know I know the name Pacific architects. I don't
2279360	2285120	know a ton about it. But yeah, I'll just nod my head and smile. That just means follow up research.
2285120	2291280	So that's awesome. Trump could pardon Trump could pardon anyone under UAP non-disclosure.
2291280	2297680	I think amnesty should be truth and reconciliation. Yeah, truth. Unless it's a it's like a person
2297680	2302880	that has killed somebody for the sake of secrecy. Yeah, like if these are not, I don't know. I don't
2302880	2308400	even know if like the JSOC members in the 2004, if that's a true case, the blue on blue JSOC,
2308400	2312160	we've been killed by Lockheed retrieval members, if that's a true case, and those guys are acting
2312160	2318880	under strict orders. But I don't know if if you're a men in black assassin trying to who visited
2318880	2323680	Mark McCandless's house in 2021, I don't know how much you should receive amnesty.
2323680	2328880	It feels almost like it would be almost like a military version of a record case, right? Because
2328880	2331520	it's like you have all these people working on these different programs following orders. But at
2331520	2335680	the end of the day, who's really making decisions? So if you really want like full disclosure, truth
2335680	2340800	and reconciliation, sending people to jail as well for, you know, illegal activity, I feel like
2340800	2345120	the ultimate responsibility is like the people, you know, Depsec, whatever, that are in these
2345120	2350080	high up positions making these orders, right? So who ultimately is responsible for that? I don't
2350080	2353360	know. We don't know. We're still trying to figure that out. Maybe it's Cheney. He should have been
2353360	2357680	in jail a long time ago. He's probably sits at the top of the pyramid. So Mace is a grifter. I'd
2357680	2361200	like to get your opinion on this. I think she's more of just an opportunist who doesn't really
2361200	2368560	understand maybe some context around UFOs and kind of the disinformating cartoonists and grifters,
2368560	2373680	if you want to call him that. So I understand like calling calling grifter just from seeing the
2373680	2379600	shirt. I totally understand it. But okay, calling calling Mace a grifter. I just I think it's just
2379600	2384320	the poor taste of her. Yeah, it's just poor. I think it's just poor taste. And honestly, I think
2384320	2389200	it's probably like a staffer or something. Yeah. That's, Hey, you know, we're trying to have some
2389200	2393920	UFO brain and merch out there so that, you know, our constituents know, you know, this is this will
2393920	2400480	be. Yeah. So Siwan, thank you again. You talked to a staffer at that the committee had heard about
2400560	2405840	Schrock and his story. Not sure why he didn't testify. I was thinking, yeah, once I once I'd
2405840	2410640	saw a truck was going to talk at Seoul, I was assuming he was going to be one of the witnesses
2410640	2414880	today. That was very surprising for me. So one of the things at Seoul is there's some time for
2414880	2421360	meet and greets and so forth along with the Q&A. So we will I promise you try and pull Schrock for
2421360	2427760	an interview. I would do anything for that. So we'll scroll down here. So this is talking a little
2427760	2432000	bit throws. He's talking a little bit more about Mace. They're selling a platform for fundraising
2432000	2438560	for Republicans. But yes, bad taste. Okay. We all agree there. So here's a question or statement
2438560	2442800	from Hokey. It would be interesting for you to talk with the lawyer in the military space. What
2442800	2447440	are the potential legal mechanisms? 1950s era executive orders, DOE exceptions that could keep
2447440	2452640	this hushed up. I didn't like being a good person to us to talk to. Yeah. And then also, I mean,
2452640	2456880	this is, I mean, at least in the legal financial area, right? Like there's a bunch of stuff in,
2456880	2462960	you know, the SEC Act, the Code of Federal Regulations that allow not just for like the
2462960	2466720	president, but also like to your point, right, Department of Energy, they can provide like
2466720	2472720	the executive agencies can provide these exemptions specifically for corporations or people or
2472720	2477680	agencies that are involved in, you know, above black or above board activities like that.
2477680	2481040	So I'm just trying to look at the questions because then we'll get back to the hearings.
2482000	2488320	So Nell, I only heard from the disclosure Mike account, and he was also talking about other
2488320	2494160	witnesses, like firsthand triangle witnesses. So maybe this was, maybe his sources
2494960	2498160	were a little bit behind. Maybe there was something that was supposed to happen. But
2498160	2504560	no, I personally heard none of Nell supposing to have testified. Yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to
2504560	2511280	hear him. Okay. Sorry. Okay. A question about Michael, does he know when he'll be able to go
2511280	2518160	back to the black side? I do not know. I have no idea. Michael used to work at Bigelow and that
2518160	2522960	wasn't mentioned in his bio. Also NASA is the, yeah, I've ever worked for NASA is not transparent.
2522960	2526480	I can give you guys, I mean, I think I've talked about it multiple times, like in the Moon dust
2526480	2533200	video where NASA has lied. Anyone see SAIC took its biggest one day loss today? No, actually,
2533600	2538000	today, today with post earnings, what's going on here? Oh no. I don't know. Yeah. Well,
2538000	2542080	let Kermit pull that up while I get, while I get the next question. The one day we go run the streets
2542080	2548720	looking at museums, the SAIC tanks. How did I have such a great seat? I had a good friend who
2548720	2554720	helped me get media for this really good friend. I'm very thankful too. And so I owe all of that
2554720	2559360	to that, that person. Have you guys read the 11 page paper? Yes, we're about to talk about it too
2559360	2570800	once we finish up with the hearings as well. Okay, let's see. Eli, shout out event horizon.
2572000	2577360	It's not just at SAIC. It's actually a, so what's going on with SAIC is actually being seen at
2577360	2582720	Litos, Amentum and a couple other defense primes. It seems to be some type of uncertainty in the
2582720	2587440	defense market at its current, at this current moment. I wonder what's causing that. I wonder
2587440	2594080	what's causing that. I'm just looking for, for triangles. Siwon, thank you. You are giving a
2594080	2600000	lot of cash. Thank you so much, man. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Thank you
2600000	2606800	as well, Jimmy Shoe. I'm looking for questions right now, guys. Yeah, I think I saw this as
2606800	2610480	well to Douglas Dean Johnson and Kirkpatrick provided several points too. I don't know,
2611680	2615200	Debunk, I think he might have raised some interesting points. I haven't fully read what,
2615200	2622400	what he said. Yeah, so his, his belief, right, I think it's kind of just scrutinizing and assessing
2622400	2628400	this document, right? So first off, this is written by somebody in the Department of Defense and then
2628400	2633440	was approved by the Department of State Public Affairs. Kirkpatrick basically said in his response,
2633440	2637920	this is completely bogus. This is completely made up. This isn't what happens. Not to mention,
2637920	2643360	this 11 page document is not on any official letterhead. It does not seem to be any sort of like,
2643840	2648720	formalized or standard report memo. Otherwise, it's coming out officially of an agency. This
2648720	2654000	seems like, I don't know, like it could be somebody typing up this report. Is this somebody in the
2654000	2659840	government? Is this somebody that's not in the government? Ultimately, we don't, we don't really
2659840	2665040	entirely know, but I think some of the things that we would expect from government documents are
2665040	2669440	absent from this 11 page report. And then especially now that it's been entered into the
2669440	2672720	congressional record and everyone's kind of talking about it, it's like, obviously, the
2672720	2679600	scrutiny has just increased. Yeah. Yeah. So how did the panel get selected? Felt more like a
2679600	2684960	variety show, which I agree with you. I have no idea how the panel got selected. All I know is
2684960	2689680	that for this hearing specifically from Burleson, as well as a person I talked to connected with
2689680	2695040	the intelligence community at the UAPDF, there have been other instances where witnesses were
2695040	2700960	intimidated almost like up to the time they were supposed to, supposed to testify. So, you know,
2700960	2707760	I'm not exactly sure the issues here, but I don't know how this was selected. I mean, I
2707760	2711360	probably would have chosen a little bit of a different lineup or possibly even more witnesses,
2711360	2716560	but, you know, I'm not necessarily sure. I felt like they did a good job just, again, kind of
2716560	2722400	selecting a group of people that kind of represented different aspects kind of of this. And you have
2722400	2727840	like naval intelligence, you know, journalism, science. I thought that that was a pretty good
2727920	2734480	mix of people. Right. I do think that the hearings were varied enough from last years.
2734480	2740480	However, we need first-hand, not first-hand experiencers, but first-hand whistleblowers
2740480	2744080	involved. Like touch the craft. You've been in the basement, you've seen the stuff. Yes.
2745120	2750320	But I don't know, saying you've seen the stuff, mentioning the technologies and mentioning the
2750320	2754880	locations would then be violating your special access programs that you've been read into in
2754880	2760720	legacy. So the consequences for that would likely be severe. Yeah. And I imagine those are the type
2760720	2766560	of people that would be told on their way to testify, to turn back or bad things will happen.
2766560	2772800	Yeah, that could be happening. Crackerjack, thank you so much for the 20 big month. It is a big
2772800	2778720	month. We got a lot of stuff and we still got soul coming up. Traveling across the country for UAPs.
2779440	2784560	So, sorry, I'm just looking at, did you already talk about the Kuwait UAP that
2784560	2789600	Sheldon Berger mentioned? Not yet, which we will. I'd also, in the report, which I thought was
2789600	2794560	interesting, was the mention of the Orbs flying circles around the F-22s, right?
2794560	2801600	Yep. And then also, I think that same incident at the Orbs escorted the F-22 out of the
2802560	2808800	missionary. So this pilot is on their way to do this mission. And then all of a sudden,
2808800	2813200	they get surrounded by Orbs that are doing all these tricks around it. And then the Orbs are
2813200	2818000	like, get out. As I was reading that report, I'm just trying to picture it for myself. I'm like,
2818000	2824720	that's got to be airing on. And that reminds me of the Donald Trump on JRE, who talks about speaking
2825040	2831760	to F-22 pilots who observe. Yeah, specifically F-22. So do those correlate? I don't think it's
2831760	2836320	a stretch to say yes. William, I've been awesome, man. How are you doing? Sorry I've been a little
2836320	2841520	dark between Jesse and this and soul has so much going on. I do have a project coming out and it
2841520	2847520	should be within the week that I'm really excited. Really excited. Yes, we talked about this. It
2847520	2851120	appears the report came from Corbell, not Schellenberger. A lot of drama around there.
2851120	2856560	Schellenberger just had an interview with Jesse. I haven't had the opportunity to watch it yet,
2856560	2861200	but I would like to see that. I would like to see that. So let me just look for questions here,
2861200	2865520	guys, so then we'll keep talking. You guys asked so many great questions, especially the stuff
2865520	2871040	of current. Keep them coming. So yeah. Have you seen the Beyond Paradigm podcast with putoff and
2871040	2875520	graves? Do you think that it's important that somebody who just worked with putoff just testified?
2875520	2879680	I have not seen the podcast with putoff and graves. Have you? I would like to watch it though,
2880240	2885680	because we've got to meet Ryan Graves as well, and he's extremely kind. What's the chatter with
2885680	2892560	the grush op-ed? Well, Burleson will make some comments on it, but he thought the reason as to
2892560	2898480	why the American public has not seen it yet was not his place to say, but he did have some comments
2898480	2905680	on it, which is pretty interesting. Okay, perfect. Thank you for putting the question. How was the
2905680	2910160	UAPDF dinner? Any key points there that caught your attention? Did congressional individuals and
2910160	2916720	staffer show interest? Thank you. That's a perfect segue question. So Lester Nair, guys, if you guys,
2916720	2922000	you guys probably all know Lester Nair. If you don't, I'd really follow him. He's a member of UAP
2922000	2927120	Caucus, brilliant individual. This morning he tweeted, I have a lot of thoughts about yesterday.
2927120	2931200	I'll just start with saying being here in person is like seeing the situation in full color,
2931840	2935600	watching only the hearings and not all the things happening in real life before and
2935600	2941120	after around it. It's like watching it in black and white. And this is a statement we've talked
2941120	2945920	about. I couldn't agree more with guys. The hearings were good. I love the time there,
2945920	2956080	but I was blown away by UAPDF. Seeing the House and congressional interest and support from both
2956080	2962240	Republicans and Democrats, seeing the unity around some individuals, seeing members connected
2962240	2966960	with the intelligence community. There were numerous staffers as well that we just talked about that
2967600	2972640	Kermit and I connected with a lot of business cards to speak to staffers who are really
2972640	2979200	interested in the subject. And I'll keep going on, but give me your thoughts on UAPDF.
2979200	2985040	Yeah. First off, I just want to say Lester Nair, thank you kindly for letting us in.
2985680	2991600	It was extraordinary just to be able to just be amongst everybody and just have the opportunity
2991600	2996960	just to be able to attend and get to talk to everybody. Yeah. I mean, pretty much a lot
2996960	3000400	of the witnesses were there. A lot of people around them, Ryan Graves, who attended the
3000400	3005680	hearings and was also at the UAPDF. And then some of the representatives, Senator Rounds,
3005680	3011120	gave the opening address and actually awarded Lou Elizondo a framed copy of the legislation
3011120	3017760	that was cool to the NDAA last year, which I think that that speaks volumes to the support and
3017760	3024160	just the persistence, just kind of the persistence that Senator Rounds and these people in Congress
3024160	3029680	have about really trying to get transparency and enacting legislation to get that. And none of them
3029680	3036560	are like, like none of them are kooky or dubious characters as Green Street would say. Burrelson
3036560	3041280	went on stage. He said, guys, like I've said this before, I'll say it again. I'm skeptic about
3041280	3047760	everything. But there's obvious blockages here from places outside of Congress. And I want to
3047760	3052080	get to the bottom of this and so forth. So these guys are all saying that they don't have all the
3052080	3058000	pieces, but they're pretty darn open-minded. We'll just say Burrelson has not been at rest
3058000	3063920	since Brush spoke last year. He has not been just relaxing and chilling. Either has Birchette
3064560	3070480	and other people. We got the board of directors for the UAP-DF, including Gary Nolan, Nell and
3070480	3076720	Elizondo, the advisory board, Timothy Gallaudet, Chris Mellon, Kirk McConnell. Interesting about
3076720	3082320	Chris Mellon. We went to the art museum today and the Mellon family donated all of the best
3082320	3088240	pieces there. Substantially all, yeah. And we got a document here, an actual picture of the six
3088240	3095120	observables of UAP craft, including positive lift, hypersonic velocities, instantaneous acceleration,
3095120	3100400	low observability, trans-medium travel and biological effects. But what I would just like
3100400	3104480	to say about the UAP-DF is there were some individuals there that I have wanted to connect to
3104480	3112400	for a very long time that I finally got the chance to sit and speak with. And I couldn't be happier.
3112400	3116160	So do we want to talk about, I guess, our conversation with Leslie?
3116240	3118960	Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll talk about Leslie Kane a little bit.
3118960	3120720	Yeah, yeah, yeah. How was that conversation?
3120720	3127760	So for the Brad Swarinson ARV project, analyzing emails and transcripts, I found one mention
3127760	3134080	that between 2000 and 2003, Mark had sent Leslie Kane a copy of Fluxliner as drawn by Brad.
3134880	3140000	And so I bring this up to Leslie Kane and she couldn't remember it because at that time she
3140000	3146560	was working with Greer. She didn't talk to McCandlishe after 2004 when she left with Greer,
3146560	3151840	didn't know all about that. And so asked me to explain. And Leslie Kane kind of had no idea of
3151840	3156880	the Brad Swarinson interview with Aviation Week in Space Technology. And so Shera and I were
3156880	3162480	talking for like 10 minutes straight. She was gobsmacked about the death threats from Swarinson.
3162480	3166480	She couldn't believe it. But then she and I were talking about that. We were talking about the
3166480	3172800	Edwards case and Wittness Ed, Kexburg as well. And Leslie Kane is just one of the smartest,
3172800	3178080	nicest people I've ever spoken to. There was a group of journalists nearby. I sat near them at
3178080	3182480	the press conference and they were kind of hounding around, really nice people kind of
3182480	3186400	wanting to get a picture of what was going on. So then afterwards they talked to me for like 30
3186400	3192720	minutes on how I source methods. But Leslie Kane was so cool to talk to. She's so small and she's
3192720	3197520	so cute with her like, gray hair that's puffing out in every direction. It was, it was really
3197520	3203600	fantastic just watching y'all both just go and add it on Kexburg and Torrance and it was just,
3203600	3207280	it was like a meeting of the minds and I was just like, I was just blessed just to like sit and watch
3207280	3212000	it, you know? Because she stepped away from the case for a while. I think with, I think with a lot
3212000	3217120	of journalists, and it makes sense, right? When you have to, you know, meet a quota for maybe a
3217120	3221280	publication or some forth, at some point, you got to step away from the case. Yeah. And so with
3221280	3225840	Kexburg, you know, Kexburg, I think she hit a dead end, which I understand too, because I also told
3225840	3231120	her about kind of Romansky and some of the FOIA dead ends with talking to his kids who he mentioned
3231120	3239360	on the Jim Montell show, words of night access to, or told not to speak about Romansky. So in my
3239360	3243760	opinion, Kexburg has hit someone of a dead end, but, you know, her eyes kind of lit up when I told
3243760	3248640	her about the Sorens and stuff, because, you know, that case really is alive and well, especially
3248640	3253680	with ARV and Immaculate Constellation. But yeah, I mean, it's made the new cycle yet again. And as
3253680	3260240	we know, this, the, the McCandler Sorens and Story is one of the original like sources of the ARV
3260240	3265600	reproduction vehicle concept. So, you know, if we, if, if we really want to understand the
3265600	3271040	ARV and the RV, man, like we need to, we need to, we need, I don't know, we need to drag people in
3271040	3276480	and start getting them testified. Well, and I really need to stress this, because I think Corbell
3276480	3282320	and Knapp discussed this as well as some others. The term, excuse me, ARV did not originate with
3282320	3289200	Greer. This UFO researcher, Bill Hamilton was the first person to ever speak about ARV. And this
3289200	3295520	term was given to him by Brad and Bill Scott. And in 1991, he was the first one to publish
3295520	3300560	the term ARV to text unrelated to the story. I think he made a misprint here. He called it an
3300560	3305760	alien replicated vehicle, not alien reproduction vehicle, but use the term ARV. And so in my tweet
3305760	3309120	where I kind of called out Schellenberger a little bit for saying, Hey, why did you take this out?
3309120	3315440	It's because ARV is not attributing alien and extra terrestrials to this vehicle. ARV is the
3315440	3320400	specific term. It's like the brand name, like Sprite to lemon line soda that Brad Sorensen was
3320400	3324480	told by the individual showing off the craft at Northern Air Force Base, which is a story, I
3324480	3330400	believe to be true. ARV specifically was said, these are alien reproduction vehicles. So, you know,
3330400	3334560	by saying alien reproduction vehicle, it's not just extraterrestrial. It's a, I hate to use this
3334640	3340080	word because I think it's overused, but it is a kind of a nuance term, right? Yeah. But so Leslie
3340080	3346160	Kane, I'm sending her some of the ARV stuff and she and I are going to get cracking and talk a
3346160	3350400	little bit more about that. So it's exciting. If I could get her on the show or talk to her,
3350400	3353600	because we were waiting for like 20 minutes to speak to her. There were some
3354400	3359840	chatty Cathy speaking to her right before we got up. And it's okay. I mean, for some
3360800	3366160	people like us, it's, it's a little shocking to be in kind of a mixture with
3367040	3371920	some of the people we were around. Yeah, I would say overall, it just felt very surreal. I mean,
3371920	3375840	for me, you know, this is, I guess the first time I've come out and like, Hey, I'm Kermit,
3375840	3380400	I'm probably probably about years or whatever. And then also just seeing a lot of people that
3380400	3385760	have been like following and talking with like on Twitter, Reddit, you know, all these different
3385840	3390400	social media platforms and then seeing a lot of those people in person. And then like,
3390400	3394800	you know, the UAPDF party, it's like, you know, who are kind of worried if we weren't, if we're
3394800	3398960	going to get in or not, it was all this, you know, kind of anxiety about it. And then just being in
3398960	3403040	the room, it was like, at first part, I was just like anxious because I'm like, geez, like, I'm so
3403040	3409680	out of place. But I also just felt like just so happy and just so blessed just to like have, have
3409680	3414320	that experience. Everybody there was brilliant. Everybody there had something to offer and talk
3414320	3419440	about. And it was just a really special group of people. It was really darn cool. Absolutely.
3419440	3423520	And it was really cool. I also, we got to talk to James Fox quite a bit as well.
3424240	3428080	Really excited for the program. We're going to see that next week at Sol. But
3428080	3434400	James Fox is one cool dude out on Apple TV, November, December 15. I think so. He is one
3434400	3439920	cool dude guys. James Fox is awesome to talk to. Yep. We were, yeah, we, we talked a lot about
3440560	3447120	that. And then also just going to Sol and, you know, just his doc, like his, his work with Virginia
3447120	3453040	a little bit as well. So fantastic guy. I would say a lot of the people that we met yesterday
3453040	3458480	were very nice. You know, they're very interested in talking to us and learning from our perspective
3458480	3463280	and our experience and kind of like, you know, our reason, our why of like being this topic. So
3463280	3467440	I found it pretty cool because I find as like a content creator in the sphere, there's a lot of
3467680	3471840	like hoarding of information, I would say, and kind of unwillingness to share and collaborate.
3471840	3477680	So being around this group of people who are just so willing to speak and talk was, was really
3477680	3481520	cool. You know, so many people asked me like, who do I work for? They say nobody. I, you know,
3481520	3486000	I work for myself. I'm just here because I'm intellectually curious about aliens. Yeah.
3486000	3490640	Some people would kind of give a look at like, really? Yeah. Like Burlton asked me that and I
3490640	3496000	just know like I'm self published. I just create documentaries. And so that was, that was really
3496000	3501600	cool guys. I'm on a first name basis with Rhett Burlton. Did you notice the witnesses were as
3501600	3505200	nervous in person as they appeared on TV? I understand it's a nerve wracking situation,
3505200	3510000	but they seem very nervous. To me, they did not look nervous at all. The most nervous person was
3510000	3516560	Jeremy Cordell. I wasn't in the room. So I wouldn't know. I will say, I mean, they didn't seem nervous
3516560	3521360	at least when I got to meet a lot of them at the UAPDF. You know, if these people are all engaged
3521440	3526240	in some massive psychological operation, they're doing a really, really good job of it. Because
3526240	3530160	it did not seem like they were engaged in fraud or anything like that. And I think Michael Gold
3530160	3535200	had one heck of a time because he was a, he was just kind of eating candy the whole time. And
3535200	3541600	then afterwards I got to speak to him and he was just so, he was like all smiles that he got to
3541600	3548080	talk. So, you know, it's always nice meeting the men behind the mics and talking to these people.
3548080	3554240	Well, I mean, there's certainly, I had been a little harsh, I think, on loot lately with some of
3554240	3560560	the presentation stuff and just sort of the questions that still remain and are really
3560560	3565200	valid about his background, as well as his work at CIFA, the Counterintelligence Field Activity.
3565200	3573040	But, you know, meeting and talking to these people was really great. So, yes, okay.
3573040	3578000	While this part was people reporting loss of time and feelings of unease, let's remember the story
3578000	3582880	of Jonathan Wagan, who in 1997 in Peru, when he and his fellow Marines allegedly found a crash
3582880	3588960	saucer as they got within close proximity, they felt like intense fear and unease. And, you know,
3588960	3593120	if the infographics whistleblower story is true, crash retrieval operators have to have
3593120	3599360	grounding mechanisms because your cognition is so affected. Well, it's a, yeah, I've heard from
3599360	3603920	other people's experiences as well that loss of time is actually quite common. I think there's
3603920	3608640	something to do with the warping of gravity and time and just how that affects our perception.
3608640	3613440	That definitely tracks. There's another point I was going to say to that, but I'm completely
3613440	3620320	blanking on it. Is it about fear or? Fear. Oh, actually, what I was going to say is, you know,
3620320	3625040	actually, the loss of time is also featured in the X-Files, too. Whenever Fox Motor, whenever he has
3625040	3629200	these encounters, if you see his, you know, extraterrestrial vehicle, he'll check his
3629200	3633200	watch because he's trying to see if the, you know, the timer's gone. So I don't know. I, I, I
3633200	3636880	sort of watched the X-Files after I really started getting into UAPs and I'm like,
3637680	3641200	interesting. Like, this is talking, this is a lot of the stuff I've been like researching it.
3641200	3644160	This is a little on the nose. X-Files is a big thing. What's going on?
3644160	3648960	And I'll talk about one very specific thing in the X-Files in my next video. How much of the
3648960	3654320	UAP topic occupies your daily life researching, editing? If I'm not with the girlfriend talking
3654320	3660960	to Kermit on the phone, training Jiu Jitsu, lifting weights or doing other work, I'm doing this. So
3660960	3667760	and I know you didn't ask me, but what I will say is it's probably, it is my, it is my intellectual
3667760	3674640	curiosity. So after, after work, after dinner, after I'm done hanging out with my friends and
3674640	3681120	watching Instagram reels, I'm scrolling the CIA's reading room and the Navy's reading room as well.
3681120	3688320	Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I'll say if I'm not, this takes up probably most of my time outside the
3688320	3694080	lady. I always have like nine or 10 PDFs. I'm reading escape velocity. Thank you so much.
3694080	3698720	This is for our, oh, thank you. Let's catch up soon. Absolutely. Thank you so much.
3698720	3703280	I appreciate it, man. I appreciate it a lot. And yes, sorry I missed your call today. It's been
3703280	3710560	hectic as been very hectic, dude, but thank you so much. Levi, it was nice to meet you too, man.
3711520	3715760	Wanted to ask if you got any impressions hearing roundspeak at the UAPDA would be
3715760	3719520	reintroduced independently. I wouldn't be surprised. He mentioned it a couple of times.
3719520	3721920	There seems to be very strong support. Yeah.
3721920	3725120	To reintroduce seems to be a little bit of spite that it wasn't passed.
3725120	3728240	Yeah. He seemed pretty unhappy. So it was mentioned a lot.
3728240	3734560	So Juan, thank you again, dude. Holy cow. Do you believe SSCI know some UAPs are NHI and are aware
3734560	3742320	of the legacy program? Senate probably. Yeah. Senate probably. Especially
3742880	3748880	House, I think like a house is really still trying to get answers on this. But as far as we know,
3748880	3755360	Senate has been on this trail. Like they had almost a year, a six months to a year head start
3755920	3760160	over the house and their investigations. Yeah. That's at least what I was told.
3760240	3765040	Okay. This is a good question. What alleged NHI technology would you both like to most know
3765040	3771840	everything about things? I would like, I don't, that's actually a tough one. I've grappled with
3771840	3776880	this question a lot. So I'll let you go first, Grimmit. You just throw me the. Yeah, you go first, man.
3779200	3783920	I want to, I think the electrogravity is probably the first thing I want to look at.
3783920	3789280	I want to, I just, I just want to know like if it was actually a thing, you know, also just by the
3789280	3795280	way, like, come on. So the B2, I don't know if you guys know this, but the B2 has a technology on
3795280	3798960	board. I think it's called the inertial mass reduction or something like that. Basically,
3798960	3804560	it uses like electromagnetic, like high voltage electricity through the wings to reduce the
3804560	3809840	weight of the airframe. So it's like less, less, less heavy in the air. So it's a little bit more
3809840	3814880	maneuverable. I just think that's very interesting, you know, up to I think, and that's basically
3814880	3817840	electrogravity. If you want to, if you want to kind of think about it like that. I mean,
3817840	3822880	I'm not a scientist. Again, I'm going to count it. But that's probably one of the first things I
3822880	3828000	would be interested in. I'd say novel propulsion and then energy would be the next one. Like how,
3828000	3832640	how is that propulsion like being energized? That's kind of one and two for me.
3832640	3838560	So specific technology, because I can't really go with the craft, I would like to know
3839360	3843600	about the piece of technology that RA described that was the weapons technology.
3843600	3844560	The tablet?
3844560	3848320	Yes. That was showing the symbology. He didn't know if it was in his head or not.
3849040	3851280	So that, that would, that would be one of mine.
3853760	3859120	Sorry. Sorry, getting through these and I'm going through. Thank you. Will be Milo. Pretty
3859120	3864960	impressive. You are pretty impressive. Thank you so much. And so one again. Thank you, dude. Holy
3864960	3869280	cow. And Chris Sharp collab would go insane. Well, you know, Chris Sharp wasn't there,
3869280	3874160	but I got to make a heck of a lot of connections. So I would love to talk crash retrievals with
3874160	3879680	Sharp. In fact, you know, I'd like to meet him in person. So, you know, maybe we'll get a London
3879680	3888000	trip going in because I'd really like to meet him. UAP is across the pond. So JC was not testifying.
3888000	3893200	That is an interesting observation. Why would he be nervous? I don't know, but he just, when I was
3893200	3897200	talking to him before the hearings, he was just like, okay, now I need to center myself a little bit.
3897760	3901680	So. Oh, okay. I just, I didn't, I didn't know what JC was at first.
3901680	3907200	Did you talk with anyone about remote viewing? Yeah, quite a bit. Specifically, Chris from
3907200	3914160	Area 52 channel. He was with, he's really cool, by the way. You got to talk to him too from Area 52.
3914160	3918640	He actually says he has had experience with remote viewing. So I'm going to link up and talk with him
3918640	3923520	and, you know, see if he can do some, some sort of demonstrations or proof of concept because,
3923520	3927520	you know, I'm sure you feel kind of the same, same way as me, but this is one of the toughest
3927520	3931520	things for me to grab my head around and grapple just because I'm so unfamiliar with the topic.
3931680	3936960	Yeah. The only time it was really discussed was kind of talking about like Ed May's work in the
3936960	3941280	1990s and how that got transferred into that certain private corporation that we're interested in.
3941280	3944480	Was it Mays or Luna that also talked about craft flown with mind?
3945200	3950880	Bind body. That was craft connection. Luna, I think was mind body. She said it was a mind
3950880	3955680	body connection. That was interesting. That was very interesting. Okay. This is just a comment.
3955680	3959840	Diana Posolka said on a pod, Tim Taylor, AKA Tyler told her ex files had real consultants from the
3959840	3966720	program. Yep. Yeah. I would agree. I would agree with this. Holy crap. Snapple. Thank you so much.
3967440	3972320	BJJ practitioners. Where do you train? I mean, that is just so kind of you. Thank you. I'll be
3972320	3978560	sharing this loop with my boy Kermit here. Thank you so much. Sorry. I'm just looking at, okay,
3978560	3982720	questions. Yes. Thank you guys. What actions moving forward? Are you guys looking for Congress to
3982720	3987200	take and what would indicate action on the information to discuss discussed in this hearing?
3987760	3992080	That's a great question. For me specifically, what actions moving forward? Witnesses need to
3992080	3997520	be subpoenaed and this needs to be done in a setting outside of Arrow. I spoke with Burleson
3997520	4004560	about this and there are witnesses. I have talked about publicly and not publicly that
4004560	4011840	information has been passed on for him to get subpoenaed. Yeah. I feel like the more interesting
4011840	4015600	people to talk to at this point are the ones that are not going to be super cooperative because
4015600	4019280	I think the majority of them are probably a little bit more in the know than people that
4019280	4025120	are more transparent about this. That's just my take on this. I also want to see Congress
4025120	4031360	actually investigating the forensic audit trail. I want them either getting a GAO audit done,
4031360	4037920	a DOGE audit, this Department of Government Efficiency stuff. I want them to start making
4037920	4043680	progress on figuring out how the funding is happening and if there's taxpayer dollars or
4043680	4048320	private money that's involved because I think ultimately that's I think the American people
4048320	4052880	deserve to know and the Congress people themselves said it multiple times like we are going to find
4052880	4058080	out about this. That's something I want them desperately to follow up on. I think this is
4058080	4060880	a good question. Why do you think we haven't seen any new evidence like videos or pics?
4062160	4066240	Of course, you could reference why a lot of people I think are kind of disappointed there
4066240	4072880	wasn't such evidence shown at the hearings. However, I think the info here is a little bit
4072880	4076320	more complicated because if we're talking about immaculate constellation, for example, and
4076880	4080080	some of the imagery there, Kermit talked about this earlier, but it's not like a satellite
4080080	4086480	feeds are giving you a steady 4K recording picture. No, you're giving data. You're just
4086480	4093120	giving streams of data and I think anomalies are noticed in the data for objects in picture or
4094000	4099680	there's various conditions to kind of identify what the satellite systems for NRO and NGA and
4099680	4104960	stuff are looking at. At this point, this data is filtered and if it's picked up by immaculate
4104960	4110400	constellation and so forth, it's siloed away quickly. Another thing I'll add as well is like
4110960	4115200	if you're just looking at ARRO and you're looking at the progress that ARRO has made,
4115200	4119040	by the way, they just released a new report, a historical records report, where they talked
4119040	4122480	about some of the new cases and morphology and the progress that ARRO has been making.
4122480	4126560	I like the report. I'm curious to know what the chat's thoughts are this evening about that as
4126560	4133040	well, but what I will say is ARRO has indicated they are building more instrument platforms and so
4133040	4137840	I think as they're starting to build, I think it was called the Gremlin system, which is like
4137840	4143600	hyper spectral imagery. As these offices and as other organizations start to
4145040	4150080	parse that data and they start to look at that and they can take intelligence from it,
4150080	4153360	they can scrub it to make sure there's no classified information, I think we're going to
4153360	4157520	start to see that going forward, but I think it's really just been the instruments, the technology
4157520	4161760	to see this stuff, it's just had to catch up recently. And then somebody asked the question
4161760	4168240	and you relate it, which is a good question. If Sean Kirkpatrick saw no, thought all UAP was
4168240	4172800	prosaic, why have these Gremlin systems and advanced sensory data have been introduced?
4172800	4176560	That was a random question from a random person on Twitter, but I thought it was a very, very
4176560	4182880	good question because it's like Kirkpatrick, when he was running ARRO, he had the main line
4182880	4189040	narrative of most, if not all UAP are prosaic, the people that are witnesses are either misinformed
4189040	4193280	or they're providing disinformation to Congress for their own financial benefit, whatever.
4194800	4198640	But at the same breath, it's like, okay, Kirkpatrick, you're saying UFOs aren't real,
4198640	4203760	but you're spending a bunch of money on cameras that can look at things that aren't visible to the
4203760	4208240	human eye. Why? And speaking of Kirkpatrick, I thought it was mighty funny to see Tim
4209120	4214880	go after Kirkpatrick in both his testimony and congressional submission and Kirkpatrick
4214880	4219840	kind of fire back like it was a high school drama. He's just mad, I didn't hire him.
4220880	4225360	Kirkpatrick is so hot under the collar. I'm sure everybody here has seen his
4225360	4230560	interview on Event Horizon. Kirkpatrick is just, he never makes himself look good.
4230560	4235920	Well, let's not forget his LinkedIn letter after the Grush hearing that posted the same
4235920	4240160	day after the multi-date Grush. He was so petty with Grush. Yeah.
4240160	4244000	So Area 52 has been going over the 4chan leak from last year. Very interesting stuff. What are
4244000	4248800	your thoughts on it? My thoughts are I plan to make a full video about it because there's just
4248800	4255280	a lot of interesting tidbits. The 4chan leaker? Yeah, the 4chan leaker, if nobody knows, it's
4255280	4261040	an alleged testimony off of 4chan, which of course is going to raise some red flags because
4261040	4266960	4chan is kind of just a place for a lot of self-deprecating funny people to post about
4266960	4272240	wild stuff. But the theory behind this is that there's basically a hamburger-shaped
4272240	4277760	self-replicating craft that patrols our ocean non-human that custom builds UAP for specific
4277760	4283120	mission purposes. And this is part of the reason that crash is occurring, thus retrievals, because
4283760	4288000	this specific facility generally doesn't care what happens to its used up product.
4288800	4294560	Well, it's because the UFOs that are coming from this area, whatever this craft is,
4295440	4301520	they seem to be just built for spec, built for that mission. And so it's almost disposable,
4301520	4305360	right? So sometimes these things aren't perfectly built. They crash and then we pick it up.
4305360	4309600	My take on it is that that story is very interesting and it sounds like something the
4309600	4313200	United States maybe would be very interested in doing, but I'll say no more.
4314000	4318000	So William says, do you think it will be different on the issues of UFOs now that
4318000	4322880	Trump is president? Absolutely. I personally do. Just because I think part of it he has
4323600	4328400	spoken about UFOs openly, so I think he'll be more receptive and reporters and media will be more
4329280	4333680	interested to ask him. And I think with some of the people he's positioned in power might be
4333680	4339120	far more willing to work with him. We'll see how Marco Rubio works with Trump. Trump used to
4339120	4345120	call him Little Marco. Yeah, but I feel like that was a lot of just political
4346320	4351280	swagger. He's just trying to beat Rubio on the election. I don't think he holds that against him.
4353920	4362640	He's just teasing him, I don't know. But I will say Trump has indicated that he's not only interested
4362640	4367920	in getting disclosure about UAPs, but also like the JFK records, 9-11, all these other
4368400	4372960	issues and things that we've been talking about in terms of improper government oversight or
4372960	4379040	possible malfeasance. He wants truth on not just UAPs, just like truth in general. I think that
4379040	4385680	that's a good idea of what we're going to see the next four years. So Shardful, what are your
4385680	4390320	thoughts on Boebert talking about the rumors on the Hill about DoD involved in genetic manipulation?
4390720	4393600	Interesting. First of all, I thought her line of speaking,
4395920	4401280	like I understand a lot of people right after election want to bring some
4401280	4406160	political jargon into something, but I thought her talking about the last election and so forth
4406160	4410800	was a little bit of a poor taste. It's already difficult to get the subject taken seriously.
4410800	4417120	So you want questions as directed and purposeful as possible, talking about birds being drones.
4417120	4422000	Birds aren't real. Yeah, when you say that, it's just you're making it disingenuous and it
4422000	4428080	honestly felt like the lines of questioning prior to Boebert taking the stage. It was very
4428080	4431440	good. It was leading somewhere. There were some very interesting things and then all of a sudden
4431440	4436160	Boebert gets up and is like birds aren't real and Biden got 81 million votes and it felt for a brief
4436160	4440160	moment like the air was sucked out and the energy was sucked out for a minute.
4440160	4443280	Maybe there is some interesting research to be done about genetic manipulation,
4443280	4446640	but now that she said that, that's associated with conspiracies like birds.
4447200	4453200	Yeah, but it makes you wonder like, okay, Boebert is at least aware of this, but is the other part
4453200	4458560	of the UAP caucus like as Burleson, as Birchhead, as Moskowitz, as Luna, the guys that we know on
4458560	4463200	the Hill that are interested in this, are they also hearing about this too? Because I know Colt's
4463200	4468800	heart, he speculated on his live stream. I don't know the speculation, but kind of saying like,
4468800	4474400	watch this space a little bit because it seems that there are possibly credible allegations
4474400	4479760	about a hybridization program that have reached Congress and that might be something that will
4479760	4485920	be talked about in further hearings. I think GS15 John Ramirez has talked about that on public
4485920	4491520	forums as well. I can't quite remember, but Truthsau says, who specifically would use a
4491520	4496960	peanut to testify? One, Ed from Edwards. Two and three, I can't necessarily say. What about you,
4497040	4497520	Kermit?
4500560	4503600	Probably Deputy Secretary David Turk of the Department of Energy.
4504240	4507520	Oh, we walked by the DOE today. We did walk by the Forest Hall building.
4507520	4511200	We took pictures outside the James Forest Hall Department of Energy building to make chat.
4511200	4520320	It was a great time. Yeah, I would subpoena. Definitely, without naming names, some folks
4520320	4528640	in the Air Force that oversee experimental test wings at Edwards and the Deputy Director of,
4528640	4531920	sorry, the Director of Global Acts, Office of Global Acts. Those are my top three.
4534400	4539120	Or, thank you so much for the 50s. This is for my boys, 10 and 12. Well, thank you. That's
4539120	4544160	extremely nice. Role model and inspiration, thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words
4544160	4549120	and also extend those same courtesy to Kermit because he is killing it. You're getting a lot
4549120	4555040	of love on this show too, man. Thank you so much. Falcon, Ed, do you think Avi Loeb is an ally or not?
4555040	4562720	Yes, I have a friend who speaks extremely highly of Avi and are trying to maybe facilitate a meeting
4562720	4566240	with himself and me. I'd really like to talk to him. Do you have any thoughts on Avi?
4567520	4574880	I think he's doing a really, really good thing. I think it's so great that the same
4574880	4580800	organization that John Mack was a part of and there was a lot of issues with his internal review.
4580800	4587200	Now, Harvard is kind of supporting Avi Loeb having a more serious inquiry into the major
4587200	4595680	light craft. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just saying, generally, just looking at how
4595680	4601040	Harvard treats their staff is they're a little bit more open to Avi having this discussion
4601040	4607680	versus how they were with Mack decades ago. This is my take. Yeah, I think very highly of Avi.
4608720	4612800	Remember when James Clapper lied about mass surveillance to the Congress and nothing happened?
4612800	4616640	Yes. It seems like that's talked about quite a lot. They lie about a bunch of stuff.
4618240	4626240	Okay. Sorry, guys. Just looking for some questions. The chat here is always excellent.
4626640	4628720	That's why I'm trying to look specifically for questions.
4628720	4629680	Yeah, they're awesome.
4630960	4637840	Just because there's a lot of good discussion. Carl Nell and Admiral Wilson. Yeah, that's another.
4637840	4642000	Oh, what do I think of the work Jesse Michaels is doing? I think Jesse is fantastic and he's one
4642000	4648560	of the best voices in the space. I've got to grow to be friends with him over the last couple of
4648560	4654240	months and, of course, hang out with him in person. Jesse is wonderful and he is really,
4654640	4661280	really driven to make change in this field. He is a very solid person. Jesse's just got his
4661280	4664640	own style too, man. We talked about this earlier, but nobody else could show up to the hearings
4664640	4670880	in just like a more laxed fit. If anybody did it, but Jesse, they would look a bit strange.
4671760	4675680	I think we're towards the end now. Keep submitting those questions. Otherwise,
4675680	4680480	we'll just keep chatting about the Immaculate Constellation Report, which we'll get into.
4680560	4686000	You'd go with the DOE people too and former CA, Office of Global Access. Yeah, Gaffney would be
4686000	4689920	good. However, I think the names from Wilson Davis, the senior review group, and specifically would
4689920	4696240	be very good. I would subpoena the sec depths from the 90s. I think Terry was one of them that was
4696240	4702240	talked about who might have had purview because I think he was undersecretary of research and
4702240	4707120	development for DODs, so he would have probably had purview in the early 90s, late 80s.
4707120	4710880	So we're at a little bit of a good point in the questions now. You want to talk a little bit about
4710880	4721120	the Immaculate Constellation Report? Absolutely. There's one report that you have been mulling
4721120	4725920	over in your head a lot. Can you tell us about that case? Absolutely. There's the iPad. We got it
4725920	4731520	up right there. So for those of you guys following at home, we're talking about specifically the
4731520	4737040	cases in Section 2, the US government imagery intelligence. Let me pull up a second screen.
4737040	4741920	How about that? Okay. And while we do that, I can have it right here. Okay, we got Max Farr.
4741920	4745840	Thank you, Max. Max Farr is a good friend of both of us. How's it going, sir? Yeah,
4745840	4750560	now that we have ARBs mentioned in Immaculate Constellation, the time is nigh. I got to say I
4750560	4756720	am thrilled that the term ARB is fully in the report. I think that's excellent.
4757040	4765680	Yeah, just quickly read it. So something that, you know, just reading all these different reports
4765680	4770080	and the examples of just the imagery intelligence that's included within the database of Immaculate
4770080	4775120	Constellation, I'll say a lot of these reports are very interesting and eye-opening, but there's
4775120	4780960	one that I'm very interested to see if we can get either a FOIA request or like any sort of follow-up
4780960	4784400	on this because this would seem like a crazy video. Okay, let me just read the description.
4785280	4791040	On U.S. government networks, there exists OPIR footage of a large saucer-shaped UAP emerging
4791040	4796720	from within a dense cloud formation. The saucer registered black-hot against white-cold with
4796720	4802960	atmospheric disturbances caused by the saucer-shaped UAP visible. The saucer was between 200 to 400
4802960	4808000	meters in circumference and displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface, so I think like
4808000	4814640	a dome on top. After breaking above the cloud cover, the saucer-shaped UAP suddenly reverses its
4814640	4819760	direction, descending partially back into the cloud cover, then accelerating rapidly out of frame
4819760	4825200	and partially obscured by the cloud tops. This behavior was evasive in nature and implied that
4825200	4830960	the saucer-shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space-based collection
4830960	4836160	platform. Now, when I read that, I'm like, it's just like, I'm picturing this and, you know,
4836160	4841440	I'm kind of thinking about the movie NOPE, which was by Jordan Peele. Jordan Peele, and it's a,
4841440	4845520	you know, horror movie with like an alien vehicle that's like living and it eats people whatever.
4845520	4850000	But the common theme of that movie is like, you know, it's in a cloud. It's this white vehicle
4850000	4855840	that's like in this cloud. And as I'm like picturing it, I can almost see it as just this
4855840	4861120	giant saucer. It's like coming in and out of the clouds. And it's, you know, as we also talk about,
4861120	4867680	you know, reporting and trying to identify UAP, it seems that these things are either manipulating
4867680	4873040	or, you know, changing their kind of imagery or like how they present themselves so that
4873040	4877600	we're not aware of them or they're just trying to conceal their nature. So like this disc flying
4877600	4882560	like in the clouds because it doesn't want to be seen by a satellite, like that's kind of crazy.
4882560	4888240	That's kind of crazy. And then further, like what is the, I guess, what is the, what's the video
4888240	4891760	here? Is this like a video from the ground, from a helicopter? Yeah, from ground or a satellite
4891760	4896480	imagery. I don't know. But I think that that would be a very interesting video to get out in the
4896480	4904160	public. Now, can you tell us about the Indo-Pacific mention where ARV is mentioned, please? Yes,
4904160	4910320	yes, yes. So talking about foreign reproduction vehicles, on U.S. government networks, there
4910320	4915040	exists infrared footage of an imagery of a grouping of vessels engaged in SIGINT,
4915040	4919360	Signals Intelligence, and MASSINT, which is Measurement and Measurement Intelligence.
4919360	4924800	I believe so. Keep reading that. I know we looked this up. SIGINT and MASSINT collection at night
4924800	4929920	in a specific area of the Pacific Ocean, not naming names. In this footage, which was in
4929920	4936640	close proximity to the vessels, a large equilateral triangle UAP suddenly appears directly over the
4936640	4943120	ships. The three bright points are seen at each bottom corner of the UAP, which is observed to
4943120	4948480	slowly rotate on its horizontal axis. This rotation partially revealed a horizontal bar of
4948480	4953680	sweeping lights. Intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral
4953680	4958640	triangle is a reproduction vehicle and concludes that the vessels must have been made aware of
4958640	4963680	the ARV's frequent use of these coordinates due to foreign pre-positioning of advanced
4963680	4968800	collection assets at the exact time and place. After a brief period of hovering and slowly
4968800	4975440	rotating approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean, the ARV suddenly disappears and the
4975440	4984160	footage ends. Just ominous. Again, we've heard from individuals, Elizondo whistleblowers,
4984160	4990560	that there are videos and images that exist on U.S. government networks, but a lot of these
4990560	4997920	videos, especially in this case, this was taken in what we would call a denied area. This is a
4997920	5002320	intelligence surveillance platform that we have in a foreign area that we're using to collect
5002320	5009040	intelligence on our foreign adversaries and others. Releasing that publicly would be a little bit
5010080	5016720	little bit controversial. First, we have the equilateral triangle UAP, but then also potentially
5016720	5023680	we might be doxing another country's legacy program. This would be China in this instance,
5023680	5028880	based on the relative proximity, which this is one of the greatest questions. China and Russia
5029760	5036000	are our adversaries as discussed by some people like David Grush. How much success have they
5036000	5040960	made in their legacy programs? Grush has said we're in a decades-long Cold War with our adversaries.
5042640	5050240	Did they rip off a TRF 3B triangle? It's really, really interesting. I find it interesting that
5050800	5056080	the term ARB slash RV is used too. It's not just Alien Reproduction Vehicle, but also
5056080	5060560	Reproduction Vehicle. I'm happy that distinction was made because Reproduction Vehicle could just
5060560	5067120	mean a reverse engineer to make jet or something. Forgive me for speculating here on the live stream,
5067120	5072720	but what if Alien Reproduction Vehicle and Reproduction Vehicle kind of leaves out the
5072720	5078000	possibility that we have Reproduction Vehicles that we wouldn't necessarily call Alien. In the
5078000	5083600	sense of there's potentially objects that are coming extraterrestrially, which we would consider
5084320	5090080	general or traditional aliens. Or is there stuff that's coming interdimensional or within our oceans
5090080	5096320	or some coming in and out of our existence? We could call that Alien or we could call it something
5096320	5100400	else. But at the end of the day, what we're trying to copy, it's a reproduction vehicle.
5101200	5109280	I thought this instance was interesting as well due to just one sentence. So,
5109280	5116160	Southcom tic-tac detected by space asset in proximity a vessel. On USG networks, there exists
5116160	5122240	OPIR imagery of massent of a tic-tac UAP transmitting through an area of the Atlantic Ocean.
5122240	5127760	The tic-tac maneuvers had an altitude at or near local cloud coverage and correlated electromagnetic
5127760	5132640	signatures were collected by massent. In the available footage, the tic-tac UAP transits
5132640	5138880	rapidly through the field of regard as it transits the ocean. No observation reaction is seen to come
5138880	5144240	from the vessel, but its proximity in space and in time and space to the trajectory of this UAP
5144240	5150320	suggests foreknowledge of the UAP event by intelligence. So, what's interesting to me
5150320	5155840	that there is so Magnetic Constellation is just kind of accessing these intelligence databases to
5156560	5161520	collect records and so forth. So, who is the intelligence organization behind shooting this
5161520	5167040	video if they had forewarned knowledge of this UAP incursion event and thus were kind of predicting
5167040	5172240	its movements? Would this be a satellite system? I don't think it's too far of a stretch to think
5172240	5177520	some of these sightings may be conducted by NRO and NGA, gruscious positions who have
5177520	5181520	satellite systems that actually can detect and track some of these vehicles. Yeah, and just knowing
5181840	5186960	how just, I mean, I've never worked in government or military intelligence, but just briefly how
5186960	5191680	that kind of works is, I think that they're trying to get multiple signatures of the same
5191680	5197600	object. It's one thing just to get a satellite, but then also like ground sensor, camera, underwater
5197600	5204640	sensor, a second kind of corroborative source to verify if this thing is existing, it's real.
5204640	5208960	They're tracking it usually on more than one kind of instrument. And let's talk a little bit about
5208960	5216000	the morphologies, right? So, we're using a data set from 1991 to 2002. I'd just like to talk about
5216000	5222640	the morphologies just because it's so interesting. Within the irregular shapes, of course, the jelly
5222640	5227840	fish are floating brains with appendages. Where we see that one is mentioned. Yeah, exactly. And
5227840	5233840	there's also another mention in the report about, I think it's the Mexican border of a jellyfish,
5233840	5239120	which I'll talk about too, but sphere or orb. So, of course, Aero had reported on this as well,
5239120	5243840	including some old data and blue book and so forth. Spheres were the most reported shape with
5243840	5249600	variations ranging from smooth, featureless orbs to spheres with visible openings or appendages.
5250160	5255600	These objects prevalence suggests a possible standard in UAP design or function capable of
5255600	5260640	high maneuverability and speed. The diversity within the sphere category spanning from simple
5260640	5266240	polished appearances to more complex structures with appendages suggests a broad range of purposes
5266240	5271440	or technologies unique to the platform's mission and or the originator. The mention of appendages
5271440	5277280	on spheres instead of a ubiquitous smooth shape reminds me of the 2010 San Diego Sphere Siding.
5277280	5282320	Have you heard of that? I don't think so now. It's a long video. It's about a 12 minute video of a
5282320	5289280	sphere that has what you would describe as almost an antenna around the circumference. And so that
5289280	5295440	is one really interesting sighting. Disk or saucer. Saucer shaped UAPs reported with and
5295440	5300160	without domes. If you want to look that up, go to the It's Redacted YouTube channel. This was posted
5300160	5304720	a couple years ago and maybe we can hold an image up to the screen. They have the full video. Saucer
5304720	5310240	shaped UAPs reported with and without domes were the second most common shape reported. Flat saucers
5310240	5316160	were reported as well. These being disks like objects without pronounced domes. Trilateral
5316240	5322800	biconvex UAPs are also reported in the data. So I think in the Aero Historical Reporting Trends in
5322800	5328400	2022, the saucer shapes were not featured as one of the most common sightings. So I could be wrong
5328400	5332160	there, but that is a, did you see it? No, I was just making a quick note for myself. Okay, let me
5332160	5336400	pull it. I can pull it up. I'll pull it up. You, why don't you read us about oval and tic-tac and
5336400	5340880	bring up some interesting stuff there, especially because I didn't Kirk Patrick imply that the
5340880	5346240	tic-tac may have been human technology? Did Kirk Patrick say that? I don't know, maybe.
5348160	5354080	Oval or tic-tac oval shaped UAPs were infrequently reported within the data set and only after
5354080	5360400	approximately 2003, these UAPs either maintained a uniform egg-like symmetry occasionally tampered
5360400	5366160	into a teardrop shape. So cylinders with convex ends, tic-tacs fall into this category and
5366240	5371680	occasionally feature visible, visible protuberances on the top or bottom of the otherwise uniform
5371680	5377360	plan. So that'd be like the flavor incident, right? With the almost kind of features on the
5377360	5384080	bottom of the craft. So let me pull this up because this is a really, I think, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
5384080	5388080	yeah, I've seen that photo. So this is what I think of when I hear spear and some of the appendages.
5388080	5392640	You guys may have, sorry, you may have heard of the sighting that's 2000. I can't remember the
5392640	5399520	year San Diego Sphere. The YouTube channel is long been defunct, but it's fantastic. It's redacted,
5399520	5405280	has a video on the entire, entire sighting. Will you read off the triangle description?
5405280	5408720	Oh, absolutely. Interesting point I want to touch on there.
5408720	5413680	So triangles were among the rarest UAPs reported in the data. Most of these sightings were
5413680	5419840	equilateral triangles occasionally with vertical stabilizers visible on the top of the UAP.
5419920	5425520	Along gated isosceles types were also reported, were also reported occasionally with the same
5425520	5431440	vertical stabilizers observed on the equilateral type. So the vertical stabilizers is an interesting
5431440	5436720	point. Conventional triangle designs such as the, you know, what you would call the TR3B does not
5436720	5442000	feature this. If you look at some other simple, some other similar designs like the alleged TR3A
5442000	5447200	Astra or so forth, or even that video Tom DeLonge likes to champion, it's that green
5447760	5452560	UFO video at night. One thing I noticed about that triangle is it has stabilizers on top. So
5452560	5456560	I've always tried to reference that because that sort of looks similar to like the X43 unmanned
5456560	5462000	NASA craft and so forth. So that's a, that's a pretty darn interesting. Yeah. All right.
5462000	5465920	What are you looking at now in the report? Sorry, we're kind of bouncing back and forth
5465920	5469200	between the report, but you know, I thought it, I thought it was important for all of us to talk
5469200	5472640	about it and anything that stood out to you guys just leave in the comments. Any questions,
5472640	5478080	especially just let us know about the question. Yeah, I will say just like looking at these
5478080	5483200	different types and just kind of thinking about, you know, the different reports that's kind of
5483200	5488160	being summarized in here, right? Like spheres are, you know, the most common, but they're also kind
5488160	5493360	of the smallest. And then triangles are the rarest, but they can be anywhere from an F16 to a
5493360	5498400	size of a football field. Doesn't it say 600 feet as well? Or no, 600 feet is from other
5499040	5504640	avenues of research. Never mind. Believes. Yeah. Like football field size. Yeah. Football field
5504640	5511680	and 300 feet. So up to two football feats in length. I think the distinction between equilateral
5511680	5518320	and isosceles triangle is important as well. As far as all research I've done into human made
5518320	5524480	triangles, most of them seem equilaterally shaped. There's only a handful of cases dating back to
5524480	5532240	the late 80s, early 90s and early 2000s of isosceles kind of shape triangles. Well, we also have
5532240	5536800	not just triangles, but we also have boomerang arrowhead. Think of the Phoenix lights or think
5536800	5541920	of the testimony of the man who testified at Stephen Greer's NPC, Stephen Digna, who talked
5541920	5547360	about being at a bombing range. And before he left the service due to his health and
5547360	5553200	Raytheon contractors basically facilitating a bomb, a boomerang shaped craft that was projecting
5553840	5558320	something that came onto the range. That's an interesting testimony I'd like to revisit.
5558320	5563360	Yeah. And then also just a lot of the atmospheric or kind of unique emissions and
5563360	5569120	behavior seen by a lot of these as we see loss of time, visual disturbances, feelings of unease
5569120	5576480	or anxiety, electronic device malfunction. And I think Kevin Knuth at Seoul last year gave the
5576480	5582480	best examples of electromagnetic distortion and magnetic distortion. I highly recommend checking
5582480	5589360	that out. I did watch that. That was really good. Very good. What about the organic shapes?
5589360	5594720	Because I think that is probably one of the most interesting things for many people. Yep.
5594720	5599360	Irregularly shaped UAPs, those that devise simple geometric description were among the
5599360	5604160	rarest reported sightings. Shapeshifting UAPs also appear in the dataset, typically having
5604160	5609760	a spherical or disc-like base form from which irregular geometries are seen to project.
5609760	5614720	Floating brain or jellyfish UAPs are present as well, characterized by a central mass from
5614720	5620480	which multiple arms or spars hang downward. Finally, combined shapes were also observed,
5620480	5627040	including cubes within spheres, ringed saucers, and various rectangular and cuboid forms.
5627040	5630880	The cuboid form, of course, that's interesting, calling back to Ryan Graves.
5630880	5634000	Cube within a sphere is also one of those sightings as well.
5634000	5639600	Specific mention of brain is very interesting to me specifically. The two don't really correlate,
5639600	5644560	but I often think back to the physics concept of Boltzmann brain. The idea behind a Boltzmann
5644560	5648720	brain from physicists can't remember his name Boltzmann, but it'd be far more efficient rather
5648720	5655040	than an existing universe with matter for just a basically a combination of electric
5655040	5659680	charged particles forming a brain, drifting through space, thinking of the material universe.
5659760	5665440	I just think of that for the brain shape. Yeah, and something else just to point out
5665440	5670480	that might be interesting is in terms of unique emissions, what we see with these irregular
5670480	5674800	organics is that we see a temperature drop associated with these, and we don't really see
5674800	5680400	that reported with the other morphologies, which is interesting. I'd be interested if there's
5680400	5685920	any transmedial sighting or footage of these organic shapes, if there's also a temperature drop
5686480	5693280	and temperature gradient as it may enter C or other domain, for variable temperatures.
5693280	5696480	That'd be kind of interesting to see the heat signature and how it alters over the course
5696480	5702000	of its flight. If perhaps when it moves faster, it heats up and so forth. Of course, we're not
5702000	5708640	privy to any of this information, but we got our public report on our hands. Well, I think someone
5708640	5714160	in the chat mentioned earlier, Oak Shannon. I think this is a very, very interesting kind of
5714160	5719520	little tidbit in this document here. For section five, restricted US government historical records,
5719520	5724400	there is a call out to a specific, it's a serial number that corresponds to an official NSA report
5724400	5731760	published in 1978, which people have now confirmed was included, this specific citation was included
5731760	5735840	in Oak Shannon's notes, which is very interesting. The specific notes, I'm trying to remember the
5735840	5741280	actual event I've referenced it a few times. The specific event, it may have been at Los Alamos
5741280	5746400	National Labs where Oak Shannon took notes from some detailed speakers. I referenced here when
5746400	5753440	Oak Shannon relayed information he was told about an undersea base, a USO base. So he writes about
5753440	5760000	that. He writes about connection to possible MHD propulsion physics with, I think, a 3.5 gigahertz
5760000	5765360	range. Numerous interesting notes about programs. I think he mentions Bobby Ray Inman in that.
5765360	5770320	That's just off the top of my head, but these notes are for a panel of speakers that I think was at
5770400	5775040	Los Alamos in the late 80s. Yep. And then just to add about this report as well. The substance of
5775040	5779840	the report concerns scientific research in the Soviet Union on the topics of parapsychology,
5779840	5785040	Psi, and biological effects on UAPs on human beings. Additionally, the existence of this
5785040	5789760	reporting stream demonstrates that US intelligence was explicitly tasked to collect on foreign entities
5789760	5795200	active in areas often relegated to the fringes of scientific research, including parapsychology,
5795200	5799440	and the biological effects of encounters with UAP. And this shouldn't be surprising, guys,
5799440	5803600	even people who are uncomfortable with the idea of Psi like myself, it's pretty new to them.
5803600	5810320	Let's think back to the NSWC crane project in which not only SAIC, but the Project Stargate,
5810320	5815520	which was researching the Psi phenomena from SRI and the CIA. But even in 2011 and onward,
5815520	5821440	the O&R, the Office of Naval Research, published papers on human sixth sense and human psionic
5821440	5827440	abilities, which is still extremely strange. This is why we need good smart guys like Max,
5827440	5833040	who are really well researched into some of this this Psi connection. Absolutely.
5833040	5836960	So let's go. I think we got some questions. We'll look through the chat with it. We'll look through
5836960	5842160	here. So have you or anyone you know made any inroads to getting information around the energy
5842160	5848800	source of these vehicles? Has anyone talked about plasma? Yes. I think Edgar Fouchet in the TR3B
5848800	5855040	discusses superheated plasma along with mercury. Inroads, as far as the energy source, there's
5855040	5858960	disagreements. I know really smart people who think that we haven't quite cracked zero point
5858960	5864400	systems. I think to the story of Brad Sorensen, where zero point systems are applicable. I've
5864400	5871040	heard from numerous people that electrogravity are a thing. Could you mind passing me a soda?
5871040	5876160	Yeah, I got you. I think electrogravity are possibly a thing too. Of course, there's the story
5876160	5887120	of MFD, MHD. So there's quite a bit of information around energy systems. Nothing concrete yet.
5887840	5892880	I don't know if you have heard anything else. Sorry, I was just kind of going off topic there.
5894160	5898000	Do you guys believe Grush will ever be allowed on a skiff? They've now had nearly 18 months to
5898000	5903840	hide everything. That is a good point, right? If locations are violated, then there's not
5903920	5910240	immediate actionable intelligence follow-ups that these locations will likely be cleared or
5910240	5917520	further obfuscations created. If I remember, Grush did not get in a skiff with Verchette?
5918400	5924160	I don't think he got in a skiff with them at all. Okay, yeah. I know that Burleson has at least
5924160	5932800	been privy to the op-ed by Grush. I have these conversations occurred outside of Skiff, I'm
5932800	5942160	not sure, but to me, it's pretty unacceptable. Okay, yeah. We talked about this a little bit,
5942160	5946640	but do you think Boebert's comments were purposeful in order to harm public perception on this topic?
5947200	5952560	Judi, by the way, she talked. I just think she probably carries a bit of the stigma, because
5952560	5956080	I'd like to mention, guys, before the hearings even started, the cameraman,
5956880	5960080	when people were filing in and looked at me and said, oh, this is going to go on Ancient Aliens,
5960080	5965760	right? What am I going to say to that? No, this is a serious congressional hearing. Right outside,
5965760	5969520	I had to run out, use the restroom before we started. I hear a bunch of staffers or congressmen
5969520	5974160	talking, this is what happens when you leave YouTube autoplay on for too long. If you're finding
5974160	5978240	my channel off autoplay, first of all, thanks for being here. But second of all, I mean, that's
5979600	5984960	so foolish. And that's the sort of mind and stigma that has been manufactured. And it's
5984960	5988800	understandable if you have felt that and experienced that, because that is very well
5988800	5994560	orchestrated by the CIA all the way back since 52. But many people fall victim to this.
5994560	5998720	Yeah. I mean, it's one thing just to make jokes and just being coy about it and just being like,
5998720	6003520	oh, yeah, Ancient Aliens, whatever. It's funny to joke about. But I did notice that there were
6004160	6011360	quite a few people that they talk about it as if this is... There isn't really anything there
6011360	6016640	there. And it's still kind of a conspiracy. And who are these people and what are these programs?
6017600	6023760	She treats it the same as maybe like chemtrails or other popular conspiracies like birds.
6023760	6028720	But also from her perspective, she's kind of been like one of the conspiracy theorists in
6028720	6035040	Congress. That's kind of her reputation, if you will. So, hey, I mean, roll with what you know.
6035040	6040160	But I don't think her comments were super helpful or really appreciated by people
6040160	6044000	in the UFO world that wanted sober conversation about this.
6044000	6046720	And I think a lot of the people that are going to affect change when we have
6047600	6051680	Congress people like this are going to be their staffers. There's a world of staffers that take
6051680	6056400	this very seriously who want to learn. And they want to affect change and they want to have the
6056400	6062400	information to brief. Not brief, that might be a poor word, but to inform the person they work
6062400	6067040	for and so forth. So, Magic says, have you seen Sheehan making the rounds lately? What are your
6067040	6070480	thoughts on everything he is saying? Seems worlds apart from just getting into the public site,
6070480	6076400	guys. Well, we had lunch yesterday right by Sheehan in this crazy, crazy gray hair. And
6076400	6080000	he also had like a disclosure event outside of the park right after.
6080000	6084800	There was a rally outside like a block away from the Rayburn building where the hearing happened.
6084800	6090640	And he spoke and then a couple other individuals spoke as well. Yeah.
6090640	6097440	I think for the amount of information Sheehan puts out, he needs to start supplying adequate
6097440	6104080	research, go along it, alongside of it or evidence or other people to confirm these statements.
6104800	6108720	Danny Sheehan, of course, has been very consequential as a really interesting person,
6108720	6114160	but before he continues to put forward new information, he kind of needs to figure out
6114160	6122560	ways to back up his things he said previously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what I will say about that
6122560	6127440	with Sheehan is I think he's not a stranger to kind of fighting the government as well.
6127440	6133680	And I think part of it is he has kind of a role to play as kind of the legal person that's helping
6133680	6138640	facilitate stuff behind the scenes with certain players. But also as we see kind of with this
6138640	6145040	new Paradigm Institute, I think, you know, there's kind of a public perception or kind of awareness
6145040	6149120	intention there of just trying to get that organization set up. So I think that's kind
6149120	6153520	of why we're seeing this like interesting stuff with Sheehan, because traditionally, you know,
6153520	6157600	he's like, he's a lawyer, he's an attorney, he's kind of working on the investigative space,
6157600	6160720	but then also seeing him with like the new Paradigm Institute and that stuff as well,
6160720	6165600	it's like, okay, how do you reconcile that? Selling degrees. Yeah. Yeah. For tens of thousands of
6165600	6170400	dollars. Jimmy says, I have friends who believe it's almost definitely Chinese or Russian tech,
6170400	6174880	especially Chinese. What, if any, gives you the confirmation this is fact alien slash
6174880	6179920	NHI? Well, I think quite a few factors. One of them is the persistent existence of this phenomenon
6179920	6185680	for more than 80 years. In fact, you can even go into other stories in history, but even dating
6185680	6189760	back to the Magenta Crash in 1933, there are similarities in this phenomenon in terms of
6189760	6194480	crash shape, in terms of performance characteristics of craft. I mean, you had Nazi scientists,
6194480	6199200	Herman Oberth, studying flying saucer flight dynamics, estimating tens if not hundreds of
6199200	6203200	thousands miles per hour, these things would be flown. You can also look at the G-forces
6203200	6208160	experienced by some of these craft. It's not a ballistic missile that can handle 120 Gs. It's
6208160	6214160	not a human being that can sustain nine Gs before seeing permanent injury. I know Lou talked about
6214160	6219760	this during the hearing or was it UAPBF? We talked about G-forces experienced by the craft. Was that
6219760	6223200	the hearing? That was at the hearing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So Lou kind of lobald that a little bit.
6223200	6227440	If you look at the work by Kevin Knuth and estimating flight characteristics of unidentified
6227440	6231840	aerial phenomenon, which is a great paper, I highly recommend everybody read this.
6232800	6237120	It analyzes the performance characteristics of not just the 2004 Nimitz, but also the 1986
6237120	6242240	Japan Airlines case and other such cases. G-forces of this, these craft can be experienced
6242240	6250960	of up to 5,000 Gs. That's very different. There's also numerous reports from under fast walkers that
6251520	6256960	NORAD and NASA and the DSP defense support program would call these craft back in the 60s, 70s,
6256960	6261280	and 80s that had a term for craft that were entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere.
6261360	6268640	These would not show classical characteristics of fuel burning rockets and traditional
6268640	6273440	prosaic technologies. These things would sometimes arrive from deep space or return to deep space.
6274080	6278480	I don't know, especially in the 60s and 70s of Chinese tech, that's playing into do that.
6278480	6283520	Yeah. Again, we're also talking about sightings that have been seen even before
6284080	6288960	modern weapons as well. How far do we really want to go with this?
6289120	6297040	I would say there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there was a phenomenon that existed well
6297040	6304560	before the Second World War and the creation of the world superpowers, all that stuff. You can try
6304560	6309520	to figure out whether or not that's alien non-human. I personally think that that seems to be the
6309520	6313680	conclusion just based off of those historical reports. I know there's a lot of researchers
6313680	6319040	that look at that pre-modern history of UFO sightings. Which is very valid.
6321040	6327840	I think your friend is right about the idea that some of these craft might be ARB of Chinese or
6327840	6335440	Russian origin. Just like many of the ARB are of United States origin. Some of our allies possibly
6335440	6340640	also have their own technology as well. I just think that many of the craft, especially when
6340640	6345120	you start looking at craft characteristics and differences in reported craft that are considered
6345120	6351200	ARB versus non-human craft, just the difference in the craft makeup. Non-human craft often described
6351200	6356720	as perfect, rivetless, seamless, no visible means of propulsion, somehow able to create,
6356720	6360480	go faster than the speed of sound and decelerate quickly without any sonic booms,
6360480	6365600	without with very minimal or no electromagnetic signatures or signatures of any kind.
6366560	6372240	The performance characteristics of these craft are not prosaic even to when people say oh well
6372240	6376960	you know military is 20 years ahead, there's you know ballistic missiles 20 years from now
6376960	6381120	are not surviving 5,000 geese of force dropping from 15,000 feet to sea level in less than two
6381120	6389440	seconds. Okay got anything about my question on getting remote viewing under mainstream
6389440	6394640	science scrutiny? Are there any efforts there from me? Yes, yes, yes, I see. Yes, and talking to
6394640	6400560	Chris from Area 52, I would really like to maybe see if we can put on some public displays
6400560	6405840	of remote viewing to maybe you know introduce the the channel to whether the efficacy or
6407440	6412320	or not not if there's nothing there. I would absolutely like to do that because this would
6412320	6416720	be something we'd all be learning together. Well they had a lot of those studies in the late 80s
6416720	6421520	and 90s and at least according to the government there was no there wasn't really a basis to
6421520	6427200	continue funding of it but then ultimately that whole program got transferred over to SAIC in 1995.
6427200	6432320	So do you believe the blue book classified version of his story where he says he saw the images this
6432320	6438800	is um this is Danny Sheehan. Yes after yeah I would say after like I think there's been some
6438800	6443600	records that have come out of the era like out of this like whole declassification process and
6443600	6449120	particularly the Air Force Blue Book documents. The symbols that he that Sheehan has like drawn out
6449120	6454400	or whatever um like. This was put in NARA recently right the National Archives. Yep yep so like he
6454400	6458560	like the depiction I think the depiction that he gave of those symbols is like dead accurate
6458560	6462800	of the symbols that are in these blue book files. Yeah I'd also like to reference it is a fact that
6462800	6468640	there were programs working alongside blue book that were not unacknowledged but not referenced
6468640	6472880	this would be project Stork out of Patel and then you can also adhere to the testimony of other
6472880	6478560	whistleblowers such as Steven Lufkin who said that he was privy to a program more classified
6478560	6482720	than blue book a more classified blue book basically where he was shown some of the Roswell
6482720	6489520	degree and so yes I think that is a really good really good question. Question how do you guys
6489520	6493200	picture disclosure personally I think Richette's whistleblower type protections won't pass but
6493200	6499360	if it does I think there has to be someone walking out of Lockheed etc. If there are pension protections
6499360	6505520	I think that could be possible that's what I have to say. Yep I think that specific language of it
6505520	6510560	is they're going to give whistleblower protections to any whistleblower that has knowledge of
6510560	6515600	basically taxpayer funds that are being used so I think the first inquiry right is like government
6515600	6519600	funds taxpayer money that's being spent on this and I think that that's good I hope that those
6519600	6525120	protections pass um but then I think the second part right and this is it goes back to kind of
6525120	6529280	the theory of like how does this get funded well if the government's not writing a black check to
6529280	6533600	Lockheed Martin are they taking money from investors potentially and then like how aware of those
6533600	6537600	investors in those types of programs and that's a question that's really kind of the messier
6537600	6541120	legal questions that open up from that questions like that you have been talking about and thinking
6541120	6545200	about quite a bit the last couple of days I've talked with a lot of people about it it's very
6545200	6551520	interesting okay Eric says uh any comments on how put off you brought Lew into the program and many
6551520	6555840	others he met with H teller and worked on graph control best candidate for involvement in legacy
6555840	6561600	program I am oh I am really eagerly awaiting his appearance in the program he needs to get subpoena
6561600	6566560	yeah he needs to get subpoena too but I think he'd be uh I think he'd be a agreeable witness
6566560	6570880	because there's hostile witnesses there's non agreeable witnesses and there's agreeable witnesses
6570880	6577760	he should be encouraged to attend the hearing and a closed yeah senate section okay lou said this
6577760	6585280	okay you're talking about lou in the cold war same as grush um do you believe that UAP are alive
6585280	6588960	as Luna said a theory I've seen in the genre for a while well as we talked about in the
6588960	6595200	immaculate constellation report the idea of biological crap would then um would then kind
6595200	6599360	of encourage that I think it's quite possible you know we talk about this all the time I don't
6599360	6604960	think UAP and non-human intelligence is mutually exclusive or is is really siloed if there's one
6604960	6609120	non-human intelligence here it opens the door for numerous types of non-human intelligence
6609120	6614880	all with different capabilities and um basically propulsion systems and methods of travel and
6614880	6621200	methods of communication and methods of detailing their presence are all quite possible yeah I will
6621200	6627440	say the movie nope Jordan Peele great movie scary but I can definitely see that happening
6627440	6635120	after the specific mention of brain in the uh IC report it's it's very very very startling to me
6635840	6641520	okay oh okay this is a good one for us max can you speculate on the origin of the sphere that
6641600	6648320	was located underneath NSWC for anybody that doesn't know um the program Kermit and I worked on
6648320	6654960	together was um the off-world technologies division yep experienced by Green Beret 18 Bravo weapon
6654960	6662000	sergeant RA uh witness RA who in the early 2010s was sent to RA for an advanced weapons trading
6662000	6667680	course and here he and one other person because of their high clearance levels and because of
6667680	6672720	some of their accomplishments level five of sphere um you know deployments and so forth were
6673280	6677840	basically taken underground by a contractor seen some interesting Russian ballistics and
6677840	6682000	some interesting weaponry as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant you have to do proficient with all
6682000	6688880	forms of small arms fire and then they're brought into a place deep underground um the air was
6688880	6696640	described as very damp stale cold by RA into an off-world technologies division here the contractor
6696720	6703920	who we both highly suspect as SAIC show two pieces of technology one and almost tablet device that
6703920	6708960	seemed to be projecting writing uh RA did not know if this was in his head or actually physically
6708960	6715040	like a holographic projection of writing and this piece was said to have been recovered uh during
6716240	6721840	being recovered and was considered a weapon due to an electric or an energetic discharge during
6721840	6727120	recovery the other piece was a sphere about the size of a baseball with a small indent at the top
6728400	6733200	this was described as metallic but very smooth and almost shimmering like oil on water
6734560	6740560	RA was told that this specific piece of technology somehow interacted with consciousness as far as
6740560	6746960	the origins of this I've talked to max the person asking the question and Kermit here about another
6746960	6752240	individual Navy connect Navy connected who likely interacted with the same technology a couple
6752240	6762080	decades prior so if that's the case the Navy might have had an active program uh with this piece for
6762080	6768960	weird kind of the size stuff we were talking about the origins if it's housed alongside that gauntlet
6768960	6773600	tablet type thing that is considered weapons technology one has to assume that this was also
6773600	6778480	a piece of technology recovered from a crash retrieval absolutely and I also think just the
6778480	6782240	nature of the crash retrievals themselves and we kind of see this in other reports here and there is
6783360	6788320	as these things are taken in right as we're retrieving these craft were then trying to
6788320	6792640	you know piece off these different areas of like okay Lockheed figure out how the craft work SAIC
6792640	6796400	figure out how this orb works right north figure out how this engine works right and just trying
6796400	6801440	to piece these different areas and giving these technologies transferred over to private industry
6801440	6808960	to try to see if they can figure out how this shit works you know I at least don't know the origin
6809520	6816240	but I can with confidence say that this was taken off of a crash retrieval where when are there
6816240	6821840	multiple no idea absolutely no idea the witness I've spoken to that encountered this was on the
6821840	6828800	other side of the country the California to be exact so was this program shelved that the
6828800	6833600	Navy used with this and then this is just housed for further analysis and I would like to harken
6833600	6840320	back to Harold Malmgren who spoke about being briefed in the 1960s about an other world technologies
6840320	6846080	division yep very close yep do you guys feel like any of these quote-unquote UFOs can be top secret
6846080	6851920	government weapons absolutely alien reproduction vehicle absolutely absolutely it's just I mean
6852480	6857280	UFO is an unidentified flying object you see like an experimental aircraft you don't know what the
6857280	6861360	hell it is you're going to think it's a UFO right but it could just be something like a you know new
6861360	6866240	drone or you know the new self-claim whatever so yeah what do you say we'll go for 10 more minutes
6866240	6870560	answering questions yeah all right guys we'll keep going for some questions for a few more minutes and
6870560	6875760	then we'll uh okay we answered that about how put off Eric sorry if we're getting to the question
6875760	6881200	slow guys I just think you know I'm glad Kermit feels the same way everyone's taking their time
6881200	6885920	to ask questions so really appreciate it y'all yeah and these are I told you Kermit everybody
6885920	6892560	ask the best questions here okay with the admission that yes USG has a crash retrieval in reverse
6892560	6897120	engineering program for UAP this validates claims of Herrera and Weigand is there a lawsuit in the
6897120	6906000	works reparations I think their cases are you know far more kind of uh I guess Michael's case
6906000	6910640	doesn't relegate to that as much because remember Michael's case talks about seeing an alien
6910640	6916560	reproduction vehicle this specifically octagonal shaped I'm still trying to track down the manufacturer
6916560	6922960	for that Greer thinks it's locky but has proposed no evidence but Weigand his story is one of those
6922960	6928160	more classic crash retrievals and with some of the comments in the IC report about you know
6928160	6933600	psychological effects and then the probability that was a DOE nest team you know you kind of have
6933600	6937520	to analyze that with a more credible with a different lens and you do with Michael now with
6937520	6944960	the testimony of ARV I just am waiting to see a dang report of a octagonal ARV please yeah okay let me
6946480	6949040	okay okay talking about the oak shane and serial numbers
6951280	6955360	what do you think it will take for mainstream scientific analysis to start looking into remote
6955360	6961680	viewing and either confirm or debunk it for good that's a good question I and I have to assume
6962640	6968560	academia approaching UAP and how they approach UAP is likely the same approach they take to
6968560	6972880	promote viewing I cannot think of a reason why the subject should not be studied seriously
6972880	6978320	especially when the Navy studies yeah this might seem like a very random call out but I'm I'm now
6978320	6983840	remembering there's a 60 minutes documentary that happened that looked at basically there's a scientific
6983840	6988800	study that was done where they were trying to prove precognition where individuals were like
6988800	6992640	shown as a set of numbers or something and they basically had to predict what the next number
6992640	6997920	and the sequence was going to be like before they even saw it and what they determined from that
6998480	7004160	is that it seemed that there was some type of correlation between you know we what we call
7004160	7009360	a sixth sense or something that's like you know exists in our mind but there was there was a very
7009360	7014720	real trend where like these individuals could like use this precognitive ability so I feel like
7014720	7019680	stuff like that and just kind of getting those types of reports and just getting the awareness out
7019680	7025360	and then you know trying to come up with ways kind of similar to that study I know it's kind of like
7025360	7030240	weirdly specific and it's just off the dome but I think things like that will kind of help us try to
7030240	7034800	figure that out it's strange to me that kind of the fallback is oh the CIA did a study in the 80s
7034800	7040640	and their Stargate and nothing came from it yeah it's not a reason not to study the subject no
7040720	7045280	okay thoughts on the skinny bob video I think I get to ask this every time I have I have no
7045280	7052080	thoughts about it I I have never once studied it at least from a first glance it looks to be a
7052080	7057440	little a little too smooth for for realness what do you say Kermit but I have not studied it at all
7057440	7066720	yeah I I don't I don't um I don't have an opinion on any videos that claim to depict biologics
7066720	7073440	or non-human intelligence so question and of course like you know if the politics are pertinent
7073440	7077200	to UAP of course we'll talk about it not to be political but don't you worry that people like
7077200	7081360	bobert and trump might lessen the credibility of the top rick half the country doesn't take him
7081360	7086400	seriously that that is something I think we talked about that if trump really pushed disclosure
7086400	7091120	would that kind of be used as a talking point to discredit disclosure because so many people find
7091120	7096640	trump in the kind of poor taste it raises a good question uh bobert as well as we kind of saw with
7096640	7103760	the the hearing um wrong attitude in my opinion yeah I will say I had an interesting conversation
7103760	7108240	with some staffers on the democrat side they kind of brought up the same point too of just like hey
7108240	7113200	you know particularly in the hearing yesterday a lot of the representatives in that were republican
7113200	7117040	and I think as we think about the next four years and trumping president and all those new
7117040	7123600	cabinet positions and whatnot um you know I think we'll we'll start to see some more answers but
7123600	7128640	again I think to your point right when bobert and trump talk about this I think people particularly
7128640	7132240	on the other side kind of see it a certain way and they'll just kind of check out and be like oh
7132240	7137360	trump's a crazy person and this just confirms my own opinion um I do think he could be a good asset
7137360	7141600	it's just it's really coming down to the communication it's tough to navigate now just with so much
7141600	7147360	distrust in any administration really yeah yeah so you know we'll see it it's a great question and
7147360	7152800	if it's yeah go ahead we should talk about trump's uncle because uh that's something that I love to
7152800	7157600	bring up when people get political about this so donald trump's uncle was john trump who was a
7157600	7164160	mit professor who was he worked for the radiation laboratory at lincoln lab and he was like one of
7164160	7170000	the early founders of radar and in 1943 when tesla died john trump was called in by the united states
7170080	7173920	to basically document all of tesla's patents and make sure that none of them were dangerous so
7174560	7178400	I don't want to get too speculative I don't want to say that john trump was part of legacy program
7178400	7182000	but of all the people with all the relevant experience I think his uncle would have been
7182000	7188640	someone that would have known something that's a great point so so what is uh kms what is your
7188640	7192720	opinion on gold's testimony if you consider begging for money a testimony I think it's disappointing
7192720	7198880	he was not asked about material transfer between all sap uh bigelow aerospace and lock emart yeah I
7198880	7205280	agree I it honestly it's like that was that's what I was expecting and ultimately it's like maybe
7205280	7210000	you know maybe gold wasn't really involved with that and maybe you know they had conversations
7210000	7213520	prior and they're like I can't really talk about it because I just don't really know anything but
7213520	7217040	the fact they didn't even ask the question to begin with just like the public can know about that
7217040	7220960	because like we the public were aware of all sap we're aware of bigelow and all this stuff
7220960	7226480	why didn't you ask the question at all yeah that was weird the smell test gold was a really nice
7226480	7232160	well-to-do meaning guy but nasa has been caught lying about UFOs before so then be the most
7232160	7239920	transparent agency he's ever worked for you know I I'd uh I'd have to agree with that so so Juan
7239920	7246000	again thank you sir even the hoc are aware aware carl nel is uh first hand yeah an army futures
7246000	7255440	command and deputy cto of north of bromance that's a guy who should have testified yep yep what uh
7255440	7259520	what do you make of the idea that nh i may be a component of preventing disclosure I wouldn't
7259520	7264400	be surprised but I I don't have too much of a thesis there I do like to think back to David
7264400	7269280	grush talking about agreements with uh with nh i yeah and if there's I mean if there's positive
7269280	7274240	and negative nh i and you know we can't really figure out what they want to do here it wouldn't
7274240	7278480	be hard to assume that there's nh i that don't really agree with yeah right from an outside
7278480	7284160	perspective it's always really difficult for me to attribute uh human motivation to non-human
7284160	7289920	intelligence yeah are we okay are we heading towards what Reagan spoke of or humanity unites
7289920	7295280	to fight an outside force listen I think Reagan put plenty of defenses uh plenty of money into
7295280	7299840	those defenses under the sdi star wars program we had some really good stuff and yeah I think
7299840	7305440	there's a lot of funds that were given to other programs and used for for uap stuff yeah but I
7305440	7309600	think kind of coming back to the threat narrative here I think there's there's been some discussion
7309600	7312960	around that a little bit it just like you know what these things are and how this is going to be
7312960	7317200	presented to the public I know Reagan's comments were really about like you know what happens if
7317200	7321200	an alien threat gets revealed and then like the public you know the world would just unite all
7321200	7326560	around together yeah I don't really feel like this this is going to happen with this situation I
7326560	7331120	think that I think disclosure the way it's playing out is is being done in a way that like ensures
7331120	7336480	like national sovereignty instead of like you know this being like oh shit they're showing up and we
7336480	7341920	have five years to prepare a type thing like something like from a movie um so yeah it it's
7341920	7345920	kind of interesting but I don't I don't think it's going to be like this big international
7345920	7350320	like new world order yeah you know I think really it's just people trying to get to the bottom of
7350320	7356880	it and a lot of people I think use that to push the um star or blue beam blue beam theory oh yeah
7356880	7362720	blue beam okay question from truth sauce the video you did about mark mcandellish was awesome
7362720	7368480	thank you sir any further discussions on uh with the living friend that threatened you
7369120	7374080	yes and he threatened me again and I found other people who he's threatened as well
7374800	7381280	so maybe he needs to be summoned as a hostile witness maybe he needs to be summoned okay
7381280	7386320	awakening to reality what's up man jonathan thank you for joining looking for the uh looking for the
7386320	7391280	cues okay yes match part just talked about this remember all four of technologies is mentioned
7391280	7396320	by herald malmgren in relation to richard the cell I think he specifically said other world
7396320	7404480	technologies but still and he was uh the cell was cia director as well yep yep okay okay so
7405280	7409040	long ago when we got claims that people from greerstein the pentagon and co have been opting
7409040	7412960	funds illegally and estimated two trillion were unaccounted for how can congress get accounts
7412960	7418160	and tell them about you trying to talk to kathryn austin fits yeah so I mean I reached out to kathryn
7418160	7423200	a handful of times uh when I was writing my like recent report on the legal financial framework a
7423200	7427360	lot of the stuff that I kind of pulled and talked about really comes from her salari missing money
7427360	7433440	dot com website uh very I mean just treasure trove of information about financial covert
7433440	7438320	operations and stuff like that highly encourage y'all to check that out if you're interested in that
7438960	7445360	um but now no response from her unfortunately but this estimated two trillion dollars unaccounted
7445360	7452160	for that still exists um because a lot of people are really aware of this but the department of
7452160	7458400	defense is now being required to basically go through full independent audits of itself which
7458400	7465360	it's never really had to do that in its history before up until actually 2017 interesting date um
7465360	7471600	so and what's interesting is just in the past six and seven years of pentagon audits if you look at
7471600	7477680	just the money and just kind of the remediations that they've made it is it is a black hole that is
7477680	7481920	trillions of dollars worth and it's not going away and fits all not gone away fits said it's
7481920	7486960	not just do d but housing and urban development it's a lot of other agencies yep it was she
7486960	7493040	I think from her account she saw cumulative four trillion dollars move from department of defense
7493040	7500640	and department of uh housing and urban hud sorry hud and do d four trillion cumulative in that one
7500640	7504720	year that she was so this is just an interesting thing while we scroll down get to the rest of
7504720	7508800	the questions none of these guys were whistleblowers um yeah I agree with that in the sense that we
7508800	7513920	talked about earlier that uh we're both familiar with accounts where people who are planning to
7513920	7518960	testify have been threatened up to the day of not to and uncertain congressman being a little bit
7518960	7526800	surprised or expecting kind of mercy or more firsthand people to uh to uh go for okay hey
7526800	7531360	here's one especially for you kermit have you guys come across the work of trevor james constable
7531360	7535840	he talked about sky creatures back in 77 and says the movie nope has similarities to his work
7535840	7540640	I personally haven't but I I'd love to kind of check that out now I also found the movie pretty
7540640	7543760	interesting I'm gonna have to put that in my notes so thank you for the reference thank you pun
7543760	7548880	shrink I appreciate I appreciate that a lot for james constable okay sorry we'll look through
7548880	7557520	more questions um hey thank you john s you rock as well sky creatures so cool uh let's see okay
7557840	7564720	okay let's see uh so yeah michael made those kind of claims and I I still don't know if there's
7564720	7573840	any veracity to them um and so forth so weighing boss uh thank you so much for the five bucks why
7573840	7580960	were no ad runs or ads run against uap caucus members deliberately so is the topic that obscure
7580960	7586800	I think the topic is that obscure like is this is this saying like during their like when they
7586800	7592640	were seeking election maybe for uap caucus maybe maybe in the sense of like why are there no
7592640	7598080	inflammatory posts against guys like lester or uh some of the guys really trying to talk to
7598080	7606400	staffers and so forth okay got you um I think it's just obscure yeah I will say like the
7606400	7611280	the congressional hearings were very well attended but I will say you could probably guess who a
7611280	7615520	majority of the people were there just based off of who talks a lot on twitter and reddit
7615520	7622160	but yeah anybody asking about brad brad has given me nothing but yep like yelling at me and all
7622160	7628880	caps are giving me death threats so leslie gain thought it was disturbing but also had a laugh
7628880	7632800	with me about it so if you can divulge who are the most interesting people you connected with
7632800	7638000	at dc it's been a good way to meet movers and shakers the most interesting person not at liberty
7638000	7643440	to kind of uh talk about that but some of the interesting people uh talking with lou talking
7643440	7652080	with gallaudet every second okay I made a list of people I talked to so let me go through okay
7652080	7657440	so lester nair jesse michael's chris from area 52 amar from yes theory tim gallaudet jeremy
7657440	7662240	corbell michael gold lou elezano james foch merrick von reinenkamp timber chet eric burleson
7662240	7666640	nancy mace danie sheehan michael schellenberger missleman jack awesome twitter account matt
7666640	7671360	ford matthew pines leslie cane um and probably a couple more and I got to talk to all these people
7671360	7676800	yeah right the conversations it we had like a 15 hour day yesterday yeah it was like I mean
7676800	7683680	started at 7am and then we got back to the hotel at like 10 we were so pooped we were walking back
7683680	7688400	from the place in which uapdf was held back to our hotel and I think both of us were just kind of
7688400	7694560	having like a a really surreal experience absolutely I mean yesterday was oh probably one of the most
7694560	7702960	consequential days I've ever had and true honor I mean we're just we're just two two guys and
7702960	7709440	we get to uh I'm really proud of the community for kind of stop uh not being so much of a closed
7709440	7714880	door community and I'm seeing a lot of people Democrats Republicans uh smart lawyers like
7714880	7721120	Ivan a lot of these people kind of communicating and talking yeah it's a lot of people working
7721120	7727840	together and it's it's it's very humbling to see it and it's it's very exciting because it's it's a
7727840	7733440	lot of people that have good motivations and they're inquisitive and they just want the truth
7733440	7742720	you know and it's everyone's on the same team um so oh what if we're what if we're a science
7742720	7746800	experiment or perhaps our existence hinges on us not knowing we're an experiment maybe that's why
7746880	7751360	they don't want to disclose that's quite possible I mean there are reports even
7751360	7757920	outside of Bob Lazar of the human genome being tampered with or humans being and I don't want to
7757920	7762560	count in Zachariah's Sitchin and the the Sumerians because I think there's uh some problems with
7762560	7767520	those translations but it's a very valid theory yeah I mean Lude talks about in his book he equates
7767520	7772000	humanity to the 800 pound gorilla in the exhibit right when we steal the tranquilizer gun and then
7772000	7778800	what happens when we uh knock on the zookeeper's door good question Viagra 500 milligrams I get a
7778800	7784080	chance to watch NAPS new documentary we had an awkward episode with Michael um no I I have not
7784080	7789600	seen that yet I that's investigating alien and I will watch it at some point I just I haven't seen
7789600	7796320	anything besides the trailer uh is that what's this new Dan Farah docus that's being overhyped I
7796320	7799920	don't know I don't know the do you know anything about the documentary because I've been asked
7799920	7805120	like multiple times is this person that you talk to in the documentary I'm mostly no what is the
7805120	7810880	documentary yeah I I don't know too much about it I know it's been kind of talked about in tandem
7810880	7818320	with Fox's production the program um to my knowledge this Farah films doc is going to feature
7818320	7827920	like 30 different high level witnesses um 30 30 and the mostly government military I hope so
7827920	7833760	but I find that I find that tough to however I don't think there's been any communications about
7834320	7838240	if that documentary has finished what the state of it is and whether or not it's going to be
7838240	7844560	published I think people I think the rumor was it was supposed to be published before the election
7844560	7849360	and then it was after the election and then like even still it's just it there's no date on the
7849360	7854320	calendar yet for it but it it exists it's real and the people that are in the film uh that we
7854320	7859280	got to shake hands with they talked about it with us they're like yes this is like the Farah film I
7859280	7865360	was in this whatever um and I think I think even um Michael gold even Michael during the hearing is
7865360	7870240	like I'm going to talk about it in this uh this documentary that's coming I'm like okay cool like
7870240	7876480	we need to see that now so who is Dan Farah that's a good question because I like a documentary
7876480	7882640	I have no idea I look this up thoughts on project gravitar the new models are doc so I got to talk
7882640	7888720	at length to Chris from area 52 who just got on Luigi from project gravitar Chris got me really
7888720	7896800	excited um did did you talk to him at all about gravitar um I no and I told him straight up the
7896800	7901520	reason I don't really talk about Bob Lazarus because I'm so biased towards Bob that it's difficult
7901520	7906880	for me to talk about it but he he got me hyped what do you see about Dan uh Dan's a documentary
7906880	7911520	filmmaker but he also produced movies uh notably ready player one which was okay
7913760	7919520	movie that aired in theaters 2018 that was one of the movies of all time yeah so as uh I've heard
7919520	7923120	that another hearing is happening on the 18th or whatever the next hearing is may you do I think
7923120	7927440	this is more a Senate hearing on arrows specifically so don't get your hopes up about that that's
7927440	7933600	going to be probably pretty dry it will be interesting to see how Kosolowski discusses kind
7933600	7938400	of the the arrows kind of operations you can comparing that back to how Kirk Patrick's made
7938400	7943280	those statements will answer five more and then and then we'll wrap up truth so I hated the comment
7943280	7948320	about some guy in a Winnebago the same thing happening now happens in the 40s 50s including the
7948320	7955920	52 flap uh who said who said that I that was uh that was the comment about like the credibility
7955920	7960240	of the witnesses like you guys aren't all just bunch of people living in a Winnebago that was
7960320	7964400	that was the comment oh to make fun of people going like to see craft outside of area 51
7964400	7968960	all the guys would get into something like something like that maybe I thought it was in
7968960	7974720	the context of like they were at like one of the representatives asked Elizondo like what his um
7974720	7978480	what his career kind of wasn't like what his experience was and it was like the point of like
7978480	7983360	okay you're not just like some crackpot in Winnebago okay well yeah needs to stop getting
7983360	7987360	names thrown around like crackpot ancient aliens or youtube being left on the stick but just needs
7987360	7992320	to stop yeah like Jimmy says thoughts on the document from Sarbakar on Oppenheimer von Neumann
7992320	7997520	being involved with crash retrievals I've covered Sarbakar very often and I think he's an extremely
7997520	8003760	credible individual you're pretty familiar with Sarbakar too right ish okay yeah I I would I put
8003760	8008160	a lot of I yeah but I am not surprised there especially because he's mentioned him at other
8008160	8013200	times as well uh let's see truth sauce did that bother you shouldn't these congress people be
8013200	8017920	more well informed for the same nuclear base incursions okay I understand your your comment
8017920	8023120	now in this context yes of course that bothers me I hate the name calling the throwing around
8023120	8027680	there's rude snide comments I hear outside and it's just what we do it Kermit just talked about
8027680	8036480	the byproduct of the stigma being so darn successful yeah uh okay let's uh let's go through uh see
8036480	8042080	awakening see a man Winnebago catching strays uh okay we'll do this one and then one more question
8042080	8046240	if one pops up while we're talking what are your thoughts on abductions uh this is still a difficult
8046240	8053520	question I love the work of John Mack uh it's difficult for me to connect abductions to what
8053520	8058480	I'd say my bread and butter is which is crash retrieval reverse engineering and witness testimony
8058480	8065840	analysis so uh the abductions are fascinating then there's a lot of witnesses under a career
8065840	8071120	that talk about human abductions for my lab purposes and so forth one witness in specific
8071120	8077600	10 8 9 2 and his witness log uh I need to do more due diligence and read more of John Mack's book
8077600	8082640	because I'm not closed off to the idea I'm just ill informed yeah I'm kind of in the same boat I mean
8082640	8087840	again my my bread and butter is the excel file that is the classified balance sheet and trying to see
8087840	8095120	that um but in terms of abductions like my thoughts of it is like you know kind of backed with Mack is
8095120	8100560	like Mack's kind of uh thesis of it is like you know these people are you know genuine they have
8100560	8105200	these experiences and they're telling like an accurate genuine account of their experience
8105200	8108880	now is that something that's happening physically like are they being physically taking from the
8108880	8113200	space and put into a spaceship or is this happening like within their mind of like they're
8113200	8117040	having this like experience within consciousness so they don't really understand but in their
8117040	8120720	brain they think it's like an abduction event you know it could be something like both but what I
8120720	8125920	will say is I'm kind of a you know I come from a Catholic background so I do fundamentally believe
8125920	8129280	in things like you know possession demonic possession things like that and I think that
8129280	8134320	there is a little bit of tie-in between those two things I wouldn't be surprised okay we got uh
8134320	8139680	three two more and we'll go through it or truth sauce three more we talked about we talked about
8139680	8144720	the new netflix series I haven't seen it have you seen uh investigation alien no but I'm watching
8144720	8151840	it this weekend okay perfect perfect uh damply dude says do you think uh do you think about UFOs
8151840	8155520	and aliens make them aware of you I think it's quite possible in any scenario the longer you
8155520	8160480	stare into the void the more it stares back that's one of the best realms of cosmic horror so I think
8160480	8165680	it's it's uh quite possible I've been told by some uh close friends you know not necessarily
8165680	8170080	experiencers but just like the the hitchhiker effect it will now be in play once you get
8170960	8175120	yeah closer but we have unfortunately we have not seen an orb in the hotel room no no yeah
8175840	8179040	I would like to see an orb in the hotel room that's kind of my that's kind of my thoughts on that
8179040	8185520	but yeah I've had nothing weird besides death threats to be honest troll mama thank you so much
8185520	8191840	I really appreciate you thank you very much uh thank you so much last question we'll get to
8191840	8195520	or I guess more of a comment and I will see if we have one more if UFOs are real we find out
8195520	8200880	craze are real the boom abductions are real simple as that I can't argue with it um shows the TR3b
8200880	8206400	while you're at it too all right please all right guys with that we'll wrap up tonight uh I hope
8206400	8211120	everybody enjoyed having Kermit on I'd certainly love to have him on more so show some love and uh
8211120	8214800	in the comments if you guys want to see him again and um you know if there's more hearings like
8214800	8219520	she hand said coming up we will be there and I'll get this dude in the the media room with me but
