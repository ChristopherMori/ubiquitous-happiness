WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Okay. We'll see. Hello, everybody. We are live. If you guys can hear, please just post

00:07.600 --> 00:14.720
in the comments that you're hearing us and we can get started. So I need to see, usually

00:14.720 --> 00:18.920
there, now the live counter's up. So there we go. Now it'll start populating. There's

00:18.920 --> 00:23.920
definitely more than, okay, zero people in. We've got 13 people here. What is up, guys?

00:23.920 --> 00:29.360
Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Somebody let us know. And then I need

00:29.360 --> 00:36.240
to hop on Twitter and say, and put the live link as well. So let's just see while this

00:36.240 --> 00:41.920
kind of sorts itself out. Sweet. They can hear us. I'd put it on my Twitter as well,

00:41.920 --> 00:46.440
but I have like two followers. Okay. Okay. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. So guys, let me post

00:46.440 --> 00:52.280
a tweet real fast, but I'll do another introduction as more people start filtering in. But this

00:52.280 --> 00:57.440
is Kermit. He is the researcher you guys know who helped me out with the SAIC. Hey, it's

00:57.440 --> 01:04.040
C. Britton. Yeah. He helped tremendously with SAIC, looking at contracts, working that

01:04.040 --> 01:08.840
case with me. So let me just get a tweet out real fast. Kermit, if you just want to introduce

01:08.840 --> 01:14.040
yourself while I'm doing this, please feel free. Hey, y'all. I'm Kermit. How's it going?

01:14.040 --> 01:20.200
I've been posting about UFO stuff under the Reddit name frog and badger. My kind of angle

01:20.200 --> 01:24.600
with this is kind of the legal financial framework, you know, specifically, you know,

01:24.600 --> 01:28.680
we heard today, I mean, yesterday from the representatives about how they're interested

01:28.680 --> 01:32.640
in how taxpayer funds are being spent on these programs. And that's kind of my, it's kind

01:32.640 --> 01:37.920
of my area of expertise and my intellectual curiosity, so to speak. So been very, very

01:37.920 --> 01:42.320
blessed to be able to work with Gerb the past couple of months on a bunch of different projects.

01:42.320 --> 01:47.040
He came to me over the summer is like, Hey, I want to put out this, this documentary on

01:47.040 --> 01:50.760
a company that you've been actually doing a lot of research on. And we did a really

01:50.760 --> 01:55.240
good collaboration for that. I'm actually very happy with how it turned out. And yeah,

01:55.240 --> 01:59.120
just been just digging through financial filings and trying to making, trying to make sense

01:59.120 --> 02:02.520
of this legacy program, you know, so the truth is out there.

02:02.520 --> 02:11.520
All right. All right. I'm almost done. Live. Sorry, guys. I'm just posting this on Twitter.

02:11.520 --> 02:16.760
Might as well just show everyone in the chat here. Gerb and I were able to visit the National

02:16.760 --> 02:21.600
Air and Space Museum and I was able to pick up a reproduction vehicle. If you want to

02:21.600 --> 02:28.560
call it that B2 stealth bomber. So for any right there, you know, for anybody that doesn't

02:28.560 --> 02:35.320
know there are classic stories of the B2 bomber utilizing, utilizing electrogravity technology

02:35.320 --> 02:41.560
for an internal mass reduction of up to 89% and then electrogravity technology to kind

02:41.560 --> 02:47.320
of obfuscate both exhaust signatures and radar cross section. So I'm posting this guys

02:47.320 --> 02:55.760
and then we shall get started right away. Let's do it. Okay. So we'll start just looking.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.400
What we'll do guys is we'll kind of talk about our time in DC. We're both in here right now

02:59.400 --> 03:07.120
at Capitol Hill. So I'd like to talk a little bit about DC and the hearings as well as we

03:07.200 --> 03:13.160
were able to attend the UAP disclosure fund meeting last night. So we got a lot to talk

03:13.160 --> 03:17.960
about. We'll talk about immaculate constellation and everything and then we'll kind of go through

03:17.960 --> 03:23.960
questions and so forth. So C's is asking right now, who is that guy? C's will say it again.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.200
He just introduced himself, but this is Kermit. He's the excellent researcher who helps me

03:28.200 --> 03:33.040
out with the SAIC research. His, his, the link to his Reddit will be in the description

03:33.040 --> 03:37.800
page. He's made some awesome posts on kind of analyzing the legacy program framework

03:37.800 --> 03:42.920
within SEC securities frameworks and stuff. And if you want to tell a little bit about

03:42.920 --> 03:46.440
that, I'm a little bit about that post. I'm sure people would love to hear that. Yeah,

03:46.440 --> 03:51.520
for sure. My, my most recent posts that I published, I want to say a month and a half

03:51.520 --> 03:56.520
ago, I kind of looked at kind of all the laws in the books around like national security

03:56.520 --> 04:02.160
programs and then not disclosing those operations on like a private company's financial statements.

04:02.560 --> 04:08.680
So going back like almost a hundred years back to the SEC act of 1934, which kind of

04:08.680 --> 04:12.040
historical context that was written into law because of the Great Depression and trying

04:12.040 --> 04:18.040
to reform the banking system, but included within the SEC act of 1934 was a specific

04:18.040 --> 04:23.120
exemption that allowed for the president and the heads of his executive agencies to waive

04:23.120 --> 04:27.160
reporting requirements for any company that was involved with classified activities under

04:27.160 --> 04:31.240
an executive order. So basically from that, and then throughout kind of the chronology

04:31.280 --> 04:35.360
over decades, we kind of see a strengthening of those laws and those regulations that allow

04:35.360 --> 04:40.440
for companies like Lockheed Martin, SAIC, you know, other defense primes to basically, you

04:40.440 --> 04:45.000
know, do this classified work and not be as transparent or use a little bit more discretion

04:45.000 --> 04:48.760
with how they report those operations in their financial statements.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.080
And that's such interesting work. I mean, I know of some other individuals who are trying

04:52.080 --> 04:56.200
to kind of attack legacy program for more of a financial framework. And this is something

04:56.240 --> 05:01.200
that I personally don't see enough in the industry and kind of UAP researchers. So I

05:01.200 --> 05:04.160
think that's really interesting, you know, carrying on the legacy of Katharine Austin

05:04.160 --> 05:09.440
Fitz, the black budget of the United States and so forth. I just, I just need to make

05:09.440 --> 05:14.160
sure we're caught up. I'm right now I'm worried about the this Wi-Fi here in the hotel. So

05:14.160 --> 05:18.360
I'm just checking up that our dang stream is live guys. I'm sorry. We're at the holiday

05:18.360 --> 05:25.480
in Capitol Hill and okay, we are perfect. It doesn't have the best Wi-Fi. Okay. So already

05:26.240 --> 05:31.320
I'm like in Kermit, dude. Kermit's the dog. We've been having so much fun. So, you know,

05:31.320 --> 05:36.960
we'll talk a little bit about the hearings. We both got in on Tuesday night. I was fortunate

05:36.960 --> 05:42.400
enough to get a media pass for the hearings. So that was awesome. Yeah. If you guys see

05:42.400 --> 05:48.840
some of the photos of, I think, who is it, Brett Higgins? Yeah. I mean, the profile picture

05:48.840 --> 05:53.320
of the video from, I think Higgins, I'm kind of right there on the side. It was really

05:53.400 --> 05:59.240
cool because, you know, right in front of the witnesses was Amar from the S Theory and some

05:59.240 --> 06:03.960
other photographers snapping away. You know, inside the room, we'll talk about that. We'll

06:03.960 --> 06:10.960
talk about the lines and so forth. This, we talked to many, many, many of the big dogs. Oh,

06:10.960 --> 06:16.600
you know, we did. We did. Oh yeah. Yes. And we'll also talk about the event horizon interview

06:16.600 --> 06:22.240
as well because something or someone I'm quite close to Ross, the producer of event horizon

06:22.240 --> 06:27.520
and then John Michael Godier. So I've been able to talk to them a ton. T.W. This is a

06:27.520 --> 06:32.960
friend of mine. There's no Peter here. This is Kermit, but thanks, Steve. Yeah. So doors

06:32.960 --> 06:37.880
for the house building, they opened at 7, 7 a.m. Actually earlier than that, there were

06:37.880 --> 06:43.000
people standing in line at like midnight, night before. I think one of them was Robert

06:43.000 --> 06:47.520
Salas, but I think some people like Matt from the Good Trouble show have been getting heat

06:47.560 --> 06:52.920
from Green Street because they actually paid professional waiters to wait in line. So I

06:52.920 --> 06:56.680
had a, because I had the media pass, you know, I was afforded a little extra time. I was

06:56.680 --> 07:01.200
going to go in right away, but I had some issues just sleep and do the excitement. So I had

07:01.200 --> 07:05.920
to wait maybe an hour or two before you. So he showed up at actual 7 a.m. So what was

07:05.920 --> 07:11.040
it like first doors, doors open and waiting to get in? Yeah. I mean, strolling, strolling

07:11.040 --> 07:16.200
down Capitol Ave to go to the Rayburn office building. I've never attended. I've never

07:16.240 --> 07:19.880
been inside like the Capitol building or any of that stuff. I've never attended hearings

07:19.880 --> 07:25.200
before. So this is like a new experience for me. And I showed up like in kind of the line

07:25.200 --> 07:29.840
for the UFO hearing at like about seven that morning. And at that point, like the line

07:29.840 --> 07:33.840
was very, very deep. And I will say there were a lot of people in that line at that point

07:33.840 --> 07:37.520
that I was like, Oh my God, like that's, that's Matt for that's Lester. Like, Oh my God. It

07:37.520 --> 07:42.240
was a verifiable like who's who have, you know, UFO world and got to take a lot of people's

07:42.280 --> 07:47.280
hands, got to meet a bunch of really cool people. Unfortunately, I was in kind of the

07:47.280 --> 07:51.720
point or the part of the line that ended up not making it into the main room. I was like

07:51.720 --> 07:56.440
10 people off from getting into that main area. But thankfully the staffers were able

07:56.440 --> 08:00.560
to take kind of the rest of us, put us up an overflow and watch that live upstairs.

08:00.560 --> 08:05.320
So I mean, not great, but you know, it is one of the picture of the overflow TV. Yeah,

08:05.320 --> 08:10.040
for sure. I felt terrible about these guys because, you know, I'll just say, yeah, show

08:10.120 --> 08:14.520
it. And then I'll make a quick comment because, you know, I got a lot to say from an almost

08:14.520 --> 08:21.000
exact opposite point of view. I mean, it seemed like going in like it seemed like the hearing

08:21.000 --> 08:25.200
room is going to be a bit bigger than the one last year. And it was the same hearing room

08:25.200 --> 08:30.480
guy. It was the exact same hearing room. Oh, was the exact? Yes. Yes. But there. So there

08:30.480 --> 08:36.480
was there were like, I think five rows of seats. Yeah. So this is, I don't know if you guys

08:36.520 --> 08:42.920
can see this. If you hold it closer, it should auto adjust. Oh, no. Yes. There we go. That's

08:42.920 --> 08:48.120
the TV. That was the screen that I was watching from everybody. Yeah. Front row seat kind

08:48.120 --> 08:52.640
of, which is cool. Let's get the camera to auto adjust. Oh, that adjusted poorly. There

08:52.640 --> 08:57.520
we go. Okay. It's starting to work. I won't, I won't show my phone. I won't show any other

08:57.520 --> 09:01.280
pictures. We're still washed out with light, but that's all right. So kind of from from

09:01.280 --> 09:05.760
my POV, I got to go in at a hearing started at 1130. I got to go in at 11 through the

09:05.800 --> 09:10.480
media entrance. Some other people who got to do that were Jesse Amar from Yes Theory,

09:10.480 --> 09:16.840
Chris from Area 52. He recently put out the, the Project Gravitar interview. And I got

09:16.840 --> 09:21.200
to talk to him. I never met him. He's awesome. I really liked speaking to him. Chris was

09:21.200 --> 09:25.480
great. You know, Jesse was rocking around and kind of his more laxed where I think it's

09:25.480 --> 09:29.840
so funny because only Jesse could get away with that. In line, you know, most people

09:29.840 --> 09:33.840
have their suits on. They're looking quite dapper. They're ready to go. And then there

09:33.840 --> 09:36.920
is, there's some people out there with like alien headbands on.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.320
There was, there was a lot of different fits on, man. There's, there were a bunch of different

09:40.320 --> 09:45.680
people. I mean, talk about, talk about a like very, it's just like, like all walks of life.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.200
You know what I mean? So then that was really cool to see too.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.680
All walks of life unifying.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.160
But the only person that could really pull it off, I'd say was, was Jesse. The only person

09:53.160 --> 09:58.160
who looked like normal in a sense with a kind of strange bloving on was Jesse. But yeah,

09:58.160 --> 10:02.080
some of the people that were pretty early in line were like Robert Salas. I think Chris

10:02.160 --> 10:07.520
Bledsoe was there. But as far as people meeting, waiting in line, waiting in line met a ton

10:07.520 --> 10:11.360
of people. There were actually a couple of people who recognized my name, which was really

10:11.360 --> 10:15.840
cool. There are a few people like that. It was awesome. It was great to talk to some people.

10:15.840 --> 10:23.040
So many people showed out. But you know, before getting in, talk to Jesse, Area 52, James

10:23.040 --> 10:27.720
Fox, a bunch. James Fox actually posted a video, kind of walking through the hall. And

10:27.720 --> 10:31.980
I think I walked right in front of him and I just looked like an idiot in that Lester

10:31.980 --> 10:36.680
Nair as well from the UAP Caucus. He's a friend of ours. He actually was one of the people

10:36.680 --> 10:43.920
who helped us get into the UAPDF. And that was really great. But so getting into the

10:43.920 --> 10:49.280
actual witness room, we got to get in 30 minutes early. And from there, some of the RSVP, some

10:49.280 --> 10:54.480
of the reserved seats got to pour in. And this took up about three or two and a half of the

10:54.480 --> 10:58.960
five rows. And of these people were people you'd expect, you know, Leslie Kane, we'll

10:58.960 --> 11:01.760
talk a little bit more about her later, because I actually got to talk to her for quite a

11:01.760 --> 11:08.720
while at the UAPDF. Jeremy Corbell, I have some good insights as to the drama there.

11:08.720 --> 11:17.960
Who else? James Fox, Jesse, Chris, Ryan Graves. A ton of people started pouring in and the

11:17.960 --> 11:22.200
witnesses even early. So before the hearing even started, I got to chat a little bit with

11:22.320 --> 11:26.720
Jeremy and so forth. I actually had a kind of a funny experience with him. I introduced

11:26.720 --> 11:32.200
myself to Jeremy. I said, you know, hello, my name is I gave him my first name. And he's

11:32.200 --> 11:35.080
like, where have I seen you before? And I said, maybe on YouTube under Gerb. And so he

11:35.080 --> 11:40.120
goes, yeah, one of your whistleblowers you spoke to is correct. I went, who? Like who? And

11:40.120 --> 11:42.800
he's like, that should be enough. He just refused to elaborate. He didn't wink at me and said

11:42.800 --> 11:47.360
he had to like center himself a little bit before the before the hearing. So Jeremy, you

11:47.360 --> 11:50.720
know, sometimes I criticize his work a little bit. Everyone's work can be criticized. Everyone's

11:50.760 --> 11:55.360
work has flaws, but he was a really nice guy. I really enjoyed speaking to him. He was a kind

11:55.360 --> 12:00.440
of a class act. However, after the hearing, which we'll discuss a little more, he was pretty

12:00.440 --> 12:07.120
upset that he was the one who gave Congress on that day, the 12 page Immaculate Constellation

12:07.120 --> 12:15.320
Report. I think Schellenberger's witness gave it to Burchett a while ago, right? But I believe

12:15.320 --> 12:19.880
the situation was at this current day that Jeremy gave the Immaculate Constellation Report

12:19.920 --> 12:27.080
to Mace and others. So there was a point where Mace, in the starting to talk about the hearings,

12:27.800 --> 12:35.680
Jeremy started like getting visibly extremely upset, extremely upset. And afterwards, you

12:35.680 --> 12:39.560
know, he was like on the brink of tears. He was so furious. And you know, some people were

12:39.560 --> 12:43.040
talking and trying to get pictures. And he was being really nice about that. He was taking

12:43.040 --> 12:48.160
pictures with everybody, kind of being a class act. But I say, you know, I talked to Merrick

12:48.160 --> 12:52.480
on Renekamp. I said, hey, that's a good Jeremy. And so he explained the situation to me. And so I

12:52.480 --> 12:56.960
went up to talk to Jeremy because this will be coming out in a little bit, but I got to interview

12:56.960 --> 13:02.200
Rhett Burrelson afterwards. Herman was actually my fellow man there. We got some good questions

13:02.200 --> 13:06.560
about there. It's not a super long interview. However, some of the questions asked were on

13:06.600 --> 13:14.200
was he expecting other witnesses? Because I think somebody, somebody, jit boy, yeah, by the way,

13:14.200 --> 13:20.720
I talked to introduce myself to Oak Shane, and I'm planning to talk to him more. But yeah, some

13:20.720 --> 13:26.520
of the questions asked without spilling any details were, you know, seen if, sorry, just

13:26.520 --> 13:33.200
got to, okay, was seen if Burrelson had expected other witnesses, right? Because we all heard

13:33.200 --> 13:37.120
rumors of firsthand, you know, let me first hand guys, crash retrieval, legacy program

13:37.120 --> 13:42.400
witnesses asked him about that, asked him specifically about ARV, asked him specifically

13:42.400 --> 13:46.280
if he's read the Grush op ed, which, you know, I'm sure people really want to hear about

13:46.280 --> 13:51.000
that. And asked him specifically if Congress has received actionable intelligence as it

13:51.040 --> 13:56.080
started to move on some of these locations that have been named. Yeah. So Burrelson, in my

13:56.080 --> 14:03.000
opinion, along with Luna and Moskowitz actually asked the whole all the best questions of the

14:03.040 --> 14:06.280
the hearing. So before we get into hearing and discussing some of the questions, what was

14:06.280 --> 14:11.320
asked, a couple funny points per chat with killing diet Mountain Dew, the whole whole show, I

14:11.360 --> 14:16.200
think he had three diet Mountain Dews and like loves that Mountain Dew and Michael Gold was

14:16.200 --> 14:20.640
just eating candy the whole time. He had a Lenovo laptop that had the greasiest trackpad I

14:20.640 --> 14:28.360
ever saw. Jimmy, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Seriously. Falcon head. We

14:28.360 --> 14:32.680
talked about this just now, but Corbell was upset because he submitted the 12 page Immaculate

14:32.680 --> 14:37.120
Constellation report to Nancy Mace right before the hearing. And it was attributed to

14:37.120 --> 14:43.560
Schellenberger, not not Corbell, when the report was kind of entered into the congressional

14:43.560 --> 14:48.000
record, and he was furious about that. And there were only 11 pages, not 12. I think Jesse

14:48.000 --> 14:53.840
just tweeted the last page. Oh, really? Yeah, from Jeremy Kenyon locker Corbell. So if you

14:53.840 --> 14:58.640
guys want to see that go to Jesse Michael's page. And also now's a good time. I posted a

14:58.640 --> 15:01.640
picture of it talked about a little bit because you got to meet Jesse, everybody got to meet

15:01.640 --> 15:09.720
Jesse. Last week, I was just out in Austin for to record a show for Jesse. And so that

15:09.720 --> 15:15.300
should be out soon. There we talk about everything from crash retrievals to the McCandless story

15:15.300 --> 15:22.920
to ARV to deep underground military bases. I added in some we actually go a little bit

15:22.920 --> 15:27.880
into ed the witness from Edwards Air Force Base. And we talked a little bit about his

15:27.880 --> 15:32.040
background kind of referencing some of his public stations and so forth. So I think that's

15:32.040 --> 15:35.320
going to be really interesting. Let's uh, while you're looking at that, I think we got

15:35.320 --> 15:39.160
two questions here, including one with Joey had one year to force just one grush hostile

15:39.160 --> 15:44.560
witness or aerospace exec to the stand, but bring gold new Congress one. Yeah, so I think

15:44.560 --> 15:51.280
gold is people are pretty hot and cold about gold, right? Yeah. He, you know, he was really

15:51.280 --> 15:58.520
pro NASA, which I think NASA is likely at least somewhat privy to UAP crash retrieval

15:58.520 --> 16:05.640
programs. And NASA has historically lied about UAP as well, including a study in 1979 or

16:05.640 --> 16:12.520
1980. It was a, sorry, 1978 or 1979. There were FOIA requests where NASA had previously

16:12.520 --> 16:16.360
stated they never looked into UAP, but a bunch of FOIA documents came out showing that NASA

16:16.360 --> 16:22.040
had been taking kind of an eye of UAP reports very seriously. So we will let's see what

16:22.040 --> 16:26.000
Joey says here. What's up, Joey? I thought someone quote for Chet St. Corbell was the

16:26.000 --> 16:30.200
guy who gave him a report months ago. I did hear something. Yeah, I did. I did as well

16:30.200 --> 16:35.480
that he was involved. Yeah. Additionally, have you so, Gurp, have you read the 12th page?

16:35.480 --> 16:40.760
You just skimmed it once. You know, yeah, it is. So it's a cover letter from George Jeremy

16:40.760 --> 16:45.160
Corbell. That was supposed to be the cover letter. And kind of talks a little bit about

16:45.200 --> 16:50.320
how he got the document and all that. But it's not like an additional page of the document.

16:50.320 --> 16:57.440
It's basically, it's, I believe Jeremy, you know, trying to, you know, convey that, you

16:57.440 --> 17:01.280
know, he's kind of a part of this effort, you know, in providing this report to Congress.

17:01.280 --> 17:05.560
I think that's what's really the meat of it. Yeah. Okay. I think someone in something

17:05.560 --> 17:11.520
in someone as well as Therose here both make good points. Well, you know, it's good to

17:11.520 --> 17:15.120
have a NASA guy calling for more transparency. It's still, you know, how much exactly can

17:15.120 --> 17:20.240
NASA be trusted. Also, this guy was connected with OSAP and Bigelow Aerospace. So why were

17:20.240 --> 17:24.760
questions not asked? And why was the topic not discussed about OSAP trying to kind of

17:24.760 --> 17:29.320
facilitate craft transfer from Lockheed Martin? Yeah, well, they didn't even name Lockheed

17:29.320 --> 17:34.640
Martin. I mean, Lou and others were quite afraid to even name it themselves. And then

17:34.640 --> 17:38.480
even like one of their Congress people was like, Oh, well, we know this is the Lockheed

17:38.560 --> 17:42.080
Martin case. And he said it out loud. But then when the response came back, it wasn't

17:42.080 --> 17:45.600
like, Oh, yeah, it was a con, they said it was a contract. Right. It was a contractor.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.040
But like, you know, as, as we've been kind of understanding the story over years, it's

17:49.040 --> 17:52.920
like, well, we know what that contractor is. So like, why are we being cagey about it?

17:52.920 --> 17:57.240
And where's the money trail? This is something we're digging. This is something that, there's

17:57.240 --> 18:03.400
something that Kermit, tracking down the financials of legacy programs we're trying to uncover.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.520
You know, there's reason to believe that sometimes programs are skimmed off of existing programs

18:07.560 --> 18:13.360
such as the F 35, a 1.5 to $2 trillion program that witness Ed served as a subject matter

18:13.360 --> 18:17.520
expert to various contracting companies after his time in reverse engineering programs at

18:17.520 --> 18:23.280
Air Force. Ed, this witness also stated while working on the R and D panel chain at the Pentagon

18:23.280 --> 18:28.880
that in two fiscal years, 34 billion and then 40 billion and non transfer of authority funds

18:28.880 --> 18:33.840
were kind of issued back channel to legacy programs under the Air Force. So kind of trying

18:33.840 --> 18:36.400
to track this stuff down, but let's see what two cents here.

18:36.400 --> 18:41.600
I have some, I have some sense on this as well. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So I think in terms of like

18:41.600 --> 18:45.920
funding, and we want to think about like kind of the avenues of what's kind of going on here,

18:45.920 --> 18:51.360
just over time, I think it's, you know, it would not surprise me if there's kind of a bunch of

18:51.360 --> 18:54.480
different things that are going on at play, because ultimately, right, you're just trying to

18:54.480 --> 18:58.960
obfuscate this financial data so that people that, you know, otherwise have that access to that

18:58.960 --> 19:03.040
information, they can't figure out what that money is actually going towards. Right. So I mean,

19:03.040 --> 19:08.000
in and of itself, the money trail is part of the obfuscation, trying to figure that out is about

19:08.000 --> 19:12.560
as important, I feel like is trying to see the crap and the bodies and all that stuff. So, you

19:12.560 --> 19:16.480
know, it's kind of one of those core tenets and, you know, the truth is out there, but I mean,

19:16.480 --> 19:19.680
I've been in this space for a year and a half, and I still have a bunch of different theories

19:19.680 --> 19:23.920
about it. So we can talk about it for sure. And that's why we're trying to kind of track down

19:23.920 --> 19:28.640
other people with a financial background like Kermit to really kind of make like a think tank

19:28.640 --> 19:33.360
on this subject, because I'm financially illiterate when it comes to tracking this stuff down. I can

19:33.360 --> 19:37.760
just report, like Witness Ed found $34 and $40 billion in non-TOA funds, but I can't really

19:37.760 --> 19:40.800
understand the significance of that or make heads or tails of a balance sheet.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.560
Yeah, because it's one thing for a witness to say, like, this is this is what I saw. But then,

19:44.560 --> 19:48.640
you know, that's the substantive evidence of like, I saw the ledger, I saw the transactions,

19:48.640 --> 19:52.960
this is corroborating basically that story. Right. Yeah, because yeah, Keegan was saying

19:52.960 --> 19:58.240
that's a lot of funds. Yes, it is. I mean, at the R&D panel chain, he was overseeing over 200

19:58.320 --> 20:02.880
billion per year in Air Force funds. Total just to kind of give everybody an idea,

20:02.880 --> 20:07.920
like when we talk about R&D and IRAD, right? Humulatively, the United States government spends

20:07.920 --> 20:14.080
about $150 billion annually just on defense R&D alone. That is a huge chunk of change. So,

20:14.080 --> 20:17.760
I mean, the number could be anywhere from zero to that or even something different than that

20:17.760 --> 20:21.440
entirely. We don't even know. Then there still exists the theory, and I don't know how we would

20:21.440 --> 20:25.600
explore this more, that some of these legacy programs, if they are being conducted out of a

20:25.920 --> 20:30.160
closed off military base, an underground base, perhaps they run off of closed systems.

20:30.880 --> 20:35.280
That's another possibility. Yeah, there are claims out there that some of these locations run

20:35.280 --> 20:40.400
off a cash-based system just as they do analog computers. Well, I'd be smart because you basically

20:40.400 --> 20:45.200
minimize the audit trail, you know, people, just like money talks, right? Right. So, people are

20:45.200 --> 20:49.600
spending money, if you have a, smaller the system and more closed than it is, the less chance that

20:49.600 --> 20:53.200
you have it of being uncovered. And we were at the Air and Space Museum today, and we were kind of

20:53.200 --> 20:57.920
hypothesizing, what if these programs with the craft like the ARV are able to just strip

20:57.920 --> 21:02.800
mine the asteroid belt for precious metals and so forth. Yeah, you don't even need to get capital

21:02.800 --> 21:06.480
or financing or anything here from earth, and you just get everything from your materials and

21:06.480 --> 21:11.600
products off world, then no one's the wiser, right? So, that makes sense. Two cents, thank you so much.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.520
Yeah, speaking of Seoul, Kermit and I will be going as well there. So, I know you guys are

21:17.520 --> 21:22.640
already showing Kermit a lot of love. We'll do another stream after Seoul as well. I can't wait

21:22.640 --> 21:26.640
to do that, and thank you again. Let me just, let me see this, and then we'll keep talking about

21:26.640 --> 21:32.240
the hearings. Thank you, Wag Boss, paying ties to the overlord. Now, I'll never be an overlord.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.480
Let's just hope John Jones gets knocked out this weekend, man, and I'll be a happy dude.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.680
So, you know, I'd like to say, and I'm sure we talked about this a little bit, I was impressed

21:41.680 --> 21:47.520
with Lou, not only with his testimony, but as a person as well. I was able to talk to him quite

21:47.520 --> 21:52.160
a bit, both before the hearings. I just bumped into him while I was scrambly to find the house

21:52.160 --> 21:57.200
building. I got coffee for a couple of friends. So, I'm just walking there. I see Lou outside.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.040
A guy followed by Kermas, and he's like two feet taller, I mean, two feet shorter than the rest of

22:03.040 --> 22:07.760
him. So, I know that's Lou, and I introduced myself and talked to him for a while. He was extremely

22:07.760 --> 22:15.280
kind. I think he did well answering questions as well into the congressional report. I've said

22:15.280 --> 22:19.680
this to you, and I'm sure you'll agree. There's still a lot of questions about Lou's background,

22:20.400 --> 22:27.520
ASAP and ATIP. Greenwald has diligently tried to get answers to for years, and how the heck are we

22:27.520 --> 22:33.760
going to get answers to what Lou's specific position was? Because now, of course, he has sworn

22:33.760 --> 22:38.240
into congressional testimony that he was a high-ranking member at ASAP, correct? Or was it ATIP?

22:38.240 --> 22:42.480
I'm just trying to remember off the top of my head. Well, I think that's the nature of the debate,

22:42.480 --> 22:47.920
is it not? I think in his book, he claims that he was part of both ASAP and ATIP. ASAP was kind of

22:47.920 --> 22:53.600
the initial effort where they were trying to get that divestiture from Lockheed, and then ATIP kind

22:53.600 --> 22:58.000
of was the effort post-ASAP once that kind of fell through. That's my understanding of it, at least.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.760
And I think one of the most consequential reports is Lou saying he cannot answer about being read

23:03.760 --> 23:08.400
into a congressional program. Yeah, that was quite telling. I thought that was very telling.

23:08.400 --> 23:15.840
So, Lou spoke at the UAPDF, which was kind of a closed event we were able to attend afterwards,

23:15.840 --> 23:21.680
and this speech saw fellow speeches by Representative Burleson and Representative Rounds.

23:21.680 --> 23:26.880
Senator Rounds. Yeah, sorry, Senator Rounds. So, this was a very consequential talk. I had some

23:26.880 --> 23:30.720
time to speak with Lou, because I know a long time ago I had kind of informed some friends that,

23:31.360 --> 23:36.080
via an analyst friend, that Lou would be agreeable to interview. Well, after this congressional

23:36.080 --> 23:40.720
testimony, I'd like to interview him now, actually interview him in person, because

23:41.600 --> 23:45.520
especially with his testimony, with Lou's media tour, I was kind of worried about

23:46.640 --> 23:50.000
not really being able to approach with fresh questions, because he's kind of answering everything.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.440
He's doing like 50 podcasts, but now I would really like to speak to him and just kind of

23:55.440 --> 24:04.320
ask him to expand on some of the things he said and kind of testified to. I think, number one,

24:04.320 --> 24:10.080
and I'm not going to be able to solve this on my platform, but to kind of clear up more issues

24:10.080 --> 24:15.440
around ATIP and OSAP. Yeah. It's like Katsky, Stratton, Kelleher. Everybody's got a little

24:15.440 --> 24:20.880
different bit of a different spin. Eric Davis. Well, they discussed Jay Stratton as well during

24:20.880 --> 24:25.600
the hearings too, and I think he's also coming out with his book imminently, not the name of it,

24:25.600 --> 24:30.400
but it's coming out quite soon. Well, hopefully we can talk to Eric Davis about this next week

24:30.400 --> 24:33.680
at Sol, right? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Because, first of all, I'd like to thank you

24:33.680 --> 24:39.440
so much, Siwan, for the $5. I really appreciate that. Sol is actually speaking at, or Schrock is

24:39.440 --> 24:44.800
speaking at Sol next week, and he's also doing a Q&A. I believe it's with Eric Davis, right?

24:46.240 --> 24:49.360
Sounds right. Okay, so yeah, there should be some good stuff. Let me go through these,

24:49.360 --> 24:54.400
and we'll keep talking. Django, I love that pig. Thank you so much for the $15,

24:54.400 --> 24:58.640
and Fat Rodents, thank you very much. Does this change what you'll ask at Sol at all?

24:58.640 --> 25:03.040
Well, I'd like to interview some people at Sol, so we'll see what we can do there. I've

25:04.000 --> 25:07.040
talking with Kermit, we're trying to work out some stuff for him to

25:08.000 --> 25:12.560
you know, maybe go in a little bit more on some good camera equipment and actually travel around

25:12.560 --> 25:17.200
to get some good interviews, but not just interviews, right? Like actual documentaries

25:17.200 --> 25:20.720
spliced in with research and so forth, because interviewing Lou, I don't just want to

25:21.600 --> 25:26.480
sit in front of a camera with him for two hours, but add in research. So I'd just like to ask you,

25:26.480 --> 25:35.920
Kermit, what would, could you rank in terms of impact and efficacy and just all around feel,

25:35.920 --> 25:41.120
who do you think was the most consequential person to testify to least? And guys in the chat,

25:41.120 --> 25:44.640
give me a one through four, one being the most consequential, four being the least.

25:44.640 --> 25:53.120
That's a good question. I'd say probably most consequential. I don't know, my personal

25:53.120 --> 25:56.560
perspective of it is like the questions themselves are the controversial, you know,

25:56.560 --> 26:02.800
that was the provocative stuff. But in terms of people, I would say Gallaudet being there and

26:02.880 --> 26:07.920
being a representative from, you know, the Navy and Noah and being very high up in those positions,

26:08.880 --> 26:13.680
you know, he being a representative of U.S. military and that kind of cohort and then

26:14.400 --> 26:18.240
Elizondo representing military intelligence, Schellenberger being a journalist and then

26:18.240 --> 26:22.800
finally Michael Gold being a scientist, right? So it was like, I felt like the panel overall

26:22.800 --> 26:27.680
was very well stocked and it was diverse and it had all the people that we want to hear from

26:27.680 --> 26:33.520
about this subject. I think Gallaudet was probably, for me, I think that that was probably the most

26:33.520 --> 26:37.760
interesting, like those questions and those answers were probably the most interesting because we've

26:37.760 --> 26:41.360
heard from Lou, you know, from his books and interviews and all this stuff and he does discuss

26:41.360 --> 26:45.600
a lot of it and there was certainly some interesting things discussed today with him,

26:46.320 --> 26:52.720
sorry, yesterday. But I'd say Gallaudet, I also think Michael Gold, I was actually very impressed

26:52.720 --> 26:56.880
with the way that he kind of spoke about it and I think you spoke very positively about just like

26:56.960 --> 27:02.320
NASA collaborating on this in the future and just kind of moving past the stigma that we see with

27:02.320 --> 27:07.360
this topic and just trying to get, you know, the scientific community really to take this

27:07.360 --> 27:12.800
seriously and investigate it. So I would say Gallaudet and Michael Gold were my top two picks.

27:12.800 --> 27:19.440
I loved Lou, I loved what he got to say and I really, I was really impressed with the way

27:19.440 --> 27:23.680
that, you know, he presented himself and he was just being very, you know, frank with those

27:23.680 --> 27:27.920
responses as well and, you know, he can't talk outside of, you know, the documents and the

27:27.920 --> 27:32.800
things that he signed and, you know, all that stuff. So, and I know that's frustrating for a lot of

27:32.800 --> 27:38.400
people but I still thought it was very positive. I agree and, you know, I've seen a lot of bitterness

27:38.400 --> 27:44.640
online kind of about the efficacy of the hearings. I agree with everybody that I also expected,

27:44.640 --> 27:49.120
as did Burleson, first-hand retrieval witnesses or first-hand program witnesses.

27:49.280 --> 27:54.720
However, I, yeah, we won't, I'll wait, I'll say that before the interview with Burleson but

27:54.720 --> 28:00.560
just Burleson was expecting other people to testify as well or in place of, we didn't specify

28:00.560 --> 28:06.240
about that. But I do think one of the key takeaways here with Immaculate Constellation is

28:06.240 --> 28:13.120
kind of an existing proof now of DOD lying about a USAP. You know, the protocol for a USAP and

28:13.120 --> 28:17.680
unacknowledged special access program is deny, deny, deny. They can't even, they can't even say

28:17.680 --> 28:22.080
anything. You know, like even an admission or a denial would like. But if your back's against

28:22.080 --> 28:27.680
the wall then you misinform. That's the protocol. Deny. If you cannot deny anymore, you misinform.

28:27.680 --> 28:31.440
So, I think this was important to see because, you know, there's so many statements from Susan.

28:31.440 --> 28:36.320
Susan Goh is saying Immaculate Constellation is not a program and so forth. I do think the 12-page,

28:37.360 --> 28:42.080
you know, report, which is super interesting, which we'll get into in a little bit. You know,

28:42.080 --> 28:46.560
Kermit and I have been talking at length about one specific report from there and, of course,

28:46.640 --> 28:50.960
the term alien reproduction vehicle, which I kind of got on Schellenberger's a little bit case,

28:50.960 --> 28:55.680
a little bit for omitting from his congressional submission. But he didn't even mention that at

28:55.680 --> 28:59.920
all in his testimony, which I was a little bit disappointed of. And I even asked Jeremy about

28:59.920 --> 29:03.040
that. I said, hey, Jeremy, you know, why didn't he do that? He was like, well, you can just ask

29:03.040 --> 29:06.880
him why they lied. He was too hot under the collar to do that. We'll take a quick break,

29:06.880 --> 29:10.000
look at a couple of questions. What do you think about Nancy May's selling UFO brain

29:10.000 --> 29:16.640
and merch? I think it's a bad taste. Yeah, I will say, you know, seeing kind of the

29:17.920 --> 29:21.440
representatives and how they've kind of been tweeting about this, like that seems positive.

29:21.440 --> 29:26.960
But then, you know, seeing the merch that's being sold, it's just on the nose, you know,

29:26.960 --> 29:31.840
and it's like a UF, it's a shirt of like a UF phone. It's got Nancy May's like in it.

29:31.840 --> 29:37.120
I think it's bad taste. I think it's bad taste. I like this idea a lot, Magic, and I will absolutely

29:37.120 --> 29:42.880
ask him about it. So, okay, what's your guys' thoughts on the simulation hypothesis?

29:43.600 --> 29:48.000
Pretty interesting. Of course, there's a great podcast on the simulation hypothesis that

29:48.000 --> 29:52.560
kind of states that in the future, if the civilization has the computing power to conduct

29:52.560 --> 29:56.640
a simulation of a whole hypothesis, that means they won't just stop at one simulation. They

29:56.640 --> 30:00.160
will conduct numerous, possibly even infinite. And therefore, if there's infinite simulated

30:00.160 --> 30:05.120
hypotheses of universes in the future that yours is statistically more likely to be a simulated

30:05.120 --> 30:08.960
one. It's interesting, but, you know, I can't prove it. What do you say, Kerm?

30:08.960 --> 30:11.840
It's just too much bandwidth for me, man. I just show me an Excel file.

30:11.840 --> 30:17.120
He likes money. Yeah, he likes money. I'm into the credits. Show me a 10K. I mean,

30:17.120 --> 30:22.800
it's not, I wouldn't be surprised if that's, like, I feel like what Grush said last year,

30:22.800 --> 30:26.160
I think, is a pretty good, pretty good description. Holographic.

30:26.160 --> 30:30.320
Yeah, he's just like, whatever, he kind of had this line where he's like, you know,

30:30.320 --> 30:33.360
you kind of look in places in the universe. It seems like things are just a little too

30:34.000 --> 30:38.800
perfect. You know what I mean? And, you know, I don't know. I feel like that's kind of where I

30:38.800 --> 30:42.400
kind of stand with this. Like, you know, the more we kind of understand the world around us,

30:42.400 --> 30:47.120
it's like we really get to understand, like, why we're here and, like, what's the nature of existence.

30:47.120 --> 30:52.320
And yeah, what's interesting, though, is, you know, Rizwan Burke, he's going to be at the,

30:52.320 --> 30:56.320
he's going to be at Seoul, and he's going to give a discussion about the simulation.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.960
Ooh, that's going to be, we'll have to talk about that post.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.320
He also on Joe Rogan said he knew people in the legacy program as well.

31:02.320 --> 31:07.600
Diddy. Okay, we'll have to talk about that as well. So, Schellenberger, Lou, Gallaudet,

31:07.600 --> 31:12.160
and Gold, I think it was an extremely poor taste for Higgins or whoever it was that

31:12.160 --> 31:17.440
was trying to burn Schellenberger's whistleblower. Yeah, I wasn't, I don't know. I thought,

31:17.440 --> 31:22.560
I thought Higgins' line of questioning was like kind of half-baked a little bit. And I get,

31:22.560 --> 31:26.080
yeah, I get that you guys are trying to figure out what the source is. But like, at the end of

31:26.080 --> 31:30.480
the day, Schellenberger was literally said he was willing to go to jail to protect that source.

31:30.480 --> 31:34.800
So, you just got to respect that. So, Siwon, thank you again for the next five bucks, man.

31:34.800 --> 31:40.080
Yeah, Schrock. So, isn't just a former director of Skunkworks on the USAF advisory board. He

31:40.080 --> 31:45.280
probably did about know about the OSAP transfer. So, I really hope we can hear about that at Seoul.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.840
So, it would be very interesting to hear from him next week.

31:47.840 --> 31:52.560
Gold, Schellenberger, Gallaudet, Elizondo. I know something or someone, I know you're not the

31:52.560 --> 31:58.080
biggest Elizondo proponent. The thing that worried me the most about Gallaudet speaking

31:58.080 --> 32:04.880
was kind of reinforced. First of all, I loved Tim Gallaudet. Hermit can see, Tim's my boy,

32:04.880 --> 32:11.440
we spoke quite a bit. Super nice guy. I've talked to him a lot before he had seen the channel with

32:11.440 --> 32:18.960
the USO videos. But I was worried because when Chris Sharpe's reporting on Neuro and undersea

32:18.960 --> 32:23.280
crash retrievals came out with Wood Soul Ocean, a graphic institute, and Lockheed Martin Drys

32:23.280 --> 32:29.120
Immersible, I reached out to Gallaudet and I just said, hey, sir, can we talk about these

32:29.120 --> 32:33.920
underwater crash retrievals? And he told me, I don't know anything about it. And at that point,

32:33.920 --> 32:40.160
I rationed, okay, he's bound by NDA. He can't speak about this. It makes sense. I'll back off.

32:40.160 --> 32:44.800
But then, of course, at the hearing, he said he'd never signed an NDA towards anything.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.240
He did say that. Yeah.

32:46.240 --> 32:52.640
That does worry me a little bit. He doesn't know about USO retrievals. Harry, thank you very much.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.320
Who was your favorite during the breaks, meetups, and formal chats?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.480
Probably Burleson, to be honest.

33:01.200 --> 33:05.440
Yeah, I thought our conversation with Burleson, post hearing. And then he was also at the UAPDF,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.160
post party as well. We got some FaceTime there as well.

33:08.720 --> 33:14.000
It was really great talking to him. He's a sharp cat. We also got to talk to numerous house staffers

33:14.000 --> 33:19.920
as well. Oh, yeah. We'll get into that once we finish up the hearings. But we'll just say for

33:19.920 --> 33:24.720
now, we got a lot of business cards, which was great. Contact information was exchanged.

33:24.720 --> 33:29.440
Okay. Jim Chu says, on what impact, if any, will Trump have on deeper disclosure?

33:29.440 --> 33:34.560
I already think that he's making consequential moves by placing men like Rubio in power, which

33:34.560 --> 33:39.360
Rubio, of course, has been trying to subpoena and interview witnesses since at least 2008.

33:39.360 --> 33:42.480
And Matt Gaetz being the attorney general, that was just announced today. I think that's

33:42.480 --> 33:46.720
significant. I think he's setting up a pretty pro-disclosure cabinet.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.080
I know there's been a lot of talks as well with this Department of Government Efficiency,

33:50.080 --> 33:54.320
which seems to be more and more like a real thing. Elon Musk, Vivek, Rama Swamy, if you guys are

33:54.320 --> 33:58.400
watching this stream, I would love to join the effort in specifically trying to audit this

33:58.400 --> 34:04.240
legacy program activity. Hey, let's get this man in doge. That'd be pretty cool. So what stuck out

34:04.240 --> 34:11.120
to Throsey here was the idea of tracking ARVs. This implies that foreign ARVs are uncontrolled,

34:11.600 --> 34:17.840
domestic ARVs. I think both probably remember, this is something that even Congress really got

34:17.840 --> 34:24.080
wrong. Immaculate Constellation is not a legacy program. This was made in 2017 in an attempt to,

34:24.880 --> 34:31.600
I guess, umbrella over both legacy program and UAP. And it happened concurrent with Lou Elizondo

34:32.160 --> 34:36.720
coming out public with the New York Times order. So Immaculate Constellation would not have

34:37.520 --> 34:42.080
access. Members of Immaculate Constellation would not have read-on access to, let's say,

34:42.080 --> 34:47.840
the Air Force legacy program that tests ARV crap. Possibly. I mean, we don't really know how

34:48.560 --> 34:55.120
consolidated those databases are because it does talk about, I think, the overall structure of

34:55.120 --> 35:00.080
Immaculate Constellation is like a reporting. So it gets these UFO reports, this raw data that's

35:00.080 --> 35:05.200
coming in, and it silos it based on the imagery and the intelligence that they have behind that.

35:05.280 --> 35:11.840
So does that database also include stuff pre-2017? Well, I don't really know. But what I will say is,

35:12.640 --> 35:17.680
within the Immaculate Constellation report, this 11-page report, it does talk about imagery and

35:17.680 --> 35:24.800
human intelligence reports. And the scope of those encounters goes back to 1991. So that's

35:24.800 --> 35:31.920
pre-2017. So does Immaculate Constellation have that pre-2017 data? Maybe. It just really depends

35:31.920 --> 35:38.000
on what this author of this document had access to. And if it was all IC, Immaculate Constellation.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.840
Maybe. But I've also asked some of my friends who are analysts in satellite industry, so they

35:43.840 --> 35:48.640
could look back to 1974 for the Koyama incident, and they said, that's too far back. We have a cutoff.

35:49.360 --> 35:56.240
So I think for some of these space-based systems, that data is just not available.

35:57.040 --> 36:03.120
But I also do think that the programs are even between Army, Navy, and Air Force,

36:03.120 --> 36:07.840
probably the three largest legacy programs, that there's very little communication or cross-referencing

36:07.840 --> 36:14.960
between those programs. So it'd be interesting to find out who the witness of Schellenberger is,

36:14.960 --> 36:19.200
and who ran the Immaculate Constellation program. It was said that this was an individual in the

36:19.200 --> 36:24.400
executive branch. Possibly State Department. Possibly State Department. That's at least

36:24.400 --> 36:30.560
the witness, I think, Ross Goldhart has said. I think so. But I am of the mind that there are

36:31.760 --> 36:36.960
domestic ARBs that probably even the executive branch and Immaculate Constellation has no idea

36:36.960 --> 36:41.760
about. Yeah, but also I think probably the most interesting part is that we do have foreign

36:41.760 --> 36:47.200
intelligence of foreign ARBs, and those are included within the Immaculate Constellation

36:47.200 --> 36:53.040
report. And we have imagery and videos of this stuff. Specifically of the case that occurred

36:53.040 --> 36:58.960
over the Indo-Pacific region of a large black triangle, which if that's the case, you know,

36:58.960 --> 37:02.640
we were just at the Spy Museum and we saw some imagery of China ripping off and reverse

37:02.640 --> 37:06.640
engineering a predator drone. This would also mean that China ripped off and reverse engineered a

37:06.640 --> 37:11.760
TR3D. Hey, I do the same thing all the time. Kermit, here's a question for you, sir. There was

37:11.760 --> 37:17.040
some speculation regarding the involvement of Pacific architects and engineers outbidding

37:17.040 --> 37:23.280
OSAP for the locking materials. Anything there? That's a great question. Yeah, I so I've been

37:23.280 --> 37:28.960
referred to Pacific architects and engineers quite some times. As I understand it, they were later

37:28.960 --> 37:36.000
required by Lockheed Martin, I think. Yeah, I haven't really looked into it a ton. I know that

37:36.000 --> 37:42.320
they did become involved like post OSAP trans like that same timeline still exists. So very

37:42.320 --> 37:48.000
interesting, but I will say I think it's a fairly small organization. Like it's mostly like an

37:48.000 --> 37:52.880
engineering consulting services group that's I think less than a thousand, five thousand employees.

37:52.880 --> 37:59.360
I could be completely wrong here. But yeah, no, I know I know the name Pacific architects. I don't

37:59.360 --> 38:05.120
know a ton about it. But yeah, I'll just nod my head and smile. That just means follow up research.

38:05.120 --> 38:11.280
So that's awesome. Trump could pardon Trump could pardon anyone under UAP non-disclosure.

38:11.280 --> 38:17.680
I think amnesty should be truth and reconciliation. Yeah, truth. Unless it's a it's like a person

38:17.680 --> 38:22.880
that has killed somebody for the sake of secrecy. Yeah, like if these are not, I don't know. I don't

38:22.880 --> 38:28.400
even know if like the JSOC members in the 2004, if that's a true case, the blue on blue JSOC,

38:28.400 --> 38:32.160
we've been killed by Lockheed retrieval members, if that's a true case, and those guys are acting

38:32.160 --> 38:38.880
under strict orders. But I don't know if if you're a men in black assassin trying to who visited

38:38.880 --> 38:43.680
Mark McCandless's house in 2021, I don't know how much you should receive amnesty.

38:43.680 --> 38:48.880
It feels almost like it would be almost like a military version of a record case, right? Because

38:48.880 --> 38:51.520
it's like you have all these people working on these different programs following orders. But at

38:51.520 --> 38:55.680
the end of the day, who's really making decisions? So if you really want like full disclosure, truth

38:55.680 --> 39:00.800
and reconciliation, sending people to jail as well for, you know, illegal activity, I feel like

39:00.800 --> 39:05.120
the ultimate responsibility is like the people, you know, Depsec, whatever, that are in these

39:05.120 --> 39:10.080
high up positions making these orders, right? So who ultimately is responsible for that? I don't

39:10.080 --> 39:13.360
know. We don't know. We're still trying to figure that out. Maybe it's Cheney. He should have been

39:13.360 --> 39:17.680
in jail a long time ago. He's probably sits at the top of the pyramid. So Mace is a grifter. I'd

39:17.680 --> 39:21.200
like to get your opinion on this. I think she's more of just an opportunist who doesn't really

39:21.200 --> 39:28.560
understand maybe some context around UFOs and kind of the disinformating cartoonists and grifters,

39:28.560 --> 39:33.680
if you want to call him that. So I understand like calling calling grifter just from seeing the

39:33.680 --> 39:39.600
shirt. I totally understand it. But okay, calling calling Mace a grifter. I just I think it's just

39:39.600 --> 39:44.320
the poor taste of her. Yeah, it's just poor. I think it's just poor taste. And honestly, I think

39:44.320 --> 39:49.200
it's probably like a staffer or something. Yeah. That's, Hey, you know, we're trying to have some

39:49.200 --> 39:53.920
UFO brain and merch out there so that, you know, our constituents know, you know, this is this will

39:53.920 --> 40:00.480
be. Yeah. So Siwan, thank you again. You talked to a staffer at that the committee had heard about

40:00.560 --> 40:05.840
Schrock and his story. Not sure why he didn't testify. I was thinking, yeah, once I once I'd

40:05.840 --> 40:10.640
saw a truck was going to talk at Seoul, I was assuming he was going to be one of the witnesses

40:10.640 --> 40:14.880
today. That was very surprising for me. So one of the things at Seoul is there's some time for

40:14.880 --> 40:21.360
meet and greets and so forth along with the Q&A. So we will I promise you try and pull Schrock for

40:21.360 --> 40:27.760
an interview. I would do anything for that. So we'll scroll down here. So this is talking a little

40:27.760 --> 40:32.000
bit throws. He's talking a little bit more about Mace. They're selling a platform for fundraising

40:32.000 --> 40:38.560
for Republicans. But yes, bad taste. Okay. We all agree there. So here's a question or statement

40:38.560 --> 40:42.800
from Hokey. It would be interesting for you to talk with the lawyer in the military space. What

40:42.800 --> 40:47.440
are the potential legal mechanisms? 1950s era executive orders, DOE exceptions that could keep

40:47.440 --> 40:52.640
this hushed up. I didn't like being a good person to us to talk to. Yeah. And then also, I mean,

40:52.640 --> 40:56.880
this is, I mean, at least in the legal financial area, right? Like there's a bunch of stuff in,

40:56.880 --> 41:02.960
you know, the SEC Act, the Code of Federal Regulations that allow not just for like the

41:02.960 --> 41:06.720
president, but also like to your point, right, Department of Energy, they can provide like

41:06.720 --> 41:12.720
the executive agencies can provide these exemptions specifically for corporations or people or

41:12.720 --> 41:17.680
agencies that are involved in, you know, above black or above board activities like that.

41:17.680 --> 41:21.040
So I'm just trying to look at the questions because then we'll get back to the hearings.

41:22.000 --> 41:28.320
So Nell, I only heard from the disclosure Mike account, and he was also talking about other

41:28.320 --> 41:34.160
witnesses, like firsthand triangle witnesses. So maybe this was, maybe his sources

41:34.960 --> 41:38.160
were a little bit behind. Maybe there was something that was supposed to happen. But

41:38.160 --> 41:44.560
no, I personally heard none of Nell supposing to have testified. Yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to

41:44.560 --> 41:51.280
hear him. Okay. Sorry. Okay. A question about Michael, does he know when he'll be able to go

41:51.280 --> 41:58.160
back to the black side? I do not know. I have no idea. Michael used to work at Bigelow and that

41:58.160 --> 42:02.960
wasn't mentioned in his bio. Also NASA is the, yeah, I've ever worked for NASA is not transparent.

42:02.960 --> 42:06.480
I can give you guys, I mean, I think I've talked about it multiple times, like in the Moon dust

42:06.480 --> 42:13.200
video where NASA has lied. Anyone see SAIC took its biggest one day loss today? No, actually,

42:13.600 --> 42:18.000
today, today with post earnings, what's going on here? Oh no. I don't know. Yeah. Well,

42:18.000 --> 42:22.080
let Kermit pull that up while I get, while I get the next question. The one day we go run the streets

42:22.080 --> 42:28.720
looking at museums, the SAIC tanks. How did I have such a great seat? I had a good friend who

42:28.720 --> 42:34.720
helped me get media for this really good friend. I'm very thankful too. And so I owe all of that

42:34.720 --> 42:39.360
to that, that person. Have you guys read the 11 page paper? Yes, we're about to talk about it too

42:39.360 --> 42:50.800
once we finish up with the hearings as well. Okay, let's see. Eli, shout out event horizon.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.360
It's not just at SAIC. It's actually a, so what's going on with SAIC is actually being seen at

42:57.360 --> 43:02.720
Litos, Amentum and a couple other defense primes. It seems to be some type of uncertainty in the

43:02.720 --> 43:07.440
defense market at its current, at this current moment. I wonder what's causing that. I wonder

43:07.440 --> 43:14.080
what's causing that. I'm just looking for, for triangles. Siwon, thank you. You are giving a

43:14.080 --> 43:20.000
lot of cash. Thank you so much, man. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Thank you

43:20.000 --> 43:26.800
as well, Jimmy Shoe. I'm looking for questions right now, guys. Yeah, I think I saw this as

43:26.800 --> 43:30.480
well to Douglas Dean Johnson and Kirkpatrick provided several points too. I don't know,

43:31.680 --> 43:35.200
Debunk, I think he might have raised some interesting points. I haven't fully read what,

43:35.200 --> 43:42.400
what he said. Yeah, so his, his belief, right, I think it's kind of just scrutinizing and assessing

43:42.400 --> 43:48.400
this document, right? So first off, this is written by somebody in the Department of Defense and then

43:48.400 --> 43:53.440
was approved by the Department of State Public Affairs. Kirkpatrick basically said in his response,

43:53.440 --> 43:57.920
this is completely bogus. This is completely made up. This isn't what happens. Not to mention,

43:57.920 --> 44:03.360
this 11 page document is not on any official letterhead. It does not seem to be any sort of like,

44:03.840 --> 44:08.720
formalized or standard report memo. Otherwise, it's coming out officially of an agency. This

44:08.720 --> 44:14.000
seems like, I don't know, like it could be somebody typing up this report. Is this somebody in the

44:14.000 --> 44:19.840
government? Is this somebody that's not in the government? Ultimately, we don't, we don't really

44:19.840 --> 44:25.040
entirely know, but I think some of the things that we would expect from government documents are

44:25.040 --> 44:29.440
absent from this 11 page report. And then especially now that it's been entered into the

44:29.440 --> 44:32.720
congressional record and everyone's kind of talking about it, it's like, obviously, the

44:32.720 --> 44:39.600
scrutiny has just increased. Yeah. Yeah. So how did the panel get selected? Felt more like a

44:39.600 --> 44:44.960
variety show, which I agree with you. I have no idea how the panel got selected. All I know is

44:44.960 --> 44:49.680
that for this hearing specifically from Burleson, as well as a person I talked to connected with

44:49.680 --> 44:55.040
the intelligence community at the UAPDF, there have been other instances where witnesses were

44:55.040 --> 45:00.960
intimidated almost like up to the time they were supposed to, supposed to testify. So, you know,

45:00.960 --> 45:07.760
I'm not exactly sure the issues here, but I don't know how this was selected. I mean, I

45:07.760 --> 45:11.360
probably would have chosen a little bit of a different lineup or possibly even more witnesses,

45:11.360 --> 45:16.560
but, you know, I'm not necessarily sure. I felt like they did a good job just, again, kind of

45:16.560 --> 45:22.400
selecting a group of people that kind of represented different aspects kind of of this. And you have

45:22.400 --> 45:27.840
like naval intelligence, you know, journalism, science. I thought that that was a pretty good

45:27.920 --> 45:34.480
mix of people. Right. I do think that the hearings were varied enough from last years.

45:34.480 --> 45:40.480
However, we need first-hand, not first-hand experiencers, but first-hand whistleblowers

45:40.480 --> 45:44.080
involved. Like touch the craft. You've been in the basement, you've seen the stuff. Yes.

45:45.120 --> 45:50.320
But I don't know, saying you've seen the stuff, mentioning the technologies and mentioning the

45:50.320 --> 45:54.880
locations would then be violating your special access programs that you've been read into in

45:54.880 --> 46:00.720
legacy. So the consequences for that would likely be severe. Yeah. And I imagine those are the type

46:00.720 --> 46:06.560
of people that would be told on their way to testify, to turn back or bad things will happen.

46:06.560 --> 46:12.800
Yeah, that could be happening. Crackerjack, thank you so much for the 20 big month. It is a big

46:12.800 --> 46:18.720
month. We got a lot of stuff and we still got soul coming up. Traveling across the country for UAPs.

46:19.440 --> 46:24.560
So, sorry, I'm just looking at, did you already talk about the Kuwait UAP that

46:24.560 --> 46:29.600
Sheldon Berger mentioned? Not yet, which we will. I'd also, in the report, which I thought was

46:29.600 --> 46:34.560
interesting, was the mention of the Orbs flying circles around the F-22s, right?

46:34.560 --> 46:41.600
Yep. And then also, I think that same incident at the Orbs escorted the F-22 out of the

46:42.560 --> 46:48.800
missionary. So this pilot is on their way to do this mission. And then all of a sudden,

46:48.800 --> 46:53.200
they get surrounded by Orbs that are doing all these tricks around it. And then the Orbs are

46:53.200 --> 46:58.000
like, get out. As I was reading that report, I'm just trying to picture it for myself. I'm like,

46:58.000 --> 47:04.720
that's got to be airing on. And that reminds me of the Donald Trump on JRE, who talks about speaking

47:05.040 --> 47:11.760
to F-22 pilots who observe. Yeah, specifically F-22. So do those correlate? I don't think it's

47:11.760 --> 47:16.320
a stretch to say yes. William, I've been awesome, man. How are you doing? Sorry I've been a little

47:16.320 --> 47:21.520
dark between Jesse and this and soul has so much going on. I do have a project coming out and it

47:21.520 --> 47:27.520
should be within the week that I'm really excited. Really excited. Yes, we talked about this. It

47:27.520 --> 47:31.120
appears the report came from Corbell, not Schellenberger. A lot of drama around there.

47:31.120 --> 47:36.560
Schellenberger just had an interview with Jesse. I haven't had the opportunity to watch it yet,

47:36.560 --> 47:41.200
but I would like to see that. I would like to see that. So let me just look for questions here,

47:41.200 --> 47:45.520
guys, so then we'll keep talking. You guys asked so many great questions, especially the stuff

47:45.520 --> 47:51.040
of current. Keep them coming. So yeah. Have you seen the Beyond Paradigm podcast with putoff and

47:51.040 --> 47:55.520
graves? Do you think that it's important that somebody who just worked with putoff just testified?

47:55.520 --> 47:59.680
I have not seen the podcast with putoff and graves. Have you? I would like to watch it though,

48:00.240 --> 48:05.680
because we've got to meet Ryan Graves as well, and he's extremely kind. What's the chatter with

48:05.680 --> 48:12.560
the grush op-ed? Well, Burleson will make some comments on it, but he thought the reason as to

48:12.560 --> 48:18.480
why the American public has not seen it yet was not his place to say, but he did have some comments

48:18.480 --> 48:25.680
on it, which is pretty interesting. Okay, perfect. Thank you for putting the question. How was the

48:25.680 --> 48:30.160
UAPDF dinner? Any key points there that caught your attention? Did congressional individuals and

48:30.160 --> 48:36.720
staffer show interest? Thank you. That's a perfect segue question. So Lester Nair, guys, if you guys,

48:36.720 --> 48:42.000
you guys probably all know Lester Nair. If you don't, I'd really follow him. He's a member of UAP

48:42.000 --> 48:47.120
Caucus, brilliant individual. This morning he tweeted, I have a lot of thoughts about yesterday.

48:47.120 --> 48:51.200
I'll just start with saying being here in person is like seeing the situation in full color,

48:51.840 --> 48:55.600
watching only the hearings and not all the things happening in real life before and

48:55.600 --> 49:01.120
after around it. It's like watching it in black and white. And this is a statement we've talked

49:01.120 --> 49:05.920
about. I couldn't agree more with guys. The hearings were good. I love the time there,

49:05.920 --> 49:16.080
but I was blown away by UAPDF. Seeing the House and congressional interest and support from both

49:16.080 --> 49:22.240
Republicans and Democrats, seeing the unity around some individuals, seeing members connected

49:22.240 --> 49:26.960
with the intelligence community. There were numerous staffers as well that we just talked about that

49:27.600 --> 49:32.640
Kermit and I connected with a lot of business cards to speak to staffers who are really

49:32.640 --> 49:39.200
interested in the subject. And I'll keep going on, but give me your thoughts on UAPDF.

49:39.200 --> 49:45.040
Yeah. First off, I just want to say Lester Nair, thank you kindly for letting us in.

49:45.680 --> 49:51.600
It was extraordinary just to be able to just be amongst everybody and just have the opportunity

49:51.600 --> 49:56.960
just to be able to attend and get to talk to everybody. Yeah. I mean, pretty much a lot

49:56.960 --> 50:00.400
of the witnesses were there. A lot of people around them, Ryan Graves, who attended the

50:00.400 --> 50:05.680
hearings and was also at the UAPDF. And then some of the representatives, Senator Rounds,

50:05.680 --> 50:11.120
gave the opening address and actually awarded Lou Elizondo a framed copy of the legislation

50:11.120 --> 50:17.760
that was cool to the NDAA last year, which I think that that speaks volumes to the support and

50:17.760 --> 50:24.160
just the persistence, just kind of the persistence that Senator Rounds and these people in Congress

50:24.160 --> 50:29.680
have about really trying to get transparency and enacting legislation to get that. And none of them

50:29.680 --> 50:36.560
are like, like none of them are kooky or dubious characters as Green Street would say. Burrelson

50:36.560 --> 50:41.280
went on stage. He said, guys, like I've said this before, I'll say it again. I'm skeptic about

50:41.280 --> 50:47.760
everything. But there's obvious blockages here from places outside of Congress. And I want to

50:47.760 --> 50:52.080
get to the bottom of this and so forth. So these guys are all saying that they don't have all the

50:52.080 --> 50:58.000
pieces, but they're pretty darn open-minded. We'll just say Burrelson has not been at rest

50:58.000 --> 51:03.920
since Brush spoke last year. He has not been just relaxing and chilling. Either has Birchette

51:04.560 --> 51:10.480
and other people. We got the board of directors for the UAP-DF, including Gary Nolan, Nell and

51:10.480 --> 51:16.720
Elizondo, the advisory board, Timothy Gallaudet, Chris Mellon, Kirk McConnell. Interesting about

51:16.720 --> 51:22.320
Chris Mellon. We went to the art museum today and the Mellon family donated all of the best

51:22.320 --> 51:28.240
pieces there. Substantially all, yeah. And we got a document here, an actual picture of the six

51:28.240 --> 51:35.120
observables of UAP craft, including positive lift, hypersonic velocities, instantaneous acceleration,

51:35.120 --> 51:40.400
low observability, trans-medium travel and biological effects. But what I would just like

51:40.400 --> 51:44.480
to say about the UAP-DF is there were some individuals there that I have wanted to connect to

51:44.480 --> 51:52.400
for a very long time that I finally got the chance to sit and speak with. And I couldn't be happier.

51:52.400 --> 51:56.160
So do we want to talk about, I guess, our conversation with Leslie?

51:56.240 --> 51:58.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll talk about Leslie Kane a little bit.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How was that conversation?

52:00.720 --> 52:07.760
So for the Brad Swarinson ARV project, analyzing emails and transcripts, I found one mention

52:07.760 --> 52:14.080
that between 2000 and 2003, Mark had sent Leslie Kane a copy of Fluxliner as drawn by Brad.

52:14.880 --> 52:20.000
And so I bring this up to Leslie Kane and she couldn't remember it because at that time she

52:20.000 --> 52:26.560
was working with Greer. She didn't talk to McCandlishe after 2004 when she left with Greer,

52:26.560 --> 52:31.840
didn't know all about that. And so asked me to explain. And Leslie Kane kind of had no idea of

52:31.840 --> 52:36.880
the Brad Swarinson interview with Aviation Week in Space Technology. And so Shera and I were

52:36.880 --> 52:42.480
talking for like 10 minutes straight. She was gobsmacked about the death threats from Swarinson.

52:42.480 --> 52:46.480
She couldn't believe it. But then she and I were talking about that. We were talking about the

52:46.480 --> 52:52.800
Edwards case and Wittness Ed, Kexburg as well. And Leslie Kane is just one of the smartest,

52:52.800 --> 52:58.080
nicest people I've ever spoken to. There was a group of journalists nearby. I sat near them at

52:58.080 --> 53:02.480
the press conference and they were kind of hounding around, really nice people kind of

53:02.480 --> 53:06.400
wanting to get a picture of what was going on. So then afterwards they talked to me for like 30

53:06.400 --> 53:12.720
minutes on how I source methods. But Leslie Kane was so cool to talk to. She's so small and she's

53:12.720 --> 53:17.520
so cute with her like, gray hair that's puffing out in every direction. It was, it was really

53:17.520 --> 53:23.600
fantastic just watching y'all both just go and add it on Kexburg and Torrance and it was just,

53:23.600 --> 53:27.280
it was like a meeting of the minds and I was just like, I was just blessed just to like sit and watch

53:27.280 --> 53:32.000
it, you know? Because she stepped away from the case for a while. I think with, I think with a lot

53:32.000 --> 53:37.120
of journalists, and it makes sense, right? When you have to, you know, meet a quota for maybe a

53:37.120 --> 53:41.280
publication or some forth, at some point, you got to step away from the case. Yeah. And so with

53:41.280 --> 53:45.840
Kexburg, you know, Kexburg, I think she hit a dead end, which I understand too, because I also told

53:45.840 --> 53:51.120
her about kind of Romansky and some of the FOIA dead ends with talking to his kids who he mentioned

53:51.120 --> 53:59.360
on the Jim Montell show, words of night access to, or told not to speak about Romansky. So in my

53:59.360 --> 54:03.760
opinion, Kexburg has hit someone of a dead end, but, you know, her eyes kind of lit up when I told

54:03.760 --> 54:08.640
her about the Sorens and stuff, because, you know, that case really is alive and well, especially

54:08.640 --> 54:13.680
with ARV and Immaculate Constellation. But yeah, I mean, it's made the new cycle yet again. And as

54:13.680 --> 54:20.240
we know, this, the, the McCandler Sorens and Story is one of the original like sources of the ARV

54:20.240 --> 54:25.600
reproduction vehicle concept. So, you know, if we, if, if we really want to understand the

54:25.600 --> 54:31.040
ARV and the RV, man, like we need to, we need to, we need, I don't know, we need to drag people in

54:31.040 --> 54:36.480
and start getting them testified. Well, and I really need to stress this, because I think Corbell

54:36.480 --> 54:42.320
and Knapp discussed this as well as some others. The term, excuse me, ARV did not originate with

54:42.320 --> 54:49.200
Greer. This UFO researcher, Bill Hamilton was the first person to ever speak about ARV. And this

54:49.200 --> 54:55.520
term was given to him by Brad and Bill Scott. And in 1991, he was the first one to publish

54:55.520 --> 55:00.560
the term ARV to text unrelated to the story. I think he made a misprint here. He called it an

55:00.560 --> 55:05.760
alien replicated vehicle, not alien reproduction vehicle, but use the term ARV. And so in my tweet

55:05.760 --> 55:09.120
where I kind of called out Schellenberger a little bit for saying, Hey, why did you take this out?

55:09.120 --> 55:15.440
It's because ARV is not attributing alien and extra terrestrials to this vehicle. ARV is the

55:15.440 --> 55:20.400
specific term. It's like the brand name, like Sprite to lemon line soda that Brad Sorensen was

55:20.400 --> 55:24.480
told by the individual showing off the craft at Northern Air Force Base, which is a story, I

55:24.480 --> 55:30.400
believe to be true. ARV specifically was said, these are alien reproduction vehicles. So, you know,

55:30.400 --> 55:34.560
by saying alien reproduction vehicle, it's not just extraterrestrial. It's a, I hate to use this

55:34.640 --> 55:40.080
word because I think it's overused, but it is a kind of a nuance term, right? Yeah. But so Leslie

55:40.080 --> 55:46.160
Kane, I'm sending her some of the ARV stuff and she and I are going to get cracking and talk a

55:46.160 --> 55:50.400
little bit more about that. So it's exciting. If I could get her on the show or talk to her,

55:50.400 --> 55:53.600
because we were waiting for like 20 minutes to speak to her. There were some

55:54.400 --> 55:59.840
chatty Cathy speaking to her right before we got up. And it's okay. I mean, for some

56:00.800 --> 56:06.160
people like us, it's, it's a little shocking to be in kind of a mixture with

56:07.040 --> 56:11.920
some of the people we were around. Yeah, I would say overall, it just felt very surreal. I mean,

56:11.920 --> 56:15.840
for me, you know, this is, I guess the first time I've come out and like, Hey, I'm Kermit,

56:15.840 --> 56:20.400
I'm probably probably about years or whatever. And then also just seeing a lot of people that

56:20.400 --> 56:25.760
have been like following and talking with like on Twitter, Reddit, you know, all these different

56:25.840 --> 56:30.400
social media platforms and then seeing a lot of those people in person. And then like,

56:30.400 --> 56:34.800
you know, the UAPDF party, it's like, you know, who are kind of worried if we weren't, if we're

56:34.800 --> 56:38.960
going to get in or not, it was all this, you know, kind of anxiety about it. And then just being in

56:38.960 --> 56:43.040
the room, it was like, at first part, I was just like anxious because I'm like, geez, like, I'm so

56:43.040 --> 56:49.680
out of place. But I also just felt like just so happy and just so blessed just to like have, have

56:49.680 --> 56:54.320
that experience. Everybody there was brilliant. Everybody there had something to offer and talk

56:54.320 --> 56:59.440
about. And it was just a really special group of people. It was really darn cool. Absolutely.

56:59.440 --> 57:03.520
And it was really cool. I also, we got to talk to James Fox quite a bit as well.

57:04.240 --> 57:08.080
Really excited for the program. We're going to see that next week at Sol. But

57:08.080 --> 57:14.400
James Fox is one cool dude out on Apple TV, November, December 15. I think so. He is one

57:14.400 --> 57:19.920
cool dude guys. James Fox is awesome to talk to. Yep. We were, yeah, we, we talked a lot about

57:20.560 --> 57:27.120
that. And then also just going to Sol and, you know, just his doc, like his, his work with Virginia

57:27.120 --> 57:33.040
a little bit as well. So fantastic guy. I would say a lot of the people that we met yesterday

57:33.040 --> 57:38.480
were very nice. You know, they're very interested in talking to us and learning from our perspective

57:38.480 --> 57:43.280
and our experience and kind of like, you know, our reason, our why of like being this topic. So

57:43.280 --> 57:47.440
I found it pretty cool because I find as like a content creator in the sphere, there's a lot of

57:47.680 --> 57:51.840
like hoarding of information, I would say, and kind of unwillingness to share and collaborate.

57:51.840 --> 57:57.680
So being around this group of people who are just so willing to speak and talk was, was really

57:57.680 --> 58:01.520
cool. You know, so many people asked me like, who do I work for? They say nobody. I, you know,

58:01.520 --> 58:06.000
I work for myself. I'm just here because I'm intellectually curious about aliens. Yeah.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.640
Some people would kind of give a look at like, really? Yeah. Like Burlton asked me that and I

58:10.640 --> 58:16.000
just know like I'm self published. I just create documentaries. And so that was, that was really

58:16.000 --> 58:21.600
cool guys. I'm on a first name basis with Rhett Burlton. Did you notice the witnesses were as

58:21.600 --> 58:25.200
nervous in person as they appeared on TV? I understand it's a nerve wracking situation,

58:25.200 --> 58:30.000
but they seem very nervous. To me, they did not look nervous at all. The most nervous person was

58:30.000 --> 58:36.560
Jeremy Cordell. I wasn't in the room. So I wouldn't know. I will say, I mean, they didn't seem nervous

58:36.560 --> 58:41.360
at least when I got to meet a lot of them at the UAPDF. You know, if these people are all engaged

58:41.440 --> 58:46.240
in some massive psychological operation, they're doing a really, really good job of it. Because

58:46.240 --> 58:50.160
it did not seem like they were engaged in fraud or anything like that. And I think Michael Gold

58:50.160 --> 58:55.200
had one heck of a time because he was a, he was just kind of eating candy the whole time. And

58:55.200 --> 59:01.600
then afterwards I got to speak to him and he was just so, he was like all smiles that he got to

59:01.600 --> 59:08.080
talk. So, you know, it's always nice meeting the men behind the mics and talking to these people.

59:08.080 --> 59:14.240
Well, I mean, there's certainly, I had been a little harsh, I think, on loot lately with some of

59:14.240 --> 59:20.560
the presentation stuff and just sort of the questions that still remain and are really

59:20.560 --> 59:25.200
valid about his background, as well as his work at CIFA, the Counterintelligence Field Activity.

59:25.200 --> 59:33.040
But, you know, meeting and talking to these people was really great. So, yes, okay.

59:33.040 --> 59:38.000
While this part was people reporting loss of time and feelings of unease, let's remember the story

59:38.000 --> 59:42.880
of Jonathan Wagan, who in 1997 in Peru, when he and his fellow Marines allegedly found a crash

59:42.880 --> 59:48.960
saucer as they got within close proximity, they felt like intense fear and unease. And, you know,

59:48.960 --> 59:53.120
if the infographics whistleblower story is true, crash retrieval operators have to have

59:53.120 --> 59:59.360
grounding mechanisms because your cognition is so affected. Well, it's a, yeah, I've heard from

59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.920
other people's experiences as well that loss of time is actually quite common. I think there's

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.640
something to do with the warping of gravity and time and just how that affects our perception.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.440
That definitely tracks. There's another point I was going to say to that, but I'm completely

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:20.320
blanking on it. Is it about fear or? Fear. Oh, actually, what I was going to say is, you know,

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.040
actually, the loss of time is also featured in the X-Files, too. Whenever Fox Motor, whenever he has

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.200
these encounters, if you see his, you know, extraterrestrial vehicle, he'll check his

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.200
watch because he's trying to see if the, you know, the timer's gone. So I don't know. I, I, I

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.880
sort of watched the X-Files after I really started getting into UAPs and I'm like,

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.200
interesting. Like, this is talking, this is a lot of the stuff I've been like researching it.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.160
This is a little on the nose. X-Files is a big thing. What's going on?

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.960
And I'll talk about one very specific thing in the X-Files in my next video. How much of the

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.320
UAP topic occupies your daily life researching, editing? If I'm not with the girlfriend talking

01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:00.960
to Kermit on the phone, training Jiu Jitsu, lifting weights or doing other work, I'm doing this. So

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:07.760
and I know you didn't ask me, but what I will say is it's probably, it is my, it is my intellectual

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.640
curiosity. So after, after work, after dinner, after I'm done hanging out with my friends and

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:21.120
watching Instagram reels, I'm scrolling the CIA's reading room and the Navy's reading room as well.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:28.320
Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I'll say if I'm not, this takes up probably most of my time outside the

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.080
lady. I always have like nine or 10 PDFs. I'm reading escape velocity. Thank you so much.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.720
This is for our, oh, thank you. Let's catch up soon. Absolutely. Thank you so much.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.280
I appreciate it, man. I appreciate it a lot. And yes, sorry I missed your call today. It's been

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:50.560
hectic as been very hectic, dude, but thank you so much. Levi, it was nice to meet you too, man.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.760
Wanted to ask if you got any impressions hearing roundspeak at the UAPDA would be

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.520
reintroduced independently. I wouldn't be surprised. He mentioned it a couple of times.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.920
There seems to be very strong support. Yeah.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.120
To reintroduce seems to be a little bit of spite that it wasn't passed.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.240
Yeah. He seemed pretty unhappy. So it was mentioned a lot.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:14.560
So Juan, thank you again, dude. Holy cow. Do you believe SSCI know some UAPs are NHI and are aware

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:22.320
of the legacy program? Senate probably. Yeah. Senate probably. Especially

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.880
House, I think like a house is really still trying to get answers on this. But as far as we know,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.360
Senate has been on this trail. Like they had almost a year, a six months to a year head start

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.160
over the house and their investigations. Yeah. That's at least what I was told.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.040
Okay. This is a good question. What alleged NHI technology would you both like to most know

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:51.840
everything about things? I would like, I don't, that's actually a tough one. I've grappled with

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.880
this question a lot. So I'll let you go first, Grimmit. You just throw me the. Yeah, you go first, man.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.920
I want to, I think the electrogravity is probably the first thing I want to look at.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.280
I want to, I just, I just want to know like if it was actually a thing, you know, also just by the

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:15.280
way, like, come on. So the B2, I don't know if you guys know this, but the B2 has a technology on

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.960
board. I think it's called the inertial mass reduction or something like that. Basically,

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.560
it uses like electromagnetic, like high voltage electricity through the wings to reduce the

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.840
weight of the airframe. So it's like less, less, less heavy in the air. So it's a little bit more

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.880
maneuverable. I just think that's very interesting, you know, up to I think, and that's basically

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.840
electrogravity. If you want to, if you want to kind of think about it like that. I mean,

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.880
I'm not a scientist. Again, I'm going to count it. But that's probably one of the first things I

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:48.000
would be interested in. I'd say novel propulsion and then energy would be the next one. Like how,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.640
how is that propulsion like being energized? That's kind of one and two for me.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:58.560
So specific technology, because I can't really go with the craft, I would like to know

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.600
about the piece of technology that RA described that was the weapons technology.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.560
The tablet?

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.320
Yes. That was showing the symbology. He didn't know if it was in his head or not.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.280
So that, that would, that would be one of mine.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.120
Sorry. Sorry, getting through these and I'm going through. Thank you. Will be Milo. Pretty

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.960
impressive. You are pretty impressive. Thank you so much. And so one again. Thank you, dude. Holy

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.280
cow. And Chris Sharp collab would go insane. Well, you know, Chris Sharp wasn't there,

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.160
but I got to make a heck of a lot of connections. So I would love to talk crash retrievals with

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.680
Sharp. In fact, you know, I'd like to meet him in person. So, you know, maybe we'll get a London

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:48.000
trip going in because I'd really like to meet him. UAP is across the pond. So JC was not testifying.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.200
That is an interesting observation. Why would he be nervous? I don't know, but he just, when I was

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.200
talking to him before the hearings, he was just like, okay, now I need to center myself a little bit.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.680
So. Oh, okay. I just, I didn't, I didn't know what JC was at first.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:07.200
Did you talk with anyone about remote viewing? Yeah, quite a bit. Specifically, Chris from

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:14.160
Area 52 channel. He was with, he's really cool, by the way. You got to talk to him too from Area 52.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.640
He actually says he has had experience with remote viewing. So I'm going to link up and talk with him

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.520
and, you know, see if he can do some, some sort of demonstrations or proof of concept because,

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.520
you know, I'm sure you feel kind of the same, same way as me, but this is one of the toughest

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.520
things for me to grab my head around and grapple just because I'm so unfamiliar with the topic.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.960
Yeah. The only time it was really discussed was kind of talking about like Ed May's work in the

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.280
1990s and how that got transferred into that certain private corporation that we're interested in.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.480
Was it Mays or Luna that also talked about craft flown with mind?

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.880
Bind body. That was craft connection. Luna, I think was mind body. She said it was a mind

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.680
body connection. That was interesting. That was very interesting. Okay. This is just a comment.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.840
Diana Posolka said on a pod, Tim Taylor, AKA Tyler told her ex files had real consultants from the

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:06.720
program. Yep. Yeah. I would agree. I would agree with this. Holy crap. Snapple. Thank you so much.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.320
BJJ practitioners. Where do you train? I mean, that is just so kind of you. Thank you. I'll be

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:18.560
sharing this loop with my boy Kermit here. Thank you so much. Sorry. I'm just looking at, okay,

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.720
questions. Yes. Thank you guys. What actions moving forward? Are you guys looking for Congress to

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.200
take and what would indicate action on the information to discuss discussed in this hearing?

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.080
That's a great question. For me specifically, what actions moving forward? Witnesses need to

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.520
be subpoenaed and this needs to be done in a setting outside of Arrow. I spoke with Burleson

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.560
about this and there are witnesses. I have talked about publicly and not publicly that

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:51.840
information has been passed on for him to get subpoenaed. Yeah. I feel like the more interesting

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.600
people to talk to at this point are the ones that are not going to be super cooperative because

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.280
I think the majority of them are probably a little bit more in the know than people that

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:05.120
are more transparent about this. That's just my take on this. I also want to see Congress

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:11.360
actually investigating the forensic audit trail. I want them either getting a GAO audit done,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:17.920
a DOGE audit, this Department of Government Efficiency stuff. I want them to start making

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.680
progress on figuring out how the funding is happening and if there's taxpayer dollars or

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.320
private money that's involved because I think ultimately that's I think the American people

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.880
deserve to know and the Congress people themselves said it multiple times like we are going to find

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:38.080
out about this. That's something I want them desperately to follow up on. I think this is

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.880
a good question. Why do you think we haven't seen any new evidence like videos or pics?

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.240
Of course, you could reference why a lot of people I think are kind of disappointed there

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.880
wasn't such evidence shown at the hearings. However, I think the info here is a little bit

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.320
more complicated because if we're talking about immaculate constellation, for example, and

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.080
some of the imagery there, Kermit talked about this earlier, but it's not like a satellite

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:06.480
feeds are giving you a steady 4K recording picture. No, you're giving data. You're just

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:13.120
giving streams of data and I think anomalies are noticed in the data for objects in picture or

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.680
there's various conditions to kind of identify what the satellite systems for NRO and NGA and

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.960
stuff are looking at. At this point, this data is filtered and if it's picked up by immaculate

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.400
constellation and so forth, it's siloed away quickly. Another thing I'll add as well is like

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.200
if you're just looking at ARRO and you're looking at the progress that ARRO has made,

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.040
by the way, they just released a new report, a historical records report, where they talked

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.480
about some of the new cases and morphology and the progress that ARRO has been making.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.560
I like the report. I'm curious to know what the chat's thoughts are this evening about that as

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:53.040
well, but what I will say is ARRO has indicated they are building more instrument platforms and so

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.840
I think as they're starting to build, I think it was called the Gremlin system, which is like

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.600
hyper spectral imagery. As these offices and as other organizations start to

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.080
parse that data and they start to look at that and they can take intelligence from it,

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.360
they can scrub it to make sure there's no classified information, I think we're going to

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.520
start to see that going forward, but I think it's really just been the instruments, the technology

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.760
to see this stuff, it's just had to catch up recently. And then somebody asked the question

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:28.240
and you relate it, which is a good question. If Sean Kirkpatrick saw no, thought all UAP was

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.800
prosaic, why have these Gremlin systems and advanced sensory data have been introduced?

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.560
That was a random question from a random person on Twitter, but I thought it was a very, very

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.880
good question because it's like Kirkpatrick, when he was running ARRO, he had the main line

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:49.040
narrative of most, if not all UAP are prosaic, the people that are witnesses are either misinformed

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.280
or they're providing disinformation to Congress for their own financial benefit, whatever.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.640
But at the same breath, it's like, okay, Kirkpatrick, you're saying UFOs aren't real,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.760
but you're spending a bunch of money on cameras that can look at things that aren't visible to the

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.240
human eye. Why? And speaking of Kirkpatrick, I thought it was mighty funny to see Tim

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.880
go after Kirkpatrick in both his testimony and congressional submission and Kirkpatrick

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.840
kind of fire back like it was a high school drama. He's just mad, I didn't hire him.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.360
Kirkpatrick is so hot under the collar. I'm sure everybody here has seen his

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.560
interview on Event Horizon. Kirkpatrick is just, he never makes himself look good.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.920
Well, let's not forget his LinkedIn letter after the Grush hearing that posted the same

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.160
day after the multi-date Grush. He was so petty with Grush. Yeah.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.000
So Area 52 has been going over the 4chan leak from last year. Very interesting stuff. What are

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.800
your thoughts on it? My thoughts are I plan to make a full video about it because there's just

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:55.280
a lot of interesting tidbits. The 4chan leaker? Yeah, the 4chan leaker, if nobody knows, it's

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:01.040
an alleged testimony off of 4chan, which of course is going to raise some red flags because

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.960
4chan is kind of just a place for a lot of self-deprecating funny people to post about

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.240
wild stuff. But the theory behind this is that there's basically a hamburger-shaped

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.760
self-replicating craft that patrols our ocean non-human that custom builds UAP for specific

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:23.120
mission purposes. And this is part of the reason that crash is occurring, thus retrievals, because

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.000
this specific facility generally doesn't care what happens to its used up product.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.560
Well, it's because the UFOs that are coming from this area, whatever this craft is,

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:41.520
they seem to be just built for spec, built for that mission. And so it's almost disposable,

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.360
right? So sometimes these things aren't perfectly built. They crash and then we pick it up.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.600
My take on it is that that story is very interesting and it sounds like something the

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.200
United States maybe would be very interested in doing, but I'll say no more.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So William says, do you think it will be different on the issues of UFOs now that

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.880
Trump is president? Absolutely. I personally do. Just because I think part of it he has

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.400
spoken about UFOs openly, so I think he'll be more receptive and reporters and media will be more

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.680
interested to ask him. And I think with some of the people he's positioned in power might be

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.120
far more willing to work with him. We'll see how Marco Rubio works with Trump. Trump used to

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.120
call him Little Marco. Yeah, but I feel like that was a lot of just political

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.280
swagger. He's just trying to beat Rubio on the election. I don't think he holds that against him.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:42.640
He's just teasing him, I don't know. But I will say Trump has indicated that he's not only interested

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.920
in getting disclosure about UAPs, but also like the JFK records, 9-11, all these other

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.960
issues and things that we've been talking about in terms of improper government oversight or

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:59.040
possible malfeasance. He wants truth on not just UAPs, just like truth in general. I think that

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.680
that's a good idea of what we're going to see the next four years. So Shardful, what are your

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.320
thoughts on Boebert talking about the rumors on the Hill about DoD involved in genetic manipulation?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.600
Interesting. First of all, I thought her line of speaking,

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.280
like I understand a lot of people right after election want to bring some

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.160
political jargon into something, but I thought her talking about the last election and so forth

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.800
was a little bit of a poor taste. It's already difficult to get the subject taken seriously.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.120
So you want questions as directed and purposeful as possible, talking about birds being drones.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.000
Birds aren't real. Yeah, when you say that, it's just you're making it disingenuous and it

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.080
honestly felt like the lines of questioning prior to Boebert taking the stage. It was very

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.440
good. It was leading somewhere. There were some very interesting things and then all of a sudden

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.160
Boebert gets up and is like birds aren't real and Biden got 81 million votes and it felt for a brief

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.160
moment like the air was sucked out and the energy was sucked out for a minute.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.280
Maybe there is some interesting research to be done about genetic manipulation,

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.640
but now that she said that, that's associated with conspiracies like birds.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:13.200
Yeah, but it makes you wonder like, okay, Boebert is at least aware of this, but is the other part

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.560
of the UAP caucus like as Burleson, as Birchhead, as Moskowitz, as Luna, the guys that we know on

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.200
the Hill that are interested in this, are they also hearing about this too? Because I know Colt's

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.800
heart, he speculated on his live stream. I don't know the speculation, but kind of saying like,

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.400
watch this space a little bit because it seems that there are possibly credible allegations

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.760
about a hybridization program that have reached Congress and that might be something that will

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.920
be talked about in further hearings. I think GS15 John Ramirez has talked about that on public

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.520
forums as well. I can't quite remember, but Truthsau says, who specifically would use a

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.960
peanut to testify? One, Ed from Edwards. Two and three, I can't necessarily say. What about you,

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:57.520
Kermit?

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.600
Probably Deputy Secretary David Turk of the Department of Energy.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.520
Oh, we walked by the DOE today. We did walk by the Forest Hall building.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.200
We took pictures outside the James Forest Hall Department of Energy building to make chat.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:20.320
It was a great time. Yeah, I would subpoena. Definitely, without naming names, some folks

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:28.640
in the Air Force that oversee experimental test wings at Edwards and the Deputy Director of,

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.920
sorry, the Director of Global Acts, Office of Global Acts. Those are my top three.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:39.120
Or, thank you so much for the 50s. This is for my boys, 10 and 12. Well, thank you. That's

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.160
extremely nice. Role model and inspiration, thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.120
and also extend those same courtesy to Kermit because he is killing it. You're getting a lot

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:55.040
of love on this show too, man. Thank you so much. Falcon, Ed, do you think Avi Loeb is an ally or not?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:02.720
Yes, I have a friend who speaks extremely highly of Avi and are trying to maybe facilitate a meeting

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.240
with himself and me. I'd really like to talk to him. Do you have any thoughts on Avi?

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:14.880
I think he's doing a really, really good thing. I think it's so great that the same

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.800
organization that John Mack was a part of and there was a lot of issues with his internal review.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:27.200
Now, Harvard is kind of supporting Avi Loeb having a more serious inquiry into the major

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:35.680
light craft. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just saying, generally, just looking at how

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.040
Harvard treats their staff is they're a little bit more open to Avi having this discussion

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:47.680
versus how they were with Mack decades ago. This is my take. Yeah, I think very highly of Avi.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.800
Remember when James Clapper lied about mass surveillance to the Congress and nothing happened?

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.640
Yes. It seems like that's talked about quite a lot. They lie about a bunch of stuff.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Okay. Sorry, guys. Just looking for some questions. The chat here is always excellent.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.720
That's why I'm trying to look specifically for questions.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.680
Yeah, they're awesome.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.840
Just because there's a lot of good discussion. Carl Nell and Admiral Wilson. Yeah, that's another.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.000
Oh, what do I think of the work Jesse Michaels is doing? I think Jesse is fantastic and he's one

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.560
of the best voices in the space. I've got to grow to be friends with him over the last couple of

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.240
months and, of course, hang out with him in person. Jesse is wonderful and he is really,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:41.280
really driven to make change in this field. He is a very solid person. Jesse's just got his

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.640
own style too, man. We talked about this earlier, but nobody else could show up to the hearings

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.880
in just like a more laxed fit. If anybody did it, but Jesse, they would look a bit strange.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.680
I think we're towards the end now. Keep submitting those questions. Otherwise,

01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.480
we'll just keep chatting about the Immaculate Constellation Report, which we'll get into.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:06.000
You'd go with the DOE people too and former CA, Office of Global Access. Yeah, Gaffney would be

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.920
good. However, I think the names from Wilson Davis, the senior review group, and specifically would

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:16.240
be very good. I would subpoena the sec depths from the 90s. I think Terry was one of them that was

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:22.240
talked about who might have had purview because I think he was undersecretary of research and

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.120
development for DODs, so he would have probably had purview in the early 90s, late 80s.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.880
So we're at a little bit of a good point in the questions now. You want to talk a little bit about

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:41.120
the Immaculate Constellation Report? Absolutely. There's one report that you have been mulling

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.920
over in your head a lot. Can you tell us about that case? Absolutely. There's the iPad. We got it

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.520
up right there. So for those of you guys following at home, we're talking about specifically the

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.040
cases in Section 2, the US government imagery intelligence. Let me pull up a second screen.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:01.920
How about that? Okay. And while we do that, I can have it right here. Okay, we got Max Farr.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.840
Thank you, Max. Max Farr is a good friend of both of us. How's it going, sir? Yeah,

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.560
now that we have ARBs mentioned in Immaculate Constellation, the time is nigh. I got to say I

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:16.720
am thrilled that the term ARB is fully in the report. I think that's excellent.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:25.680
Yeah, just quickly read it. So something that, you know, just reading all these different reports

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.080
and the examples of just the imagery intelligence that's included within the database of Immaculate

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.120
Constellation, I'll say a lot of these reports are very interesting and eye-opening, but there's

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.960
one that I'm very interested to see if we can get either a FOIA request or like any sort of follow-up

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.400
on this because this would seem like a crazy video. Okay, let me just read the description.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.040
On U.S. government networks, there exists OPIR footage of a large saucer-shaped UAP emerging

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:56.720
from within a dense cloud formation. The saucer registered black-hot against white-cold with

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.960
atmospheric disturbances caused by the saucer-shaped UAP visible. The saucer was between 200 to 400

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.000
meters in circumference and displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface, so I think like

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.640
a dome on top. After breaking above the cloud cover, the saucer-shaped UAP suddenly reverses its

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.760
direction, descending partially back into the cloud cover, then accelerating rapidly out of frame

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:25.200
and partially obscured by the cloud tops. This behavior was evasive in nature and implied that

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:30.960
the saucer-shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space-based collection

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:36.160
platform. Now, when I read that, I'm like, it's just like, I'm picturing this and, you know,

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.440
I'm kind of thinking about the movie NOPE, which was by Jordan Peele. Jordan Peele, and it's a,

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.520
you know, horror movie with like an alien vehicle that's like living and it eats people whatever.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.000
But the common theme of that movie is like, you know, it's in a cloud. It's this white vehicle

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.840
that's like in this cloud. And as I'm like picturing it, I can almost see it as just this

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:01.120
giant saucer. It's like coming in and out of the clouds. And it's, you know, as we also talk about,

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:07.680
you know, reporting and trying to identify UAP, it seems that these things are either manipulating

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:13.040
or, you know, changing their kind of imagery or like how they present themselves so that

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.600
we're not aware of them or they're just trying to conceal their nature. So like this disc flying

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.560
like in the clouds because it doesn't want to be seen by a satellite, like that's kind of crazy.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:28.240
That's kind of crazy. And then further, like what is the, I guess, what is the, what's the video

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:31.760
here? Is this like a video from the ground, from a helicopter? Yeah, from ground or a satellite

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.480
imagery. I don't know. But I think that that would be a very interesting video to get out in the

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:44.160
public. Now, can you tell us about the Indo-Pacific mention where ARV is mentioned, please? Yes,

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.320
yes, yes. So talking about foreign reproduction vehicles, on U.S. government networks, there

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.040
exists infrared footage of an imagery of a grouping of vessels engaged in SIGINT,

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:59.360
Signals Intelligence, and MASSINT, which is Measurement and Measurement Intelligence.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.800
I believe so. Keep reading that. I know we looked this up. SIGINT and MASSINT collection at night

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.920
in a specific area of the Pacific Ocean, not naming names. In this footage, which was in

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:16.640
close proximity to the vessels, a large equilateral triangle UAP suddenly appears directly over the

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.120
ships. The three bright points are seen at each bottom corner of the UAP, which is observed to

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.480
slowly rotate on its horizontal axis. This rotation partially revealed a horizontal bar of

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:33.680
sweeping lights. Intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:38.640
triangle is a reproduction vehicle and concludes that the vessels must have been made aware of

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.680
the ARV's frequent use of these coordinates due to foreign pre-positioning of advanced

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.800
collection assets at the exact time and place. After a brief period of hovering and slowly

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:55.440
rotating approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean, the ARV suddenly disappears and the

01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:04.160
footage ends. Just ominous. Again, we've heard from individuals, Elizondo whistleblowers,

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.560
that there are videos and images that exist on U.S. government networks, but a lot of these

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:17.920
videos, especially in this case, this was taken in what we would call a denied area. This is a

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.320
intelligence surveillance platform that we have in a foreign area that we're using to collect

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:29.040
intelligence on our foreign adversaries and others. Releasing that publicly would be a little bit

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:36.720
little bit controversial. First, we have the equilateral triangle UAP, but then also potentially

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.680
we might be doxing another country's legacy program. This would be China in this instance,

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.880
based on the relative proximity, which this is one of the greatest questions. China and Russia

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:56.000
are our adversaries as discussed by some people like David Grush. How much success have they

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.960
made in their legacy programs? Grush has said we're in a decades-long Cold War with our adversaries.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:10.240
Did they rip off a TRF 3B triangle? It's really, really interesting. I find it interesting that

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.080
the term ARB slash RV is used too. It's not just Alien Reproduction Vehicle, but also

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.560
Reproduction Vehicle. I'm happy that distinction was made because Reproduction Vehicle could just

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:27.120
mean a reverse engineer to make jet or something. Forgive me for speculating here on the live stream,

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:32.720
but what if Alien Reproduction Vehicle and Reproduction Vehicle kind of leaves out the

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.000
possibility that we have Reproduction Vehicles that we wouldn't necessarily call Alien. In the

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.600
sense of there's potentially objects that are coming extraterrestrially, which we would consider

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.080
general or traditional aliens. Or is there stuff that's coming interdimensional or within our oceans

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:56.320
or some coming in and out of our existence? We could call that Alien or we could call it something

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.400
else. But at the end of the day, what we're trying to copy, it's a reproduction vehicle.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:09.280
I thought this instance was interesting as well due to just one sentence. So,

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:16.160
Southcom tic-tac detected by space asset in proximity a vessel. On USG networks, there exists

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:22.240
OPIR imagery of massent of a tic-tac UAP transmitting through an area of the Atlantic Ocean.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:27.760
The tic-tac maneuvers had an altitude at or near local cloud coverage and correlated electromagnetic

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.640
signatures were collected by massent. In the available footage, the tic-tac UAP transits

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.880
rapidly through the field of regard as it transits the ocean. No observation reaction is seen to come

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:44.240
from the vessel, but its proximity in space and in time and space to the trajectory of this UAP

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.320
suggests foreknowledge of the UAP event by intelligence. So, what's interesting to me

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.840
that there is so Magnetic Constellation is just kind of accessing these intelligence databases to

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.520
collect records and so forth. So, who is the intelligence organization behind shooting this

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:07.040
video if they had forewarned knowledge of this UAP incursion event and thus were kind of predicting

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.240
its movements? Would this be a satellite system? I don't think it's too far of a stretch to think

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.520
some of these sightings may be conducted by NRO and NGA, gruscious positions who have

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.520
satellite systems that actually can detect and track some of these vehicles. Yeah, and just knowing

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.960
how just, I mean, I've never worked in government or military intelligence, but just briefly how

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.680
that kind of works is, I think that they're trying to get multiple signatures of the same

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:37.600
object. It's one thing just to get a satellite, but then also like ground sensor, camera, underwater

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:44.640
sensor, a second kind of corroborative source to verify if this thing is existing, it's real.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.960
They're tracking it usually on more than one kind of instrument. And let's talk a little bit about

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:56.000
the morphologies, right? So, we're using a data set from 1991 to 2002. I'd just like to talk about

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.640
the morphologies just because it's so interesting. Within the irregular shapes, of course, the jelly

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.840
fish are floating brains with appendages. Where we see that one is mentioned. Yeah, exactly. And

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.840
there's also another mention in the report about, I think it's the Mexican border of a jellyfish,

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:19.120
which I'll talk about too, but sphere or orb. So, of course, Aero had reported on this as well,

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.840
including some old data and blue book and so forth. Spheres were the most reported shape with

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.600
variations ranging from smooth, featureless orbs to spheres with visible openings or appendages.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.600
These objects prevalence suggests a possible standard in UAP design or function capable of

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.640
high maneuverability and speed. The diversity within the sphere category spanning from simple

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:46.240
polished appearances to more complex structures with appendages suggests a broad range of purposes

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.440
or technologies unique to the platform's mission and or the originator. The mention of appendages

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:57.280
on spheres instead of a ubiquitous smooth shape reminds me of the 2010 San Diego Sphere Siding.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.320
Have you heard of that? I don't think so now. It's a long video. It's about a 12 minute video of a

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:09.280
sphere that has what you would describe as almost an antenna around the circumference. And so that

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:15.440
is one really interesting sighting. Disk or saucer. Saucer shaped UAPs reported with and

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.160
without domes. If you want to look that up, go to the It's Redacted YouTube channel. This was posted

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.720
a couple years ago and maybe we can hold an image up to the screen. They have the full video. Saucer

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:30.240
shaped UAPs reported with and without domes were the second most common shape reported. Flat saucers

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:36.160
were reported as well. These being disks like objects without pronounced domes. Trilateral

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:42.800
biconvex UAPs are also reported in the data. So I think in the Aero Historical Reporting Trends in

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.400
2022, the saucer shapes were not featured as one of the most common sightings. So I could be wrong

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.160
there, but that is a, did you see it? No, I was just making a quick note for myself. Okay, let me

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.400
pull it. I can pull it up. I'll pull it up. You, why don't you read us about oval and tic-tac and

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.880
bring up some interesting stuff there, especially because I didn't Kirk Patrick imply that the

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:06.240
tic-tac may have been human technology? Did Kirk Patrick say that? I don't know, maybe.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:14.080
Oval or tic-tac oval shaped UAPs were infrequently reported within the data set and only after

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:20.400
approximately 2003, these UAPs either maintained a uniform egg-like symmetry occasionally tampered

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:26.160
into a teardrop shape. So cylinders with convex ends, tic-tacs fall into this category and

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.680
occasionally feature visible, visible protuberances on the top or bottom of the otherwise uniform

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:37.360
plan. So that'd be like the flavor incident, right? With the almost kind of features on the

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:44.080
bottom of the craft. So let me pull this up because this is a really, I think, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:48.080
yeah, I've seen that photo. So this is what I think of when I hear spear and some of the appendages.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:52.640
You guys may have, sorry, you may have heard of the sighting that's 2000. I can't remember the

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:59.520
year San Diego Sphere. The YouTube channel is long been defunct, but it's fantastic. It's redacted,

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.280
has a video on the entire, entire sighting. Will you read off the triangle description?

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.720
Oh, absolutely. Interesting point I want to touch on there.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.680
So triangles were among the rarest UAPs reported in the data. Most of these sightings were

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:19.840
equilateral triangles occasionally with vertical stabilizers visible on the top of the UAP.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.520
Along gated isosceles types were also reported, were also reported occasionally with the same

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:31.440
vertical stabilizers observed on the equilateral type. So the vertical stabilizers is an interesting

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.720
point. Conventional triangle designs such as the, you know, what you would call the TR3B does not

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.000
feature this. If you look at some other simple, some other similar designs like the alleged TR3A

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.200
Astra or so forth, or even that video Tom DeLonge likes to champion, it's that green

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:52.560
UFO video at night. One thing I noticed about that triangle is it has stabilizers on top. So

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.560
I've always tried to reference that because that sort of looks similar to like the X43 unmanned

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:02.000
NASA craft and so forth. So that's a, that's a pretty darn interesting. Yeah. All right.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.920
What are you looking at now in the report? Sorry, we're kind of bouncing back and forth

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.200
between the report, but you know, I thought it, I thought it was important for all of us to talk

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.640
about it and anything that stood out to you guys just leave in the comments. Any questions,

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:18.080
especially just let us know about the question. Yeah, I will say just like looking at these

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:23.200
different types and just kind of thinking about, you know, the different reports that's kind of

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.160
being summarized in here, right? Like spheres are, you know, the most common, but they're also kind

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.360
of the smallest. And then triangles are the rarest, but they can be anywhere from an F16 to a

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.400
size of a football field. Doesn't it say 600 feet as well? Or no, 600 feet is from other

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:44.640
avenues of research. Never mind. Believes. Yeah. Like football field size. Yeah. Football field

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:51.680
and 300 feet. So up to two football feats in length. I think the distinction between equilateral

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:58.320
and isosceles triangle is important as well. As far as all research I've done into human made

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:04.480
triangles, most of them seem equilaterally shaped. There's only a handful of cases dating back to

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:12.240
the late 80s, early 90s and early 2000s of isosceles kind of shape triangles. Well, we also have

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:16.800
not just triangles, but we also have boomerang arrowhead. Think of the Phoenix lights or think

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:21.920
of the testimony of the man who testified at Stephen Greer's NPC, Stephen Digna, who talked

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.360
about being at a bombing range. And before he left the service due to his health and

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:33.200
Raytheon contractors basically facilitating a bomb, a boomerang shaped craft that was projecting

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.320
something that came onto the range. That's an interesting testimony I'd like to revisit.

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.360
Yeah. And then also just a lot of the atmospheric or kind of unique emissions and

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:49.120
behavior seen by a lot of these as we see loss of time, visual disturbances, feelings of unease

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:56.480
or anxiety, electronic device malfunction. And I think Kevin Knuth at Seoul last year gave the

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:02.480
best examples of electromagnetic distortion and magnetic distortion. I highly recommend checking

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:09.360
that out. I did watch that. That was really good. Very good. What about the organic shapes?

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:14.720
Because I think that is probably one of the most interesting things for many people. Yep.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:19.360
Irregularly shaped UAPs, those that devise simple geometric description were among the

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.160
rarest reported sightings. Shapeshifting UAPs also appear in the dataset, typically having

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.760
a spherical or disc-like base form from which irregular geometries are seen to project.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.720
Floating brain or jellyfish UAPs are present as well, characterized by a central mass from

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.480
which multiple arms or spars hang downward. Finally, combined shapes were also observed,

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:47.040
including cubes within spheres, ringed saucers, and various rectangular and cuboid forms.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.880
The cuboid form, of course, that's interesting, calling back to Ryan Graves.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.000
Cube within a sphere is also one of those sightings as well.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.600
Specific mention of brain is very interesting to me specifically. The two don't really correlate,

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:04.560
but I often think back to the physics concept of Boltzmann brain. The idea behind a Boltzmann

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.720
brain from physicists can't remember his name Boltzmann, but it'd be far more efficient rather

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:15.040
than an existing universe with matter for just a basically a combination of electric

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.680
charged particles forming a brain, drifting through space, thinking of the material universe.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.440
I just think of that for the brain shape. Yeah, and something else just to point out

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.480
that might be interesting is in terms of unique emissions, what we see with these irregular

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.800
organics is that we see a temperature drop associated with these, and we don't really see

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.400
that reported with the other morphologies, which is interesting. I'd be interested if there's

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.920
any transmedial sighting or footage of these organic shapes, if there's also a temperature drop

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:53.280
and temperature gradient as it may enter C or other domain, for variable temperatures.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.480
That'd be kind of interesting to see the heat signature and how it alters over the course

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.000
of its flight. If perhaps when it moves faster, it heats up and so forth. Of course, we're not

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.640
privy to any of this information, but we got our public report on our hands. Well, I think someone

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:14.160
in the chat mentioned earlier, Oak Shannon. I think this is a very, very interesting kind of

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.520
little tidbit in this document here. For section five, restricted US government historical records,

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.400
there is a call out to a specific, it's a serial number that corresponds to an official NSA report

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:31.760
published in 1978, which people have now confirmed was included, this specific citation was included

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.840
in Oak Shannon's notes, which is very interesting. The specific notes, I'm trying to remember the

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:41.280
actual event I've referenced it a few times. The specific event, it may have been at Los Alamos

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.400
National Labs where Oak Shannon took notes from some detailed speakers. I referenced here when

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:53.440
Oak Shannon relayed information he was told about an undersea base, a USO base. So he writes about

01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:00.000
that. He writes about connection to possible MHD propulsion physics with, I think, a 3.5 gigahertz

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.360
range. Numerous interesting notes about programs. I think he mentions Bobby Ray Inman in that.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.320
That's just off the top of my head, but these notes are for a panel of speakers that I think was at

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.040
Los Alamos in the late 80s. Yep. And then just to add about this report as well. The substance of

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.840
the report concerns scientific research in the Soviet Union on the topics of parapsychology,

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:25.040
Psi, and biological effects on UAPs on human beings. Additionally, the existence of this

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.760
reporting stream demonstrates that US intelligence was explicitly tasked to collect on foreign entities

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:35.200
active in areas often relegated to the fringes of scientific research, including parapsychology,

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.440
and the biological effects of encounters with UAP. And this shouldn't be surprising, guys,

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.600
even people who are uncomfortable with the idea of Psi like myself, it's pretty new to them.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:50.320
Let's think back to the NSWC crane project in which not only SAIC, but the Project Stargate,

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.520
which was researching the Psi phenomena from SRI and the CIA. But even in 2011 and onward,

01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:01.440
the O&R, the Office of Naval Research, published papers on human sixth sense and human psionic

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:07.440
abilities, which is still extremely strange. This is why we need good smart guys like Max,

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.040
who are really well researched into some of this this Psi connection. Absolutely.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.960
So let's go. I think we got some questions. We'll look through the chat with it. We'll look through

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:22.160
here. So have you or anyone you know made any inroads to getting information around the energy

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.800
source of these vehicles? Has anyone talked about plasma? Yes. I think Edgar Fouchet in the TR3B

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:35.040
discusses superheated plasma along with mercury. Inroads, as far as the energy source, there's

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.960
disagreements. I know really smart people who think that we haven't quite cracked zero point

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.400
systems. I think to the story of Brad Sorensen, where zero point systems are applicable. I've

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:51.040
heard from numerous people that electrogravity are a thing. Could you mind passing me a soda?

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:56.160
Yeah, I got you. I think electrogravity are possibly a thing too. Of course, there's the story

01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:07.120
of MFD, MHD. So there's quite a bit of information around energy systems. Nothing concrete yet.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:12.880
I don't know if you have heard anything else. Sorry, I was just kind of going off topic there.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.000
Do you guys believe Grush will ever be allowed on a skiff? They've now had nearly 18 months to

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.840
hide everything. That is a good point, right? If locations are violated, then there's not

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:30.240
immediate actionable intelligence follow-ups that these locations will likely be cleared or

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:37.520
further obfuscations created. If I remember, Grush did not get in a skiff with Verchette?

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.160
I don't think he got in a skiff with them at all. Okay, yeah. I know that Burleson has at least

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:52.800
been privy to the op-ed by Grush. I have these conversations occurred outside of Skiff, I'm

01:38:52.800 --> 01:39:02.160
not sure, but to me, it's pretty unacceptable. Okay, yeah. We talked about this a little bit,

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.640
but do you think Boebert's comments were purposeful in order to harm public perception on this topic?

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:12.560
Judi, by the way, she talked. I just think she probably carries a bit of the stigma, because

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.080
I'd like to mention, guys, before the hearings even started, the cameraman,

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.080
when people were filing in and looked at me and said, oh, this is going to go on Ancient Aliens,

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:25.760
right? What am I going to say to that? No, this is a serious congressional hearing. Right outside,

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.520
I had to run out, use the restroom before we started. I hear a bunch of staffers or congressmen

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.160
talking, this is what happens when you leave YouTube autoplay on for too long. If you're finding

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.240
my channel off autoplay, first of all, thanks for being here. But second of all, I mean, that's

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:44.960
so foolish. And that's the sort of mind and stigma that has been manufactured. And it's

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:48.800
understandable if you have felt that and experienced that, because that is very well

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:54.560
orchestrated by the CIA all the way back since 52. But many people fall victim to this.

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.720
Yeah. I mean, it's one thing just to make jokes and just being coy about it and just being like,

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.520
oh, yeah, Ancient Aliens, whatever. It's funny to joke about. But I did notice that there were

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:11.360
quite a few people that they talk about it as if this is... There isn't really anything there

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.640
there. And it's still kind of a conspiracy. And who are these people and what are these programs?

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:23.760
She treats it the same as maybe like chemtrails or other popular conspiracies like birds.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.720
But also from her perspective, she's kind of been like one of the conspiracy theorists in

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.040
Congress. That's kind of her reputation, if you will. So, hey, I mean, roll with what you know.

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:40.160
But I don't think her comments were super helpful or really appreciated by people

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.000
in the UFO world that wanted sober conversation about this.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.720
And I think a lot of the people that are going to affect change when we have

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:51.680
Congress people like this are going to be their staffers. There's a world of staffers that take

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.400
this very seriously who want to learn. And they want to affect change and they want to have the

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.400
information to brief. Not brief, that might be a poor word, but to inform the person they work

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.040
for and so forth. So, Magic says, have you seen Sheehan making the rounds lately? What are your

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:10.480
thoughts on everything he is saying? Seems worlds apart from just getting into the public site,

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.400
guys. Well, we had lunch yesterday right by Sheehan in this crazy, crazy gray hair. And

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.000
he also had like a disclosure event outside of the park right after.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.800
There was a rally outside like a block away from the Rayburn building where the hearing happened.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.640
And he spoke and then a couple other individuals spoke as well. Yeah.

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:37.440
I think for the amount of information Sheehan puts out, he needs to start supplying adequate

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:44.080
research, go along it, alongside of it or evidence or other people to confirm these statements.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.720
Danny Sheehan, of course, has been very consequential as a really interesting person,

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.160
but before he continues to put forward new information, he kind of needs to figure out

01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:02.560
ways to back up his things he said previously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what I will say about that

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.440
with Sheehan is I think he's not a stranger to kind of fighting the government as well.

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.680
And I think part of it is he has kind of a role to play as kind of the legal person that's helping

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:18.640
facilitate stuff behind the scenes with certain players. But also as we see kind of with this

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:25.040
new Paradigm Institute, I think, you know, there's kind of a public perception or kind of awareness

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:29.120
intention there of just trying to get that organization set up. So I think that's kind

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:33.520
of why we're seeing this like interesting stuff with Sheehan, because traditionally, you know,

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.600
he's like, he's a lawyer, he's an attorney, he's kind of working on the investigative space,

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.720
but then also seeing him with like the new Paradigm Institute and that stuff as well,

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:45.600
it's like, okay, how do you reconcile that? Selling degrees. Yeah. Yeah. For tens of thousands of

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.400
dollars. Jimmy says, I have friends who believe it's almost definitely Chinese or Russian tech,

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.880
especially Chinese. What, if any, gives you the confirmation this is fact alien slash

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:59.920
NHI? Well, I think quite a few factors. One of them is the persistent existence of this phenomenon

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:05.680
for more than 80 years. In fact, you can even go into other stories in history, but even dating

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.760
back to the Magenta Crash in 1933, there are similarities in this phenomenon in terms of

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.480
crash shape, in terms of performance characteristics of craft. I mean, you had Nazi scientists,

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.200
Herman Oberth, studying flying saucer flight dynamics, estimating tens if not hundreds of

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:23.200
thousands miles per hour, these things would be flown. You can also look at the G-forces

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:28.160
experienced by some of these craft. It's not a ballistic missile that can handle 120 Gs. It's

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:34.160
not a human being that can sustain nine Gs before seeing permanent injury. I know Lou talked about

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.760
this during the hearing or was it UAPBF? We talked about G-forces experienced by the craft. Was that

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.200
the hearing? That was at the hearing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So Lou kind of lobald that a little bit.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.440
If you look at the work by Kevin Knuth and estimating flight characteristics of unidentified

01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:51.840
aerial phenomenon, which is a great paper, I highly recommend everybody read this.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.120
It analyzes the performance characteristics of not just the 2004 Nimitz, but also the 1986

01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.240
Japan Airlines case and other such cases. G-forces of this, these craft can be experienced

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:10.960
of up to 5,000 Gs. That's very different. There's also numerous reports from under fast walkers that

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.960
NORAD and NASA and the DSP defense support program would call these craft back in the 60s, 70s,

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.280
and 80s that had a term for craft that were entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere.

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:28.640
These would not show classical characteristics of fuel burning rockets and traditional

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:33.440
prosaic technologies. These things would sometimes arrive from deep space or return to deep space.

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.480
I don't know, especially in the 60s and 70s of Chinese tech, that's playing into do that.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.520
Yeah. Again, we're also talking about sightings that have been seen even before

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.960
modern weapons as well. How far do we really want to go with this?

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:57.040
I would say there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there was a phenomenon that existed well

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:04.560
before the Second World War and the creation of the world superpowers, all that stuff. You can try

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.520
to figure out whether or not that's alien non-human. I personally think that that seems to be the

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.680
conclusion just based off of those historical reports. I know there's a lot of researchers

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:19.040
that look at that pre-modern history of UFO sightings. Which is very valid.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.840
I think your friend is right about the idea that some of these craft might be ARB of Chinese or

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:35.440
Russian origin. Just like many of the ARB are of United States origin. Some of our allies possibly

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.640
also have their own technology as well. I just think that many of the craft, especially when

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.120
you start looking at craft characteristics and differences in reported craft that are considered

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.200
ARB versus non-human craft, just the difference in the craft makeup. Non-human craft often described

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.720
as perfect, rivetless, seamless, no visible means of propulsion, somehow able to create,

01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.480
go faster than the speed of sound and decelerate quickly without any sonic booms,

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.600
without with very minimal or no electromagnetic signatures or signatures of any kind.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.240
The performance characteristics of these craft are not prosaic even to when people say oh well

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:16.960
you know military is 20 years ahead, there's you know ballistic missiles 20 years from now

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.120
are not surviving 5,000 geese of force dropping from 15,000 feet to sea level in less than two

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:29.440
seconds. Okay got anything about my question on getting remote viewing under mainstream

01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:34.640
science scrutiny? Are there any efforts there from me? Yes, yes, yes, I see. Yes, and talking to

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.560
Chris from Area 52, I would really like to maybe see if we can put on some public displays

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.840
of remote viewing to maybe you know introduce the the channel to whether the efficacy or

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:52.320
or not not if there's nothing there. I would absolutely like to do that because this would

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.720
be something we'd all be learning together. Well they had a lot of those studies in the late 80s

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.520
and 90s and at least according to the government there was no there wasn't really a basis to

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:07.200
continue funding of it but then ultimately that whole program got transferred over to SAIC in 1995.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:12.320
So do you believe the blue book classified version of his story where he says he saw the images this

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:18.800
is um this is Danny Sheehan. Yes after yeah I would say after like I think there's been some

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:23.600
records that have come out of the era like out of this like whole declassification process and

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.120
particularly the Air Force Blue Book documents. The symbols that he that Sheehan has like drawn out

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:34.400
or whatever um like. This was put in NARA recently right the National Archives. Yep yep so like he

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.560
like the depiction I think the depiction that he gave of those symbols is like dead accurate

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.800
of the symbols that are in these blue book files. Yeah I'd also like to reference it is a fact that

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.640
there were programs working alongside blue book that were not unacknowledged but not referenced

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.880
this would be project Stork out of Patel and then you can also adhere to the testimony of other

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:58.560
whistleblowers such as Steven Lufkin who said that he was privy to a program more classified

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.720
than blue book a more classified blue book basically where he was shown some of the Roswell

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:09.520
degree and so yes I think that is a really good really good question. Question how do you guys

01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.200
picture disclosure personally I think Richette's whistleblower type protections won't pass but

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:19.360
if it does I think there has to be someone walking out of Lockheed etc. If there are pension protections

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.520
I think that could be possible that's what I have to say. Yep I think that specific language of it

01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:30.560
is they're going to give whistleblower protections to any whistleblower that has knowledge of

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.600
basically taxpayer funds that are being used so I think the first inquiry right is like government

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:39.600
funds taxpayer money that's being spent on this and I think that that's good I hope that those

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:45.120
protections pass um but then I think the second part right and this is it goes back to kind of

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.280
the theory of like how does this get funded well if the government's not writing a black check to

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:53.600
Lockheed Martin are they taking money from investors potentially and then like how aware of those

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.600
investors in those types of programs and that's a question that's really kind of the messier

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.120
legal questions that open up from that questions like that you have been talking about and thinking

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:05.200
about quite a bit the last couple of days I've talked with a lot of people about it it's very

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.520
interesting okay Eric says uh any comments on how put off you brought Lew into the program and many

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.840
others he met with H teller and worked on graph control best candidate for involvement in legacy

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:21.600
program I am oh I am really eagerly awaiting his appearance in the program he needs to get subpoena

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:26.560
yeah he needs to get subpoena too but I think he'd be uh I think he'd be a agreeable witness

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.880
because there's hostile witnesses there's non agreeable witnesses and there's agreeable witnesses

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:37.760
he should be encouraged to attend the hearing and a closed yeah senate section okay lou said this

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:45.280
okay you're talking about lou in the cold war same as grush um do you believe that UAP are alive

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.960
as Luna said a theory I've seen in the genre for a while well as we talked about in the

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:55.200
immaculate constellation report the idea of biological crap would then um would then kind

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.360
of encourage that I think it's quite possible you know we talk about this all the time I don't

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.960
think UAP and non-human intelligence is mutually exclusive or is is really siloed if there's one

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.120
non-human intelligence here it opens the door for numerous types of non-human intelligence

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.880
all with different capabilities and um basically propulsion systems and methods of travel and

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:21.200
methods of communication and methods of detailing their presence are all quite possible yeah I will

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.440
say the movie nope Jordan Peele great movie scary but I can definitely see that happening

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:35.120
after the specific mention of brain in the uh IC report it's it's very very very startling to me

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.520
okay oh okay this is a good one for us max can you speculate on the origin of the sphere that

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:48.320
was located underneath NSWC for anybody that doesn't know um the program Kermit and I worked on

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.960
together was um the off-world technologies division yep experienced by Green Beret 18 Bravo weapon

01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:02.000
sergeant RA uh witness RA who in the early 2010s was sent to RA for an advanced weapons trading

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.680
course and here he and one other person because of their high clearance levels and because of

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.720
some of their accomplishments level five of sphere um you know deployments and so forth were

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.840
basically taken underground by a contractor seen some interesting Russian ballistics and

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:22.000
some interesting weaponry as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant you have to do proficient with all

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.880
forms of small arms fire and then they're brought into a place deep underground um the air was

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:36.640
described as very damp stale cold by RA into an off-world technologies division here the contractor

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:43.920
who we both highly suspect as SAIC show two pieces of technology one and almost tablet device that

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:48.960
seemed to be projecting writing uh RA did not know if this was in his head or actually physically

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:55.040
like a holographic projection of writing and this piece was said to have been recovered uh during

01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:01.840
being recovered and was considered a weapon due to an electric or an energetic discharge during

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:07.120
recovery the other piece was a sphere about the size of a baseball with a small indent at the top

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:13.200
this was described as metallic but very smooth and almost shimmering like oil on water

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:20.560
RA was told that this specific piece of technology somehow interacted with consciousness as far as

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:26.960
the origins of this I've talked to max the person asking the question and Kermit here about another

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:32.240
individual Navy connect Navy connected who likely interacted with the same technology a couple

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:42.080
decades prior so if that's the case the Navy might have had an active program uh with this piece for

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:48.960
weird kind of the size stuff we were talking about the origins if it's housed alongside that gauntlet

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:53.600
tablet type thing that is considered weapons technology one has to assume that this was also

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:58.480
a piece of technology recovered from a crash retrieval absolutely and I also think just the

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:02.240
nature of the crash retrievals themselves and we kind of see this in other reports here and there is

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.320
as these things are taken in right as we're retrieving these craft were then trying to

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:12.640
you know piece off these different areas of like okay Lockheed figure out how the craft work SAIC

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:16.400
figure out how this orb works right north figure out how this engine works right and just trying

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:21.440
to piece these different areas and giving these technologies transferred over to private industry

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:28.960
to try to see if they can figure out how this shit works you know I at least don't know the origin

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:36.240
but I can with confidence say that this was taken off of a crash retrieval where when are there

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.840
multiple no idea absolutely no idea the witness I've spoken to that encountered this was on the

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:48.800
other side of the country the California to be exact so was this program shelved that the

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:53.600
Navy used with this and then this is just housed for further analysis and I would like to harken

01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:00.320
back to Harold Malmgren who spoke about being briefed in the 1960s about an other world technologies

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:06.080
division yep very close yep do you guys feel like any of these quote-unquote UFOs can be top secret

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:11.920
government weapons absolutely alien reproduction vehicle absolutely absolutely it's just I mean

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.280
UFO is an unidentified flying object you see like an experimental aircraft you don't know what the

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:21.360
hell it is you're going to think it's a UFO right but it could just be something like a you know new

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.240
drone or you know the new self-claim whatever so yeah what do you say we'll go for 10 more minutes

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.560
answering questions yeah all right guys we'll keep going for some questions for a few more minutes and

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:35.760
then we'll uh okay we answered that about how put off Eric sorry if we're getting to the question

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.200
slow guys I just think you know I'm glad Kermit feels the same way everyone's taking their time

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.920
to ask questions so really appreciate it y'all yeah and these are I told you Kermit everybody

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:52.560
ask the best questions here okay with the admission that yes USG has a crash retrieval in reverse

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:57.120
engineering program for UAP this validates claims of Herrera and Weigand is there a lawsuit in the

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:06.000
works reparations I think their cases are you know far more kind of uh I guess Michael's case

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.640
doesn't relegate to that as much because remember Michael's case talks about seeing an alien

01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.560
reproduction vehicle this specifically octagonal shaped I'm still trying to track down the manufacturer

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:22.960
for that Greer thinks it's locky but has proposed no evidence but Weigand his story is one of those

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:28.160
more classic crash retrievals and with some of the comments in the IC report about you know

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.600
psychological effects and then the probability that was a DOE nest team you know you kind of have

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.520
to analyze that with a more credible with a different lens and you do with Michael now with

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:44.960
the testimony of ARV I just am waiting to see a dang report of a octagonal ARV please yeah okay let me

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.040
okay okay talking about the oak shane and serial numbers

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.360
what do you think it will take for mainstream scientific analysis to start looking into remote

01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:01.680
viewing and either confirm or debunk it for good that's a good question I and I have to assume

01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:08.560
academia approaching UAP and how they approach UAP is likely the same approach they take to

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.880
promote viewing I cannot think of a reason why the subject should not be studied seriously

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:18.320
especially when the Navy studies yeah this might seem like a very random call out but I'm I'm now

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.840
remembering there's a 60 minutes documentary that happened that looked at basically there's a scientific

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.800
study that was done where they were trying to prove precognition where individuals were like

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:32.640
shown as a set of numbers or something and they basically had to predict what the next number

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:37.920
and the sequence was going to be like before they even saw it and what they determined from that

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:44.160
is that it seemed that there was some type of correlation between you know we what we call

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.360
a sixth sense or something that's like you know exists in our mind but there was there was a very

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.720
real trend where like these individuals could like use this precognitive ability so I feel like

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.680
stuff like that and just kind of getting those types of reports and just getting the awareness out

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:05.360
and then you know trying to come up with ways kind of similar to that study I know it's kind of like

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:10.240
weirdly specific and it's just off the dome but I think things like that will kind of help us try to

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:14.800
figure that out it's strange to me that kind of the fallback is oh the CIA did a study in the 80s

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:20.640
and their Stargate and nothing came from it yeah it's not a reason not to study the subject no

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:25.280
okay thoughts on the skinny bob video I think I get to ask this every time I have I have no

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:32.080
thoughts about it I I have never once studied it at least from a first glance it looks to be a

01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:37.440
little a little too smooth for for realness what do you say Kermit but I have not studied it at all

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:46.720
yeah I I don't I don't um I don't have an opinion on any videos that claim to depict biologics

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:53.440
or non-human intelligence so question and of course like you know if the politics are pertinent

01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:57.200
to UAP of course we'll talk about it not to be political but don't you worry that people like

01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:01.360
bobert and trump might lessen the credibility of the top rick half the country doesn't take him

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:06.400
seriously that that is something I think we talked about that if trump really pushed disclosure

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.120
would that kind of be used as a talking point to discredit disclosure because so many people find

01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.640
trump in the kind of poor taste it raises a good question uh bobert as well as we kind of saw with

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:23.760
the the hearing um wrong attitude in my opinion yeah I will say I had an interesting conversation

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.240
with some staffers on the democrat side they kind of brought up the same point too of just like hey

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:33.200
you know particularly in the hearing yesterday a lot of the representatives in that were republican

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.040
and I think as we think about the next four years and trumping president and all those new

01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:43.600
cabinet positions and whatnot um you know I think we'll we'll start to see some more answers but

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.640
again I think to your point right when bobert and trump talk about this I think people particularly

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.240
on the other side kind of see it a certain way and they'll just kind of check out and be like oh

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.360
trump's a crazy person and this just confirms my own opinion um I do think he could be a good asset

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.600
it's just it's really coming down to the communication it's tough to navigate now just with so much

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:07.360
distrust in any administration really yeah yeah so you know we'll see it it's a great question and

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.800
if it's yeah go ahead we should talk about trump's uncle because uh that's something that I love to

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.600
bring up when people get political about this so donald trump's uncle was john trump who was a

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:24.160
mit professor who was he worked for the radiation laboratory at lincoln lab and he was like one of

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:30.000
the early founders of radar and in 1943 when tesla died john trump was called in by the united states

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.920
to basically document all of tesla's patents and make sure that none of them were dangerous so

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:38.400
I don't want to get too speculative I don't want to say that john trump was part of legacy program

01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:42.000
but of all the people with all the relevant experience I think his uncle would have been

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:48.640
someone that would have known something that's a great point so so what is uh kms what is your

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:52.720
opinion on gold's testimony if you consider begging for money a testimony I think it's disappointing

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:58.880
he was not asked about material transfer between all sap uh bigelow aerospace and lock emart yeah I

01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:05.280
agree I it honestly it's like that was that's what I was expecting and ultimately it's like maybe

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.000
you know maybe gold wasn't really involved with that and maybe you know they had conversations

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.520
prior and they're like I can't really talk about it because I just don't really know anything but

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:17.040
the fact they didn't even ask the question to begin with just like the public can know about that

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.960
because like we the public were aware of all sap we're aware of bigelow and all this stuff

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:26.480
why didn't you ask the question at all yeah that was weird the smell test gold was a really nice

02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:32.160
well-to-do meaning guy but nasa has been caught lying about UFOs before so then be the most

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:39.920
transparent agency he's ever worked for you know I I'd uh I'd have to agree with that so so Juan

02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:46.000
again thank you sir even the hoc are aware aware carl nel is uh first hand yeah an army futures

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:55.440
command and deputy cto of north of bromance that's a guy who should have testified yep yep what uh

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.520
what do you make of the idea that nh i may be a component of preventing disclosure I wouldn't

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.400
be surprised but I I don't have too much of a thesis there I do like to think back to David

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.280
grush talking about agreements with uh with nh i yeah and if there's I mean if there's positive

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.240
and negative nh i and you know we can't really figure out what they want to do here it wouldn't

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.480
be hard to assume that there's nh i that don't really agree with yeah right from an outside

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:24.160
perspective it's always really difficult for me to attribute uh human motivation to non-human

02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:29.920
intelligence yeah are we okay are we heading towards what Reagan spoke of or humanity unites

02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:35.280
to fight an outside force listen I think Reagan put plenty of defenses uh plenty of money into

02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.840
those defenses under the sdi star wars program we had some really good stuff and yeah I think

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:45.440
there's a lot of funds that were given to other programs and used for for uap stuff yeah but I

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:49.600
think kind of coming back to the threat narrative here I think there's there's been some discussion

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.960
around that a little bit it just like you know what these things are and how this is going to be

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:57.200
presented to the public I know Reagan's comments were really about like you know what happens if

02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:01.200
an alien threat gets revealed and then like the public you know the world would just unite all

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.560
around together yeah I don't really feel like this this is going to happen with this situation I

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.120
think that I think disclosure the way it's playing out is is being done in a way that like ensures

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:16.480
like national sovereignty instead of like you know this being like oh shit they're showing up and we

02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:21.920
have five years to prepare a type thing like something like from a movie um so yeah it it's

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.920
kind of interesting but I don't I don't think it's going to be like this big international

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:30.320
like new world order yeah you know I think really it's just people trying to get to the bottom of

02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:36.880
it and a lot of people I think use that to push the um star or blue beam blue beam theory oh yeah

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:42.720
blue beam okay question from truth sauce the video you did about mark mcandellish was awesome

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:48.480
thank you sir any further discussions on uh with the living friend that threatened you

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.080
yes and he threatened me again and I found other people who he's threatened as well

02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:01.280
so maybe he needs to be summoned as a hostile witness maybe he needs to be summoned okay

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.320
awakening to reality what's up man jonathan thank you for joining looking for the uh looking for the

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.280
cues okay yes match part just talked about this remember all four of technologies is mentioned

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:16.320
by herald malmgren in relation to richard the cell I think he specifically said other world

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:24.480
technologies but still and he was uh the cell was cia director as well yep yep okay okay so

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.040
long ago when we got claims that people from greerstein the pentagon and co have been opting

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.960
funds illegally and estimated two trillion were unaccounted for how can congress get accounts

02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:38.160
and tell them about you trying to talk to kathryn austin fits yeah so I mean I reached out to kathryn

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:43.200
a handful of times uh when I was writing my like recent report on the legal financial framework a

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.360
lot of the stuff that I kind of pulled and talked about really comes from her salari missing money

02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:53.440
dot com website uh very I mean just treasure trove of information about financial covert

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.320
operations and stuff like that highly encourage y'all to check that out if you're interested in that

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:05.360
um but now no response from her unfortunately but this estimated two trillion dollars unaccounted

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:12.160
for that still exists um because a lot of people are really aware of this but the department of

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:18.400
defense is now being required to basically go through full independent audits of itself which

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:25.360
it's never really had to do that in its history before up until actually 2017 interesting date um

02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:31.600
so and what's interesting is just in the past six and seven years of pentagon audits if you look at

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:37.680
just the money and just kind of the remediations that they've made it is it is a black hole that is

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:41.920
trillions of dollars worth and it's not going away and fits all not gone away fits said it's

02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:46.960
not just do d but housing and urban development it's a lot of other agencies yep it was she

02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:53.040
I think from her account she saw cumulative four trillion dollars move from department of defense

02:04:53.040 --> 02:05:00.640
and department of uh housing and urban hud sorry hud and do d four trillion cumulative in that one

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.720
year that she was so this is just an interesting thing while we scroll down get to the rest of

02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:08.800
the questions none of these guys were whistleblowers um yeah I agree with that in the sense that we

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.920
talked about earlier that uh we're both familiar with accounts where people who are planning to

02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.960
testify have been threatened up to the day of not to and uncertain congressman being a little bit

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:26.800
surprised or expecting kind of mercy or more firsthand people to uh to uh go for okay hey

02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:31.360
here's one especially for you kermit have you guys come across the work of trevor james constable

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.840
he talked about sky creatures back in 77 and says the movie nope has similarities to his work

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:40.640
I personally haven't but I I'd love to kind of check that out now I also found the movie pretty

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:43.760
interesting I'm gonna have to put that in my notes so thank you for the reference thank you pun

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.880
shrink I appreciate I appreciate that a lot for james constable okay sorry we'll look through

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:57.520
more questions um hey thank you john s you rock as well sky creatures so cool uh let's see okay

02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:04.720
okay let's see uh so yeah michael made those kind of claims and I I still don't know if there's

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:13.840
any veracity to them um and so forth so weighing boss uh thank you so much for the five bucks why

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:20.960
were no ad runs or ads run against uap caucus members deliberately so is the topic that obscure

02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:26.800
I think the topic is that obscure like is this is this saying like during their like when they

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:32.640
were seeking election maybe for uap caucus maybe maybe in the sense of like why are there no

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:38.080
inflammatory posts against guys like lester or uh some of the guys really trying to talk to

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:46.400
staffers and so forth okay got you um I think it's just obscure yeah I will say like the

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:51.280
the congressional hearings were very well attended but I will say you could probably guess who a

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:55.520
majority of the people were there just based off of who talks a lot on twitter and reddit

02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:02.160
but yeah anybody asking about brad brad has given me nothing but yep like yelling at me and all

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:08.880
caps are giving me death threats so leslie gain thought it was disturbing but also had a laugh

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:12.800
with me about it so if you can divulge who are the most interesting people you connected with

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.000
at dc it's been a good way to meet movers and shakers the most interesting person not at liberty

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.440
to kind of uh talk about that but some of the interesting people uh talking with lou talking

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:32.080
with gallaudet every second okay I made a list of people I talked to so let me go through okay

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:37.440
so lester nair jesse michael's chris from area 52 amar from yes theory tim gallaudet jeremy

02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:42.240
corbell michael gold lou elezano james foch merrick von reinenkamp timber chet eric burleson

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:46.640
nancy mace danie sheehan michael schellenberger missleman jack awesome twitter account matt

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:51.360
ford matthew pines leslie cane um and probably a couple more and I got to talk to all these people

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:56.800
yeah right the conversations it we had like a 15 hour day yesterday yeah it was like I mean

02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:03.680
started at 7am and then we got back to the hotel at like 10 we were so pooped we were walking back

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:08.400
from the place in which uapdf was held back to our hotel and I think both of us were just kind of

02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:14.560
having like a a really surreal experience absolutely I mean yesterday was oh probably one of the most

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:22.960
consequential days I've ever had and true honor I mean we're just we're just two two guys and

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:29.440
we get to uh I'm really proud of the community for kind of stop uh not being so much of a closed

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:34.880
door community and I'm seeing a lot of people Democrats Republicans uh smart lawyers like

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:41.120
Ivan a lot of these people kind of communicating and talking yeah it's a lot of people working

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:47.840
together and it's it's it's very humbling to see it and it's it's very exciting because it's it's a

02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:53.440
lot of people that have good motivations and they're inquisitive and they just want the truth

02:08:53.440 --> 02:09:02.720
you know and it's everyone's on the same team um so oh what if we're what if we're a science

02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.800
experiment or perhaps our existence hinges on us not knowing we're an experiment maybe that's why

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:11.360
they don't want to disclose that's quite possible I mean there are reports even

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:17.920
outside of Bob Lazar of the human genome being tampered with or humans being and I don't want to

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:22.560
count in Zachariah's Sitchin and the the Sumerians because I think there's uh some problems with

02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:27.520
those translations but it's a very valid theory yeah I mean Lude talks about in his book he equates

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.000
humanity to the 800 pound gorilla in the exhibit right when we steal the tranquilizer gun and then

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:38.800
what happens when we uh knock on the zookeeper's door good question Viagra 500 milligrams I get a

02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:44.080
chance to watch NAPS new documentary we had an awkward episode with Michael um no I I have not

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:49.600
seen that yet I that's investigating alien and I will watch it at some point I just I haven't seen

02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:56.320
anything besides the trailer uh is that what's this new Dan Farah docus that's being overhyped I

02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:59.920
don't know I don't know the do you know anything about the documentary because I've been asked

02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:05.120
like multiple times is this person that you talk to in the documentary I'm mostly no what is the

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.880
documentary yeah I I don't know too much about it I know it's been kind of talked about in tandem

02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:18.320
with Fox's production the program um to my knowledge this Farah films doc is going to feature

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:27.920
like 30 different high level witnesses um 30 30 and the mostly government military I hope so

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:33.760
but I find that I find that tough to however I don't think there's been any communications about

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:38.240
if that documentary has finished what the state of it is and whether or not it's going to be

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:44.560
published I think people I think the rumor was it was supposed to be published before the election

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:49.360
and then it was after the election and then like even still it's just it there's no date on the

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:54.320
calendar yet for it but it it exists it's real and the people that are in the film uh that we

02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:59.280
got to shake hands with they talked about it with us they're like yes this is like the Farah film I

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:05.360
was in this whatever um and I think I think even um Michael gold even Michael during the hearing is

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.240
like I'm going to talk about it in this uh this documentary that's coming I'm like okay cool like

02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:16.480
we need to see that now so who is Dan Farah that's a good question because I like a documentary

02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:22.640
I have no idea I look this up thoughts on project gravitar the new models are doc so I got to talk

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:28.720
at length to Chris from area 52 who just got on Luigi from project gravitar Chris got me really

02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:36.800
excited um did did you talk to him at all about gravitar um I no and I told him straight up the

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:41.520
reason I don't really talk about Bob Lazarus because I'm so biased towards Bob that it's difficult

02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:46.880
for me to talk about it but he he got me hyped what do you see about Dan uh Dan's a documentary

02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.520
filmmaker but he also produced movies uh notably ready player one which was okay

02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:59.520
movie that aired in theaters 2018 that was one of the movies of all time yeah so as uh I've heard

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.120
that another hearing is happening on the 18th or whatever the next hearing is may you do I think

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:07.440
this is more a Senate hearing on arrows specifically so don't get your hopes up about that that's

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:13.600
going to be probably pretty dry it will be interesting to see how Kosolowski discusses kind

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.400
of the the arrows kind of operations you can comparing that back to how Kirk Patrick's made

02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:23.280
those statements will answer five more and then and then we'll wrap up truth so I hated the comment

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.320
about some guy in a Winnebago the same thing happening now happens in the 40s 50s including the

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:35.920
52 flap uh who said who said that I that was uh that was the comment about like the credibility

02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:40.240
of the witnesses like you guys aren't all just bunch of people living in a Winnebago that was

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.400
that was the comment oh to make fun of people going like to see craft outside of area 51

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.960
all the guys would get into something like something like that maybe I thought it was in

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:54.720
the context of like they were at like one of the representatives asked Elizondo like what his um

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.480
what his career kind of wasn't like what his experience was and it was like the point of like

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:03.360
okay you're not just like some crackpot in Winnebago okay well yeah needs to stop getting

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.360
names thrown around like crackpot ancient aliens or youtube being left on the stick but just needs

02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.320
to stop yeah like Jimmy says thoughts on the document from Sarbakar on Oppenheimer von Neumann

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.520
being involved with crash retrievals I've covered Sarbakar very often and I think he's an extremely

02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:23.760
credible individual you're pretty familiar with Sarbakar too right ish okay yeah I I would I put

02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.160
a lot of I yeah but I am not surprised there especially because he's mentioned him at other

02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:33.200
times as well uh let's see truth sauce did that bother you shouldn't these congress people be

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:37.920
more well informed for the same nuclear base incursions okay I understand your your comment

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.120
now in this context yes of course that bothers me I hate the name calling the throwing around

02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:47.680
there's rude snide comments I hear outside and it's just what we do it Kermit just talked about

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:56.480
the byproduct of the stigma being so darn successful yeah uh okay let's uh let's go through uh see

02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:02.080
awakening see a man Winnebago catching strays uh okay we'll do this one and then one more question

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.240
if one pops up while we're talking what are your thoughts on abductions uh this is still a difficult

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:13.520
question I love the work of John Mack uh it's difficult for me to connect abductions to what

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:18.480
I'd say my bread and butter is which is crash retrieval reverse engineering and witness testimony

02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:25.840
analysis so uh the abductions are fascinating then there's a lot of witnesses under a career

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:31.120
that talk about human abductions for my lab purposes and so forth one witness in specific

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:37.600
10 8 9 2 and his witness log uh I need to do more due diligence and read more of John Mack's book

02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:42.640
because I'm not closed off to the idea I'm just ill informed yeah I'm kind of in the same boat I mean

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:47.840
again my my bread and butter is the excel file that is the classified balance sheet and trying to see

02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:55.120
that um but in terms of abductions like my thoughts of it is like you know kind of backed with Mack is

02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:00.560
like Mack's kind of uh thesis of it is like you know these people are you know genuine they have

02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.200
these experiences and they're telling like an accurate genuine account of their experience

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:08.880
now is that something that's happening physically like are they being physically taking from the

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.200
space and put into a spaceship or is this happening like within their mind of like they're

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:17.040
having this like experience within consciousness so they don't really understand but in their

02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.720
brain they think it's like an abduction event you know it could be something like both but what I

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.920
will say is I'm kind of a you know I come from a Catholic background so I do fundamentally believe

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:29.280
in things like you know possession demonic possession things like that and I think that

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.320
there is a little bit of tie-in between those two things I wouldn't be surprised okay we got uh

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:39.680
three two more and we'll go through it or truth sauce three more we talked about we talked about

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.720
the new netflix series I haven't seen it have you seen uh investigation alien no but I'm watching

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:51.840
it this weekend okay perfect perfect uh damply dude says do you think uh do you think about UFOs

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:55.520
and aliens make them aware of you I think it's quite possible in any scenario the longer you

02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.480
stare into the void the more it stares back that's one of the best realms of cosmic horror so I think

02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:05.680
it's it's uh quite possible I've been told by some uh close friends you know not necessarily

02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:10.080
experiencers but just like the the hitchhiker effect it will now be in play once you get

02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:15.120
yeah closer but we have unfortunately we have not seen an orb in the hotel room no no yeah

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:19.040
I would like to see an orb in the hotel room that's kind of my that's kind of my thoughts on that

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:25.520
but yeah I've had nothing weird besides death threats to be honest troll mama thank you so much

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:31.840
I really appreciate you thank you very much uh thank you so much last question we'll get to

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:35.520
or I guess more of a comment and I will see if we have one more if UFOs are real we find out

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:40.880
craze are real the boom abductions are real simple as that I can't argue with it um shows the TR3b

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:46.400
while you're at it too all right please all right guys with that we'll wrap up tonight uh I hope
