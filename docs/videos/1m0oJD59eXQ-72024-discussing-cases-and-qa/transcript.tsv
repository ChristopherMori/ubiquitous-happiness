0	2060	you
31000	34760	Okay, okay, I don't think I got anybody in here
40560	42560	Let's
42920	51140	See rewatching. Okay. Can you guys can anybody hear me? I'm trying to set this up. I'm still pretty pretty new to lives
54560	59500	Just trying to check this out, I think we got three
60880	62880	Okay, oh, what's up quitter? How you doing, man?
64760	68680	Okay, what's up guys? I'll wait I'm waiting for some people to join
69320	73000	But I just kind of wanted to chill with everybody for a little bit
73000	76240	I know we got some good videos out some interesting cases
76560	81320	I'm actually leaving tomorrow for a trip overseas. So I just kind of wanted to check in with everybody
82000	84000	See what everybody's working on
84000	88320	Kind of understand what cases you guys are looking at also when I get some more people in here
88320	92880	I wanted to get some book recommendations from everybody for my trip
93880	98120	Good a long plane ride to Japan. So thus far. Let me see what I got
99400	101400	Alexander I am going to Japan
101880	107220	So I'm doing a little trip to Tokyo and Kyoto tomorrow and it's really weird being on a live
107920	113480	Talking to myself. You're not talking to myself, but you know what I mean. So for books
114720	117440	I'm rereading Michael Schratz
119040	122480	Crash retrievals of the third kind if any of you guys have heard of that
122480	128200	It is where Schrat got to go through Leonard Stringfield's personal archives in Cincinnati at Mufon
128760	133120	And he touched on some cases that Stringfield had in the crash. Oh, what's up, Joey?
133600	136640	What up, Joey? Joey the trip is tomorrow to Japan
138240	140240	Okay, I want to I want to
141120	146160	Want to talk about that in a second off TV. I I also don't like flying. It's not my favorite
147120	154120	But so tomorrow guys for for some of the the books. I mean the day after Roswell. Is that by Bill Moore, Jason?
154120	156120	I think it is
156120	159280	Because if that's if that is in fact by Bill Moore
161000	162800	He also
162800	167960	You guys know the the Grant Cameron files right Grant Cameron released all of his files recently
168680	174920	Downloadable. He has a lot of contacts with Bill Moore. They had a email connection. This was back in I think
175440	183000	1998 and they were discussing the Kalahari Desert crash back in 89 in South Africa near the coast of Botswana and of course
183000	186680	the primary source for that is a little controversial with a
187840	192800	Guy who claimed he or to be claimed he was making up his South African Air Force credentials
192800	199320	But Bill Moore in these texts with Grant Cameron in these emails said he had a secondary source for the Kalahari Desert crash
199600	203680	So I want to link up with Bill more if I can because he is still living. He's very old
203680	209080	I think he was born in 42 and find out who that secondary source is because the how Kalahari crash is great
209080	210840	if you guys have ever seen the
210840	217200	The video from Mack Maeve and his channel got hacked is taken down. So but that's a great video for when it gets back up
217920	224160	UFO connections to Iceland such as crash retrievals or such brother. Yes. I was actually looking at this yesterday. There is a case
225200	231760	From the 50s if you look at magic eyes only I actually lived in Iceland for a little bit
232600	234600	Let me see if I can remember where this was
236760	238760	Okay, it was in the
239160	241960	Jukula rivers in August of 1954
242640	252640	According to Ryan S. Wood one of the primary sources here is the 468 CIC detachment document titles unidentified flying objects dated October 11th
253520	260160	1954 so oh, okay. Okay, Philip J. Corso. Yeah, that's the day after Roswell men. Yeah, I see what you're saying that
260640	265640	Corso is awesome. I I actually haven't sat down and fully read day after Roswell
265920	269880	Which I've only listened to bits and pieces or just kind of reference the book when I needed to
271400	278480	Are there any reports of UFOs around only nuclear warheads artillery or nuclear facilities in general such as well
278480	283840	I know that of course we have Malmstrom and this was with B 52 bombers
283840	288120	But in the 50 Monat AFB that is where I think a disc shape craft changed its
288560	294080	Its altitude in a very rapid session kind of flew around a descending B 52. That's not the case. I know
295200	300200	So well Jimmy shoo, thank you so much for the the $20. I really appreciate that
300840	307360	Recommend clear intent government cover-up of UFO. Okay guys, I'm gonna actually grab a piece of paper so I can write this down and
308840	310840	What?
310920	313280	Get that to that in a second. So
314000	315920	All right, also
315920	320240	above top secret by Timothy good. That's another good piece. I'm rereading tomorrow and
321600	328200	Since I will be meeting up with Ryan S. Wood soon. I'm rereading all of the MJ 12 files
329600	334080	Maybe can I send the link to the chat and yes, okay? Let me go through these. Sorry man
334120	338680	What is my background and how do I get access the informants that that I give?
339200	342240	So my background is mechanical engineering
343560	347120	Studied in university got my bachelors in mechanical engineering
348000	353480	Currently work in the field more less so mechanical engineering more so just kind of spreadsheets and so forth
353480	359480	but when I started my my channel everything initially started as kind of to
359840	364800	Talk to friends and family who had an interest in this subject. I was the guy who they had come to to speak to
365480	370720	But everything was so discombobulated even my files were just rancid and all over the place. So I started my channel
371160	376760	Well, how I got access to these informants was I didn't give a darn about
377200	383760	Who I called and who I tried to talk to if you guys remember back to the UFO witnesses and so forth
383760	386320	I would just like these guys like MS and TV
386320	392280	I just would call people and I would just talk to them. So I wouldn't really care what sort of situation it was in
392280	393480	I know that
393480	397380	Now it's not really the smartest idea just a cold call because you never know
397780	402060	Who's on the other side, but that is how just kind of brute force
402060	405740	I I know in this space a lot of people aren't really willing to kind of
406460	409660	Put themself if there is a firing line and a firing line
409980	411660	But that's how you do it man
411660	416580	It's with the the differences with Joey, of course because I made my video on
417180	422020	Marines who got close to you to UFOs with Herrera and Wagan and Joey reached out to me
422020	424140	So that was a difference in the case
424540	430540	No Matthew not high-key smart AF man college was super hard for me
430540	434300	The only classes I did really well in were Diffie Q
434940	442100	So it's roll mama. Thank you very much. I appreciate that quite a bit and that's a cute gopher or badger
442100	447140	Whatever it is so actually what what do you guys think about the MH370 videos?
447140	451420	I've tended to stay away from them for now just because I know there's a lot of drama around them
451420	456300	And especially because the videos kind of circulate mostly on Twitter and most the research is on Twitter
456300	460620	I know that there's a lot of weirdly enough drama in the UAP sphere on on Twitter
460780	464740	So that's not necessarily my go-to where I go to kind of look at cases
464740	469260	I know a lot of the time whenever I hop on Twitter. I see people in in rooms just kind of a
470740	475680	Like drama rooms or something like that. So if you guys want to talk about MH370, I'd love to hear it
476600	481360	Yeah, this is also a good question. I see a lot of people talking like
481860	488120	You know, how does a random youtuber talk to these people and that's a great question. I am a random youtuber
488480	490480	but I just think the
490560	492560	difference is like I I
492600	495780	Just try really hard to speak to people and
496960	502240	You know since starting the channel have been able to make some good connections and you know
502240	506720	Talk to some interesting people and kind of gain some respects and so forth. So
507360	512320	Like the the start of the channel right now. That's just the beginning. You know, I have my inspirations guys like cold heart
512880	517840	And so forth and you know, I would love to over time talk to higher profile whistleblowers
518560	520960	Talk to higher profile first-hand witnesses
521840	526480	Do more interviews that are more documentary style. I like that versus the traditional
526800	530400	I sit on stream yard. I guess it's on stream yard and we talk for two hours
531120	533680	In my opinion at least from like what I like to watch on youtube
533680	538080	I'm far more interested if an interview has sort of a narrative or documentary around it
538800	541920	I know that's the case. I'm going to be doing with ryan s wood. Um
542880	546640	Because I really want to do justice to mj12
547200	550800	And I'm faced with a couple options right like make a 30 to 50 minute video
550800	554560	Just talking about the documents relaying like each line basically to
554960	558160	actual events that have occurred in history or talk to ryan wood
558720	563040	Who is kind of as much of an expert as you can possibly get to mj12?
563440	569040	And especially his dad who was a private aerospace contractor who started the majestic documents with mr. Wood and so forth
569040	575920	So I like that a lot. Read the book that tim taylor wrote zack. That's actually a great idea. I'm going to write that down too
578000	583920	Um, and I've heard that as as well. Uh, sorry, I'm just I'm just writing this down from zack real fast
583920	585920	I
587680	592320	Okay, that's a that's this is a great question. So the essence of mj12 is
592880	596080	Back in the 80s. I can't remember if it was 82 87 or
596640	600720	What exactly it was but there was a role of documents mailed to some, uh,
601920	603920	ufologists such as
604480	606880	such as stan freedman and these are
607600	613840	The mj12 documents the mj12 purports an organization within the usg established under truman handed to
613920	617920	Eisenhower that basically was formed a little bit before
618640	624080	Ross well because there are references to the interplanetary phenomenon unit, which is actually really interesting
624080	626080	there's actually two references there's a
626480	632160	A case protocol for the ipu in mj12 and there's another kind of like nine page guidelines
632160	633840	I'll actually maybe in
633840	639600	The the discord post that but so there's references to the ipu and of course the ipu the interplanetary phenomenon unit
639600	640880	I know I
640880	645040	Glanced by that my last video. I'm actually probably going to explore that in the different topic like two
645520	648640	Three letter agencies that are kind of unknown in another video coming soon
649280	656320	The ipu was referenced so the mj12 purports the original crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that operated with banna bar bush
656960	659280	Robert j. Oppenheimer even albert einstein
660080	662800	And the thing is these were all labeled hoax by fbi
664240	666560	You know if you look at mj12 documents and you look at this
666640	670640	I think it's the cia root reading room. You'll just see bogus written across the documents
671520	674160	There are hundreds if not thousands of mj12 documents
674640	680800	All talking about protocol like the somo one the special operations manual about what to do when a crash team finds biologics to
681200	688480	A craft to operational protocol to just discussing cases like the isenhower briefing document in 53 that discusses the 1950
689200	691200	El indio del Rio case and so forth
691200	697520	So basically the mj12 is the biggest question of are there legitimate documents?
697760	703440	Recorded in the public realm for the crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that dates back to the mid 40s
704240	708240	And that's just the simple answer. There's so much more to get into there's so much intrigue
708560	712640	So many of the classic ufologists stanton freedmen lennard stringfield bill more
714080	715680	Grant cameron
715680	718240	All these guys have talked so much about mj12
718960	723520	So I could keep talking about mj12 forever, but we'll say that probably we'll see
724800	728640	But the the the thing is philippe
730960	734240	If I want to see results in this field
734720	736480	I got to be willing to
736480	738480	kind of do the hard work that
739040	741040	a lot of people don't want to do and
741200	746080	You know to to what ends who knows dangerous, maybe I don't know but
746880	749920	This is subject is just too important to me to kind of
750880	758000	Play the safe road and I appreciate you watched everything. Thank you. It's a ton of great videos coming up, man
758080	763200	A ton. I'm really excited. I can't wait to get back in japan the council boys
764320	767520	Uh, oh, I think I know who it is. Thank you for the euro's brother
767600	771760	Hopefully you're able to go to the manchester card next week
772400	775040	If you are let me know because that actually sounds awesome
775040	777440	And I'm going to be really jealous except you'll have to be up at like 4 a.m
778400	785520	Great job on the recent videos random question. Have you given any thoughts of the alleged Costa Rica sightings in 1971 and the 2007 razor photo?
785840	791120	Yeah, actually the 71 photo if I sorry, let me get a sip of my gate or powerade
793520	797920	If I'm uh, correct here the 1971 photograph was taken from a
798640	802880	geographical coastal mapping plane and it depicts a classic saucer from an elevation of
803840	805840	Between 10 to 25 000 feet
806160	809920	That's a classic picture. I know it's been referenced a lot by people like uh, linda moulton
810000	812240	I think linda moulton howl but and so forth
812640	817520	Or sorry leslie keen. I'm sorry, but that is interesting. So is the razor video
817680	821360	It's really hard to do an analysis on the razor video because there's so few
821920	823920	Frans in which we see the craft
824080	826880	And I know so so if you guys don't know what the razor video is
827120	834080	It's supposedly a costa rica video of a saucer shaped uap taken in 2007 off a flip phone think a motorola razor
834560	837680	This depicts a craft sitting in kind of like a cavern
838160	844480	Resting resting resting quickly the camera shows the craft go belly up like bob lasar describes and fly off
844880	848560	Now the the big kind of drama here is people asking if
849120	853200	A little laxative pain. I didn't even notice that but oh you commented last time and max pain's a great game
853200	855200	Especially mass max pain three
855200	861520	But so that the the big controversy around that video is some people surmise that the craft is just something suspended on a string
861520	867520	And that's sort of the the jerking motion. So that requires some analysis, but it's it's tried to um
868320	870320	It's it's difficult to to study that
871040	873040	Edward lin
873920	878160	I have actually not heard of Edward lin. I'll be completely honest
878240	880240	So if you can tell me who that is
880480	882160	I'd love to know
882160	885760	Big fan of your efforts. Thank you very much. I appreciate that
886560	887440	just
887440	890960	Trying to have everything I do that I can be open source and
891520	894560	You know have the documents for everybody to read themselves and so forth
894560	896880	I think in the future, I'll probably make a website just because
897600	901440	Over time the cases get a lot more complicated and I reference a lot more
902080	905840	So I'd like to have a website with each case log. Maybe a transcript of the video
906560	911280	Maybe some snippets like when I reference a clip like David grush talking on jre because
911760	916080	You know, if I want to hear David grush talk about stargate, I can only have 30 seconds of footage before I might get
916400	917840	My butt hit with copyright
917840	923520	So I'd love to have that stuff on a website where there can be a little bit more context to add it in for people who prefer to
924640	926240	read
926240	930880	What's your opinion on whether or not humans can handle disclosure? This is actually a very good question
930880	932880	I think about this all the time
933040	935040	I oftentimes like to say yes
936240	939760	But you know, what exactly are the uh implications of of
940480	945520	Disclosure there's already so much negative discourse in the uap sphere in general and how people look at this topic
946240	950400	Uh, sometimes I have to step aside because you know, everybody I talk to are
950880	955120	The fine folks who watch my channel and so forth everybody who has an interest in uap
955680	960400	Who likes to study uap who has a pretty good case log in their brains of cases
960480	963680	But you know when I'm at jujitsu and people come up to me with it
963680	967520	Hey, you get you have that ufo youtube channel, right and they start talking it
967920	970320	I think the average person the public just thinks
970960	974800	Even they're still on the the question of are ufo is real, right?
975520	976720	so
976720	982640	When the vast majority of an american populace is just still asking the question if ufos are real
983200	985200	I'm not exactly sure how
985680	987680	Well, a populace could handle the
988240	991520	Kind of looming presence of a non-human intelligence on this planet
991600	997920	So it's a multi-layered question like we could probably talk about this for hours and hours, but i'm not sure
998640	1002160	Uh, what's going on with the skinwalker ranch having the presentation or something wilder side?
1002240	1004720	I'm actually going to talk to jesse michael's about this. Um
1005680	1009360	I have talked to him a little bit about it because he spent some time at skinwalker ranch
1009920	1012880	I don't think he saw I don't think he said he saw anything weird
1012880	1017920	But I think he said he experienced like just kind of weird poltergeist phenomena as people call it
1017920	1021040	So I need to talk a little more about that, but it is
1022080	1028720	Rather funny with dr. Shawn Kirkpatrick that image from 2018. He looks like a kid who got his hand caught in the candy jar
1028720	1030720	Does he not he is glaring
1031600	1034880	Glaring at the camera. I've never seen a man look so furious. So
1035680	1041840	You guys know my opinion on dr. S. K. I've made videos or made that video a long time about him
1041840	1044240	And since then there's only more to discuss
1045040	1050320	And so forth. Why does this subject interest you so much? Have you ever had an experience possibly jason?
1050400	1054480	I've possibly had an experience just like everybody. I've seen weird lights in the sky things make
1055120	1058080	Making turns at 90 degree angles zigzagging across the sky
1058320	1061680	But I cannot say concretely that i've seen a definite form of a craft
1062400	1064160	I've talked about this a little bit this subject
1064160	1070000	It has been my primary interest since I was old enough to read one of my first ever books was a book on the betty and barney hill incident
1070000	1073360	I remember reading that when I was basically in diapers
1074720	1075680	and
1075680	1076720	I just
1076720	1080160	This topic is so weird to me because of the abundance of
1080800	1087360	information cases documents testimonies to kind of immerse yourself in
1088160	1093600	But the vile reaction people have back to discount. This is just a common conspiracy. So
1094400	1101040	I think what really interested me first was just the the idea of contemplating UFOs and then
1101600	1106160	The amount of evidence for that juxtaposed with the stigma that has been created. So
1107680	1114880	When I first started my channel, I was mostly interested in just kind of creating a pretty comprehensive database of cases and footage
1115440	1120960	For people to reference but as I move on I'm more interested in actually doing whatever the heck I can to
1121920	1127280	Help disclosure, however, I can in any way I can do that, you know, it's tough. I'm not a military guy. I'm not a
1128320	1130000	politician but
1130000	1132000	Yeah, so I figured my route
1132000	1135680	uh, just like some people before me like Ross could be through journalism and
1136240	1141920	Just trying to inform the public tell herms. Yes, I do and in just a few minutes. I will drop the link in the
1143680	1145680	In the chat
1146240	1149360	Mighty moh, thank you so much. It's okay that you're late to the party
1149440	1152480	You haven't missed too much. We're just kind of talking through questions just chatting
1153120	1154080	um
1154080	1155600	and
1155600	1158640	I would like do you have any book recommendations for me for my trip to japan?
1159280	1160000	um
1160000	1165680	So you can email me at uapgurb at gmail.com. I'm a little bit behind on emails just with how busy I've been
1165680	1167680	So i'm also going to be doing that on the plane
1167920	1174320	Again, that's uapgurb at gmail.com or I will post my discord invite here in a couple minutes
1174880	1176560	fat rodents
1176560	1180160	Subs we need to keep gerbs gerbs producing
1180960	1182000	comment
1182000	1188080	He just said he's a mechanical engineer by day job. Keep him producing. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the support
1189440	1192000	I'm just wondering I had an nde tell me about that
1192000	1194480	I you know the the more you immerse yourself in this
1194800	1199760	Phenomenon kind of the more interesting and the more you move outside the traditional nuts and bolts of fields to study
1199760	1201760	So I'd like to hear about that
1201760	1206080	What are your thoughts on grush being so quiet recently? I do not think that he's not that it's
1206720	1208000	I
1208000	1210400	I do not think that it's because of laziness or
1211520	1219600	Not interest. I think that the best avenues for for grush to affect change right now is probably doing stuff behind the scenes
1221840	1223840	This in my opinion has probably worked with
1224480	1226480	congress lawmakers
1226720	1228400	and so forth I
1228400	1233520	I think he he did what he needed to do in the public with his ross colt hart news nation interview
1234000	1237920	His appearance on jesse michael's and his j re appearance. I
1238800	1243200	I mean in those besides his op-ed, which I still do believe is is on the way
1243760	1244720	um
1244720	1246080	He's pretty much
1246080	1252800	Talked about everything he can publicly, right? So I think the the mostly what he's doing is behind the scenes kona
1253440	1258880	Please email me at uap grow about gmail.com if you have and I haven't responded. I'm just a little bit behind because
1259520	1261520	So dang much going on
1261520	1265680	And thanks before I continue. Thank you guys so much for asking questions and chatting
1266160	1267520	um
1267520	1272400	I really appreciate it and I love talking everybody. I'm trying to get through every single one of these because I'm very honored
1273840	1276240	Pitchforks are coming 30 years and millions of reports later
1276240	1280960	I hunter believe that they have been here since the dawn of mankind. I don't need anyone to approve what I believe
1281440	1283440	I like that mindset more and more
1283920	1287920	Grush has talked about this as well and many other people talk about the antiquity
1288400	1292320	Of the phenomenon, you know, you have the 16th century nuremberg lights
1292880	1296400	With all sorts of shapes dancing around the skies of nuremberg triangles
1297040	1300480	weird crescent shaped craft and so forth
1301440	1303440	all throughout history like the uh
1303760	1307680	I'm trying to remember like the chariots of juda back in the 11th century in a in a
1308960	1310960	Middle eastern war
1310960	1315360	If bob lasar is to be believed one of these craft was found during an archaeological dig
1316160	1317920	Many people who
1317920	1322880	Have a good basis of of credibility to stand on talk about this phenomenon being ancient
1323600	1325600	And I certainly would probably agree
1326320	1327680	patrick
1327680	1331280	Have I looked into emory smith? I have not i'm going to write that name down because
1332960	1334960	Any sort of
1335200	1338320	Uh investigation I haven't done I would love to do
1339040	1343120	Everyone comment on this defeat the algorithm. Thank you op tv. I appreciate that too
1343200	1346960	I I just you know, if I if I need help, I'll reach out to the community. I know
1347600	1351120	I talked about this in the last video, but I I wish I could get content out faster
1352160	1354400	It you know, I like
1355360	1357600	I want the creative process to be mine
1357600	1363600	So I do everything from thinking of the idea to researching to writing the script to filming to editing to posting
1363600	1366800	So I appreciate the patience with all this and you know, if I need some
1367680	1371680	If I if if I need to reach out to people I absolutely will what can the average
1372400	1381600	Working joe due to legitimize the subject more. That's a great question. I mean, um, what I would say personally is to familiarize yourself with factual data
1383520	1386560	Understand the usg's history and studying the uap phenomenon
1387280	1393600	Understand project grudge signed blue book the controversy around osap and atyp uap tf and aro
1394320	1400160	Talk about the unknown unknowns. All of these programs have registered the obfuscation of data the stigma
1401120	1406000	And when you bring up this subject at least what I'd like to do in public is not just to
1406800	1410560	Jump to okay. There's non-human intelligence on this planet
1411040	1414960	There's reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs, but it's just say wait slow down for a second
1415520	1418160	People are still arguing about our ufo is real
1418720	1422720	Well, here's how the u.s. Government has studied ufo since the 1940s
1423200	1427840	And then you can reference the condom report not the 1969 out of cu boulder condom report
1427840	1432000	But I somebody told me I said this wrong conding condom
1432560	1438560	The british mod ufo study that actually referenced the 1989 uh belgian ufo wave of triangles
1439360	1443520	You can also talk about all the australian ufo reports if you're interested in that
1443600	1445600	I think it's my us over d1
1445760	1449760	I linked to the internet archive where I referenced a couple australian
1450400	1452400	uso reports there's a full archive there
1453120	1458880	And then you can talk about canadian uh lawmakers talking about five eyes nation studying ua uap together. So
1459440	1461440	I would just talk about
1462080	1463920	stick to
1463920	1468000	Introducing people to get comfortable with the fact that ufos aren't just a conspiracy
1468560	1472720	Because the stigma has been so dang success successful at doing that
1473760	1478400	Um, yes, sir jujitsu and mixed martial arts. I love jujitsu
1478560	1480560	Uh, I had training today
1481360	1485040	I might have got a little bit of a concussion because I was doing technique with a youngster
1485120	1490480	He was trying to do a fireman's carry threw me over the back shoulder hit the head a little bit. So hopefully it's okay
1491920	1493920	Thank you. I appreciate that
1493920	1497600	I think disclosure will cause the ontological shock we've heard about to religious people
1498480	1505360	But non-religious people it's an easy pill to swallow. Uh, I've actually I've liked how the vatican has handled
1506320	1512080	Uh discussing this topic in the last couple of years talking about I think they said that god paints with a broad brush
1512960	1518720	You had a catholic priests at the uh last july congressional hearings with grush
1519600	1520880	so
1520880	1526800	I hope I like I hope non-religious people can handle this but at the same time, you know, what are
1527280	1529280	how's the average person going to
1529760	1533680	Just react in general when they find out that there is a presence on this planet that
1534320	1541120	Operates completely different to humans their modus operandi probably still not given out if there's full disclosure why they're here is unknown
1541440	1546400	How many of them are unknown where they're coming from unknown? Just kind of the fact that they're here. Um
1547120	1549120	Yes, I do know who mitiokaku is
1549680	1554640	Uh, I would love to speak to him if you have a way to talk to him. I would really like to talk to him
1554640	1556880	I have a book of his I can't remember what it's called
1556960	1561840	But I've always really enjoyed his appearances on j re uh talking about the phenomenon
1563280	1564720	They've been here
1564720	1568720	Pitchfork, they've been here forever. Nothing will change. I hope I hope that's not the case
1570960	1576320	We are at a pretty pivotal pivotal point in disclosure. I think there's been a couple times where
1577280	1579280	there has been
1580640	1582640	We've been pretty close to
1583040	1586160	Sort of disclosure events, but then moved away for various reasons
1587840	1590160	So I hope things can change now
1590320	1595920	It partly feels like the genie's a bit out of the bottle with people like grush coming out and so much kind of attention on the
1595920	1598240	UAP subject. I know it's still a little niche
1598960	1604960	After all the the excitement died down from the congressional hearings, but let's let's hope with the 2024 ndaa
1605680	1611840	Um, we can continue that. So how do you rationalize what custodian? I don't know who custodian file
1612560	1614560	Or uh, I don't know who custodian file is
1615280	1617280	So please tell me if you can
1618320	1620480	This is a great question on a sliding scale
1621200	1627840	How confident are you that michael herrera is telling the truth? This is so michael's such an interesting case for me to talk about because like
1629520	1637200	With the stuff that joey always talks about kind of the extra evidence that michael has of talking to the insider and so forth
1637840	1642560	It really is one of the most compelling pieces and I can tell you
1643280	1648800	I had a really weird moment where I actually came across this insider
1649920	1651920	completely independently
1653440	1655440	In my own research on another project
1655840	1662160	So that was really kind of weird for me. And no this insider is not anybody i've i've ever covered on the channel
1662160	1667680	I think somebody commented recently on youtube was uh, the witness i recently spoke to was he michael's insider
1668000	1670000	and no he was not but
1670080	1671840	I am
1671920	1673920	Of course, you can't prove
1673920	1675920	Indonesia although although
1677040	1678560	although
1678560	1684000	I am talking or I need to set up a call with somebody who may have some interesting information on
1684640	1690800	On indonesia back in 2009. So there's an individual. I haven't been able to connect with him yet because i've been so busy, but
1691600	1696640	I'd like to talk to him. He says he has something interesting to talk to me about the sliding scale on the high side, brother
1697120	1703600	Love the idea of the website. It would be a lot easier. Yes. Also. What is the best way to help support the efforts?
1703600	1704880	Of course, like
1704880	1706640	So I have I have a patreon
1706640	1707360	I'm not going to continue
1707360	1711040	I'm not going to advertise it too much until I feel like I have a wealth of content that can keep somebody
1711520	1717760	Busy for hours hours on end or until I'm able to get like a weekly live stream and so forth where we can discuss cases and so forth
1717760	1722480	So uh for now if you would watch the videos and share them I that would be
1723680	1725920	I would love it. I would love it. That would mean everything to me
1727440	1730080	To people who can't think past that are they going to invade us?
1730960	1733200	Yeah, I think a lot of that
1733920	1738640	I always think back to the twilight zone episode to serve man or the invading alien force
1740000	1741520	eats people
1741520	1743040	so
1743040	1744880	Yeah, the the question of invasion
1744960	1750880	I hope just because that's been so discussed by hollywood with films like independence day mars attack and so forth
1750880	1756160	I I hope people can start to move past the idea of being invaded by an ny species because
1756640	1758640	people always like to talk about the moniker if
1759600	1765520	If they wanted to invade us they already would have so I I I struggle to kind of wrap my head around that but at the same time, you know
1766160	1771760	Uh non-human intelligence. It's almost impossible to attribute motives to something that doesn't possibly has
1772720	1777360	No relation to human consciousness or synapses. I don't know. That's a it's an interesting question
1778240	1784480	In his latest interview that came out the other day sk tried to play the skinwalker ranch presentation down even more you can
1785440	1787440	Yeah, ever since that, um
1788560	1790560	fugal came up with that photo
1790640	1791680	so
1791680	1796480	Remember green street had that basement office episode or not it. Sorry. I'm sorry
1797440	1803440	He had the interview part two with sk right and that was moved back like a full week or two
1803520	1806960	I I sincerely think that episode was moved back
1807360	1814000	Slowly to do damage control on that photo because the entire second interview was just talking about how sk
1814000	1816000	Didn't know about that presentation
1816320	1821040	And he was kind of blindsided by it and he was just asked to be a consultant on it. So yeah
1823520	1829120	Sk as the kids would say he's kind of a dweeb whether we can handle the disclosure or not is irrelevant
1829120	1834800	If people believe gravity, it's better to warn them not to jump off a cliff. I yeah, I I am one for
1835360	1841440	Kind of what guys like rush a that they're still oversight necessary if there are retrieval
1842160	1844320	and uh reverse engineering programs
1845120	1853200	I think rush at it. I just rewatched his jre interview. He said that nuclear physics are available to study in an undergraduate course
1853680	1856960	But the mechanics of making a nuclear weapon are classified
1857520	1858400	I
1858400	1864160	Like to think in that ran the same realm of thought around uap still humans and the general public deserve
1864240	1866240	Disclosure about what is visiting our planet
1867120	1871520	Possibly where they come from and how they operate. It's their their modus operandi if it's known
1872080	1878160	But if still technology needs to be kept away because of various potentials of it. I still understand
1879760	1885040	The public was yeah, um, I grush talked about this as well. Um, kind of
1886640	1890640	For a forgiveness window for people who may have committed blue collar crime
1891360	1896000	In program duties, whether that be, you know, hiding away funds racketeering embezzlement
1896800	1898400	bribery
1898400	1899680	threats
1899680	1901840	anything he says when it comes down to the harm and
1902480	1904800	Possible murders that people need to be locked up an ab
1905440	1907120	Absolutely, if people have
1907120	1911360	affected human lives and ended them in for this subject. Yes, they do
1912880	1914880	Have you heard of
1914880	1917520	Daniel Salter alien contact intelligence?
1918240	1920240	No, I haven't I'm gonna write that down
1920960	1922960	Daniel
1923760	1925840	Salter I'll check that out, man. I've never heard of it
1926560	1931360	Do you have any posts? I do not yet. I'm still there are a lot of investigations. I'm trying to work on now
1931840	1933120	in the future
1933120	1938400	Kind of I'd like to start talking about kind of a ongoing case logs in the in the patreon
1940000	1944400	So have you ever looked into the connection between ny and psychedelics such as dmt?
1944480	1948320	No, I have not the only thing I know because I have a memory like a hawk
1948880	1950000	Um
1950000	1952880	Is alex jones in 2017 on jre
1953600	1956240	talking about various government organizations using
1956880	1961280	Dmt to connect with some sort of non human intelligence in the spirit realm. I have not
1961920	1965840	I know that I have some family members who have experimented with dmt
1966000	1970880	And I know some of the stuff they have seen is wild in terms of just uh kind of leaving
1971680	1973680	Not really existing in the human
1974320	1978000	Realm of thought anymore. So no, I haven't looked into that but it's very interesting
1980720	1987200	If they're able to travel to this this planet at will that they probably probably do, um, how you been I have been
1988320	1989840	Amazing
1989840	1993040	Thank you very much. If anybody's kind of new to the stream
1993440	1996640	I'm doing this because tomorrow I am taking a trip out of the country
1997120	2000160	So I just wanted to chat with everybody because of course I won't be able to get a video out
2000240	2003120	But I have a lot of projects coming back. I actually might
2004640	2006640	See what people want to see first
2008800	2010800	So on the agenda is
2011440	2014880	I want to do a video on the interplanetary phenomenon unit combined with another
2015760	2018480	Very shadowy unit that might be a little interesting to cover
2019280	2022160	I want to do a video on the kalahari incident if I can talk to bill more
2022480	2027040	Of course, I need to get to kexburg. That's one of the biggest ones the 1941 cape gerudo crash
2027520	2029520	I want to talk about scalar technologies
2030000	2032000	um, I want to talk about
2032960	2039040	Ryan wood and the mj-12 and I might also be meeting doing a little trip with uh, mr. Jesse michael's
2040080	2042080	Maybe we can collaborate on a video
2042240	2044240	That'd be awesome. I would love to do that
2045200	2048480	So you've shown evidence where hundreds of millions are allocated to black programs
2048480	2052720	But that's chump change for something like this. How can you explain the disparity?
2053280	2055280	yeah, I think that um
2055920	2061600	I think that I've just pointed out in some videos like a small number of contracts just to start kind of
2062720	2068080	illustrating a point in terms of especially when contracts are allocated where employees of various companies have said that
2068400	2072080	These large contracts don't have any kind of movement within them
2072640	2075920	And so forth. I know that kathryn austin fits in the 1990s
2076240	2081840	Who talks about the gao failed on it by the pentagon talks about billions upon billions upon billions missing in funds
2081840	2085040	So I just tackle this at a smaller scale, you know
2085120	2088800	Even I can't really conceptualize the billions and billions of billions that go into black programs
2088800	2095440	That are kind of unaccounted for so I just like to analyze from like a small small contract by contract basis and so forth
2095840	2099200	Uh, how do you make sure that you don't fall down the rabbit hole too much?
2099200	2101360	And I'm sure you keep grounded but still open to new data
2101840	2106000	That's actually probably one of the best questions I heard. I I know of of course a couple
2107040	2112240	YouTubers and so forth who cover this topic who have just kind of like struggled. Um, you know, like
2112960	2116560	Studying this so much can have adverse mental health effects
2116800	2120800	I've seen and not just from youtubers but from authors and so forth. So
2121600	2123600	To stay grounded. I think
2123840	2127920	One needs to have a life outside of uh studying uap and for me that is
2128720	2133120	Of course jujitsu, uh, my lovely girlfriend traveling
2134000	2137840	You know, you can be immersed in a rabbit hole. You want the second you go, uh,
2138400	2142240	Somebody tries to strangle you be kind of snap out a bit and are able to stay a little bit grounded
2142240	2143280	but
2143280	2146800	I think part of the the biggest thing now to kind of get trapped with the kind of
2147360	2150960	Misinformation and so forth is to really take my time to digest what I'm hearing
2151440	2157760	And to see how much of new information I can cross reference to existing cases existing documents existing
2158400	2160400	kind of knowledge out there
2160560	2166720	The vetting process in this field is so hard. There's so much misinformation so much misinformation that
2167520	2169520	You know, just got to do the best we can
2170560	2172080	treading very carefully
2172080	2176720	It seems plausible that psychedelics remove our filters that keep us from seeing paranormal phenomena
2177280	2180000	Yeah, so my family members who are actually into psychedelics
2180720	2182720	have talked about like the
2183360	2185840	Brain being a tuner for for human consciousness
2185840	2188480	So I'm trying to remember what they said they talk about how a brain is
2188800	2192400	essentially a tuner for human consciousness and on the psychedelics that
2192640	2193760	uh
2193760	2199520	More information is is taken in by your your filter your brain which it lets you exist in three dimensions
2199600	2203200	I'm trying to think this this still kind of new territory for me as you guys know
2203200	2205760	I'm not always try to be really honest about that. Um
2206560	2209280	Kind of a big nuts and bolts guys so still trying to learn trying to
2209840	2212880	Kind of understand some of those mysteries of consciousness and so forth a little more
2213840	2218000	Uh cracker jack. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I will use this to
2218720	2222640	Train for two days at Kodokan judo in tokyo. So I appreciate that
2224080	2228800	LC the d.o.t. Can't account for half a test is trillions worth of assets. Yeah, trill. Yeah
2230000	2231200	Please
2231200	2235600	Uh, do a video that covers thomas beardan and ning lee. I've heard both of these names before are they
2236640	2241440	associated with ning lee. I'm trying to remember. Let me know but I I absolutely will
2242960	2247040	Do you think the story about the good guys versus the bad guys inside the program is a form of diff's information
2247040	2250480	So people uh thread water loose focus researching dead ends
2251840	2253440	uh
2253440	2255440	I'm not sure. Uh, I
2256800	2261440	Logistically within a these programs like this it would make sense of kind of
2262160	2264880	Interfactionalities and so forth people who advocate for disclosure
2265760	2269440	And people who kind of want to keep the the the lid on disclosure
2270320	2272320	um
2272320	2276880	So that's actually a really good question. I I'm just trying to think of how I can best frame my
2277280	2279280	answer
2280080	2284000	Uh, do you good guys versus bad guys a form of disinformation? I
2285200	2290400	I don't necessarily just due to the amount of first hand people who have come out and
2290960	2296720	Just said the same thing that there are many elements within programs who will almost stop at nothing to
2297520	2301840	Prevent any sort of of disclosure from from popping out. I know that answer is not great
2301840	2305040	But I actually want to think a little bit harder on giving an exact
2305520	2307760	Reasoning for that question because that's a great question
2308720	2314160	Grush was busted for at least three years. Yes, this is absolutely true interviewing 40 plus people
2314720	2316720	Years of research and data acquisition
2316880	2320080	Um, Colt Hart knows where one is at. Yes, he does
2321600	2326960	I would love to know where that giant thing is buried. I would love to know but I understand why he can't talk about it
2328560	2330560	I'm very excited for imminent. I have a
2331520	2336720	Copy pre-ordered. I'm really excited to to read it really looking forward and anything Dolan puts out
2337360	2341920	I think we can all agree Dolan's one of the best of the best anything Dolan puts out is is so worth reading
2342720	2348240	Jeff if we've known that nha exists. We have acquired in reverse engineered off-world technologies for 70 years
2348960	2355200	Why would we be wasting billions looking for microbes on mars or searching for exoplanets? This is assuming that uh various
2356160	2360560	agencies like nasa the the the main components are aware of reverse engineering
2361040	2363040	programs if you go by some of the
2363360	2367440	The discussions that have been talked about these programs are so sequestered away and compartmentalized
2368480	2372400	Very very very very few people kind of under understand what's going on
2372720	2375760	um, and that would kind of be uh, my realm of thought
2376400	2379600	Is that if technology has been successfully reverse engineered?
2379600	2386640	It's not like your mission directors at nasa or or funders on congressional staff for nasa are exactly aware of kind of what's going on
2388000	2390640	I think the uap updates are like waiting
2392240	2394800	Give me elder sorals elder scroll six, please
2395760	2399440	Please because starfield uh was not great
2400720	2405840	Have I seen the infographic show about the strange encounters? Yes or or uh not on
2405840	2411760	Big foot stuff or squash to be honest. I've never really looked into any like cryptid stuff
2412320	2418880	My mind has always been on uap. However. I think I've watched uh, of course everybody knows the the youtuber wendig you
2418880	2423360	And I think I've watched this uh cryptid iceberg a few times and of course that's great, but I've never actually done any
2423840	2426160	Uh serious research into that
2426720	2431040	That's not my uh, that's not my realm of of of study
2431920	2437200	Put a lot of weight work. The weight has always been I appreciate that. Uh, hopefully to to stay on that path everything
2437760	2439760	that I put out will have research and um
2440480	2442480	Ashing behind it
2442480	2446000	Yes, actually I will do something on this. I know I'm a bit late the kona blue
2446960	2453120	Deserves one of those dives where we go in line by line, especially just because it's it's such an interesting, um
2454080	2457680	Program proposal and how it relates to big low aerospace and so forth
2458240	2460240	How do I ask question?
2460240	2462240	Amog you can just um
2462560	2464560	You can just write it out here and
2465360	2468400	Yeah, you just did. Yeah, just say anything and I will respond
2469040	2475200	Conden report us condyne. Thank you. Yeah, I I get flak all the time, but I I can't pronounce most words
2475280	2477280	it's just because uh
2477760	2479520	I don't really know how to talk
2479520	2482240	Ecology, welcome. Welcome very much
2483360	2489680	Respect your that's a cute guinea pig bgj and ma martial arts. Thank you very much. You're a cool, dude. Um
2490960	2497680	Back in dc. I'd like to go to dc. Of course, there's so many people out there. I'd like to talk to um
2498400	2500400	And just meet with so if I ever am I'll let you know
2501440	2504800	The vatican knows something they have history locked away, which means maybe it's for a good reason
2505200	2508640	Yeah, if you go by grush speaking about the 1933 magenta case
2509280	2512960	information upon the crash uap was back channeled to the us by pope
2514240	2516720	I can't remember but by the sitting pope at the time
2517600	2518560	um
2518560	2522240	The best way to de-stigmatize is just to have conversations about what people think on the topic
2522400	2526720	I often just mentioned how our government is crafting legislation. I think that's a great point. Yes
2527200	2529840	Talked to the 2023 2024 and ea a
2530400	2535760	Um just these sort of conversations where you know people immediately want to jump to aliens and craft or ufo's real
2535760	2538720	Just kind of slowing down and say hey wait. These are the facts so far
2538720	2541520	I think that's really important land and I think that's a great point
2542080	2546960	The powers that be are making panic moves. I sure as heck hope
2547600	2552720	The panic moves if they are doing it aren't too uh jarring because that could lead to some danger
2553760	2557600	When you see one at under 24 feet, you don't need oh tell tell me about that experience
2557760	2562880	I'd love to hear that that sounds like an as close of an enclosed encounter as you can get
2564160	2567200	I've had many people come forward about something they've heard or read about the topic
2567200	2572800	Yeah, yeah kind of once people understand that you take this topic seriously and once they can understand
2572800	2577600	They don't really have to be embarrassed most people will will tell you a story they had like I had a guy at
2578000	2581120	Jiu Jitsu this was a couple weeks ago once he found out about my channel he came up to me
2581120	2584400	He said you know what I like I was biking in new york back in the early 90s
2584400	2590480	And a huge triangle flew over my dad and the uh, so it's just really interesting the the stories these people tell
2592400	2597200	Phone cameras i'm not so sure about that if phone cameras don't seem to be too good at capturing much
2598160	2603120	The dolce base is real or disinfo that is a really good question. I'm not so I'm not sure
2603120	2606720	It seems like there's a little bit too much known about uh, dolce
2607360	2613920	You know there seems to be a bit too much publicly available. I'm trying to remember the uh, the ufo highway ebook by
2614800	2621120	Crap what's his name? I can't remember but who interviews colonel x who talks about everything in dolce
2621520	2624480	Maybe dolce is a red herring. Who knows? Uh, it's
2625200	2628240	It's a tough question. I sir. I don't have enough
2629360	2631840	Knowledge on dolce to have a really informed
2632400	2633440	opinion
2633440	2637040	No, I think birdie asked this too last time with tim taylor. No, it is not
2638960	2641120	Unless you have the phone. Yeah, that's true. Okay, uh
2641920	2644240	Road pirate films custodian file is a channel on youtube
2644240	2650160	He posts videos and records from cameras he had on his roof and he often captures videos objects following planes and helicopters
2650320	2652720	Oh, I'd like to check that out. That actually sounds really interesting
2652880	2656480	I'd like to look at that footage. I don't watch uh, too much footage anymore
2657040	2662720	I know that I've covered uh, two footage cases mostly. I just kind of skate documents and
2663120	2667920	And so forth a footage isn't my number one focus right now, but I I would like to
2668880	2673280	To to keep going on that. Sorry. Some sightings are literally five to ten seconds
2673760	2678960	For leaving. Yeah, love twilight zone twilight zone is great, man. If you've watched the original 50s twilight zone
2679600	2681600	fantastic Ben
2682560	2684560	One of the contracts you mentioned
2684880	2688800	loved one thing I wanted to mention is that a lot of the contracts you mentioned may be
2689280	2693440	Availability public to research. Yeah, but the internal investors as
2694320	2698640	SAIC sites took down all those those contracts, but in my video notes
2698640	2701600	I do have secondary public places where you can read about those
2702240	2706480	Contracts. Sorry, I should have said that in the video. I'm sorry, but for each contract that has been taken down
2706560	2709280	I have different links that are still publicly available to look at them
2709760	2714400	Sighting lasted tell me about your setting to pitchforks. I'd love to hear about it
2716400	2720880	If they wanted to invade us they would have done it, uh, so this uh, yeah
2722720	2725360	Not nukes and launching rockets into space
2726320	2728000	Ethan, what do you say brother?
2728000	2733360	Too funny was just watching your precious videos in your live great investigation. Really interesting to see more
2734080	2737600	But I don't know if that's that's fear. I that was I don't know
2737680	2743040	But the Ross coldheart video with that sphere is really interesting. Yeah, I've watched bits and pieces of this
2743120	2747920	This was a really great interview. I'm not familiar with the engaging the phenomenon host
2748480	2753120	But you know, if if anybody is close to him tell him that that was awesome. That was a really great video
2753120	2755120	It was uh, I think that
2755760	2761120	Semivans quote that's making the rounds about the phenomenon the truth to it being indigestible is really interesting
2761680	2765600	There is a new interview with shonkirk patrick from news nation
2765600	2771760	You know, I thought after the steven green street interview that shonkirk patrick wasn't doing more interviews. So
2772560	2776000	Why why is he doing another interview torum and
2776960	2778960	okay
2779440	2784000	I think sk is a trained intelligence officer if he can't get away with plain dumb and intentionally not looking at things
2784000	2786560	He will yeah, what's his what's his quote?
2787520	2791440	Expect me to lie as an intelligence officer. You should expect me to lie to you. I think you said that
2792480	2798560	Have you investigated cold fusion aka low energy nuclear reaction scalar physics? No, I have not I'm currently
2799200	2803680	Right now behind the scenes. I'm trying to uh educate myself a little more on the physics
2803680	2807360	I know that sounds funny coming from an engineer that I don't really understand the physics
2807600	2814160	But I really haven't spent much time uh researching physics of of of this stuff and I'd really like to so I'm trying to educate myself
2814160	2819440	Before I speak too much on a topic. I'm not too educated about no one is above the law. I agree
2820400	2822400	sk was the di
2822720	2825040	DIA during ossa an atyp. Yes, he was
2826080	2830080	What's the best way to support my work right now? Just watch the video share it with your friends
2830080	2832400	Please if you learn something talk to people about it
2832880	2834880	uh people should be
2835280	2840240	Uh discussing this subject because it's so interesting and uh, I hope that over time
2840800	2842800	There's just not as much
2843440	2847920	We we can we can do our part right now to decrease the stigma around this topic. We really can
2849120	2854160	I've seen clips like the three frames that was and I've only seen some stuff scrolling through twitter
2854240	2858800	And and that was uh, that was really interesting. I don't know. I haven't dug into that very much
2860400	2862400	These seven years have started up
2863040	2868320	Any time these last seven years more. Yes more. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. There's kind of been uh
2868960	2870960	This is a period of time where there has been
2871200	2872560	almost uh
2872560	2874800	Irreversible movement in the realm of uap
2877280	2882560	That is the uh, so infiltration by hybrids that is the original work of david
2883040	2885040	Ike right who talks about
2885200	2890880	I think it was him who who originally thought of uh, reptilians and so forth. I I've never
2891600	2893600	Really kind of dug into that topic
2894400	2898160	Uh, what is my favorite ufo k slash whistleblower?
2898640	2900640	whistleblower
2901760	2903760	Um ufo case
2907440	2916240	That's a good question. Uh, uh, let's think my favorite case. Of course, this would be a crash retrieval. Uh, I just think
2916960	2918960	Hmm
2918960	2923040	I'm not going to do a cop out by saying roswell because that's everybody's favorite taste
2924400	2926400	Hmm
2926720	2928160	I
2928160	2929760	really like
2929760	2933920	Just researching and reading about the 1974 cayome mexico case
2934720	2940080	I really like shag harbor. I really really like kexburg. Um
2943200	2945200	Right now let's
2945840	2948640	Favorite case right now at this moment. Let's say kexburg
2949360	2950960	whistleblower
2950960	2956320	Of course, I think in everybody's heart. I've talked about this before I try not to talk about them too much because I'm sort of
2956320	2959840	Blinded by bias because I want to believe him everybody's favorites bob lasar
2960640	2964240	But again, I I don't cover him or ever reference him in terms of like, okay
2964240	2970240	Like this case might be valid because remember bob lasar said this but because I want to believe him so badly growing up
2971520	2976240	What bob said just captured my mind so much but favorite whistleblower
2977600	2979120	of course
2979120	2981120	Probably one that I've covered
2981280	2986800	Who there was some a little bit of controversy around that's not technically a whistleblower that did not want
2987360	2990720	That said that his story was not true from where I found it
2992080	2992960	A little bit
2992960	2998000	I find daniel solter is a documentary called the UFO the greatest story ever denied and it's only short segments
2998000	3001680	I emailed let me check it if you email it to me and I missed it. I'm sorry about that
3001760	3004240	I'm pretty behind on email. So I will get to that
3005200	3008640	Much love from norway keep up the good work. Hey, thanks, man. I was just in norway last september
3008640	3011040	I went to jevick and oslo. I love norway
3012240	3015280	mj-12 is interesting ryanwood has yes, yes, right?
3015280	3020480	This is why ryanwood is the person i'm going to meet with on this because ryanwood is the best person
3020480	3022480	I know about mj-12
3022720	3027760	In my recent video when I talked about the non terrestrial science and technology the committee on that I
3028480	3030480	immediately reached out to ryanwood
3030960	3035680	And i'm going to be discussing with that with him more when I get back from japan i'm going to be meeting with him
3035680	3037680	So i'm really looking forward to that
3038640	3043360	What are the thoughts that we talked about this a little bit before and make sure you 70 I think I'll probably stay clear of that
3043920	3048960	For now just because of the the drama and stuff around that one thing I hope I hope you guys know for me
3048960	3051360	It's I really don't want to get interested in like
3052640	3054880	Like social media drama. I don't like that
3056240	3060320	There's no grounded. There's thousands of ny hi stories around the world if just one is true. Yes, there are
3061120	3063120	thousands um
3063280	3065680	Back a while ago some guys at jujitsu brought up that heat map
3066240	3071360	Of ufo sightings and pointed to the fact that the us was the most populated region even though it was a us study that
3071600	3073200	generated this heat map of
3073200	3079760	The coagulated ufo sightings and so forth and all you have to do is look at the hundreds of if not thousands of stories from
3079920	3084080	All around the world. There are so many rich stories. I'm hoping when i'm in japan
3084640	3087600	I can talk to some kind of local people of I can't speak japanese
3087600	3091040	But if some people speak good english ask them about local ufo stories
3093440	3097120	Pentagon still hasn't really passed an audit by the previous gao standards. I researched that a while back
3098160	3100160	Anything else?
3101040	3104080	Yeah, this is a great a great point
3104080	3108800	I'd probably recommend to anybody just some take some breaks have some hobbies outside of uap
3110160	3113040	Watch some good movies watch some science fiction watch some interstellar
3113600	3115200	Watch the expanse
3115200	3118880	Just be able to chill out for a little bit. I know that's important for me at least
3119840	3126960	What would some people are talking about saps disclosing we have people all throughout space literally a breakaway society?
3127280	3129280	Yeah, that's a that's a really interesting
3130320	3136320	Concept the the idea of the the kind of breakaway society as people reference to the reverse engineering programs
3137360	3139360	That's a lot too
3139840	3141200	Lot to explore sorry
3141200	3144240	I got caught up with this profile picture not the name my family
3144720	3149920	Does support me my mom's the best she always watches my videos and wants to talk about the cases so she's great
3152320	3154480	Come up to kexburg, you know what?
3155520	3160480	I actually would like to when I cover kexburg. That's actually a good idea. I would like to try and get boots on the ground
3160960	3167040	Uh, that actually I'd like to do that more. That'd be uh, great. I'd like to do that a lot. Zach. What's up, brother?
3167840	3172080	Any videos you think could be legit ufo's england from 98? I'm trying to think about that
3172240	3174800	So I use this a lot in my b-roll footage
3175440	3178400	One of my favorite sightings there's two sighting here
3178880	3181360	It's not the green triangle from tom DeLonge
3181840	3187040	But it's that individual's triangle sighting of the three-pointed triangle with the the red circle in the middle
3187440	3191680	That takes off at very fast speeds. I haven't done a full analysis on that but I
3192720	3199360	Really really really love that footage. I'm still I'm still kind of uh back and forth on both fly by and
3199680	3205680	The metapod I think the metapod might have a little more credence, but those still I'm still kind of trying to uh
3206560	3208560	Trying to think through a little bit. All right
3210720	3214960	Salvador paiz looks familiar and I may have worked with him in the power and propulsion division at navair packs river
3215040	3216320	Holy cow
3216320	3222160	If you were working at packs river in the propulsion and power division you very well may have that is really interesting
3222720	3226880	Uh, if you remember anything about him, let's talk. I'd love to hear about uh paiz
3227840	3230400	Let's all head out to skinwalker ranch and eat a bunch of mushrooms
3231280	3234880	That all sounds fun and dandy until the filming crew kicks us off the land
3236160	3239840	Ryan thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. We will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure
3240400	3246080	Caught a yes. I hope so that that is going to be one of my uh greatest missions to try and do
3246880	3251200	Are there any associations between weather and UFO sightings? I actually I actually if I'll be honest
3251200	3258320	I have no idea. I really don't um, that's a that's a good question to ask if there's any variable weather padding patterns and mass sightings and so forth
3258320	3260320	I I do not know
3261200	3265200	Uh, what are your thoughts on the coast to coast am interview with victor alleged?
3265920	3271200	as foreworker who smuggled footage out of the alien interview tape, uh, I know that there's a lot of
3271760	3274640	Discussion around that. I think it's that's uh, john stewart
3275840	3279120	That's uh, john's the case. John stewart is working on is it not um
3279360	3281360	I
3282400	3286000	There was a weird connection between that and calahari I read today
3287200	3290640	In terms of in like file notes for referencing calahari
3291680	3296400	I am not quite sure. I haven't spent too much time. I know there's a lot of controversy around the video
3296800	3301360	But somebody recently was like doing an analysis where they inverted colors to track like pupil
3302160	3307440	Tracking on the supposed bean. It's it is that is uh, that's really interesting
3307760	3311120	So I would I will do a little bit more studying and kind of get back
3311920	3317040	Crade thank you. Thank you, man. I appreciate that and I'm sorry my answer to your question about
3317920	3321680	Why I do not think that good guys first bad guys is misinformation
3322080	3325600	I'm actually gonna I'll do a community post about that in the future because that's such a good question
3326400	3334320	Golden is dolin is the gold standard. I completely agree. Uh, dolin and colt heart and lenard lenard string field are my inspirations
3334320	3340560	Especially lenard string field that man's a legend. If you haven't read crash retrieval, uh one through seven
3340640	3344480	I highly recommend it. Leonard string field is an amazing individual
3346000	3349920	Why do you think he hasn't spoken recently? I do think what grush is doing is work behind the scenes
3349920	3355440	I'm not sure how much he can contribute to to a public discourse right now unless there's more senate hearings
3356080	3358480	I'm not sure what else he can say publicly
3359200	3363120	Uh to pass dopser that hasn't already been said, but of course. I don't know grush
3363920	3368480	Uh, but I would like to know what do you mean pitchfork? Everything you said is a lie
3369040	3371040	john s
3371120	3376080	My man, thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. I agree with starfield. Yeah, I played a little bit of it and it kind of
3376560	3381280	Stunk 2017 prey. No, I really want to play that. Uh, if any of you guys here play games
3381680	3386640	Let me hear what you play. I love I love me some games. Um, so I would like to play
3387360	3388640	Starfield
3388640	3390640	I'm sorry. Sorry. I mean prey
3390800	3392240	I heard recently
3392240	3396320	Pine gap is a pretty decent location if you go to greer's dpi archive
3396800	3400080	And search and look at pine pine gap documents
3400560	3404320	I think he has two witnesses talk about pine gap and a facility there
3404800	3408720	I've also heard from some other individuals that pine gap might be the location there
3408720	3411360	There was some interesting stuff around a korea location
3411760	3416080	But I also talked to a guy who was pretty familiar with kind of fai and fight transponders and stuff
3416080	3418080	And he kind of talked about the purpose of that facility and
3419120	3422480	He said that uh, that korea location may not exactly be it
3424880	3429600	Looking cut. I appreciate that man. It's just the lighting. I'm a bit of a I'm a bit of a jelly roll right now
3429600	3431600	I do that so I can smash people in jujitsu
3432560	3436240	Path of exile a couple of my buddies play that they say it's great. I might have to
3437280	3440480	Speaking on behalf. Thank you for watching. I really appreciate that guys
3441360	3444000	This is all governments do is lie and then shame me for questioning them
3445360	3451600	You go. Yeah, I mean, uh, in many respects governments don't really have the the public's best interest in mind
3452720	3454880	I'm still waiting on some quality alien video
3455760	3460480	They are here looks cool to have atmosphere, but it'd be awesome to see something ground based on the current knowledge and culture
3461040	3463600	Yeah, I'd love I'd also love, um
3464560	3466560	if we could ever get access to the, um
3467600	3470720	satellite images that both grush and melin have discussed
3471760	3473760	Uh high quality satellite images showing uap
3475440	3478400	You're great to be an interview with a grush and alizano. That would be
3479040	3483600	Absolutely, that'd be a classic that'd be an absolute classic. I'd love to see alizano talk more
3484160	3488640	Huge fan of his interviews with kerch. I'm mongolo on the theory of everything. Those are absolutely fantastic
3488640	3494640	If you haven't watched those I highly recommended and if you haven't watched, uh, David grush's jre appearance
3494640	3497280	I highly recommend that too. I watched it, uh
3499040	3501040	Thursday for like the fifth time
3501520	3504800	I actually have some problems with joe on that interview if i'm being honest
3505200	3509760	Joe really kind of worships the ground guys like bob lasar and travis walton walk on right
3510160	3512240	He always talks about bob lasar and his credentials
3512640	3518400	But he kind of was acting a little bit negative towards grush, which was really interesting to me. Um
3519600	3520640	You know
3520640	3523360	I I just I didn't really like how joe handled that interview
3524240	3526240	I just might brother. Thank you
3526960	3528960	Toby I appreciate that. Um
3529760	3531760	I would like to
3532320	3534720	Uh, I would like to try and stream like once a week
3535680	3540240	That would actually be really fun. I'd like to do that. Are there links between her era and r.a. No, there are not
3542000	3545440	If you talk about danger like the u.s. Military is I mean the
3546560	3548560	I hope not man. I'm not
3550080	3553600	Like the u.s. Military. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a point
3554560	3561040	U.p. Show up in ir. That's why regular cameras don't capture them. Yeah, I've heard this too. I I can't remember. What's that gentleman who?
3561760	3563760	showed up at the um
3564880	3567760	He showed up at the sci conference
3568400	3571840	I can't remember but he's starting like a startup to track uap with various systems
3571840	3575360	I I can't remember this young man's name, but he's seen his work seems really
3576240	3581760	Promising toby. I talked about that a little bit earlier. I talked about uh the interesting aspects about
3582640	3590080	The the insider and that this case is difficult or I don't won't talk about it too publicly too much anymore just because I like
3590880	3595280	It's difficult to talk about this case without referencing kind of like the the evidence and so forth
3595280	3597280	Joey has talked about about this insider and so forth
3597280	3604400	But as I mentioned earlier, I was able to also kind of analyze this insider or find out about this individual in a roundabout way
3606320	3610720	I've seen two ufo one in texas one in houston. Tell me about him and I'd love to hear with it
3612640	3619120	I agree with watching much footage, but user five posted and read it in youtube some extremely compelling videos using the thermal camera
3619280	3623520	I'll check that out. I I would I of course love watching footage. I just don't um
3624320	3626320	I don't I just don't uh like
3627040	3632000	Focus too much on it, but yeah, I'll absolutely watch hackology. I'm an active mod of many subs due to my interest
3632000	3634000	I would love to send you my sightings. Yes, please
3634400	3635440	um
3635440	3639040	uap girl about gmail.com. I'll be spending a lot of time kind of looking at
3639760	3642160	Uh, kind of catching up with emails on my flight to japan
3642720	3644160	Are there con?
3644160	3650560	Are the contracts classified from government sites? I do not know the government sites would probably won't hear about the contracts
3651520	3657680	Jimmy, thank you very much. I really appreciate that and that's a really cool sushi shu. I um, thank you so much really
3659920	3662880	They're here and they take whatever animal person that they
3663600	3665600	have invaded long ago, so
3666240	3672160	I think it was colm kelleher that stated I'd like to know what you think about this. I think it was colm kelleher that touched on the
3673280	3676960	cattle mutilation and said that he his personal hypothesis was that
3677600	3680000	There was some sort of agency detecting detecting like
3680640	3685120	preons and local prions preons. I don't know. Okay. I'm sorry. I can speak in local cow population
3685120	3686480	What do you think about that?
3686480	3693600	You've seen the ner off website. Yes, I don't maybe not the a new version. I don't know. I could have checked that out, man
3694480	3696480	um
3696880	3698880	There's a government site of all
3699280	3703920	If there is a government site, I actually haven't found it. I usually find contracts on private company
3704560	3707520	Their various investor websites, so if there is I actually need to find that
3708240	3712640	We I ever make a video on the disclosure act 2.0. I probably will not and here's why
3713840	3720560	Actually, I haven't covered the original disclosure act. There's only minor differences in the disclosure act 2.0 the same
3721520	3723520	numerous references to
3723680	3730880	non-human intelligence legacy programs crash materials the 1954 atomic energy agreement classifying uap material as clans
3731600	3733600	Trans classified for a nuclear material
3733840	3739120	And that is how much of this has not been disclosed because anything that's new nuclear secrets doesn't really need to be disclosed
3739120	3742720	So maybe I will just because I haven't even talked about the first act in general
3743520	3747440	And at the point where see their breakaway civilization that are group keeping the locked away for good reason
3747920	3749200	um
3749200	3750800	yeah
3750800	3752800	I understand the um
3753360	3756160	I don't I struggle with the good reason. I think back to the
3756800	3759120	original news nation interview with ross colthardt
3759760	3766160	And grush said one of the reasons for this being kept secret was feudalistic dominance. Uh, I can't think of a good reason behind that
3767600	3769600	What are your thoughts on ai?
3770320	3775920	Being a part of the phenomenon. Um, I'm thinking back to section five behavioral analysis from the flyby footage from that
3776480	3777680	a
3777680	3780560	leak that occurred on I think it was 4chan that I
3781200	3789360	Still don't have really a place for um that talked about basically some craft being sort of an advanced model of of uh ai
3789920	3791920	I don't know. Um
3792080	3795680	Grush had some interesting things to talk about ai on jre too
3796800	3804240	and and especially his worries of of using ai offensively in in uh adversarial systems basically dropping the ai
3804640	3808160	expecting it to perform but then kind of not really having uh,
3808640	3811120	Not really having hackology. I just got your email. Thank you
3811120	3814880	But not really having a way to kind of control the ai. So ai is rather frightening
3815520	3820080	Uh, how it relates to the phenomenon. I'm not quite sure but I uh, I don't know
3822000	3826800	Have it dig into silicon-based life like is suggested. Yes, there is a great youtube
3827040	3830480	I watched a really good youtube documentary on silicon-based life
3831040	3836480	And there is a really good like a graphics-esque, uh youtube channel. I I can't remember
3837680	3844080	Heck, what is the name? I'll find it. No, I'll plug it. But yes, I have silicon-based life is extremely interesting
3845360	3846800	Um
3846800	3849120	So what are your thoughts on the lani's amora case?
3850400	3853680	Yes, I would love to cover more of the classic cases. Uh, currently
3854080	3860080	I'm looking at interesting parallels between the lani's amora case craft and the calahari desert south africa in 1989
3860080	3862080	alleged crash retrieval
3862160	3864160	if you look through some of the uh,
3864160	3870480	Military documents alleged military documents that were recreated discussing the 1989 craft the crash had similar
3871040	3873040	Symbology from the lani's amora case
3873040	3878400	So I do want to cover that because now I'm I'm really interested in kind of that symbology and so forth and trying to understand that
3880240	3882240	Abductions, what do I think about uh,
3882320	3886480	Stephen Greer to evil humans being michael akino the leader of this set temple
3887440	3890000	Greer is a bit of an enigma to me if I'm being honest
3890400	3895120	I'm not quite sure about so many of his motives and it's weird because so much of his research is brilliant
3895920	3898160	And then so much of what greer has done post
3899440	3903600	You know a certain date wherever we can find he started to do some some interesting stuff
3904880	3910240	Abduction cases are really interesting. I kind of mentioned earlier one of my first ever cases. I read about was betty and barney hill
3910880	3911760	um
3911760	3915040	So and of course, I know travis walton many of the famous cases
3915760	3919280	They're really interesting. I don't know what to make of them to be honest. Um
3921200	3924880	I what interests me is the intent behind
3925360	3930960	abduction, so I would want to uh, I would really kind of want to backtrack and
3931360	3935760	Try to find context around the abduction and try to determine motives as to why this happens
3935840	3939040	But abductions are really interesting and they're extremely frightening
3939520	3944320	To think of if you guys have seen fire in the sky, I know it's a dramatization about travis walton's case
3944880	3951520	The scene where travis walton is uh, basically experimented on fire in the sky came out in 93 is terrifying
3952720	3957520	I believe bob, let me know what you guys think about, uh, lasar, of course lasar is such an interesting case
3957680	3959680	Hopefully we can get to the bottom of his case
3960080	3965920	Again, like what I said is he's tough for me to talk about because I am just so biased in towards bob
3966000	3970880	I want to believe him so bad. So it's hard for me to take an objective lens because you know
3970960	3975840	I'll see problems with bob sesame. I'll say yeah, well, maybe this because I I want to believe him so darn bad
3976400	3982400	Toby, thank you very much. Uh, I I'm trying to get through everything. I'm sorry if I'm slow guys. I know I can ramble
3983200	3988000	Do you think consciousness is tied to the you I've heard that maybe these vehicles could be controlled with consciousness
3988080	3990160	And so can you elaborate on how you view consciousness?
3990880	3995440	A while ago if you asked me I probably would have said no, but over time more and more cases I follow
3995440	3998720	There's more and more kind of link between human cognition human consciousness and
3999360	4002880	UAP some of the claims that vehicles can be controlled with consciousness
4002960	4008160	Of course, you have Michael talking about p Michael Herrera talking about p3's but also backtracking a little bit
4008160	4013200	You have uh, ross colt heart talking about kind of consciousness interface with controlling craft
4013280	4016160	You also have the infographics whistleblower fees to be real
4016640	4022560	That retrieval teams need to have basically grounding mechanisms. So their brain isn't distorted by the phenomenon
4022880	4025680	You have Gary Nolan. You have Jacques Valet. You have
4026640	4031040	Lou Elizondo who's discussed this and you have many more who have talked about issues with cognition and
4031840	4035040	various problems that occur with the human mind encountering UAP
4035840	4037200	um
4037200	4043040	So at this point, I do think there is a link between consciousness and cognition and UAP what it is
4043120	4047920	I don't know. I really don't know and I'd love to find out because remember i'm coming from a realm
4048240	4054960	A science realm where you think of of synapses and stuff in in the driving cause between the human brain
4055040	4059440	But more and more I studied this phenomenon the more and more there's a strange link between these
4060560	4064960	Hey, griff, when's the next iceberg episode? Would you guys like another iceberg episode? I don't want to like
4066000	4069520	The thing is I don't want anybody to be disappointed when I put out a release
4069840	4070160	um
4070160	4074560	I would love to make more iceberg because it's kind of fun to put a little bit more human a little bit more
4074560	4076960	Or a humor a little bit more of a personal spin on stuff
4077200	4081200	But if you guys don't like the icebergs, I won't do it. But if you guys want to see some icebergs, I'll do it
4081280	4082720	I also
4082720	4087200	Maybe I'll wait till 10k. I'm going to do the taxonomy from carl nels deleted slide
4087920	4090800	Just talking about every single possible origin of nhi
4091600	4093120	so
4093120	4100240	Uh apek arts parts and analysis and their thruster experiments. I have not ch, but that sounds really good. I'm gonna write that down
4101040	4103040	Thank you guys if whenever people
4103920	4108320	Put stuff out like this for me to look at I really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart
4109440	4110720	Uh
4110720	4114160	If you had to estimate the amount of people who have been part of a crash retrieval reverse engineering team
4114160	4115760	What do you think the number is?
4115760	4118800	This is total guess, but I'd say relatively
4119600	4121040	small like
4121040	4123040	In history maybe below 500
4124000	4132400	In my guess you ate your crash retrieval teams the personnel on them are probably highly highly highly specialized
4133760	4135760	and if you look at
4137360	4142640	Remember recently I mentioned that uh christopher sharp article about the oga and jsoc
4143520	4148480	Joint special forces operations command if some of these crash retrieval operators are jsoc
4148560	4151680	They are highly trained and those don't come a dime a dozen
4152880	4155600	Ecology mj-12 fifth annual review uh written
4156560	4159200	I need to look at the if was that written by ryanwood
4160080	4162080	I gotta look at that
4162720	4167040	Rattle rattle. Thank you so much. We need to support you. Thank you. I appreciate that very much
4168240	4173760	Um, sorry, let me I'm a young richard dolin. I thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Um
4174720	4180320	I he's a true inspiration hunting victor the documentary tell me i'ma write that down
4180400	4182960	I will download that and watch that on the plane
4182960	4184960	I
4188960	4192240	Play minecraft minecraft is great bro. Everybody loves minecraft
4192960	4198560	Wow, I would love to play wow, although I think I would lose my holy cow. Are we just getting to the the games?
4198800	4201200	I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. Uh
4202080	4206960	I'm sorry. Uh, I'm taking so slow a lot of people have called greer grifter neglecting the important work. Yes
4207040	4209040	I agree. This is why I talk
4209440	4213200	In almost every video about the 2001 disclosure briefing document
4213200	4219920	I think that piece of literature is brilliant and a must read if you haven't I highly highly highly recommend it
4219920	4221920	It's fantastic
4222640	4227760	Have you ever read inside flying objects by michael p masters? No, I haven't but michael p masters is really interesting
4227760	4230800	I'd like to uh, I'd like to get into a bit more of his work
4231600	4233280	You are a beast
4233280	4238320	bjj and i give you those guns. No, I just lift a lot of weight. Thank you
4238880	4241360	What are your thoughts on steven greer? It seems like uh
4242320	4245040	Ever hey, do you want so I've talked about greer a lot
4245680	4251120	Uh, I have mixed feelings on greer because I don't like how he charges thousands of dollars for ce5
4251360	4255040	And I don't like how he self-aggrandizes himself in his witness stories
4255680	4259680	A good example of this is michael herera's case when michael herera discusses
4260640	4262640	That he was held at gunpoint by these men
4263200	4265200	the black operators
4265760	4271920	When he observed the ufo greer likes to take it a step further by saying that he was made to turn around and get on his knees
4272800	4274720	Uh, basically thinking he's gonna get shot in the back of the head
4274720	4278480	So greer likes to kind of control these witnesses a little bit
4278480	4283840	It seems and kind of aggrandize the stories when it makes a little sense to make them seem a little bit more sensational
4284080	4286080	Sensational however at the same time
4286320	4290560	Stephen greer has done exceptional work for ufology exceptional work
4290960	4297680	2001 disclosure briefing document is a fantastic piece. I so recommend reading that the greer witness list
4297760	4304080	I talk about this every time I reference the subject these people need to be separated from greer himself
4304720	4309760	Okay, just because they're contacting greer their case a lot of people say oh like he's in contact with greer
4310000	4314800	We shouldn't look at his case. No these individuals deserve to be analyzed just as much as anybody else
4315600	4322720	Some of the work greer has done is excellent. There's a top line summary in the disclosure briefing document that talks about the program back in 2001
4323440	4328800	I I find it and I'll post it, but it's fantastic. I'll actually do a community post on it. Um
4330720	4335520	What are your thoughts on ai as an aspect we talked about that a little bit have I watched professor simon holland's
4335520	4339520	I've heard of professor simon holland, but not orford ness. I will actually get into that a little more
4340240	4341920	um
4341920	4346160	Once a spook always a spook and I remove that comment with the word line. Yeah, once a spook always a spook
4348000	4353680	Hey, man, really enjoy your detail oriented videos remind me of think anomalous who covers some of these cases when he sometimes includes details
4353760	4357360	Other researchers overlook. Thank you very much. I really appreciate those kind words
4358720	4364160	He's in project gravitar with little zars input coming out this year s4 recreated in vr in crazy detail. Yeah
4364720	4369520	um, I know on the project gravitar website or kind of some of their promotional material
4369520	4375760	They have screenshots from the craft and that's really interesting. Also mac mayve studios has a great video inside
4376560	4380480	Inside area 51 and s4. I've used some b-roll footage for that
4380720	4385360	I'd really like to collaborate with that dude because he makes some awesome stuff. But yeah, check that out. That's great
4385920	4389760	Greetings from chile. What's up, brother? Thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words
4390640	4394880	Trying to give you money. It's okay, man. Well, thank you for having me on patreon. But I
4395600	4400400	Thank you so much day after raswell is core. So yeah, I'm sorry. I was looking at that. I think the raswell incident
4400400	4402400	That's bill more come to think of it
4403200	4405760	Game recommendations. You can never go wrong with doom 2016
4406480	4410560	Doom plus doom eternal. Yeah, the doom games are fantastic to zealot. I hope you're still here
4410720	4414080	God of war ragnarok is fantastic as well. I can't wait for that new doom game
4414880	4418720	Games games. I'm trying to think is no games have really caught my attention too much lately
4419520	4424080	I'm gonna replay ghosts of sushi ma if you haven't played that that's an excellent game. I can't wait
4425040	4428960	UAP humanoid encounters coming out of peru. No, but I know that ross coldheart just did a video on that
4428960	4433120	Those are pretty interesting. They talk about beings that like melt people's faces off
4434160	4437920	Of course, I can't discount anything. I just haven't done enough research to have a very informed opinion
4437920	4441920	It's very interesting though. And I'd like to listen to that reality check episode that talks about this
4443280	4449440	Um, what are your thoughts on the nascar mummies? I post this website last time because I talked about it on a recent video
4449920	4452160	You should check out the 3d scans of all the mummies
4452160	4455520	You can kind of go through the the different layering of them. It's super interesting
4456000	4461200	And guys in about 15 minutes. I'll have to hop off. So I'm going to get through everything because I got a pack
4461200	4463200	I haven't I haven't packed um
4463360	4467920	Huckology. Yes, I have and I will post that as well. What do you think about pyramids in Alaska?
4467920	4470400	It's one of the price locations remote view prior to his death
4470960	4473120	uh, the remote viewing is
4473200	4479520	Yeah, Alaska is a very mysterious land. I've heard of a possible reverse engineering locations in Alaska as well
4479920	4481920	I think Alaska is a very mysterious land. I
4483360	4488480	Don't know. I don't know maybe remnants of an ancient civilization in Alaska. I don't know
4489520	4494080	I do not know but that's a good question fat rodents. Thank you so much watching this with buddies
4494080	4499520	We'll tell your slimes as the kids say I say hi getting money. Thanks. Hopefully. Thank you very much. I appreciate that
4500000	4501440	Got a jet
4501440	4503920	Well, you probably signed off but have a great night, bro
4505600	4508080	I'm sure that you've seen yes, I have seen the beaver utah footage
4508320	4512000	It's pretty interesting, but I haven't given it a full analysis like I I don't want to just say like
4512160	4519280	I think this or this without uh, really thoroughly looking at something. Um, but you know, I will take a take a harder look
4520480	4526400	Listen, you know, actually that would be kind of fun if any of you guys want to kind of get together and play some games together
4526480	4530720	I'd love to do that. Colm said there seemed like there were two groups. One had the laser tech trying to go through
4531440	4534480	Uh, imitate mutilations. I had not heard that. Thank you for clearing that up
4534720	4541280	I've got to look into that as well. Say get employee. What is your day job? I am an engineer. I do mostly qa
4542080	4544480	Engineering these days and it's very boring
4546160	4550640	If you see any clear ufo company, yes, uh, jennanette is fantastic
4550720	4556160	Someone sent me one of his videos, uh, recently and they're really great. I would highly recommend
4557600	4560800	But have you blocked s but he's on mj 12. It's really good
4561600	4563600	No, I have not
4563920	4565920	No, I will read that. Thank you
4566880	4571840	Finally caught alive is the ufo news dying out. No, I do not the mall incident. No, I do not think so
4571840	4576160	I think with the 2024 I think after congress recesses in august as this issue is voted on
4576560	4579680	We'll see a lot more interesting things and I think with lulis ando's book coming out
4580240	4582080	We'll see a lot of interesting things
4582080	4587680	Ethan Simmons. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Enjoy japan. I'll see what other data. Thank you very much
4587760	4591840	I will use this money to feed myself some delicious sushi. Thank you so much
4592800	4597600	Uh, let me I'm trying to go fast guys. I'm sorry. I'm so slow. No sweat
4598720	4601280	Why would these uap let themselves be seen?
4601600	4606480	I don't know attributing motives to the phenomenon if you've read jock valet's book dimensions and passport to magnolia
4607040	4609040	it seems like sometimes the uh
4609680	4615040	It seems like sometimes the uap either want themselves to be seen once it disguised themselves as other things or so forth
4615360	4620560	Attributing motives and understanding. I really don't have any idea. I really don't I'd like to understand more
4621520	4627120	What about the young guy's tracking, uh, ronnie vernet? No, he was just with reality check yet
4628160	4631120	No, the the young man. I who is tracking you a photo or
4632160	4636080	Uap with his equipment. That's not him. I just can't remember what his name is
4638000	4642720	Uh, you on reddit should have posted a live chat. That's all right, man. AJ green. That's the famous
4643360	4646800	Excellent bangles player. Good name. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yes
4647360	4653840	I will be covering the maje brazil crash and I will hopefully be able to be using mac maves studios footage on that
4654400	4656400	absolutely
4656400	4657440	uh
4657440	4659440	No, I cannot
4660480	4665840	The um first australian's triangle shaped constellation a group of triangle shaped. Okay
4666560	4671600	Basically, so three stars in the triangle formation. Did they move at all in the formation or did it stay pretty uniform?
4672560	4674240	um
4674240	4676240	One sec. Sorry guys. I'm getting a call
4677520	4679520	I
4679920	4681920	Sorry guys
4682320	4684960	My bad. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to skip over that
4686160	4691120	UAP being controlled mostly by a mic's perfect sense also the craft piloted by actual biologic nhi
4691120	4694880	It was heavily declines the 60 70s and 80s nowadays nowadays mostly ai
4694960	4698480	So yeah, that that kind of boils down to like the von neumann self replicating probe, right?
4698480	4703440	I talked about that in the infographic show. That's a pretty interesting uh idea john michael godier
4703520	4707440	Who's a great he has a great youtube channel who talks a lot about kind of
4708000	4708560	uh
4708560	4714480	Fermi paradox extraterrestrial intelligence and so forth talks often about how von neumann probe is a very applicable solution to
4715120	4721440	uh spreading the civilization basically and into its own galaxy without violating faster than light travel
4722240	4724240	and so forth so the the some
4724240	4728480	Many uap being controlled by ai does make sense if we think to that infographics video
4728480	4734000	I think it's just like the basically the uh saucers and possibly triangles that are piloted such things as bells
4734480	4737120	Spheres and so forth are are mostly drones
4739520	4741840	Capital s pattern. Oh that is interesting
4742080	4745040	It is always it is extremely interesting when you see something
4745760	4751760	In the sky that is exhibiting flight patterns that you when you start to notice one of the five or six observables of uap
4751760	4753760	And assigning this super interesting
4754640	4760080	One of the best since it made up the story to get out of it. I've heard that too and if that's the case those men are some of the
4761200	4765280	smartest people alive to make up a uap abduction story to get out of a contract
4767200	4771600	I believe bob and there's a lot of things that were corroborated, but only is the education thing
4771600	4773760	Yeah, I think the education thing is a little too uh
4774880	4778960	Played out a little people focus on that too much. Of course, it's a valuable thing to use
4779600	4783280	To kind of talk against bob, but people bring that up too much. I believe
4784720	4786160	Uh
4786160	4790240	You have one of those signed too. Yeah, that's what you can't see here is the the reactor
4790960	4795280	Uh, and how the the sports model works too. This is just an excellent piece
4796240	4798240	psionics. Yes
4799200	4805600	Lazar is definitely a friday can email you all the proof study tis and type please please uap gur about uh gmail.com if you're still here, man
4805600	4808080	I I would like to to read that a lot
4808960	4810960	They can mess with our brains experiences
4811920	4813920	Correct stan freeman didn't like lasar. Yes
4814480	4819760	Yes, or stan freeman did talk against lasar quite a bit. I'm getting to the iceberg stuff
4820720	4826880	Okay, a lot of people are interested in the the iceberg. So yeah, I will um, I will get to that a little bit
4827680	4831040	So, okay. Yeah, tommy. We talked a little bit about the face peelers
4831760	4833200	uh
4833200	4838160	So if you're interested in jsoc look into the the squadron the 24th st. Yeah
4839120	4845760	Yes, there was somebody on reddit recently like a supposed whistleblower case somebody in the 24th sts who talked about his captain
4846240	4848480	Who was pulled away for very specific duties?
4848480	4854240	Occasionally and one time he talked about seeing some sort of craft that he said wasn't ours and was very shook from it
4854480	4858400	That's a really interesting story. I believe I have that downloaded if anybody wants me to share it with them
4859120	4863920	Cracker jack, thank you very much friends have different monies. Thank you very much
4864000	4866960	I really appreciate your support on the bottom of my heart
4867760	4871360	How many things see uh, see fives or a thing? It's just
4872080	4878720	I don't know. I need mods. I I'd like mods, especially as kind of the channel grows for this stuff
4879440	4880400	but
4880400	4882400	you know, the thing is like
4883040	4886240	Everybody who types here is either wanting to talk to each other or talk to me
4886640	4893040	And I feel like I'm doing people a disservice if I'm just having somebody else filter out what they're saying like if you're typing out a
4893040	4895200	Message specifically to say something to me
4896160	4903840	You know, you are supporting this channel and I owe it to you to look at what you are saying and respond and think about it
4903920	4904960	so
4904960	4906000	mods
4906000	4908320	Mods be damned for the time moment. Um
4909680	4912240	I think that was our brain wash similar to benowitz. That's interesting
4912960	4917440	Uh, see over yeah, I I'd like to the gentleman who said he would talk to um
4918000	4922400	Or send me that information about lasar. I'd like to look at that as well. Greer is clearly a narcissist
4922560	4929040	I thought you said gerb for a second man. I was like, what the heck? But yes, I agree gerb rules you roll telekinesis beats
4930080	4935200	You're truly a young dolin. Thank you so much. Greer was an only option for many witnesses. This is an excellent point
4935200	4940640	I'm sorry for getting to this late. Greer is has been for many people the only option
4941600	4946560	Can I link to the greer briefing document? Yes, I can I'll make a community post on it. Okay
4947280	4949280	Posted on reddit. Thank you very
4949760	4956960	Yes, I've thought about this too. Um lasar after the congressional hearings did uh, I told you so but he hasn't testified
4958080	4960080	The heineck ufo report is excellent
4960480	4966480	Uh, the cia ufo paper is also excellent. I have not heard or I've not read ufo's generals pilots and government officials
4966480	4971360	I absolutely will I've linked to the ufo report and the cia ufo papers in a couple videos
4971360	4973920	So if anybody's interesting those I will watch it
4974880	4980720	The uh, okay hunting victor not out yet. Okay, but I will watch it when it comes out. I didn't know uh,
4981280	4984480	Or jog flay. Yeah, I has also mentioned that bob that he had to whoa
4985280	4990320	Green okay. Yeah, I need to study up a little bit on on that more because that's a pretty interesting theory
4991040	4992800	NASCAR mummies
4992800	4994480	He says slimes
4994480	4999520	Yeah, dude. I I'm still I still try to try to uh, not act not act too old
5000000	5003600	Do you have any really good uap videos? We might have seen I talked about this before but one of the videos
5003600	5006720	I think like lives in my head rent free is the video of the black triangle
5006800	5008800	I include a minute much of my b-roll footage
5009200	5011040	Check it out in my locky martin video
5011040	5016480	It's a footage from a handheld camera of a man taking a video of a black triangle in his backyard that exhibits four lights
5016800	5019120	One light at each vertices of the triangle and one
5019520	5022880	Uh, uh red light middle it takes off at a high speed at the end of the video
5022880	5027680	I don't know if that video is real or not. I'm not advocating for its credibility, but it's really interesting
5028240	5030240	What's up with the phoenix lights?
5030640	5032640	fantastic case uh the
5032960	5038160	Conventional explanation is the a10 warthog flares, right? But then uh pipe or
5039040	5039760	What's the dude?
5039760	5041760	What's the governor's name who came out and said he
5042320	5047120	Was disappointed and how he reacted and coming on stage with an alien suit talking about the phoenix lights
5047200	5051680	The phoenix lights is one of the most interesting cases we have in the public domain in my opinion
5052400	5057840	What do you think about the four-chan whistleblowing that claims about ufo's? Yeah, so he talks about ufo's being made like a
5058720	5059920	or
5059920	5061920	respect per purpose that
5062400	5065200	Four-chan whistleblower is insanely interesting and I will
5065760	5068400	Still cover that full thing at some point because
5069120	5072080	I love that that story. It's just really interesting
5072720	5078720	Mods are not a good policy. Oh, oh, thank you. Tommy. I appreciate that brother mods are not a good freedom
5079440	5081440	Yeah, that's the thing too like
5082320	5086960	I really don't want some uh random person kind of telling people what they can and can't say
5087760	5088640	uh
5088640	5094480	You know, I don't want that howdy from lumberton texas. What's up, man? Thank you very much for joining in vegetable gremlin
5096880	5099040	It it can feel like that. Yeah, uh
5099760	5103360	UAP feels like it never ending circus. I I empathize with that and I understand
5103360	5106880	That's why I think it's so important to kind of pick and choose what you're studying at once
5106880	5108960	You know, you see with a lot of questions people ask me
5109440	5113360	I'll be pretty outright and say I have no idea what I think on the topic because I haven't studied it
5113600	5117760	In this field spreading yourself too thin is a
5118640	5121200	massive detriment. It's really a massive detriment. So
5121920	5123920	focusing on what you like to specialize in
5124480	5129680	researching that branching out occasionally but really trying to focus in on something you can make really good progress
5130640	5135120	My specialty what I like crash retrievals reverse engineering and speaking to witnesses
5135840	5139600	First-hand witnesses that is what I like. There's so much more in this domain outside of that
5139600	5146400	But I'm spreading myself too thin and probably being a little bit demoralized if I were to do that because I can't focus on as much
5147680	5149440	I have a playlist
5149440	5156000	If you look over it help you navigate the electromagnetic. Yes, please please please please send that to me uapgrub at gmail.com
5156160	5158880	Please I I'd love to review that on my flight
5160560	5162560	It's a great time to be alive might
5163120	5167280	And also it yeah, it is this is what an interesting time to be alive
5168240	5170240	Aquedia. Yeah aquedia Peru
5172560	5180160	Uh, I'm trying to think why can't I remember what case aquedia Peru is I've referenced it before but my mind is given a blank
5181760	5187600	A deep dive in a deep dive on if s4 was real I was went to the black at the idea that the bus would be 30 knots on hook
5188720	5190720	Uh, so one of the best
5191120	5193920	I want to do a deep dive on s4 and I have a fantastic document
5193920	5195440	I want to reference for that
5195440	5202800	It is the project Aquarius document that talks about dan barish and gives a detailed layout of all seven layers of s4
5202880	5204880	And I do want to cover that
5206240	5211120	I've been yes, um tenkai, please I I'd really like to read your research
5211680	5214880	5th simington. Yes, that's the names 4chan story seems to check out
5215360	5221040	Uh, yeah, when he talks about the spheres in that he talks about them being like a hammer design, right? So
5221840	5223040	uh
5223920	5225920	Keep reading it. Okay. I've seen
5226480	5228480	uap
5228560	5232480	I've seen uap once at night three lights flying around rapid speed coming to an instant stop
5233120	5235120	okay
5235840	5237840	That is that is a very interesting case
5237840	5240160	So you saw three lights flying out of rapid speed
5240720	5242480	Coming to an instant stop
5242480	5248160	Changing colors and intensity and jumping like a mild and instant instantly continue done its previous path
5248560	5250560	That is extremely anomalous
5251520	5257840	Uh, oh I'm with the okay Puerto Rico. Yes, that is the case where there's uh, yes. Yes, okay
5257840	5260560	I know what you're talking about. That's the 2000. I think 18 footage
5261200	5265440	Where the uap is shown hovering over the town goes into water splits into two and rises
5266400	5269760	Uh tanner johnson. What's up brother? Yes, we are doing alive
5271280	5273280	How did you become interested in the ufo topic?
5273360	5277440	I think it's just the way my brain works ever since I could read one of my first ever books was on the
5277440	5281920	Betty and Barney hill abduction. I've been fascinated with the story since ever I
5282400	5287040	Since I could read since I knew how to think I have always been obsessed with ufos
5287440	5291920	But until I reached my recent age, I didn't really know how to express that, right?
5292240	5296720	and I finally came to a point in my life where I realized I has something to offer in terms of
5297280	5301360	treating the subject like I would a research paper in engineering having a thesis
5301680	5307360	Having a body of work having a body of references and making that into a video trying to make it entertaining that people could watch
5307840	5314320	Try and limit as much of my personal interest in in each video in each research project as much as possible and just deliver
5315280	5316400	the data
5316400	5323120	The facts the surrounding context on a topic. So this is just such an important topic for me. Do I believe dan barish is legitimate?
5323280	5326080	I don't know because I haven't done the um that dive yet
5326160	5330720	And I do know some interesting people who actually have no opinion on dan barish, which is interesting
5331280	5337360	Of course, he talks about j rod. He talks about uh j rod who uh bill u house talks about being retreated from the
5337440	5340480	Kingman crash the thing is with dan barish. He talks about two j rods
5341040	5343280	He talks about j rod uh ebe
5344560	5349040	5 3 az which is the kingman arizona j rod. No j rod two were recovered there
5349040	5352400	He says one was handed off to los alamos national labs one was given to
5353120	5358560	Uh, what's s4? He talks that that is a p 52, you know p 45
5360160	5362960	p 45 species and there's p 52 a riot species
5363440	5369520	So I need to do a deep dive because he's really interesting. I know the the youtube channel night shift did recently
5369520	5371520	So I'll probably wait a little bit
5371520	5372240	um
5372240	5378880	To let that all that die down and do like a full uh full research project. So you observed, um
5379600	5383680	An instantaneous deceleration and acceleration. That is fascinating
5384800	5390240	jimmy carter's ufo report. Yes jimmy carter is really so, um jimmy carter, of course
5390240	5396400	Was an advocate for uap and danie sheehan has stated he performed uap investigation for jimmy carter because of his interest
5397840	5399680	Can you try and vet?
5399680	5406080	Yes, absolutely. I will do that. Um, I'll do a I will do a full research project on his claims
5406640	5413040	Uh, his the project Aquarius and so forth because that that seems like a really interesting thing to explore op tv
5413520	5416240	Um, thank you very much. I really appreciate that
5417200	5422160	Do you know anyone approaching the uap subject from the instrumentation detection angle
5422480	5429360	There's your channel is launching model rockets into the anomalous phenomenon launching rocket. Yeah, I don't think I don't think that's a good idea
5429440	5434720	Yeah, there's that gentleman who's actually building really interesting detection software. I will find his name and I'll post about him
5434720	5437920	I'm sorry. I can't remember right now, but he is the guy right now
5438640	5440480	um
5440480	5445680	That's a yeah, that's the thing it with many sightings they last so briefly
5446240	5448480	You don't have time to get it on any filming mechanisms
5449520	5455840	Mods for time management. Obviously someone we will see we will see as we as we grow we might have more people chatting
5456800	5460720	The looking glass technology is really interesting. If you guys don't know what that is a danbury's claim
5460800	5465200	But I think level four or five and s4. There is some sort of uh, like time
5466320	5469280	manipulation project called project looking glass at s4
5470720	5475920	I'm always wary of involving ebe's living amongst human. Yes. I I am too. I always just
5476640	5483040	Taking them stepping back. Yes, uh, uh, northrop who kind of talked to I think it was
5484800	5488400	I know the video of him in a garden in which he discusses uap openly
5488960	5494400	And that is a very interesting video and when I eventually one day make a video about northrop grum and I will be referencing that
5496000	5499600	Uh, dude exchanging aliens isn't like human trafficking except with a
5499680	5506320	Yeah, it's yeah, exactly. Yeah, if danbury's is telling the truth, they're just swapping ali or et's like yugioh cards
5507040	5510320	You watching for recent. I have not if there are recent metapod videos. Please
5510960	5516880	Please show me if you guys think I'm just kind of lacking on that stuff. It's not I'm just so focused on a few aspects
5516960	5523840	Crafts retrieval reverse engineering and talking to people golden domes. Yes, I will be talking about this golden domes from danie shihan
5524560	5527760	If you guys don't know danie shihan has claimed that there's golden dome
5528480	5533840	What's known as golden dome and the cias technology used to detect uap even when they're cloaked
5534240	5539520	Thanks for the q&a. Hey, good night, brother. Good night, man. Good night from church. Nice, man. Have a great night
5540240	5546080	Agree on the looking glass comment research. Okay guys. I will uh finish up these comments. Then I got to hit the road
5546400	5548400	That's all right. I got a pack. I agree
5548960	5550880	yeah, so
5550880	5556560	Yeah, and this sort they're with danbury's there's so much to unpack it deserves a a lot of research
5557520	5561760	Yes, golden domes. We will absolutely be talking about that in the future
5562480	5567040	It was like a beacon going off on earth. They split the adamant. Yeah, that's a that's a great thing
5567360	5569360	to talk about right like a
5569360	5574000	Huge influx of uap sightings post the first atomic bomb drop. I am of the mind
5574080	5576960	I do think there's been a presence on this phenomena for quite a long time
5577680	5580160	Uh, how long that is I don't know but I think the
5581840	5585440	If we may have lit up like a beacon with the first atomic bomb dropping
5585440	5588080	I do think there has been a presence on this planet longer
5588560	5590880	Since when do you have an interest in uap's forever?
5590880	5592640	I've talked about this a few times brother
5592640	5598800	But uh, I have had an interest in uap since I could think as a human and it has been one of my biggest passions
5599040	5601040	And it wasn't until recently I learned I could
5602000	5604800	Actually try and do good on this subject
5606320	5612000	Just found your channel via jason juror. Who's jason shardrani if he's showing me out. Thank you, man. I appreciate that
5612320	5616720	Just for the record one sighting in austin ever moved. Okay, gotcha
5618000	5621440	Yes, I will cover the uap da because I never covered the 2023 variation
5622000	5625680	All right, I'll get through these and then I'm stopping with aj greens coming on iceberg
5625680	5630240	Have you ever looked in the contrail picture that when pull the pull? No, I have not but I will check that out brother
5631760	5635840	What if the reason why uap is so secretive is the nh i themselves don't uh you us
5636320	5638320	Disclose about their existence for whatever reason
5638720	5643760	Yeah, I I mean the the fact that the phenomenon itself isn't revealing itself is telling right?
5643840	5646720	Like they ultimately have the power to disclose themselves or not
5647200	5654160	Maybe they don't trust us. Maybe we are like maybe the zoo hypothesis has some truth to it that mainly we are just a piece of study
5655120	5659360	Thank you. Zach. I appreciate that man. I thank you for all of your comments on pretty much every one of my videos
5660000	5665120	She hands incredible. I uh jesse michaels has an interview coming out with she hand. I cannot wait for that
5665520	5670720	Hope you got a window seat. No man. I got the aisle. Um, but I'll probably have to trade for my girlfriend. So she'll have
5671600	5673600	I'll have a middle
5673920	5677520	Check out that. Yes. Well, unfortunately, I'll just be going to uh, tokyo and kyoto
5677520	5679920	I won't be have time to go to Hiroshima or Nagasaki
5680640	5682640	Fat rodents. Thank you
5684000	5688160	Uh, I built a technology that allows me to send chats and live streams from the past
5689280	5691280	They're super
5692000	5694000	Yeah, what?
5694400	5698080	Okay, uh, other two stars never moved up. That is very interesting
5699120	5705600	They don't like you here. Maybe it's just an uh impartialness to humans, right? Maybe it's just not even
5706560	5708800	Maybe we are to them. What answer to us?
5709600	5713120	Alpha zero. Hey, man. Nice to see you live. Thank you very much
5713440	5718080	But please don't fall into the black hole. Yes a lot of charlots and jokers. We talked about this earlier
5718080	5721840	I'll always do what I can to uh, kind of ground myself and
5722320	5724320	Kind of not fall into
5724800	5732480	Unhealthy habits. Where am I going tokyo and kyoto? I am going to I will be training at kotokan in tokyo
5732960	5737840	For a little bit of judo too. You were born in uh, yukisoka. That's awesome, bro
5738080	5742560	I'm so excited to visit your beautiful country. It's been my top destination forever. And with that guys
5742560	5744560	I am going to hit the road. So I'll
5745600	5749280	I just feel so terrible about not providing content. So I might provide like some
5750080	5752560	Community posts a little bit like articles about stuff
5753280	5755920	Because I would still like to talk about a couple things
5757040	5762800	So thank you guys so much and samuel. I see this I should interview jj. Yeah, I'll I'll talk to him
5762880	5767920	Absolutely safe travels. Thank you guys and I will when we get back get right back to the videos
5768240	5772720	And then we will also do maybe a weekly live stream where we discussed the most recent case
5773200	5777360	And kind of chat about things and with that guys, I'll catch everyone later. See you
5779280	5782240	You
