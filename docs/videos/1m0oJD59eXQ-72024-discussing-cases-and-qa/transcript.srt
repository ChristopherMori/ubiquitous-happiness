1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,760
Okay, okay, I don't think I got anybody in here

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Let's

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:51,140
See rewatching. Okay. Can you guys can anybody hear me? I'm trying to set this up. I'm still pretty pretty new to lives

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,500
Just trying to check this out, I think we got three

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Okay, oh, what's up quitter? How you doing, man?

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,680
Okay, what's up guys? I'll wait I'm waiting for some people to join

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,000
But I just kind of wanted to chill with everybody for a little bit

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,240
I know we got some good videos out some interesting cases

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,320
I'm actually leaving tomorrow for a trip overseas. So I just kind of wanted to check in with everybody

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
See what everybody's working on

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,320
Kind of understand what cases you guys are looking at also when I get some more people in here

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,880
I wanted to get some book recommendations from everybody for my trip

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,120
Good a long plane ride to Japan. So thus far. Let me see what I got

15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Alexander I am going to Japan

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,220
So I'm doing a little trip to Tokyo and Kyoto tomorrow and it's really weird being on a live

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,480
Talking to myself. You're not talking to myself, but you know what I mean. So for books

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm rereading Michael Schratz

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Crash retrievals of the third kind if any of you guys have heard of that

20
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,200
It is where Schrat got to go through Leonard Stringfield's personal archives in Cincinnati at Mufon

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,120
And he touched on some cases that Stringfield had in the crash. Oh, what's up, Joey?

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,640
What up, Joey? Joey the trip is tomorrow to Japan

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Okay, I want to I want to

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,160
Want to talk about that in a second off TV. I I also don't like flying. It's not my favorite

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,120
But so tomorrow guys for for some of the the books. I mean the day after Roswell. Is that by Bill Moore, Jason?

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
I think it is

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,280
Because if that's if that is in fact by Bill Moore

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
He also

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,960
You guys know the the Grant Cameron files right Grant Cameron released all of his files recently

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,920
Downloadable. He has a lot of contacts with Bill Moore. They had a email connection. This was back in I think

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,000
1998 and they were discussing the Kalahari Desert crash back in 89 in South Africa near the coast of Botswana and of course

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,680
the primary source for that is a little controversial with a

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Guy who claimed he or to be claimed he was making up his South African Air Force credentials

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,320
But Bill Moore in these texts with Grant Cameron in these emails said he had a secondary source for the Kalahari Desert crash

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,680
So I want to link up with Bill more if I can because he is still living. He's very old

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,080
I think he was born in 42 and find out who that secondary source is because the how Kalahari crash is great

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,840
if you guys have ever seen the

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,200
The video from Mack Maeve and his channel got hacked is taken down. So but that's a great video for when it gets back up

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,160
UFO connections to Iceland such as crash retrievals or such brother. Yes. I was actually looking at this yesterday. There is a case

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,760
From the 50s if you look at magic eyes only I actually lived in Iceland for a little bit

41
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Let me see if I can remember where this was

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Okay, it was in the

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,960
Jukula rivers in August of 1954

44
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:12,640
According to Ryan S. Wood one of the primary sources here is the 468 CIC detachment document titles unidentified flying objects dated October 11th

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,160
1954 so oh, okay. Okay, Philip J. Corso. Yeah, that's the day after Roswell men. Yeah, I see what you're saying that

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Corso is awesome. I I actually haven't sat down and fully read day after Roswell

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,880
Which I've only listened to bits and pieces or just kind of reference the book when I needed to

48
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,480
Are there any reports of UFOs around only nuclear warheads artillery or nuclear facilities in general such as well

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,840
I know that of course we have Malmstrom and this was with B 52 bombers

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,120
But in the 50 Monat AFB that is where I think a disc shape craft changed its

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,080
Its altitude in a very rapid session kind of flew around a descending B 52. That's not the case. I know

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
So well Jimmy shoo, thank you so much for the the $20. I really appreciate that

53
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,360
Recommend clear intent government cover-up of UFO. Okay guys, I'm gonna actually grab a piece of paper so I can write this down and

54
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
What?

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,280
Get that to that in a second. So

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
All right, also

57
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,240
above top secret by Timothy good. That's another good piece. I'm rereading tomorrow and

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Since I will be meeting up with Ryan S. Wood soon. I'm rereading all of the MJ 12 files

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
Maybe can I send the link to the chat and yes, okay? Let me go through these. Sorry man

60
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,680
What is my background and how do I get access the informants that that I give?

61
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,240
So my background is mechanical engineering

62
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,120
Studied in university got my bachelors in mechanical engineering

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,480
Currently work in the field more less so mechanical engineering more so just kind of spreadsheets and so forth

64
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,480
but when I started my my channel everything initially started as kind of to

65
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,800
Talk to friends and family who had an interest in this subject. I was the guy who they had come to to speak to

66
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,720
But everything was so discombobulated even my files were just rancid and all over the place. So I started my channel

67
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,760
Well, how I got access to these informants was I didn't give a darn about

68
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,760
Who I called and who I tried to talk to if you guys remember back to the UFO witnesses and so forth

69
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,320
I would just like these guys like MS and TV

70
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,280
I just would call people and I would just talk to them. So I wouldn't really care what sort of situation it was in

71
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,480
I know that

72
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,380
Now it's not really the smartest idea just a cold call because you never know

73
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,060
Who's on the other side, but that is how just kind of brute force

74
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,740
I I know in this space a lot of people aren't really willing to kind of

75
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,660
Put themself if there is a firing line and a firing line

76
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,660
But that's how you do it man

77
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,580
It's with the the differences with Joey, of course because I made my video on

78
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,020
Marines who got close to you to UFOs with Herrera and Wagan and Joey reached out to me

79
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,140
So that was a difference in the case

80
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,540
No Matthew not high-key smart AF man college was super hard for me

81
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,300
The only classes I did really well in were Diffie Q

82
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:22,100
So it's roll mama. Thank you very much. I appreciate that quite a bit and that's a cute gopher or badger

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,140
Whatever it is so actually what what do you guys think about the MH370 videos?

84
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,420
I've tended to stay away from them for now just because I know there's a lot of drama around them

85
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,300
And especially because the videos kind of circulate mostly on Twitter and most the research is on Twitter

86
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,620
I know that there's a lot of weirdly enough drama in the UAP sphere on on Twitter

87
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,740
So that's not necessarily my go-to where I go to kind of look at cases

88
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,260
I know a lot of the time whenever I hop on Twitter. I see people in in rooms just kind of a

89
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,680
Like drama rooms or something like that. So if you guys want to talk about MH370, I'd love to hear it

90
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Yeah, this is also a good question. I see a lot of people talking like

91
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,120
You know, how does a random youtuber talk to these people and that's a great question. I am a random youtuber

92
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
but I just think the

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
difference is like I I

94
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,780
Just try really hard to speak to people and

95
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,240
You know since starting the channel have been able to make some good connections and you know

96
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
Talk to some interesting people and kind of gain some respects and so forth. So

97
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,320
Like the the start of the channel right now. That's just the beginning. You know, I have my inspirations guys like cold heart

98
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,840
And so forth and you know, I would love to over time talk to higher profile whistleblowers

99
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,960
Talk to higher profile first-hand witnesses

100
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,480
Do more interviews that are more documentary style. I like that versus the traditional

101
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,400
I sit on stream yard. I guess it's on stream yard and we talk for two hours

102
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,680
In my opinion at least from like what I like to watch on youtube

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,080
I'm far more interested if an interview has sort of a narrative or documentary around it

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,920
I know that's the case. I'm going to be doing with ryan s wood. Um

105
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,640
Because I really want to do justice to mj12

106
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
And I'm faced with a couple options right like make a 30 to 50 minute video

107
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,560
Just talking about the documents relaying like each line basically to

108
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,160
actual events that have occurred in history or talk to ryan wood

109
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
Who is kind of as much of an expert as you can possibly get to mj12?

110
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,040
And especially his dad who was a private aerospace contractor who started the majestic documents with mr. Wood and so forth

111
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,920
So I like that a lot. Read the book that tim taylor wrote zack. That's actually a great idea. I'm going to write that down too

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,920
Um, and I've heard that as as well. Uh, sorry, I'm just I'm just writing this down from zack real fast

113
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I

114
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,320
Okay, that's a that's this is a great question. So the essence of mj12 is

115
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Back in the 80s. I can't remember if it was 82 87 or

116
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,720
What exactly it was but there was a role of documents mailed to some, uh,

117
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
ufologists such as

118
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
such as stan freedman and these are

119
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,840
The mj12 documents the mj12 purports an organization within the usg established under truman handed to

120
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Eisenhower that basically was formed a little bit before

121
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,080
Ross well because there are references to the interplanetary phenomenon unit, which is actually really interesting

122
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
there's actually two references there's a

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,160
A case protocol for the ipu in mj12 and there's another kind of like nine page guidelines

124
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
I'll actually maybe in

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,600
The the discord post that but so there's references to the ipu and of course the ipu the interplanetary phenomenon unit

126
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,880
I know I

127
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,040
Glanced by that my last video. I'm actually probably going to explore that in the different topic like two

128
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,640
Three letter agencies that are kind of unknown in another video coming soon

129
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:56,320
The ipu was referenced so the mj12 purports the original crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that operated with banna bar bush

130
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,280
Robert j. Oppenheimer even albert einstein

131
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,800
And the thing is these were all labeled hoax by fbi

132
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
You know if you look at mj12 documents and you look at this

133
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,640
I think it's the cia root reading room. You'll just see bogus written across the documents

134
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,160
There are hundreds if not thousands of mj12 documents

135
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,800
All talking about protocol like the somo one the special operations manual about what to do when a crash team finds biologics to

136
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,480
A craft to operational protocol to just discussing cases like the isenhower briefing document in 53 that discusses the 1950

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
El indio del Rio case and so forth

138
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,520
So basically the mj12 is the biggest question of are there legitimate documents?

139
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,440
Recorded in the public realm for the crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that dates back to the mid 40s

140
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
And that's just the simple answer. There's so much more to get into there's so much intrigue

141
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,640
So many of the classic ufologists stanton freedmen lennard stringfield bill more

142
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,680
Grant cameron

143
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,240
All these guys have talked so much about mj12

144
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,520
So I could keep talking about mj12 forever, but we'll say that probably we'll see

145
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,640
But the the the thing is philippe

146
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,240
If I want to see results in this field

147
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
I got to be willing to

148
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
kind of do the hard work that

149
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
a lot of people don't want to do and

150
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,080
You know to to what ends who knows dangerous, maybe I don't know but

151
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
This is subject is just too important to me to kind of

152
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Play the safe road and I appreciate you watched everything. Thank you. It's a ton of great videos coming up, man

153
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,200
A ton. I'm really excited. I can't wait to get back in japan the council boys

154
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,520
Uh, oh, I think I know who it is. Thank you for the euro's brother

155
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
Hopefully you're able to go to the manchester card next week

156
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,040
If you are let me know because that actually sounds awesome

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
And I'm going to be really jealous except you'll have to be up at like 4 a.m

158
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:05,520
Great job on the recent videos random question. Have you given any thoughts of the alleged Costa Rica sightings in 1971 and the 2007 razor photo?

159
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,120
Yeah, actually the 71 photo if I sorry, let me get a sip of my gate or powerade

160
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,920
If I'm uh, correct here the 1971 photograph was taken from a

161
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,880
geographical coastal mapping plane and it depicts a classic saucer from an elevation of

162
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Between 10 to 25 000 feet

163
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,920
That's a classic picture. I know it's been referenced a lot by people like uh, linda moulton

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
I think linda moulton howl but and so forth

165
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,520
Or sorry leslie keen. I'm sorry, but that is interesting. So is the razor video

166
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
It's really hard to do an analysis on the razor video because there's so few

167
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Frans in which we see the craft

168
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,880
And I know so so if you guys don't know what the razor video is

169
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,080
It's supposedly a costa rica video of a saucer shaped uap taken in 2007 off a flip phone think a motorola razor

170
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,680
This depicts a craft sitting in kind of like a cavern

171
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,480
Resting resting resting quickly the camera shows the craft go belly up like bob lasar describes and fly off

172
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,560
Now the the big kind of drama here is people asking if

173
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,200
A little laxative pain. I didn't even notice that but oh you commented last time and max pain's a great game

174
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Especially mass max pain three

175
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,520
But so that the the big controversy around that video is some people surmise that the craft is just something suspended on a string

176
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,520
And that's sort of the the jerking motion. So that requires some analysis, but it's it's tried to um

177
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
It's it's difficult to to study that

178
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Edward lin

179
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,160
I have actually not heard of Edward lin. I'll be completely honest

180
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
So if you can tell me who that is

181
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
I'd love to know

182
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,760
Big fan of your efforts. Thank you very much. I appreciate that

183
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,440
just

184
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,960
Trying to have everything I do that I can be open source and

185
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,560
You know have the documents for everybody to read themselves and so forth

186
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
I think in the future, I'll probably make a website just because

187
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,440
Over time the cases get a lot more complicated and I reference a lot more

188
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,840
So I'd like to have a website with each case log. Maybe a transcript of the video

189
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,280
Maybe some snippets like when I reference a clip like David grush talking on jre because

190
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,080
You know, if I want to hear David grush talk about stargate, I can only have 30 seconds of footage before I might get

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,840
My butt hit with copyright

192
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,520
So I'd love to have that stuff on a website where there can be a little bit more context to add it in for people who prefer to

193
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
read

194
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,880
What's your opinion on whether or not humans can handle disclosure? This is actually a very good question

195
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I think about this all the time

196
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
I oftentimes like to say yes

197
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,760
But you know, what exactly are the uh implications of of

198
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,520
Disclosure there's already so much negative discourse in the uap sphere in general and how people look at this topic

199
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,400
Uh, sometimes I have to step aside because you know, everybody I talk to are

200
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,120
The fine folks who watch my channel and so forth everybody who has an interest in uap

201
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,400
Who likes to study uap who has a pretty good case log in their brains of cases

202
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
But you know when I'm at jujitsu and people come up to me with it

203
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,520
Hey, you get you have that ufo youtube channel, right and they start talking it

204
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,320
I think the average person the public just thinks

205
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,800
Even they're still on the the question of are ufo is real, right?

206
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,720
so

207
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,640
When the vast majority of an american populace is just still asking the question if ufos are real

208
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm not exactly sure how

209
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Well, a populace could handle the

210
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,520
Kind of looming presence of a non-human intelligence on this planet

211
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,920
So it's a multi-layered question like we could probably talk about this for hours and hours, but i'm not sure

212
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,160
Uh, what's going on with the skinwalker ranch having the presentation or something wilder side?

213
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
I'm actually going to talk to jesse michael's about this. Um

214
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,360
I have talked to him a little bit about it because he spent some time at skinwalker ranch

215
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
I don't think he saw I don't think he said he saw anything weird

216
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,920
But I think he said he experienced like just kind of weird poltergeist phenomena as people call it

217
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,040
So I need to talk a little more about that, but it is

218
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,720
Rather funny with dr. Shawn Kirkpatrick that image from 2018. He looks like a kid who got his hand caught in the candy jar

219
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Does he not he is glaring

220
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,880
Glaring at the camera. I've never seen a man look so furious. So

221
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,840
You guys know my opinion on dr. S. K. I've made videos or made that video a long time about him

222
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,240
And since then there's only more to discuss

223
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,320
And so forth. Why does this subject interest you so much? Have you ever had an experience possibly jason?

224
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
I've possibly had an experience just like everybody. I've seen weird lights in the sky things make

225
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,080
Making turns at 90 degree angles zigzagging across the sky

226
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,680
But I cannot say concretely that i've seen a definite form of a craft

227
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
I've talked about this a little bit this subject

228
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,000
It has been my primary interest since I was old enough to read one of my first ever books was a book on the betty and barney hill incident

229
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,360
I remember reading that when I was basically in diapers

230
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,680
and

231
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
I just

232
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
This topic is so weird to me because of the abundance of

233
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:07,360
information cases documents testimonies to kind of immerse yourself in

234
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,600
But the vile reaction people have back to discount. This is just a common conspiracy. So

235
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,040
I think what really interested me first was just the the idea of contemplating UFOs and then

236
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,160
The amount of evidence for that juxtaposed with the stigma that has been created. So

237
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,880
When I first started my channel, I was mostly interested in just kind of creating a pretty comprehensive database of cases and footage

238
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,960
For people to reference but as I move on I'm more interested in actually doing whatever the heck I can to

239
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,280
Help disclosure, however, I can in any way I can do that, you know, it's tough. I'm not a military guy. I'm not a

240
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
politician but

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, so I figured my route

242
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,680
uh, just like some people before me like Ross could be through journalism and

243
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,920
Just trying to inform the public tell herms. Yes, I do and in just a few minutes. I will drop the link in the

244
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
In the chat

245
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
Mighty moh, thank you so much. It's okay that you're late to the party

246
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
You haven't missed too much. We're just kind of talking through questions just chatting

247
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,080
um

248
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
and

249
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,640
I would like do you have any book recommendations for me for my trip to japan?

250
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
um

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,680
So you can email me at uapgurb at gmail.com. I'm a little bit behind on emails just with how busy I've been

252
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
So i'm also going to be doing that on the plane

253
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:34,320
Again, that's uapgurb at gmail.com or I will post my discord invite here in a couple minutes

254
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
fat rodents

255
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,160
Subs we need to keep gerbs gerbs producing

256
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,000
comment

257
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,080
He just said he's a mechanical engineer by day job. Keep him producing. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the support

258
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm just wondering I had an nde tell me about that

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
I you know the the more you immerse yourself in this

260
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,760
Phenomenon kind of the more interesting and the more you move outside the traditional nuts and bolts of fields to study

261
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
So I'd like to hear about that

262
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,080
What are your thoughts on grush being so quiet recently? I do not think that he's not that it's

263
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
I

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
I do not think that it's because of laziness or

265
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:19,600
Not interest. I think that the best avenues for for grush to affect change right now is probably doing stuff behind the scenes

266
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
This in my opinion has probably worked with

267
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
congress lawmakers

268
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
and so forth I

269
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,520
I think he he did what he needed to do in the public with his ross colt hart news nation interview

270
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,920
His appearance on jesse michael's and his j re appearance. I

271
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,200
I mean in those besides his op-ed, which I still do believe is is on the way

272
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,720
um

273
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
He's pretty much

274
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,800
Talked about everything he can publicly, right? So I think the the mostly what he's doing is behind the scenes kona

275
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,880
Please email me at uap grow about gmail.com if you have and I haven't responded. I'm just a little bit behind because

276
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
So dang much going on

277
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,680
And thanks before I continue. Thank you guys so much for asking questions and chatting

278
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,520
um

279
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,400
I really appreciate it and I love talking everybody. I'm trying to get through every single one of these because I'm very honored

280
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
Pitchforks are coming 30 years and millions of reports later

281
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,960
I hunter believe that they have been here since the dawn of mankind. I don't need anyone to approve what I believe

282
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I like that mindset more and more

283
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Grush has talked about this as well and many other people talk about the antiquity

284
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,320
Of the phenomenon, you know, you have the 16th century nuremberg lights

285
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,400
With all sorts of shapes dancing around the skies of nuremberg triangles

286
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,480
weird crescent shaped craft and so forth

287
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
all throughout history like the uh

288
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,680
I'm trying to remember like the chariots of juda back in the 11th century in a in a

289
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Middle eastern war

290
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,360
If bob lasar is to be believed one of these craft was found during an archaeological dig

291
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
Many people who

292
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,880
Have a good basis of of credibility to stand on talk about this phenomenon being ancient

293
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
And I certainly would probably agree

294
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,680
patrick

295
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,280
Have I looked into emory smith? I have not i'm going to write that name down because

296
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Any sort of

297
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,320
Uh investigation I haven't done I would love to do

298
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,120
Everyone comment on this defeat the algorithm. Thank you op tv. I appreciate that too

299
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,960
I I just you know, if I if I need help, I'll reach out to the community. I know

300
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,120
I talked about this in the last video, but I I wish I could get content out faster

301
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,400
It you know, I like

302
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
I want the creative process to be mine

303
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,600
So I do everything from thinking of the idea to researching to writing the script to filming to editing to posting

304
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,800
So I appreciate the patience with all this and you know, if I need some

305
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,680
If I if if I need to reach out to people I absolutely will what can the average

306
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Working joe due to legitimize the subject more. That's a great question. I mean, um, what I would say personally is to familiarize yourself with factual data

307
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,560
Understand the usg's history and studying the uap phenomenon

308
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,600
Understand project grudge signed blue book the controversy around osap and atyp uap tf and aro

309
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,160
Talk about the unknown unknowns. All of these programs have registered the obfuscation of data the stigma

310
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,000
And when you bring up this subject at least what I'd like to do in public is not just to

311
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,560
Jump to okay. There's non-human intelligence on this planet

312
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,960
There's reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs, but it's just say wait slow down for a second

313
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,160
People are still arguing about our ufo is real

314
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Well, here's how the u.s. Government has studied ufo since the 1940s

315
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,840
And then you can reference the condom report not the 1969 out of cu boulder condom report

316
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,000
But I somebody told me I said this wrong conding condom

317
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,560
The british mod ufo study that actually referenced the 1989 uh belgian ufo wave of triangles

318
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,520
You can also talk about all the australian ufo reports if you're interested in that

319
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
I think it's my us over d1

320
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,760
I linked to the internet archive where I referenced a couple australian

321
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
uso reports there's a full archive there

322
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,880
And then you can talk about canadian uh lawmakers talking about five eyes nation studying ua uap together. So

323
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I would just talk about

324
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,920
stick to

325
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,000
Introducing people to get comfortable with the fact that ufos aren't just a conspiracy

326
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,720
Because the stigma has been so dang success successful at doing that

327
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,400
Um, yes, sir jujitsu and mixed martial arts. I love jujitsu

328
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Uh, I had training today

329
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,040
I might have got a little bit of a concussion because I was doing technique with a youngster

330
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,480
He was trying to do a fireman's carry threw me over the back shoulder hit the head a little bit. So hopefully it's okay

331
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Thank you. I appreciate that

332
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,600
I think disclosure will cause the ontological shock we've heard about to religious people

333
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,360
But non-religious people it's an easy pill to swallow. Uh, I've actually I've liked how the vatican has handled

334
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,080
Uh discussing this topic in the last couple of years talking about I think they said that god paints with a broad brush

335
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,720
You had a catholic priests at the uh last july congressional hearings with grush

336
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
so

337
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,800
I hope I like I hope non-religious people can handle this but at the same time, you know, what are

338
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
how's the average person going to

339
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,680
Just react in general when they find out that there is a presence on this planet that

340
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,120
Operates completely different to humans their modus operandi probably still not given out if there's full disclosure why they're here is unknown

341
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,400
How many of them are unknown where they're coming from unknown? Just kind of the fact that they're here. Um

342
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Yes, I do know who mitiokaku is

343
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,640
Uh, I would love to speak to him if you have a way to talk to him. I would really like to talk to him

344
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,880
I have a book of his I can't remember what it's called

345
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,840
But I've always really enjoyed his appearances on j re uh talking about the phenomenon

346
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,720
They've been here

347
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Pitchfork, they've been here forever. Nothing will change. I hope I hope that's not the case

348
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,320
We are at a pretty pivotal pivotal point in disclosure. I think there's been a couple times where

349
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
there has been

350
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
We've been pretty close to

351
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,160
Sort of disclosure events, but then moved away for various reasons

352
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,160
So I hope things can change now

353
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,920
It partly feels like the genie's a bit out of the bottle with people like grush coming out and so much kind of attention on the

354
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,240
UAP subject. I know it's still a little niche

355
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,960
After all the the excitement died down from the congressional hearings, but let's let's hope with the 2024 ndaa

356
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,840
Um, we can continue that. So how do you rationalize what custodian? I don't know who custodian file

357
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Or uh, I don't know who custodian file is

358
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
So please tell me if you can

359
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,480
This is a great question on a sliding scale

360
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,840
How confident are you that michael herrera is telling the truth? This is so michael's such an interesting case for me to talk about because like

361
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:17,200
With the stuff that joey always talks about kind of the extra evidence that michael has of talking to the insider and so forth

362
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,560
It really is one of the most compelling pieces and I can tell you

363
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,800
I had a really weird moment where I actually came across this insider

364
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
completely independently

365
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
In my own research on another project

366
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,160
So that was really kind of weird for me. And no this insider is not anybody i've i've ever covered on the channel

367
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,680
I think somebody commented recently on youtube was uh, the witness i recently spoke to was he michael's insider

368
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and no he was not but

369
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
I am

370
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Of course, you can't prove

371
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Indonesia although although

372
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
although

373
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,000
I am talking or I need to set up a call with somebody who may have some interesting information on

374
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,800
On indonesia back in 2009. So there's an individual. I haven't been able to connect with him yet because i've been so busy, but

375
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,640
I'd like to talk to him. He says he has something interesting to talk to me about the sliding scale on the high side, brother

376
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,600
Love the idea of the website. It would be a lot easier. Yes. Also. What is the best way to help support the efforts?

377
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
Of course, like

378
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
So I have I have a patreon

379
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm not going to continue

380
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,040
I'm not going to advertise it too much until I feel like I have a wealth of content that can keep somebody

381
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,760
Busy for hours hours on end or until I'm able to get like a weekly live stream and so forth where we can discuss cases and so forth

382
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,480
So uh for now if you would watch the videos and share them I that would be

383
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,920
I would love it. I would love it. That would mean everything to me

384
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
To people who can't think past that are they going to invade us?

385
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
Yeah, I think a lot of that

386
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,640
I always think back to the twilight zone episode to serve man or the invading alien force

387
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,520
eats people

388
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,040
so

389
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,880
Yeah, the the question of invasion

390
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,880
I hope just because that's been so discussed by hollywood with films like independence day mars attack and so forth

391
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,160
I I hope people can start to move past the idea of being invaded by an ny species because

392
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
people always like to talk about the moniker if

393
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,520
If they wanted to invade us they already would have so I I I struggle to kind of wrap my head around that but at the same time, you know

394
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,760
Uh non-human intelligence. It's almost impossible to attribute motives to something that doesn't possibly has

395
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,360
No relation to human consciousness or synapses. I don't know. That's a it's an interesting question

396
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,480
In his latest interview that came out the other day sk tried to play the skinwalker ranch presentation down even more you can

397
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Yeah, ever since that, um

398
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
fugal came up with that photo

399
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,680
so

400
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,480
Remember green street had that basement office episode or not it. Sorry. I'm sorry

401
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,440
He had the interview part two with sk right and that was moved back like a full week or two

402
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,960
I I sincerely think that episode was moved back

403
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,000
Slowly to do damage control on that photo because the entire second interview was just talking about how sk

404
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Didn't know about that presentation

405
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,040
And he was kind of blindsided by it and he was just asked to be a consultant on it. So yeah

406
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,120
Sk as the kids would say he's kind of a dweeb whether we can handle the disclosure or not is irrelevant

407
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,800
If people believe gravity, it's better to warn them not to jump off a cliff. I yeah, I I am one for

408
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,440
Kind of what guys like rush a that they're still oversight necessary if there are retrieval

409
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,320
and uh reverse engineering programs

410
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:53,200
I think rush at it. I just rewatched his jre interview. He said that nuclear physics are available to study in an undergraduate course

411
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,960
But the mechanics of making a nuclear weapon are classified

412
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,400
I

413
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:04,160
Like to think in that ran the same realm of thought around uap still humans and the general public deserve

414
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Disclosure about what is visiting our planet

415
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,520
Possibly where they come from and how they operate. It's their their modus operandi if it's known

416
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,160
But if still technology needs to be kept away because of various potentials of it. I still understand

417
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,040
The public was yeah, um, I grush talked about this as well. Um, kind of

418
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
For a forgiveness window for people who may have committed blue collar crime

419
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,000
In program duties, whether that be, you know, hiding away funds racketeering embezzlement

420
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,400
bribery

421
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,680
threats

422
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,840
anything he says when it comes down to the harm and

423
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,800
Possible murders that people need to be locked up an ab

424
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,120
Absolutely, if people have

425
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,360
affected human lives and ended them in for this subject. Yes, they do

426
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Have you heard of

427
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,520
Daniel Salter alien contact intelligence?

428
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
No, I haven't I'm gonna write that down

429
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Daniel

430
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
Salter I'll check that out, man. I've never heard of it

431
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,360
Do you have any posts? I do not yet. I'm still there are a lot of investigations. I'm trying to work on now

432
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,120
in the future

433
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,400
Kind of I'd like to start talking about kind of a ongoing case logs in the in the patreon

434
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,400
So have you ever looked into the connection between ny and psychedelics such as dmt?

435
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,320
No, I have not the only thing I know because I have a memory like a hawk

436
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
Um

437
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
Is alex jones in 2017 on jre

438
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,240
talking about various government organizations using

439
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,280
Dmt to connect with some sort of non human intelligence in the spirit realm. I have not

440
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,840
I know that I have some family members who have experimented with dmt

441
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,880
And I know some of the stuff they have seen is wild in terms of just uh kind of leaving

442
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Not really existing in the human

443
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,000
Realm of thought anymore. So no, I haven't looked into that but it's very interesting

444
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,200
If they're able to travel to this this planet at will that they probably probably do, um, how you been I have been

445
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,840
Amazing

446
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,040
Thank you very much. If anybody's kind of new to the stream

447
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,640
I'm doing this because tomorrow I am taking a trip out of the country

448
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,160
So I just wanted to chat with everybody because of course I won't be able to get a video out

449
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,120
But I have a lot of projects coming back. I actually might

450
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
See what people want to see first

451
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
So on the agenda is

452
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,880
I want to do a video on the interplanetary phenomenon unit combined with another

453
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,480
Very shadowy unit that might be a little interesting to cover

454
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,160
I want to do a video on the kalahari incident if I can talk to bill more

455
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,040
Of course, I need to get to kexburg. That's one of the biggest ones the 1941 cape gerudo crash

456
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
I want to talk about scalar technologies

457
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
um, I want to talk about

458
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,040
Ryan wood and the mj-12 and I might also be meeting doing a little trip with uh, mr. Jesse michael's

459
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Maybe we can collaborate on a video

460
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
That'd be awesome. I would love to do that

461
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,480
So you've shown evidence where hundreds of millions are allocated to black programs

462
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,720
But that's chump change for something like this. How can you explain the disparity?

463
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
yeah, I think that um

464
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,600
I think that I've just pointed out in some videos like a small number of contracts just to start kind of

465
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,080
illustrating a point in terms of especially when contracts are allocated where employees of various companies have said that

466
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,080
These large contracts don't have any kind of movement within them

467
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,920
And so forth. I know that kathryn austin fits in the 1990s

468
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,840
Who talks about the gao failed on it by the pentagon talks about billions upon billions upon billions missing in funds

469
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,040
So I just tackle this at a smaller scale, you know

470
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,800
Even I can't really conceptualize the billions and billions of billions that go into black programs

471
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,440
That are kind of unaccounted for so I just like to analyze from like a small small contract by contract basis and so forth

472
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,200
Uh, how do you make sure that you don't fall down the rabbit hole too much?

473
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,360
And I'm sure you keep grounded but still open to new data

474
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,000
That's actually probably one of the best questions I heard. I I know of of course a couple

475
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,240
YouTubers and so forth who cover this topic who have just kind of like struggled. Um, you know, like

476
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,560
Studying this so much can have adverse mental health effects

477
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I've seen and not just from youtubers but from authors and so forth. So

478
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
To stay grounded. I think

479
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,920
One needs to have a life outside of uh studying uap and for me that is

480
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,120
Of course jujitsu, uh, my lovely girlfriend traveling

481
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,840
You know, you can be immersed in a rabbit hole. You want the second you go, uh,

482
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,240
Somebody tries to strangle you be kind of snap out a bit and are able to stay a little bit grounded

483
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,280
but

484
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,800
I think part of the the biggest thing now to kind of get trapped with the kind of

485
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,960
Misinformation and so forth is to really take my time to digest what I'm hearing

486
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,760
And to see how much of new information I can cross reference to existing cases existing documents existing

487
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
kind of knowledge out there

488
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,720
The vetting process in this field is so hard. There's so much misinformation so much misinformation that

489
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
You know, just got to do the best we can

490
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,080
treading very carefully

491
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,720
It seems plausible that psychedelics remove our filters that keep us from seeing paranormal phenomena

492
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, so my family members who are actually into psychedelics

493
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
have talked about like the

494
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,840
Brain being a tuner for for human consciousness

495
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,480
So I'm trying to remember what they said they talk about how a brain is

496
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,400
essentially a tuner for human consciousness and on the psychedelics that

497
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,760
uh

498
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,520
More information is is taken in by your your filter your brain which it lets you exist in three dimensions

499
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,200
I'm trying to think this this still kind of new territory for me as you guys know

500
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm not always try to be really honest about that. Um

501
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,280
Kind of a big nuts and bolts guys so still trying to learn trying to

502
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,880
Kind of understand some of those mysteries of consciousness and so forth a little more

503
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,000
Uh cracker jack. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I will use this to

504
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,640
Train for two days at Kodokan judo in tokyo. So I appreciate that

505
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,800
LC the d.o.t. Can't account for half a test is trillions worth of assets. Yeah, trill. Yeah

506
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Please

507
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,600
Uh, do a video that covers thomas beardan and ning lee. I've heard both of these names before are they

508
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,440
associated with ning lee. I'm trying to remember. Let me know but I I absolutely will

509
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,040
Do you think the story about the good guys versus the bad guys inside the program is a form of diff's information

510
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,480
So people uh thread water loose focus researching dead ends

511
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,440
uh

512
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
I'm not sure. Uh, I

513
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,440
Logistically within a these programs like this it would make sense of kind of

514
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,880
Interfactionalities and so forth people who advocate for disclosure

515
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
And people who kind of want to keep the the the lid on disclosure

516
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
um

517
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,880
So that's actually a really good question. I I'm just trying to think of how I can best frame my

518
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
answer

519
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,000
Uh, do you good guys versus bad guys a form of disinformation? I

520
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,400
I don't necessarily just due to the amount of first hand people who have come out and

521
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Just said the same thing that there are many elements within programs who will almost stop at nothing to

522
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,840
Prevent any sort of of disclosure from from popping out. I know that answer is not great

523
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,040
But I actually want to think a little bit harder on giving an exact

524
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Reasoning for that question because that's a great question

525
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,160
Grush was busted for at least three years. Yes, this is absolutely true interviewing 40 plus people

526
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Years of research and data acquisition

527
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,080
Um, Colt Hart knows where one is at. Yes, he does

528
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,960
I would love to know where that giant thing is buried. I would love to know but I understand why he can't talk about it

529
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm very excited for imminent. I have a

530
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,720
Copy pre-ordered. I'm really excited to to read it really looking forward and anything Dolan puts out

531
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,920
I think we can all agree Dolan's one of the best of the best anything Dolan puts out is is so worth reading

532
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,240
Jeff if we've known that nha exists. We have acquired in reverse engineered off-world technologies for 70 years

533
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,200
Why would we be wasting billions looking for microbes on mars or searching for exoplanets? This is assuming that uh various

534
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,560
agencies like nasa the the the main components are aware of reverse engineering

535
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
programs if you go by some of the

536
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,440
The discussions that have been talked about these programs are so sequestered away and compartmentalized

537
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,400
Very very very very few people kind of under understand what's going on

538
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,760
um, and that would kind of be uh, my realm of thought

539
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,600
Is that if technology has been successfully reverse engineered?

540
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:46,640
It's not like your mission directors at nasa or or funders on congressional staff for nasa are exactly aware of kind of what's going on

541
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,640
I think the uap updates are like waiting

542
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,800
Give me elder sorals elder scroll six, please

543
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,440
Please because starfield uh was not great

544
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,840
Have I seen the infographic show about the strange encounters? Yes or or uh not on

545
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,760
Big foot stuff or squash to be honest. I've never really looked into any like cryptid stuff

546
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,880
My mind has always been on uap. However. I think I've watched uh, of course everybody knows the the youtuber wendig you

547
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,360
And I think I've watched this uh cryptid iceberg a few times and of course that's great, but I've never actually done any

548
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,160
Uh serious research into that

549
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,040
That's not my uh, that's not my realm of of of study

550
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,200
Put a lot of weight work. The weight has always been I appreciate that. Uh, hopefully to to stay on that path everything

551
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
that I put out will have research and um

552
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Ashing behind it

553
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,000
Yes, actually I will do something on this. I know I'm a bit late the kona blue

554
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,120
Deserves one of those dives where we go in line by line, especially just because it's it's such an interesting, um

555
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,680
Program proposal and how it relates to big low aerospace and so forth

556
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
How do I ask question?

557
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
Amog you can just um

558
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
You can just write it out here and

559
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,400
Yeah, you just did. Yeah, just say anything and I will respond

560
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,200
Conden report us condyne. Thank you. Yeah, I I get flak all the time, but I I can't pronounce most words

561
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
it's just because uh

562
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
I don't really know how to talk

563
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,240
Ecology, welcome. Welcome very much

564
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,680
Respect your that's a cute guinea pig bgj and ma martial arts. Thank you very much. You're a cool, dude. Um

565
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,680
Back in dc. I'd like to go to dc. Of course, there's so many people out there. I'd like to talk to um

566
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
And just meet with so if I ever am I'll let you know

567
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
The vatican knows something they have history locked away, which means maybe it's for a good reason

568
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,640
Yeah, if you go by grush speaking about the 1933 magenta case

569
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,960
information upon the crash uap was back channeled to the us by pope

570
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,720
I can't remember but by the sitting pope at the time

571
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,560
um

572
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,240
The best way to de-stigmatize is just to have conversations about what people think on the topic

573
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,720
I often just mentioned how our government is crafting legislation. I think that's a great point. Yes

574
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,840
Talked to the 2023 2024 and ea a

575
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,760
Um just these sort of conversations where you know people immediately want to jump to aliens and craft or ufo's real

576
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,720
Just kind of slowing down and say hey wait. These are the facts so far

577
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,520
I think that's really important land and I think that's a great point

578
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,960
The powers that be are making panic moves. I sure as heck hope

579
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,720
The panic moves if they are doing it aren't too uh jarring because that could lead to some danger

580
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,600
When you see one at under 24 feet, you don't need oh tell tell me about that experience

581
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,880
I'd love to hear that that sounds like an as close of an enclosed encounter as you can get

582
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,200
I've had many people come forward about something they've heard or read about the topic

583
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,800
Yeah, yeah kind of once people understand that you take this topic seriously and once they can understand

584
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,600
They don't really have to be embarrassed most people will will tell you a story they had like I had a guy at

585
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,120
Jiu Jitsu this was a couple weeks ago once he found out about my channel he came up to me

586
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,400
He said you know what I like I was biking in new york back in the early 90s

587
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,480
And a huge triangle flew over my dad and the uh, so it's just really interesting the the stories these people tell

588
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,200
Phone cameras i'm not so sure about that if phone cameras don't seem to be too good at capturing much

589
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,120
The dolce base is real or disinfo that is a really good question. I'm not so I'm not sure

590
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,720
It seems like there's a little bit too much known about uh, dolce

591
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:33,920
You know there seems to be a bit too much publicly available. I'm trying to remember the uh, the ufo highway ebook by

592
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,120
Crap what's his name? I can't remember but who interviews colonel x who talks about everything in dolce

593
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,480
Maybe dolce is a red herring. Who knows? Uh, it's

594
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,240
It's a tough question. I sir. I don't have enough

595
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,840
Knowledge on dolce to have a really informed

596
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,440
opinion

597
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,040
No, I think birdie asked this too last time with tim taylor. No, it is not

598
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,120
Unless you have the phone. Yeah, that's true. Okay, uh

599
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,240
Road pirate films custodian file is a channel on youtube

600
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,160
He posts videos and records from cameras he had on his roof and he often captures videos objects following planes and helicopters

601
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,720
Oh, I'd like to check that out. That actually sounds really interesting

602
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,480
I'd like to look at that footage. I don't watch uh, too much footage anymore

603
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,720
I know that I've covered uh, two footage cases mostly. I just kind of skate documents and

604
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,920
And so forth a footage isn't my number one focus right now, but I I would like to

605
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,280
To to keep going on that. Sorry. Some sightings are literally five to ten seconds

606
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,960
For leaving. Yeah, love twilight zone twilight zone is great, man. If you've watched the original 50s twilight zone

607
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
fantastic Ben

608
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
One of the contracts you mentioned

609
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,800
loved one thing I wanted to mention is that a lot of the contracts you mentioned may be

610
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,440
Availability public to research. Yeah, but the internal investors as

611
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,640
SAIC sites took down all those those contracts, but in my video notes

612
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,600
I do have secondary public places where you can read about those

613
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,480
Contracts. Sorry, I should have said that in the video. I'm sorry, but for each contract that has been taken down

614
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,280
I have different links that are still publicly available to look at them

615
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,400
Sighting lasted tell me about your setting to pitchforks. I'd love to hear about it

616
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,880
If they wanted to invade us they would have done it, uh, so this uh, yeah

617
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,360
Not nukes and launching rockets into space

618
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,000
Ethan, what do you say brother?

619
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,360
Too funny was just watching your precious videos in your live great investigation. Really interesting to see more

620
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,600
But I don't know if that's that's fear. I that was I don't know

621
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,040
But the Ross coldheart video with that sphere is really interesting. Yeah, I've watched bits and pieces of this

622
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,920
This was a really great interview. I'm not familiar with the engaging the phenomenon host

623
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,120
But you know, if if anybody is close to him tell him that that was awesome. That was a really great video

624
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,120
It was uh, I think that

625
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,120
Semivans quote that's making the rounds about the phenomenon the truth to it being indigestible is really interesting

626
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,600
There is a new interview with shonkirk patrick from news nation

627
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:11,760
You know, I thought after the steven green street interview that shonkirk patrick wasn't doing more interviews. So

628
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,000
Why why is he doing another interview torum and

629
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,960
okay

630
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,000
I think sk is a trained intelligence officer if he can't get away with plain dumb and intentionally not looking at things

631
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,560
He will yeah, what's his what's his quote?

632
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,440
Expect me to lie as an intelligence officer. You should expect me to lie to you. I think you said that

633
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,560
Have you investigated cold fusion aka low energy nuclear reaction scalar physics? No, I have not I'm currently

634
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,680
Right now behind the scenes. I'm trying to uh educate myself a little more on the physics

635
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,360
I know that sounds funny coming from an engineer that I don't really understand the physics

636
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,160
But I really haven't spent much time uh researching physics of of of this stuff and I'd really like to so I'm trying to educate myself

637
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,440
Before I speak too much on a topic. I'm not too educated about no one is above the law. I agree

638
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
sk was the di

639
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,040
DIA during ossa an atyp. Yes, he was

640
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,080
What's the best way to support my work right now? Just watch the video share it with your friends

641
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,400
Please if you learn something talk to people about it

642
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
uh people should be

643
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,240
Uh discussing this subject because it's so interesting and uh, I hope that over time

644
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
There's just not as much

645
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,920
We we can we can do our part right now to decrease the stigma around this topic. We really can

646
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,160
I've seen clips like the three frames that was and I've only seen some stuff scrolling through twitter

647
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,800
And and that was uh, that was really interesting. I don't know. I haven't dug into that very much

648
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
These seven years have started up

649
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,320
Any time these last seven years more. Yes more. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. There's kind of been uh

650
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
This is a period of time where there has been

651
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,560
almost uh

652
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,800
Irreversible movement in the realm of uap

653
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,560
That is the uh, so infiltration by hybrids that is the original work of david

654
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
Ike right who talks about

655
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,880
I think it was him who who originally thought of uh, reptilians and so forth. I I've never

656
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
Really kind of dug into that topic

657
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,160
Uh, what is my favorite ufo k slash whistleblower?

658
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
whistleblower

659
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
Um ufo case

660
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:36,240
That's a good question. Uh, uh, let's think my favorite case. Of course, this would be a crash retrieval. Uh, I just think

661
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Hmm

662
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,040
I'm not going to do a cop out by saying roswell because that's everybody's favorite taste

663
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Hmm

664
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
I

665
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,760
really like

666
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
Just researching and reading about the 1974 cayome mexico case

667
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,080
I really like shag harbor. I really really like kexburg. Um

668
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Right now let's

669
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,640
Favorite case right now at this moment. Let's say kexburg

670
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,960
whistleblower

671
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,320
Of course, I think in everybody's heart. I've talked about this before I try not to talk about them too much because I'm sort of

672
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,840
Blinded by bias because I want to believe him everybody's favorites bob lasar

673
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,240
But again, I I don't cover him or ever reference him in terms of like, okay

674
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Like this case might be valid because remember bob lasar said this but because I want to believe him so badly growing up

675
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,240
What bob said just captured my mind so much but favorite whistleblower

676
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,120
of course

677
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,120
Probably one that I've covered

678
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,800
Who there was some a little bit of controversy around that's not technically a whistleblower that did not want

679
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,720
That said that his story was not true from where I found it

680
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,960
A little bit

681
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,000
I find daniel solter is a documentary called the UFO the greatest story ever denied and it's only short segments

682
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
I emailed let me check it if you email it to me and I missed it. I'm sorry about that

683
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,240
I'm pretty behind on email. So I will get to that

684
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,640
Much love from norway keep up the good work. Hey, thanks, man. I was just in norway last september

685
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,040
I went to jevick and oslo. I love norway

686
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,280
mj-12 is interesting ryanwood has yes, yes, right?

687
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,480
This is why ryanwood is the person i'm going to meet with on this because ryanwood is the best person

688
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
I know about mj-12

689
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,760
In my recent video when I talked about the non terrestrial science and technology the committee on that I

690
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
immediately reached out to ryanwood

691
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,680
And i'm going to be discussing with that with him more when I get back from japan i'm going to be meeting with him

692
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
So i'm really looking forward to that

693
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,360
What are the thoughts that we talked about this a little bit before and make sure you 70 I think I'll probably stay clear of that

694
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,960
For now just because of the the drama and stuff around that one thing I hope I hope you guys know for me

695
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,360
It's I really don't want to get interested in like

696
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,880
Like social media drama. I don't like that

697
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,320
There's no grounded. There's thousands of ny hi stories around the world if just one is true. Yes, there are

698
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,120
thousands um

699
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,680
Back a while ago some guys at jujitsu brought up that heat map

700
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,360
Of ufo sightings and pointed to the fact that the us was the most populated region even though it was a us study that

701
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,200
generated this heat map of

702
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,760
The coagulated ufo sightings and so forth and all you have to do is look at the hundreds of if not thousands of stories from

703
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,080
All around the world. There are so many rich stories. I'm hoping when i'm in japan

704
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,600
I can talk to some kind of local people of I can't speak japanese

705
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,040
But if some people speak good english ask them about local ufo stories

706
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,120
Pentagon still hasn't really passed an audit by the previous gao standards. I researched that a while back

707
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
Anything else?

708
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,080
Yeah, this is a great a great point

709
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:48,800
I'd probably recommend to anybody just some take some breaks have some hobbies outside of uap

710
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,040
Watch some good movies watch some science fiction watch some interstellar

711
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,200
Watch the expanse

712
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,880
Just be able to chill out for a little bit. I know that's important for me at least

713
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:06,960
What would some people are talking about saps disclosing we have people all throughout space literally a breakaway society?

714
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Yeah, that's a that's a really interesting

715
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Concept the the idea of the the kind of breakaway society as people reference to the reverse engineering programs

716
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,360
That's a lot too

717
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,200
Lot to explore sorry

718
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,240
I got caught up with this profile picture not the name my family

719
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,920
Does support me my mom's the best she always watches my videos and wants to talk about the cases so she's great

720
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,480
Come up to kexburg, you know what?

721
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,480
I actually would like to when I cover kexburg. That's actually a good idea. I would like to try and get boots on the ground

722
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,040
Uh, that actually I'd like to do that more. That'd be uh, great. I'd like to do that a lot. Zach. What's up, brother?

723
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,080
Any videos you think could be legit ufo's england from 98? I'm trying to think about that

724
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,800
So I use this a lot in my b-roll footage

725
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,400
One of my favorite sightings there's two sighting here

726
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,360
It's not the green triangle from tom DeLonge

727
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,040
But it's that individual's triangle sighting of the three-pointed triangle with the the red circle in the middle

728
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,680
That takes off at very fast speeds. I haven't done a full analysis on that but I

729
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:19,360
Really really really love that footage. I'm still I'm still kind of uh back and forth on both fly by and

730
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,680
The metapod I think the metapod might have a little more credence, but those still I'm still kind of trying to uh

731
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
Trying to think through a little bit. All right

732
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,960
Salvador paiz looks familiar and I may have worked with him in the power and propulsion division at navair packs river

733
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,320
Holy cow

734
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:42,160
If you were working at packs river in the propulsion and power division you very well may have that is really interesting

735
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,880
Uh, if you remember anything about him, let's talk. I'd love to hear about uh paiz

736
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,400
Let's all head out to skinwalker ranch and eat a bunch of mushrooms

737
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,880
That all sounds fun and dandy until the filming crew kicks us off the land

738
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,840
Ryan thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. We will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure

739
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,080
Caught a yes. I hope so that that is going to be one of my uh greatest missions to try and do

740
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,200
Are there any associations between weather and UFO sightings? I actually I actually if I'll be honest

741
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:18,320
I have no idea. I really don't um, that's a that's a good question to ask if there's any variable weather padding patterns and mass sightings and so forth

742
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
I I do not know

743
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,200
Uh, what are your thoughts on the coast to coast am interview with victor alleged?

744
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,200
as foreworker who smuggled footage out of the alien interview tape, uh, I know that there's a lot of

745
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,640
Discussion around that. I think it's that's uh, john stewart

746
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,120
That's uh, john's the case. John stewart is working on is it not um

747
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,360
I

748
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,000
There was a weird connection between that and calahari I read today

749
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,640
In terms of in like file notes for referencing calahari

750
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,400
I am not quite sure. I haven't spent too much time. I know there's a lot of controversy around the video

751
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,360
But somebody recently was like doing an analysis where they inverted colors to track like pupil

752
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,440
Tracking on the supposed bean. It's it is that is uh, that's really interesting

753
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,120
So I would I will do a little bit more studying and kind of get back

754
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,040
Crade thank you. Thank you, man. I appreciate that and I'm sorry my answer to your question about

755
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,680
Why I do not think that good guys first bad guys is misinformation

756
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,600
I'm actually gonna I'll do a community post about that in the future because that's such a good question

757
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:34,320
Golden is dolin is the gold standard. I completely agree. Uh, dolin and colt heart and lenard lenard string field are my inspirations

758
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:40,560
Especially lenard string field that man's a legend. If you haven't read crash retrieval, uh one through seven

759
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,480
I highly recommend it. Leonard string field is an amazing individual

760
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,920
Why do you think he hasn't spoken recently? I do think what grush is doing is work behind the scenes

761
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,440
I'm not sure how much he can contribute to to a public discourse right now unless there's more senate hearings

762
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,480
I'm not sure what else he can say publicly

763
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,120
Uh to pass dopser that hasn't already been said, but of course. I don't know grush

764
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,480
Uh, but I would like to know what do you mean pitchfork? Everything you said is a lie

765
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,040
john s

766
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,080
My man, thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. I agree with starfield. Yeah, I played a little bit of it and it kind of

767
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,280
Stunk 2017 prey. No, I really want to play that. Uh, if any of you guys here play games

768
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,640
Let me hear what you play. I love I love me some games. Um, so I would like to play

769
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,640
Starfield

770
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,640
I'm sorry. Sorry. I mean prey

771
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,240
I heard recently

772
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,320
Pine gap is a pretty decent location if you go to greer's dpi archive

773
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,080
And search and look at pine pine gap documents

774
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,320
I think he has two witnesses talk about pine gap and a facility there

775
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,720
I've also heard from some other individuals that pine gap might be the location there

776
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,360
There was some interesting stuff around a korea location

777
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,080
But I also talked to a guy who was pretty familiar with kind of fai and fight transponders and stuff

778
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,080
And he kind of talked about the purpose of that facility and

779
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,480
He said that uh, that korea location may not exactly be it

780
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,600
Looking cut. I appreciate that man. It's just the lighting. I'm a bit of a I'm a bit of a jelly roll right now

781
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
I do that so I can smash people in jujitsu

782
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,240
Path of exile a couple of my buddies play that they say it's great. I might have to

783
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,480
Speaking on behalf. Thank you for watching. I really appreciate that guys

784
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,000
This is all governments do is lie and then shame me for questioning them

785
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,600
You go. Yeah, I mean, uh, in many respects governments don't really have the the public's best interest in mind

786
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,880
I'm still waiting on some quality alien video

787
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,480
They are here looks cool to have atmosphere, but it'd be awesome to see something ground based on the current knowledge and culture

788
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,600
Yeah, I'd love I'd also love, um

789
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,560
if we could ever get access to the, um

790
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,720
satellite images that both grush and melin have discussed

791
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Uh high quality satellite images showing uap

792
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,400
You're great to be an interview with a grush and alizano. That would be

793
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,600
Absolutely, that'd be a classic that'd be an absolute classic. I'd love to see alizano talk more

794
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,640
Huge fan of his interviews with kerch. I'm mongolo on the theory of everything. Those are absolutely fantastic

795
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,640
If you haven't watched those I highly recommended and if you haven't watched, uh, David grush's jre appearance

796
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,280
I highly recommend that too. I watched it, uh

797
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,040
Thursday for like the fifth time

798
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,800
I actually have some problems with joe on that interview if i'm being honest

799
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,760
Joe really kind of worships the ground guys like bob lasar and travis walton walk on right

800
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,240
He always talks about bob lasar and his credentials

801
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,400
But he kind of was acting a little bit negative towards grush, which was really interesting to me. Um

802
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,640
You know

803
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,360
I I just I didn't really like how joe handled that interview

804
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
I just might brother. Thank you

805
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,960
Toby I appreciate that. Um

806
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,760
I would like to

807
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,720
Uh, I would like to try and stream like once a week

808
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,240
That would actually be really fun. I'd like to do that. Are there links between her era and r.a. No, there are not

809
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,440
If you talk about danger like the u.s. Military is I mean the

810
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,560
I hope not man. I'm not

811
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,600
Like the u.s. Military. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a point

812
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:21,040
U.p. Show up in ir. That's why regular cameras don't capture them. Yeah, I've heard this too. I I can't remember. What's that gentleman who?

813
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
showed up at the um

814
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,760
He showed up at the sci conference

815
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,840
I can't remember but he's starting like a startup to track uap with various systems

816
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,360
I I can't remember this young man's name, but he's seen his work seems really

817
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:41,760
Promising toby. I talked about that a little bit earlier. I talked about uh the interesting aspects about

818
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:50,080
The the insider and that this case is difficult or I don't won't talk about it too publicly too much anymore just because I like

819
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,280
It's difficult to talk about this case without referencing kind of like the the evidence and so forth

820
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Joey has talked about about this insider and so forth

821
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,400
But as I mentioned earlier, I was able to also kind of analyze this insider or find out about this individual in a roundabout way

822
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,720
I've seen two ufo one in texas one in houston. Tell me about him and I'd love to hear with it

823
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:19,120
I agree with watching much footage, but user five posted and read it in youtube some extremely compelling videos using the thermal camera

824
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,520
I'll check that out. I I would I of course love watching footage. I just don't um

825
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
I don't I just don't uh like

826
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,000
Focus too much on it, but yeah, I'll absolutely watch hackology. I'm an active mod of many subs due to my interest

827
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I would love to send you my sightings. Yes, please

828
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,440
um

829
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,040
uap girl about gmail.com. I'll be spending a lot of time kind of looking at

830
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,160
Uh, kind of catching up with emails on my flight to japan

831
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,160
Are there con?

832
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:50,560
Are the contracts classified from government sites? I do not know the government sites would probably won't hear about the contracts

833
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,680
Jimmy, thank you very much. I really appreciate that and that's a really cool sushi shu. I um, thank you so much really

834
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,880
They're here and they take whatever animal person that they

835
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,600
have invaded long ago, so

836
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,160
I think it was colm kelleher that stated I'd like to know what you think about this. I think it was colm kelleher that touched on the

837
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,960
cattle mutilation and said that he his personal hypothesis was that

838
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,000
There was some sort of agency detecting detecting like

839
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,120
preons and local prions preons. I don't know. Okay. I'm sorry. I can speak in local cow population

840
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,480
What do you think about that?

841
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:33,600
You've seen the ner off website. Yes, I don't maybe not the a new version. I don't know. I could have checked that out, man

842
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,480
um

843
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
There's a government site of all

844
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,920
If there is a government site, I actually haven't found it. I usually find contracts on private company

845
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,520
Their various investor websites, so if there is I actually need to find that

846
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,640
We I ever make a video on the disclosure act 2.0. I probably will not and here's why

847
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,560
Actually, I haven't covered the original disclosure act. There's only minor differences in the disclosure act 2.0 the same

848
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
numerous references to

849
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:10,880
non-human intelligence legacy programs crash materials the 1954 atomic energy agreement classifying uap material as clans

850
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,600
Trans classified for a nuclear material

851
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,120
And that is how much of this has not been disclosed because anything that's new nuclear secrets doesn't really need to be disclosed

852
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,720
So maybe I will just because I haven't even talked about the first act in general

853
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,440
And at the point where see their breakaway civilization that are group keeping the locked away for good reason

854
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,200
um

855
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,800
yeah

856
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,800
I understand the um

857
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,160
I don't I struggle with the good reason. I think back to the

858
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,120
original news nation interview with ross colthardt

859
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:46,160
And grush said one of the reasons for this being kept secret was feudalistic dominance. Uh, I can't think of a good reason behind that

860
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,600
What are your thoughts on ai?

861
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,920
Being a part of the phenomenon. Um, I'm thinking back to section five behavioral analysis from the flyby footage from that

862
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,680
a

863
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,560
leak that occurred on I think it was 4chan that I

864
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:09,360
Still don't have really a place for um that talked about basically some craft being sort of an advanced model of of uh ai

865
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,920
I don't know. Um

866
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,680
Grush had some interesting things to talk about ai on jre too

867
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:24,240
and and especially his worries of of using ai offensively in in uh adversarial systems basically dropping the ai

868
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,160
expecting it to perform but then kind of not really having uh,

869
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,120
Not really having hackology. I just got your email. Thank you

870
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,880
But not really having a way to kind of control the ai. So ai is rather frightening

871
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,080
Uh, how it relates to the phenomenon. I'm not quite sure but I uh, I don't know

872
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,800
Have it dig into silicon-based life like is suggested. Yes, there is a great youtube

873
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,480
I watched a really good youtube documentary on silicon-based life

874
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:56,480
And there is a really good like a graphics-esque, uh youtube channel. I I can't remember

875
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:04,080
Heck, what is the name? I'll find it. No, I'll plug it. But yes, I have silicon-based life is extremely interesting

876
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,800
Um

877
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,120
So what are your thoughts on the lani's amora case?

878
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,680
Yes, I would love to cover more of the classic cases. Uh, currently

879
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:20,080
I'm looking at interesting parallels between the lani's amora case craft and the calahari desert south africa in 1989

880
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,080
alleged crash retrieval

881
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,160
if you look through some of the uh,

882
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,480
Military documents alleged military documents that were recreated discussing the 1989 craft the crash had similar

883
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,040
Symbology from the lani's amora case

884
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:38,400
So I do want to cover that because now I'm I'm really interested in kind of that symbology and so forth and trying to understand that

885
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,240
Abductions, what do I think about uh,

886
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,480
Stephen Greer to evil humans being michael akino the leader of this set temple

887
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,000
Greer is a bit of an enigma to me if I'm being honest

888
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,120
I'm not quite sure about so many of his motives and it's weird because so much of his research is brilliant

889
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,160
And then so much of what greer has done post

890
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,600
You know a certain date wherever we can find he started to do some some interesting stuff

891
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,240
Abduction cases are really interesting. I kind of mentioned earlier one of my first ever cases. I read about was betty and barney hill

892
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,760
um

893
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,040
So and of course, I know travis walton many of the famous cases

894
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,280
They're really interesting. I don't know what to make of them to be honest. Um

895
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,880
I what interests me is the intent behind

896
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,960
abduction, so I would want to uh, I would really kind of want to backtrack and

897
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,760
Try to find context around the abduction and try to determine motives as to why this happens

898
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,040
But abductions are really interesting and they're extremely frightening

899
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,320
To think of if you guys have seen fire in the sky, I know it's a dramatization about travis walton's case

900
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,520
The scene where travis walton is uh, basically experimented on fire in the sky came out in 93 is terrifying

901
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,520
I believe bob, let me know what you guys think about, uh, lasar, of course lasar is such an interesting case

902
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,680
Hopefully we can get to the bottom of his case

903
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:05,920
Again, like what I said is he's tough for me to talk about because I am just so biased in towards bob

904
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,880
I want to believe him so bad. So it's hard for me to take an objective lens because you know

905
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,840
I'll see problems with bob sesame. I'll say yeah, well, maybe this because I I want to believe him so darn bad

906
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,400
Toby, thank you very much. Uh, I I'm trying to get through everything. I'm sorry if I'm slow guys. I know I can ramble

907
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,000
Do you think consciousness is tied to the you I've heard that maybe these vehicles could be controlled with consciousness

908
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,160
And so can you elaborate on how you view consciousness?

909
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,440
A while ago if you asked me I probably would have said no, but over time more and more cases I follow

910
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,720
There's more and more kind of link between human cognition human consciousness and

911
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,880
UAP some of the claims that vehicles can be controlled with consciousness

912
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,160
Of course, you have Michael talking about p Michael Herrera talking about p3's but also backtracking a little bit

913
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,200
You have uh, ross colt heart talking about kind of consciousness interface with controlling craft

914
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,160
You also have the infographics whistleblower fees to be real

915
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,560
That retrieval teams need to have basically grounding mechanisms. So their brain isn't distorted by the phenomenon

916
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,680
You have Gary Nolan. You have Jacques Valet. You have

917
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,040
Lou Elizondo who's discussed this and you have many more who have talked about issues with cognition and

918
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,040
various problems that occur with the human mind encountering UAP

919
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,200
um

920
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,040
So at this point, I do think there is a link between consciousness and cognition and UAP what it is

921
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,920
I don't know. I really don't know and I'd love to find out because remember i'm coming from a realm

922
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:34,960
A science realm where you think of of synapses and stuff in in the driving cause between the human brain

923
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:39,440
But more and more I studied this phenomenon the more and more there's a strange link between these

924
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,960
Hey, griff, when's the next iceberg episode? Would you guys like another iceberg episode? I don't want to like

925
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,520
The thing is I don't want anybody to be disappointed when I put out a release

926
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,160
um

927
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,560
I would love to make more iceberg because it's kind of fun to put a little bit more human a little bit more

928
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,960
Or a humor a little bit more of a personal spin on stuff

929
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,200
But if you guys don't like the icebergs, I won't do it. But if you guys want to see some icebergs, I'll do it

930
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,720
I also

931
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,200
Maybe I'll wait till 10k. I'm going to do the taxonomy from carl nels deleted slide

932
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,800
Just talking about every single possible origin of nhi

933
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,120
so

934
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:20,240
Uh apek arts parts and analysis and their thruster experiments. I have not ch, but that sounds really good. I'm gonna write that down

935
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,040
Thank you guys if whenever people

936
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,320
Put stuff out like this for me to look at I really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart

937
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,720
Uh

938
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,160
If you had to estimate the amount of people who have been part of a crash retrieval reverse engineering team

939
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,760
What do you think the number is?

940
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,800
This is total guess, but I'd say relatively

941
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,040
small like

942
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,040
In history maybe below 500

943
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,400
In my guess you ate your crash retrieval teams the personnel on them are probably highly highly highly specialized

944
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
and if you look at

945
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:02,640
Remember recently I mentioned that uh christopher sharp article about the oga and jsoc

946
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,480
Joint special forces operations command if some of these crash retrieval operators are jsoc

947
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,680
They are highly trained and those don't come a dime a dozen

948
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,600
Ecology mj-12 fifth annual review uh written

949
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,200
I need to look at the if was that written by ryanwood

950
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
I gotta look at that

951
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,040
Rattle rattle. Thank you so much. We need to support you. Thank you. I appreciate that very much

952
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:33,760
Um, sorry, let me I'm a young richard dolin. I thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Um

953
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:40,320
I he's a true inspiration hunting victor the documentary tell me i'ma write that down

954
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,960
I will download that and watch that on the plane

955
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,960
I

956
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,240
Play minecraft minecraft is great bro. Everybody loves minecraft

957
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,560
Wow, I would love to play wow, although I think I would lose my holy cow. Are we just getting to the the games?

958
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,200
I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. Uh

959
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,960
I'm sorry. Uh, I'm taking so slow a lot of people have called greer grifter neglecting the important work. Yes

960
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,040
I agree. This is why I talk

961
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,200
In almost every video about the 2001 disclosure briefing document

962
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:19,920
I think that piece of literature is brilliant and a must read if you haven't I highly highly highly recommend it

963
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,920
It's fantastic

964
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,760
Have you ever read inside flying objects by michael p masters? No, I haven't but michael p masters is really interesting

965
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,800
I'd like to uh, I'd like to get into a bit more of his work

966
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,280
You are a beast

967
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,320
bjj and i give you those guns. No, I just lift a lot of weight. Thank you

968
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,360
What are your thoughts on steven greer? It seems like uh

969
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,040
Ever hey, do you want so I've talked about greer a lot

970
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:51,120
Uh, I have mixed feelings on greer because I don't like how he charges thousands of dollars for ce5

971
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,040
And I don't like how he self-aggrandizes himself in his witness stories

972
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,680
A good example of this is michael herera's case when michael herera discusses

973
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,640
That he was held at gunpoint by these men

974
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
the black operators

975
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:11,920
When he observed the ufo greer likes to take it a step further by saying that he was made to turn around and get on his knees

976
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,720
Uh, basically thinking he's gonna get shot in the back of the head

977
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,480
So greer likes to kind of control these witnesses a little bit

978
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,840
It seems and kind of aggrandize the stories when it makes a little sense to make them seem a little bit more sensational

979
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,080
Sensational however at the same time

980
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,560
Stephen greer has done exceptional work for ufology exceptional work

981
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:37,680
2001 disclosure briefing document is a fantastic piece. I so recommend reading that the greer witness list

982
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,080
I talk about this every time I reference the subject these people need to be separated from greer himself

983
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:49,760
Okay, just because they're contacting greer their case a lot of people say oh like he's in contact with greer

984
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,800
We shouldn't look at his case. No these individuals deserve to be analyzed just as much as anybody else

985
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:02,720
Some of the work greer has done is excellent. There's a top line summary in the disclosure briefing document that talks about the program back in 2001

986
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,800
I I find it and I'll post it, but it's fantastic. I'll actually do a community post on it. Um

987
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,520
What are your thoughts on ai as an aspect we talked about that a little bit have I watched professor simon holland's

988
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,520
I've heard of professor simon holland, but not orford ness. I will actually get into that a little more

989
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,920
um

990
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,160
Once a spook always a spook and I remove that comment with the word line. Yeah, once a spook always a spook

991
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,680
Hey, man, really enjoy your detail oriented videos remind me of think anomalous who covers some of these cases when he sometimes includes details

992
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,360
Other researchers overlook. Thank you very much. I really appreciate those kind words

993
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:44,160
He's in project gravitar with little zars input coming out this year s4 recreated in vr in crazy detail. Yeah

994
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,520
um, I know on the project gravitar website or kind of some of their promotional material

995
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:55,760
They have screenshots from the craft and that's really interesting. Also mac mayve studios has a great video inside

996
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,480
Inside area 51 and s4. I've used some b-roll footage for that

997
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,360
I'd really like to collaborate with that dude because he makes some awesome stuff. But yeah, check that out. That's great

998
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,760
Greetings from chile. What's up, brother? Thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words

999
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,880
Trying to give you money. It's okay, man. Well, thank you for having me on patreon. But I

1000
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,400
Thank you so much day after raswell is core. So yeah, I'm sorry. I was looking at that. I think the raswell incident

1001
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,400
That's bill more come to think of it

1002
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,760
Game recommendations. You can never go wrong with doom 2016

1003
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,560
Doom plus doom eternal. Yeah, the doom games are fantastic to zealot. I hope you're still here

1004
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,080
God of war ragnarok is fantastic as well. I can't wait for that new doom game

1005
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,720
Games games. I'm trying to think is no games have really caught my attention too much lately

1006
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,080
I'm gonna replay ghosts of sushi ma if you haven't played that that's an excellent game. I can't wait

1007
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,960
UAP humanoid encounters coming out of peru. No, but I know that ross coldheart just did a video on that

1008
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,120
Those are pretty interesting. They talk about beings that like melt people's faces off

1009
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,920
Of course, I can't discount anything. I just haven't done enough research to have a very informed opinion

1010
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,920
It's very interesting though. And I'd like to listen to that reality check episode that talks about this

1011
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:09,440
Um, what are your thoughts on the nascar mummies? I post this website last time because I talked about it on a recent video

1012
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,160
You should check out the 3d scans of all the mummies

1013
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,520
You can kind of go through the the different layering of them. It's super interesting

1014
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,200
And guys in about 15 minutes. I'll have to hop off. So I'm going to get through everything because I got a pack

1015
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,200
I haven't I haven't packed um

1016
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,920
Huckology. Yes, I have and I will post that as well. What do you think about pyramids in Alaska?

1017
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,400
It's one of the price locations remote view prior to his death

1018
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,120
uh, the remote viewing is

1019
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:39,520
Yeah, Alaska is a very mysterious land. I've heard of a possible reverse engineering locations in Alaska as well

1020
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,920
I think Alaska is a very mysterious land. I

1021
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,480
Don't know. I don't know maybe remnants of an ancient civilization in Alaska. I don't know

1022
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,080
I do not know but that's a good question fat rodents. Thank you so much watching this with buddies

1023
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:59,520
We'll tell your slimes as the kids say I say hi getting money. Thanks. Hopefully. Thank you very much. I appreciate that

1024
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,440
Got a jet

1025
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,920
Well, you probably signed off but have a great night, bro

1026
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,080
I'm sure that you've seen yes, I have seen the beaver utah footage

1027
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,000
It's pretty interesting, but I haven't given it a full analysis like I I don't want to just say like

1028
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:19,280
I think this or this without uh, really thoroughly looking at something. Um, but you know, I will take a take a harder look

1029
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:26,400
Listen, you know, actually that would be kind of fun if any of you guys want to kind of get together and play some games together

1030
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,720
I'd love to do that. Colm said there seemed like there were two groups. One had the laser tech trying to go through

1031
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,480
Uh, imitate mutilations. I had not heard that. Thank you for clearing that up

1032
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:41,280
I've got to look into that as well. Say get employee. What is your day job? I am an engineer. I do mostly qa

1033
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,480
Engineering these days and it's very boring

1034
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,640
If you see any clear ufo company, yes, uh, jennanette is fantastic

1035
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:56,160
Someone sent me one of his videos, uh, recently and they're really great. I would highly recommend

1036
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,800
But have you blocked s but he's on mj 12. It's really good

1037
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,600
No, I have not

1038
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,920
No, I will read that. Thank you

1039
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,840
Finally caught alive is the ufo news dying out. No, I do not the mall incident. No, I do not think so

1040
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,160
I think with the 2024 I think after congress recesses in august as this issue is voted on

1041
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,680
We'll see a lot more interesting things and I think with lulis ando's book coming out

1042
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,080
We'll see a lot of interesting things

1043
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:27,680
Ethan Simmons. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Enjoy japan. I'll see what other data. Thank you very much

1044
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,840
I will use this money to feed myself some delicious sushi. Thank you so much

1045
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,600
Uh, let me I'm trying to go fast guys. I'm sorry. I'm so slow. No sweat

1046
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,280
Why would these uap let themselves be seen?

1047
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,480
I don't know attributing motives to the phenomenon if you've read jock valet's book dimensions and passport to magnolia

1048
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,040
it seems like sometimes the uh

1049
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,040
It seems like sometimes the uap either want themselves to be seen once it disguised themselves as other things or so forth

1050
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,560
Attributing motives and understanding. I really don't have any idea. I really don't I'd like to understand more

1051
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:07,120
What about the young guy's tracking, uh, ronnie vernet? No, he was just with reality check yet

1052
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,120
No, the the young man. I who is tracking you a photo or

1053
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,080
Uap with his equipment. That's not him. I just can't remember what his name is

1054
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,720
Uh, you on reddit should have posted a live chat. That's all right, man. AJ green. That's the famous

1055
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,800
Excellent bangles player. Good name. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yes

1056
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,840
I will be covering the maje brazil crash and I will hopefully be able to be using mac maves studios footage on that

1057
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,400
absolutely

1058
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,440
uh

1059
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,440
No, I cannot

1060
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:45,840
The um first australian's triangle shaped constellation a group of triangle shaped. Okay

1061
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,600
Basically, so three stars in the triangle formation. Did they move at all in the formation or did it stay pretty uniform?

1062
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,240
um

1063
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,240
One sec. Sorry guys. I'm getting a call

1064
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,520
I

1065
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,920
Sorry guys

1066
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,960
My bad. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to skip over that

1067
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,120
UAP being controlled mostly by a mic's perfect sense also the craft piloted by actual biologic nhi

1068
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,880
It was heavily declines the 60 70s and 80s nowadays nowadays mostly ai

1069
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,480
So yeah, that that kind of boils down to like the von neumann self replicating probe, right?

1070
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,440
I talked about that in the infographic show. That's a pretty interesting uh idea john michael godier

1071
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,440
Who's a great he has a great youtube channel who talks a lot about kind of

1072
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,560
uh

1073
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:34,480
Fermi paradox extraterrestrial intelligence and so forth talks often about how von neumann probe is a very applicable solution to

1074
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:41,440
uh spreading the civilization basically and into its own galaxy without violating faster than light travel

1075
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,240
and so forth so the the some

1076
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:48,480
Many uap being controlled by ai does make sense if we think to that infographics video

1077
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:54,000
I think it's just like the basically the uh saucers and possibly triangles that are piloted such things as bells

1078
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,120
Spheres and so forth are are mostly drones

1079
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,840
Capital s pattern. Oh that is interesting

1080
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,040
It is always it is extremely interesting when you see something

1081
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:11,760
In the sky that is exhibiting flight patterns that you when you start to notice one of the five or six observables of uap

1082
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,760
And assigning this super interesting

1083
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:20,080
One of the best since it made up the story to get out of it. I've heard that too and if that's the case those men are some of the

1084
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:25,280
smartest people alive to make up a uap abduction story to get out of a contract

1085
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:31,600
I believe bob and there's a lot of things that were corroborated, but only is the education thing

1086
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,760
Yeah, I think the education thing is a little too uh

1087
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,960
Played out a little people focus on that too much. Of course, it's a valuable thing to use

1088
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,280
To kind of talk against bob, but people bring that up too much. I believe

1089
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,160
Uh

1090
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,240
You have one of those signed too. Yeah, that's what you can't see here is the the reactor

1091
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,280
Uh, and how the the sports model works too. This is just an excellent piece

1092
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,240
psionics. Yes

1093
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:05,600
Lazar is definitely a friday can email you all the proof study tis and type please please uap gur about uh gmail.com if you're still here, man

1094
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,080
I I would like to to read that a lot

1095
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,960
They can mess with our brains experiences

1096
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,920
Correct stan freeman didn't like lasar. Yes

1097
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:19,760
Yes, or stan freeman did talk against lasar quite a bit. I'm getting to the iceberg stuff

1098
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:26,880
Okay, a lot of people are interested in the the iceberg. So yeah, I will um, I will get to that a little bit

1099
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,040
So, okay. Yeah, tommy. We talked a little bit about the face peelers

1100
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,200
uh

1101
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:38,160
So if you're interested in jsoc look into the the squadron the 24th st. Yeah

1102
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:45,760
Yes, there was somebody on reddit recently like a supposed whistleblower case somebody in the 24th sts who talked about his captain

1103
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,480
Who was pulled away for very specific duties?

1104
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,240
Occasionally and one time he talked about seeing some sort of craft that he said wasn't ours and was very shook from it

1105
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,400
That's a really interesting story. I believe I have that downloaded if anybody wants me to share it with them

1106
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,920
Cracker jack, thank you very much friends have different monies. Thank you very much

1107
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,960
I really appreciate your support on the bottom of my heart

1108
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,360
How many things see uh, see fives or a thing? It's just

1109
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:18,720
I don't know. I need mods. I I'd like mods, especially as kind of the channel grows for this stuff

1110
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,400
but

1111
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,400
you know, the thing is like

1112
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,240
Everybody who types here is either wanting to talk to each other or talk to me

1113
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:33,040
And I feel like I'm doing people a disservice if I'm just having somebody else filter out what they're saying like if you're typing out a

1114
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,200
Message specifically to say something to me

1115
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:43,840
You know, you are supporting this channel and I owe it to you to look at what you are saying and respond and think about it

1116
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,960
so

1117
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,000
mods

1118
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,320
Mods be damned for the time moment. Um

1119
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,240
I think that was our brain wash similar to benowitz. That's interesting

1120
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,440
Uh, see over yeah, I I'd like to the gentleman who said he would talk to um

1121
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,400
Or send me that information about lasar. I'd like to look at that as well. Greer is clearly a narcissist

1122
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:09,040
I thought you said gerb for a second man. I was like, what the heck? But yes, I agree gerb rules you roll telekinesis beats

1123
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:15,200
You're truly a young dolin. Thank you so much. Greer was an only option for many witnesses. This is an excellent point

1124
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:20,640
I'm sorry for getting to this late. Greer is has been for many people the only option

1125
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:26,560
Can I link to the greer briefing document? Yes, I can I'll make a community post on it. Okay

1126
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,280
Posted on reddit. Thank you very

1127
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:36,960
Yes, I've thought about this too. Um lasar after the congressional hearings did uh, I told you so but he hasn't testified

1128
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,080
The heineck ufo report is excellent

1129
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:46,480
Uh, the cia ufo paper is also excellent. I have not heard or I've not read ufo's generals pilots and government officials

1130
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:51,360
I absolutely will I've linked to the ufo report and the cia ufo papers in a couple videos

1131
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,920
So if anybody's interesting those I will watch it

1132
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,720
The uh, okay hunting victor not out yet. Okay, but I will watch it when it comes out. I didn't know uh,

1133
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,480
Or jog flay. Yeah, I has also mentioned that bob that he had to whoa

1134
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:10,320
Green okay. Yeah, I need to study up a little bit on on that more because that's a pretty interesting theory

1135
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,800
NASCAR mummies

1136
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,480
He says slimes

1137
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,520
Yeah, dude. I I'm still I still try to try to uh, not act not act too old

1138
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,600
Do you have any really good uap videos? We might have seen I talked about this before but one of the videos

1139
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,720
I think like lives in my head rent free is the video of the black triangle

1140
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
I include a minute much of my b-roll footage

1141
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,040
Check it out in my locky martin video

1142
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:36,480
It's a footage from a handheld camera of a man taking a video of a black triangle in his backyard that exhibits four lights

1143
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,120
One light at each vertices of the triangle and one

1144
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,880
Uh, uh red light middle it takes off at a high speed at the end of the video

1145
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,680
I don't know if that video is real or not. I'm not advocating for its credibility, but it's really interesting

1146
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,240
What's up with the phoenix lights?

1147
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,640
fantastic case uh the

1148
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:58,160
Conventional explanation is the a10 warthog flares, right? But then uh pipe or

1149
01:23:59,040 --> 01:23:59,760
What's the dude?

1150
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,760
What's the governor's name who came out and said he

1151
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,120
Was disappointed and how he reacted and coming on stage with an alien suit talking about the phoenix lights

1152
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,680
The phoenix lights is one of the most interesting cases we have in the public domain in my opinion

1153
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,840
What do you think about the four-chan whistleblowing that claims about ufo's? Yeah, so he talks about ufo's being made like a

1154
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,920
or

1155
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,920
respect per purpose that

1156
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,200
Four-chan whistleblower is insanely interesting and I will

1157
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,400
Still cover that full thing at some point because

1158
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,080
I love that that story. It's just really interesting

1159
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:38,720
Mods are not a good policy. Oh, oh, thank you. Tommy. I appreciate that brother mods are not a good freedom

1160
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,440
Yeah, that's the thing too like

1161
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,960
I really don't want some uh random person kind of telling people what they can and can't say

1162
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,640
uh

1163
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:54,480
You know, I don't want that howdy from lumberton texas. What's up, man? Thank you very much for joining in vegetable gremlin

1164
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,040
It it can feel like that. Yeah, uh

1165
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,360
UAP feels like it never ending circus. I I empathize with that and I understand

1166
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,880
That's why I think it's so important to kind of pick and choose what you're studying at once

1167
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,960
You know, you see with a lot of questions people ask me

1168
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,360
I'll be pretty outright and say I have no idea what I think on the topic because I haven't studied it

1169
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,760
In this field spreading yourself too thin is a

1170
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,200
massive detriment. It's really a massive detriment. So

1171
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,920
focusing on what you like to specialize in

1172
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:29,680
researching that branching out occasionally but really trying to focus in on something you can make really good progress

1173
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:35,120
My specialty what I like crash retrievals reverse engineering and speaking to witnesses

1174
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,600
First-hand witnesses that is what I like. There's so much more in this domain outside of that

1175
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:46,400
But I'm spreading myself too thin and probably being a little bit demoralized if I were to do that because I can't focus on as much

1176
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,440
I have a playlist

1177
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:56,000
If you look over it help you navigate the electromagnetic. Yes, please please please please send that to me uapgrub at gmail.com

1178
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,880
Please I I'd love to review that on my flight

1179
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,560
It's a great time to be alive might

1180
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,280
And also it yeah, it is this is what an interesting time to be alive

1181
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,240
Aquedia. Yeah aquedia Peru

1182
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:20,160
Uh, I'm trying to think why can't I remember what case aquedia Peru is I've referenced it before but my mind is given a blank

1183
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:27,600
A deep dive in a deep dive on if s4 was real I was went to the black at the idea that the bus would be 30 knots on hook

1184
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,720
Uh, so one of the best

1185
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,920
I want to do a deep dive on s4 and I have a fantastic document

1186
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,440
I want to reference for that

1187
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:42,800
It is the project Aquarius document that talks about dan barish and gives a detailed layout of all seven layers of s4

1188
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,880
And I do want to cover that

1189
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:51,120
I've been yes, um tenkai, please I I'd really like to read your research

1190
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,880
5th simington. Yes, that's the names 4chan story seems to check out

1191
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:01,040
Uh, yeah, when he talks about the spheres in that he talks about them being like a hammer design, right? So

1192
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,040
uh

1193
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,920
Keep reading it. Okay. I've seen

1194
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,480
uap

1195
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,480
I've seen uap once at night three lights flying around rapid speed coming to an instant stop

1196
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,120
okay

1197
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
That is that is a very interesting case

1198
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,160
So you saw three lights flying out of rapid speed

1199
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,480
Coming to an instant stop

1200
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:28,160
Changing colors and intensity and jumping like a mild and instant instantly continue done its previous path

1201
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,560
That is extremely anomalous

1202
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:37,840
Uh, oh I'm with the okay Puerto Rico. Yes, that is the case where there's uh, yes. Yes, okay

1203
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,560
I know what you're talking about. That's the 2000. I think 18 footage

1204
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:45,440
Where the uap is shown hovering over the town goes into water splits into two and rises

1205
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,760
Uh tanner johnson. What's up brother? Yes, we are doing alive

1206
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,280
How did you become interested in the ufo topic?

1207
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,440
I think it's just the way my brain works ever since I could read one of my first ever books was on the

1208
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,920
Betty and Barney hill abduction. I've been fascinated with the story since ever I

1209
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,040
Since I could read since I knew how to think I have always been obsessed with ufos

1210
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,920
But until I reached my recent age, I didn't really know how to express that, right?

1211
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:16,720
and I finally came to a point in my life where I realized I has something to offer in terms of

1212
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,360
treating the subject like I would a research paper in engineering having a thesis

1213
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:27,360
Having a body of work having a body of references and making that into a video trying to make it entertaining that people could watch

1214
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:34,320
Try and limit as much of my personal interest in in each video in each research project as much as possible and just deliver

1215
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,400
the data

1216
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:43,120
The facts the surrounding context on a topic. So this is just such an important topic for me. Do I believe dan barish is legitimate?

1217
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,080
I don't know because I haven't done the um that dive yet

1218
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,720
And I do know some interesting people who actually have no opinion on dan barish, which is interesting

1219
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:57,360
Of course, he talks about j rod. He talks about uh j rod who uh bill u house talks about being retreated from the

1220
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,480
Kingman crash the thing is with dan barish. He talks about two j rods

1221
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,280
He talks about j rod uh ebe

1222
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,040
5 3 az which is the kingman arizona j rod. No j rod two were recovered there

1223
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,400
He says one was handed off to los alamos national labs one was given to

1224
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:18,560
Uh, what's s4? He talks that that is a p 52, you know p 45

1225
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,960
p 45 species and there's p 52 a riot species

1226
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:29,520
So I need to do a deep dive because he's really interesting. I know the the youtube channel night shift did recently

1227
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,520
So I'll probably wait a little bit

1228
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,240
um

1229
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:38,880
To let that all that die down and do like a full uh full research project. So you observed, um

1230
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,680
An instantaneous deceleration and acceleration. That is fascinating

1231
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:50,240
jimmy carter's ufo report. Yes jimmy carter is really so, um jimmy carter, of course

1232
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:56,400
Was an advocate for uap and danie sheehan has stated he performed uap investigation for jimmy carter because of his interest

1233
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,680
Can you try and vet?

1234
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:06,080
Yes, absolutely. I will do that. Um, I'll do a I will do a full research project on his claims

1235
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:13,040
Uh, his the project Aquarius and so forth because that that seems like a really interesting thing to explore op tv

1236
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,240
Um, thank you very much. I really appreciate that

1237
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:22,160
Do you know anyone approaching the uap subject from the instrumentation detection angle

1238
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:29,360
There's your channel is launching model rockets into the anomalous phenomenon launching rocket. Yeah, I don't think I don't think that's a good idea

1239
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,720
Yeah, there's that gentleman who's actually building really interesting detection software. I will find his name and I'll post about him

1240
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,920
I'm sorry. I can't remember right now, but he is the guy right now

1241
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,480
um

1242
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:45,680
That's a yeah, that's the thing it with many sightings they last so briefly

1243
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,480
You don't have time to get it on any filming mechanisms

1244
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:55,840
Mods for time management. Obviously someone we will see we will see as we as we grow we might have more people chatting

1245
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,720
The looking glass technology is really interesting. If you guys don't know what that is a danbury's claim

1246
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,200
But I think level four or five and s4. There is some sort of uh, like time

1247
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,280
manipulation project called project looking glass at s4

1248
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,920
I'm always wary of involving ebe's living amongst human. Yes. I I am too. I always just

1249
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:23,040
Taking them stepping back. Yes, uh, uh, northrop who kind of talked to I think it was

1250
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,400
I know the video of him in a garden in which he discusses uap openly

1251
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:34,400
And that is a very interesting video and when I eventually one day make a video about northrop grum and I will be referencing that

1252
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,600
Uh, dude exchanging aliens isn't like human trafficking except with a

1253
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:46,320
Yeah, it's yeah, exactly. Yeah, if danbury's is telling the truth, they're just swapping ali or et's like yugioh cards

1254
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,320
You watching for recent. I have not if there are recent metapod videos. Please

1255
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:56,880
Please show me if you guys think I'm just kind of lacking on that stuff. It's not I'm just so focused on a few aspects

1256
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:03,840
Crafts retrieval reverse engineering and talking to people golden domes. Yes, I will be talking about this golden domes from danie shihan

1257
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,760
If you guys don't know danie shihan has claimed that there's golden dome

1258
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,840
What's known as golden dome and the cias technology used to detect uap even when they're cloaked

1259
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:19,520
Thanks for the q&a. Hey, good night, brother. Good night, man. Good night from church. Nice, man. Have a great night

1260
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:26,080
Agree on the looking glass comment research. Okay guys. I will uh finish up these comments. Then I got to hit the road

1261
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,400
That's all right. I got a pack. I agree

1262
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,880
yeah, so

1263
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:36,560
Yeah, and this sort they're with danbury's there's so much to unpack it deserves a a lot of research

1264
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,760
Yes, golden domes. We will absolutely be talking about that in the future

1265
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:47,040
It was like a beacon going off on earth. They split the adamant. Yeah, that's a that's a great thing

1266
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,360
to talk about right like a

1267
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:54,000
Huge influx of uap sightings post the first atomic bomb drop. I am of the mind

1268
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,960
I do think there's been a presence on this phenomena for quite a long time

1269
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,160
Uh, how long that is I don't know but I think the

1270
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,440
If we may have lit up like a beacon with the first atomic bomb dropping

1271
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,080
I do think there has been a presence on this planet longer

1272
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,880
Since when do you have an interest in uap's forever?

1273
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,640
I've talked about this a few times brother

1274
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:18,800
But uh, I have had an interest in uap since I could think as a human and it has been one of my biggest passions

1275
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,040
And it wasn't until recently I learned I could

1276
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,800
Actually try and do good on this subject

1277
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:32,000
Just found your channel via jason juror. Who's jason shardrani if he's showing me out. Thank you, man. I appreciate that

1278
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,720
Just for the record one sighting in austin ever moved. Okay, gotcha

1279
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,440
Yes, I will cover the uap da because I never covered the 2023 variation

1280
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,680
All right, I'll get through these and then I'm stopping with aj greens coming on iceberg

1281
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:50,240
Have you ever looked in the contrail picture that when pull the pull? No, I have not but I will check that out brother

1282
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,840
What if the reason why uap is so secretive is the nh i themselves don't uh you us

1283
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,320
Disclose about their existence for whatever reason

1284
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,760
Yeah, I I mean the the fact that the phenomenon itself isn't revealing itself is telling right?

1285
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,720
Like they ultimately have the power to disclose themselves or not

1286
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:14,160
Maybe they don't trust us. Maybe we are like maybe the zoo hypothesis has some truth to it that mainly we are just a piece of study

1287
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,360
Thank you. Zach. I appreciate that man. I thank you for all of your comments on pretty much every one of my videos

1288
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,120
She hands incredible. I uh jesse michaels has an interview coming out with she hand. I cannot wait for that

1289
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,720
Hope you got a window seat. No man. I got the aisle. Um, but I'll probably have to trade for my girlfriend. So she'll have

1290
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,600
I'll have a middle

1291
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,520
Check out that. Yes. Well, unfortunately, I'll just be going to uh, tokyo and kyoto

1292
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,920
I won't be have time to go to Hiroshima or Nagasaki

1293
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,640
Fat rodents. Thank you

1294
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,160
Uh, I built a technology that allows me to send chats and live streams from the past

1295
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,280
They're super

1296
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah, what?

1297
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,080
Okay, uh, other two stars never moved up. That is very interesting

1298
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:05,600
They don't like you here. Maybe it's just an uh impartialness to humans, right? Maybe it's just not even

1299
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,800
Maybe we are to them. What answer to us?

1300
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,120
Alpha zero. Hey, man. Nice to see you live. Thank you very much

1301
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:18,080
But please don't fall into the black hole. Yes a lot of charlots and jokers. We talked about this earlier

1302
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,840
I'll always do what I can to uh, kind of ground myself and

1303
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
Kind of not fall into

1304
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:32,480
Unhealthy habits. Where am I going tokyo and kyoto? I am going to I will be training at kotokan in tokyo

1305
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,840
For a little bit of judo too. You were born in uh, yukisoka. That's awesome, bro

1306
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,560
I'm so excited to visit your beautiful country. It's been my top destination forever. And with that guys

1307
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,560
I am going to hit the road. So I'll

1308
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,280
I just feel so terrible about not providing content. So I might provide like some

1309
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,560
Community posts a little bit like articles about stuff

1310
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,920
Because I would still like to talk about a couple things

1311
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:02,800
So thank you guys so much and samuel. I see this I should interview jj. Yeah, I'll I'll talk to him

1312
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,920
Absolutely safe travels. Thank you guys and I will when we get back get right back to the videos

1313
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:12,720
And then we will also do maybe a weekly live stream where we discussed the most recent case

1314
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,360
And kind of chat about things and with that guys, I'll catch everyone later. See you

1315
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,240
You
