WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.060
you

00:31.000 --> 00:34.760
Okay, okay, I don't think I got anybody in here

00:40.560 --> 00:42.560
Let's

00:42.920 --> 00:51.140
See rewatching. Okay. Can you guys can anybody hear me? I'm trying to set this up. I'm still pretty pretty new to lives

00:54.560 --> 00:59.500
Just trying to check this out, I think we got three

01:00.880 --> 01:02.880
Okay, oh, what's up quitter? How you doing, man?

01:04.760 --> 01:08.680
Okay, what's up guys? I'll wait I'm waiting for some people to join

01:09.320 --> 01:13.000
But I just kind of wanted to chill with everybody for a little bit

01:13.000 --> 01:16.240
I know we got some good videos out some interesting cases

01:16.560 --> 01:21.320
I'm actually leaving tomorrow for a trip overseas. So I just kind of wanted to check in with everybody

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
See what everybody's working on

01:24.000 --> 01:28.320
Kind of understand what cases you guys are looking at also when I get some more people in here

01:28.320 --> 01:32.880
I wanted to get some book recommendations from everybody for my trip

01:33.880 --> 01:38.120
Good a long plane ride to Japan. So thus far. Let me see what I got

01:39.400 --> 01:41.400
Alexander I am going to Japan

01:41.880 --> 01:47.220
So I'm doing a little trip to Tokyo and Kyoto tomorrow and it's really weird being on a live

01:47.920 --> 01:53.480
Talking to myself. You're not talking to myself, but you know what I mean. So for books

01:54.720 --> 01:57.440
I'm rereading Michael Schratz

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
Crash retrievals of the third kind if any of you guys have heard of that

02:02.480 --> 02:08.200
It is where Schrat got to go through Leonard Stringfield's personal archives in Cincinnati at Mufon

02:08.760 --> 02:13.120
And he touched on some cases that Stringfield had in the crash. Oh, what's up, Joey?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.640
What up, Joey? Joey the trip is tomorrow to Japan

02:18.240 --> 02:20.240
Okay, I want to I want to

02:21.120 --> 02:26.160
Want to talk about that in a second off TV. I I also don't like flying. It's not my favorite

02:27.120 --> 02:34.120
But so tomorrow guys for for some of the the books. I mean the day after Roswell. Is that by Bill Moore, Jason?

02:34.120 --> 02:36.120
I think it is

02:36.120 --> 02:39.280
Because if that's if that is in fact by Bill Moore

02:41.000 --> 02:42.800
He also

02:42.800 --> 02:47.960
You guys know the the Grant Cameron files right Grant Cameron released all of his files recently

02:48.680 --> 02:54.920
Downloadable. He has a lot of contacts with Bill Moore. They had a email connection. This was back in I think

02:55.440 --> 03:03.000
1998 and they were discussing the Kalahari Desert crash back in 89 in South Africa near the coast of Botswana and of course

03:03.000 --> 03:06.680
the primary source for that is a little controversial with a

03:07.840 --> 03:12.800
Guy who claimed he or to be claimed he was making up his South African Air Force credentials

03:12.800 --> 03:19.320
But Bill Moore in these texts with Grant Cameron in these emails said he had a secondary source for the Kalahari Desert crash

03:19.600 --> 03:23.680
So I want to link up with Bill more if I can because he is still living. He's very old

03:23.680 --> 03:29.080
I think he was born in 42 and find out who that secondary source is because the how Kalahari crash is great

03:29.080 --> 03:30.840
if you guys have ever seen the

03:30.840 --> 03:37.200
The video from Mack Maeve and his channel got hacked is taken down. So but that's a great video for when it gets back up

03:37.920 --> 03:44.160
UFO connections to Iceland such as crash retrievals or such brother. Yes. I was actually looking at this yesterday. There is a case

03:45.200 --> 03:51.760
From the 50s if you look at magic eyes only I actually lived in Iceland for a little bit

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
Let me see if I can remember where this was

03:56.760 --> 03:58.760
Okay, it was in the

03:59.160 --> 04:01.960
Jukula rivers in August of 1954

04:02.640 --> 04:12.640
According to Ryan S. Wood one of the primary sources here is the 468 CIC detachment document titles unidentified flying objects dated October 11th

04:13.520 --> 04:20.160
1954 so oh, okay. Okay, Philip J. Corso. Yeah, that's the day after Roswell men. Yeah, I see what you're saying that

04:20.640 --> 04:25.640
Corso is awesome. I I actually haven't sat down and fully read day after Roswell

04:25.920 --> 04:29.880
Which I've only listened to bits and pieces or just kind of reference the book when I needed to

04:31.400 --> 04:38.480
Are there any reports of UFOs around only nuclear warheads artillery or nuclear facilities in general such as well

04:38.480 --> 04:43.840
I know that of course we have Malmstrom and this was with B 52 bombers

04:43.840 --> 04:48.120
But in the 50 Monat AFB that is where I think a disc shape craft changed its

04:48.560 --> 04:54.080
Its altitude in a very rapid session kind of flew around a descending B 52. That's not the case. I know

04:55.200 --> 05:00.200
So well Jimmy shoo, thank you so much for the the $20. I really appreciate that

05:00.840 --> 05:07.360
Recommend clear intent government cover-up of UFO. Okay guys, I'm gonna actually grab a piece of paper so I can write this down and

05:08.840 --> 05:10.840
What?

05:10.920 --> 05:13.280
Get that to that in a second. So

05:14.000 --> 05:15.920
All right, also

05:15.920 --> 05:20.240
above top secret by Timothy good. That's another good piece. I'm rereading tomorrow and

05:21.600 --> 05:28.200
Since I will be meeting up with Ryan S. Wood soon. I'm rereading all of the MJ 12 files

05:29.600 --> 05:34.080
Maybe can I send the link to the chat and yes, okay? Let me go through these. Sorry man

05:34.120 --> 05:38.680
What is my background and how do I get access the informants that that I give?

05:39.200 --> 05:42.240
So my background is mechanical engineering

05:43.560 --> 05:47.120
Studied in university got my bachelors in mechanical engineering

05:48.000 --> 05:53.480
Currently work in the field more less so mechanical engineering more so just kind of spreadsheets and so forth

05:53.480 --> 05:59.480
but when I started my my channel everything initially started as kind of to

05:59.840 --> 06:04.800
Talk to friends and family who had an interest in this subject. I was the guy who they had come to to speak to

06:05.480 --> 06:10.720
But everything was so discombobulated even my files were just rancid and all over the place. So I started my channel

06:11.160 --> 06:16.760
Well, how I got access to these informants was I didn't give a darn about

06:17.200 --> 06:23.760
Who I called and who I tried to talk to if you guys remember back to the UFO witnesses and so forth

06:23.760 --> 06:26.320
I would just like these guys like MS and TV

06:26.320 --> 06:32.280
I just would call people and I would just talk to them. So I wouldn't really care what sort of situation it was in

06:32.280 --> 06:33.480
I know that

06:33.480 --> 06:37.380
Now it's not really the smartest idea just a cold call because you never know

06:37.780 --> 06:42.060
Who's on the other side, but that is how just kind of brute force

06:42.060 --> 06:45.740
I I know in this space a lot of people aren't really willing to kind of

06:46.460 --> 06:49.660
Put themself if there is a firing line and a firing line

06:49.980 --> 06:51.660
But that's how you do it man

06:51.660 --> 06:56.580
It's with the the differences with Joey, of course because I made my video on

06:57.180 --> 07:02.020
Marines who got close to you to UFOs with Herrera and Wagan and Joey reached out to me

07:02.020 --> 07:04.140
So that was a difference in the case

07:04.540 --> 07:10.540
No Matthew not high-key smart AF man college was super hard for me

07:10.540 --> 07:14.300
The only classes I did really well in were Diffie Q

07:14.940 --> 07:22.100
So it's roll mama. Thank you very much. I appreciate that quite a bit and that's a cute gopher or badger

07:22.100 --> 07:27.140
Whatever it is so actually what what do you guys think about the MH370 videos?

07:27.140 --> 07:31.420
I've tended to stay away from them for now just because I know there's a lot of drama around them

07:31.420 --> 07:36.300
And especially because the videos kind of circulate mostly on Twitter and most the research is on Twitter

07:36.300 --> 07:40.620
I know that there's a lot of weirdly enough drama in the UAP sphere on on Twitter

07:40.780 --> 07:44.740
So that's not necessarily my go-to where I go to kind of look at cases

07:44.740 --> 07:49.260
I know a lot of the time whenever I hop on Twitter. I see people in in rooms just kind of a

07:50.740 --> 07:55.680
Like drama rooms or something like that. So if you guys want to talk about MH370, I'd love to hear it

07:56.600 --> 08:01.360
Yeah, this is also a good question. I see a lot of people talking like

08:01.860 --> 08:08.120
You know, how does a random youtuber talk to these people and that's a great question. I am a random youtuber

08:08.480 --> 08:10.480
but I just think the

08:10.560 --> 08:12.560
difference is like I I

08:12.600 --> 08:15.780
Just try really hard to speak to people and

08:16.960 --> 08:22.240
You know since starting the channel have been able to make some good connections and you know

08:22.240 --> 08:26.720
Talk to some interesting people and kind of gain some respects and so forth. So

08:27.360 --> 08:32.320
Like the the start of the channel right now. That's just the beginning. You know, I have my inspirations guys like cold heart

08:32.880 --> 08:37.840
And so forth and you know, I would love to over time talk to higher profile whistleblowers

08:38.560 --> 08:40.960
Talk to higher profile first-hand witnesses

08:41.840 --> 08:46.480
Do more interviews that are more documentary style. I like that versus the traditional

08:46.800 --> 08:50.400
I sit on stream yard. I guess it's on stream yard and we talk for two hours

08:51.120 --> 08:53.680
In my opinion at least from like what I like to watch on youtube

08:53.680 --> 08:58.080
I'm far more interested if an interview has sort of a narrative or documentary around it

08:58.800 --> 09:01.920
I know that's the case. I'm going to be doing with ryan s wood. Um

09:02.880 --> 09:06.640
Because I really want to do justice to mj12

09:07.200 --> 09:10.800
And I'm faced with a couple options right like make a 30 to 50 minute video

09:10.800 --> 09:14.560
Just talking about the documents relaying like each line basically to

09:14.960 --> 09:18.160
actual events that have occurred in history or talk to ryan wood

09:18.720 --> 09:23.040
Who is kind of as much of an expert as you can possibly get to mj12?

09:23.440 --> 09:29.040
And especially his dad who was a private aerospace contractor who started the majestic documents with mr. Wood and so forth

09:29.040 --> 09:35.920
So I like that a lot. Read the book that tim taylor wrote zack. That's actually a great idea. I'm going to write that down too

09:38.000 --> 09:43.920
Um, and I've heard that as as well. Uh, sorry, I'm just I'm just writing this down from zack real fast

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
I

09:47.680 --> 09:52.320
Okay, that's a that's this is a great question. So the essence of mj12 is

09:52.880 --> 09:56.080
Back in the 80s. I can't remember if it was 82 87 or

09:56.640 --> 10:00.720
What exactly it was but there was a role of documents mailed to some, uh,

10:01.920 --> 10:03.920
ufologists such as

10:04.480 --> 10:06.880
such as stan freedman and these are

10:07.600 --> 10:13.840
The mj12 documents the mj12 purports an organization within the usg established under truman handed to

10:13.920 --> 10:17.920
Eisenhower that basically was formed a little bit before

10:18.640 --> 10:24.080
Ross well because there are references to the interplanetary phenomenon unit, which is actually really interesting

10:24.080 --> 10:26.080
there's actually two references there's a

10:26.480 --> 10:32.160
A case protocol for the ipu in mj12 and there's another kind of like nine page guidelines

10:32.160 --> 10:33.840
I'll actually maybe in

10:33.840 --> 10:39.600
The the discord post that but so there's references to the ipu and of course the ipu the interplanetary phenomenon unit

10:39.600 --> 10:40.880
I know I

10:40.880 --> 10:45.040
Glanced by that my last video. I'm actually probably going to explore that in the different topic like two

10:45.520 --> 10:48.640
Three letter agencies that are kind of unknown in another video coming soon

10:49.280 --> 10:56.320
The ipu was referenced so the mj12 purports the original crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that operated with banna bar bush

10:56.960 --> 10:59.280
Robert j. Oppenheimer even albert einstein

11:00.080 --> 11:02.800
And the thing is these were all labeled hoax by fbi

11:04.240 --> 11:06.560
You know if you look at mj12 documents and you look at this

11:06.640 --> 11:10.640
I think it's the cia root reading room. You'll just see bogus written across the documents

11:11.520 --> 11:14.160
There are hundreds if not thousands of mj12 documents

11:14.640 --> 11:20.800
All talking about protocol like the somo one the special operations manual about what to do when a crash team finds biologics to

11:21.200 --> 11:28.480
A craft to operational protocol to just discussing cases like the isenhower briefing document in 53 that discusses the 1950

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
El indio del Rio case and so forth

11:31.200 --> 11:37.520
So basically the mj12 is the biggest question of are there legitimate documents?

11:37.760 --> 11:43.440
Recorded in the public realm for the crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that dates back to the mid 40s

11:44.240 --> 11:48.240
And that's just the simple answer. There's so much more to get into there's so much intrigue

11:48.560 --> 11:52.640
So many of the classic ufologists stanton freedmen lennard stringfield bill more

11:54.080 --> 11:55.680
Grant cameron

11:55.680 --> 11:58.240
All these guys have talked so much about mj12

11:58.960 --> 12:03.520
So I could keep talking about mj12 forever, but we'll say that probably we'll see

12:04.800 --> 12:08.640
But the the the thing is philippe

12:10.960 --> 12:14.240
If I want to see results in this field

12:14.720 --> 12:16.480
I got to be willing to

12:16.480 --> 12:18.480
kind of do the hard work that

12:19.040 --> 12:21.040
a lot of people don't want to do and

12:21.200 --> 12:26.080
You know to to what ends who knows dangerous, maybe I don't know but

12:26.880 --> 12:29.920
This is subject is just too important to me to kind of

12:30.880 --> 12:38.000
Play the safe road and I appreciate you watched everything. Thank you. It's a ton of great videos coming up, man

12:38.080 --> 12:43.200
A ton. I'm really excited. I can't wait to get back in japan the council boys

12:44.320 --> 12:47.520
Uh, oh, I think I know who it is. Thank you for the euro's brother

12:47.600 --> 12:51.760
Hopefully you're able to go to the manchester card next week

12:52.400 --> 12:55.040
If you are let me know because that actually sounds awesome

12:55.040 --> 12:57.440
And I'm going to be really jealous except you'll have to be up at like 4 a.m

12:58.400 --> 13:05.520
Great job on the recent videos random question. Have you given any thoughts of the alleged Costa Rica sightings in 1971 and the 2007 razor photo?

13:05.840 --> 13:11.120
Yeah, actually the 71 photo if I sorry, let me get a sip of my gate or powerade

13:13.520 --> 13:17.920
If I'm uh, correct here the 1971 photograph was taken from a

13:18.640 --> 13:22.880
geographical coastal mapping plane and it depicts a classic saucer from an elevation of

13:23.840 --> 13:25.840
Between 10 to 25 000 feet

13:26.160 --> 13:29.920
That's a classic picture. I know it's been referenced a lot by people like uh, linda moulton

13:30.000 --> 13:32.240
I think linda moulton howl but and so forth

13:32.640 --> 13:37.520
Or sorry leslie keen. I'm sorry, but that is interesting. So is the razor video

13:37.680 --> 13:41.360
It's really hard to do an analysis on the razor video because there's so few

13:41.920 --> 13:43.920
Frans in which we see the craft

13:44.080 --> 13:46.880
And I know so so if you guys don't know what the razor video is

13:47.120 --> 13:54.080
It's supposedly a costa rica video of a saucer shaped uap taken in 2007 off a flip phone think a motorola razor

13:54.560 --> 13:57.680
This depicts a craft sitting in kind of like a cavern

13:58.160 --> 14:04.480
Resting resting resting quickly the camera shows the craft go belly up like bob lasar describes and fly off

14:04.880 --> 14:08.560
Now the the big kind of drama here is people asking if

14:09.120 --> 14:13.200
A little laxative pain. I didn't even notice that but oh you commented last time and max pain's a great game

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
Especially mass max pain three

14:15.200 --> 14:21.520
But so that the the big controversy around that video is some people surmise that the craft is just something suspended on a string

14:21.520 --> 14:27.520
And that's sort of the the jerking motion. So that requires some analysis, but it's it's tried to um

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
It's it's difficult to to study that

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
Edward lin

14:33.920 --> 14:38.160
I have actually not heard of Edward lin. I'll be completely honest

14:38.240 --> 14:40.240
So if you can tell me who that is

14:40.480 --> 14:42.160
I'd love to know

14:42.160 --> 14:45.760
Big fan of your efforts. Thank you very much. I appreciate that

14:46.560 --> 14:47.440
just

14:47.440 --> 14:50.960
Trying to have everything I do that I can be open source and

14:51.520 --> 14:54.560
You know have the documents for everybody to read themselves and so forth

14:54.560 --> 14:56.880
I think in the future, I'll probably make a website just because

14:57.600 --> 15:01.440
Over time the cases get a lot more complicated and I reference a lot more

15:02.080 --> 15:05.840
So I'd like to have a website with each case log. Maybe a transcript of the video

15:06.560 --> 15:11.280
Maybe some snippets like when I reference a clip like David grush talking on jre because

15:11.760 --> 15:16.080
You know, if I want to hear David grush talk about stargate, I can only have 30 seconds of footage before I might get

15:16.400 --> 15:17.840
My butt hit with copyright

15:17.840 --> 15:23.520
So I'd love to have that stuff on a website where there can be a little bit more context to add it in for people who prefer to

15:24.640 --> 15:26.240
read

15:26.240 --> 15:30.880
What's your opinion on whether or not humans can handle disclosure? This is actually a very good question

15:30.880 --> 15:32.880
I think about this all the time

15:33.040 --> 15:35.040
I oftentimes like to say yes

15:36.240 --> 15:39.760
But you know, what exactly are the uh implications of of

15:40.480 --> 15:45.520
Disclosure there's already so much negative discourse in the uap sphere in general and how people look at this topic

15:46.240 --> 15:50.400
Uh, sometimes I have to step aside because you know, everybody I talk to are

15:50.880 --> 15:55.120
The fine folks who watch my channel and so forth everybody who has an interest in uap

15:55.680 --> 16:00.400
Who likes to study uap who has a pretty good case log in their brains of cases

16:00.480 --> 16:03.680
But you know when I'm at jujitsu and people come up to me with it

16:03.680 --> 16:07.520
Hey, you get you have that ufo youtube channel, right and they start talking it

16:07.920 --> 16:10.320
I think the average person the public just thinks

16:10.960 --> 16:14.800
Even they're still on the the question of are ufo is real, right?

16:15.520 --> 16:16.720
so

16:16.720 --> 16:22.640
When the vast majority of an american populace is just still asking the question if ufos are real

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
I'm not exactly sure how

16:25.680 --> 16:27.680
Well, a populace could handle the

16:28.240 --> 16:31.520
Kind of looming presence of a non-human intelligence on this planet

16:31.600 --> 16:37.920
So it's a multi-layered question like we could probably talk about this for hours and hours, but i'm not sure

16:38.640 --> 16:42.160
Uh, what's going on with the skinwalker ranch having the presentation or something wilder side?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.720
I'm actually going to talk to jesse michael's about this. Um

16:45.680 --> 16:49.360
I have talked to him a little bit about it because he spent some time at skinwalker ranch

16:49.920 --> 16:52.880
I don't think he saw I don't think he said he saw anything weird

16:52.880 --> 16:57.920
But I think he said he experienced like just kind of weird poltergeist phenomena as people call it

16:57.920 --> 17:01.040
So I need to talk a little more about that, but it is

17:02.080 --> 17:08.720
Rather funny with dr. Shawn Kirkpatrick that image from 2018. He looks like a kid who got his hand caught in the candy jar

17:08.720 --> 17:10.720
Does he not he is glaring

17:11.600 --> 17:14.880
Glaring at the camera. I've never seen a man look so furious. So

17:15.680 --> 17:21.840
You guys know my opinion on dr. S. K. I've made videos or made that video a long time about him

17:21.840 --> 17:24.240
And since then there's only more to discuss

17:25.040 --> 17:30.320
And so forth. Why does this subject interest you so much? Have you ever had an experience possibly jason?

17:30.400 --> 17:34.480
I've possibly had an experience just like everybody. I've seen weird lights in the sky things make

17:35.120 --> 17:38.080
Making turns at 90 degree angles zigzagging across the sky

17:38.320 --> 17:41.680
But I cannot say concretely that i've seen a definite form of a craft

17:42.400 --> 17:44.160
I've talked about this a little bit this subject

17:44.160 --> 17:50.000
It has been my primary interest since I was old enough to read one of my first ever books was a book on the betty and barney hill incident

17:50.000 --> 17:53.360
I remember reading that when I was basically in diapers

17:54.720 --> 17:55.680
and

17:55.680 --> 17:56.720
I just

17:56.720 --> 18:00.160
This topic is so weird to me because of the abundance of

18:00.800 --> 18:07.360
information cases documents testimonies to kind of immerse yourself in

18:08.160 --> 18:13.600
But the vile reaction people have back to discount. This is just a common conspiracy. So

18:14.400 --> 18:21.040
I think what really interested me first was just the the idea of contemplating UFOs and then

18:21.600 --> 18:26.160
The amount of evidence for that juxtaposed with the stigma that has been created. So

18:27.680 --> 18:34.880
When I first started my channel, I was mostly interested in just kind of creating a pretty comprehensive database of cases and footage

18:35.440 --> 18:40.960
For people to reference but as I move on I'm more interested in actually doing whatever the heck I can to

18:41.920 --> 18:47.280
Help disclosure, however, I can in any way I can do that, you know, it's tough. I'm not a military guy. I'm not a

18:48.320 --> 18:50.000
politician but

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah, so I figured my route

18:52.000 --> 18:55.680
uh, just like some people before me like Ross could be through journalism and

18:56.240 --> 19:01.920
Just trying to inform the public tell herms. Yes, I do and in just a few minutes. I will drop the link in the

19:03.680 --> 19:05.680
In the chat

19:06.240 --> 19:09.360
Mighty moh, thank you so much. It's okay that you're late to the party

19:09.440 --> 19:12.480
You haven't missed too much. We're just kind of talking through questions just chatting

19:13.120 --> 19:14.080
um

19:14.080 --> 19:15.600
and

19:15.600 --> 19:18.640
I would like do you have any book recommendations for me for my trip to japan?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.000
um

19:20.000 --> 19:25.680
So you can email me at uapgurb at gmail.com. I'm a little bit behind on emails just with how busy I've been

19:25.680 --> 19:27.680
So i'm also going to be doing that on the plane

19:27.920 --> 19:34.320
Again, that's uapgurb at gmail.com or I will post my discord invite here in a couple minutes

19:34.880 --> 19:36.560
fat rodents

19:36.560 --> 19:40.160
Subs we need to keep gerbs gerbs producing

19:40.960 --> 19:42.000
comment

19:42.000 --> 19:48.080
He just said he's a mechanical engineer by day job. Keep him producing. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the support

19:49.440 --> 19:52.000
I'm just wondering I had an nde tell me about that

19:52.000 --> 19:54.480
I you know the the more you immerse yourself in this

19:54.800 --> 19:59.760
Phenomenon kind of the more interesting and the more you move outside the traditional nuts and bolts of fields to study

19:59.760 --> 20:01.760
So I'd like to hear about that

20:01.760 --> 20:06.080
What are your thoughts on grush being so quiet recently? I do not think that he's not that it's

20:06.720 --> 20:08.000
I

20:08.000 --> 20:10.400
I do not think that it's because of laziness or

20:11.520 --> 20:19.600
Not interest. I think that the best avenues for for grush to affect change right now is probably doing stuff behind the scenes

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
This in my opinion has probably worked with

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
congress lawmakers

20:26.720 --> 20:28.400
and so forth I

20:28.400 --> 20:33.520
I think he he did what he needed to do in the public with his ross colt hart news nation interview

20:34.000 --> 20:37.920
His appearance on jesse michael's and his j re appearance. I

20:38.800 --> 20:43.200
I mean in those besides his op-ed, which I still do believe is is on the way

20:43.760 --> 20:44.720
um

20:44.720 --> 20:46.080
He's pretty much

20:46.080 --> 20:52.800
Talked about everything he can publicly, right? So I think the the mostly what he's doing is behind the scenes kona

20:53.440 --> 20:58.880
Please email me at uap grow about gmail.com if you have and I haven't responded. I'm just a little bit behind because

20:59.520 --> 21:01.520
So dang much going on

21:01.520 --> 21:05.680
And thanks before I continue. Thank you guys so much for asking questions and chatting

21:06.160 --> 21:07.520
um

21:07.520 --> 21:12.400
I really appreciate it and I love talking everybody. I'm trying to get through every single one of these because I'm very honored

21:13.840 --> 21:16.240
Pitchforks are coming 30 years and millions of reports later

21:16.240 --> 21:20.960
I hunter believe that they have been here since the dawn of mankind. I don't need anyone to approve what I believe

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
I like that mindset more and more

21:23.920 --> 21:27.920
Grush has talked about this as well and many other people talk about the antiquity

21:28.400 --> 21:32.320
Of the phenomenon, you know, you have the 16th century nuremberg lights

21:32.880 --> 21:36.400
With all sorts of shapes dancing around the skies of nuremberg triangles

21:37.040 --> 21:40.480
weird crescent shaped craft and so forth

21:41.440 --> 21:43.440
all throughout history like the uh

21:43.760 --> 21:47.680
I'm trying to remember like the chariots of juda back in the 11th century in a in a

21:48.960 --> 21:50.960
Middle eastern war

21:50.960 --> 21:55.360
If bob lasar is to be believed one of these craft was found during an archaeological dig

21:56.160 --> 21:57.920
Many people who

21:57.920 --> 22:02.880
Have a good basis of of credibility to stand on talk about this phenomenon being ancient

22:03.600 --> 22:05.600
And I certainly would probably agree

22:06.320 --> 22:07.680
patrick

22:07.680 --> 22:11.280
Have I looked into emory smith? I have not i'm going to write that name down because

22:12.960 --> 22:14.960
Any sort of

22:15.200 --> 22:18.320
Uh investigation I haven't done I would love to do

22:19.040 --> 22:23.120
Everyone comment on this defeat the algorithm. Thank you op tv. I appreciate that too

22:23.200 --> 22:26.960
I I just you know, if I if I need help, I'll reach out to the community. I know

22:27.600 --> 22:31.120
I talked about this in the last video, but I I wish I could get content out faster

22:32.160 --> 22:34.400
It you know, I like

22:35.360 --> 22:37.600
I want the creative process to be mine

22:37.600 --> 22:43.600
So I do everything from thinking of the idea to researching to writing the script to filming to editing to posting

22:43.600 --> 22:46.800
So I appreciate the patience with all this and you know, if I need some

22:47.680 --> 22:51.680
If I if if I need to reach out to people I absolutely will what can the average

22:52.400 --> 23:01.600
Working joe due to legitimize the subject more. That's a great question. I mean, um, what I would say personally is to familiarize yourself with factual data

23:03.520 --> 23:06.560
Understand the usg's history and studying the uap phenomenon

23:07.280 --> 23:13.600
Understand project grudge signed blue book the controversy around osap and atyp uap tf and aro

23:14.320 --> 23:20.160
Talk about the unknown unknowns. All of these programs have registered the obfuscation of data the stigma

23:21.120 --> 23:26.000
And when you bring up this subject at least what I'd like to do in public is not just to

23:26.800 --> 23:30.560
Jump to okay. There's non-human intelligence on this planet

23:31.040 --> 23:34.960
There's reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs, but it's just say wait slow down for a second

23:35.520 --> 23:38.160
People are still arguing about our ufo is real

23:38.720 --> 23:42.720
Well, here's how the u.s. Government has studied ufo since the 1940s

23:43.200 --> 23:47.840
And then you can reference the condom report not the 1969 out of cu boulder condom report

23:47.840 --> 23:52.000
But I somebody told me I said this wrong conding condom

23:52.560 --> 23:58.560
The british mod ufo study that actually referenced the 1989 uh belgian ufo wave of triangles

23:59.360 --> 24:03.520
You can also talk about all the australian ufo reports if you're interested in that

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
I think it's my us over d1

24:05.760 --> 24:09.760
I linked to the internet archive where I referenced a couple australian

24:10.400 --> 24:12.400
uso reports there's a full archive there

24:13.120 --> 24:18.880
And then you can talk about canadian uh lawmakers talking about five eyes nation studying ua uap together. So

24:19.440 --> 24:21.440
I would just talk about

24:22.080 --> 24:23.920
stick to

24:23.920 --> 24:28.000
Introducing people to get comfortable with the fact that ufos aren't just a conspiracy

24:28.560 --> 24:32.720
Because the stigma has been so dang success successful at doing that

24:33.760 --> 24:38.400
Um, yes, sir jujitsu and mixed martial arts. I love jujitsu

24:38.560 --> 24:40.560
Uh, I had training today

24:41.360 --> 24:45.040
I might have got a little bit of a concussion because I was doing technique with a youngster

24:45.120 --> 24:50.480
He was trying to do a fireman's carry threw me over the back shoulder hit the head a little bit. So hopefully it's okay

24:51.920 --> 24:53.920
Thank you. I appreciate that

24:53.920 --> 24:57.600
I think disclosure will cause the ontological shock we've heard about to religious people

24:58.480 --> 25:05.360
But non-religious people it's an easy pill to swallow. Uh, I've actually I've liked how the vatican has handled

25:06.320 --> 25:12.080
Uh discussing this topic in the last couple of years talking about I think they said that god paints with a broad brush

25:12.960 --> 25:18.720
You had a catholic priests at the uh last july congressional hearings with grush

25:19.600 --> 25:20.880
so

25:20.880 --> 25:26.800
I hope I like I hope non-religious people can handle this but at the same time, you know, what are

25:27.280 --> 25:29.280
how's the average person going to

25:29.760 --> 25:33.680
Just react in general when they find out that there is a presence on this planet that

25:34.320 --> 25:41.120
Operates completely different to humans their modus operandi probably still not given out if there's full disclosure why they're here is unknown

25:41.440 --> 25:46.400
How many of them are unknown where they're coming from unknown? Just kind of the fact that they're here. Um

25:47.120 --> 25:49.120
Yes, I do know who mitiokaku is

25:49.680 --> 25:54.640
Uh, I would love to speak to him if you have a way to talk to him. I would really like to talk to him

25:54.640 --> 25:56.880
I have a book of his I can't remember what it's called

25:56.960 --> 26:01.840
But I've always really enjoyed his appearances on j re uh talking about the phenomenon

26:03.280 --> 26:04.720
They've been here

26:04.720 --> 26:08.720
Pitchfork, they've been here forever. Nothing will change. I hope I hope that's not the case

26:10.960 --> 26:16.320
We are at a pretty pivotal pivotal point in disclosure. I think there's been a couple times where

26:17.280 --> 26:19.280
there has been

26:20.640 --> 26:22.640
We've been pretty close to

26:23.040 --> 26:26.160
Sort of disclosure events, but then moved away for various reasons

26:27.840 --> 26:30.160
So I hope things can change now

26:30.320 --> 26:35.920
It partly feels like the genie's a bit out of the bottle with people like grush coming out and so much kind of attention on the

26:35.920 --> 26:38.240
UAP subject. I know it's still a little niche

26:38.960 --> 26:44.960
After all the the excitement died down from the congressional hearings, but let's let's hope with the 2024 ndaa

26:45.680 --> 26:51.840
Um, we can continue that. So how do you rationalize what custodian? I don't know who custodian file

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
Or uh, I don't know who custodian file is

26:55.280 --> 26:57.280
So please tell me if you can

26:58.320 --> 27:00.480
This is a great question on a sliding scale

27:01.200 --> 27:07.840
How confident are you that michael herrera is telling the truth? This is so michael's such an interesting case for me to talk about because like

27:09.520 --> 27:17.200
With the stuff that joey always talks about kind of the extra evidence that michael has of talking to the insider and so forth

27:17.840 --> 27:22.560
It really is one of the most compelling pieces and I can tell you

27:23.280 --> 27:28.800
I had a really weird moment where I actually came across this insider

27:29.920 --> 27:31.920
completely independently

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
In my own research on another project

27:35.840 --> 27:42.160
So that was really kind of weird for me. And no this insider is not anybody i've i've ever covered on the channel

27:42.160 --> 27:47.680
I think somebody commented recently on youtube was uh, the witness i recently spoke to was he michael's insider

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
and no he was not but

27:50.080 --> 27:51.840
I am

27:51.920 --> 27:53.920
Of course, you can't prove

27:53.920 --> 27:55.920
Indonesia although although

27:57.040 --> 27:58.560
although

27:58.560 --> 28:04.000
I am talking or I need to set up a call with somebody who may have some interesting information on

28:04.640 --> 28:10.800
On indonesia back in 2009. So there's an individual. I haven't been able to connect with him yet because i've been so busy, but

28:11.600 --> 28:16.640
I'd like to talk to him. He says he has something interesting to talk to me about the sliding scale on the high side, brother

28:17.120 --> 28:23.600
Love the idea of the website. It would be a lot easier. Yes. Also. What is the best way to help support the efforts?

28:23.600 --> 28:24.880
Of course, like

28:24.880 --> 28:26.640
So I have I have a patreon

28:26.640 --> 28:27.360
I'm not going to continue

28:27.360 --> 28:31.040
I'm not going to advertise it too much until I feel like I have a wealth of content that can keep somebody

28:31.520 --> 28:37.760
Busy for hours hours on end or until I'm able to get like a weekly live stream and so forth where we can discuss cases and so forth

28:37.760 --> 28:42.480
So uh for now if you would watch the videos and share them I that would be

28:43.680 --> 28:45.920
I would love it. I would love it. That would mean everything to me

28:47.440 --> 28:50.080
To people who can't think past that are they going to invade us?

28:50.960 --> 28:53.200
Yeah, I think a lot of that

28:53.920 --> 28:58.640
I always think back to the twilight zone episode to serve man or the invading alien force

29:00.000 --> 29:01.520
eats people

29:01.520 --> 29:03.040
so

29:03.040 --> 29:04.880
Yeah, the the question of invasion

29:04.960 --> 29:10.880
I hope just because that's been so discussed by hollywood with films like independence day mars attack and so forth

29:10.880 --> 29:16.160
I I hope people can start to move past the idea of being invaded by an ny species because

29:16.640 --> 29:18.640
people always like to talk about the moniker if

29:19.600 --> 29:25.520
If they wanted to invade us they already would have so I I I struggle to kind of wrap my head around that but at the same time, you know

29:26.160 --> 29:31.760
Uh non-human intelligence. It's almost impossible to attribute motives to something that doesn't possibly has

29:32.720 --> 29:37.360
No relation to human consciousness or synapses. I don't know. That's a it's an interesting question

29:38.240 --> 29:44.480
In his latest interview that came out the other day sk tried to play the skinwalker ranch presentation down even more you can

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
Yeah, ever since that, um

29:48.560 --> 29:50.560
fugal came up with that photo

29:50.640 --> 29:51.680
so

29:51.680 --> 29:56.480
Remember green street had that basement office episode or not it. Sorry. I'm sorry

29:57.440 --> 30:03.440
He had the interview part two with sk right and that was moved back like a full week or two

30:03.520 --> 30:06.960
I I sincerely think that episode was moved back

30:07.360 --> 30:14.000
Slowly to do damage control on that photo because the entire second interview was just talking about how sk

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Didn't know about that presentation

30:16.320 --> 30:21.040
And he was kind of blindsided by it and he was just asked to be a consultant on it. So yeah

30:23.520 --> 30:29.120
Sk as the kids would say he's kind of a dweeb whether we can handle the disclosure or not is irrelevant

30:29.120 --> 30:34.800
If people believe gravity, it's better to warn them not to jump off a cliff. I yeah, I I am one for

30:35.360 --> 30:41.440
Kind of what guys like rush a that they're still oversight necessary if there are retrieval

30:42.160 --> 30:44.320
and uh reverse engineering programs

30:45.120 --> 30:53.200
I think rush at it. I just rewatched his jre interview. He said that nuclear physics are available to study in an undergraduate course

30:53.680 --> 30:56.960
But the mechanics of making a nuclear weapon are classified

30:57.520 --> 30:58.400
I

30:58.400 --> 31:04.160
Like to think in that ran the same realm of thought around uap still humans and the general public deserve

31:04.240 --> 31:06.240
Disclosure about what is visiting our planet

31:07.120 --> 31:11.520
Possibly where they come from and how they operate. It's their their modus operandi if it's known

31:12.080 --> 31:18.160
But if still technology needs to be kept away because of various potentials of it. I still understand

31:19.760 --> 31:25.040
The public was yeah, um, I grush talked about this as well. Um, kind of

31:26.640 --> 31:30.640
For a forgiveness window for people who may have committed blue collar crime

31:31.360 --> 31:36.000
In program duties, whether that be, you know, hiding away funds racketeering embezzlement

31:36.800 --> 31:38.400
bribery

31:38.400 --> 31:39.680
threats

31:39.680 --> 31:41.840
anything he says when it comes down to the harm and

31:42.480 --> 31:44.800
Possible murders that people need to be locked up an ab

31:45.440 --> 31:47.120
Absolutely, if people have

31:47.120 --> 31:51.360
affected human lives and ended them in for this subject. Yes, they do

31:52.880 --> 31:54.880
Have you heard of

31:54.880 --> 31:57.520
Daniel Salter alien contact intelligence?

31:58.240 --> 32:00.240
No, I haven't I'm gonna write that down

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
Daniel

32:03.760 --> 32:05.840
Salter I'll check that out, man. I've never heard of it

32:06.560 --> 32:11.360
Do you have any posts? I do not yet. I'm still there are a lot of investigations. I'm trying to work on now

32:11.840 --> 32:13.120
in the future

32:13.120 --> 32:18.400
Kind of I'd like to start talking about kind of a ongoing case logs in the in the patreon

32:20.000 --> 32:24.400
So have you ever looked into the connection between ny and psychedelics such as dmt?

32:24.480 --> 32:28.320
No, I have not the only thing I know because I have a memory like a hawk

32:28.880 --> 32:30.000
Um

32:30.000 --> 32:32.880
Is alex jones in 2017 on jre

32:33.600 --> 32:36.240
talking about various government organizations using

32:36.880 --> 32:41.280
Dmt to connect with some sort of non human intelligence in the spirit realm. I have not

32:41.920 --> 32:45.840
I know that I have some family members who have experimented with dmt

32:46.000 --> 32:50.880
And I know some of the stuff they have seen is wild in terms of just uh kind of leaving

32:51.680 --> 32:53.680
Not really existing in the human

32:54.320 --> 32:58.000
Realm of thought anymore. So no, I haven't looked into that but it's very interesting

33:00.720 --> 33:07.200
If they're able to travel to this this planet at will that they probably probably do, um, how you been I have been

33:08.320 --> 33:09.840
Amazing

33:09.840 --> 33:13.040
Thank you very much. If anybody's kind of new to the stream

33:13.440 --> 33:16.640
I'm doing this because tomorrow I am taking a trip out of the country

33:17.120 --> 33:20.160
So I just wanted to chat with everybody because of course I won't be able to get a video out

33:20.240 --> 33:23.120
But I have a lot of projects coming back. I actually might

33:24.640 --> 33:26.640
See what people want to see first

33:28.800 --> 33:30.800
So on the agenda is

33:31.440 --> 33:34.880
I want to do a video on the interplanetary phenomenon unit combined with another

33:35.760 --> 33:38.480
Very shadowy unit that might be a little interesting to cover

33:39.280 --> 33:42.160
I want to do a video on the kalahari incident if I can talk to bill more

33:42.480 --> 33:47.040
Of course, I need to get to kexburg. That's one of the biggest ones the 1941 cape gerudo crash

33:47.520 --> 33:49.520
I want to talk about scalar technologies

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
um, I want to talk about

33:52.960 --> 33:59.040
Ryan wood and the mj-12 and I might also be meeting doing a little trip with uh, mr. Jesse michael's

34:00.080 --> 34:02.080
Maybe we can collaborate on a video

34:02.240 --> 34:04.240
That'd be awesome. I would love to do that

34:05.200 --> 34:08.480
So you've shown evidence where hundreds of millions are allocated to black programs

34:08.480 --> 34:12.720
But that's chump change for something like this. How can you explain the disparity?

34:13.280 --> 34:15.280
yeah, I think that um

34:15.920 --> 34:21.600
I think that I've just pointed out in some videos like a small number of contracts just to start kind of

34:22.720 --> 34:28.080
illustrating a point in terms of especially when contracts are allocated where employees of various companies have said that

34:28.400 --> 34:32.080
These large contracts don't have any kind of movement within them

34:32.640 --> 34:35.920
And so forth. I know that kathryn austin fits in the 1990s

34:36.240 --> 34:41.840
Who talks about the gao failed on it by the pentagon talks about billions upon billions upon billions missing in funds

34:41.840 --> 34:45.040
So I just tackle this at a smaller scale, you know

34:45.120 --> 34:48.800
Even I can't really conceptualize the billions and billions of billions that go into black programs

34:48.800 --> 34:55.440
That are kind of unaccounted for so I just like to analyze from like a small small contract by contract basis and so forth

34:55.840 --> 34:59.200
Uh, how do you make sure that you don't fall down the rabbit hole too much?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.360
And I'm sure you keep grounded but still open to new data

35:01.840 --> 35:06.000
That's actually probably one of the best questions I heard. I I know of of course a couple

35:07.040 --> 35:12.240
YouTubers and so forth who cover this topic who have just kind of like struggled. Um, you know, like

35:12.960 --> 35:16.560
Studying this so much can have adverse mental health effects

35:16.800 --> 35:20.800
I've seen and not just from youtubers but from authors and so forth. So

35:21.600 --> 35:23.600
To stay grounded. I think

35:23.840 --> 35:27.920
One needs to have a life outside of uh studying uap and for me that is

35:28.720 --> 35:33.120
Of course jujitsu, uh, my lovely girlfriend traveling

35:34.000 --> 35:37.840
You know, you can be immersed in a rabbit hole. You want the second you go, uh,

35:38.400 --> 35:42.240
Somebody tries to strangle you be kind of snap out a bit and are able to stay a little bit grounded

35:42.240 --> 35:43.280
but

35:43.280 --> 35:46.800
I think part of the the biggest thing now to kind of get trapped with the kind of

35:47.360 --> 35:50.960
Misinformation and so forth is to really take my time to digest what I'm hearing

35:51.440 --> 35:57.760
And to see how much of new information I can cross reference to existing cases existing documents existing

35:58.400 --> 36:00.400
kind of knowledge out there

36:00.560 --> 36:06.720
The vetting process in this field is so hard. There's so much misinformation so much misinformation that

36:07.520 --> 36:09.520
You know, just got to do the best we can

36:10.560 --> 36:12.080
treading very carefully

36:12.080 --> 36:16.720
It seems plausible that psychedelics remove our filters that keep us from seeing paranormal phenomena

36:17.280 --> 36:20.000
Yeah, so my family members who are actually into psychedelics

36:20.720 --> 36:22.720
have talked about like the

36:23.360 --> 36:25.840
Brain being a tuner for for human consciousness

36:25.840 --> 36:28.480
So I'm trying to remember what they said they talk about how a brain is

36:28.800 --> 36:32.400
essentially a tuner for human consciousness and on the psychedelics that

36:32.640 --> 36:33.760
uh

36:33.760 --> 36:39.520
More information is is taken in by your your filter your brain which it lets you exist in three dimensions

36:39.600 --> 36:43.200
I'm trying to think this this still kind of new territory for me as you guys know

36:43.200 --> 36:45.760
I'm not always try to be really honest about that. Um

36:46.560 --> 36:49.280
Kind of a big nuts and bolts guys so still trying to learn trying to

36:49.840 --> 36:52.880
Kind of understand some of those mysteries of consciousness and so forth a little more

36:53.840 --> 36:58.000
Uh cracker jack. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I will use this to

36:58.720 --> 37:02.640
Train for two days at Kodokan judo in tokyo. So I appreciate that

37:04.080 --> 37:08.800
LC the d.o.t. Can't account for half a test is trillions worth of assets. Yeah, trill. Yeah

37:10.000 --> 37:11.200
Please

37:11.200 --> 37:15.600
Uh, do a video that covers thomas beardan and ning lee. I've heard both of these names before are they

37:16.640 --> 37:21.440
associated with ning lee. I'm trying to remember. Let me know but I I absolutely will

37:22.960 --> 37:27.040
Do you think the story about the good guys versus the bad guys inside the program is a form of diff's information

37:27.040 --> 37:30.480
So people uh thread water loose focus researching dead ends

37:31.840 --> 37:33.440
uh

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
I'm not sure. Uh, I

37:36.800 --> 37:41.440
Logistically within a these programs like this it would make sense of kind of

37:42.160 --> 37:44.880
Interfactionalities and so forth people who advocate for disclosure

37:45.760 --> 37:49.440
And people who kind of want to keep the the the lid on disclosure

37:50.320 --> 37:52.320
um

37:52.320 --> 37:56.880
So that's actually a really good question. I I'm just trying to think of how I can best frame my

37:57.280 --> 37:59.280
answer

38:00.080 --> 38:04.000
Uh, do you good guys versus bad guys a form of disinformation? I

38:05.200 --> 38:10.400
I don't necessarily just due to the amount of first hand people who have come out and

38:10.960 --> 38:16.720
Just said the same thing that there are many elements within programs who will almost stop at nothing to

38:17.520 --> 38:21.840
Prevent any sort of of disclosure from from popping out. I know that answer is not great

38:21.840 --> 38:25.040
But I actually want to think a little bit harder on giving an exact

38:25.520 --> 38:27.760
Reasoning for that question because that's a great question

38:28.720 --> 38:34.160
Grush was busted for at least three years. Yes, this is absolutely true interviewing 40 plus people

38:34.720 --> 38:36.720
Years of research and data acquisition

38:36.880 --> 38:40.080
Um, Colt Hart knows where one is at. Yes, he does

38:41.600 --> 38:46.960
I would love to know where that giant thing is buried. I would love to know but I understand why he can't talk about it

38:48.560 --> 38:50.560
I'm very excited for imminent. I have a

38:51.520 --> 38:56.720
Copy pre-ordered. I'm really excited to to read it really looking forward and anything Dolan puts out

38:57.360 --> 39:01.920
I think we can all agree Dolan's one of the best of the best anything Dolan puts out is is so worth reading

39:02.720 --> 39:08.240
Jeff if we've known that nha exists. We have acquired in reverse engineered off-world technologies for 70 years

39:08.960 --> 39:15.200
Why would we be wasting billions looking for microbes on mars or searching for exoplanets? This is assuming that uh various

39:16.160 --> 39:20.560
agencies like nasa the the the main components are aware of reverse engineering

39:21.040 --> 39:23.040
programs if you go by some of the

39:23.360 --> 39:27.440
The discussions that have been talked about these programs are so sequestered away and compartmentalized

39:28.480 --> 39:32.400
Very very very very few people kind of under understand what's going on

39:32.720 --> 39:35.760
um, and that would kind of be uh, my realm of thought

39:36.400 --> 39:39.600
Is that if technology has been successfully reverse engineered?

39:39.600 --> 39:46.640
It's not like your mission directors at nasa or or funders on congressional staff for nasa are exactly aware of kind of what's going on

39:48.000 --> 39:50.640
I think the uap updates are like waiting

39:52.240 --> 39:54.800
Give me elder sorals elder scroll six, please

39:55.760 --> 39:59.440
Please because starfield uh was not great

40:00.720 --> 40:05.840
Have I seen the infographic show about the strange encounters? Yes or or uh not on

40:05.840 --> 40:11.760
Big foot stuff or squash to be honest. I've never really looked into any like cryptid stuff

40:12.320 --> 40:18.880
My mind has always been on uap. However. I think I've watched uh, of course everybody knows the the youtuber wendig you

40:18.880 --> 40:23.360
And I think I've watched this uh cryptid iceberg a few times and of course that's great, but I've never actually done any

40:23.840 --> 40:26.160
Uh serious research into that

40:26.720 --> 40:31.040
That's not my uh, that's not my realm of of of study

40:31.920 --> 40:37.200
Put a lot of weight work. The weight has always been I appreciate that. Uh, hopefully to to stay on that path everything

40:37.760 --> 40:39.760
that I put out will have research and um

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
Ashing behind it

40:42.480 --> 40:46.000
Yes, actually I will do something on this. I know I'm a bit late the kona blue

40:46.960 --> 40:53.120
Deserves one of those dives where we go in line by line, especially just because it's it's such an interesting, um

40:54.080 --> 40:57.680
Program proposal and how it relates to big low aerospace and so forth

40:58.240 --> 41:00.240
How do I ask question?

41:00.240 --> 41:02.240
Amog you can just um

41:02.560 --> 41:04.560
You can just write it out here and

41:05.360 --> 41:08.400
Yeah, you just did. Yeah, just say anything and I will respond

41:09.040 --> 41:15.200
Conden report us condyne. Thank you. Yeah, I I get flak all the time, but I I can't pronounce most words

41:15.280 --> 41:17.280
it's just because uh

41:17.760 --> 41:19.520
I don't really know how to talk

41:19.520 --> 41:22.240
Ecology, welcome. Welcome very much

41:23.360 --> 41:29.680
Respect your that's a cute guinea pig bgj and ma martial arts. Thank you very much. You're a cool, dude. Um

41:30.960 --> 41:37.680
Back in dc. I'd like to go to dc. Of course, there's so many people out there. I'd like to talk to um

41:38.400 --> 41:40.400
And just meet with so if I ever am I'll let you know

41:41.440 --> 41:44.800
The vatican knows something they have history locked away, which means maybe it's for a good reason

41:45.200 --> 41:48.640
Yeah, if you go by grush speaking about the 1933 magenta case

41:49.280 --> 41:52.960
information upon the crash uap was back channeled to the us by pope

41:54.240 --> 41:56.720
I can't remember but by the sitting pope at the time

41:57.600 --> 41:58.560
um

41:58.560 --> 42:02.240
The best way to de-stigmatize is just to have conversations about what people think on the topic

42:02.400 --> 42:06.720
I often just mentioned how our government is crafting legislation. I think that's a great point. Yes

42:07.200 --> 42:09.840
Talked to the 2023 2024 and ea a

42:10.400 --> 42:15.760
Um just these sort of conversations where you know people immediately want to jump to aliens and craft or ufo's real

42:15.760 --> 42:18.720
Just kind of slowing down and say hey wait. These are the facts so far

42:18.720 --> 42:21.520
I think that's really important land and I think that's a great point

42:22.080 --> 42:26.960
The powers that be are making panic moves. I sure as heck hope

42:27.600 --> 42:32.720
The panic moves if they are doing it aren't too uh jarring because that could lead to some danger

42:33.760 --> 42:37.600
When you see one at under 24 feet, you don't need oh tell tell me about that experience

42:37.760 --> 42:42.880
I'd love to hear that that sounds like an as close of an enclosed encounter as you can get

42:44.160 --> 42:47.200
I've had many people come forward about something they've heard or read about the topic

42:47.200 --> 42:52.800
Yeah, yeah kind of once people understand that you take this topic seriously and once they can understand

42:52.800 --> 42:57.600
They don't really have to be embarrassed most people will will tell you a story they had like I had a guy at

42:58.000 --> 43:01.120
Jiu Jitsu this was a couple weeks ago once he found out about my channel he came up to me

43:01.120 --> 43:04.400
He said you know what I like I was biking in new york back in the early 90s

43:04.400 --> 43:10.480
And a huge triangle flew over my dad and the uh, so it's just really interesting the the stories these people tell

43:12.400 --> 43:17.200
Phone cameras i'm not so sure about that if phone cameras don't seem to be too good at capturing much

43:18.160 --> 43:23.120
The dolce base is real or disinfo that is a really good question. I'm not so I'm not sure

43:23.120 --> 43:26.720
It seems like there's a little bit too much known about uh, dolce

43:27.360 --> 43:33.920
You know there seems to be a bit too much publicly available. I'm trying to remember the uh, the ufo highway ebook by

43:34.800 --> 43:41.120
Crap what's his name? I can't remember but who interviews colonel x who talks about everything in dolce

43:41.520 --> 43:44.480
Maybe dolce is a red herring. Who knows? Uh, it's

43:45.200 --> 43:48.240
It's a tough question. I sir. I don't have enough

43:49.360 --> 43:51.840
Knowledge on dolce to have a really informed

43:52.400 --> 43:53.440
opinion

43:53.440 --> 43:57.040
No, I think birdie asked this too last time with tim taylor. No, it is not

43:58.960 --> 44:01.120
Unless you have the phone. Yeah, that's true. Okay, uh

44:01.920 --> 44:04.240
Road pirate films custodian file is a channel on youtube

44:04.240 --> 44:10.160
He posts videos and records from cameras he had on his roof and he often captures videos objects following planes and helicopters

44:10.320 --> 44:12.720
Oh, I'd like to check that out. That actually sounds really interesting

44:12.880 --> 44:16.480
I'd like to look at that footage. I don't watch uh, too much footage anymore

44:17.040 --> 44:22.720
I know that I've covered uh, two footage cases mostly. I just kind of skate documents and

44:23.120 --> 44:27.920
And so forth a footage isn't my number one focus right now, but I I would like to

44:28.880 --> 44:33.280
To to keep going on that. Sorry. Some sightings are literally five to ten seconds

44:33.760 --> 44:38.960
For leaving. Yeah, love twilight zone twilight zone is great, man. If you've watched the original 50s twilight zone

44:39.600 --> 44:41.600
fantastic Ben

44:42.560 --> 44:44.560
One of the contracts you mentioned

44:44.880 --> 44:48.800
loved one thing I wanted to mention is that a lot of the contracts you mentioned may be

44:49.280 --> 44:53.440
Availability public to research. Yeah, but the internal investors as

44:54.320 --> 44:58.640
SAIC sites took down all those those contracts, but in my video notes

44:58.640 --> 45:01.600
I do have secondary public places where you can read about those

45:02.240 --> 45:06.480
Contracts. Sorry, I should have said that in the video. I'm sorry, but for each contract that has been taken down

45:06.560 --> 45:09.280
I have different links that are still publicly available to look at them

45:09.760 --> 45:14.400
Sighting lasted tell me about your setting to pitchforks. I'd love to hear about it

45:16.400 --> 45:20.880
If they wanted to invade us they would have done it, uh, so this uh, yeah

45:22.720 --> 45:25.360
Not nukes and launching rockets into space

45:26.320 --> 45:28.000
Ethan, what do you say brother?

45:28.000 --> 45:33.360
Too funny was just watching your precious videos in your live great investigation. Really interesting to see more

45:34.080 --> 45:37.600
But I don't know if that's that's fear. I that was I don't know

45:37.680 --> 45:43.040
But the Ross coldheart video with that sphere is really interesting. Yeah, I've watched bits and pieces of this

45:43.120 --> 45:47.920
This was a really great interview. I'm not familiar with the engaging the phenomenon host

45:48.480 --> 45:53.120
But you know, if if anybody is close to him tell him that that was awesome. That was a really great video

45:53.120 --> 45:55.120
It was uh, I think that

45:55.760 --> 46:01.120
Semivans quote that's making the rounds about the phenomenon the truth to it being indigestible is really interesting

46:01.680 --> 46:05.600
There is a new interview with shonkirk patrick from news nation

46:05.600 --> 46:11.760
You know, I thought after the steven green street interview that shonkirk patrick wasn't doing more interviews. So

46:12.560 --> 46:16.000
Why why is he doing another interview torum and

46:16.960 --> 46:18.960
okay

46:19.440 --> 46:24.000
I think sk is a trained intelligence officer if he can't get away with plain dumb and intentionally not looking at things

46:24.000 --> 46:26.560
He will yeah, what's his what's his quote?

46:27.520 --> 46:31.440
Expect me to lie as an intelligence officer. You should expect me to lie to you. I think you said that

46:32.480 --> 46:38.560
Have you investigated cold fusion aka low energy nuclear reaction scalar physics? No, I have not I'm currently

46:39.200 --> 46:43.680
Right now behind the scenes. I'm trying to uh educate myself a little more on the physics

46:43.680 --> 46:47.360
I know that sounds funny coming from an engineer that I don't really understand the physics

46:47.600 --> 46:54.160
But I really haven't spent much time uh researching physics of of of this stuff and I'd really like to so I'm trying to educate myself

46:54.160 --> 46:59.440
Before I speak too much on a topic. I'm not too educated about no one is above the law. I agree

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400
sk was the di

47:02.720 --> 47:05.040
DIA during ossa an atyp. Yes, he was

47:06.080 --> 47:10.080
What's the best way to support my work right now? Just watch the video share it with your friends

47:10.080 --> 47:12.400
Please if you learn something talk to people about it

47:12.880 --> 47:14.880
uh people should be

47:15.280 --> 47:20.240
Uh discussing this subject because it's so interesting and uh, I hope that over time

47:20.800 --> 47:22.800
There's just not as much

47:23.440 --> 47:27.920
We we can we can do our part right now to decrease the stigma around this topic. We really can

47:29.120 --> 47:34.160
I've seen clips like the three frames that was and I've only seen some stuff scrolling through twitter

47:34.240 --> 47:38.800
And and that was uh, that was really interesting. I don't know. I haven't dug into that very much

47:40.400 --> 47:42.400
These seven years have started up

47:43.040 --> 47:48.320
Any time these last seven years more. Yes more. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. There's kind of been uh

47:48.960 --> 47:50.960
This is a period of time where there has been

47:51.200 --> 47:52.560
almost uh

47:52.560 --> 47:54.800
Irreversible movement in the realm of uap

47:57.280 --> 48:02.560
That is the uh, so infiltration by hybrids that is the original work of david

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
Ike right who talks about

48:05.200 --> 48:10.880
I think it was him who who originally thought of uh, reptilians and so forth. I I've never

48:11.600 --> 48:13.600
Really kind of dug into that topic

48:14.400 --> 48:18.160
Uh, what is my favorite ufo k slash whistleblower?

48:18.640 --> 48:20.640
whistleblower

48:21.760 --> 48:23.760
Um ufo case

48:27.440 --> 48:36.240
That's a good question. Uh, uh, let's think my favorite case. Of course, this would be a crash retrieval. Uh, I just think

48:36.960 --> 48:38.960
Hmm

48:38.960 --> 48:43.040
I'm not going to do a cop out by saying roswell because that's everybody's favorite taste

48:44.400 --> 48:46.400
Hmm

48:46.720 --> 48:48.160
I

48:48.160 --> 48:49.760
really like

48:49.760 --> 48:53.920
Just researching and reading about the 1974 cayome mexico case

48:54.720 --> 49:00.080
I really like shag harbor. I really really like kexburg. Um

49:03.200 --> 49:05.200
Right now let's

49:05.840 --> 49:08.640
Favorite case right now at this moment. Let's say kexburg

49:09.360 --> 49:10.960
whistleblower

49:10.960 --> 49:16.320
Of course, I think in everybody's heart. I've talked about this before I try not to talk about them too much because I'm sort of

49:16.320 --> 49:19.840
Blinded by bias because I want to believe him everybody's favorites bob lasar

49:20.640 --> 49:24.240
But again, I I don't cover him or ever reference him in terms of like, okay

49:24.240 --> 49:30.240
Like this case might be valid because remember bob lasar said this but because I want to believe him so badly growing up

49:31.520 --> 49:36.240
What bob said just captured my mind so much but favorite whistleblower

49:37.600 --> 49:39.120
of course

49:39.120 --> 49:41.120
Probably one that I've covered

49:41.280 --> 49:46.800
Who there was some a little bit of controversy around that's not technically a whistleblower that did not want

49:47.360 --> 49:50.720
That said that his story was not true from where I found it

49:52.080 --> 49:52.960
A little bit

49:52.960 --> 49:58.000
I find daniel solter is a documentary called the UFO the greatest story ever denied and it's only short segments

49:58.000 --> 50:01.680
I emailed let me check it if you email it to me and I missed it. I'm sorry about that

50:01.760 --> 50:04.240
I'm pretty behind on email. So I will get to that

50:05.200 --> 50:08.640
Much love from norway keep up the good work. Hey, thanks, man. I was just in norway last september

50:08.640 --> 50:11.040
I went to jevick and oslo. I love norway

50:12.240 --> 50:15.280
mj-12 is interesting ryanwood has yes, yes, right?

50:15.280 --> 50:20.480
This is why ryanwood is the person i'm going to meet with on this because ryanwood is the best person

50:20.480 --> 50:22.480
I know about mj-12

50:22.720 --> 50:27.760
In my recent video when I talked about the non terrestrial science and technology the committee on that I

50:28.480 --> 50:30.480
immediately reached out to ryanwood

50:30.960 --> 50:35.680
And i'm going to be discussing with that with him more when I get back from japan i'm going to be meeting with him

50:35.680 --> 50:37.680
So i'm really looking forward to that

50:38.640 --> 50:43.360
What are the thoughts that we talked about this a little bit before and make sure you 70 I think I'll probably stay clear of that

50:43.920 --> 50:48.960
For now just because of the the drama and stuff around that one thing I hope I hope you guys know for me

50:48.960 --> 50:51.360
It's I really don't want to get interested in like

50:52.640 --> 50:54.880
Like social media drama. I don't like that

50:56.240 --> 51:00.320
There's no grounded. There's thousands of ny hi stories around the world if just one is true. Yes, there are

51:01.120 --> 51:03.120
thousands um

51:03.280 --> 51:05.680
Back a while ago some guys at jujitsu brought up that heat map

51:06.240 --> 51:11.360
Of ufo sightings and pointed to the fact that the us was the most populated region even though it was a us study that

51:11.600 --> 51:13.200
generated this heat map of

51:13.200 --> 51:19.760
The coagulated ufo sightings and so forth and all you have to do is look at the hundreds of if not thousands of stories from

51:19.920 --> 51:24.080
All around the world. There are so many rich stories. I'm hoping when i'm in japan

51:24.640 --> 51:27.600
I can talk to some kind of local people of I can't speak japanese

51:27.600 --> 51:31.040
But if some people speak good english ask them about local ufo stories

51:33.440 --> 51:37.120
Pentagon still hasn't really passed an audit by the previous gao standards. I researched that a while back

51:38.160 --> 51:40.160
Anything else?

51:41.040 --> 51:44.080
Yeah, this is a great a great point

51:44.080 --> 51:48.800
I'd probably recommend to anybody just some take some breaks have some hobbies outside of uap

51:50.160 --> 51:53.040
Watch some good movies watch some science fiction watch some interstellar

51:53.600 --> 51:55.200
Watch the expanse

51:55.200 --> 51:58.880
Just be able to chill out for a little bit. I know that's important for me at least

51:59.840 --> 52:06.960
What would some people are talking about saps disclosing we have people all throughout space literally a breakaway society?

52:07.280 --> 52:09.280
Yeah, that's a that's a really interesting

52:10.320 --> 52:16.320
Concept the the idea of the the kind of breakaway society as people reference to the reverse engineering programs

52:17.360 --> 52:19.360
That's a lot too

52:19.840 --> 52:21.200
Lot to explore sorry

52:21.200 --> 52:24.240
I got caught up with this profile picture not the name my family

52:24.720 --> 52:29.920
Does support me my mom's the best she always watches my videos and wants to talk about the cases so she's great

52:32.320 --> 52:34.480
Come up to kexburg, you know what?

52:35.520 --> 52:40.480
I actually would like to when I cover kexburg. That's actually a good idea. I would like to try and get boots on the ground

52:40.960 --> 52:47.040
Uh, that actually I'd like to do that more. That'd be uh, great. I'd like to do that a lot. Zach. What's up, brother?

52:47.840 --> 52:52.080
Any videos you think could be legit ufo's england from 98? I'm trying to think about that

52:52.240 --> 52:54.800
So I use this a lot in my b-roll footage

52:55.440 --> 52:58.400
One of my favorite sightings there's two sighting here

52:58.880 --> 53:01.360
It's not the green triangle from tom DeLonge

53:01.840 --> 53:07.040
But it's that individual's triangle sighting of the three-pointed triangle with the the red circle in the middle

53:07.440 --> 53:11.680
That takes off at very fast speeds. I haven't done a full analysis on that but I

53:12.720 --> 53:19.360
Really really really love that footage. I'm still I'm still kind of uh back and forth on both fly by and

53:19.680 --> 53:25.680
The metapod I think the metapod might have a little more credence, but those still I'm still kind of trying to uh

53:26.560 --> 53:28.560
Trying to think through a little bit. All right

53:30.720 --> 53:34.960
Salvador paiz looks familiar and I may have worked with him in the power and propulsion division at navair packs river

53:35.040 --> 53:36.320
Holy cow

53:36.320 --> 53:42.160
If you were working at packs river in the propulsion and power division you very well may have that is really interesting

53:42.720 --> 53:46.880
Uh, if you remember anything about him, let's talk. I'd love to hear about uh paiz

53:47.840 --> 53:50.400
Let's all head out to skinwalker ranch and eat a bunch of mushrooms

53:51.280 --> 53:54.880
That all sounds fun and dandy until the filming crew kicks us off the land

53:56.160 --> 53:59.840
Ryan thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. We will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure

54:00.400 --> 54:06.080
Caught a yes. I hope so that that is going to be one of my uh greatest missions to try and do

54:06.880 --> 54:11.200
Are there any associations between weather and UFO sightings? I actually I actually if I'll be honest

54:11.200 --> 54:18.320
I have no idea. I really don't um, that's a that's a good question to ask if there's any variable weather padding patterns and mass sightings and so forth

54:18.320 --> 54:20.320
I I do not know

54:21.200 --> 54:25.200
Uh, what are your thoughts on the coast to coast am interview with victor alleged?

54:25.920 --> 54:31.200
as foreworker who smuggled footage out of the alien interview tape, uh, I know that there's a lot of

54:31.760 --> 54:34.640
Discussion around that. I think it's that's uh, john stewart

54:35.840 --> 54:39.120
That's uh, john's the case. John stewart is working on is it not um

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
I

54:42.400 --> 54:46.000
There was a weird connection between that and calahari I read today

54:47.200 --> 54:50.640
In terms of in like file notes for referencing calahari

54:51.680 --> 54:56.400
I am not quite sure. I haven't spent too much time. I know there's a lot of controversy around the video

54:56.800 --> 55:01.360
But somebody recently was like doing an analysis where they inverted colors to track like pupil

55:02.160 --> 55:07.440
Tracking on the supposed bean. It's it is that is uh, that's really interesting

55:07.760 --> 55:11.120
So I would I will do a little bit more studying and kind of get back

55:11.920 --> 55:17.040
Crade thank you. Thank you, man. I appreciate that and I'm sorry my answer to your question about

55:17.920 --> 55:21.680
Why I do not think that good guys first bad guys is misinformation

55:22.080 --> 55:25.600
I'm actually gonna I'll do a community post about that in the future because that's such a good question

55:26.400 --> 55:34.320
Golden is dolin is the gold standard. I completely agree. Uh, dolin and colt heart and lenard lenard string field are my inspirations

55:34.320 --> 55:40.560
Especially lenard string field that man's a legend. If you haven't read crash retrieval, uh one through seven

55:40.640 --> 55:44.480
I highly recommend it. Leonard string field is an amazing individual

55:46.000 --> 55:49.920
Why do you think he hasn't spoken recently? I do think what grush is doing is work behind the scenes

55:49.920 --> 55:55.440
I'm not sure how much he can contribute to to a public discourse right now unless there's more senate hearings

55:56.080 --> 55:58.480
I'm not sure what else he can say publicly

55:59.200 --> 56:03.120
Uh to pass dopser that hasn't already been said, but of course. I don't know grush

56:03.920 --> 56:08.480
Uh, but I would like to know what do you mean pitchfork? Everything you said is a lie

56:09.040 --> 56:11.040
john s

56:11.120 --> 56:16.080
My man, thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. I agree with starfield. Yeah, I played a little bit of it and it kind of

56:16.560 --> 56:21.280
Stunk 2017 prey. No, I really want to play that. Uh, if any of you guys here play games

56:21.680 --> 56:26.640
Let me hear what you play. I love I love me some games. Um, so I would like to play

56:27.360 --> 56:28.640
Starfield

56:28.640 --> 56:30.640
I'm sorry. Sorry. I mean prey

56:30.800 --> 56:32.240
I heard recently

56:32.240 --> 56:36.320
Pine gap is a pretty decent location if you go to greer's dpi archive

56:36.800 --> 56:40.080
And search and look at pine pine gap documents

56:40.560 --> 56:44.320
I think he has two witnesses talk about pine gap and a facility there

56:44.800 --> 56:48.720
I've also heard from some other individuals that pine gap might be the location there

56:48.720 --> 56:51.360
There was some interesting stuff around a korea location

56:51.760 --> 56:56.080
But I also talked to a guy who was pretty familiar with kind of fai and fight transponders and stuff

56:56.080 --> 56:58.080
And he kind of talked about the purpose of that facility and

56:59.120 --> 57:02.480
He said that uh, that korea location may not exactly be it

57:04.880 --> 57:09.600
Looking cut. I appreciate that man. It's just the lighting. I'm a bit of a I'm a bit of a jelly roll right now

57:09.600 --> 57:11.600
I do that so I can smash people in jujitsu

57:12.560 --> 57:16.240
Path of exile a couple of my buddies play that they say it's great. I might have to

57:17.280 --> 57:20.480
Speaking on behalf. Thank you for watching. I really appreciate that guys

57:21.360 --> 57:24.000
This is all governments do is lie and then shame me for questioning them

57:25.360 --> 57:31.600
You go. Yeah, I mean, uh, in many respects governments don't really have the the public's best interest in mind

57:32.720 --> 57:34.880
I'm still waiting on some quality alien video

57:35.760 --> 57:40.480
They are here looks cool to have atmosphere, but it'd be awesome to see something ground based on the current knowledge and culture

57:41.040 --> 57:43.600
Yeah, I'd love I'd also love, um

57:44.560 --> 57:46.560
if we could ever get access to the, um

57:47.600 --> 57:50.720
satellite images that both grush and melin have discussed

57:51.760 --> 57:53.760
Uh high quality satellite images showing uap

57:55.440 --> 57:58.400
You're great to be an interview with a grush and alizano. That would be

57:59.040 --> 58:03.600
Absolutely, that'd be a classic that'd be an absolute classic. I'd love to see alizano talk more

58:04.160 --> 58:08.640
Huge fan of his interviews with kerch. I'm mongolo on the theory of everything. Those are absolutely fantastic

58:08.640 --> 58:14.640
If you haven't watched those I highly recommended and if you haven't watched, uh, David grush's jre appearance

58:14.640 --> 58:17.280
I highly recommend that too. I watched it, uh

58:19.040 --> 58:21.040
Thursday for like the fifth time

58:21.520 --> 58:24.800
I actually have some problems with joe on that interview if i'm being honest

58:25.200 --> 58:29.760
Joe really kind of worships the ground guys like bob lasar and travis walton walk on right

58:30.160 --> 58:32.240
He always talks about bob lasar and his credentials

58:32.640 --> 58:38.400
But he kind of was acting a little bit negative towards grush, which was really interesting to me. Um

58:39.600 --> 58:40.640
You know

58:40.640 --> 58:43.360
I I just I didn't really like how joe handled that interview

58:44.240 --> 58:46.240
I just might brother. Thank you

58:46.960 --> 58:48.960
Toby I appreciate that. Um

58:49.760 --> 58:51.760
I would like to

58:52.320 --> 58:54.720
Uh, I would like to try and stream like once a week

58:55.680 --> 59:00.240
That would actually be really fun. I'd like to do that. Are there links between her era and r.a. No, there are not

59:02.000 --> 59:05.440
If you talk about danger like the u.s. Military is I mean the

59:06.560 --> 59:08.560
I hope not man. I'm not

59:10.080 --> 59:13.600
Like the u.s. Military. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a point

59:14.560 --> 59:21.040
U.p. Show up in ir. That's why regular cameras don't capture them. Yeah, I've heard this too. I I can't remember. What's that gentleman who?

59:21.760 --> 59:23.760
showed up at the um

59:24.880 --> 59:27.760
He showed up at the sci conference

59:28.400 --> 59:31.840
I can't remember but he's starting like a startup to track uap with various systems

59:31.840 --> 59:35.360
I I can't remember this young man's name, but he's seen his work seems really

59:36.240 --> 59:41.760
Promising toby. I talked about that a little bit earlier. I talked about uh the interesting aspects about

59:42.640 --> 59:50.080
The the insider and that this case is difficult or I don't won't talk about it too publicly too much anymore just because I like

59:50.880 --> 59:55.280
It's difficult to talk about this case without referencing kind of like the the evidence and so forth

59:55.280 --> 59:57.280
Joey has talked about about this insider and so forth

59:57.280 --> 01:00:04.400
But as I mentioned earlier, I was able to also kind of analyze this insider or find out about this individual in a roundabout way

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.720
I've seen two ufo one in texas one in houston. Tell me about him and I'd love to hear with it

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:19.120
I agree with watching much footage, but user five posted and read it in youtube some extremely compelling videos using the thermal camera

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.520
I'll check that out. I I would I of course love watching footage. I just don't um

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.320
I don't I just don't uh like

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:32.000
Focus too much on it, but yeah, I'll absolutely watch hackology. I'm an active mod of many subs due to my interest

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I would love to send you my sightings. Yes, please

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.440
um

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.040
uap girl about gmail.com. I'll be spending a lot of time kind of looking at

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.160
Uh, kind of catching up with emails on my flight to japan

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.160
Are there con?

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.560
Are the contracts classified from government sites? I do not know the government sites would probably won't hear about the contracts

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.680
Jimmy, thank you very much. I really appreciate that and that's a really cool sushi shu. I um, thank you so much really

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.880
They're here and they take whatever animal person that they

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.600
have invaded long ago, so

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:12.160
I think it was colm kelleher that stated I'd like to know what you think about this. I think it was colm kelleher that touched on the

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.960
cattle mutilation and said that he his personal hypothesis was that

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.000
There was some sort of agency detecting detecting like

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.120
preons and local prions preons. I don't know. Okay. I'm sorry. I can speak in local cow population

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.480
What do you think about that?

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:33.600
You've seen the ner off website. Yes, I don't maybe not the a new version. I don't know. I could have checked that out, man

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.480
um

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.880
There's a government site of all

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.920
If there is a government site, I actually haven't found it. I usually find contracts on private company

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.520
Their various investor websites, so if there is I actually need to find that

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.640
We I ever make a video on the disclosure act 2.0. I probably will not and here's why

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:00.560
Actually, I haven't covered the original disclosure act. There's only minor differences in the disclosure act 2.0 the same

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520
numerous references to

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.880
non-human intelligence legacy programs crash materials the 1954 atomic energy agreement classifying uap material as clans

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600
Trans classified for a nuclear material

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.120
And that is how much of this has not been disclosed because anything that's new nuclear secrets doesn't really need to be disclosed

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.720
So maybe I will just because I haven't even talked about the first act in general

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.440
And at the point where see their breakaway civilization that are group keeping the locked away for good reason

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.200
um

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.800
yeah

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.800
I understand the um

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.160
I don't I struggle with the good reason. I think back to the

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.120
original news nation interview with ross colthardt

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:46.160
And grush said one of the reasons for this being kept secret was feudalistic dominance. Uh, I can't think of a good reason behind that

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.600
What are your thoughts on ai?

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.920
Being a part of the phenomenon. Um, I'm thinking back to section five behavioral analysis from the flyby footage from that

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.680
a

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.560
leak that occurred on I think it was 4chan that I

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:09.360
Still don't have really a place for um that talked about basically some craft being sort of an advanced model of of uh ai

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.920
I don't know. Um

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.680
Grush had some interesting things to talk about ai on jre too

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:24.240
and and especially his worries of of using ai offensively in in uh adversarial systems basically dropping the ai

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.160
expecting it to perform but then kind of not really having uh,

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.120
Not really having hackology. I just got your email. Thank you

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.880
But not really having a way to kind of control the ai. So ai is rather frightening

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.080
Uh, how it relates to the phenomenon. I'm not quite sure but I uh, I don't know

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.800
Have it dig into silicon-based life like is suggested. Yes, there is a great youtube

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.480
I watched a really good youtube documentary on silicon-based life

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.480
And there is a really good like a graphics-esque, uh youtube channel. I I can't remember

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:04.080
Heck, what is the name? I'll find it. No, I'll plug it. But yes, I have silicon-based life is extremely interesting

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.800
Um

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.120
So what are your thoughts on the lani's amora case?

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.680
Yes, I would love to cover more of the classic cases. Uh, currently

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.080
I'm looking at interesting parallels between the lani's amora case craft and the calahari desert south africa in 1989

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080
alleged crash retrieval

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.160
if you look through some of the uh,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:30.480
Military documents alleged military documents that were recreated discussing the 1989 craft the crash had similar

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.040
Symbology from the lani's amora case

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.400
So I do want to cover that because now I'm I'm really interested in kind of that symbology and so forth and trying to understand that

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240
Abductions, what do I think about uh,

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.480
Stephen Greer to evil humans being michael akino the leader of this set temple

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.000
Greer is a bit of an enigma to me if I'm being honest

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.120
I'm not quite sure about so many of his motives and it's weird because so much of his research is brilliant

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.160
And then so much of what greer has done post

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.600
You know a certain date wherever we can find he started to do some some interesting stuff

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.240
Abduction cases are really interesting. I kind of mentioned earlier one of my first ever cases. I read about was betty and barney hill

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.760
um

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.040
So and of course, I know travis walton many of the famous cases

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.280
They're really interesting. I don't know what to make of them to be honest. Um

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.880
I what interests me is the intent behind

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.960
abduction, so I would want to uh, I would really kind of want to backtrack and

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.760
Try to find context around the abduction and try to determine motives as to why this happens

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.040
But abductions are really interesting and they're extremely frightening

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.320
To think of if you guys have seen fire in the sky, I know it's a dramatization about travis walton's case

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:51.520
The scene where travis walton is uh, basically experimented on fire in the sky came out in 93 is terrifying

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.520
I believe bob, let me know what you guys think about, uh, lasar, of course lasar is such an interesting case

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.680
Hopefully we can get to the bottom of his case

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.920
Again, like what I said is he's tough for me to talk about because I am just so biased in towards bob

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.880
I want to believe him so bad. So it's hard for me to take an objective lens because you know

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.840
I'll see problems with bob sesame. I'll say yeah, well, maybe this because I I want to believe him so darn bad

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.400
Toby, thank you very much. Uh, I I'm trying to get through everything. I'm sorry if I'm slow guys. I know I can ramble

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.000
Do you think consciousness is tied to the you I've heard that maybe these vehicles could be controlled with consciousness

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.160
And so can you elaborate on how you view consciousness?

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.440
A while ago if you asked me I probably would have said no, but over time more and more cases I follow

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.720
There's more and more kind of link between human cognition human consciousness and

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.880
UAP some of the claims that vehicles can be controlled with consciousness

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.160
Of course, you have Michael talking about p Michael Herrera talking about p3's but also backtracking a little bit

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.200
You have uh, ross colt heart talking about kind of consciousness interface with controlling craft

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.160
You also have the infographics whistleblower fees to be real

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.560
That retrieval teams need to have basically grounding mechanisms. So their brain isn't distorted by the phenomenon

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.680
You have Gary Nolan. You have Jacques Valet. You have

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.040
Lou Elizondo who's discussed this and you have many more who have talked about issues with cognition and

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.040
various problems that occur with the human mind encountering UAP

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.200
um

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.040
So at this point, I do think there is a link between consciousness and cognition and UAP what it is

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.920
I don't know. I really don't know and I'd love to find out because remember i'm coming from a realm

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:34.960
A science realm where you think of of synapses and stuff in in the driving cause between the human brain

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:39.440
But more and more I studied this phenomenon the more and more there's a strange link between these

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.960
Hey, griff, when's the next iceberg episode? Would you guys like another iceberg episode? I don't want to like

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.520
The thing is I don't want anybody to be disappointed when I put out a release

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.160
um

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.560
I would love to make more iceberg because it's kind of fun to put a little bit more human a little bit more

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.960
Or a humor a little bit more of a personal spin on stuff

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.200
But if you guys don't like the icebergs, I won't do it. But if you guys want to see some icebergs, I'll do it

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.720
I also

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.200
Maybe I'll wait till 10k. I'm going to do the taxonomy from carl nels deleted slide

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.800
Just talking about every single possible origin of nhi

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.120
so

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:20.240
Uh apek arts parts and analysis and their thruster experiments. I have not ch, but that sounds really good. I'm gonna write that down

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.040
Thank you guys if whenever people

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.320
Put stuff out like this for me to look at I really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.720
Uh

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.160
If you had to estimate the amount of people who have been part of a crash retrieval reverse engineering team

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.760
What do you think the number is?

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.800
This is total guess, but I'd say relatively

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.040
small like

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.040
In history maybe below 500

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:52.400
In my guess you ate your crash retrieval teams the personnel on them are probably highly highly highly specialized

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760
and if you look at

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.640
Remember recently I mentioned that uh christopher sharp article about the oga and jsoc

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.480
Joint special forces operations command if some of these crash retrieval operators are jsoc

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.680
They are highly trained and those don't come a dime a dozen

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.600
Ecology mj-12 fifth annual review uh written

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.200
I need to look at the if was that written by ryanwood

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
I gotta look at that

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.040
Rattle rattle. Thank you so much. We need to support you. Thank you. I appreciate that very much

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.760
Um, sorry, let me I'm a young richard dolin. I thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Um

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.320
I he's a true inspiration hunting victor the documentary tell me i'ma write that down

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.960
I will download that and watch that on the plane

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.960
I

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.240
Play minecraft minecraft is great bro. Everybody loves minecraft

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.560
Wow, I would love to play wow, although I think I would lose my holy cow. Are we just getting to the the games?

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.200
I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. Uh

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.960
I'm sorry. Uh, I'm taking so slow a lot of people have called greer grifter neglecting the important work. Yes

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.040
I agree. This is why I talk

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.200
In almost every video about the 2001 disclosure briefing document

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.920
I think that piece of literature is brilliant and a must read if you haven't I highly highly highly recommend it

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920
It's fantastic

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.760
Have you ever read inside flying objects by michael p masters? No, I haven't but michael p masters is really interesting

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.800
I'd like to uh, I'd like to get into a bit more of his work

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.280
You are a beast

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.320
bjj and i give you those guns. No, I just lift a lot of weight. Thank you

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.360
What are your thoughts on steven greer? It seems like uh

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.040
Ever hey, do you want so I've talked about greer a lot

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.120
Uh, I have mixed feelings on greer because I don't like how he charges thousands of dollars for ce5

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.040
And I don't like how he self-aggrandizes himself in his witness stories

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.680
A good example of this is michael herera's case when michael herera discusses

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.640
That he was held at gunpoint by these men

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.200
the black operators

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:11.920
When he observed the ufo greer likes to take it a step further by saying that he was made to turn around and get on his knees

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.720
Uh, basically thinking he's gonna get shot in the back of the head

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.480
So greer likes to kind of control these witnesses a little bit

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.840
It seems and kind of aggrandize the stories when it makes a little sense to make them seem a little bit more sensational

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.080
Sensational however at the same time

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.560
Stephen greer has done exceptional work for ufology exceptional work

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:37.680
2001 disclosure briefing document is a fantastic piece. I so recommend reading that the greer witness list

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:44.080
I talk about this every time I reference the subject these people need to be separated from greer himself

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.760
Okay, just because they're contacting greer their case a lot of people say oh like he's in contact with greer

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.800
We shouldn't look at his case. No these individuals deserve to be analyzed just as much as anybody else

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:02.720
Some of the work greer has done is excellent. There's a top line summary in the disclosure briefing document that talks about the program back in 2001

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.800
I I find it and I'll post it, but it's fantastic. I'll actually do a community post on it. Um

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.520
What are your thoughts on ai as an aspect we talked about that a little bit have I watched professor simon holland's

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.520
I've heard of professor simon holland, but not orford ness. I will actually get into that a little more

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.920
um

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.160
Once a spook always a spook and I remove that comment with the word line. Yeah, once a spook always a spook

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.680
Hey, man, really enjoy your detail oriented videos remind me of think anomalous who covers some of these cases when he sometimes includes details

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.360
Other researchers overlook. Thank you very much. I really appreciate those kind words

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.160
He's in project gravitar with little zars input coming out this year s4 recreated in vr in crazy detail. Yeah

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.520
um, I know on the project gravitar website or kind of some of their promotional material

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.760
They have screenshots from the craft and that's really interesting. Also mac mayve studios has a great video inside

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.480
Inside area 51 and s4. I've used some b-roll footage for that

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.360
I'd really like to collaborate with that dude because he makes some awesome stuff. But yeah, check that out. That's great

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.760
Greetings from chile. What's up, brother? Thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.880
Trying to give you money. It's okay, man. Well, thank you for having me on patreon. But I

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.400
Thank you so much day after raswell is core. So yeah, I'm sorry. I was looking at that. I think the raswell incident

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400
That's bill more come to think of it

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.760
Game recommendations. You can never go wrong with doom 2016

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.560
Doom plus doom eternal. Yeah, the doom games are fantastic to zealot. I hope you're still here

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.080
God of war ragnarok is fantastic as well. I can't wait for that new doom game

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.720
Games games. I'm trying to think is no games have really caught my attention too much lately

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.080
I'm gonna replay ghosts of sushi ma if you haven't played that that's an excellent game. I can't wait

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.960
UAP humanoid encounters coming out of peru. No, but I know that ross coldheart just did a video on that

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.120
Those are pretty interesting. They talk about beings that like melt people's faces off

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.920
Of course, I can't discount anything. I just haven't done enough research to have a very informed opinion

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.920
It's very interesting though. And I'd like to listen to that reality check episode that talks about this

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:09.440
Um, what are your thoughts on the nascar mummies? I post this website last time because I talked about it on a recent video

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.160
You should check out the 3d scans of all the mummies

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.520
You can kind of go through the the different layering of them. It's super interesting

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.200
And guys in about 15 minutes. I'll have to hop off. So I'm going to get through everything because I got a pack

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.200
I haven't I haven't packed um

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.920
Huckology. Yes, I have and I will post that as well. What do you think about pyramids in Alaska?

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.400
It's one of the price locations remote view prior to his death

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.120
uh, the remote viewing is

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:39.520
Yeah, Alaska is a very mysterious land. I've heard of a possible reverse engineering locations in Alaska as well

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.920
I think Alaska is a very mysterious land. I

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.480
Don't know. I don't know maybe remnants of an ancient civilization in Alaska. I don't know

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.080
I do not know but that's a good question fat rodents. Thank you so much watching this with buddies

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.520
We'll tell your slimes as the kids say I say hi getting money. Thanks. Hopefully. Thank you very much. I appreciate that

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.440
Got a jet

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.920
Well, you probably signed off but have a great night, bro

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.080
I'm sure that you've seen yes, I have seen the beaver utah footage

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.000
It's pretty interesting, but I haven't given it a full analysis like I I don't want to just say like

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.280
I think this or this without uh, really thoroughly looking at something. Um, but you know, I will take a take a harder look

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:26.400
Listen, you know, actually that would be kind of fun if any of you guys want to kind of get together and play some games together

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.720
I'd love to do that. Colm said there seemed like there were two groups. One had the laser tech trying to go through

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.480
Uh, imitate mutilations. I had not heard that. Thank you for clearing that up

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:41.280
I've got to look into that as well. Say get employee. What is your day job? I am an engineer. I do mostly qa

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.480
Engineering these days and it's very boring

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.640
If you see any clear ufo company, yes, uh, jennanette is fantastic

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.160
Someone sent me one of his videos, uh, recently and they're really great. I would highly recommend

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.800
But have you blocked s but he's on mj 12. It's really good

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.600
No, I have not

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.920
No, I will read that. Thank you

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.840
Finally caught alive is the ufo news dying out. No, I do not the mall incident. No, I do not think so

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.160
I think with the 2024 I think after congress recesses in august as this issue is voted on

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.680
We'll see a lot more interesting things and I think with lulis ando's book coming out

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.080
We'll see a lot of interesting things

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:27.680
Ethan Simmons. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Enjoy japan. I'll see what other data. Thank you very much

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.840
I will use this money to feed myself some delicious sushi. Thank you so much

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.600
Uh, let me I'm trying to go fast guys. I'm sorry. I'm so slow. No sweat

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.280
Why would these uap let themselves be seen?

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.480
I don't know attributing motives to the phenomenon if you've read jock valet's book dimensions and passport to magnolia

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040
it seems like sometimes the uh

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.040
It seems like sometimes the uap either want themselves to be seen once it disguised themselves as other things or so forth

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.560
Attributing motives and understanding. I really don't have any idea. I really don't I'd like to understand more

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.120
What about the young guy's tracking, uh, ronnie vernet? No, he was just with reality check yet

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.120
No, the the young man. I who is tracking you a photo or

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.080
Uap with his equipment. That's not him. I just can't remember what his name is

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.720
Uh, you on reddit should have posted a live chat. That's all right, man. AJ green. That's the famous

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.800
Excellent bangles player. Good name. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yes

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:33.840
I will be covering the maje brazil crash and I will hopefully be able to be using mac maves studios footage on that

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.400
absolutely

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.440
uh

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.440
No, I cannot

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.840
The um first australian's triangle shaped constellation a group of triangle shaped. Okay

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.600
Basically, so three stars in the triangle formation. Did they move at all in the formation or did it stay pretty uniform?

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.240
um

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240
One sec. Sorry guys. I'm getting a call

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.520
I

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.920
Sorry guys

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.960
My bad. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to skip over that

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.120
UAP being controlled mostly by a mic's perfect sense also the craft piloted by actual biologic nhi

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.880
It was heavily declines the 60 70s and 80s nowadays nowadays mostly ai

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.480
So yeah, that that kind of boils down to like the von neumann self replicating probe, right?

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:23.440
I talked about that in the infographic show. That's a pretty interesting uh idea john michael godier

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.440
Who's a great he has a great youtube channel who talks a lot about kind of

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.560
uh

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:34.480
Fermi paradox extraterrestrial intelligence and so forth talks often about how von neumann probe is a very applicable solution to

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:41.440
uh spreading the civilization basically and into its own galaxy without violating faster than light travel

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.240
and so forth so the the some

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.480
Many uap being controlled by ai does make sense if we think to that infographics video

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:54.000
I think it's just like the basically the uh saucers and possibly triangles that are piloted such things as bells

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.120
Spheres and so forth are are mostly drones

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.840
Capital s pattern. Oh that is interesting

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.040
It is always it is extremely interesting when you see something

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.760
In the sky that is exhibiting flight patterns that you when you start to notice one of the five or six observables of uap

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.760
And assigning this super interesting

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:20.080
One of the best since it made up the story to get out of it. I've heard that too and if that's the case those men are some of the

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.280
smartest people alive to make up a uap abduction story to get out of a contract

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.600
I believe bob and there's a lot of things that were corroborated, but only is the education thing

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.760
Yeah, I think the education thing is a little too uh

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.960
Played out a little people focus on that too much. Of course, it's a valuable thing to use

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.280
To kind of talk against bob, but people bring that up too much. I believe

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.160
Uh

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.240
You have one of those signed too. Yeah, that's what you can't see here is the the reactor

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.280
Uh, and how the the sports model works too. This is just an excellent piece

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.240
psionics. Yes

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:05.600
Lazar is definitely a friday can email you all the proof study tis and type please please uap gur about uh gmail.com if you're still here, man

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.080
I I would like to to read that a lot

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.960
They can mess with our brains experiences

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.920
Correct stan freeman didn't like lasar. Yes

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.760
Yes, or stan freeman did talk against lasar quite a bit. I'm getting to the iceberg stuff

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:26.880
Okay, a lot of people are interested in the the iceberg. So yeah, I will um, I will get to that a little bit

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.040
So, okay. Yeah, tommy. We talked a little bit about the face peelers

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.200
uh

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.160
So if you're interested in jsoc look into the the squadron the 24th st. Yeah

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:45.760
Yes, there was somebody on reddit recently like a supposed whistleblower case somebody in the 24th sts who talked about his captain

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.480
Who was pulled away for very specific duties?

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.240
Occasionally and one time he talked about seeing some sort of craft that he said wasn't ours and was very shook from it

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.400
That's a really interesting story. I believe I have that downloaded if anybody wants me to share it with them

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.920
Cracker jack, thank you very much friends have different monies. Thank you very much

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.960
I really appreciate your support on the bottom of my heart

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.360
How many things see uh, see fives or a thing? It's just

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:18.720
I don't know. I need mods. I I'd like mods, especially as kind of the channel grows for this stuff

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.400
but

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400
you know, the thing is like

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.240
Everybody who types here is either wanting to talk to each other or talk to me

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.040
And I feel like I'm doing people a disservice if I'm just having somebody else filter out what they're saying like if you're typing out a

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.200
Message specifically to say something to me

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:43.840
You know, you are supporting this channel and I owe it to you to look at what you are saying and respond and think about it

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.960
so

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.000
mods

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.320
Mods be damned for the time moment. Um

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.240
I think that was our brain wash similar to benowitz. That's interesting

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.440
Uh, see over yeah, I I'd like to the gentleman who said he would talk to um

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.400
Or send me that information about lasar. I'd like to look at that as well. Greer is clearly a narcissist

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:09.040
I thought you said gerb for a second man. I was like, what the heck? But yes, I agree gerb rules you roll telekinesis beats

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.200
You're truly a young dolin. Thank you so much. Greer was an only option for many witnesses. This is an excellent point

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:20.640
I'm sorry for getting to this late. Greer is has been for many people the only option

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:26.560
Can I link to the greer briefing document? Yes, I can I'll make a community post on it. Okay

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.280
Posted on reddit. Thank you very

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:36.960
Yes, I've thought about this too. Um lasar after the congressional hearings did uh, I told you so but he hasn't testified

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.080
The heineck ufo report is excellent

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.480
Uh, the cia ufo paper is also excellent. I have not heard or I've not read ufo's generals pilots and government officials

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:51.360
I absolutely will I've linked to the ufo report and the cia ufo papers in a couple videos

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.920
So if anybody's interesting those I will watch it

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.720
The uh, okay hunting victor not out yet. Okay, but I will watch it when it comes out. I didn't know uh,

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.480
Or jog flay. Yeah, I has also mentioned that bob that he had to whoa

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:10.320
Green okay. Yeah, I need to study up a little bit on on that more because that's a pretty interesting theory

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.800
NASCAR mummies

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.480
He says slimes

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.520
Yeah, dude. I I'm still I still try to try to uh, not act not act too old

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.600
Do you have any really good uap videos? We might have seen I talked about this before but one of the videos

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:26.720
I think like lives in my head rent free is the video of the black triangle

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.800
I include a minute much of my b-roll footage

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.040
Check it out in my locky martin video

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:36.480
It's a footage from a handheld camera of a man taking a video of a black triangle in his backyard that exhibits four lights

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.120
One light at each vertices of the triangle and one

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.880
Uh, uh red light middle it takes off at a high speed at the end of the video

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.680
I don't know if that video is real or not. I'm not advocating for its credibility, but it's really interesting

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.240
What's up with the phoenix lights?

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640
fantastic case uh the

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.160
Conventional explanation is the a10 warthog flares, right? But then uh pipe or

01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.760
What's the dude?

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760
What's the governor's name who came out and said he

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.120
Was disappointed and how he reacted and coming on stage with an alien suit talking about the phoenix lights

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:11.680
The phoenix lights is one of the most interesting cases we have in the public domain in my opinion

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.840
What do you think about the four-chan whistleblowing that claims about ufo's? Yeah, so he talks about ufo's being made like a

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.920
or

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.920
respect per purpose that

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.200
Four-chan whistleblower is insanely interesting and I will

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.400
Still cover that full thing at some point because

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.080
I love that that story. It's just really interesting

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.720
Mods are not a good policy. Oh, oh, thank you. Tommy. I appreciate that brother mods are not a good freedom

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.440
Yeah, that's the thing too like

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.960
I really don't want some uh random person kind of telling people what they can and can't say

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.640
uh

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.480
You know, I don't want that howdy from lumberton texas. What's up, man? Thank you very much for joining in vegetable gremlin

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.040
It it can feel like that. Yeah, uh

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.360
UAP feels like it never ending circus. I I empathize with that and I understand

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.880
That's why I think it's so important to kind of pick and choose what you're studying at once

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.960
You know, you see with a lot of questions people ask me

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.360
I'll be pretty outright and say I have no idea what I think on the topic because I haven't studied it

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.760
In this field spreading yourself too thin is a

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.200
massive detriment. It's really a massive detriment. So

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.920
focusing on what you like to specialize in

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.680
researching that branching out occasionally but really trying to focus in on something you can make really good progress

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.120
My specialty what I like crash retrievals reverse engineering and speaking to witnesses

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.600
First-hand witnesses that is what I like. There's so much more in this domain outside of that

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:46.400
But I'm spreading myself too thin and probably being a little bit demoralized if I were to do that because I can't focus on as much

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.440
I have a playlist

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:56.000
If you look over it help you navigate the electromagnetic. Yes, please please please please send that to me uapgrub at gmail.com

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.880
Please I I'd love to review that on my flight

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.560
It's a great time to be alive might

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.280
And also it yeah, it is this is what an interesting time to be alive

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.240
Aquedia. Yeah aquedia Peru

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:20.160
Uh, I'm trying to think why can't I remember what case aquedia Peru is I've referenced it before but my mind is given a blank

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.600
A deep dive in a deep dive on if s4 was real I was went to the black at the idea that the bus would be 30 knots on hook

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.720
Uh, so one of the best

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.920
I want to do a deep dive on s4 and I have a fantastic document

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.440
I want to reference for that

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:42.800
It is the project Aquarius document that talks about dan barish and gives a detailed layout of all seven layers of s4

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.880
And I do want to cover that

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.120
I've been yes, um tenkai, please I I'd really like to read your research

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.880
5th simington. Yes, that's the names 4chan story seems to check out

01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.040
Uh, yeah, when he talks about the spheres in that he talks about them being like a hammer design, right? So

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.040
uh

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.920
Keep reading it. Okay. I've seen

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.480
uap

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.480
I've seen uap once at night three lights flying around rapid speed coming to an instant stop

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.120
okay

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.840
That is that is a very interesting case

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.160
So you saw three lights flying out of rapid speed

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.480
Coming to an instant stop

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.160
Changing colors and intensity and jumping like a mild and instant instantly continue done its previous path

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.560
That is extremely anomalous

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:37.840
Uh, oh I'm with the okay Puerto Rico. Yes, that is the case where there's uh, yes. Yes, okay

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.560
I know what you're talking about. That's the 2000. I think 18 footage

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.440
Where the uap is shown hovering over the town goes into water splits into two and rises

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.760
Uh tanner johnson. What's up brother? Yes, we are doing alive

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.280
How did you become interested in the ufo topic?

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.440
I think it's just the way my brain works ever since I could read one of my first ever books was on the

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.920
Betty and Barney hill abduction. I've been fascinated with the story since ever I

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.040
Since I could read since I knew how to think I have always been obsessed with ufos

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.920
But until I reached my recent age, I didn't really know how to express that, right?

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.720
and I finally came to a point in my life where I realized I has something to offer in terms of

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.360
treating the subject like I would a research paper in engineering having a thesis

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.360
Having a body of work having a body of references and making that into a video trying to make it entertaining that people could watch

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:34.320
Try and limit as much of my personal interest in in each video in each research project as much as possible and just deliver

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.400
the data

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:43.120
The facts the surrounding context on a topic. So this is just such an important topic for me. Do I believe dan barish is legitimate?

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.080
I don't know because I haven't done the um that dive yet

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.720
And I do know some interesting people who actually have no opinion on dan barish, which is interesting

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:57.360
Of course, he talks about j rod. He talks about uh j rod who uh bill u house talks about being retreated from the

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.480
Kingman crash the thing is with dan barish. He talks about two j rods

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.280
He talks about j rod uh ebe

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.040
5 3 az which is the kingman arizona j rod. No j rod two were recovered there

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.400
He says one was handed off to los alamos national labs one was given to

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.560
Uh, what's s4? He talks that that is a p 52, you know p 45

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.960
p 45 species and there's p 52 a riot species

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:29.520
So I need to do a deep dive because he's really interesting. I know the the youtube channel night shift did recently

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.520
So I'll probably wait a little bit

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.240
um

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:38.880
To let that all that die down and do like a full uh full research project. So you observed, um

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.680
An instantaneous deceleration and acceleration. That is fascinating

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:50.240
jimmy carter's ufo report. Yes jimmy carter is really so, um jimmy carter, of course

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:56.400
Was an advocate for uap and danie sheehan has stated he performed uap investigation for jimmy carter because of his interest

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.680
Can you try and vet?

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:06.080
Yes, absolutely. I will do that. Um, I'll do a I will do a full research project on his claims

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:13.040
Uh, his the project Aquarius and so forth because that that seems like a really interesting thing to explore op tv

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.240
Um, thank you very much. I really appreciate that

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.160
Do you know anyone approaching the uap subject from the instrumentation detection angle

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:29.360
There's your channel is launching model rockets into the anomalous phenomenon launching rocket. Yeah, I don't think I don't think that's a good idea

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.720
Yeah, there's that gentleman who's actually building really interesting detection software. I will find his name and I'll post about him

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.920
I'm sorry. I can't remember right now, but he is the guy right now

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.480
um

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.680
That's a yeah, that's the thing it with many sightings they last so briefly

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.480
You don't have time to get it on any filming mechanisms

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:55.840
Mods for time management. Obviously someone we will see we will see as we as we grow we might have more people chatting

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.720
The looking glass technology is really interesting. If you guys don't know what that is a danbury's claim

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.200
But I think level four or five and s4. There is some sort of uh, like time

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.280
manipulation project called project looking glass at s4

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.920
I'm always wary of involving ebe's living amongst human. Yes. I I am too. I always just

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:23.040
Taking them stepping back. Yes, uh, uh, northrop who kind of talked to I think it was

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.400
I know the video of him in a garden in which he discusses uap openly

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:34.400
And that is a very interesting video and when I eventually one day make a video about northrop grum and I will be referencing that

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.600
Uh, dude exchanging aliens isn't like human trafficking except with a

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:46.320
Yeah, it's yeah, exactly. Yeah, if danbury's is telling the truth, they're just swapping ali or et's like yugioh cards

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.320
You watching for recent. I have not if there are recent metapod videos. Please

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:56.880
Please show me if you guys think I'm just kind of lacking on that stuff. It's not I'm just so focused on a few aspects

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:03.840
Crafts retrieval reverse engineering and talking to people golden domes. Yes, I will be talking about this golden domes from danie shihan

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.760
If you guys don't know danie shihan has claimed that there's golden dome

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.840
What's known as golden dome and the cias technology used to detect uap even when they're cloaked

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:19.520
Thanks for the q&a. Hey, good night, brother. Good night, man. Good night from church. Nice, man. Have a great night

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:26.080
Agree on the looking glass comment research. Okay guys. I will uh finish up these comments. Then I got to hit the road

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.400
That's all right. I got a pack. I agree

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.880
yeah, so

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:36.560
Yeah, and this sort they're with danbury's there's so much to unpack it deserves a a lot of research

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:41.760
Yes, golden domes. We will absolutely be talking about that in the future

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:47.040
It was like a beacon going off on earth. They split the adamant. Yeah, that's a that's a great thing

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360
to talk about right like a

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.000
Huge influx of uap sightings post the first atomic bomb drop. I am of the mind

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.960
I do think there's been a presence on this phenomena for quite a long time

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.160
Uh, how long that is I don't know but I think the

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:05.440
If we may have lit up like a beacon with the first atomic bomb dropping

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.080
I do think there has been a presence on this planet longer

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.880
Since when do you have an interest in uap's forever?

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.640
I've talked about this a few times brother

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:18.800
But uh, I have had an interest in uap since I could think as a human and it has been one of my biggest passions

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040
And it wasn't until recently I learned I could

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.800
Actually try and do good on this subject

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:32.000
Just found your channel via jason juror. Who's jason shardrani if he's showing me out. Thank you, man. I appreciate that

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.720
Just for the record one sighting in austin ever moved. Okay, gotcha

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.440
Yes, I will cover the uap da because I never covered the 2023 variation

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.680
All right, I'll get through these and then I'm stopping with aj greens coming on iceberg

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.240
Have you ever looked in the contrail picture that when pull the pull? No, I have not but I will check that out brother

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.840
What if the reason why uap is so secretive is the nh i themselves don't uh you us

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.320
Disclose about their existence for whatever reason

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.760
Yeah, I I mean the the fact that the phenomenon itself isn't revealing itself is telling right?

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.720
Like they ultimately have the power to disclose themselves or not

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:14.160
Maybe they don't trust us. Maybe we are like maybe the zoo hypothesis has some truth to it that mainly we are just a piece of study

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.360
Thank you. Zach. I appreciate that man. I thank you for all of your comments on pretty much every one of my videos

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.120
She hands incredible. I uh jesse michaels has an interview coming out with she hand. I cannot wait for that

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.720
Hope you got a window seat. No man. I got the aisle. Um, but I'll probably have to trade for my girlfriend. So she'll have

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.600
I'll have a middle

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.520
Check out that. Yes. Well, unfortunately, I'll just be going to uh, tokyo and kyoto

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.920
I won't be have time to go to Hiroshima or Nagasaki

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.640
Fat rodents. Thank you

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.160
Uh, I built a technology that allows me to send chats and live streams from the past

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.280
They're super

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yeah, what?

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.080
Okay, uh, other two stars never moved up. That is very interesting

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:05.600
They don't like you here. Maybe it's just an uh impartialness to humans, right? Maybe it's just not even

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.800
Maybe we are to them. What answer to us?

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.120
Alpha zero. Hey, man. Nice to see you live. Thank you very much

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.080
But please don't fall into the black hole. Yes a lot of charlots and jokers. We talked about this earlier

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.840
I'll always do what I can to uh, kind of ground myself and

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320
Kind of not fall into

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:32.480
Unhealthy habits. Where am I going tokyo and kyoto? I am going to I will be training at kotokan in tokyo

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:37.840
For a little bit of judo too. You were born in uh, yukisoka. That's awesome, bro

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.560
I'm so excited to visit your beautiful country. It's been my top destination forever. And with that guys

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.560
I am going to hit the road. So I'll

I just feel so terrible about not providing content. So I might provide like some

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.560
Community posts a little bit like articles about stuff

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.920

01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:02.800

Absolutely safe travels. Thank you guys and I will when we get back get right back to the videos

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.720
