1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yo, yo, let me see if we are live.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can never get this right, can I?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Live.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What's up, everybody?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What up, Colin from Dubai?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How you doing, man?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, what up, John?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
John, Mr. Pico Graham.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, tell Jones to stop ducking Aspenall.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sick and tired of it.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're going to let some more people filter in.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm trying to kick a pretty foul mood at the moment.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you guys don't know, I'm a big American football fan

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and my team, the Cincinnati Bengals, just got smoked to a dreadful team.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we're just going to be, and I spent four and a half hours this morning

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
watching Greer.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So it's just been a strange day.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, we'll get through it.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Got a cold brew.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What are you guys up to, anyone?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do anything fun this weekend?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Got anything going on?

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let me adjust my lighting a little bit.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And the lecture was really interesting.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I have notes on every single aspect of the entire four hours.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So we're going to go through it kind of line by line.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have screenshots from the entire thing,

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and I kind of want to break down each of the PowerPoint slides

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and tricks in my hand.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Any advice for new content creators?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am still a new content creator,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and it's just kind of figuring it out as you go.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know if there's any answer, man.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I still don't know what the heck I'm doing, to be honest.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Watching NFL?

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, let's...

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I hate the sport.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I hate football, but I'll be watching next week.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What up, Alexander?

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How you doing, man?

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jones will never fight.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I know, and he's ducking him,

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
because John Jones knows he'd get smoked and knocked out in the first.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You went to a seven-hour general assembly of a political party.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You got in a word, hey, that's awesome, man,

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
for what subject, representing, or...

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's really cool.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Greetings from Germany.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hey, what's up, man?

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've only been to Frankfurt in Germany, and I loved it.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Four and a half hours with Greer is enough to sour anyone's day.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, when we get into it, it'll probably be really interesting to you.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The presentation was split up into halves.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So the first half of the webinar was talking all about,

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you know, the program, black programs, black sites that Greer wanted to discuss.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And the entire second half was about kind of new age stuff, consciousness, and so forth.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But we got all the slides.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We'll go through everything.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Soon 10K, I hope.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, Gluten, you got the flu, dude?

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What happened?

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I feel like you're...

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is my friend, Gluten.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I feel like you're ill just about every week.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I don't...

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I hope you're all right.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Doing great.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Love your deep dives.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I appreciate that.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We got one coming out soon this week, very soon.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello from Canada.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's up, dude?

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What part of Canada?

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Two lives.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I did.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I promised everybody we'd be doing one live a week.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I intend to keep that promise.

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Just a general memory till...

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's awesome.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And you're from Iceland, correct?

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I love it.

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wilder side.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's up, dude?

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello from Dubai.

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Event Horizon.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's up?

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you guys don't know Event Horizon, this is John Michael Goode.

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And his wonderful producer, Ross, I highly...

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, I'm sure you guys know about John's channel and the Event Horizon podcast.

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Both of these men are excellent individuals.

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I can't wait to be talking about him more in the future.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you guys don't know Event Horizon, go watch any episode.

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Any of John Michael Goode's videos on the Fermi Paradox are instant classics.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I highly recommend them.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
John is a huge inspiration for my channel in terms of just how he treats every video

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
almost like a research paper.

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It doesn't have any BS, kind of just the facts approach.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not really slick editing to kind of trick people with clickbait or anything like that,

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but just stick straight to discussing the topic.

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I love John Michael Goode.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All right.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Living in Malta near the border, British Columbia.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's awesome.

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I love it in the private party.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's awesome, man.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Congrats.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Originally from Arkansas, living in Malta.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, thank you so much, Rod.

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I know you.

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I really appreciate it.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Skip the matinee.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What were you seeing?

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alien, Beetlejuice.

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't know what else is out at the moment.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Event Horizon does rock.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
John Michael Goode rocks.

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Absolutely is awesome.

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
6 a.m. or where are you?

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you in Asia or Hawaii?

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was trying to do this one a little bit earlier so we could get some of the EU fellers

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and especially because this program had to do with London.

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you, Ross and John.

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I will talk to you guys soon.

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I appreciate that, man.

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really appreciate it.

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Have I ever seen Janet's YouTube channel?

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Very interesting, clear footage of UAPs.

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've heard of the channel, but I haven't sat through and watched a ton of the videos.

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will have to though.

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's just so much to analyze lately without even touching footage.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Recently, I talked to John and Ross from Event Horizon.

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's something that all of us are on the same page on.

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A lot of the times, footage is useful or useless for furthering the conversation.

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thanks, Ross.

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I appreciate that, man.

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you very much.

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Much love.

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you for the support.

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's awesome.

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Greetings from the UK.

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Perfect.

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I wanted some of my friends from across the pond in here.

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's wonderful.

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Can you do a video where you analyze Green Street and other skeptics claims?

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Absolutely.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'd love to.

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Green Street is a strange one.

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There's something that makes me irrationally angry whenever I see a tweet of his because

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I know it has an 8 out of 10 probability of containing the words alien space monster

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
or spooky aliens or something like that.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That sounds great.

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Green Street, maybe a little bit more Sean Kirkpatrick work, I think would be excellent.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Absolutely.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Way to kick off the week.

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you, Django.

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
My mom's dog's name is Django.

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Nice to see you, new subscriber.

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you very much, man.

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I really appreciate that.

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
First video, when you get it, feel free to drop the link.

166
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'd love to watch it.

167
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How about we get started with the, yes, Green Street does have DOD ties.

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He does.

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, Norway Oslo here, man.

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was just in Oslo last September.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
My girlfriend is Norwegian.

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I loved it.

173
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can get the link.

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, please, brother.

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's start with Steven Greer's event.

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This wasn't nearly as publicized as something like the 2023 National Press Club event.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm not exactly sure why.

178
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I know Greer put a lot of effort into kind of getting a lot of attention towards that.

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This was done in London.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A bit strange as there were different tiers to kind of witness the event.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The webinar itself was $50.

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It was really weird, but there was also a $75 in-person ticket to go see.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
She know if you're watching that, let me hear how it was.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then you could pay $1,500 for a meet and greet with Steven Greer.

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Like a dinner because the way the event went from three to seven o'clock London time was

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Steven Greer's lecture and webinar, he says, and workshop.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There was no workshop.

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There was no worksheets, but this was split into two distinct tabs as I'll kind of get to.

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
After that, there was a dinner with Steven Greer and then a premiere of the lost century,

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Steven Greer's newest documentary.

191
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think that is free to stream on Peacock maybe or it's free to stream on some service.

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I recommend watching it.

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I know it features a lot of artwork by Michael Schrat and I really respect Michael Schrat

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and love his work.

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I still do think any of Greer's work is worth watching and then kind of analyzing

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and dissecting from there.

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's get through these.

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you think Steven Greer tries to bring forth any actual whistleblowers?

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In this event, no.

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He only talks about mostly whistleblowers.

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We know.

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In fact, Steven Greer had himself a viewing of a UFO witness list and decided to reiterate

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
some of that.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I think right now he's on the warpath of trying to kind of to identify these black

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
operation sites, two of which he mentioned in the video.

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And we'll go through those.

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll pull up the exact actually three of them he mentioned in the video.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I got exact coordinates to all of them.

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So we'll kind of go through there and keep going.

210
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Gluten, some swag would be legit.

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I would like that.

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'd like to do some black stuff with some just stitched logos on there.

213
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's free on rumble.

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's free on rumble.

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So I recommend watching that.

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I recommend watching unacknowledged.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just anything by Greer is worth a watch.

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The production value on his documentaries are generally very high.

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it's still good to, yeah, cult leader.

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
A lot of this conference was about CE five.

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I remember.

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So for my discord, I had live notes in there just kind of telling everybody what was going

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
on with screenshots and stuff like that.

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And Greer would go on like 25 minute diatribes talking about like his near death experience

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
at 17 or a lucid dream of the future.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And that's fine and dandy, but to spend, you know, a significant amount of time in a workshop

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
where people are paying money to go see.

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm a little bit, uh, I'm a little bit, uh, not huge on that.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So let's start.

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm going to share my screen and we'll just kind of go through things a bit slowly as people

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
start to trickle in because there is some really interesting stuff Greer talked about

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and some interesting connections as well.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So I need to remember how the heck to share my screen.

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Cinema layout presents.

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Share screen.

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Tire screen.

237
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, cool.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So let's see what everybody's saying.

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Um, Greer.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Exactly.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Greer should not be ignored, although he is controversial for anyone saying, please try

244
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
CE five.

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh, you want to understand it?

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I would like to understand it.

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I still have not tried CE five.

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Greer says he has, uh, tutorials on how to do such a thing.

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But, uh, you know, it's why not explore it and then kind of, uh, come up with a conclusion

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
there.

251
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But so some of the things Greer talked about in this was, uh, uh, talking about new top

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
secret witness testimony.

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He didn't really reference any new top secret testimony.

254
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We'll go through everybody he did talk about.

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You'll know some familiar players from my channel.

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He references Michael Herrera.

257
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He references TB, which I thought was in somewhat of strange taste.

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He went, uh, mentions MS.

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Uh, witness, TE or ET.

260
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can't remember in which direction in the disclosure project archives.

261
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's 10, eight, nine, two.

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The guy who discussed a fake abductions and programmable life forms will kind of touch

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
into, uh, besides that, um, Greer posts two images of blacks.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I T visited from last year.

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Neither of these images he posted are from his actual visit.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
One of them is from Google Earth.

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Another one is a ripoff of one of my images, which was kind of funny to see, uh,

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
meetings between Dr. Greer and key members of Congress.

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We have a couple of notes on that.

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So let's, um, let's start going through things.

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I have, uh, power.

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have screenshots of every single slide that Greer had.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm just going to get all these.

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We'll go one by one.

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sorry.

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What the heck?

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
My bad guys.

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So for, uh, Greer's first, he gave a little kind of preamble when he was talking about

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
serious disclosure and so forth.

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Greer states that his first CE five attempt occurred in 1992 in England at the height

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of crop circles.

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Greer claimed that his initial CE five event led to a crop circle that inspired his CE

285
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
five logo, which is this.

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So Greer stated that, um, he summoned a UAP craft, eat this crop circle with this design

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
appeared.

288
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And then he saw a large saucer like design in a field.

289
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That was new to me.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I know Greer kind of states that since he was like 18, he even said this in the, uh,

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
presentation that he had kind of figured out how the universe works, which I find a

292
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
little bit egotistical.

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm not going to lie.

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Even if a CE five has some real practices to it, I don't think it's very humble to

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
state you understand how the universe works as a 17 year old man.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But this is how kind of serious disclosure and so forth came to be.

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So his initial slide, some of the points he wanted to talk about were, um, he approached

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
this sort of webinar as kind of like a kindergarten level briefing for individuals.

299
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He kept saying in the first couple of slides that, you know, whoever watches this, it's

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
going to absolutely blow your mind.

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like you're going to be crying when you leave this year.

302
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're not going to really be able to understand what you just saw.

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And to be honest, there wasn't too much like new information here.

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss, but there wasn't a lot of really new, um,

305
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
information.

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So something that Greer does state on these first couple of slides is when, when he was

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
young, a gatekeeper to the program who tried to kind of not really buy Greer off, but to,

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
um, but intimidated Greer.

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So Greer said that Major Albert Stubblebine was this individual.

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Stubblebine has mentioned multiple times in the witness list.

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So sorry, spell check.

312
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So Greer has a witness, 10, 5, 9, 9, who worked with Major Stubblebine for four years, has

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
documents, recording interviews and others to back up his claims.

314
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've found no, none of those documents in the DP archive.

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Uh, he also taught Greer has a witness, 10192 of an ex remote viewer under Stubblebine,

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
um, and so forth.

317
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But here is a really interesting witness guys.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Uh, check this out.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
610658.

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I noticed this a lot.

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I noticed this a lot earlier when I was kind of reading through the DPR.

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I cried the first time.

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So Greer has a witness 10658.

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He says that this witness has been involved in the sixties, former head of Fort Huachuca.

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I hope I'm saying that right.

326
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And if I'm not, I'm sorry.

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Fort Huachuca, army intelligence where ET craft and body are stored.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He says this because later when Greer posts his facility list, he talks about Fort Huachuca

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
being a really kind of key facility.

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well guys, now here's what's interesting.

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So major Albert Stubblebine Greer says this person intimidated him.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's go to look at the, um, let's look at the army intelligence center in school at

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So this is the Fort Huachuca who was in charge of, sorry, let me back up for a second.

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
When Greer talks about Fort Huachuca, which we'll address later in the video, he says

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that the person he spoke to ran a Fort Huachuca and discussed ET craft and ET bodies in the

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
1970s.

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay.

340
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So check this out.

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Brigadier General Eugene Kelly Jr. took command of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center in school

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This was in the year 1975.

344
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But this is rather interesting.

345
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In 1977 at Fort Huachuca, he relinquished his command to General Albert Stubblebine.

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So Stubblebine could very well be this witness right here, 10658, somebody who has been involved

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
with the 60s, former head of Fort Huachuca Army Intelligence where ET craft and bodies

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
are stored.

349
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
When later in the video we'll talk about Greer referencing a source at Fort Huachuca who

350
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
worked there in the 70s to talk about ET craft and bodies.

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But this is also somewhat at odds with Greer's original statement that Stubble, Stubblebine

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
specifically tried to intimidate him.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But I would have a high bet here that this is probably General Albert Stubblebine.

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So Greer states he was approached by insiders when he was a 30, when he was in his 30s.

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He labeled these guys as white hats or good guys or blue team as we'll discuss earlier.

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you remember from the majestic video, kind of blue team, red team, these are often labeled

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to be UFO craft retrieval operators.

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So don't get that confused as we talk about blue team guys.

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
These are going to be guys that Greer states are black program insiders who are kind of

360
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
good guys who want the truth to come out.

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
People Greer states were sent to him because top brass in the Pentagon weren't read into

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the UFO situation.

363
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Greer makes a direct mention to briefing Admiral Thomas Wilson, which of course is now really

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
interesting with Eric Davis confirming the Wilson Davis notes.

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But he also talks about him briefing the CIA director in the early 90s.

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I know this is a contentious point about Greer briefing the CIA director.

367
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I believe he states he sat down and briefed the director.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I believe the counter argument to that is Greer just blasted out an email to the CIA

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
director who just kind of read it and threw it in the bin.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I'm not sure if that conversation has advanced very much.

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Stubblebind died in 2017.

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah.

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He's no longer with us.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So we can't be contacted here.

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And Greer says a lot of this kind of contact about good guys, white hats, blue team in the

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
air who contacted him wanting to kind of restore oversight to black programs was under the Clinton

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
administration.

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So this for me is a new line of research to head down kind of what went on under the Clinton

379
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
administration.

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So let's go on to slide two.

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Sorry.

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Sorry.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Wrong window.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's go on to slide two.

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Here Greer talks about how if you guys remember the 2001 disclosure briefing document, I highly recommend it.

386
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let me pull it up.

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you guys have never read this document, it is brilliant.

388
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's it's Greer's best piece of work.

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I will always stand by that.

390
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is fantastic.

391
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But Greer states he was asked to make his disclosure briefing document in order to brief Senate intelligence and the

392
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
armed services staff.

393
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So this would have been in the early, mid to late nineties.

394
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Greer states he was contacted by the most senior person, a staff for Senate of the gang of eight.

395
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And this member of the gang of eight and his senior staff are kind of knocked on the doors internally in the

396
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Department of Defense and the Pentagon, but were denied.

397
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So Greer also states he was brought in a skiff, but didn't need clearance.

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Because his DPR DPI archive had more actionable intelligence and information than the intelligence community on UAP.

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So that was pretty, that was pretty interesting to me.

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Greer was then approached kind of earlier in the 2020s into a skiff.

401
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He said he brought the Trump presidential briefing document to a skiff.

402
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We know that Lou Elizondo and Ross Colt Hart have stated that Trump has brought in a skiff.

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Trump has been somewhat, if not fully briefed into the UAP situation.

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I still haven't really researched that.

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I don't really have an opinion.

406
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Greer likes to add in these little details to kind of add drama.

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's great showsmanship actually.

408
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It kind of really engages the audience.

409
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He says in this specific meeting there was a bourbon bottle in the middle of the table.

410
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Within 10 minutes, the intelligence guys were desperately reaching for the bottle.

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's just a little bit of unnecessary fluff.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Greer states he has been in skiffs multiple times, each with top secret, secret, compartmentalized intelligence.

413
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Clearance folks who were all astonished at how long Stephen Greer has been doing this, pushing for disclosure.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So Greer now kind of talks about this law enforcement update.

415
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And this is where things get really interesting guys.

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So if you're kind of halfway paying attention, I would lock in here because this is a little bit of new stuff from Greer.

417
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Greer states he is in contact with top tactical operations people.

418
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
These are Green Berets, SEALs, JSOC people who are all coming together behind closed doors to support Greer.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
All these commanders, these current tactical operations officers are seeking briefings from Greer.

420
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They have been asked by somebody, not sure because Greer doesn't devolved to bring black projects back under congressional oversight.

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So in summary, Greer's stating that a lot of JSOC leaders are being asked to bring the program back under control and moving with Greer.

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is very interesting.

423
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Greer says, and I quote, that there are plans or possible plans to quote unquote, roll on dugway proving grounds, Area 51, Edwards Air Force Base and other black sites.

424
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Roll on.

425
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He says, take them back.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If taking these sites back involves any sort of force or a legal entry or brute force entry, does this not egregiously violate OPSEC?

427
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Because I think what Greer is referring to is by force taking back these sites that he says are under black project control because Greer also goes on to state that black program leaders dwarf Hitler and the Nazis,

428
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
which, you know, that's always never a in great taste.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes, he has mentioned this before on kind of podcast before about forcibly enter entering these sites.

430
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But I don't think he's fully pieced everything together with kind of who he's talking to in order to do that.

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But I could absolutely be wrong.

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For the SAP whistleblower protection Greer has been talking about.

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Since June, 2024, Greer has been tasked and with others for providing OPSEC for whistleblowers, 762 of these according to Greer.

434
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
These cover individual for all firsthand individuals according to Greer, people who are there when craft were shot down, reverse engineered, etc.

435
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The program is operational for US whistleblowers only with his show in.

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It could be wrong.

437
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I very well could be wrong.

438
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We're talking about Greer's project today, his speech in London, his event there.

439
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There was a webinar.

440
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There was an in it kind of in person show I bought the pay per view.

441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So we're talking about that.

442
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Florian, thank you very much.

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I really appreciate that.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank you very much.

445
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He might have talked about it on Sean Ryan.

446
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He might have.

447
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I got to listen to that again.

448
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But yeah, Greer does suck at OPSEC something will continue to talk about today.

449
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So yeah, so this this program Greer States is for US whistleblowers only.

450
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He's trying to get something set up in the UK.

451
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He basically asks for funding and backing there.

452
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And this is a special access program to protect firsthand whistleblowers from presumably threats on their life.

453
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Greer talks about deep cover defectors.

454
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And he addresses this in parallel to catastrophic disclosure.

455
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He states there's a group currently with performing operations within black projects who are trapped within the system.

456
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Greer States is trying to work with these people to kind of, you know, bring these black operations back under congressional oversight or possibly roll on them if that needs be.

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Greer also goes on to talk about how after his viewing of a dumb entrance, which we'll talk about soon, he was almost killed.

458
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is a gross exaggeration.

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He fell.

460
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He fell off his bike.

461
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So yeah.

462
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So sorry, let me let me get through a couple of comments here.

463
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's see Greer sucks at OPSEC got my PC admitting he I'd like to see that if you would like to post that.

464
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
As well.

465
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Lazar was used for soft disclosure.

466
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Get the attention of Harry Reid.

467
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
He was 23 and an eccentric.

468
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Interesting.

469
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes, I have that's that's also great.

470
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I think that's kind of making the news rounds of late.

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Very interesting.

472
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So Greer likes to state that 90% of what is known in ufology is disinformation.

473
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He states he has the 10% that is considered real information included in the 90%.

474
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This is a slide from the presentation is that we don't have man made UFOs.

475
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This is a point kind of I have really sort of changed my position on in the past few months.

476
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The alien threat interdimensional phenomena, which is weird because Greer will later on in the second half of this presentation talk about internet interdimensional phenomena.

477
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
ETs are demons, abductions, weapons in space.

478
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
When the truth and we'll kind of get into this in the second half as well is really kind of new age woo stuff.

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
If you if you guys know what that is about kind of raising consciousness, vibrations, stuff like that.

480
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
See, peaceful CE5 contact enlightenment, universal peace.

481
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I'm not saying there's nothing to that.

482
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I just think it's a I always think it's interesting when people claim to have all the answers when Greer says that 90% of what's known in ufology.

483
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is disinformation, but his 10% is the true information.

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Greer talks about DPI archive.

485
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He says that it will take years for people to sift through all the information.

486
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's just demonstrably untrue.

487
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We can sit through the info here.

488
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Of course, we have 13 sections here.

489
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Greer says he has a 14th session here that he can't wait to talk about and post on the site.

490
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So I'm really excited to see that.

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Or thank you so much.

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I really appreciate that.

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Starbucks is extremely, extremely expensive.

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Consciousness is the key to all of this.

495
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I absolutely agree.

496
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
There's there's much of kind of human cognition, human consciousness in terms of the UAP phenomena.

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I just find it a little bit strange when Greer says that his 10 he is the one who holds 10% of the true information.

498
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So Greer, and now is when we'll kind of go into a little bit of the discussion of some of the whistleblowers and witnesses he talks to.

499
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Something I took special note of, which I found kind of funny is Greer talks about the pages and pages, the 23 pages of redacted witnesses.

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But Greer says he likes to honor the whistleblowers request for confidentiality.

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Anybody who's seen any of my videos will know that's just his operational security is absolutely dreadful.

502
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So next we'll start talking about illegal operations, locations, corporations based on intel from his witnesses.

503
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You guys know the Greer facility list.

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
If you don't let me pull that up facilities maps and list.

505
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So Greer has all of these facilities, including maps pointing towards them.

506
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Sorry, that looks nice and reversed colors.

507
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
All of these are garnered from the pages of witness testimony here.

508
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
For example, you know, we can look at Dugway Proving Grounds as given by MS.

509
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
We can go over here to a little place in Indiana where we might know a spot and so on.

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But and so Greer talks about now the first dumb entrance to which he was taken to.

511
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This is he states is the anthill in the eastern desert of California or western desert of Nevada.

512
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Let me pull up with this place is called because I actually found it and I need to.

513
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Sorry guys just give me a second here.

514
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I need to find out exactly what this place is called again.

515
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So I can get you guys exact exact locations.

516
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Greer states this location that we're talking about is basically an entrance to a dumb or a deep underground military base.

517
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
If you can go online, you can find this exact place.

518
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Sorry guys.

519
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's what's known as a volcanic cinder cone like volcano offshoots.

520
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Greer stating this is a dumb entrance and let me pull up the exact place.

521
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Sorry.

522
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I forgot what this place is is called.

523
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Is it called the Salt Lake?

524
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yes.

525
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay.

526
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Got it.

527
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
If you want to find this place on Google Maps, this is called the Salt Lake Cinder Cone.

528
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay.

529
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
This is the exact entrance that Greer is stating is a dumb entrance right here the Salt Lake Cinder Cone.

530
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I can get a nice zoom in.

531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This, as I said, is a cinder cone.

532
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We can look by because these generally occur near volcanic activity.

533
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And I think there's a volcano located about 25 miles or so northeast of this location.

534
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm not sure if these are other cinder cones.

535
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm not a rock specialist, but this location right here.

536
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't understand where the entrance here is.

537
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
If anything, this possibly could be dirt moved for underground locations, but I don't know where an entrance could be in this location.

538
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Let me say a couple, thank you guys real fast.

539
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And we got the next location to talk about a little something to somewhere.

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Thank you very much.

541
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Tell us and thank you for the boost too.

542
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I really appreciate that.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Maglevs connecting all the DUNS.

544
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yes, we will talk about that too because Greer touches on it.

545
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Sorry.

546
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
My questions are, are you familiar with Northrop Ant Hill?

547
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah.

548
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Greer calls this Northrop Ant Hill, I think.

549
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm actually, because he calls this the Ant Hill as a DUM.

550
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So he calls this, yeah, as we can see the Ant Hill.

551
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Sorry.

552
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Okay.

553
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Crackerjack, thank you very much.

554
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Greer stones.

555
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I turn over.

556
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Greer does awesome work and he, I still recommend checking out all of his documentaries and kind

557
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
of paying attention to what he says because it's very interesting.

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So you guys will probably know this site.

559
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Next, Greer talks about the Hellendale site, the Lockheed Martin Hellendale site.

560
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Now what's really interesting here guys is let's get back to the DPI archive.

561
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So if we go to UFO kind of secret related facilities, top priority documents and so forth with some photos of stuff.

562
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
A Hellendale location, there used to be multiple images on here.

563
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So I'm not quite sure why Hellendale was taken off of the DPI archive.

564
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And I can also state for a fact that within the presentation today, Greer didn't mention Hellendale.

565
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So I don't know, I really don't understand what the play here was.

566
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I don't know who this is attempting to kind of confuse or fool, especially because people in my discord, as I post this live, there was a user.

567
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's really smart guy.

568
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
His name is rectified.

569
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
He knew he said immediately, hey, this is Hellendale.

570
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I'm sure multiple people recognize it as well.

571
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So within the presentation, Greer stated that he didn't say the name Hellendale and the images of Hellendale have been stripped off the DPI archive.

572
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But he Greer states that this director of black operations took him to this Hellendale site.

573
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He says that this Hellendale plant is a staging ground for electro gravitic ARV or alien reproduction vehicle.

574
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'll be saying ARV the rest of the time.

575
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The diamonds here on the runway Greer states are for using kind of scalar technologies.

576
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So scalar technologies to kind of test human made ARVs and their resilience to kind of EMP weaponry or to bring down ET craft.

577
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Greer states that I think one to two craft are brought down by this site in particular, maybe all sites a year.

578
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He also brings up an image of this site at the Hellendale plant says this is EMP weaponry.

579
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And that the EMPs are used in conjunction with scalar technology to knock out craft a year that this site has been operational for black program duties for upwards of 40 years.

580
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The person the black operations director who flew him over this Greer states in this presentation that this same individual has personally been present at ET craft shoot down and personally recovered craft and bodies.

581
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So real fast Florian, thank you so much.

582
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I really appreciate the euros from Germany.

583
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Have you seen above majestic I have.

584
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
What is your take about alien human bases on the mood and Antarctica and space travel for decades now.

585
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There's a lot of really interesting kind of witnesses in the DPI archive specifically about UFO and NHI signatures on the moon and I would like to explore those further.

586
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't think they're out of the realm of possibility.

587
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I just think that that specific topic needs a lot of a lot more hard nose research, a lot more hard nose research.

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So next, as you guys know from the facilities list.

589
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Greer has a list of numerous, numerous, numerous, numerous facilities.

590
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Most if not all of these guys have been referenced in the DPI archive.

591
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Sorry, I'm the 2001 disclosure briefing document.

592
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
See here, China Lake.

593
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm in that place.

594
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So I don't think much has changed on this facility list.

595
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Greer also talked about this in a 2016 speech.

596
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I have referenced quite a bit, including my work on Doug way.

597
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I mean, this is I haven't fully taken a look yet, but this is just copied verbatim since 2001 or I think 1996 is when this specific place was or this specific list was compiled for the DPI archive.

598
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So we'll keep going.

599
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Sorry, I'm just kind of trying to organize my notes.

600
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
A lot of the times my notes are sloppy are pretty sloppy.

601
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Continuing on with the sites.

602
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, Greer made specific reference here.

603
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Very specific reference here is about the Los Alamos National Labs.

604
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I know you guys have probably all heard of Los Alamos National Labs, but he talks about a maglev system under Los Alamos connecting it to other dumb locations.

605
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He states, I don't know how he got this intel, but he states that Los Alamos has direct access to Kirtland AFB and Dulce.

606
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I can never, you guys know, I don't know how to speak, but Greer likes to kind of claim here that any above ground duties about the Dulce base are completely false.

607
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And this is just one large below ground dumb.

608
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There's a lot of interesting work on this.

609
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I can't remember exactly what the pieces right now that I've talked before UFO highway.

610
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It might be called, which is a good PDF that talks about the Dulce location.

611
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Greer says that this Dulce place is where it contains biotech labs where fake ETS, aka PLF programmable life forms are made.

612
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Interesting to me as well Greer state specifically that some of these dumps were built in the 1980s.

613
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
At least in my research, I feel like I've seen plenty of discussion that dumps have come come around a little bit before that.

614
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But I do want to bring something up about, sorry, I do want to bring something up about in the DPR archive.

615
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I seem to have ex exed out of that tab, but Greer has some patents for a huge boring underground boring machine that he states was used for kind of building these maglev systems.

616
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Creating the deep underground military bases.

617
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes, it is.

618
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is Jack Ramanson's gym.

619
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I love repping this gym.

620
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Awesome gym.

621
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay, look, keep going here.

622
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And now at this time because Greer has multiple pages he talks about in terms of underground bases that we already have listed on that primary site.

623
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sorry, trying to pull this up.

624
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
He again talks about Fort Hachuca.

625
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And again, I will reference that I believe that the witness 10658 in the DPR archive is really major Albert Stubblebine, which conflicts of Stephen Greer's earlier claims that Stubblebine tried to intimidate and create fear within Stephen Greer.

626
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Interesting reference here about Pine Gap underground facility in Australia.

627
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
He says this is a transnational majestic location.

628
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Doesn't say majestic 12 just as majestic.

629
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Now, I do know of an intelligence guy.

630
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He's a friend of mine who says he has been to Pine Gap and didn't see anything there doesn't think anything could be there.

631
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But then again, I don't think he was given access to the entire facility.

632
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Mention of Doug way proving grounds outside here will go.

633
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Okay, so when I interviewed MS, I think I gave very vague directions to the entrance that he claimed was for the Doug way dumb.

634
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I just said it was near German village in Utah.

635
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Greer gives.

636
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
In fact, he gets my pin for this place.

637
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So I can give you guys that exact location to and because Greer has kind of violated this upset here.

638
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Greer talks about UFO related facilities and companies here.

639
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I don't think anything really new is going to stand out here.

640
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
He adds kind of in the he has talked about this in his 2016 briefing.

641
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I think this is what he added that SAIC is a crown jewel here because in the same presentation he mentions.

642
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Sorry, he also mentions I talked about her in my NSWC video with RA about the testimony of Denise McKenzie, a former SAIC employee who would talk about

643
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
being large contracts with nothing actually on the books.

644
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So next we move on to a witness.

645
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I actually hadn't seen and this can be pretty interesting.

646
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So Greer talks about project mannequin in 1997, a top secret underground based genetic engineering PLFs, please in P'smore UK under witness BK.

647
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And you guys know that I will give you the exact witness name.

648
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Well, this isn't one, but this is somebody connected to this witness BK witness 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive.

649
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Again, that's 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive.

650
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And here's the witness 10 412.

651
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This is the witness that Greer is stating has information on PLFs and an underground dumb in the UK.

652
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So project mannequin at RAF P'smore has seen and touched gray beans bred in NSA underground base evidence of military committing abductions globally.

653
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So in the DPI archive.

654
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
10 412.

655
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We won't go through all these documents right now.

656
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But under 10 412 this individual BK.

657
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There's quite a bit of interesting documents to research, including some alleged actual documents smuggled out of this project mannequin, which is presumably to make PLFs.

658
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:49,000
According to this individual, there are also sketches from this individual BK about the creation of PLFs, the manufacturing of like a classic gray and so forth.

659
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And that this project mannequin is also in charge of making what we would think of as the classic reptilian design along with the grays.

660
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I think project came a lot interviewed the piece more winners. I haven't seen that I'll absolutely have to check that out.

661
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So, and now this will be one that kind of me close some of these tabs guys. Sorry.

662
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let me close some of these tabs. Greer then gets into the infamous TV.

663
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So, out of respect.

664
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I am not going to talk about who TV might be or his name.

665
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I understand that's definitely out there.

666
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And people know about this individual or might know, but so I'm not going to bring that up, but there's plenty about there.

667
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So, initially, this Lawton, Oklahoma case with TV, this is in reference to some statements by TV to Stephen Greer in which some technology was leveraged from this crash that was used at Fort Sill, Oklahoma base in 2003,

668
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,000
where General John M. Riggs showed off classified cloaking technology to a BAE systems employee, where he was then unceremoniously retired.

669
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Now, the kernels of truth in this statement are that General John M. Riggs was in fact demoted a star upon his retirement and sent basically to the basement of the Pentagon and handed in his clothes and said,

670
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,000
you're gone. So, he was very unceremoniously retired and according to I think it's a Baltimore Sun article. This was for improper use of contractors.

671
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So, I think I have these in my video with TV, but Greer just kind of posts some images of kind of the crash retrieval that occurred in Lawton according to TV.

672
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,000
He also posts this ARV looks very, I don't think this is actually in reference to an ARV according to Greer, but posts a craft in an underground facility.

673
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What we would probably know as Mark McCandless is Fluxliner ARV. Fluxliner, if you know that name, Greer also at the end of the project says that the Fluxliner name was actually used for Lockheed's first generation of ARV craft.

674
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I didn't know this because this wasn't provided in the notes with TV, but apparently this location right here is an underground base actually in Oklahoma near Fort Sill.

675
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So, that might be a location to look at Fort Sill, the Lawton area for any sort of bases down there. Greer also states that some craft shot down break into pieces while others have sort of a controlled landing due to being stunned.

676
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This has more relevance to the infographics whistleblower when he's talking about eggs and bells, bells being the most commonly crashed craft and that the vast majority of the time they almost disintegrate break into pieces or basically melt away like nothing is there.

677
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So, that's an interesting connection there. Greer dropped some specific terminology when he was talking about this location when we get a sip of cold brew.

678
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:08,000
He states that retrieved NHI living bodies are not referred to as extraterrestrials. They are kind of referred to as evens, extraterrestrial biological entities as you know but with an N on the end.

679
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But these individuals that are taken alive are called captives or refugees and those are the exact words but used by Greer.

680
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Next on to Mr. MS, we know him very well. So, at this point covering a TB and MS back to back we got a little UFOs witness list action going on which you know I always like to see.

681
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Greer talks a little bit more and gives a little bit more insight apparently because apparently he has some more connections and things to study about the craft that MS saw.

682
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
If you guys remember from that video MS stated to have seen like a basically inverted cone triangle section at the bottom of the craft.

683
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,000
New drawing here from Greer's archives. I wonder if this is a shrap drawing if it is that's great Michael Schratz the best.

684
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But Greer states to have some insight on this on the pyramid we talked about which we kind of I don't really remember if I hypothesized about it.

685
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But Greer stated that he kind of knew factually that this inverted pyramid is an EMP crystalline structure that causes objects to basically travel instantaneously.

686
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It likens the abilities of this piece to like a astral projection functionality.

687
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This is a good question why are all these people talking to Greer instead of Congress could they be doing the latter in secret they absolutely could remember we talked about TB and his witnesses in his messages to Greer here was summoned to testify before members of the gang of eight including Marco Rubio in 2022.

688
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah whistleblower protection is terrible remember guys the witness or whistleblower protection doesn't cover pensions so that was something that Greer had stated kind of in media about specifically TB that he was afraid for both his life and his pension.

689
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So even with these whistleblower acts your pension is not covered and love these guys with families and stuff this is presumably what they're worried about.

690
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Okay MS Dugway render we know this from the video.

691
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We know this from the video group post some images.

692
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
These look these look a little familiar to me.

693
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But so let's go to the exact entrance.

694
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
German village in am I going to Utah I don't know if I'm going to Utah.

695
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well before I get to that.

696
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Group post an untitled place mark changing the colors of a plate of a mark that could only be me but so the Greer posted this on the DPI archive okay I'm just going to show that once again in his recent updates.

697
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It was in.

698
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Wow, I guess he just took that off really recently.

699
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Okay.

700
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Last time I checked this in the critical updates Greer had posted image for the anthill and the Dugway site in Greer's presentation he posts this image for the Dugway location.

701
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And let me try and find it.

702
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Dugway German village.

703
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I got to remember my exact location now here guys.

704
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Let me think.

705
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Let me I got to think about the exact coordinates here.

706
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh man this might be tough a little bit south of Dugway German village.

707
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We might be we're on the money.

708
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
This is the location he provided.

709
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:16,000
This is allegedly the entrance to the dumb right here according to what Greer posted in his September 8 2024 London press conference right.

710
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Just a bit northwest of Dugway German village.

711
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So I was a little interested to see him post that, but especially if he is talking about taking back such sites.

712
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I found that a little interesting.

713
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But now we can talk a little bit about a witness we talked about a little bit last week in the Greer archive about programmable life forms and so forth.

714
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
This is witness TE.

715
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
If you want to follow along in the DPI archive you can search witness 10892.

716
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Again that's 10892 and find relevant documents.

717
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
German village. Where is German village.

718
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Just search Dugway German village.

719
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Right here.

720
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Dugway German village. Just a little bit northwest of this location.

721
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So, yeah, it talks about TE. This is a witness we talked a little bit about last week.

722
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And the story of TE is this individual approach Greer claimed to be on a specialized ARV retrieval team.

723
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Some artwork included here. I think this might be Rudy Garcia and some of Greer's team this artwork is really cool.

724
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,000
This kind of triangle site is man made craft as you can see by the no step.

725
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
This must be work by Michael Schrat, but it's a kind of a CAD drawing of this same device, the same craft.

726
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And eventually at some point this witness TE 10892 graduated from kind of ARV retrieval and was promoted to ET retrieval.

727
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So this event occurred and I can't remember what year this was. I know it's listed in the archive.

728
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This might have been 2004.

729
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Early 2000s where a sunflower type craft what crashed near or not crashed I'm sorry landed near Nellis.

730
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
As you can see Greer also make specific mention to this ARV that was privy to this retrieval operation.

731
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
If you can see here there's some soldiers lying in wait.

732
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:36,000
This witness TE stated that as individuals approach this craft basically autonomy was taken away from all the soldiers and they were sent into basically like a stunned state.

733
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Out of this what you would see as a fruit roll up craft came some ETS that looked like this.

734
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And this is must be a Rudy Garcia drawing excellent drawing.

735
00:49:46,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And so forth this witness TE was really disturbed by this exact operation because he found these ETS and they're kind of emerald blue eyes is so peaceful and kind of pure that he thought what the retrieval teams and shooting down craft were doing was sick.

736
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So he tried to basically defect and leave the retrieval force.

737
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Greer states that this individuals uncle who grandfathered him into the program was the only one who stopped this individual from being killed.

738
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Upon his release TE was targeted with a fake abduction where he was approached by these creatures and basically took brute force to them and found circuitry and so forth within.

739
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So next we'll go to the next witness talked about some of you guys might know this person some of you might not I have actually been trying to get in contact with Shannon Lee for a while.

740
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Shannon Lee is a witness who claimed to I can't 2008 2009 off the coast of I think it was Guam while in the Navy or the Coast Guard participated in a saucer retrieval from the ocean where a craft was almost tangled in the Japanese fisherman's net.

741
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And this was in conjunction with the US Marines.

742
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So again I've been trying to contact this guy for months.

743
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Here's the image of the retrieval operation.

744
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
He actually did an interview with Steven Greer.

745
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I can't remember if it's on the DPI archive or not.

746
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'll actually try to find it and post it but the actual video was taken off of Greer's was taken off of Greer's YouTube page.

747
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And I think this was maybe because I think Mr Lee suffered maybe from some social anxiety or something because the interview was just a little bit awkward.

748
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It was just a little disconjointed and stuff but I've always found this interview extremely interesting because according to Lee this craft was so heavy it almost toppled the Navy craft as it was lifted up in its net.

749
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Greer stated and Shannon Lee states that this artwork right here is a little bit off the craft was had no seams kind of no pathways just a really solid seamless craft and he tried to take a sharp object to it and to no effect.

750
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
To no effect.

751
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So upon returning Shannon Lee was forced to sign numerous NDAs and so forth.

752
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And you guys might know this individual from the disclosure from the National Press Club conference.

753
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
He was very sickly.

754
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He looked it looked really.

755
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't know if it was from his encounter or from just health.

756
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I think he mentioned he had a brain injury but Steven Digna.

757
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:34,000
In his testimony before kind of an abduction case he talks about being on a bombing range where he was with two Raytheon employees where they saw a large boomerang shaped craft.

758
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And I believe one if not both of these craft yes Greer talked about this was a projection.

759
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And here is a little bit where Greer dove into kind of the project blue beam kind of fear mongering stuff he talks about these projection techniques you know if you see a craft over London they can produce numerous craft and kind of fake an invasion and so forth.

760
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:07,000
But this was apparently a Raytheon craft that had entered into the bombing range for clandestine purposes I don't know for whatever purposes it seems strange to do that over an active bombing range and yes.

761
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Steven Digna was suffering a brain injury I wish him peace he looked like he was suffering quite a bit from there.

762
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So Greer stated here as well that anti gravity technology in which this Raytheon craft was based off of was mastered in October of 1954.

763
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Sorry.

764
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Next of course.

765
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Greer talks briefly about Michael.

766
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
We all know Michael from this channel.

767
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
He shows the video made by Star Labs of the octagonal craft.

768
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:48,000
We've all seen these so I'm not going to waste space or so forth but Greer had one new detail about Michael story that I wasn't aware of.

769
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And I'll certainly bring it up to Michael Greer thinks this craft was Lockheed skunk works or EG and G.

770
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Why I don't know exactly why he thinks that.

771
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But that is what Greer states here he doesn't expand on that anymore he just kind of moves on.

772
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Greer states the initial misconceptions of him and thinking this was kind of drug smuggling operations of course I've talked about Michael initially thought when he saw this was drugs.

773
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Greer kind of assumed also Greer has talked to witnesses who state that ARVs are used for smuggling drugs.

774
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
One of these witnesses I think his files were removed from the DPI archive I think it was witnessed.

775
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Sorry let me I'll look this up.

776
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Let me see if I got it right.

777
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yes, 10329 right here in the DPI archive.

778
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I think his files were taken down, but witness 10329 right here.

779
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Worked in deep black projects as knowledge of advanced crafting connections to drug running knows of two sites near Nashville Tennessee where craft have been seen landing.

780
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Same locations were used by the CIA slash 160 if that's an Air Force division locations are private airship and another in a valley between mountains.

781
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So I've talked a little bit to this person I will talk to them again and you know if there's some interesting stories to make.

782
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I will absolutely make them real quick scallions.

783
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I love you.

784
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Thank you so much for your support.

785
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I really really really appreciate it really appreciate it.

786
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah, here kind of with most of these stories guys Greer will talk about the witness will talk about what's going on and then kind of round it back to himself like.

787
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Greer was talking about Michael and then states that after the 2023 NPC that his YouTube was hacked and demonetized and.

788
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:57,000
That just wasn't a necessary addition to me but Greer then talks what I talked about in my interview with Michael that the insider who spoke to Michael was at the NPC 2023 and exact quote from Greer that this insider said to him quote.

789
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That is worse than your Marine guy thinks it is end quote you guys know I like those quote end quote this individual the insider that Michael has spoken to claim to have been part of this operation.

790
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And then.

791
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:26,000
As you'll know this from Michael's testimony Greer starts talking about P3 psionic predisposed I can't remember exactly what pre P3 stands for at the moment my brain is going a mile per minute, but he talks about kind of P3 assets a little bit and if you guys.

792
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Remember this from Michael story and then Ross cult her Ross Colt heart talking about consciousness and so forth.

793
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But these individuals are basically used to interact with with ET craft recovered craft, or I think in some cases as Greer likes to stay kind of lower craft in.

794
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Consciousness technology and P3 operator technology hijacking of ET craft target and bring them down or take control of them.

795
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Greer states that this is a theme. This is a this was a very strange slide to me guys.

796
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I found it strange that Greer brought in hand dominance and preference and individuals into accountability for psy abilities.

797
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I wasn't.

798
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I certainly have never heard that anywhere and I have not heard that I probably won't hear that again.

799
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:35,000
But Greer states that most of these P3 assets these people who are tasked with in kind of interacting with ET craft with their consciousness connection most die.

800
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Those who cannot do the work are used as forced laborers and maintenance in side the facilities and some are now defecting to disclosure project.

801
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I would like to hear a little bit more about that.

802
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And at this time, Greer mentioned a base in the Chihuahua Desert used to house P3s.

803
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:10,000
This is a reference to the sentinels of ethers kind of dops or play written by Michael or ghost written by Michael's insider that he's contacted, which talks about we talked about this all last week 2004.

804
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
What we can now assume is a Lockheed Martin recovery team wiping out a JSOC team.

805
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The differences in sentinels of ether involves trafficking P3 assets in John Stewart source.

806
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It involves tracking it down to craft.

807
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So then Greer went for quite a while on a story about a dream he had when he was around 18 and knew the structures of the cosmos.

808
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
This was about this was a while kind of leading after discussing Michael and P3s.

809
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And this, of course, Greer reiterates that at some unknown time he was approached and offered $2 billion to kind of hush up in defect, not really defect, not really joined black programs, but to stop talking and stop working on the DPA archive.

810
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I think he's discussed this quite a little bit.

811
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Of course, at this time, this is obviously very powerful for Greer.

812
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
He got pretty emotional at this time.

813
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And I can understand that, especially working on such such kind of huge stuff in his life, you spent so much time doing this.

814
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But, you know, I can sometimes I have trouble separating, you know, maybe some of this stuff is sympathy plays for Greer when he talks about himself so much, kind of getting emotional about that.

815
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But who knows who knows.

816
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So at this point we had an intermission, I think it was about 30 minutes.

817
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And when we come back from the break, most things were focused on kind of consciousness and so forth.

818
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So Greer kind of breaks down what he states is the UFO phenomenon it's broke down between ET interdimensional beings and classified black programs usaps and basically human reverse engineer technology.

819
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I'll leave this up for a couple seconds.

820
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But Greer likes to distinguish the fact or distinguish between ET craft and the DPI archive.

821
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
The guy has poured his entire life into this.

822
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

823
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Greer has put decades, decades, decades.

824
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Stubblebind was the one who offered him $2 billion.

825
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Has he said that before?

826
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I might just be messing out actually.

827
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That's interesting.

828
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
For some reason it doesn't.

829
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Is there a link that's not working?

830
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Tell us that.

831
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
If there's a link that's not working.

832
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I thought this was a really interesting here guys.

833
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Look under the classified unacknowledged special access programs you'll see holographic man made beings from thought forms.

834
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Now if you guys know anything about like old, I can't even think to where this practice begins, but topos like a thought forms that manifest conscious beings.

835
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm just, that's a lot.

836
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That's a huge thing to put into a PowerPoint without really expanding on it further, especially saying that Lockheed skunk works essentially manifest topos.

837
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So, yeah, so, yeah, so Greer talks about that both the extraterrestrial and ultra dimensional hypothesis of non human intelligence is through that both of these exist on our planet.

838
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
They're just differentiated.

839
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Most of what we can see as physical craft are in fact ET or ARV alien reproduction vehicles human made and Greer states that the vast majority of sightings of UFO, especially in today's age are actually ARV technology human made technology and not not real kind of ET craft.

840
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:50,000
A lot of the ultra terrestrial stuff is kind of what you hear a little bit more about attached with woo in the phenomena, kind of floating orbs the poltergeist phenomena and so forth.

841
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:06,000
A lot of this talk kind of dove into a little bit more of the kind of woo stuff discussing a lot of physics talk with quantum thrown in here and there to kind of make things sound a little bit more mysterious.

842
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
We referenced the show stranger things as a description of summoning ultra terrestrial beings.

843
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:26,000
This reminds me very closely of Alex Jones claims of of of of individuals high up in clandestine government operations who will take a bunch of DMT and then go talk to spirit programs.

844
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Next, Greer, sorry.

845
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And this time, Greer kind of discuss started to really get into kind of the consciousness aspect of of UAP, a lot of talk about kind of new age concepts like light beings and stuff.

846
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Some of the interesting stuff that Greer discusses is that human programs and abilities are now very close and comparable to what ET technology has.

847
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And this is very interesting to me.

848
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Especially when you think about kind of analyze witness testimony of human made ARVs the possibility they work on electrogroupics like the TR3B and so forth.

849
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I, it's really interesting to think about if human capabilities are near ET and the implications of that are that would mean that human these black programs have unrestricted use of basically surrounding basically unrestricted use of our solar system and other space

850
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
time, what kind of operations are they getting up to and so forth is a very interesting question.

851
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And that Greer likes to state that humans are now an existential threat to ET.

852
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Part of this is because Greer states the technologies ET extraterrestrials use are non local.

853
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:48,000
A lot of these technologies require a craft being or technology to basically remove itself from 3D space time entered folds between dimensional space and pop up elsewhere.

854
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second.

855
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah, the the holographic consciousness universe.

856
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
This stuff at least I know this interests a lot of people.

857
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
That's why of course I'll put it up here.

858
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It's not as big as my focus.

859
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You guys know it's reverse engineering and crash retrieval.

860
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So I might be a little not as knowledgeable on this topic here.

861
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
So if I sound ignorant or I'm just kind of skipping through stuff that you find really interesting.

862
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That's my bad.

863
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm just not as well versed on on such topics quickly Greer really kind of leaned into remote view.

864
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Sorry, wrong tab.

865
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Greer really leaned into remote viewing at this point and went on for a couple minutes about how he himself can levitate.

866
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That was that I think is a bit a bit.

867
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That's a bit of a stretch for me in terms of saying you can levitate and so forth.

868
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I don't really see how that fits into this discussion even when speaking about consciousness and so forth.

869
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:01,000
But we'll keep going because I want to get to Greer had Greer posted what he thinks of as his own Kardashev scale guys.

870
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
So you guys know the Kardashev scale.

871
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It's a ranking of basically civilizations throughout the cosmos.

872
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Humanity is what's known as like a level like 0.7 on the Kardashev scale.

873
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
A level one Kardashev scale is able to harness the entire energy output of its host planet.

874
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
A type two Kardashev scale is able to harness the total energy output of its host son.

875
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And a level three Kardashev civilization is able to harness the entire energy output of its home galaxy.

876
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
There are kind of more expansions on on this and different breakdowns.

877
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But Greer states that current human civilization is consumed by war.

878
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's very primitive environmental technologies and it's plagued by extinction level events.

879
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
A global peaceful civilization.

880
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And I think this is Greer's ultimate goal to leave us lead us towards especially when you look at the lost century.

881
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:56,000
His next video in which he really push is for kind of the the utilization of zero point energy and technologies that have been obfuscated.

882
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And hidden with E.T. reverse engineering.

883
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'm just laughing at Mr. Mosilli's comments were zero.

884
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yeah, that's funny to me.

885
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And a permanent P.I. I think this is a great point by Kai Greer magically assumes that humans are going to magically start loving each other.

886
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And if we know NHI and advanced technology is real, yes, I disagree.

887
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I think he I think a lot of that is he.

888
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Arrest that on claims of like Ronald Reagan and his speech where he says I can't think of how fast humanity would come together if we face like an alien threat and so forth.

889
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I agree.

890
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't think that can be utilized to solely bring humanity together.

891
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:47,000
But a permanent P civilization develops trans dimensional technologies when you read that trans dimensional technologies just know that that's what I discussed when Greer says that a lot of these E.T. technologies are non local that they require the

892
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Utilizer of the technology to basically leave our current space time travel through dimensional folds reengaged another point of space time.

893
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
The pursuit of science and consciousness.

894
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Okay, we can go to but the the weird thing about this guys is Greer only posted to two of four of these slides.

895
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Greer says there's four levels of civilization.

896
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
He only posted two slides.

897
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You can see two of four here.

898
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
He only posted the slide before in this one.

899
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So that was pretty funny to me the level three and interstellar civilization clear to travel to other star systems.

900
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
However, if humans have ability similar to E.T. now, could we not feasibly travel to other star systems as well.

901
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Development of widespread establishment of science of consciousness pursuit of higher states of consciousness early integration into other interstellar civilizations.

902
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I do think the pursuit of consciousness needs to be integrated into a kind of us a level zero current current human civilization as well.

903
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I think consciousness study is a is integral to the human experience, especially how it relates to UAP technology.

904
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That is not something that should be overlooked.

905
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It's still a concept that I'm can be quite unfamiliar with and quite uncomfortable with sometimes.

906
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It's still really new to me concepts like P3 concepts like remote viewing consciousness studies still very new to that subject.

907
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So if I'm ever ignorant towards it, that's why I'm still learning a level four cosmic consciousness civilization above 1% of something.

908
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Senior ambassadors are enlightened in cosmic consciousness contact with other advanced civilizations.

909
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
However, wouldn't a level three interstellar civilization be able to do the same?

910
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But according to this same log, if a cosmic consciousness civilization can provide guidance to emerging civilizations, would a level zero civilization such as humanity not be a emerging civilization?

911
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Or would we need to be a level one or two a global peaceful civilization global peaceful civilization to receive contact and level five part of the senior interstellar collective.

912
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
My question to Greer is where is he getting this information?

913
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
What is he basing this off of?

914
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I would I would really like to know because it's really interesting to me of enlightenment widespread and accelerated experience or innate.

915
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I don't know what that word means.

916
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I'm sorry guys technology parallel states of consciousness.

917
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
So Greer talks about some CE five stuff now.

918
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And he posted a lot of images.

919
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Most were just kind of vague shapes, not much to him.

920
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
He posted two images.

921
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Sorry wrong.

922
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
He posted two images where actual forms can be seen from CE five contact.

923
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I took a special note of right here, but I need to shout out a dude in my discord right when I posted this.

924
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
The same gentleman rectified he posted.

925
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Let me pull this up.

926
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:51,000
This image right here on the right rectified posted that this was actually a sighting in Twitter in in Chile, sitting on Twitter in Chile.

927
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And as far as rectified knows, Greer is not associated with this sighting at all.

928
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,000
So why why post this if it's not yours, man?

929
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Most of Greer's photos you can see a lot of CE five stuff on the DPI archive.

930
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
The vast majority of them are lights in the sky.

931
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I'm totally not.

932
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm not totally closed off to CE five.

933
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I just haven't seen evidence for it, you know, especially when it comes to the images.

934
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
It's just sort of really vague light forms.

935
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So of course, there's there's not much I can kind of study off of that.

936
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But I'd like to see more.

937
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So interesting to me, I'm sure you guys have all heard of a lot of the stuff that Jason Sands has been talking about that.

938
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:48,000
John Ramirez talked about that Lou has talked about that that Jeremy Corbell and George not kind of like to dangle in front of you a date, a deadline, right?

939
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
When I say that most people probably think of 2027 as a sort of deadline.

940
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I think it's associated with Jason Sands.

941
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:03,000
He overheard he states he overheard communications between NHI and humans or NHI and NHI saying they want their stuff back.

942
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Greer made specific mention of the timeframe 2025 to 2030.

943
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Quote, if we haven't corrected this problem, it will be corrected for us.

944
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Greer states this is the worst case scenario that our mastery of ET technologies are a threat due to the fact these are non local technologies are harnessing and misuse of these technologies are affecting other solar systems.

945
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And fixing this thing for us would be a correction to protect other worlds, life on earth and life elsewhere.

946
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And that statement is kind of where Greer left the event.

947
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Of course, then there was an ovation and everybody clapped and left.

948
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So that was the that was the entire Greer catalog of his show today in London.

949
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And now that that's over, we can go through kind of if you have questions about the event questions about anything, let's go through them.

950
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
We'll talk about the whole thing.

951
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,000
If there's anything that stood out to you, we'll go through one by one and you guys know how I do.

952
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
If there's any question, I will absolutely answer it.

953
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So we'll start going through those.

954
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Whoa, this is really over lit.

955
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
How about that?

956
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's really over lit.

957
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Sorry about that, guys.

958
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I don't know if that's better.

959
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
So let's see.

960
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'm going to leave it on.

961
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
The main issue with Greer is he does not distinguish between what he knows due to evidence and what he is speculating on.

962
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
He's pretty much in his own category among UAP sources.

963
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah, I think it's crucial to for people when they're speculating to make sure that it's clear that they're speculating.

964
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I think this is what got like Jason Sands and a bit of trouble out the gate because he would just kind of ramble on about scenarios and ideas

965
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and wouldn't really kind of nail down and specify when he's saying, hey, I'm speculating.

966
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't know this for sure.

967
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I think with a lot of these witnesses in Greer's archive, I'm not sure to the extent to which he has vetted every single one of these sources.

968
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
So when he claims he has 762 whistleblowers, this is pretty much every name redacted or unredacted on the log.

969
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
A lot of these names that he states are under whistleblower protection.

970
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
A lot of these are labeled as like UFO researchers.

971
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
For example, you guys know I'm working on the Kexpert case.

972
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Stan Gordon is listed in there as a UFO researcher in point of contact to Kexpert witnesses.

973
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Does he need to be offered?

974
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
If you guys don't know Stan Gordon, he was the primary Kexpert researcher.

975
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Did he need to be offered whistleblower protection?

976
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:43,000
There's also a lot of the I feel like with the witness list and the facilities map.

977
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Greer was happy to beef up the content over quality of the content, right?

978
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I bet you can see what I'm saying.

979
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:58,000
For each email he received, somebody making claims, it's easy to redact the email, redact the name, throw it on the DPI archive to say, hey, here's another witness.

980
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Look what they're saying now and so forth.

981
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Hey, Flying Lotus, what's up dude?

982
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Flying Lotus, if you guys don't know his music, Flying Lotus is awesome.

983
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I recommend checking out the Black Balloon reprise with Denzel Curry and Never Catch Me with Kendrick Lamar.

984
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Flying Lotus is great.

985
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
What do I think about Richard Doty?

986
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't think he can be trusted.

987
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I think anything that Doty kind of connects his name to, it's almost impossible to get to the bottom of.

988
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:36,000
All you have to do is look at Tobinowitz and his claims in a career's documentary Unacknowledged where he talks about the, I think it's the Roswell, yeah, the Roswell incident being some Russian dwarves,

989
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
disfigured Russian dwarves and so forth.

990
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:46,000
So I tend to stay away from Doty as much as I possibly can.

991
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
What are your thoughts on Sans?

992
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Truthfully, I don't buy it at all, but would like to get your thoughts.

993
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm remaining agnostic to Sans until I get a chance to kind of speak to him direct.

994
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I know a lot of people, not a lot, I'd say I know about six people in the intelligence community and all of them, while they can't verify Sans' claims,

995
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
they all speak very highly of him as an individual.

996
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
So I find that interesting.

997
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Now, all these people that speak highly of him as an individual agree that the method in which he came forward was awful.

998
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You know, on Twitter spaces and to just engage with a lot of the Twitter drama and so forth.

999
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And I've heard that that's just kind of the type of guy Sans is.

1000
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
He just wants to get that information out there.

1001
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
He's got a great and kind heart.

1002
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
He knows him directly, speaks incredibly highly of him.

1003
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
So if I get a chance to speak to him, I'd like to.

1004
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Until then, I'll probably just remain a little agnostic towards his case.

1005
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I do not trust Greer.

1006
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
He's a shifty.

1007
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I'll say it just like I've said a thousand times.

1008
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Greer has brought forth so much great witnesses and documents and stuff to study.

1009
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And then disclosure briefing document from 2001.

1010
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I will swear by it is the best piece of literature.

1011
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
If one of the best pieces of literature on the UFO subject.

1012
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Now, I agree with what Kai said earlier that Greer tries to make himself the center of everything.

1013
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
This was further enforced by Greer talking just inserting himself into everything.

1014
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I forgot when he was talking about Michael.

1015
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:20,000
He was saying that how he like worked out with Michael and how big Michael was and how much it made him soar to work out with Michael.

1016
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And it's, you know, it's, you know, why do you need to keep talking about yourself with all of that?

1017
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,000
He likes to make himself the centerpiece of everything, but he has done great, great work.

1018
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Thanks for the shout out.

1019
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm just following your leads and focusing on the approval.

1020
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

1021
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:48,000
There's just there's a ton of fluff and euphology and I know myself I have gotten caught going down some rabbit holes that lead nowhere and done some dead end work or work that I later found out is kind of just not much to it.

1022
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
But just kind of focus on what you can.

1023
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I like how this channel attracts both people capable and willing to actually think and share lunatics.

1024
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I don't, I don't know.

1025
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I think everybody here is pretty, pretty crafty, pretty smart.

1026
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I don't think I know of any lunatics in this chat.

1027
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Everybody is pretty brilliant, especially as we saw last week, man.

1028
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Everybody, everybody has something to say something to add.

1029
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I'd love every single person in here.

1030
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Implementing closed loop processes.

1031
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Oh, I think I'm stumbling upon a conversation in the chat here.

1032
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
You guys keep going and I'll get the summary at the end.

1033
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Definitely has hundreds of USAP whistleblowers in there.

1034
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Correct.

1035
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
A lot, trust me as I've spent an uncomfortable amount of time pouring through the UFO witnesses list.

1036
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And I plan to make multiple more videos on hold on.

1037
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Let me actually ask you a question.

1038
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:54,000
There are a lot of sources that I want to cover in the redacted files that I have some interesting information on.

1039
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Even if I can't talk to these people, because there are some others who I've identified who I'm trying to talk to.

1040
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Even if I can't talk about them, do you guys still want me to cover them?

1041
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Or is that kind of like a not as interesting?

1042
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:14,000
There's like a seven to 10 other people I would like to cover, but I've been hesitant to do so unless I have spoken to them.

1043
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,000
But if you guys still want to see that, even just kind of my research on there, I would gladly do that as well.

1044
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Gladly.

1045
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I appreciate it, Myer, that you speak your mind.

1046
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
That's the martial artist and you thank you very much.

1047
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I got to be careful speaking my mind.

1048
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I think just because I have a platform where I make videos, it's just important to kind of say when I don't know something.

1049
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I'll speak my mind, but then I'll say if it's got some nonsense in there, then I'll say it.

1050
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Have you heard about the big homie sea?

1051
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yeah, let me let me grab a quick drink of water.

1052
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I'll do it away from the mic so I don't sound like a slurper in the mic.

1053
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I have.

1054
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I find it interesting, but I'm there's not much for me to investigate there, but it is interesting.

1055
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Doty's sauce.

1056
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I was surprised to make connections to lose book.

1057
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Doty is very stuff.

1058
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Sorry.

1059
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
You should research the connection between DMT and NHI.

1060
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I forgot the name of the researcher who wrote that book, but he was working with John Mack.

1061
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
That's not the work of no, that's not Terrence McKenna.

1062
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
He worked with psilocybin.

1063
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Right.

1064
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I actually would like to pursue that more.

1065
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I think it's very interesting because there's there's the claims of like Alex Jones of DMT and NHI, but then there's a lot more grounded research.

1066
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So I would like to go down that rabbit hole.

1067
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You staff disinformation agent.

1068
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I think Doty was AFSOI, right?

1069
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Maybe I targeted Benowitz.

1070
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Yes.

1071
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Crazy committed suicide.

1072
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Yes.

1073
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
These are all great points for anybody kind of looking into Doty.

1074
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Why all the hate on Greer?

1075
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I think people just have very hot and cold opinions on Greer.

1076
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I don't think that as that's much hate as it is people being rightfully critical of Greer.

1077
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Now, people are often very critical of Greer and I support that, but I also preach time and time again.

1078
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's also important to give Greer credit where credit is due because Greer has done incredible work in the field of ufology would not be where it is today without Greer.

1079
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Absolutely not.

1080
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Hey, Towney 3057.

1081
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Thank you for the Australian 30 bucks.

1082
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I really appreciate that, man.

1083
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Thank you so much for tuning in.

1084
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Thank you very much.

1085
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Other than personal opinions, what's the deal about Greer?

1086
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:40,000
This is just kind of what we discussed earlier that with a lot of witnesses, he will kind of make their story his own as kind of I saw firsthand and kind of make himself the center of everything in his event today.

1087
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:52,000
He practices terrible operational security stating that he cares for the sanctity of whistleblowers and their anonymity, but he violates OPSEC horrifically in the worst way I have ever seen with TV.

1088
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I grappled with even publishing that his account for so long with TV because I knew that anybody could just hop on the DPI archive and find a name associated with it within seconds.

1089
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But Greer violates OPSEC and I just don't think he does enough work to vet all of the people who contact him.

1090
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I think anybody who kind of contacts him, if there's a story there, he just throws it into the witness list, right?

1091
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Because there's in the witness list, I think it's just stuff for quantity over quality because there's so many names in that that are just like point of contact to other witnesses.

1092
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And that stuff should just be used for internal use, right?

1093
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Like there's no need for the average researcher like me to get any value out of witness.

1094
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
This isn't an actual number, but 11067 who is a point of contact to other points of contact.

1095
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
There's nothing of value there.

1096
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Flying Lotus, thank you so much, dude.

1097
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I appreciate that.

1098
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I think coming up Flying Lotus and I are going to play some Black Ops as it comes out.

1099
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,000
If anybody else wants to play some Black Ops with us, we'll do it in the Discord and that should be a ton of fun.

1100
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
A ton of fun.

1101
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Faking CE5 stuff, I've seen nothing about the CE5, so I really don't kind of know anything about that.

1102
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:07,000
But I do struggle with the images he posts that are supposedly CE5 stuff.

1103
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It's just kind of lights.

1104
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And as we saw with the saucer photo that was taken from a Chile case that as far as we know, Greer is not associated with that case.

1105
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And again, I just want to say this again.

1106
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I know I'm being very critical of Greer, but I could also spend an equal amount of time celebrating the great work he's done.

1107
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm just going to shout out again the interview he did with Jonathan Wagan, which is a wonderful piece.

1108
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
And you can read the actual written description in the DPI archive.

1109
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:43,000
In the 2001 disclosure briefing document, he also provides his estimate on the Black Operation situation in terms of how this program operates quasi-nationally,

1110
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:54,000
basically performs off the books, has almost mastered extraterrestrial technology, commands ARVs and so forth.

1111
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Excellent piece.

1112
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I do need to state that Greer did in fact, maybe it's not necessarily a brief, but did speak to Admiral Thomas Wilson amongst others about UFOs in 97.

1113
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That is true.

1114
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
That dude, you are that dude telekinesis beats.

1115
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Thank you very much.

1116
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Philip Corso is the smoking gun.

1117
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Philip Corso is excellent.

1118
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I have talked to an individual who the same they know some like inside stuff and corporations and they have recommended Corso, a lot of Corso's work.

1119
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
So that's really interesting.

1120
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Greer has helped to further bring attention to UAP UFO, USO.

1121
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So in some aspects, he did some good for the topic, but it's a double edged sword.

1122
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So he's kept some that agreed.

1123
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I think that's a really good way to put a double edged sword with the bad with with the bad with Greer.

1124
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I'm going to start dosing in some of the good with Greer because even though a lot of today, today with the with the what's it called his event.

1125
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I know I've I harped on a lot of points saying like old Greer stuffed himself into here, but still all of this work is is out of decades, decades of labor, decades will be Milo.

1126
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I love you as well.

1127
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Thank you very much.

1128
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I guess we'll know moving forward who's full of crap and who isn't.

1129
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I very much hope so.

1130
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I absolutely hope so.

1131
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Any thoughts on Tim Ventura and friends?

1132
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Why do I know that name?

1133
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You guys are going to roast me for not knowing Tim Ventura off the top of my head.

1134
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Somebody remind me and I will remember.

1135
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I will absolutely remember.

1136
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Do I have plans to collaborate with any other UFO related YouTube channels night shift invented?

1137
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I'm asking as they've shown keen interest in talking to you.

1138
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
No, that's not that's not so much my thing.

1139
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Collabs, Jesse Michaels and John Michael Gaudier.

1140
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Those are those are some collabs.

1141
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I'll be doing and I will be seeing Jesse Michaels this week.

1142
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And I can't wait for that because he just interviewed Lou and I can't wait to speak to him about that.

1143
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
That's going to be great.

1144
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Grubbs equals goat.

1145
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Thank you.

1146
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You are goat.

1147
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You are the goat Django.

1148
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
What do you think about Harold Malmgren and former personal dental advisor Malmgren is extremely interesting.

1149
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And so is his daughter.

1150
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And I would like to speak to his daughter as she has made some excellent claims as well.

1151
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Excellent, excellent claims.

1152
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
What do you think about blood?

1153
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So we discussed this last time I've remained similar to sans pretty agnostic to blood.

1154
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So I don't want to put forward an opinion on anything unless I have a kind of well versed research.

1155
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So I'll sit down, read some books about blood.

1156
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So watch some interviews and so forth.

1157
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And then I will form an opinion because I don't I don't want to just talk out of my behind.

1158
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I want your view on your research as opposed to your view on others.

1159
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I hope that's clear.

1160
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
A lot of people do great research here.

1161
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I think that I just like to model my research a little bit more on like the old school researcher like the Dolan or the string field.

1162
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I find power in the written word and I try to create something that would be a written word and translated into a video.

1163
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I like the chasing down leads.

1164
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I like I like a little this is the way to do.

1165
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I like a little less news of the day type stuff and a little more long research into a topic.

1166
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
That's just kind of how I like to do things.

1167
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I know everybody has their preference.

1168
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I know everybody has a preference.

1169
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Okay, let's go.

1170
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Don't don't you think it's weird that Rogan is suddenly super skeptical about all this?

1171
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I mean, from having a UAP in Lazare to not believe it anymore.

1172
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Why didn't Lou talk about his book?

1173
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Lou didn't talk about his book because Lou didn't want to sell his book on the podcast, which I very respect.

1174
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
You might have to just talk about the phenomenon.

1175
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:29,000
It's interesting how whenever there's a UAP related guy on Joe Rogan, Mike Baker, the CIA, former CIA guy is right there to clean it up.

1176
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I think Baker has 14 appearances on Jerry.

1177
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It's also really interesting to see Joe's.

1178
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I think Joe just likes to believe kind of what's in the cool conspiracy, right?

1179
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Because when he was really into UFOs, this was like 20 early or mid 2010s when the subject wasn't as popular as it was.

1180
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
There wasn't as much serious research.

1181
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And he just kind of liked that it was more of a conspiracy.

1182
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
In a way, I think he's a little bit more of a calm Eddie Bravo.

1183
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And we love Eddie Bravo.

1184
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Joe Rogan's episodes with Eddie Bravo and Alex Jones are some of the best entertainment you will ever see ever.

1185
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Speaking, your mind is potentially going to cost you.

1186
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Are you scared even a little?

1187
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:16,000
No, I mean, I've probably crossed some toes, but it's all good.

1188
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Rick Strassman, where have I heard that name before Lotus?

1189
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Where have I heard that name?

1190
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I've heard of Freedward Winterberg.

1191
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
That name rings a bell, but I can't reference it off the top of my head.

1192
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I have come across the names Falcon and Condor.

1193
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I think this was actually a career witness in 1980s in reference to like a blue team as well.

1194
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I have to find those files, but yes, I have.

1195
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Greer presents himself in a polarizing way, but if he's right even 10% of the time, then he's a valuable addition.

1196
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Yes, absolutely.

1197
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:01,000
That's why everything that Greer puts out, I think needs to be researched independently from everything else and studied.

1198
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
People mainly criticize Greer because of CE5 and how he monetized it while appearing to provide no evidence that it works.

1199
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I think so.

1200
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I think that's a good point because a lot of the CE5 stuff is really pricey.

1201
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I think in my Discord, I did kind of like an event revenue of this event that he did today just to kind of get a ballpark picture.

1202
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I think the place in which he spoke in London housed like 800 people and we'll just say that it was at full capacity.

1203
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Between tickets in there are $75 and then webinar tickets and stuff.

1204
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I think it was like a gross of $45,000 and this wasn't counting the 1,500 to sit and have dinner with Greer.

1205
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I just think he pushes the monetary incentive pretty heavy because he especially asks for donations and stuff for DPI archives.

1206
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I think he just really pushes that.

1207
01:28:51,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm not too well versed in psychedelics so I don't know how much I can answer there.

1208
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Greer just in terms of the impact is made.

1209
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's up there with Jacques Villiers and Jean Mack and those figures he is.

1210
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Greer is on the Mount Rushmore of UFO researchers and I will say that.

1211
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Has Greer said anything recently about Lou Elizondo?

1212
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I think Greer is critical of Lou Elizondo and I'm trying to remember that right now, but I do think that.

1213
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I do think Greer is a charlatan.

1214
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I can understand why you think so.

1215
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
There is a disinformation campaign to ruin Greer's name, especially on Twitter.

1216
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I wouldn't be surprised, but I think Greer is one of those guys that they can just kind of let go and do his own thing because as you see in the comments, Greer is so polarizing.

1217
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Everybody is so polarized about Greer.

1218
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So many people think he might be a charlatan, so many people respect him, and so many people are in between.

1219
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So I think Greer does that himself, to be honest.

1220
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
What are your thoughts on Rogan?

1221
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Isn't it sus, suddenly a skeptic anymore?

1222
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Yes, absolutely.

1223
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I find it weird to think about when he had guests like Travis Walton on and Bob.

1224
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I stay away from talking about Bob.

1225
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I've said this before because I want so badly to believe Bob.

1226
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I can't really look at his case with a critical analysis because if I see the discrepancies in education, I'll just try and explain it the way as best as I can.

1227
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
But Joe is so, so easy on Bob, especially when Bob had migraines when he couldn't answer a question.

1228
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But Joe, when he spoke to Grosh in particular, I know because I've watched that interview like 50 times, was extremely harsh and not a very gracious host, in my opinion.

1229
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Greer has beef with Elizondo.

1230
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yes.

1231
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Sorry for repeating the question.

1232
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It didn't come through before.

1233
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I wanted to ask what made you consider the phenomenon being real?

1234
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
For me, it was the Nimitz incident since I am into jets.

1235
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
That's a good one.

1236
01:30:50,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I think that, I don't know if there was one specific incident that made me just say, Holy cow, the phenomenon is real just because I've been studying this since I was just so young.

1237
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:16,000
In my mind, just with all the encounters I read about, especially when I was young, I was really into air force sightings and dog, not dog fights with craft, but like military sightings because I was so into military jets and UFOs.

1238
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I've just always been like the back of my head until I reached an older age, just kind of had to assume there was validity to this and so forth.

1239
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
So I don't think there, I would like to hear from you guys, what was your like shining moment that made you say, Holy cow, this is real.

1240
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I'd like to hear that from you guys.

1241
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Rogan, Mike Baker, every time you talk, yeah, that's really funny.

1242
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Lou said a prominent member of the disclosure movement is disinfo.

1243
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
He was probably referring to Greer.

1244
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah, that was on a Sean Ryan, right?

1245
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
No, that was Timber Shet, I think it was on the Sean Ryan show.

1246
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,000
He referred to, maybe I'm thinking of a different incident, but Timber Shet says something similar.

1247
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I feel like you should do a video on DMT research in NHI as some people see entities on doing DMT.

1248
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
That'd be fun.

1249
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I'd like that, but I will have to do a lot of research because I know very, very, very little about, I know very little about psychedelics, very little.

1250
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I really think we should, yeah, I'm just not well versed.

1251
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
People like to crap on Greer for the sake of saying something.

1252
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
They don't bother doing the research and go very deep on it.

1253
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
ARV, Psychotronics, EMWs, DEWS, MKUltra, et cetera.

1254
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I completely agree.

1255
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,000
A lot of the way Greer phrases stuff is very outlandish and standoffish.

1256
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So even stuff like P3 and Consciousness Connection Greer has been talking about for a while.

1257
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And I fell into the pitfall you're talking about, about kind of brushing that stuff golf because I thought it was a little too far fetched for me to pay attention to until I really started kind of sitting back and thinking about things.

1258
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Have you ever done any videos on June Crane?

1259
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I have not, but that would be interesting.

1260
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Did you read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman?

1261
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I didn't read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman, but I have read about the Corona crash and talked about it with Ryan Wood.

1262
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And I think Wood as well as, I think James Rigney, the guy who leaked the Wilson Davis documents, thinks that some details of Roswell are kind of mixed in with other crashes around the same time.

1263
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And one of those is Corona and so forth.

1264
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
What's your take on Rogan recently?

1265
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I think you got warned by Feds to stop talking too much.

1266
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I want to be surprised.

1267
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I used to be a big Joe Rogan listener, but I feel like the quality of guests have died off and the talking points aren't nearly as interesting to me.

1268
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
What have you heard of Harry Drew and do you think he is honest?

1269
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
That is very interesting.

1270
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I have, I spoke about Harry Drew and the Kingman Crash very recently.

1271
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,000
A certain, I'm not going to say their name just because I don't know if they want to kind of talk about that they're working on this.

1272
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:53,000
But an interesting channel and myself were trying to track down Harry Drew's documentary about what he had a documentary about Kingman.

1273
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And we've been trying to track that down right now.

1274
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It's only been really a DVD that was sold with his book on Kingman.

1275
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I can't remember what it's called right now.

1276
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Like the fifth day in May or something like that.

1277
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm trying to remember what it's called.

1278
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
But yeah, Harry Drew is the person that proposed that there were three Kingman crashes.

1279
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
The first was a controlled descent.

1280
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:18,000
The second or first was a controlled descent and the second two were crashes, two of which contained bodies as well.

1281
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And this occurred over in late May, 1953.

1282
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Harry Drew is really interesting.

1283
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I need to track down that dang documentary.

1284
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Ross Campbell says Kingman is extremely important.

1285
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I agree.

1286
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I think it's crucial to track down that dang documentary and continue to study.

1287
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I like to think back to the Chris Mellon signal exchange.

1288
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:45,000
He released with a USG individual who talked about an SES gatekeeper in the Air Force and Kingman.

1289
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Joe got warned big time.

1290
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I think it's very possible.

1291
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I'm sorry.

1292
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I'm trying to keep up with everything.

1293
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
If we talk about something, then like five minutes later, I get to the comment.

1294
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I'm sorry about that, guys.

1295
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Mike Baker talks for hours and says nothing.

1296
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
He does.

1297
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I remember back in like 2017, I saw a Mike Baker episode and I said, Holy cow.

1298
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
What's it going to be?

1299
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,000
And this guy just jabbers, jabbers, jabbers, jabbers on with, with not much interesting

1300
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
to say.

1301
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I dig Greer's view on drones versus UAP.

1302
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I have a feeling he's on to something.

1303
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
The KMO drones jellyfish is a big retriever for DoD.

1304
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Yeah.

1305
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I found more and more.

1306
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I've warmed up to the idea that there's a more of a mix of ARV versus UAP according to Greer.

1307
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Bradley, what's up?

1308
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
You have missed quite a lot and I would recommend starting from the beginning because we talked

1309
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
about Greer's entire presentation today.

1310
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Rick Strasman.

1311
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I know Rick.

1312
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Okay.

1313
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Yes.

1314
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Okay.

1315
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I will read that.

1316
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I will read that.

1317
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
That sounds really interesting.

1318
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I think Rogan might still believe.

1319
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yeah.

1320
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Yeah.

1321
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Probably with that with how big Rogan is, he probably is just bombarded with so much as

1322
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
well.

1323
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So much.

1324
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,500
Maybe people who are just claiming to have sightings and so forth that he just is a little

1325
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:01,500
bit jaded to the topic, which is crazy to me if he is jaded to the topic because he'll

1326
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:06,500
have guys like Lou and Grush on and kind of treat them not as pleasantly as I would have

1327
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,500
thought.

1328
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,500
Are you familiar with the alleged crash of a man made triangular ARV in East Germany?

1329
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,500
Was that in?

1330
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:15,500
Let me get out a copy of Magic Eyes Only.

1331
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,500
What year was that in?

1332
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,500
Sorry.

1333
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,500
I dropped my water bottle.

1334
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,500
I need to find out what year that was in.

1335
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:34,500
I want to say 80s, maybe earlier, but I do remember that case.

1336
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,500
Okay.

1337
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,500
Kai, I will look for you because I have heard of that case.

1338
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,500
You're saying it was Mark McCandlish.

1339
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,500
He talked about it.

1340
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,500
Was that when he talked?

1341
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Okay.

1342
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,500
Let me see.

1343
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,500
I know I've heard about that.

1344
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,500
I'm just having trouble referencing.

1345
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,500
I appreciate the piece on Michael.

1346
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,500
He will be anointed hero.

1347
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,500
I hope so.

1348
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:54,500
I would very much like for Michael to be able to speak a little more.

1349
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,500
Very much like that.

1350
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,500
I appreciate Lou for being humble that he doesn't mention his book out late,

1351
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,500
despite essentially living in an ARV with his wife facing economic hardship.

1352
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:04,500
Since speaking out about UAP, UFO, USO, et cetera.

1353
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,500
Yeah.

1354
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,500
Whatever your view is on Lou, it is respectful that especially on JR,

1355
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,500
he doesn't mention his book once.

1356
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,500
Once.

1357
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,500
Falcon and Condor.

1358
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:12,500
Yeah.

1359
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,500
Aviary codenames.

1360
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,500
Rick Dodie is one of them.

1361
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,500
I think John B. Alexander is another.

1362
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,500
Oh, and this was a witness.

1363
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,500
A H A H in the Greer archive.

1364
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,500
I can't remember exactly what name it is.

1365
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,500
Slimy Toad made me fart real bad.

1366
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,500
Well, maybe you shouldn't take Slimy Toad, brother.

1367
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:37,500
Seriousness aside, Greer looks like a reptilian wearing a human meat suit.

1368
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,500
I hope he's not a secret reptilian.

1369
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:43,500
Is there a chance the government actually works together on this behind the curtains?

1370
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,500
Why?

1371
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,500
Yes.

1372
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Five eyes to a degree.

1373
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,500
Five eyes nations.

1374
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:52,500
US, UK, New Zealand, Australia and Canada work together on this.

1375
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:57,500
You can look at a 2023 memo from Canadian politician Larry McGuire to the Canadian

1376
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:01,500
Minister of Defense that speaks about being more transparent about five eyes

1377
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
working together with UAP.

1378
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:08,500
If you listen to the UK whistle or sorry, the infographics whistleblower I covered

1379
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,500
and you take that testimony as a real testimony or just somebody giving a real

1380
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:15,500
testimony, you remember that Europe and many countries in Europe have been a default

1381
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:20,500
agreement with the US that the US gets ownership of those technologies.

1382
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,500
Really respect your view on Greer.

1383
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,500
Obviously you have issues with him, but you don't turn a blind eye to his data.

1384
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,500
Absolutely not.

1385
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:31,500
The DPI archive has been a true gift, a true gift.

1386
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,500
I have tried Greer CE5 protocols myself at home.

1387
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,500
It worked.

1388
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,500
Objects legit started appearing, disappearing, flashing, interacting with my thoughts.

1389
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,500
I would like to hear more at what elevation did they appear?

1390
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,500
Were they just light sources?

1391
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,500
Could you make out like a tangible craft design?

1392
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,500
Tell us more.

1393
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,500
I think that's very interesting.

1394
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,500
Very interesting.

1395
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Tim Ventura works at all propulsion, APEC works with Mark Sockle, Charles Bueller, Drew

1396
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,500
Arajima.

1397
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:02,500
Yes, I have heard of this, heard of him, but I've never really dove into any of his

1398
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,500
work.

1399
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,500
Sorry.

1400
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:09,500
How many whistleblowers do you think will appear at the next UAP hearing?

1401
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:14,500
Probably right now, I don't have very high hopes for many.

1402
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:18,500
I think the 2023 congressional hearings, there were supposed to be two additional

1403
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,500
whistleblowers that didn't show up.

1404
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:27,500
I would hope more, but with whistleblower protection right now in terms of not safeguarding

1405
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:32,500
people's pensions, I don't know how many people want to do that.

1406
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:35,500
There are too many people who focus on the people more than the content.

1407
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,500
Yes.

1408
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,500
I 100% agree.

1409
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,500
Well put.

1410
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:43,500
Falcon was, yes, I believe it was, I believe Falcon was Richard Dodie.

1411
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,500
Wow, we're just getting to the Grush and JR Retalk.

1412
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,500
Yeah, he was standoffish with Grush.

1413
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:55,500
Joe was kind of just like really laissez-faire with that, kind of relaxed and taken very

1414
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:56,500
seriously.

1415
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,500
Rogan Krabs on Grush and Lou behind their backs, but he blindly defends Lazare.

1416
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,500
Yeah, it seems like he has a big problem with Grush and then the TTSA crowd.

1417
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,500
The releasing is not right wing.

1418
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:11,500
You asked politics is a mess, a mess.

1419
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,500
Your video on the private sector should be required viewing for anyone in the community

1420
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,500
and any conspiracy communities.

1421
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,500
This is so big.

1422
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,500
I appreciate that.

1423
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,500
Thank you.

1424
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:25,500
Are you talking Battelle, Lockheed or SAIC?

1425
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:29,500
Timbershed recently said that next hearings will likely primarily consist of scientists

1426
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,500
and more pilots.

1427
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,500
Yeah.

1428
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:36,500
As much as I enjoy hearing about Ryan Graves, we need firsthand testimony of the people

1429
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:41,500
that Greer says he's talking to about people who have actually retrieved craft, like he

1430
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:44,500
said, who flew him over the Hellendale plant.

1431
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,500
Rogan is being led by gatekeepers.

1432
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,500
I wouldn't be surprised.

1433
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,500
We should deep dive CEO of these companies with special access programs.

1434
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,500
I bet something surfaces.

1435
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,500
Someone was, but oh, that reminds me.

1436
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:59,500
Greer said his uncle was the Grumman in Northrop Grumman, but that he had no knowledge of

1437
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,500
UAP situations.

1438
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:04,500
I would like to look into CEOs, as well as some head-up scientists.

1439
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:09,500
We talked about this last week, but Lockheed Martin and Jim Ryder, as mentioned in Lou

1440
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,500
Elizondo's book, Eminent.

1441
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,500
I think there's a lot of interesting people we could study.

1442
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:18,500
As well as looking at board of directors of companies and their previous relationships

1443
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:22,500
in terms of work on the CIA, because you have Ronald Moultrie, who's on the board of directors

1444
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,500
for the Carlisle Group.

1445
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,500
He was a big with Sean Kirkpatrick and so forth.

1446
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,500
There's a lot of great connections.

1447
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,500
For me, it was Mark McCandless.

1448
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:31,500
I see what you're saying.

1449
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,500
Mark McCandless broke that ground for you.

1450
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,500
Mark McCandless's story is excellent.

1451
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:42,500
I really want to cover it in full detail and give it the true justice it deserves.

1452
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,500
David Fraber got me started after that.

1453
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,500
The testimonies are just impossible to know, both in quality and quantity.

1454
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,500
Everything else seems like rumors to me, but I still find them interesting.

1455
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,500
I remember when the Tic Tac case, when Fraber really started talking about his experience

1456
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:59,500
on Joe Rogan and so forth, that felt monumental.

1457
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:03,500
Real when David Grush came forward and I started researching and here I am.

1458
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:09,500
If you were led here by Grush, I couldn't think of anything better.

1459
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,500
Shining Moment was actually Bob Lazar interview with Rogan.

1460
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:15,500
I believe everywhere he says from there, I started exploring rabbit holes.

1461
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,500
Interesting.

1462
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,500
Bob Lazar is, of course, so contentious.

1463
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:24,500
I love, I could talk about Bob all dang day, all day.

1464
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:25,500
Okay.

1465
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Flying Lotus, if you're still here, is Brainfeeder taking fall interns?

1466
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:33,500
I can also text him about that.

1467
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,500
I know, I will text him about that.

1468
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:39,500
I didn't even know this stuff was going on until I saw the Nimitz incident,

1469
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:42,500
which Nimitz incident would lead me to the hearing, which made me realize that

1470
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
an experience I had was 100% of UAP.

1471
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,500
Tell me about it.

1472
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,500
That's really interesting.

1473
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,500
You can either tell me about it here in the Discord because I would really like to hear

1474
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,500
that.

1475
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,500
McKinnon, let's just filmmaker was poisoned.

1476
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,500
I forgot.

1477
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,500
Yeah.

1478
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,500
Greer said in this, sorry, I'll probably have details about the event come to me.

1479
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:59,500
Greer stated that four people he has worked with have been killed.

1480
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,500
I have not seen evidence for that, but he did state that.

1481
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,500
He did state that.

1482
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,500
I was attacked by a Translucent Bean when I was 19 or 20.

1483
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,500
I was in between sleep and awake and it wasn't a dream.

1484
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,500
It was like a tentacle pearl Translucent Bean.

1485
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,500
That sounds horrifying.

1486
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:14,500
Horrifying.

1487
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,500
That sounds very scary.

1488
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:23,500
Like in a hypnagogic state almost.

1489
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,500
Respect your comment on old school research first news of the day.

1490
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,500
I'm just an old school guy.

1491
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,500
That's why I like wrestling with people and studying UFOs.

1492
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,500
Greer is way ahead of Congress.

1493
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,500
Even he is another level.

1494
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:39,500
Greer is way, way ahead of Congress.

1495
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,500
Even he is another level research.

1496
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,500
Him.

1497
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,500
He's.

1498
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
I agree with you, Alan.

1499
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,500
I don't know what you're saying, but I agree.

1500
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,500
I met Greer's first time doing DMT.

1501
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,500
It was expecting machine elves and fractals.

1502
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,500
It was more real than real.

1503
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:57,500
I don't know anything about UFO and Greer lore prior.

1504
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,500
Now, after getting involved in UFO lore,

1505
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:05,500
would you say these Greys that you saw are kind of like the classic depiction of Greys?

1506
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,500
Me and the homies are all a girl build.

1507
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,500
I hope everybody is, man.

1508
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,500
How do I get in contact with these whistleblowers?

1509
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:15,500
I would definitely like to do a video of myself on some of these people.

1510
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
Is it because of your following?

1511
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,500
Not likely.

1512
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,500
For how I got in contact with Michael, for example, you guys know this.

1513
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,500
I first got in contact with Joey.

1514
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,500
Any of the people I've covered, like MSTB,

1515
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:34,500
I have gone really far out of my way to contact these people.

1516
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:41,500
Discerning the names on the DPI archive has taken anywhere from five minutes with TB to a week

1517
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,500
to try to find these names.

1518
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
Then, of course, it involves contacting these people,

1519
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
seeing if they'll be willing to talk.

1520
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:53,500
I can't tell you how. I have a dozen people who have told me no, not interested.

1521
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:56,500
I mean, the name is listed in the archive.

1522
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,500
I'm going to double check the archive because I don't want to burn the name if it's not there.

1523
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:04,500
But there was a doctor that Greer stated had a UAP encounter on a ship,

1524
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:10,500
on a Navy ship who a UAP came out of the water,

1525
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:16,500
landed nearby and basically destroyed some of the local surroundings just with its landing.

1526
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:21,500
In the archives with Greer, this individual also apparently had a point of contact

1527
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:26,500
to a former Navy SEAL who was in charge of tracking UAPs coming out of a certain location.

1528
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,500
I don't know what this location is underwater.

1529
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,500
I contacted this person.

1530
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:36,500
I said, and I will say who the person is next live if I find their name is still in the DPI archive

1531
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,500
because it's listed out right.

1532
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,500
But I contacted this person. They're an elderly doctor.

1533
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,500
And I said, hey, would you be interested in talking about this?

1534
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,500
I found your name in the DPI archive.

1535
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,500
They didn't say no, it's not true.

1536
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,500
They just said, I'm not interested.

1537
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:51,500
And kind of a little back and forth with them telling me to kind of get lost.

1538
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,500
So that was pretty dang interesting to me.

1539
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,500
Seven days in May, that's it.

1540
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,500
I was almost, I was almost on it.

1541
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:02,500
Almost on it.

1542
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:07,500
When I said I wanted your views, it was in reference to whistleblowers you haven't spoken to directly.

1543
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:10,500
Oh, okay.

1544
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,500
Whistleblowers I haven't spoken to directly.

1545
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,500
Well, I would like to speak to them.

1546
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,500
I just really enjoy talking to a lot of these people.

1547
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:23,500
But there are a lot of prospective whistleblowers I will be trying to contact soon.

1548
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,500
Large light formation hanging low in the sky.

1549
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,500
Unbelievable color and formation free.

1550
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
Mental Western Australia in 2005.

1551
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
Tell me more about it.

1552
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,500
What did this formation do?

1553
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:34,500
What color was it and so forth?

1554
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:41,500
Have you heard anything about the UAP so big it was presumably buried under something?

1555
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:46,500
Of course, TB has spoken about one buried in Seoul, South Korea and his notes.

1556
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:51,500
I think there are some people that think that the UAP Ross Colt Hart is referring to that was so big,

1557
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:55,500
which I'm certain that you're referring to is in Pine Gap Australia.

1558
01:46:55,500 --> 01:47:02,500
I have not received any sort of interesting intelligence or kind of investigation on that subject.

1559
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,500
I know very little about it.

1560
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:09,500
I know very little about it, but I just don't even know where to begin researching where that site may be.

1561
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,500
June Crane is worth a video.

1562
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,500
Okay.

1563
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,500
Her statements corroborate.

1564
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,500
Roswell and her credentials are proven.

1565
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,500
She had Q clearance.

1566
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:17,500
Researcher interviewed is still alive today and is extremely kind.

1567
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,500
Former LEO.

1568
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Okay.

1569
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,500
I will.

1570
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,500
I would absolutely do that and try and contact that guy.

1571
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:30,500
You know, we, we need the Greer and Herrera insider to come forward publicly and end this debate once and for all to expose PLF,

1572
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Psychotronics used in fake abduction, ARVs, EMW attacks.

1573
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,500
I completely agree.

1574
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:41,500
I think this individual coming forward will, will, would be monumental,

1575
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
especially if this person came forward with evidence.

1576
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,500
I would like to see that.

1577
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
Literally trying to get bro to the loose and they listen.

1578
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:54,500
I don't, I don't do, I don't do, uh, I don't do any substances, but I don't have problems of people do if they're an adult.

1579
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,500
And that's what they, that's what they choose to do.

1580
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,500
It's, it's their body, their choice.

1581
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:06,500
Uh, man's doesn't look like he needs any more trouble keeping it together.

1582
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,500
Keep kicking butt.

1583
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,500
Best show on the topic.

1584
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:10,500
I appreciate that man.

1585
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,500
Much love.

1586
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,500
Thank you very much.

1587
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,500
That means the most.

1588
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,500
Uh, sorry.

1589
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,500
Greer was telling the truth about Admiral Wilson's briefing documents.

1590
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,500
He's telling the truth for decades.

1591
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,500
No one believed him.

1592
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,500
Doesn't that tell you something?

1593
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:23,500
Absolutely.

1594
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,500
Absolutely.

1595
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,500
It does Greer.

1596
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:35,500
I mean, I think Admiral Wilson even admitted to speaking to Greer, but even when he still denied the, the, sorry, my brain's being scared.

1597
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,500
Even when he denied the allegations of the Wilson Davis memo being true, but Greer did do that.

1598
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,500
Yes.

1599
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500
That's why I think that is why I took the approach.

1600
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:46,500
I did it with Greer's witnesses that they really need to be investigated.

1601
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,500
The filter.

1602
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,500
Who has big eyes?

1603
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,500
Let me know who, let me know who has, who has the big eyes.

1604
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,500
Like, I'd like to hear about that.

1605
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,500
Love what you do.

1606
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,500
Keep the deep eyes.

1607
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:57,500
Thank you for training your excellent work.

1608
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:00,500
Had some weird results with CE5 over the years, but recommended even if it's just to go stargazing.

1609
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,500
I would like to hear about this.

1610
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,500
Absolutely.

1611
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,500
Please.

1612
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:07,500
Mark.

1613
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,500
Yes.

1614
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,500
This is important to know about Mark.

1615
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,500
Mark was an aerospace contractor illustrator.

1616
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,500
He did a ton of work, a ton of great work.

1617
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:18,500
And he also has a lot of interesting points of contact and so forth.

1618
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:22,500
Let me get some cold brew.

1619
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:23,500
Sorry guys.

1620
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:27,500
Remember when Dodie said ETs like straw?

1621
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:28,500
Did he?

1622
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:34,500
I don't remember him saying that, but I, I don't, I don't, I don't doubt that.

1623
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,500
Have you had a UAP setting up some kind?

1624
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,500
Yeah.

1625
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,500
I talked about this last time.

1626
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,500
I don't ever really talk about it just because it's, it's not too big of a deal.

1627
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:47,500
You know, I think like many people have had experiences just where I've seen these strange

1628
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:52,500
lights in the sky, strange formations doing zigzagging in the sky and so forth, but no

1629
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:56,500
tangible actual craft or an actual structure I could make out.

1630
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:01,500
And I would talk about it more if I had, if I myself had seen the exact body of a saucer

1631
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,500
or a triangle.

1632
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:05,500
The five eyes things makes a lot of sense when you start looking at the way the internet

1633
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:09,500
globally, NC and AU are high or handy just based on geography.

1634
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,500
Absolutely.

1635
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,500
Absolutely.

1636
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:15,500
I also think there's a lot of interesting Australia stuff to, to study.

1637
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:18,500
Rogan is skeptical of anything coming from the government to be honest.

1638
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:21,500
Chuck Schumer, Hilly Clinton being involved in disclosure is kind of weird.

1639
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,500
There's evidence Hillary has known something.

1640
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,500
Yeah.

1641
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,500
With John Podesta.

1642
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,500
Absolutely.

1643
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,500
That is weird.

1644
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,500
And maybe that ties into what we talked about at the beginning of this live stream where

1645
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:35,500
we were talked about first being approached to buy white hats or blue team under the Clinton

1646
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,500
administration.

1647
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,500
Who knows?

1648
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,500
Okay.

1649
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:45,500
I was told UAP is hide in our underground aquifer surfacing through connected lakes and streams.

1650
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,500
They are well hidden.

1651
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,500
That is, that is very interesting.

1652
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:53,500
That is very interesting, especially with stories of UAP kind of appearing from lakes and so

1653
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,500
forth.

1654
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,500
That's actually really interesting.

1655
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,500
I've never heard that.

1656
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,500
Your spine on your, yeah, that's a good point.

1657
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:02,500
Five eyes, five eyes joint intelligence.

1658
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:05,500
What are your thoughts on the UFO that is way too big to move?

1659
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,500
Elizondo was asked about it in a recent interview.

1660
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,500
We just talked about this.

1661
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:11,500
That is from the, I think originally proposed by Ross Colt Hart.

1662
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,500
I've heard some people say South, South Korea.

1663
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
Some people say Pine Gap Australia.

1664
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:21,500
I don't know what that, I don't know what the heck to think.

1665
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,500
Really Greer is worth researching.

1666
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:25,500
The guy is a lot more in the know than anyone else in the field.

1667
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,500
Chris is life dedicated to this and what's the trauma surgeon?

1668
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,500
Absolutely.

1669
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:35,500
That is why I have dedicated probably two hours of every single day to studying Greer's materials.

1670
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:38,500
Absolutely.

1671
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:41,500
Greed with all this witness folks on favorite graves.

1672
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
There are so many, many better cases and witnesses out there.

1673
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,500
I agree.

1674
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:47,500
One of those I'd like to see is Mr. TB.

1675
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:50,500
Great point mentioning Hellendale radar cross-section facilities.

1676
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,500
Definitely a place worth keeping an eye on.

1677
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:56,500
It was as was the Lockheed Lighthouse in Virginia.

1678
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,500
Yeah, that's an interesting location to mention.

1679
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:02,500
Again, if you weren't here when we talked about the Hellendale site earlier,

1680
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:05,500
Greer in his symposium today talked about Hellendale,

1681
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:08,500
posted pictures of it, said he was flown over this site,

1682
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,500
but didn't mention Hellendale.

1683
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Also checked the DPI archive and found it very strange that all sort of images of Hellendale

1684
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:21,500
in reference to Hellendale were kind of taken off the photo site.

1685
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:24,500
Greer in graves are such experienced pilots as were the radar operators.

1686
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:25,500
Yes.

1687
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,500
No, I think the balloon.

1688
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:32,500
Yeah, those cases are not, especially multi-sensor detection like that.

1689
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,500
No.

1690
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,500
What are your thoughts about the Soviet Union UFO cases where UFO above a nuclear silo

1691
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,500
is activated multiple nuclear ICBMs?

1692
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,500
Yeah, that's so interesting because of course, in a lot of our cases here,

1693
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:45,500
but not AFB, any cases of malabstrom around nuclear arms.

1694
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:50,500
It always seems like that the Minutemen missiles or the ICBMs are basically effectively rendered useless

1695
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:53,500
and there are Russian cases about them almost being activated.

1696
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:56,500
I don't know what to think about that, to be honest.

1697
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:59,500
Really don't.

1698
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:07,500
I can't remember, I can't prove it, but I remember reading Trump was only briefed on UAP.

1699
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:13,500
You're remembering that from Lou and Ross Colthart have both said that.

1700
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,500
Why would our UAP moderators claim Greer is a charlatan?

1701
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:19,500
I had a post removed a while back after sharing a link to one of his documents.

1702
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,500
I think that's kind of bogus.

1703
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:28,500
Sharing Greer documents is kind of wild to just say that's a disinformation or not true.

1704
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,500
That would be huge.

1705
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:30,500
Appreciate it.

1706
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,500
Been talking with the stones.

1707
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:35,500
You've been talking with stones for recently, but brain feed or internship would be a dream.

1708
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,500
How can I send you my contact info?

1709
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,500
Either join the Discord.

1710
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:40,500
I'll post the link in the here.

1711
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,500
Sorry.

1712
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:44,500
I need to remember how to invite people.

1713
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,500
I'll post the Discord link in here.

1714
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,500
Otherwise, UAPGIRB at gmail.com.

1715
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:51,500
Here's the Discord link if anybody would like to join.

1716
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:55,500
There's been some good discussion today and you can see all my notes as they were from

1717
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,500
today's presentation.

1718
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,500
Heaps of short boys.

1719
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,500
Guys, can you hear me?

1720
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,500
I think I accidentally just left the live.

1721
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:18,500
If anybody can hear me, let me know.

1722
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:22,500
Let me know if you can hear me.

1723
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,500
Okay.

1724
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,500
I think I'm still live.

1725
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,500
Somebody let me know, please.

1726
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,500
Okay.

1727
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,500
Great.

1728
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,500
I'm sorry.

1729
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,500
I accidentally just hit a, I have one of those gaming, gaming mouses.

1730
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:34,500
So I actually just backed out.

1731
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,500
I'm going to try to find out exactly where I was.

1732
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,500
I'm very sorry for that, guys.

1733
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,500
Okay.

1734
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,500
Here we go.

1735
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:41,500
Sorry about that, guys.

1736
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,500
My bad.

1737
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,500
I went into UAP with three others about 15 years ago.

1738
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,500
It looked to be a green shooting star.

1739
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,500
It fell long enough to call attention to it.

1740
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,500
Then accelerated to a 45 degree England disappeared.

1741
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:54,500
That's very interesting, especially with the case I'm covering right now being labeled a

1742
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,500
meteor until it turned 25 degrees.

1743
01:54:56,500 --> 01:55:00,500
So that is a, that's really interesting to hear the flying lotus.

1744
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:03,500
Yes, flying, flying lotus is a fan of the Gerb channel.

1745
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,500
And I'm a fan of his music.

1746
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
Excellent music.

1747
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:10,500
I'm surprised there hasn't been anyone who takes psychedelics before doing CE5.

1748
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:16,500
Because we know the, the P3 people are given a cocktail of drugs before they're what we

1749
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,500
would call their version of CE5 experience.

1750
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,500
I wanted to know what I've seen ever since.

1751
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,500
No idea what it could do.

1752
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:24,500
These things I saw it do.

1753
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:31,500
I, when you see impossible feats in the sky, there's a very, very strange.

1754
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:34,500
Let's go to, is it triangle formation?

1755
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,500
Okay.

1756
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:38,500
You were talking about your UFO sighting triangle formation, triangle light formation above

1757
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:42,500
your garden, coming to a sudden stop, changing colors, pulsating, suddenly skipping, flying

1758
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:44,500
off into an instant at the speed of a modern day jet.

1759
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:50,500
I wonder if that is like a TR3B or some ARV.

1760
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:54,500
People love dismissing plant-based contact experience.

1761
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,500
I think so.

1762
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:00,500
Again, I don't have a lot of, I'm pretty uninformed on any sort of psychedelic.

1763
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:06,500
So I, my opinion is probably one of the most ill-informed, ill-informed out there.

1764
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:09,500
It still amazed me that Schumer Rounds Memo doesn't get more attention because the fact

1765
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:13,500
they both pushed for it, yes, especially with 27 mentions of non-human intelligence, the

1766
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:19,500
mention of legacy programs, the mention of UAP materials being misclassified under the

1767
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:25,500
1954 atomic energy agreement under transclassified foreign nuclear materials.

1768
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,500
Let's go.

1769
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,500
Why should people take abduction cases from their beds seriously?

1770
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,500
Why take any of this seriously?

1771
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:38,500
I think in terms of abduction cases, especially from the bed, the research of John Mack was

1772
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:43,500
used just to try and find similarities between, between kind of cases.

1773
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,500
Anthony, thank you so much for the five bucks.

1774
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
Have I ever looked into the Eiger 1992 video?

1775
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:51,500
The detail in the life form makes it hard to debunk.

1776
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:59,500
Let me, I feel like I've heard of that.

1777
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:02,500
Let me get back to you on that because I feel like I've heard of that video.

1778
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:06,500
I can't recall it off the top of my head.

1779
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:09,500
I love your logical no clickbait approach.

1780
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,500
Your channel is massively under subscribed.

1781
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:12,500
I appreciate that.

1782
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:16,500
I hate clickbait because I grew up before clickbait was a real thing.

1783
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:21,500
So back in the day when there'd be videos saying like, oh, don't watch, don't, don't play

1784
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,500
Minecraft at 3am, warning scary.

1785
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:26,500
I, that just puts such a sour taste in my mouth.

1786
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,500
Kai, thank you.

1787
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:30,500
I see it and I can't wait to talk to you about that after watching it.

1788
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,500
It's sad what happened to Mark.

1789
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,500
Absolutely.

1790
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,500
Hey, what's up, Aussie, my Aussie brethren.

1791
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,500
Nice to see you, man.

1792
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:40,500
Why are there so many Democrats involved in disclosure?

1793
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:43,500
Interesting question, especially kind of Clinton, Podesta and so forth.

1794
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:48,500
Now it's a, hopefully we can continue this issue being a little bit more middle of the aisle.

1795
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,500
Some of the best UAP contract content out there.

1796
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,500
I appreciate that man.

1797
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,500
Seriously, much love.

1798
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,500
That, that means the most.

1799
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:59,500
Um, let's see.

1800
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:04,500
Let's get to a video debunking Mick West claims.

1801
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:05,500
That would be fun.

1802
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:09,500
I see, I leave that to guys like Merrick Von Damic.

1803
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,500
I can never say his last name.

1804
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:16,500
I leave, leave that to men like that who are a little bit more well versed in their claims

1805
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:20,500
of counter analyses because I don't have the same analysis skills on sightings and so forth

1806
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,500
as Merrick does to kind of counter Mick West's claims and so forth.

1807
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:28,500
Of course I could when he says stuff just really out of pocket stuff when it comes to

1808
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:32,500
kind of, uh, whistleblowers and so forth.

1809
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,500
That would be, uh, let's see.

1810
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:38,500
Hillary wanted disclosure, but Obama got out of the way to comment on UFOs and was making a Betty.

1811
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:44,500
That is weird that, uh, that Obama is now producing a Betty and Barney Hill documentary.

1812
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,500
I haven't heard any update on that.

1813
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:50,500
If you, I first met Greer in the nineties in Pensacola, Florida at Sacred Heart Hospital.

1814
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:54,500
He, he was a trauma surgeon at, uh, at Sacred Heart, right?

1815
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,500
I think that's where he was.

1816
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:59,500
Now the Illuminati in contact with the bad end at H.I.

1817
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,500
And the ones being shot down are the good guys.

1818
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:02,500
I don't know.

1819
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:08,500
Of course I've heard of interfactionality of NHIs and ETs, but I'm not sure to which, to what extent that goes.

1820
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,500
And of course you listened to David Grush talk about agreements with NHI.

1821
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:15,500
I'm not sure, uh, what agreements have been made with whom.

1822
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:18,500
Police chiefs across the U.S. have issued the first official.

1823
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,500
That's very interesting.

1824
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:25,500
Ross Colard posted that last week providing law enforcement, uh, enforcement officers with instructions on how to report and respond.

1825
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:26,500
Yes, that's great.

1826
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:31,500
I'll link that in the discord because that's a, that's a really good document.

1827
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:38,500
But from what I hear right when presidents are disproportionately briefed as there's a strong presence of fascist and or religious fundamentalists such as Collins Leighton, the program.

1828
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,500
I've heard that too.

1829
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:45,500
Especially of interest being briefed who I think is a little overlooked is Lyndon B. Johnson.

1830
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,500
I'll give you guys a little tasty treat right here.

1831
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:58,500
Um, Lyndon B. Johnson, you guys remember my video on Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who talked about Dr. Eric Walker being involved in UFO crash retrieval since the early 1950s with Vannevar Bush.

1832
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:09,500
Robert Sarbacher also self admitted that he was part of UAP, uh, collection efforts as well as knew what the majestic 12 was as well as said he was himself present at the Kecksburg UFO crash in 1965.

1833
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:17,500
Well, Dr. Eric Walker and Lyndon B. Johnson had a very close correspondence where they would say send each other very personal letters.

1834
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:20,500
So that's really interesting to see a link between those two.

1835
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:26,500
Uh, what do I think of the eye?

1836
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:28,500
I saw the image, but I never investigated further.

1837
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:35,500
Uh, maybe I will sometime, but there was just so much, uh, so much, there's just always so much going on so many cases to look at.

1838
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,500
Uh, Edgar Mitchell spoke about this.

1839
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:42,500
Edgar Mitchell and, uh, uh, Gordon Cooper.

1840
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,500
Very interesting guys.

1841
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,500
What's up awakening to reality?

1842
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,500
How you doing, bro?

1843
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,500
How you doing?

1844
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:48,500
Loud and clear.

1845
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,500
Okay.

1846
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,500
I think this is when I just got back.

1847
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,500
If the feds got me, I'll go kicking and screaming, man.

1848
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,500
I'll go kicking and screaming.

1849
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:58,500
Hey, Jorgen, thank you for the 119 Norwegian Krona.

1850
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,500
How far back do you believe IC has investigated infiltrated the phenomena?

1851
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,500
An example did O and I cover the Aurora incident.

1852
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:05,500
That's a great question.

1853
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:07,500
I'd say at least 1933.

1854
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:18,500
Um, the Aurora incident, I think is a case that really warrants a lot of investigation, especially due to some of the circumstantial, not really evidence, but, uh, circumstantial details of the case being really interesting, such as.

1855
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:23,500
The idea that some of the craft parts were thrown down a well, which poisoned local residents and so forth.

1856
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:28,500
Possibly before then, but I think maybe the earliest we could go is maybe 1897 with the Aurora incident.

1857
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,500
But thank you again, man.

1858
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,500
I really appreciate that.

1859
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,500
What do you think about the UAP tether incident?

1860
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:36,500
I knew you did a video on fast workers, but I don't remember if you covered that incident.

1861
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,500
I don't think I did cover that incident.

1862
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:41,500
Now I would actually like to cover the UAP tether incident.

1863
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:48,500
Doing yourself a disservice by, uh, contact experiences, maybe look at the content of the experience for you right off as.

1864
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,500
Okay.

1865
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:50,500
I think you might be talking to somebody else.

1866
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:54,500
I, because I, I'm just not, not acknowledgeable.

1867
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:55,500
Awaken into reality.

1868
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:59,500
Thank you so much for the 899, uh, New Zealand dollars.

1869
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:00,500
Thank you very much.

1870
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,500
I really appreciate that, man.

1871
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:05,500
The Eiger 1992 alien video is fake.

1872
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:08,500
Tristan, I will have to, I absolutely have to watch that.

1873
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:12,500
I think Democrat leaders are cock blocked from being briefed on the UFO compared to GOP since they may have balls.

1874
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:15,500
Honestly, to further disclose if they get too much information, they're risky.

1875
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:16,500
That could be a valid point.

1876
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:20,500
I like that hypothesis.

1877
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:24,500
Interesting research done at Imperial College in London where different DMTs were used to map out the space.

1878
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:29,500
Oh, that is interesting to map out like a, uh, basically create a map of the space.

1879
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:33,500
Hey, uh, I got, let me, let me go off on a quick tangent here, guys.

1880
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:38,500
Cause I probably won't get to this question about five minutes for any of my gamers in the chat.

1881
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:41,500
Have any of you guys played the new war hammer space marines two game?

1882
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:46,500
I know I'll get to those questions in about five minutes, but I would like to read if anybody has, has read them.

1883
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,500
Uh, Von Rennen camp.

1884
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,500
That's it.

1885
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:52,500
He just appeared on a Ross Colt part and yes, I, I can't pronounce stuff.

1886
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,500
I, I just can't.

1887
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:57,500
Did you watch Tom Begert and psychotronics lecture on how to achieve anti-gravity free energy?

1888
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,500
No, I have not yet.

1889
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:02,500
I still need to, I have been consumed with the case I'm working on right now.

1890
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:05,500
And that is because it is a 23 page script.

1891
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,500
So it took me a heck of a long time.

1892
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:13,500
Who are the world's best known living intellectual living intellectuals and public speakers?

1893
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:16,500
Where are their comments on the phenomenon?

1894
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:17,500
Uh, good question.

1895
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:21,500
We could go with guys like Sir Roger Penrose and so forth.

1896
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,500
Some best known living intellectuals.

1897
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:27,500
I don't think a lot of them have really, uh, spoken on, on the phenomenon.

1898
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,500
John Doe.

1899
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,500
What's going on, brother?

1900
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,500
Do you believe the skinny Bob alien video?

1901
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,500
I try and stay away from that until there's, uh, a lot of the topics that have just kind

1902
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:38,500
of an endless debate.

1903
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:46,500
I try and stay away from just because if my research, if not a lot of research has been

1904
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:50,500
advanced on something and maybe my research is just going to get caught in the same loop.

1905
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:55,500
Um, I might just kind of wait a little bit until I have something, some actionable information

1906
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,500
to pursue on, on stuff.

1907
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,500
And I do not on skinny Bob right now.

1908
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,500
As a youngster, I loved watching the dang video.

1909
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,500
I'll tell you that much.

1910
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:05,500
America is afraid of the phenomenon is communist Nazi, but they're becoming what they sought

1911
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:06,500
to destroy.

1912
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,500
It's 40 chairs.

1913
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,500
Absolutely in the cold war and so forth.

1914
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,500
We absolutely were.

1915
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:11,500
Absolutely.

1916
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:14,500
It goes all the way back to, uh, project paperclip and Alan Dole's.

1917
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:15,500
Yes.

1918
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:18,500
Alan Dole is in, uh, the 1933 magenta crash.

1919
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,500
The door's old boys.

1920
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:23,500
Claudio, thank you so much for the 499.

1921
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:24,500
My apologies.

1922
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,500
Donation for going off topic about internships and chat.

1923
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,500
Keep it up.

1924
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:29,500
You and Jesse Michaels be such a good convo.

1925
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:30,500
No problem, man.

1926
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:31,500
This chat's open to anybody.

1927
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:33,500
We're not going to restrict anything.

1928
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,500
Anybody says, but I really appreciate that.

1929
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:36,500
Thank you very much.

1930
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:39,500
Twist UAP Leonard Stringfield was one of the best UFO crash researchers.

1931
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:41,500
If true, his info is mind blowing.

1932
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:45,500
I'd like to take a second and I know I say this in every single video.

1933
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:49,500
And in my upcoming video, I will talk about Stringfield at length, but Stringfield is the

1934
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:50,500
best of the best.

1935
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:53,500
The UFO crash retrievals parts one through seven are sublime.

1936
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:58,500
That is what I will stand by as the best ever work done on the subject in terms of crash

1937
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,500
retrievals.

1938
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:01,500
It is phenomenal sublime.

1939
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,500
Leonard Stringfield is the best.

1940
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:07,500
One of my personal dreams is to be able to access his personal records at Mufon Cincinnati,

1941
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:13,500
sit with a, with a cold brew for 12 hours and read every single note he ever took.

1942
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,500
The tether video is wild.

1943
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,500
Yes.

1944
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:20,500
The Cabal's goal is full spectrum of dominance as they say in official documents to achieve

1945
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,500
that they need the whole world to unite around fear.

1946
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:26,500
Perfect way to do that is through a fake ET invasion, or as David Gresh would say, a

1947
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,500
feudalistic dominance.

1948
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,500
And, and I agree.

1949
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:34,500
I'm still, I still have my problems with, with paper clip or the, I'm sorry, the idea

1950
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,500
of project blue beam and so forth, but I do understand that point.

1951
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,500
I do think the, I think the unbearable truth of the phenomenon might be that there's an

1952
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:44,500
afterlife for everyone and the unbearable part is where the world collapses due to people

1953
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,500
self-checking out.

1954
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:47,500
I think that was explored in a movie, right?

1955
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:48,500
With Jason Seagal.

1956
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,500
I don't think it was very good, but I think that concept was explored.

1957
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:53,500
What would people do if they learned they had an afterlife?

1958
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,500
That's an interesting idea.

1959
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:00,500
Oh, no, no worries with a, no worries with spam.

1960
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:02,500
Mrs. Floyd, thank you very much.

1961
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,500
Yes.

1962
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:04,500
There's a lot of Norwegians here.

1963
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,500
Somebody even recognized the front line shirt, which is great.

1964
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:11,500
The Danny Cheehan interview on Jesse Michaels American Alchemy show is amazing.

1965
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,500
If anyone hasn't watched it, you watch, watch anything by Jesse Michaels.

1966
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:18,500
Jesse Michaels is amazing and he has some really cool projects and the work that I think

1967
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,500
you guys are really going to like.

1968
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:21,500
Jesse Michaels is the real deal.

1969
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:23,500
Have I played No Man's Sky?

1970
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:25,500
One of the best, if not the best space games out there.

1971
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:26,500
Yeah.

1972
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:28,500
I've played, I've played, I've done like four different playthroughs of it.

1973
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:29,500
I love it.

1974
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:33,500
There's nothing like having a nice crisp diet cola night and just flying through on your

1975
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:34,500
new S-class ship.

1976
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:35,500
I love it.

1977
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:40,500
Best thing I ate in Japan, that would probably have to be, um, yukatsu.

1978
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:46,500
Yukatsu steak where you have steak cooked lightly, lightly fried on the outside with,

1979
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:51,500
um, cooked to a rare medium rare and you're given like a hot plate basically to sear it

1980
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:55,500
how you want yourself to then dip it in the various sauces.

1981
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:56,500
It was sublime.

1982
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:58,500
One of the best things I've ever eaten.

1983
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:01,500
I feel like right wing presidents would be far more likely to disclose.

1984
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,500
Conservatives are way, way more wary of big government and government outreach.

1985
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:09,500
I agree, but do presidents have the ability to disclose?

1986
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:11,500
Penrose is the goat.

1987
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:12,500
Absolutely.

1988
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,500
Physics goat.

1989
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:17,500
SDS, 114 UFO video in space is weird.

1990
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:18,500
It makes a U-turn.

1991
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:19,500
One of the weirdest space.

1992
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,500
Yeah.

1993
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,500
I think I put that in the fast walker video.

1994
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,500
It's a very strange, strange video.

1995
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:27,500
If we created simulated realities like video games, why wouldn't the beans above us not do

1996
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,500
the same?

1997
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:29,500
I agree.

1998
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,500
Sorry.

1999
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,500
You get a sip of water.

2000
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:32,500
Yeah.

2001
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:33,500
I agree.

2002
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:39,300
I think, um, I can't remember what podcast it was, but there's a man who did a podcast

2003
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:41,300
on simulation theory.

2004
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:43,300
And one of those was with the ability to simulate.

2005
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:46,300
There will be an endless amount of simulations.

2006
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:52,300
And we thus have a greater probability of being one of said simulations.

2007
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,300
But by whom?

2008
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:54,300
I don't know.

2009
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,300
David of Salem.

2010
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:57,300
My contact experience was a possible one.

2011
02:07:57,300 --> 02:08:00,300
They seemed to take it back that I could see them as I was.

2012
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:02,300
It was like we abducted each other rather than mine.

2013
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:07,300
I think I've heard that in some abduction cases of, of beans almost being surprised that they

2014
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,300
were, they have been noticed.

2015
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:09,300
Cheers from Norway.

2016
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,300
Cheers to you.

2017
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:12,300
I hope to be back to, to Norway soon, man.

2018
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:15,300
I love that some Norwegians watch, watch this channel.

2019
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:19,300
It's, um, thoughts on the tall whites.

2020
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,300
The tall whites are interesting.

2021
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:24,300
Um, of course, with many gray sightings of abductees and so forth, there's a lot of the

2022
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:29,300
time like a tall white, as some people say, like venusians, mantis type beans alongside

2023
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:31,300
the, the gray, the drones.

2024
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:35,300
I don't know what to think because abductions isn't really my bread and butter.

2025
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:39,300
I still am just trying to investigate what the heck are some of the bodies that are discovered

2026
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,300
at some of the crash sites.

2027
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:42,300
Phil Snyder, we talked about this before.

2028
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:44,300
Some of his claims are, are very interesting.

2029
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:46,300
They're very big too.

2030
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,300
His claims are very big.

2031
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:52,300
And, uh, in terms of getting into a firefight underground with NHI where soldiers were basically

2032
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:54,300
turned to goop, uh, alongside him.

2033
02:08:54,300 --> 02:09:00,300
But I have, I'm, I'm probably would start with researching his death if I do, if I do some

2034
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,300
research into him.

2035
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:05,300
The skinny Bob looks like CGI to me, but I want to believe that one.

2036
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:06,300
It does.

2037
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:07,300
It looks a little buttery.

2038
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:09,300
It looks a little buttery.

2039
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:15,300
Hey, dude, I hope the Browns lose because the bangles got beat by one of the worst teams

2040
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:16,300
in the NFL today.

2041
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:19,300
And I'm very upset.

2042
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:21,300
We're skyfire, skyfire news.

2043
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:22,300
I'm not quite sure.

2044
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:24,300
I am not quite sure.

2045
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:28,300
Matilda O'Donnell Roswell interview mentioned a gray, didn't know English till I read the

2046
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:31,300
book that night and they were, uh, over the White House.

2047
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,300
Yeah.

2048
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:34,300
And what they, what were they over the White House?

2049
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:39,300
Um, a lot of Roswell witnesses, including the, um, including the photographer at Roswell

2050
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,300
mentioned grays.

2051
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:43,300
They are forced for peace and nuclear disarmament.

2052
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,300
They try and promote a message of peace.

2053
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:47,300
They could have various effects on electronics on off.

2054
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,300
Yeah.

2055
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:52,300
Kevin Knuth at his soul foundation, uh, did a lot of interesting talk about this with

2056
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:57,300
electric fields and magnetic fields of UAP and they're interacting with technology and

2057
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:00,300
so forth.

2058
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,300
Okay.

2059
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:03,300
Sorry.

2060
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,300
Project blue beam is disinformation.

2061
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,300
I tend to lead towards this too.

2062
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:08,300
It was made up by Dottie.

2063
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:09,300
I didn't know that.

2064
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:17,300
Um, I blue beam, at least in my experience has been used by people I know who want to

2065
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,300
discount, um, UFOs.

2066
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:24,300
And I know in that comment, I said, like, I could understand, uh, the utilizing of a

2067
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:29,300
invasion for fear, but I still think that that is mainly based off of Reagan's Reagan

2068
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:31,300
speech and, uh, disinformation.

2069
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:34,300
If skinny Bob is faked is incredibly well done.

2070
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:36,300
When I met them, they looked just like that.

2071
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:37,300
Interesting.

2072
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:39,300
Convincing for so long.

2073
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:40,300
That's a good point.

2074
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:44,300
It could only be, uh, it could only be for convincing as long as the holograms could, could

2075
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:46,300
stay up in the, in the air.

2076
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:52,300
Um, maybe, uh, the weird after effects on skinny Bob.

2077
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:55,300
I've heard of those.

2078
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:59,300
It was any Jacobson that said the Roswell crash was rushing towards and Dottie to an

2079
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:00,300
unacknowledged of Greer.

2080
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:05,300
But I think, uh, uh, any Jacobson said that recently on her Sean Ryan appearance, I think

2081
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,300
it was, and she was on, uh, Jerry, Jonathan Reed footage.

2082
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:14,300
Uh, listen, I heard of Jonathan Reed a long time ago on mysterious universe.

2083
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:17,300
If you guys know, uh, that podcast, it's great.

2084
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:21,300
And his story was, I think a lot of, I almost posited.

2085
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:24,300
This is Jonathan Reed story because of the NHI body.

2086
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:28,300
Jonathan Reed claims to have a, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, because if I am, I'll retract

2087
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:29,300
my statement right away.

2088
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:34,300
But Jonathan Reed claims to have slain a, uh, a, a creature that, that creature he has

2089
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:36,300
photographed with a samurai sword.

2090
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:39,300
I believe that's what he said and then put it on nice.

2091
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:46,300
Uh, and also the photos of the wedge shaped craft are very weirdly proportioned, very

2092
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:48,300
weirdly proportioned.

2093
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,300
Uh, so many good videos ruined with crap editing.

2094
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,300
Yeah.

2095
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,300
I tend to agree.

2096
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,300
I tend to agree.

2097
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:59,300
I held Roswell foil to it heats when flame took the same as cutting metal holding the

2098
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:00,300
hand.

2099
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:01,300
You held Roswell material.

2100
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:04,300
I would like to hear, I would like to hear more about that.

2101
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:07,300
What's the best thing I ate at a gas station in Norway and did you get it?

2102
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:11,300
Or what's the best thing you ate in Norway and did you eat at a gas station for all my

2103
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,300
Norwegians out there?

2104
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,300
You will know what a hot dog on Lumpa is.

2105
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:19,300
And that's like a Norwegian bread tortilla that gas stations, but hot dogs on it.

2106
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:20,300
And then they're so good.

2107
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,300
They're amazing.

2108
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,300
They are amazing.

2109
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:27,300
Also wanted to tell you about two picks of alleged dead aliens I saw.

2110
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:30,800
They reminded me of one from EBEs described in the MJ 12 manual, the non gray ones will

2111
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:31,800
send them on discord.

2112
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:33,300
I would love to, I would excuse me.

2113
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:35,300
I would love to see that please.

2114
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:39,300
Did you see the video of the UFO in orbit that gets shot up by some weapon?

2115
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,300
Yeah.

2116
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:41,300
Like the kind of like light beam.

2117
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:42,300
Yes, I have seen that.

2118
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:46,300
And I don't know what to make of it because I haven't spent too much time looking at it.

2119
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:50,300
I think it was, it was in not lost century.

2120
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,300
Was it in unacknowledged?

2121
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:56,300
Take a look at UAP Gerb's eyes.

2122
02:12:56,300 --> 02:12:58,300
He is a Pleiadian alien.

2123
02:12:58,300 --> 02:12:59,300
That'd be cool, man.

2124
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:00,300
I wish I was.

2125
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:05,300
If I was, I'd be the first to tell you, but I am just a human.

2126
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:07,300
I would like to see the original skinny Bob video.

2127
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:09,300
I wonder where that has obviously been cropped down.

2128
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:14,300
I would like to as well, but it with a, with those videos, this just, at least for me,

2129
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:16,300
I couldn't come to a conclusion.

2130
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:19,300
So it'd be difficult for me to engage thoughts on the tall whites.

2131
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:21,300
Very interesting to me.

2132
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:25,300
I'm still trying to start out what the heck kind of the graves or the small creatures,

2133
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:27,300
the EBE type ones and twos are.

2134
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:32,300
And then we will get to the kind of description of the mantis type beings or the tall, tall

2135
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:35,300
graves or venusians and so forth.

2136
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:39,300
The problem with new wave of UFO experts is they don't understand the science of free

2137
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:40,300
energy, anti-gravity.

2138
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:41,300
They could easily be deceived.

2139
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,300
Any saucer that attacks us would be considered ET.

2140
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:50,300
I do agree that a lot of new wave UFO folks don't necessarily understand the physics

2141
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:52,300
behind UAP and kind of ARV.

2142
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,300
I certainly don't.

2143
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:57,300
I'll be the first to admit that physics is never, never my strong suit.

2144
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:59,300
The book identifies companies and crafts still secret.

2145
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:05,300
Bob Dean had the book in foil 1988 England.

2146
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:08,300
I think the whole bad abduction versus good abduction experience is similar to having good

2147
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:09,300
versus bad trips on psychedelics.

2148
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:13,300
That's an, that is an interesting point.

2149
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:17,300
I believe most abductions in beds are most likely sleep paralysis.

2150
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:19,300
I have heard this too.

2151
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:23,300
Again, I like, I don't want to discount anyone's abduction experience.

2152
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:28,300
So I don't know what the heck to think, but they very well could be sleep paralysis.

2153
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:30,300
Las Vegas alien video.

2154
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:33,300
I don't think anything ever came of that.

2155
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:34,300
Right.

2156
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:42,300
I think Steven Dean or Steven donor on Twitter said he had was interviewing the person who

2157
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:43,300
took that footage.

2158
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:44,300
Right.

2159
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:46,300
But I don't think anything ever came of that.

2160
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:50,300
If I'm, if I'm remembering correctly, I stayed far away from that in the Miami mall stuff.

2161
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:55,300
Um, just wasn't not, not the sort of case I, I'd be investigating world of the world's

2162
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:58,300
movie is similar to the event where people were attacked and have blood drawn.

2163
02:14:58,300 --> 02:14:59,300
Yeah.

2164
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:03,300
The world of the world's the Tom Cruise version that came out in 2005 scared the crap out of

2165
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,300
me as a little kid that scared me so bad.

2166
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:08,300
What's the best publicly available UFO video you've seen?

2167
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:13,300
Um, that's a tough one just because I've kind of moved so far away from videos.

2168
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:17,300
I'd say right now it's probably the video of the, the triangle I always post.

2169
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:20,300
I can't remember exactly where that video was taken, but late at night triangle with

2170
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:24,300
three points of light on each vertex with one red light in the middle.

2171
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,300
I think that's a fantastic video.

2172
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:28,300
Fantastic.

2173
02:15:28,300 --> 02:15:30,300
The whole invasion.

2174
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:31,300
Yeah.

2175
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:32,300
I agree with this.

2176
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:36,300
I've said this before that the only, uh, blue beam claims are to point to, uh, to Reagan

2177
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:40,300
speech when he addressed the UN and said, I can't think of how quickly, uh, the world

2178
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:43,300
would come together with the threat of an alien invasion.

2179
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:44,300
Yeah.

2180
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:45,300
Okay.

2181
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:48,300
So this is with, uh, Jonathan Reed and the samurai sword.

2182
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,300
Yeah.

2183
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:53,300
That's been conveniently left out with a read story of a wedge kind of coming back and

2184
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:57,300
being popular with, with loose book in the description of the wedge shaped craft.

2185
02:15:57,300 --> 02:16:01,300
He did say he sl, he slayed the, the creature with a samurai sword.

2186
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,300
Reply to abduction comment.

2187
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:06,300
You can go on board the craft by a telepathic mind link via unseen plane of existence out

2188
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:07,300
of body consciousness.

2189
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:11,300
The same way ETs talk to people telepathically with the utilization of P three assets.

2190
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:12,300
I wouldn't be surprised.

2191
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:16,300
He used a big branch.

2192
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:17,300
Ah, okay.

2193
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:21,300
Maybe I was wrong about the sword, but he still slayed it with a club.

2194
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:23,300
Still slayed it with a club.

2195
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:26,300
Do I think I would look at some of John max abduction cases?

2196
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:27,300
Absolutely.

2197
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,300
I'd like to tackle the abduction phenomena.

2198
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:30,300
It's just, there's so much to do.

2199
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:34,300
So I really need to make sure we get in at a good time to, to focus fully on the abduction

2200
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:35,300
phenomena.

2201
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:38,300
The read teleportation video is whack, big whack.

2202
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:39,300
Yeah.

2203
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:42,300
I've seen it and I'll watch it again and I'll keep watching it, but there's a little whack.

2204
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:46,300
Project blue beam was not made by Dodie and disinfo usaps won't just use holograms.

2205
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:47,300
They'll use ARVs PLC.

2206
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:51,300
I think, yeah, this is, this is what a career would state, right?

2207
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:57,300
Especially with, with this TE or ET, I can't quite remember and the fake, the PLF abduction

2208
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:01,300
he occurred when he left the Nellis retrieval team.

2209
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:06,300
Chevrolet being locking Martin naps built a cannabis and blue book wonder if Hitler had

2210
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:07,300
them before the reverse engineering.

2211
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:08,300
I don't know.

2212
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:14,300
I had a, a good friend asked me earlier about a kind of Nazis and UAP reverse engineering.

2213
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:18,300
And besides hunt for his zero point and the stories of deep lock, I really haven't spent

2214
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:20,300
too much time, too much time researching.

2215
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:22,300
Well, Grush's op-ed come out this year.

2216
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,300
I truly hope so.

2217
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:25,300
I truly hope so.

2218
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:27,300
Will it be, is it still stuck in Dobser?

2219
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:28,300
I'm not quite sure.

2220
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:31,300
Now Grush is definitely not, not being lazy.

2221
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:37,300
I definitely think he is doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but I truly hope so.

2222
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:41,300
If the teleportation video didn't exist, the alien body would have to be significantly

2223
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,300
more credible.

2224
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:44,300
Unfortunately, dude decided to write a weird hype train to nowhere.

2225
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:45,300
Yes.

2226
02:17:45,300 --> 02:17:49,300
Have you seen the Sentinel Arizona footage recorded by Nick Williams?

2227
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:53,300
I don't think so, but I would like to see that.

2228
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:57,300
That was a ET UFO being shot with scalar waves and EM system weapons.

2229
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:59,300
That's the situation for almost a century.

2230
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:00,300
Yes.

2231
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:01,300
I have, I have heard that as well.

2232
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:08,300
And I'm, I'm coming to start to really, really seriously research that topic of, of scalar

2233
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:12,300
weapons and kind of what Greer sets about targeting craft.

2234
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:14,300
Plasma propulsion, MHD plasma.

2235
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:18,300
If I'm being correct, I think Oak Shannon has some notes on this that operate in like

2236
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:22,300
the 3.5 gigahertz range, creates a cloud, which they use as camouflage and to cool down

2237
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:23,300
the craft.

2238
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:30,300
Now what I have heard is that early types of ARVs used MHD Plasma Stopper Pulsion when

2239
02:18:30,300 --> 02:18:34,300
later configurations have used actual like anti-gravity techniques.

2240
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:37,300
Do I have anything to back that up or any evidence or research that?

2241
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:39,300
No, but I've heard that before.

2242
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:45,300
MH370, I think we'll probably stay away from, from MH370 on the channel.

2243
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:50,300
I think it's just a, it's very toxic, toxic subject at the moment.

2244
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:51,300
Oh yeah.

2245
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:55,300
Reed stated his dog was turned to ash.

2246
02:18:55,300 --> 02:19:01,300
That also reminds me of the 1950s Maori incident where I think a saucer discharged material.

2247
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:05,300
I can't remember if that case was labeled as a hoax or not or found to be, but where

2248
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:08,300
material allegedly hit a dog.

2249
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:11,300
Any update on Jesse, you and Jesse Michaels collaborating.

2250
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:14,300
I will be meeting Jesse tomorrow or Tuesday.

2251
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:20,300
I'm not quite sure which day yet and I will have an update then.

2252
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:22,300
What about the phenomena?

2253
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:27,300
Would you like to research the most aside from UAP, psionics, remote viewing?

2254
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:34,300
So that's tough because crash retrieval and reverse engineering are what I like the most.

2255
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:39,300
At this point, I'd probably like to go down and I'll say, I'll throw in ARVs.

2256
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:42,300
I can't throw ARVs in there as well because I want to research that.

2257
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:47,300
And I'll, I'll take, I want to research dumps, deep underground military bases.

2258
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:51,300
Oh, that green footage, but that footage is really cool too with the triangle scene

2259
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,300
from almost kind of height level.

2260
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:57,300
Yeah, that's a great, that's a, that's like a great video.

2261
02:19:57,300 --> 02:20:03,300
But you remember, there's like a ball of light in the middle that I think expands.

2262
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:07,300
And like, I think I'm, I think that's the video you're talking about.

2263
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:09,300
Let me know if, let me know if I'm right here.

2264
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:12,300
I could be wrong, but I think that's the video you're talking about, the green one.

2265
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:16,300
Trying to get my GF into the subject and watch the first minute black last night had some interesting themes in it.

2266
02:20:16,300 --> 02:20:18,300
The first minute black is a fantastic film.

2267
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:20,300
I really want to rewatch that with the lady.

2268
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:22,300
It's a fantastic film.

2269
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:25,300
And guys, I'll get through these questions maybe in about 10 minutes.

2270
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:27,300
I'll have to hop off, but we'll get through all of these.

2271
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:32,300
I promise meeting Bob Dean and after holding Roswell foil and saw pages of a few pages of blue.

2272
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:34,300
But remember who has gone for 20 years.

2273
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:35,300
The foil stretches like a razor.

2274
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:36,300
I cut myself.

2275
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:37,300
I don't remember that.

2276
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:42,300
Now I'd like to hear how, how did you get your hands on, on, on said foil?

2277
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:47,300
And what have there been research done on this specific, specific piece you held?

2278
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,300
What's up, Zach?

2279
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:49,300
How you doing rewatch?

2280
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:50,300
Yes.

2281
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:52,300
I highly recommend starting from beginning right now.

2282
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:57,300
We're just chatting answering questions, but earlier we, we went through the entire gray or talk today.

2283
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:58,300
I bought the pay-per-view.

2284
02:20:58,300 --> 02:20:59,300
So you didn't have to.

2285
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:05,300
And we kind of, I took screenshots of every single PowerPoint slide and we went through the whole dang thing.

2286
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:07,300
The whole thing.

2287
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:09,300
Have you watched the recent weaponized with Corbel?

2288
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:14,300
They discussed an event in 2000 where people were attacked by UFOs that took blood from them and shine beams.

2289
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:15,300
That's not the color.

2290
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:16,300
That's not the Brazil instead.

2291
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,300
Right.

2292
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:21,300
I haven't listened to weaponized in a while, but I would like to listen to that.

2293
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,300
That's Brazil.

2294
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:23,300
Correct.

2295
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:24,300
Yeah.

2296
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:29,300
I haven't, I don't think since the start of the year I've listened and listened to weaponized.

2297
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:30,300
Oh, the turkey video.

2298
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,300
Yeah.

2299
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:37,300
With Chris Leto back in the day, did a great video actually like identifying the angle at

2300
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:40,300
which this video was recorded, the position where it was recorded.

2301
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:41,300
I highly recommend checking that out.

2302
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:43,300
It's an old Chris Leto video.

2303
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:47,300
I think from early 2023 mid 2023, it's fantastic.

2304
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,300
Are they among us like big low suggests?

2305
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:50,300
Quite possibly.

2306
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:54,300
Do I have any research or evidence to back that up or have an informed opinion?

2307
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:55,300
No.

2308
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:59,300
Do not do a video on the clock.

2309
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:01,300
I'd like to, of course it, uh, the clock.

2310
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:05,300
There's a lot of relation to the Kecksburg case in terms of general design.

2311
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:09,300
I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to include that in the Kecksburg case or make

2312
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:13,300
a video on its own about the Glock.

2313
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:16,300
We met photons and radiation, uh, probably into the stratosphere.

2314
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:18,300
Craft would redirect the brain waves.

2315
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:19,300
Possibly.

2316
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:20,300
Sentinel footage.

2317
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:22,300
Um, Chloris Brazil.

2318
02:22:22,300 --> 02:22:23,300
Yeah.

2319
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:24,300
Okay.

2320
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:25,300
Okay.

2321
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:26,300
Yeah.

2322
02:22:26,300 --> 02:22:27,300
Yeah.

2323
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:28,300
Yeah.

2324
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:29,300
Yeah.

2325
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:30,300
I was thinking the same thing, the Chloris Brazil incident.

2326
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,300
And I think that, uh, I got popular again because Lou spoke about it in his book.

2327
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,300
Right.

2328
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:33,300
Um, was it Lou?

2329
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:34,300
I believe so.

2330
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:35,300
It's a great movie.

2331
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:37,300
MIB one, especially when the face opens and the little alien is revealed.

2332
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:38,300
Yeah.

2333
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:39,300
That's a classic.

2334
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:40,300
The tiny little alien MIB ones.

2335
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:41,300
Great.

2336
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:44,300
It scared me really bad when I was a child though.

2337
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:48,300
Jacques Valet and forbidden science for, um, has secured a document confirming the CIA

2338
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:51,300
performed fake alien abductions in Argentina and Brazil for psychological work.

2339
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:53,300
I would really like to see this document if you have that.

2340
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:54,300
I've, I've never seen it.

2341
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:56,300
Um, I'll put the discord link in here again.

2342
02:22:56,300 --> 02:22:59,300
I know I'll put it twice, but I would actually really like to read that document.

2343
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:00,300
Please.

2344
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:02,300
If you have it on hand, otherwise I have a copy of forbidden science for it.

2345
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:03,300
I'll just find it.

2346
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:08,300
They must see in UV light reaction times more like it.

2347
02:23:08,300 --> 02:23:09,300
Let's see.

2348
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:10,300
They're seen.

2349
02:23:10,300 --> 02:23:13,300
Let's see.

2350
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:16,800
What are the consequences of the Collins elite are correct in their findings and the phenomenon

2351
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:18,740
is largely your entirely demonic.

2352
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:21,060
The consequences of that are just awful.

2353
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:27,180
That means we, uh, that mean, I don't even want to face the, the, the consequences of

2354
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:29,340
the UAP phenomenon being a demonic.

2355
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:36,340
That is almost too terrifying for a man like myself to think about, but very, very bad consequences.

2356
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:40,840
If that's the truth, David favor said that he was part of a big upcoming UFO documentary,

2357
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:41,840
not James Fox's.

2358
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:43,340
I have heard that supposedly coming out soon.

2359
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:44,340
And he said it was very interesting.

2360
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:45,640
There was some podcasts with Ryan graves.

2361
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:46,640
I heard that as well.

2362
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:48,740
There's also a Bob Lazar documentary coming out.

2363
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:50,940
Of course the program with James Fox is coming out.

2364
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:55,580
I think everybody in their grandmother is looking forward to that one and Jesse Michaels saw

2365
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:56,740
it.

2366
02:23:56,740 --> 02:24:02,440
So if Jesse Michaels can give me any deets, I can share with you guys, I absolutely will.

2367
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:05,140
Maybe an ongoing YouTube playlist of the best craft videos people have ever captured would

2368
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:06,140
be a cool thing.

2369
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:07,140
That would be cool.

2370
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:08,140
Yeah.

2371
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:10,980
Actually, cause I know I include a lot of craft sightings as B role, but like a full video

2372
02:24:10,980 --> 02:24:11,980
would be great.

2373
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:14,440
I've seen a triangle UAP it's he man made.

2374
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:17,640
What signified that I would actually like to hear that.

2375
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:19,940
Do I watch UAP content or only research it for YouTube?

2376
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:22,180
I do not really watch.

2377
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:23,180
Here's the thing.

2378
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:26,720
I don't watch UAP content because I'm always reading a UAP book.

2379
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:32,460
Every second of every night and day doing the UAP book or just taking a endless amount

2380
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:38,080
of notes on on a sightings or projects I'm working on.

2381
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,140
So it's I need a little bit of a break at that time.

2382
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:41,880
So I don't consume too much UAP content.

2383
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:47,520
I'll I'll watch YouTube for for dumb stuff like maybe some games or stuff like that.

2384
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:51,160
I was at my friend's house after school and Bob Dean was a friend of his.

2385
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:52,160
Wow.

2386
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,160
That's incredible.

2387
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:54,160
That's very cool.

2388
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:56,160
Yo, what up JC?

2389
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:59,200
What up, dude?

2390
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,640
There are metamaterials which go through plasma excitation become room temp semiconductors

2391
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:05,200
on a quantum scale and defy gravity.

2392
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:06,920
I'll join discord and send some links.

2393
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:07,920
Please do.

2394
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:08,920
I'd like to learn more.

2395
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:09,920
If you can help teach me.

2396
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:10,920
Absolutely.

2397
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:11,920
Please.

2398
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:14,720
I'd like to learn and if you're willing to help please William.

2399
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,720
What's up, dude?

2400
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:16,720
You made my day for showing up.

2401
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:17,720
Thanks, man.

2402
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:18,720
Christian Morales.

2403
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:19,720
You missed quite a bit.

2404
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:23,640
I would highly recommend going back to the very beginning of the video because for the

2405
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:29,600
first hour and 20 minutes we talked solely about Greer's presentation today in London.

2406
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:33,040
I took screenshots of everything and we discussed everything in it.

2407
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,800
So there's a lot there to look at.

2408
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,800
Gryffindor Beatles.

2409
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:40,400
There's one of it doing 900 miles and our people might be real sciences.

2410
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:41,400
Interesting.

2411
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:43,760
Cows would call us demonic, right?

2412
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:44,760
Probably.

2413
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:45,760
Yes.

2414
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:51,920
Why do you think Lula as honest as Big Lowe is an American hero when it seems to me he

2415
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:54,560
is doing the exact same thing as the legacy program.

2416
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:56,680
Specifically he takes in all the info and uses it for wealth.

2417
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:58,600
Yeah, that's true, especially with Kona Blue.

2418
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:02,880
Who knows if Big Lowe Aerospace was actually going to share the materials it was supposed

2419
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:06,920
to receive from Lockheed Martin.

2420
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:07,920
I don't know why.

2421
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:13,000
Some of the stuff with the TTSA crew is a little strange to me, especially Big Lowe Aerospace.

2422
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,280
You guys know how Greer gets shepherded by Rand Pandolfi?

2423
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:21,800
I do not and I would like to hear.

2424
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:28,760
Have you ever considered seismic data to quantify triangulate known crash sites?

2425
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:32,800
I have your research, Mr. Floyd, but I have not gone through that yet, but I think that's

2426
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:34,920
a very good route to go down.

2427
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:39,320
I know the current case I'm working on, Kecksburg, has recorded seismic data.

2428
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:43,000
I don't have the actual data, but it was referenced in the Blue Book report on the case.

2429
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,920
So I actually think that's very worthwhile.

2430
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:47,840
That's a great research avenue.

2431
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:50,280
Project Gravitar should be entertaining, aesthetically pleasing if nothing else.

2432
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:55,880
This is the Badozzar documentary with a full VR recreation of the sports model to explore

2433
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:57,880
digitally, which is awesome.

2434
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:59,720
That's going to be really cool.

2435
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:02,920
At what age did you get hooked on the UFO topic and why, since I could read?

2436
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:07,880
I've said this a lot, but ever since I was able to read, I had some UFO sightings books

2437
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:10,080
specifically mentioned of Betty and Barney Hill.

2438
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:15,760
I remember reading about that case from a very young age, and I've just always been incredibly

2439
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:17,960
fascinated with the phenomenon.

2440
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:23,040
Okay, we'll get through these and then in a couple of minutes we'll hit the road gang,

2441
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:26,080
headed to the weird desk after Kit Green, Pandolfi is dangerous and has imitated and

2442
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,240
scared a lot of people.

2443
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:30,600
He shepherds Greer because Greer is so controversial, it helps the gatekeepers.

2444
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:31,600
Interesting.

2445
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,320
I'll have to do some more research on that, absolutely.

2446
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:39,280
One thing that stumps me about the whole triangle being man-made Arabies, why TF are they flying

2447
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,320
them at Low Altitude or Highway so everyone can see it makes no sense?

2448
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:43,880
Yes, that's actually a great question.

2449
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:48,160
So many people who talk about having triangle sightings talk about these being observed

2450
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:52,320
over such low altitudes, hundreds of feet.

2451
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:55,040
In the interest of not wanting to be seen, that seems very strange.

2452
02:27:55,040 --> 02:28:00,760
It's also strange how triangular sightings don't really pop up until the 1950s.

2453
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:08,440
Bob Lazar said the sports model is a Hanoubi MK4, the fastest craft, Lazar don't say Hanoubi.

2454
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,640
I didn't know that.

2455
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:11,880
What do you think of the new Aero director?

2456
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:13,400
I know he's in league with Jay Stratton.

2457
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:21,200
I know he also made some rather silly comments on LinkedIn as his first act of Aero director.

2458
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,880
With Aero, we're not going to get anything different.

2459
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:26,960
It's going to be more of the same, probably.

2460
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:30,000
Gerb said that if the Trump wins, he will release good picks of UFOs.

2461
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,120
I know he said that, but is he going to be able to declassify them?

2462
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:37,840
Chris Mellon, David Grosh, Lousano have all talked about 4K UFO footage presumably taken

2463
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:42,040
from the NRO that is classified and will not be released.

2464
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:45,520
I definitely take that with a grain of salt, but I would love that.

2465
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:47,920
Will I ever make a video about the UFO in your profile picture?

2466
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:50,360
Yes, the Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Saucer sightings?

2467
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:51,360
Yes, I would.

2468
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:57,040
That's probably the one photo set I'd make a video on, just because it's so fascinating.

2469
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:00,160
Big Lowe seems like he hardly cares about disclosure, he has a ton of info, but doesn't

2470
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:01,160
care to reveal what it is.

2471
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:02,160
I agree.

2472
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:08,960
He seems to be more just doing consciousness after death studies and more passion projects.

2473
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:11,440
He doesn't seem well vested in disclosure.

2474
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:15,040
Magic Book was MI5 and MI6.IF.

2475
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:18,240
Does everything go to Royal Air Force bases too?

2476
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:19,240
I don't know.

2477
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:21,240
That's actually a good question.

2478
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:24,880
Besides the witness we talked about in Greer's stuff earlier, BK, I'm actually not familiar

2479
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:30,960
with any UK bases that might be a place in which crash retrievals, biologics maybe, store

2480
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:32,760
it.

2481
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:36,800
I got hooked on the UFO subject when I seen three UFOs flying doing strange maneuvers

2482
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:38,480
in Lithuania in the early 2000s.

2483
02:29:38,480 --> 02:29:39,480
Love the content, keep it up.

2484
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:40,480
Thank you, man.

2485
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,480
Thank you very much.

2486
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:42,400
Three UFOs doing strange maneuvers.

2487
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:43,400
What kind of maneuvers?

2488
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:45,640
That sounds fascinating.

2489
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:46,640
Opinions on Green Street.

2490
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:50,360
We talked about this earlier, and I think I probably talk about this every episode.

2491
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:55,720
I think he has some sort of Department of Defense Pentagon ties.

2492
02:29:55,720 --> 02:30:00,360
He also seems like a guy who got burned that is trying to take revenge on UFO players.

2493
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:06,960
There's something to be said about the fact he includes the phrase spooky alien space monsters

2494
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:09,120
and 8 out of 10 tweets he does.

2495
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:11,120
I'm not the biggest fan of Green Street.

2496
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:17,360
Before 2017, Greer used to always say that one day they'll do a fake disclosure.

2497
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:21,360
They'll start saying UFOs are a threat happening in 2017, happening now in another coincidence.

2498
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:26,160
This probably parallels with the fact that Greer has a huge beef with Lou, which we talked

2499
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:29,920
about a little bit earlier, but yeah, those are probably direct connections.

2500
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:37,360
Tier 3B triangular, but around Hanubi would glow triangle balls with a cube to steer magnets.

2501
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:43,360
Interesting, cube, sort of like the cube within a sphere like Greer speaks about.

2502
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:48,000
A president has no power to bring disclosure because of the Atomic Energy Act.

2503
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:53,520
The app trans classified as foreign nuclear materials, and there's an Obama classification.

2504
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:55,320
I can't remember what classification.

2505
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:58,840
Executive order, I can't remember what it was called.

2506
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:03,720
I'll post it in the Discord, but that there's a mandatory aversion to declassification

2507
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:09,520
with anything dealing with non-human technologies, which could reference NHI or AI or both.

2508
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:12,720
Bigelow isn't about disclosure, but he's seen some disturbing stuff.

2509
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,880
Man, his wife was allegedly killed to the hitchhiker effect.

2510
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:19,120
Interesting, I have not pursued his wife's death.

2511
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:20,560
That is really interesting.

2512
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:22,680
Yeah, the same.

2513
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,480
I had no idea.

2514
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:27,120
I've seen the moon disappear and pop up in a different place.

2515
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:28,120
That is interesting.

2516
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:30,080
Here's the link.

2517
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:30,840
Okay, thank you.

2518
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:32,760
I'll check that out, my man.

2519
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:44,680
My step-granddad posted Magic 12 to MJ12 in the 90s, but book was all black inked.

2520
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:52,760
So your granddad had in hands a Magic 12 book, but that was heavily redacted.

2521
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:53,560
That is interesting.

2522
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:54,440
I would like to hear more.

2523
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,600
You should check out Soccer 96.

2524
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,840
They're super into the topic and have a track with Salami Rose.

2525
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:01,800
Absolutely, that sounds great.

2526
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:05,160
Anybody I can look into more.

2527
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:08,120
Guys, at this point, we will take some time to sign off.

2528
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:10,000
We've been doing this for about two and a half hours.

2529
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:15,160
Like I said, we'll be doing a stream of just about every Sunday, maybe every Monday.

2530
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:18,720
Whenever there's a big event like this, Greer stuff, I will always kind of use the

2531
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:23,680
live to cover it, do that for a video for a live instead of just kind of research

2532
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:27,000
because I like my videos to be huge research projects.

2533
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:32,080
And with that, guys, yeah, with that big low statement about his wife, if anybody's

2534
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:34,400
in the Discord, we'll continue to talk about it there.

2535
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:37,480
With that, guys, I want to say I really appreciate the support on the channel.

2536
02:32:37,480 --> 02:32:40,640
Thank you guys so much for showing up, watching this to our live stream.

2537
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:44,760
I know Kai, I know something or someone have kind of been here since the very start.

2538
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:49,840
So I really appreciate everyone being here and expect a new video this week.

2539
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:51,000
I'm hoping to get it done.

2540
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:54,320
I was hoping to get it done today, but it might be Wednesday.

2541
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:57,120
We get it out just because it got some stuff going on with Jesse.

2542
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:58,880
It's going to be a bit of a busy week.

2543
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,640
So we'll get that video out and then some some other stuff in the work.

2544
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:05,280
Thank you guys all so much for showing up to the stream and I will catch everybody later.

2545
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:06,480
All right, see you guys.
