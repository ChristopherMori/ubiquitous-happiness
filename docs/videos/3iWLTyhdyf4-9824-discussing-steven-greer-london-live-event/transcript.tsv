0	7000	Yo, yo, let me see if we are live.
7000	10000	I can never get this right, can I?
10000	11000	Live.
11000	12000	All right.
12000	13000	What's up, everybody?
13000	14000	What up, Colin from Dubai?
14000	16000	How you doing, man?
16000	18000	Oh, what up, John?
18000	19000	John, Mr. Pico Graham.
19000	21000	Hey, tell Jones to stop ducking Aspenall.
21000	24000	I'm sick and tired of it.
24000	27000	We're going to let some more people filter in.
27000	30000	I'm trying to kick a pretty foul mood at the moment.
30000	33000	If you guys don't know, I'm a big American football fan
33000	37000	and my team, the Cincinnati Bengals, just got smoked to a dreadful team.
37000	41000	So we're just going to be, and I spent four and a half hours this morning
41000	42000	watching Greer.
42000	44000	So it's just been a strange day.
44000	46000	Well, we'll get through it.
46000	49000	Got a cold brew.
49000	52000	What are you guys up to, anyone?
52000	54000	Do anything fun this weekend?
54000	55000	Got anything going on?
55000	57000	Let me adjust my lighting a little bit.
57000	61000	And the lecture was really interesting.
61000	66000	I have notes on every single aspect of the entire four hours.
66000	69000	So we're going to go through it kind of line by line.
69000	72000	I have screenshots from the entire thing,
72000	75000	and I kind of want to break down each of the PowerPoint slides
75000	76000	and tricks in my hand.
76000	78000	Any advice for new content creators?
78000	80000	I am still a new content creator,
80000	85000	and it's just kind of figuring it out as you go.
85000	87000	I don't know if there's any answer, man.
87000	90000	I still don't know what the heck I'm doing, to be honest.
90000	91000	Watching NFL?
91000	92000	Yeah.
92000	94000	Yeah, let's...
94000	95000	I hate the sport.
95000	98000	I hate football, but I'll be watching next week.
98000	99000	What up, Alexander?
99000	101000	How you doing, man?
101000	103000	Jones will never fight.
103000	105000	I know, and he's ducking him,
105000	109000	because John Jones knows he'd get smoked and knocked out in the first.
110000	113000	You went to a seven-hour general assembly of a political party.
113000	115000	You got in a word, hey, that's awesome, man,
115000	117000	for what subject, representing, or...
117000	119000	That's really cool.
119000	120000	Greetings from Germany.
120000	121000	Hey, what's up, man?
121000	125000	I've only been to Frankfurt in Germany, and I loved it.
125000	127000	Four and a half hours with Greer is enough to sour anyone's day.
127000	130000	Well, when we get into it, it'll probably be really interesting to you.
130000	134000	The presentation was split up into halves.
134000	138000	So the first half of the webinar was talking all about,
138000	143000	you know, the program, black programs, black sites that Greer wanted to discuss.
143000	149000	And the entire second half was about kind of new age stuff, consciousness, and so forth.
149000	150000	But we got all the slides.
150000	151000	We'll go through everything.
151000	153000	Soon 10K, I hope.
153000	156000	So, Gluten, you got the flu, dude?
156000	157000	What happened?
157000	158000	I feel like you're...
158000	159000	This is my friend, Gluten.
159000	162000	I feel like you're ill just about every week.
162000	164000	So I don't...
164000	166000	I hope you're all right.
166000	167000	Doing great.
167000	168000	Love your deep dives.
168000	169000	Thank you.
169000	170000	I appreciate that.
170000	172000	We got one coming out soon this week, very soon.
172000	173000	Hello from Canada.
173000	174000	What's up, dude?
174000	175000	What part of Canada?
175000	176000	Two lives.
176000	177000	I did.
177000	180000	I promised everybody we'd be doing one live a week.
180000	183000	And I intend to keep that promise.
183000	185000	Just a general memory till...
185000	186000	That's awesome.
186000	187000	And you're from Iceland, correct?
187000	189000	I love it.
189000	190000	Wilder side.
190000	191000	What's up, dude?
191000	192000	Hello from Dubai.
192000	193000	Event Horizon.
193000	194000	What's up?
194000	196000	If you guys don't know Event Horizon, this is John Michael Goode.
196000	199000	And his wonderful producer, Ross, I highly...
199000	203000	I mean, I'm sure you guys know about John's channel and the Event Horizon podcast.
203000	206000	Both of these men are excellent individuals.
206000	210000	And I can't wait to be talking about him more in the future.
210000	213000	If you guys don't know Event Horizon, go watch any episode.
213000	218000	Any of John Michael Goode's videos on the Fermi Paradox are instant classics.
218000	219000	And I highly recommend them.
219000	224000	John is a huge inspiration for my channel in terms of just how he treats every video
224000	225000	almost like a research paper.
225000	229000	It doesn't have any BS, kind of just the facts approach.
229000	233000	Not really slick editing to kind of trick people with clickbait or anything like that,
233000	236000	but just stick straight to discussing the topic.
236000	238000	I love John Michael Goode.
238000	239000	All right.
239000	243000	Living in Malta near the border, British Columbia.
243000	244000	That's awesome.
244000	246000	I love it in the private party.
246000	247000	That's awesome, man.
247000	248000	Congrats.
248000	250000	Originally from Arkansas, living in Malta.
250000	252000	Oh, thank you so much, Rod.
252000	253000	I know you.
253000	254000	I really appreciate it.
254000	255000	Skip the matinee.
255000	256000	What were you seeing?
256000	257000	Alien, Beetlejuice.
257000	259000	I don't know what else is out at the moment.
259000	261000	Event Horizon does rock.
261000	263000	John Michael Goode rocks.
263000	264000	Absolutely is awesome.
264000	266000	6 a.m. or where are you?
266000	269000	Are you in Asia or Hawaii?
269000	273000	I was trying to do this one a little bit earlier so we could get some of the EU fellers
273000	276000	and especially because this program had to do with London.
276000	278000	Thank you, Ross and John.
278000	279000	I will talk to you guys soon.
279000	280000	I appreciate that, man.
280000	282000	Really appreciate it.
282000	285000	Have I ever seen Janet's YouTube channel?
285000	287000	Very interesting, clear footage of UAPs.
287000	291000	I've heard of the channel, but I haven't sat through and watched a ton of the videos.
291000	292000	I will have to though.
292000	298000	There's just so much to analyze lately without even touching footage.
298000	301000	Recently, I talked to John and Ross from Event Horizon.
301000	304000	That's something that all of us are on the same page on.
304000	311000	A lot of the times, footage is useful or useless for furthering the conversation.
312000	313000	Thanks, Ross.
313000	314000	I appreciate that, man.
314000	315000	Thank you very much.
315000	316000	Much love.
316000	317000	Thank you for the support.
317000	318000	It's awesome.
318000	319000	Greetings from the UK.
319000	320000	Yes.
320000	321000	Okay.
321000	322000	Perfect.
322000	324000	I wanted some of my friends from across the pond in here.
324000	326000	That's wonderful.
326000	329000	Can you do a video where you analyze Green Street and other skeptics claims?
329000	330000	Absolutely.
330000	331000	I'd love to.
331000	333000	Green Street is a strange one.
333000	336000	There's something that makes me irrationally angry whenever I see a tweet of his because
336000	343000	I know it has an 8 out of 10 probability of containing the words alien space monster
343000	346000	or spooky aliens or something like that.
346000	349000	That sounds great.
349000	353000	Green Street, maybe a little bit more Sean Kirkpatrick work, I think would be excellent.
353000	354000	Absolutely.
354000	355000	Way to kick off the week.
355000	356000	Thank you, Django.
356000	358000	My mom's dog's name is Django.
358000	360000	Nice to see you, new subscriber.
360000	361000	Thank you very much, man.
361000	362000	I really appreciate that.
362000	365000	First video, when you get it, feel free to drop the link.
365000	367000	I'd love to watch it.
367000	374000	How about we get started with the, yes, Green Street does have DOD ties.
374000	375000	He does.
375000	377000	Oh, Norway Oslo here, man.
377000	379000	I was just in Oslo last September.
379000	380000	My girlfriend is Norwegian.
380000	381000	I loved it.
381000	382000	I can get the link.
382000	384000	Yes, please, brother.
384000	387000	Let's start with Steven Greer's event.
387000	392000	This wasn't nearly as publicized as something like the 2023 National Press Club event.
393000	395000	I'm not exactly sure why.
395000	400000	I know Greer put a lot of effort into kind of getting a lot of attention towards that.
400000	403000	This was done in London.
403000	408000	A bit strange as there were different tiers to kind of witness the event.
408000	410000	The webinar itself was $50.
410000	416000	It was really weird, but there was also a $75 in-person ticket to go see.
416000	419000	She know if you're watching that, let me hear how it was.
419000	424000	And then you could pay $1,500 for a meet and greet with Steven Greer.
424000	429000	Like a dinner because the way the event went from three to seven o'clock London time was
429000	433000	Steven Greer's lecture and webinar, he says, and workshop.
433000	434000	There was no workshop.
434000	438000	There was no worksheets, but this was split into two distinct tabs as I'll kind of get to.
438000	443000	After that, there was a dinner with Steven Greer and then a premiere of the lost century,
443000	445000	Steven Greer's newest documentary.
445000	452000	I think that is free to stream on Peacock maybe or it's free to stream on some service.
452000	453000	I recommend watching it.
453000	457000	I know it features a lot of artwork by Michael Schrat and I really respect Michael Schrat
457000	458000	and love his work.
458000	462000	And I still do think any of Greer's work is worth watching and then kind of analyzing
462000	464000	and dissecting from there.
464000	465000	Let's get through these.
465000	472000	Do you think Steven Greer tries to bring forth any actual whistleblowers?
472000	474000	In this event, no.
474000	477000	He only talks about mostly whistleblowers.
477000	478000	We know.
478000	483000	In fact, Steven Greer had himself a viewing of a UFO witness list and decided to reiterate
483000	484000	some of that.
484000	490000	But I think right now he's on the warpath of trying to kind of to identify these black
490000	494000	operation sites, two of which he mentioned in the video.
494000	495000	And we'll go through those.
495000	498000	I'll pull up the exact actually three of them he mentioned in the video.
498000	500000	I got exact coordinates to all of them.
500000	505000	So we'll kind of go through there and keep going.
505000	507000	Gluten, some swag would be legit.
507000	508000	I would like that.
508000	511000	I'd like to do some black stuff with some just stitched logos on there.
511000	513000	It's free on rumble.
513000	514000	It's free on rumble.
514000	515000	So I recommend watching that.
515000	518000	I recommend watching unacknowledged.
518000	520000	Just anything by Greer is worth a watch.
520000	523000	The production value on his documentaries are generally very high.
523000	527000	And it's still good to, yeah, cult leader.
527000	531000	A lot of this conference was about CE five.
531000	532000	I remember.
532000	537000	So for my discord, I had live notes in there just kind of telling everybody what was going
537000	539000	on with screenshots and stuff like that.
539000	545000	And Greer would go on like 25 minute diatribes talking about like his near death experience
545000	548000	at 17 or a lucid dream of the future.
548000	552000	And that's fine and dandy, but to spend, you know, a significant amount of time in a workshop
552000	554000	where people are paying money to go see.
554000	558000	I'm a little bit, uh, I'm a little bit, uh, not huge on that.
558000	560000	So let's start.
560000	563000	I'm going to share my screen and we'll just kind of go through things a bit slowly as people
563000	567000	start to trickle in because there is some really interesting stuff Greer talked about
567000	569000	and some interesting connections as well.
569000	573000	So I need to remember how the heck to share my screen.
573000	577000	Cinema layout presents.
577000	581000	Share screen.
582000	585000	Tire screen.
585000	586000	Okay, cool.
586000	587000	Yeah.
587000	589000	So let's see what everybody's saying.
589000	591000	Um, Greer.
591000	592000	Yes.
592000	593000	Exactly.
593000	597000	Greer should not be ignored, although he is controversial for anyone saying, please try
597000	598000	CE five.
598000	599000	Uh, you want to understand it?
599000	600000	I would like to understand it.
600000	602000	I still have not tried CE five.
602000	606000	Greer says he has, uh, tutorials on how to do such a thing.
606000	612000	But, uh, you know, it's why not explore it and then kind of, uh, come up with a conclusion
612000	613000	there.
613000	617000	But so some of the things Greer talked about in this was, uh, uh, talking about new top
617000	618000	secret witness testimony.
618000	620000	He didn't really reference any new top secret testimony.
620000	622000	We'll go through everybody he did talk about.
622000	625000	You'll know some familiar players from my channel.
625000	627000	He references Michael Herrera.
627000	631000	He references TB, which I thought was in somewhat of strange taste.
631000	634000	He went, uh, mentions MS.
635000	637000	Uh, witness, TE or ET.
637000	641000	I can't remember in which direction in the disclosure project archives.
641000	642000	It's 10, eight, nine, two.
642000	646000	The guy who discussed a fake abductions and programmable life forms will kind of touch
646000	651000	into, uh, besides that, um, Greer posts two images of blacks.
651000	652000	I T visited from last year.
652000	656000	Neither of these images he posted are from his actual visit.
656000	657000	One of them is from Google Earth.
657000	663000	Another one is a ripoff of one of my images, which was kind of funny to see, uh,
663000	665000	meetings between Dr. Greer and key members of Congress.
665000	667000	We have a couple of notes on that.
667000	670000	So let's, um, let's start going through things.
670000	672000	So I have, uh, power.
672000	676000	I have screenshots of every single slide that Greer had.
676000	677000	I'm just going to get all these.
677000	679000	We'll go one by one.
679000	680000	Sorry.
680000	681000	What the heck?
681000	683000	My bad guys.
683000	684000	Okay.
684000	685000	Yeah.
685000	690000	So for, uh, Greer's first, he gave a little kind of preamble when he was talking about
690000	692000	serious disclosure and so forth.
692000	697000	Greer states that his first CE five attempt occurred in 1992 in England at the height
697000	698000	of crop circles.
698000	703000	Greer claimed that his initial CE five event led to a crop circle that inspired his CE
703000	705000	five logo, which is this.
705000	712000	So Greer stated that, um, he summoned a UAP craft, eat this crop circle with this design
712000	713000	appeared.
713000	715000	And then he saw a large saucer like design in a field.
715000	716000	That was new to me.
716000	721000	I know Greer kind of states that since he was like 18, he even said this in the, uh,
721000	725000	presentation that he had kind of figured out how the universe works, which I find a
725000	726000	little bit egotistical.
726000	727000	I'm not going to lie.
727000	731000	Even if a CE five has some real practices to it, I don't think it's very humble to
731000	734000	state you understand how the universe works as a 17 year old man.
734000	737000	But this is how kind of serious disclosure and so forth came to be.
737000	744000	So his initial slide, some of the points he wanted to talk about were, um, he approached
744000	749000	this sort of webinar as kind of like a kindergarten level briefing for individuals.
749000	753000	He kept saying in the first couple of slides that, you know, whoever watches this, it's
753000	755000	going to absolutely blow your mind.
755000	757000	Like you're going to be crying when you leave this year.
757000	760000	You're not going to really be able to understand what you just saw.
760000	765000	And to be honest, there wasn't too much like new information here.
765000	770000	There's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss, but there wasn't a lot of really new, um,
770000	771000	information.
771000	776000	So something that Greer does state on these first couple of slides is when, when he was
776000	786000	young, a gatekeeper to the program who tried to kind of not really buy Greer off, but to,
786000	788000	um, but intimidated Greer.
788000	792000	So Greer said that Major Albert Stubblebine was this individual.
792000	798000	Stubblebine has mentioned multiple times in the witness list.
798000	805000	So sorry, spell check.
805000	810000	So Greer has a witness, 10, 5, 9, 9, who worked with Major Stubblebine for four years, has
810000	813000	documents, recording interviews and others to back up his claims.
813000	817000	I've found no, none of those documents in the DP archive.
817000	824000	Uh, he also taught Greer has a witness, 10192 of an ex remote viewer under Stubblebine,
824000	825000	um, and so forth.
825000	828000	But here is a really interesting witness guys.
828000	829000	Uh, check this out.
829000	830000	610658.
830000	832000	I noticed this a lot.
832000	835000	I noticed this a lot earlier when I was kind of reading through the DPR.
835000	837000	I cried the first time.
837000	839000	So Greer has a witness 10658.
839000	844000	He says that this witness has been involved in the sixties, former head of Fort Huachuca.
844000	845000	I hope I'm saying that right.
845000	846000	And if I'm not, I'm sorry.
846000	850000	Fort Huachuca, army intelligence where ET craft and body are stored.
850000	854000	He says this because later when Greer posts his facility list, he talks about Fort Huachuca
854000	856000	being a really kind of key facility.
856000	859000	Well guys, now here's what's interesting.
859000	860000	Okay.
860000	865000	So major Albert Stubblebine Greer says this person intimidated him.
865000	871000	Let's go to look at the, um, let's look at the army intelligence center in school at
871000	873000	Fort Huachuca, Arizona.
873000	878000	So this is the Fort Huachuca who was in charge of, sorry, let me back up for a second.
878000	882000	When Greer talks about Fort Huachuca, which we'll address later in the video, he says
882000	888000	that the person he spoke to ran a Fort Huachuca and discussed ET craft and ET bodies in the
888000	889000	1970s.
889000	890000	Okay.
890000	891000	So check this out.
891000	896000	Brigadier General Eugene Kelly Jr. took command of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center in school
896000	898000	at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.
898000	901000	This was in the year 1975.
901000	904000	But this is rather interesting.
904000	910000	In 1977 at Fort Huachuca, he relinquished his command to General Albert Stubblebine.
910000	915000	So Stubblebine could very well be this witness right here, 10658, somebody who has been involved
915000	920000	with the 60s, former head of Fort Huachuca Army Intelligence where ET craft and bodies
920000	921000	are stored.
921000	925000	When later in the video we'll talk about Greer referencing a source at Fort Huachuca who
925000	928000	worked there in the 70s to talk about ET craft and bodies.
928000	934000	But this is also somewhat at odds with Greer's original statement that Stubble, Stubblebine
934000	936000	specifically tried to intimidate him.
936000	942000	But I would have a high bet here that this is probably General Albert Stubblebine.
943000	948000	So Greer states he was approached by insiders when he was a 30, when he was in his 30s.
948000	953000	He labeled these guys as white hats or good guys or blue team as we'll discuss earlier.
953000	958000	If you remember from the majestic video, kind of blue team, red team, these are often labeled
958000	960000	to be UFO craft retrieval operators.
960000	963000	So don't get that confused as we talk about blue team guys.
963000	967000	These are going to be guys that Greer states are black program insiders who are kind of
967000	971000	good guys who want the truth to come out.
971000	975000	People Greer states were sent to him because top brass in the Pentagon weren't read into
975000	977000	the UFO situation.
977000	982000	Greer makes a direct mention to briefing Admiral Thomas Wilson, which of course is now really
982000	986000	interesting with Eric Davis confirming the Wilson Davis notes.
986000	991000	But he also talks about him briefing the CIA director in the early 90s.
991000	996000	And I know this is a contentious point about Greer briefing the CIA director.
996000	999000	I believe he states he sat down and briefed the director.
999000	1003000	And I believe the counter argument to that is Greer just blasted out an email to the CIA
1003000	1006000	director who just kind of read it and threw it in the bin.
1006000	1011000	So I'm not sure if that conversation has advanced very much.
1011000	1013000	Stubblebind died in 2017.
1013000	1014000	Yeah.
1014000	1015000	He's no longer with us.
1015000	1018000	So we can't be contacted here.
1018000	1024000	And Greer says a lot of this kind of contact about good guys, white hats, blue team in the
1024000	1030000	air who contacted him wanting to kind of restore oversight to black programs was under the Clinton
1030000	1031000	administration.
1031000	1039000	So this for me is a new line of research to head down kind of what went on under the Clinton
1039000	1040000	administration.
1040000	1045000	So let's go on to slide two.
1045000	1046000	Sorry.
1046000	1047000	Sorry.
1047000	1048000	Wrong window.
1048000	1051000	Let's go on to slide two.
1052000	1058000	Here Greer talks about how if you guys remember the 2001 disclosure briefing document, I highly recommend it.
1058000	1060000	Let me pull it up.
1060000	1065000	If you guys have never read this document, it is brilliant.
1065000	1068000	It's it's Greer's best piece of work.
1068000	1069000	And I will always stand by that.
1069000	1071000	This is fantastic.
1071000	1078000	But Greer states he was asked to make his disclosure briefing document in order to brief Senate intelligence and the
1078000	1079000	armed services staff.
1079000	1082000	So this would have been in the early, mid to late nineties.
1082000	1088000	Greer states he was contacted by the most senior person, a staff for Senate of the gang of eight.
1088000	1094000	And this member of the gang of eight and his senior staff are kind of knocked on the doors internally in the
1094000	1097000	Department of Defense and the Pentagon, but were denied.
1097000	1104000	So Greer also states he was brought in a skiff, but didn't need clearance.
1104000	1113000	Because his DPR DPI archive had more actionable intelligence and information than the intelligence community on UAP.
1113000	1117000	So that was pretty, that was pretty interesting to me.
1117000	1121000	Greer was then approached kind of earlier in the 2020s into a skiff.
1121000	1126000	He said he brought the Trump presidential briefing document to a skiff.
1126000	1133000	We know that Lou Elizondo and Ross Colt Hart have stated that Trump has brought in a skiff.
1133000	1138000	Trump has been somewhat, if not fully briefed into the UAP situation.
1138000	1140000	I still haven't really researched that.
1140000	1142000	So I don't really have an opinion.
1142000	1146000	Greer likes to add in these little details to kind of add drama.
1146000	1148000	It's great showsmanship actually.
1148000	1150000	It kind of really engages the audience.
1150000	1154000	He says in this specific meeting there was a bourbon bottle in the middle of the table.
1154000	1158000	Within 10 minutes, the intelligence guys were desperately reaching for the bottle.
1158000	1161000	It's just a little bit of unnecessary fluff.
1161000	1167000	Greer states he has been in skiffs multiple times, each with top secret, secret, compartmentalized intelligence.
1167000	1174000	Clearance folks who were all astonished at how long Stephen Greer has been doing this, pushing for disclosure.
1174000	1180000	So Greer now kind of talks about this law enforcement update.
1180000	1183000	And this is where things get really interesting guys.
1183000	1190000	So if you're kind of halfway paying attention, I would lock in here because this is a little bit of new stuff from Greer.
1190000	1194000	Greer states he is in contact with top tactical operations people.
1194000	1201000	These are Green Berets, SEALs, JSOC people who are all coming together behind closed doors to support Greer.
1201000	1209000	All these commanders, these current tactical operations officers are seeking briefings from Greer.
1209000	1216000	They have been asked by somebody, not sure because Greer doesn't devolved to bring black projects back under congressional oversight.
1216000	1224000	So in summary, Greer's stating that a lot of JSOC leaders are being asked to bring the program back under control and moving with Greer.
1224000	1226000	This is very interesting.
1226000	1239000	Greer says, and I quote, that there are plans or possible plans to quote unquote, roll on dugway proving grounds, Area 51, Edwards Air Force Base and other black sites.
1239000	1240000	Roll on.
1240000	1242000	He says, take them back.
1242000	1253000	If taking these sites back involves any sort of force or a legal entry or brute force entry, does this not egregiously violate OPSEC?
1253000	1266000	Because I think what Greer is referring to is by force taking back these sites that he says are under black project control because Greer also goes on to state that black program leaders dwarf Hitler and the Nazis,
1266000	1272000	which, you know, that's always never a in great taste.
1272000	1278000	Yes, he has mentioned this before on kind of podcast before about forcibly enter entering these sites.
1278000	1283000	But I don't think he's fully pieced everything together with kind of who he's talking to in order to do that.
1283000	1285000	But I could absolutely be wrong.
1285000	1289000	For the SAP whistleblower protection Greer has been talking about.
1289000	1300000	Since June, 2024, Greer has been tasked and with others for providing OPSEC for whistleblowers, 762 of these according to Greer.
1300000	1308000	These cover individual for all firsthand individuals according to Greer, people who are there when craft were shot down, reverse engineered, etc.
1308000	1313000	The program is operational for US whistleblowers only with his show in.
1313000	1314000	It could be wrong.
1314000	1316000	I very well could be wrong.
1316000	1324000	We're talking about Greer's project today, his speech in London, his event there.
1324000	1325000	There was a webinar.
1325000	1329000	There was an in it kind of in person show I bought the pay per view.
1329000	1332000	So we're talking about that.
1332000	1333000	Florian, thank you very much.
1333000	1334000	I really appreciate that.
1334000	1336000	Thank you very much.
1336000	1338000	He might have talked about it on Sean Ryan.
1338000	1339000	He might have.
1339000	1341000	I got to listen to that again.
1341000	1348000	But yeah, Greer does suck at OPSEC something will continue to talk about today.
1348000	1353000	So yeah, so this this program Greer States is for US whistleblowers only.
1353000	1355000	He's trying to get something set up in the UK.
1355000	1358000	He basically asks for funding and backing there.
1358000	1366000	And this is a special access program to protect firsthand whistleblowers from presumably threats on their life.
1366000	1370000	Greer talks about deep cover defectors.
1370000	1374000	And he addresses this in parallel to catastrophic disclosure.
1374000	1381000	He states there's a group currently with performing operations within black projects who are trapped within the system.
1381000	1392000	Greer States is trying to work with these people to kind of, you know, bring these black operations back under congressional oversight or possibly roll on them if that needs be.
1392000	1400000	Greer also goes on to talk about how after his viewing of a dumb entrance, which we'll talk about soon, he was almost killed.
1400000	1403000	This is a gross exaggeration.
1403000	1405000	He fell.
1405000	1407000	He fell off his bike.
1407000	1411000	So yeah.
1411000	1415000	So sorry, let me let me get through a couple of comments here.
1415000	1421000	Let's see Greer sucks at OPSEC got my PC admitting he I'd like to see that if you would like to post that.
1421000	1423000	As well.
1423000	1425000	Lazar was used for soft disclosure.
1425000	1428000	Get the attention of Harry Reid.
1428000	1430000	He was 23 and an eccentric.
1430000	1434000	Interesting.
1434000	1436000	Yes, I have that's that's also great.
1436000	1439000	I think that's kind of making the news rounds of late.
1439000	1441000	Very interesting.
1441000	1447000	So Greer likes to state that 90% of what is known in ufology is disinformation.
1447000	1454000	He states he has the 10% that is considered real information included in the 90%.
1454000	1458000	This is a slide from the presentation is that we don't have man made UFOs.
1458000	1465000	This is a point kind of I have really sort of changed my position on in the past few months.
1465000	1474000	The alien threat interdimensional phenomena, which is weird because Greer will later on in the second half of this presentation talk about internet interdimensional phenomena.
1475000	1478000	ETs are demons, abductions, weapons in space.
1478000	1486000	When the truth and we'll kind of get into this in the second half as well is really kind of new age woo stuff.
1486000	1493000	If you if you guys know what that is about kind of raising consciousness, vibrations, stuff like that.
1493000	1496000	See, peaceful CE5 contact enlightenment, universal peace.
1496000	1497000	And I'm not saying there's nothing to that.
1497000	1503000	I just think it's a I always think it's interesting when people claim to have all the answers when Greer says that 90% of what's known in ufology.
1504000	1508000	Is disinformation, but his 10% is the true information.
1510000	1513000	Greer talks about DPI archive.
1513000	1517000	He says that it will take years for people to sift through all the information.
1517000	1519000	That's just demonstrably untrue.
1519000	1521000	We can sit through the info here.
1521000	1523000	Of course, we have 13 sections here.
1523000	1530000	Greer says he has a 14th session here that he can't wait to talk about and post on the site.
1530000	1532000	So I'm really excited to see that.
1533000	1534000	Or thank you so much.
1534000	1536000	I really appreciate that.
1536000	1540000	Starbucks is extremely, extremely expensive.
1540000	1542000	Consciousness is the key to all of this.
1542000	1543000	I absolutely agree.
1543000	1549000	There's there's much of kind of human cognition, human consciousness in terms of the UAP phenomena.
1549000	1557000	I just find it a little bit strange when Greer says that his 10 he is the one who holds 10% of the true information.
1558000	1566000	So Greer, and now is when we'll kind of go into a little bit of the discussion of some of the whistleblowers and witnesses he talks to.
1566000	1574000	Something I took special note of, which I found kind of funny is Greer talks about the pages and pages, the 23 pages of redacted witnesses.
1574000	1578000	But Greer says he likes to honor the whistleblowers request for confidentiality.
1578000	1584000	Anybody who's seen any of my videos will know that's just his operational security is absolutely dreadful.
1584000	1592000	So next we'll start talking about illegal operations, locations, corporations based on intel from his witnesses.
1592000	1596000	You guys know the Greer facility list.
1596000	1602000	If you don't let me pull that up facilities maps and list.
1602000	1608000	So Greer has all of these facilities, including maps pointing towards them.
1608000	1610000	Sorry, that looks nice and reversed colors.
1610000	1614000	All of these are garnered from the pages of witness testimony here.
1614000	1619000	For example, you know, we can look at Dugway Proving Grounds as given by MS.
1619000	1627000	We can go over here to a little place in Indiana where we might know a spot and so on.
1627000	1635000	But and so Greer talks about now the first dumb entrance to which he was taken to.
1635000	1643000	This is he states is the anthill in the eastern desert of California or western desert of Nevada.
1643000	1653000	Let me pull up with this place is called because I actually found it and I need to.
1653000	1655000	Sorry guys just give me a second here.
1655000	1664000	I need to find out exactly what this place is called again.
1664000	1672000	So I can get you guys exact exact locations.
1672000	1680000	Greer states this location that we're talking about is basically an entrance to a dumb or a deep underground military base.
1680000	1684000	If you can go online, you can find this exact place.
1684000	1687000	Sorry guys.
1687000	1693000	It's what's known as a volcanic cinder cone like volcano offshoots.
1693000	1698000	Greer stating this is a dumb entrance and let me pull up the exact place.
1698000	1699000	Sorry.
1699000	1701000	I forgot what this place is is called.
1701000	1703000	Is it called the Salt Lake?
1703000	1704000	Yes.
1704000	1705000	Okay.
1705000	1707000	Got it.
1707000	1712000	If you want to find this place on Google Maps, this is called the Salt Lake Cinder Cone.
1712000	1713000	Okay.
1713000	1720000	This is the exact entrance that Greer is stating is a dumb entrance right here the Salt Lake Cinder Cone.
1720000	1722000	I can get a nice zoom in.
1722000	1724000	This, as I said, is a cinder cone.
1724000	1728000	We can look by because these generally occur near volcanic activity.
1728000	1734000	And I think there's a volcano located about 25 miles or so northeast of this location.
1734000	1736000	I'm not sure if these are other cinder cones.
1736000	1740000	I'm not a rock specialist, but this location right here.
1740000	1744000	I don't understand where the entrance here is.
1744000	1752000	If anything, this possibly could be dirt moved for underground locations, but I don't know where an entrance could be in this location.
1752000	1755000	Let me say a couple, thank you guys real fast.
1755000	1758000	And we got the next location to talk about a little something to somewhere.
1758000	1759000	Thank you very much.
1759000	1760000	Tell us and thank you for the boost too.
1760000	1762000	I really appreciate that.
1762000	1763000	Maglevs connecting all the DUNS.
1763000	1769000	Yes, we will talk about that too because Greer touches on it.
1769000	1770000	Sorry.
1770000	1773000	My questions are, are you familiar with Northrop Ant Hill?
1773000	1774000	Yeah.
1774000	1777000	Greer calls this Northrop Ant Hill, I think.
1777000	1782000	I'm actually, because he calls this the Ant Hill as a DUM.
1782000	1789000	So he calls this, yeah, as we can see the Ant Hill.
1789000	1790000	Sorry.
1790000	1791000	Okay.
1791000	1793000	Crackerjack, thank you very much.
1793000	1794000	Greer stones.
1794000	1795000	I turn over.
1795000	1802000	Greer does awesome work and he, I still recommend checking out all of his documentaries and kind
1802000	1805000	of paying attention to what he says because it's very interesting.
1805000	1808000	So you guys will probably know this site.
1808000	1814000	Next, Greer talks about the Hellendale site, the Lockheed Martin Hellendale site.
1814000	1823000	Now what's really interesting here guys is let's get back to the DPI archive.
1824000	1836000	So if we go to UFO kind of secret related facilities, top priority documents and so forth with some photos of stuff.
1836000	1840000	A Hellendale location, there used to be multiple images on here.
1840000	1845000	So I'm not quite sure why Hellendale was taken off of the DPI archive.
1845000	1850000	And I can also state for a fact that within the presentation today, Greer didn't mention Hellendale.
1850000	1854000	So I don't know, I really don't understand what the play here was.
1854000	1862000	I don't know who this is attempting to kind of confuse or fool, especially because people in my discord, as I post this live, there was a user.
1862000	1863000	It's really smart guy.
1863000	1864000	His name is rectified.
1864000	1867000	He knew he said immediately, hey, this is Hellendale.
1867000	1869000	And I'm sure multiple people recognize it as well.
1869000	1877000	So within the presentation, Greer stated that he didn't say the name Hellendale and the images of Hellendale have been stripped off the DPI archive.
1878000	1885000	But he Greer states that this director of black operations took him to this Hellendale site.
1885000	1891000	He says that this Hellendale plant is a staging ground for electro gravitic ARV or alien reproduction vehicle.
1891000	1893000	I'll be saying ARV the rest of the time.
1893000	1900000	The diamonds here on the runway Greer states are for using kind of scalar technologies.
1901000	1912000	So scalar technologies to kind of test human made ARVs and their resilience to kind of EMP weaponry or to bring down ET craft.
1912000	1920000	Greer states that I think one to two craft are brought down by this site in particular, maybe all sites a year.
1920000	1927000	He also brings up an image of this site at the Hellendale plant says this is EMP weaponry.
1927000	1937000	And that the EMPs are used in conjunction with scalar technology to knock out craft a year that this site has been operational for black program duties for upwards of 40 years.
1939000	1951000	The person the black operations director who flew him over this Greer states in this presentation that this same individual has personally been present at ET craft shoot down and personally recovered craft and bodies.
1951000	1953000	So real fast Florian, thank you so much.
1953000	1956000	I really appreciate the euros from Germany.
1956000	1958000	Have you seen above majestic I have.
1958000	1964000	What is your take about alien human bases on the mood and Antarctica and space travel for decades now.
1964000	1976000	There's a lot of really interesting kind of witnesses in the DPI archive specifically about UFO and NHI signatures on the moon and I would like to explore those further.
1976000	1978000	I don't think they're out of the realm of possibility.
1978000	1984000	I just think that that specific topic needs a lot of a lot more hard nose research, a lot more hard nose research.
1984000	1990000	So next, as you guys know from the facilities list.
1990000	1996000	Greer has a list of numerous, numerous, numerous, numerous facilities.
1996000	2004000	Most if not all of these guys have been referenced in the DPI archive.
2004000	2006000	Sorry, I'm the 2001 disclosure briefing document.
2006000	2010000	See here, China Lake.
2010000	2016000	I'm in that place.
2016000	2020000	So I don't think much has changed on this facility list.
2020000	2022000	Greer also talked about this in a 2016 speech.
2022000	2028000	I have referenced quite a bit, including my work on Doug way.
2028000	2044000	I mean, this is I haven't fully taken a look yet, but this is just copied verbatim since 2001 or I think 1996 is when this specific place was or this specific list was compiled for the DPI archive.
2044000	2046000	So we'll keep going.
2046000	2048000	Sorry, I'm just kind of trying to organize my notes.
2048000	2054000	A lot of the times my notes are sloppy are pretty sloppy.
2054000	2056000	Continuing on with the sites.
2056000	2060000	Oh, yeah, yeah, Greer made specific reference here.
2060000	2066000	Very specific reference here is about the Los Alamos National Labs.
2066000	2076000	I know you guys have probably all heard of Los Alamos National Labs, but he talks about a maglev system under Los Alamos connecting it to other dumb locations.
2076000	2084000	He states, I don't know how he got this intel, but he states that Los Alamos has direct access to Kirtland AFB and Dulce.
2084000	2094000	I can never, you guys know, I don't know how to speak, but Greer likes to kind of claim here that any above ground duties about the Dulce base are completely false.
2094000	2096000	And this is just one large below ground dumb.
2096000	2098000	There's a lot of interesting work on this.
2098000	2102000	I can't remember exactly what the pieces right now that I've talked before UFO highway.
2102000	2106000	It might be called, which is a good PDF that talks about the Dulce location.
2106000	2118000	Greer says that this Dulce place is where it contains biotech labs where fake ETS, aka PLF programmable life forms are made.
2118000	2124000	Interesting to me as well Greer state specifically that some of these dumps were built in the 1980s.
2125000	2133000	At least in my research, I feel like I've seen plenty of discussion that dumps have come come around a little bit before that.
2133000	2141000	But I do want to bring something up about, sorry, I do want to bring something up about in the DPR archive.
2141000	2153000	I seem to have ex exed out of that tab, but Greer has some patents for a huge boring underground boring machine that he states was used for kind of building these maglev systems.
2153000	2157000	Creating the deep underground military bases.
2157000	2158000	Yes, it is.
2158000	2160000	This is Jack Ramanson's gym.
2160000	2162000	I love repping this gym.
2162000	2163000	Awesome gym.
2163000	2165000	Okay, look, keep going here.
2165000	2173000	And now at this time because Greer has multiple pages he talks about in terms of underground bases that we already have listed on that primary site.
2173000	2175000	Sorry, trying to pull this up.
2175000	2177000	He again talks about Fort Hachuca.
2177000	2192000	And again, I will reference that I believe that the witness 10658 in the DPR archive is really major Albert Stubblebine, which conflicts of Stephen Greer's earlier claims that Stubblebine tried to intimidate and create fear within Stephen Greer.
2192000	2196000	Interesting reference here about Pine Gap underground facility in Australia.
2196000	2201000	He says this is a transnational majestic location.
2201000	2203000	Doesn't say majestic 12 just as majestic.
2203000	2206000	Now, I do know of an intelligence guy.
2206000	2211000	He's a friend of mine who says he has been to Pine Gap and didn't see anything there doesn't think anything could be there.
2211000	2215000	But then again, I don't think he was given access to the entire facility.
2215000	2219000	Mention of Doug way proving grounds outside here will go.
2219000	2232000	Okay, so when I interviewed MS, I think I gave very vague directions to the entrance that he claimed was for the Doug way dumb.
2232000	2235000	I just said it was near German village in Utah.
2235000	2236000	Greer gives.
2236000	2239000	In fact, he gets my pin for this place.
2239000	2249000	So I can give you guys that exact location to and because Greer has kind of violated this upset here.
2249000	2252000	Greer talks about UFO related facilities and companies here.
2252000	2256000	I don't think anything really new is going to stand out here.
2256000	2262000	He adds kind of in the he has talked about this in his 2016 briefing.
2262000	2270000	I think this is what he added that SAIC is a crown jewel here because in the same presentation he mentions.
2270000	2285000	Sorry, he also mentions I talked about her in my NSWC video with RA about the testimony of Denise McKenzie, a former SAIC employee who would talk about
2285000	2289000	being large contracts with nothing actually on the books.
2289000	2293000	So next we move on to a witness.
2293000	2297000	I actually hadn't seen and this can be pretty interesting.
2297000	2310000	So Greer talks about project mannequin in 1997, a top secret underground based genetic engineering PLFs, please in P'smore UK under witness BK.
2310000	2313000	And you guys know that I will give you the exact witness name.
2313000	2322000	Well, this isn't one, but this is somebody connected to this witness BK witness 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive.
2322000	2326000	Again, that's 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive.
2326000	2331000	And here's the witness 10 412.
2331000	2337000	This is the witness that Greer is stating has information on PLFs and an underground dumb in the UK.
2337000	2349000	So project mannequin at RAF P'smore has seen and touched gray beans bred in NSA underground base evidence of military committing abductions globally.
2349000	2353000	So in the DPI archive.
2353000	2357000	10 412.
2357000	2360000	We won't go through all these documents right now.
2360000	2363000	But under 10 412 this individual BK.
2363000	2376000	There's quite a bit of interesting documents to research, including some alleged actual documents smuggled out of this project mannequin, which is presumably to make PLFs.
2376000	2389000	According to this individual, there are also sketches from this individual BK about the creation of PLFs, the manufacturing of like a classic gray and so forth.
2390000	2400000	And that this project mannequin is also in charge of making what we would think of as the classic reptilian design along with the grays.
2400000	2405000	I think project came a lot interviewed the piece more winners. I haven't seen that I'll absolutely have to check that out.
2405000	2412000	So, and now this will be one that kind of me close some of these tabs guys. Sorry.
2412000	2419000	Let me close some of these tabs. Greer then gets into the infamous TV.
2419000	2422000	So, out of respect.
2422000	2427000	I am not going to talk about who TV might be or his name.
2427000	2431000	I understand that's definitely out there.
2431000	2438000	And people know about this individual or might know, but so I'm not going to bring that up, but there's plenty about there.
2438000	2454000	So, initially, this Lawton, Oklahoma case with TV, this is in reference to some statements by TV to Stephen Greer in which some technology was leveraged from this crash that was used at Fort Sill, Oklahoma base in 2003,
2454000	2463000	where General John M. Riggs showed off classified cloaking technology to a BAE systems employee, where he was then unceremoniously retired.
2463000	2475000	Now, the kernels of truth in this statement are that General John M. Riggs was in fact demoted a star upon his retirement and sent basically to the basement of the Pentagon and handed in his clothes and said,
2475000	2483000	you're gone. So, he was very unceremoniously retired and according to I think it's a Baltimore Sun article. This was for improper use of contractors.
2483000	2494000	So, I think I have these in my video with TV, but Greer just kind of posts some images of kind of the crash retrieval that occurred in Lawton according to TV.
2494000	2502000	He also posts this ARV looks very, I don't think this is actually in reference to an ARV according to Greer, but posts a craft in an underground facility.
2502000	2516000	What we would probably know as Mark McCandless is Fluxliner ARV. Fluxliner, if you know that name, Greer also at the end of the project says that the Fluxliner name was actually used for Lockheed's first generation of ARV craft.
2516000	2528000	I didn't know this because this wasn't provided in the notes with TV, but apparently this location right here is an underground base actually in Oklahoma near Fort Sill.
2528000	2542000	So, that might be a location to look at Fort Sill, the Lawton area for any sort of bases down there. Greer also states that some craft shot down break into pieces while others have sort of a controlled landing due to being stunned.
2542000	2558000	This has more relevance to the infographics whistleblower when he's talking about eggs and bells, bells being the most commonly crashed craft and that the vast majority of the time they almost disintegrate break into pieces or basically melt away like nothing is there.
2558000	2572000	So, that's an interesting connection there. Greer dropped some specific terminology when he was talking about this location when we get a sip of cold brew.
2572000	2588000	He states that retrieved NHI living bodies are not referred to as extraterrestrials. They are kind of referred to as evens, extraterrestrial biological entities as you know but with an N on the end.
2588000	2596000	But these individuals that are taken alive are called captives or refugees and those are the exact words but used by Greer.
2596000	2612000	Next on to Mr. MS, we know him very well. So, at this point covering a TB and MS back to back we got a little UFOs witness list action going on which you know I always like to see.
2612000	2620000	Greer talks a little bit more and gives a little bit more insight apparently because apparently he has some more connections and things to study about the craft that MS saw.
2620000	2628000	If you guys remember from that video MS stated to have seen like a basically inverted cone triangle section at the bottom of the craft.
2629000	2637000	New drawing here from Greer's archives. I wonder if this is a shrap drawing if it is that's great Michael Schratz the best.
2637000	2646000	But Greer states to have some insight on this on the pyramid we talked about which we kind of I don't really remember if I hypothesized about it.
2646000	2657000	But Greer stated that he kind of knew factually that this inverted pyramid is an EMP crystalline structure that causes objects to basically travel instantaneously.
2657000	2664000	It likens the abilities of this piece to like a astral projection functionality.
2664000	2681000	This is a good question why are all these people talking to Greer instead of Congress could they be doing the latter in secret they absolutely could remember we talked about TB and his witnesses in his messages to Greer here was summoned to testify before members of the gang of eight including Marco Rubio in 2022.
2682000	2696000	Yeah whistleblower protection is terrible remember guys the witness or whistleblower protection doesn't cover pensions so that was something that Greer had stated kind of in media about specifically TB that he was afraid for both his life and his pension.
2696000	2703000	So even with these whistleblower acts your pension is not covered and love these guys with families and stuff this is presumably what they're worried about.
2704000	2709000	Okay MS Dugway render we know this from the video.
2709000	2713000	We know this from the video group post some images.
2713000	2716000	These look these look a little familiar to me.
2716000	2725000	But so let's go to the exact entrance.
2725000	2729000	German village in am I going to Utah I don't know if I'm going to Utah.
2729000	2732000	Well before I get to that.
2732000	2751000	Group post an untitled place mark changing the colors of a plate of a mark that could only be me but so the Greer posted this on the DPI archive okay I'm just going to show that once again in his recent updates.
2752000	2754000	It was in.
2754000	2762000	Wow, I guess he just took that off really recently.
2762000	2765000	Okay.
2765000	2779000	Last time I checked this in the critical updates Greer had posted image for the anthill and the Dugway site in Greer's presentation he posts this image for the Dugway location.
2779000	2787000	And let me try and find it.
2787000	2790000	Dugway German village.
2790000	2798000	I got to remember my exact location now here guys.
2798000	2803000	Let me think.
2803000	2808000	Let me I got to think about the exact coordinates here.
2808000	2814000	Oh man this might be tough a little bit south of Dugway German village.
2814000	2817000	We might be we're on the money.
2817000	2822000	This is the location he provided.
2822000	2836000	This is allegedly the entrance to the dumb right here according to what Greer posted in his September 8 2024 London press conference right.
2836000	2839000	Just a bit northwest of Dugway German village.
2839000	2848000	So I was a little interested to see him post that, but especially if he is talking about taking back such sites.
2848000	2850000	I found that a little interesting.
2850000	2858000	But now we can talk a little bit about a witness we talked about a little bit last week in the Greer archive about programmable life forms and so forth.
2858000	2860000	This is witness TE.
2860000	2865000	If you want to follow along in the DPI archive you can search witness 10892.
2865000	2870000	Again that's 10892 and find relevant documents.
2870000	2874000	German village. Where is German village.
2874000	2876000	Just search Dugway German village.
2876000	2883000	Right here.
2883000	2890000	Dugway German village. Just a little bit northwest of this location.
2890000	2896000	So, yeah, it talks about TE. This is a witness we talked a little bit about last week.
2896000	2905000	And the story of TE is this individual approach Greer claimed to be on a specialized ARV retrieval team.
2905000	2912000	Some artwork included here. I think this might be Rudy Garcia and some of Greer's team this artwork is really cool.
2912000	2921000	This kind of triangle site is man made craft as you can see by the no step.
2921000	2929000	This must be work by Michael Schrat, but it's a kind of a CAD drawing of this same device, the same craft.
2929000	2939000	And eventually at some point this witness TE 10892 graduated from kind of ARV retrieval and was promoted to ET retrieval.
2939000	2944000	So this event occurred and I can't remember what year this was. I know it's listed in the archive.
2944000	2947000	This might have been 2004.
2947000	2955000	Early 2000s where a sunflower type craft what crashed near or not crashed I'm sorry landed near Nellis.
2955000	2961000	As you can see Greer also make specific mention to this ARV that was privy to this retrieval operation.
2961000	2965000	If you can see here there's some soldiers lying in wait.
2965000	2976000	This witness TE stated that as individuals approach this craft basically autonomy was taken away from all the soldiers and they were sent into basically like a stunned state.
2976000	2982000	Out of this what you would see as a fruit roll up craft came some ETS that looked like this.
2982000	2986000	And this is must be a Rudy Garcia drawing excellent drawing.
2986000	3002000	And so forth this witness TE was really disturbed by this exact operation because he found these ETS and they're kind of emerald blue eyes is so peaceful and kind of pure that he thought what the retrieval teams and shooting down craft were doing was sick.
3002000	3006000	So he tried to basically defect and leave the retrieval force.
3006000	3014000	Greer states that this individuals uncle who grandfathered him into the program was the only one who stopped this individual from being killed.
3014000	3027000	Upon his release TE was targeted with a fake abduction where he was approached by these creatures and basically took brute force to them and found circuitry and so forth within.
3027000	3039000	So next we'll go to the next witness talked about some of you guys might know this person some of you might not I have actually been trying to get in contact with Shannon Lee for a while.
3039000	3059000	Shannon Lee is a witness who claimed to I can't 2008 2009 off the coast of I think it was Guam while in the Navy or the Coast Guard participated in a saucer retrieval from the ocean where a craft was almost tangled in the Japanese fisherman's net.
3059000	3062000	And this was in conjunction with the US Marines.
3062000	3066000	So again I've been trying to contact this guy for months.
3066000	3068000	Here's the image of the retrieval operation.
3068000	3071000	He actually did an interview with Steven Greer.
3071000	3073000	I can't remember if it's on the DPI archive or not.
3073000	3082000	I'll actually try to find it and post it but the actual video was taken off of Greer's was taken off of Greer's YouTube page.
3082000	3090000	And I think this was maybe because I think Mr Lee suffered maybe from some social anxiety or something because the interview was just a little bit awkward.
3090000	3103000	It was just a little disconjointed and stuff but I've always found this interview extremely interesting because according to Lee this craft was so heavy it almost toppled the Navy craft as it was lifted up in its net.
3103000	3119000	Greer stated and Shannon Lee states that this artwork right here is a little bit off the craft was had no seams kind of no pathways just a really solid seamless craft and he tried to take a sharp object to it and to no effect.
3119000	3121000	To no effect.
3121000	3127000	So upon returning Shannon Lee was forced to sign numerous NDAs and so forth.
3127000	3132000	And you guys might know this individual from the disclosure from the National Press Club conference.
3132000	3134000	He was very sickly.
3134000	3136000	He looked it looked really.
3136000	3140000	I don't know if it was from his encounter or from just health.
3140000	3144000	I think he mentioned he had a brain injury but Steven Digna.
3144000	3154000	In his testimony before kind of an abduction case he talks about being on a bombing range where he was with two Raytheon employees where they saw a large boomerang shaped craft.
3154000	3160000	And I believe one if not both of these craft yes Greer talked about this was a projection.
3160000	3177000	And here is a little bit where Greer dove into kind of the project blue beam kind of fear mongering stuff he talks about these projection techniques you know if you see a craft over London they can produce numerous craft and kind of fake an invasion and so forth.
3177000	3187000	But this was apparently a Raytheon craft that had entered into the bombing range for clandestine purposes I don't know for whatever purposes it seems strange to do that over an active bombing range and yes.
3187000	3195000	Steven Digna was suffering a brain injury I wish him peace he looked like he was suffering quite a bit from there.
3195000	3205000	So Greer stated here as well that anti gravity technology in which this Raytheon craft was based off of was mastered in October of 1954.
3205000	3206000	Sorry.
3206000	3209000	Next of course.
3209000	3211000	Greer talks briefly about Michael.
3211000	3214000	We all know Michael from this channel.
3214000	3219000	He shows the video made by Star Labs of the octagonal craft.
3219000	3228000	We've all seen these so I'm not going to waste space or so forth but Greer had one new detail about Michael story that I wasn't aware of.
3228000	3233000	And I'll certainly bring it up to Michael Greer thinks this craft was Lockheed skunk works or EG and G.
3233000	3238000	Why I don't know exactly why he thinks that.
3238000	3243000	But that is what Greer states here he doesn't expand on that anymore he just kind of moves on.
3243000	3252000	Greer states the initial misconceptions of him and thinking this was kind of drug smuggling operations of course I've talked about Michael initially thought when he saw this was drugs.
3252000	3258000	Greer kind of assumed also Greer has talked to witnesses who state that ARVs are used for smuggling drugs.
3258000	3265000	One of these witnesses I think his files were removed from the DPI archive I think it was witnessed.
3265000	3270000	Sorry let me I'll look this up.
3270000	3273000	Let me see if I got it right.
3273000	3276000	Yes, 10329 right here in the DPI archive.
3276000	3283000	I think his files were taken down, but witness 10329 right here.
3283000	3291000	Worked in deep black projects as knowledge of advanced crafting connections to drug running knows of two sites near Nashville Tennessee where craft have been seen landing.
3291000	3299000	Same locations were used by the CIA slash 160 if that's an Air Force division locations are private airship and another in a valley between mountains.
3299000	3307000	So I've talked a little bit to this person I will talk to them again and you know if there's some interesting stories to make.
3307000	3310000	I will absolutely make them real quick scallions.
3310000	3311000	I love you.
3311000	3313000	Thank you so much for your support.
3313000	3318000	I really really really appreciate it really appreciate it.
3318000	3328000	Yeah, here kind of with most of these stories guys Greer will talk about the witness will talk about what's going on and then kind of round it back to himself like.
3328000	3337000	Greer was talking about Michael and then states that after the 2023 NPC that his YouTube was hacked and demonetized and.
3337000	3357000	That just wasn't a necessary addition to me but Greer then talks what I talked about in my interview with Michael that the insider who spoke to Michael was at the NPC 2023 and exact quote from Greer that this insider said to him quote.
3357000	3369000	That is worse than your Marine guy thinks it is end quote you guys know I like those quote end quote this individual the insider that Michael has spoken to claim to have been part of this operation.
3369000	3371000	And then.
3372000	3386000	As you'll know this from Michael's testimony Greer starts talking about P3 psionic predisposed I can't remember exactly what pre P3 stands for at the moment my brain is going a mile per minute, but he talks about kind of P3 assets a little bit and if you guys.
3387000	3394000	Remember this from Michael story and then Ross cult her Ross Colt heart talking about consciousness and so forth.
3394000	3409000	But these individuals are basically used to interact with with ET craft recovered craft, or I think in some cases as Greer likes to stay kind of lower craft in.
3409000	3419000	Consciousness technology and P3 operator technology hijacking of ET craft target and bring them down or take control of them.
3419000	3426000	Greer states that this is a theme. This is a this was a very strange slide to me guys.
3426000	3436000	I found it strange that Greer brought in hand dominance and preference and individuals into accountability for psy abilities.
3436000	3438000	I wasn't.
3438000	3445000	I certainly have never heard that anywhere and I have not heard that I probably won't hear that again.
3445000	3455000	But Greer states that most of these P3 assets these people who are tasked with in kind of interacting with ET craft with their consciousness connection most die.
3455000	3465000	Those who cannot do the work are used as forced laborers and maintenance in side the facilities and some are now defecting to disclosure project.
3465000	3468000	I would like to hear a little bit more about that.
3468000	3477000	And at this time, Greer mentioned a base in the Chihuahua Desert used to house P3s.
3477000	3490000	This is a reference to the sentinels of ethers kind of dops or play written by Michael or ghost written by Michael's insider that he's contacted, which talks about we talked about this all last week 2004.
3490000	3494000	What we can now assume is a Lockheed Martin recovery team wiping out a JSOC team.
3494000	3499000	The differences in sentinels of ether involves trafficking P3 assets in John Stewart source.
3499000	3503000	It involves tracking it down to craft.
3503000	3516000	So then Greer went for quite a while on a story about a dream he had when he was around 18 and knew the structures of the cosmos.
3516000	3522000	This was about this was a while kind of leading after discussing Michael and P3s.
3522000	3537000	And this, of course, Greer reiterates that at some unknown time he was approached and offered $2 billion to kind of hush up in defect, not really defect, not really joined black programs, but to stop talking and stop working on the DPA archive.
3537000	3540000	I think he's discussed this quite a little bit.
3540000	3543000	Of course, at this time, this is obviously very powerful for Greer.
3543000	3545000	He got pretty emotional at this time.
3545000	3553000	And I can understand that, especially working on such such kind of huge stuff in his life, you spent so much time doing this.
3553000	3562000	But, you know, I can sometimes I have trouble separating, you know, maybe some of this stuff is sympathy plays for Greer when he talks about himself so much, kind of getting emotional about that.
3562000	3564000	But who knows who knows.
3564000	3568000	So at this point we had an intermission, I think it was about 30 minutes.
3568000	3577000	And when we come back from the break, most things were focused on kind of consciousness and so forth.
3577000	3592000	So Greer kind of breaks down what he states is the UFO phenomenon it's broke down between ET interdimensional beings and classified black programs usaps and basically human reverse engineer technology.
3593000	3595000	I'll leave this up for a couple seconds.
3595000	3601000	But Greer likes to distinguish the fact or distinguish between ET craft and the DPI archive.
3601000	3603000	The guy has poured his entire life into this.
3603000	3605000	Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
3605000	3609000	Greer has put decades, decades, decades.
3609000	3611000	Stubblebind was the one who offered him $2 billion.
3611000	3612000	Has he said that before?
3612000	3613000	I might just be messing out actually.
3613000	3615000	That's interesting.
3615000	3616000	For some reason it doesn't.
3616000	3618000	Is there a link that's not working?
3618000	3619000	Tell us that.
3619000	3621000	If there's a link that's not working.
3621000	3625000	I thought this was a really interesting here guys.
3625000	3633000	Look under the classified unacknowledged special access programs you'll see holographic man made beings from thought forms.
3633000	3645000	Now if you guys know anything about like old, I can't even think to where this practice begins, but topos like a thought forms that manifest conscious beings.
3646000	3648000	I'm just, that's a lot.
3648000	3658000	That's a huge thing to put into a PowerPoint without really expanding on it further, especially saying that Lockheed skunk works essentially manifest topos.
3658000	3674000	So, yeah, so, yeah, so Greer talks about that both the extraterrestrial and ultra dimensional hypothesis of non human intelligence is through that both of these exist on our planet.
3674000	3676000	They're just differentiated.
3676000	3696000	Most of what we can see as physical craft are in fact ET or ARV alien reproduction vehicles human made and Greer states that the vast majority of sightings of UFO, especially in today's age are actually ARV technology human made technology and not not real kind of ET craft.
3696000	3710000	A lot of the ultra terrestrial stuff is kind of what you hear a little bit more about attached with woo in the phenomena, kind of floating orbs the poltergeist phenomena and so forth.
3711000	3726000	A lot of this talk kind of dove into a little bit more of the kind of woo stuff discussing a lot of physics talk with quantum thrown in here and there to kind of make things sound a little bit more mysterious.
3726000	3732000	We referenced the show stranger things as a description of summoning ultra terrestrial beings.
3732000	3746000	This reminds me very closely of Alex Jones claims of of of of individuals high up in clandestine government operations who will take a bunch of DMT and then go talk to spirit programs.
3746000	3754000	Next, Greer, sorry.
3754000	3767000	And this time, Greer kind of discuss started to really get into kind of the consciousness aspect of of UAP, a lot of talk about kind of new age concepts like light beings and stuff.
3767000	3776000	Some of the interesting stuff that Greer discusses is that human programs and abilities are now very close and comparable to what ET technology has.
3776000	3779000	And this is very interesting to me.
3779000	3788000	Especially when you think about kind of analyze witness testimony of human made ARVs the possibility they work on electrogroupics like the TR3B and so forth.
3788000	3803000	I, it's really interesting to think about if human capabilities are near ET and the implications of that are that would mean that human these black programs have unrestricted use of basically surrounding basically unrestricted use of our solar system and other space
3803000	3807000	time, what kind of operations are they getting up to and so forth is a very interesting question.
3807000	3811000	And that Greer likes to state that humans are now an existential threat to ET.
3811000	3817000	Part of this is because Greer states the technologies ET extraterrestrials use are non local.
3817000	3828000	A lot of these technologies require a craft being or technology to basically remove itself from 3D space time entered folds between dimensional space and pop up elsewhere.
3828000	3837000	And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second.
3837000	3840000	Yeah, the the holographic consciousness universe.
3840000	3843000	This stuff at least I know this interests a lot of people.
3843000	3844000	That's why of course I'll put it up here.
3844000	3846000	It's not as big as my focus.
3846000	3849000	You guys know it's reverse engineering and crash retrieval.
3849000	3854000	So I might be a little not as knowledgeable on this topic here.
3854000	3859000	So if I sound ignorant or I'm just kind of skipping through stuff that you find really interesting.
3859000	3860000	That's my bad.
3860000	3868000	I'm just not as well versed on on such topics quickly Greer really kind of leaned into remote view.
3868000	3870000	Sorry, wrong tab.
3870000	3877000	Greer really leaned into remote viewing at this point and went on for a couple minutes about how he himself can levitate.
3877000	3880000	That was that I think is a bit a bit.
3880000	3886000	That's a bit of a stretch for me in terms of saying you can levitate and so forth.
3886000	3891000	I don't really see how that fits into this discussion even when speaking about consciousness and so forth.
3891000	3901000	But we'll keep going because I want to get to Greer had Greer posted what he thinks of as his own Kardashev scale guys.
3901000	3903000	So you guys know the Kardashev scale.
3903000	3907000	It's a ranking of basically civilizations throughout the cosmos.
3907000	3911000	Humanity is what's known as like a level like 0.7 on the Kardashev scale.
3911000	3916000	A level one Kardashev scale is able to harness the entire energy output of its host planet.
3916000	3921000	A type two Kardashev scale is able to harness the total energy output of its host son.
3921000	3927000	And a level three Kardashev civilization is able to harness the entire energy output of its home galaxy.
3927000	3931000	There are kind of more expansions on on this and different breakdowns.
3931000	3936000	But Greer states that current human civilization is consumed by war.
3936000	3940000	It's very primitive environmental technologies and it's plagued by extinction level events.
3940000	3942000	A global peaceful civilization.
3942000	3948000	And I think this is Greer's ultimate goal to leave us lead us towards especially when you look at the lost century.
3948000	3956000	His next video in which he really push is for kind of the the utilization of zero point energy and technologies that have been obfuscated.
3956000	3959000	And hidden with E.T. reverse engineering.
3959000	3964000	I'm just laughing at Mr. Mosilli's comments were zero.
3964000	3967000	Yeah, that's funny to me.
3967000	3973000	And a permanent P.I. I think this is a great point by Kai Greer magically assumes that humans are going to magically start loving each other.
3973000	3977000	And if we know NHI and advanced technology is real, yes, I disagree.
3977000	3980000	I think he I think a lot of that is he.
3981000	3989000	Arrest that on claims of like Ronald Reagan and his speech where he says I can't think of how fast humanity would come together if we face like an alien threat and so forth.
3989000	3990000	I agree.
3990000	3995000	I don't think that can be utilized to solely bring humanity together.
3995000	4007000	But a permanent P civilization develops trans dimensional technologies when you read that trans dimensional technologies just know that that's what I discussed when Greer says that a lot of these E.T. technologies are non local that they require the
4007000	4016000	Utilizer of the technology to basically leave our current space time travel through dimensional folds reengaged another point of space time.
4016000	4018000	The pursuit of science and consciousness.
4018000	4026000	Okay, we can go to but the the weird thing about this guys is Greer only posted to two of four of these slides.
4026000	4028000	Greer says there's four levels of civilization.
4028000	4031000	He only posted two slides.
4031000	4032000	You can see two of four here.
4032000	4035000	He only posted the slide before in this one.
4035000	4041000	So that was pretty funny to me the level three and interstellar civilization clear to travel to other star systems.
4041000	4047000	However, if humans have ability similar to E.T. now, could we not feasibly travel to other star systems as well.
4047000	4055000	Development of widespread establishment of science of consciousness pursuit of higher states of consciousness early integration into other interstellar civilizations.
4055000	4063000	I do think the pursuit of consciousness needs to be integrated into a kind of us a level zero current current human civilization as well.
4063000	4070000	I think consciousness study is a is integral to the human experience, especially how it relates to UAP technology.
4070000	4073000	That is not something that should be overlooked.
4073000	4077000	It's still a concept that I'm can be quite unfamiliar with and quite uncomfortable with sometimes.
4077000	4084000	It's still really new to me concepts like P3 concepts like remote viewing consciousness studies still very new to that subject.
4084000	4092000	So if I'm ever ignorant towards it, that's why I'm still learning a level four cosmic consciousness civilization above 1% of something.
4092000	4097000	Senior ambassadors are enlightened in cosmic consciousness contact with other advanced civilizations.
4097000	4101000	However, wouldn't a level three interstellar civilization be able to do the same?
4101000	4112000	But according to this same log, if a cosmic consciousness civilization can provide guidance to emerging civilizations, would a level zero civilization such as humanity not be a emerging civilization?
4112000	4123000	Or would we need to be a level one or two a global peaceful civilization global peaceful civilization to receive contact and level five part of the senior interstellar collective.
4123000	4126000	My question to Greer is where is he getting this information?
4126000	4128000	What is he basing this off of?
4128000	4137000	I would I would really like to know because it's really interesting to me of enlightenment widespread and accelerated experience or innate.
4138000	4140000	I don't know what that word means.
4140000	4143000	I'm sorry guys technology parallel states of consciousness.
4143000	4150000	So Greer talks about some CE five stuff now.
4150000	4152000	And he posted a lot of images.
4152000	4157000	Most were just kind of vague shapes, not much to him.
4157000	4159000	He posted two images.
4159000	4161000	Sorry wrong.
4161000	4166000	He posted two images where actual forms can be seen from CE five contact.
4166000	4174000	I took a special note of right here, but I need to shout out a dude in my discord right when I posted this.
4174000	4177000	The same gentleman rectified he posted.
4177000	4180000	Let me pull this up.
4180000	4191000	This image right here on the right rectified posted that this was actually a sighting in Twitter in in Chile, sitting on Twitter in Chile.
4191000	4196000	And as far as rectified knows, Greer is not associated with this sighting at all.
4196000	4202000	So why why post this if it's not yours, man?
4202000	4206000	Most of Greer's photos you can see a lot of CE five stuff on the DPI archive.
4206000	4209000	The vast majority of them are lights in the sky.
4209000	4211000	I'm totally not.
4211000	4213000	I'm not totally closed off to CE five.
4213000	4218000	I just haven't seen evidence for it, you know, especially when it comes to the images.
4218000	4222000	It's just sort of really vague light forms.
4222000	4226000	So of course, there's there's not much I can kind of study off of that.
4226000	4228000	But I'd like to see more.
4228000	4237000	So interesting to me, I'm sure you guys have all heard of a lot of the stuff that Jason Sands has been talking about that.
4237000	4248000	John Ramirez talked about that Lou has talked about that that Jeremy Corbell and George not kind of like to dangle in front of you a date, a deadline, right?
4248000	4253000	When I say that most people probably think of 2027 as a sort of deadline.
4253000	4255000	I think it's associated with Jason Sands.
4255000	4263000	He overheard he states he overheard communications between NHI and humans or NHI and NHI saying they want their stuff back.
4263000	4268000	Greer made specific mention of the timeframe 2025 to 2030.
4268000	4272000	Quote, if we haven't corrected this problem, it will be corrected for us.
4272000	4288000	Greer states this is the worst case scenario that our mastery of ET technologies are a threat due to the fact these are non local technologies are harnessing and misuse of these technologies are affecting other solar systems.
4288000	4296000	And fixing this thing for us would be a correction to protect other worlds, life on earth and life elsewhere.
4296000	4301000	And that statement is kind of where Greer left the event.
4301000	4307000	Of course, then there was an ovation and everybody clapped and left.
4307000	4313000	So that was the that was the entire Greer catalog of his show today in London.
4313000	4320000	And now that that's over, we can go through kind of if you have questions about the event questions about anything, let's go through them.
4320000	4321000	We'll talk about the whole thing.
4321000	4327000	If there's anything that stood out to you, we'll go through one by one and you guys know how I do.
4327000	4330000	If there's any question, I will absolutely answer it.
4330000	4332000	So we'll start going through those.
4332000	4334000	Whoa, this is really over lit.
4334000	4335000	How about that?
4335000	4336000	It's really over lit.
4336000	4337000	Sorry about that, guys.
4337000	4339000	I don't know if that's better.
4339000	4343000	So let's see.
4343000	4345000	I'm going to leave it on.
4345000	4349000	The main issue with Greer is he does not distinguish between what he knows due to evidence and what he is speculating on.
4349000	4352000	He's pretty much in his own category among UAP sources.
4352000	4359000	Yeah, I think it's crucial to for people when they're speculating to make sure that it's clear that they're speculating.
4359000	4368000	I think this is what got like Jason Sands and a bit of trouble out the gate because he would just kind of ramble on about scenarios and ideas
4368000	4372000	and wouldn't really kind of nail down and specify when he's saying, hey, I'm speculating.
4372000	4374000	I don't know this for sure.
4374000	4383000	I think with a lot of these witnesses in Greer's archive, I'm not sure to the extent to which he has vetted every single one of these sources.
4383000	4391000	So when he claims he has 762 whistleblowers, this is pretty much every name redacted or unredacted on the log.
4391000	4395000	A lot of these names that he states are under whistleblower protection.
4395000	4398000	A lot of these are labeled as like UFO researchers.
4398000	4401000	For example, you guys know I'm working on the Kexpert case.
4401000	4406000	Stan Gordon is listed in there as a UFO researcher in point of contact to Kexpert witnesses.
4406000	4408000	Does he need to be offered?
4408000	4411000	If you guys don't know Stan Gordon, he was the primary Kexpert researcher.
4411000	4415000	Did he need to be offered whistleblower protection?
4415000	4423000	There's also a lot of the I feel like with the witness list and the facilities map.
4423000	4429000	Greer was happy to beef up the content over quality of the content, right?
4429000	4430000	I bet you can see what I'm saying.
4430000	4438000	For each email he received, somebody making claims, it's easy to redact the email, redact the name, throw it on the DPI archive to say, hey, here's another witness.
4438000	4442000	Look what they're saying now and so forth.
4442000	4444000	Hey, Flying Lotus, what's up dude?
4444000	4447000	Flying Lotus, if you guys don't know his music, Flying Lotus is awesome.
4447000	4453000	I recommend checking out the Black Balloon reprise with Denzel Curry and Never Catch Me with Kendrick Lamar.
4453000	4455000	Flying Lotus is great.
4455000	4457000	What do I think about Richard Doty?
4457000	4459000	I don't think he can be trusted.
4459000	4465000	I think anything that Doty kind of connects his name to, it's almost impossible to get to the bottom of.
4465000	4476000	All you have to do is look at Tobinowitz and his claims in a career's documentary Unacknowledged where he talks about the, I think it's the Roswell, yeah, the Roswell incident being some Russian dwarves,
4476000	4478000	disfigured Russian dwarves and so forth.
4478000	4486000	So I tend to stay away from Doty as much as I possibly can.
4486000	4488000	What are your thoughts on Sans?
4488000	4490000	Truthfully, I don't buy it at all, but would like to get your thoughts.
4490000	4496000	I'm remaining agnostic to Sans until I get a chance to kind of speak to him direct.
4496000	4504000	I know a lot of people, not a lot, I'd say I know about six people in the intelligence community and all of them, while they can't verify Sans' claims,
4504000	4508000	they all speak very highly of him as an individual.
4508000	4510000	So I find that interesting.
4510000	4516000	Now, all these people that speak highly of him as an individual agree that the method in which he came forward was awful.
4516000	4522000	You know, on Twitter spaces and to just engage with a lot of the Twitter drama and so forth.
4522000	4526000	And I've heard that that's just kind of the type of guy Sans is.
4526000	4528000	He just wants to get that information out there.
4528000	4530000	He's got a great and kind heart.
4530000	4534000	He knows him directly, speaks incredibly highly of him.
4534000	4536000	So if I get a chance to speak to him, I'd like to.
4536000	4540000	Until then, I'll probably just remain a little agnostic towards his case.
4540000	4542000	I do not trust Greer.
4542000	4544000	He's a shifty.
4544000	4548000	I'll say it just like I've said a thousand times.
4548000	4554000	Greer has brought forth so much great witnesses and documents and stuff to study.
4554000	4556000	And then disclosure briefing document from 2001.
4556000	4560000	I will swear by it is the best piece of literature.
4560000	4562000	If one of the best pieces of literature on the UFO subject.
4562000	4566000	Now, I agree with what Kai said earlier that Greer tries to make himself the center of everything.
4566000	4570000	This was further enforced by Greer talking just inserting himself into everything.
4570000	4572000	I forgot when he was talking about Michael.
4572000	4580000	He was saying that how he like worked out with Michael and how big Michael was and how much it made him soar to work out with Michael.
4580000	4586000	And it's, you know, it's, you know, why do you need to keep talking about yourself with all of that?
4586000	4592000	He likes to make himself the centerpiece of everything, but he has done great, great work.
4592000	4594000	Thanks for the shout out.
4594000	4596000	I'm just following your leads and focusing on the approval.
4596000	4598000	Yeah, exactly.
4598000	4608000	There's just there's a ton of fluff and euphology and I know myself I have gotten caught going down some rabbit holes that lead nowhere and done some dead end work or work that I later found out is kind of just not much to it.
4608000	4612000	But just kind of focus on what you can.
4612000	4622000	I like how this channel attracts both people capable and willing to actually think and share lunatics.
4622000	4624000	I don't, I don't know.
4624000	4626000	I think everybody here is pretty, pretty crafty, pretty smart.
4626000	4628000	I don't think I know of any lunatics in this chat.
4628000	4632000	Everybody is pretty brilliant, especially as we saw last week, man.
4632000	4636000	Everybody, everybody has something to say something to add.
4636000	4640000	I'd love every single person in here.
4640000	4642000	Implementing closed loop processes.
4642000	4644000	Oh, I think I'm stumbling upon a conversation in the chat here.
4644000	4648000	You guys keep going and I'll get the summary at the end.
4648000	4650000	Definitely has hundreds of USAP whistleblowers in there.
4650000	4652000	Correct.
4652000	4658000	A lot, trust me as I've spent an uncomfortable amount of time pouring through the UFO witnesses list.
4658000	4662000	And I plan to make multiple more videos on hold on.
4662000	4664000	Let me actually ask you a question.
4664000	4674000	There are a lot of sources that I want to cover in the redacted files that I have some interesting information on.
4674000	4680000	Even if I can't talk to these people, because there are some others who I've identified who I'm trying to talk to.
4680000	4684000	Even if I can't talk about them, do you guys still want me to cover them?
4684000	4688000	Or is that kind of like a not as interesting?
4688000	4694000	There's like a seven to 10 other people I would like to cover, but I've been hesitant to do so unless I have spoken to them.
4694000	4700000	But if you guys still want to see that, even just kind of my research on there, I would gladly do that as well.
4700000	4702000	Gladly.
4702000	4704000	I appreciate it, Myer, that you speak your mind.
4704000	4706000	That's the martial artist and you thank you very much.
4706000	4708000	I got to be careful speaking my mind.
4708000	4716000	I think just because I have a platform where I make videos, it's just important to kind of say when I don't know something.
4716000	4722000	I'll speak my mind, but then I'll say if it's got some nonsense in there, then I'll say it.
4722000	4724000	Have you heard about the big homie sea?
4724000	4727000	Yeah, let me let me grab a quick drink of water.
4727000	4733000	I'll do it away from the mic so I don't sound like a slurper in the mic.
4733000	4734000	I have.
4734000	4744000	I find it interesting, but I'm there's not much for me to investigate there, but it is interesting.
4744000	4745000	Doty's sauce.
4745000	4747000	I was surprised to make connections to lose book.
4747000	4749000	Doty is very stuff.
4749000	4750000	Sorry.
4750000	4753000	You should research the connection between DMT and NHI.
4753000	4756000	I forgot the name of the researcher who wrote that book, but he was working with John Mack.
4756000	4758000	That's not the work of no, that's not Terrence McKenna.
4758000	4760000	He worked with psilocybin.
4760000	4761000	Right.
4761000	4762000	I actually would like to pursue that more.
4762000	4770000	I think it's very interesting because there's there's the claims of like Alex Jones of DMT and NHI, but then there's a lot more grounded research.
4770000	4773000	So I would like to go down that rabbit hole.
4773000	4775000	You staff disinformation agent.
4775000	4777000	I think Doty was AFSOI, right?
4777000	4779000	Maybe I targeted Benowitz.
4779000	4780000	Yes.
4780000	4781000	Crazy committed suicide.
4781000	4782000	Yes.
4782000	4787000	These are all great points for anybody kind of looking into Doty.
4787000	4789000	Why all the hate on Greer?
4789000	4794000	I think people just have very hot and cold opinions on Greer.
4794000	4799000	I don't think that as that's much hate as it is people being rightfully critical of Greer.
4799000	4804000	Now, people are often very critical of Greer and I support that, but I also preach time and time again.
4804000	4813000	It's also important to give Greer credit where credit is due because Greer has done incredible work in the field of ufology would not be where it is today without Greer.
4813000	4815000	Absolutely not.
4815000	4817000	Hey, Towney 3057.
4817000	4819000	Thank you for the Australian 30 bucks.
4819000	4820000	I really appreciate that, man.
4820000	4822000	Thank you so much for tuning in.
4822000	4824000	Thank you very much.
4824000	4828000	Other than personal opinions, what's the deal about Greer?
4828000	4840000	This is just kind of what we discussed earlier that with a lot of witnesses, he will kind of make their story his own as kind of I saw firsthand and kind of make himself the center of everything in his event today.
4840000	4852000	He practices terrible operational security stating that he cares for the sanctity of whistleblowers and their anonymity, but he violates OPSEC horrifically in the worst way I have ever seen with TV.
4852000	4863000	I grappled with even publishing that his account for so long with TV because I knew that anybody could just hop on the DPI archive and find a name associated with it within seconds.
4863000	4871000	But Greer violates OPSEC and I just don't think he does enough work to vet all of the people who contact him.
4871000	4877000	I think anybody who kind of contacts him, if there's a story there, he just throws it into the witness list, right?
4877000	4885000	Because there's in the witness list, I think it's just stuff for quantity over quality because there's so many names in that that are just like point of contact to other witnesses.
4885000	4887000	And that stuff should just be used for internal use, right?
4887000	4893000	Like there's no need for the average researcher like me to get any value out of witness.
4893000	4899000	This isn't an actual number, but 11067 who is a point of contact to other points of contact.
4899000	4902000	There's nothing of value there.
4902000	4904000	Flying Lotus, thank you so much, dude.
4904000	4905000	I appreciate that.
4905000	4908000	I think coming up Flying Lotus and I are going to play some Black Ops as it comes out.
4908000	4914000	If anybody else wants to play some Black Ops with us, we'll do it in the Discord and that should be a ton of fun.
4914000	4915000	A ton of fun.
4915000	4921000	Faking CE5 stuff, I've seen nothing about the CE5, so I really don't kind of know anything about that.
4921000	4927000	But I do struggle with the images he posts that are supposedly CE5 stuff.
4927000	4930000	It's just kind of lights.
4930000	4937000	And as we saw with the saucer photo that was taken from a Chile case that as far as we know, Greer is not associated with that case.
4937000	4939000	And again, I just want to say this again.
4939000	4944000	I know I'm being very critical of Greer, but I could also spend an equal amount of time celebrating the great work he's done.
4944000	4950000	I'm just going to shout out again the interview he did with Jonathan Wagan, which is a wonderful piece.
4950000	4953000	And you can read the actual written description in the DPI archive.
4953000	4963000	In the 2001 disclosure briefing document, he also provides his estimate on the Black Operation situation in terms of how this program operates quasi-nationally,
4963000	4974000	basically performs off the books, has almost mastered extraterrestrial technology, commands ARVs and so forth.
4974000	4975000	Excellent piece.
4975000	4984000	I do need to state that Greer did in fact, maybe it's not necessarily a brief, but did speak to Admiral Thomas Wilson amongst others about UFOs in 97.
4984000	4986000	That is true.
4986000	4989000	That dude, you are that dude telekinesis beats.
4989000	4990000	Thank you very much.
4990000	4991000	Philip Corso is the smoking gun.
4991000	4993000	Philip Corso is excellent.
4993000	5003000	I have talked to an individual who the same they know some like inside stuff and corporations and they have recommended Corso, a lot of Corso's work.
5003000	5005000	So that's really interesting.
5005000	5008000	Greer has helped to further bring attention to UAP UFO, USO.
5008000	5011000	So in some aspects, he did some good for the topic, but it's a double edged sword.
5011000	5013000	So he's kept some that agreed.
5013000	5018000	I think that's a really good way to put a double edged sword with the bad with with the bad with Greer.
5018000	5025000	I'm going to start dosing in some of the good with Greer because even though a lot of today, today with the with the what's it called his event.
5025000	5036000	I know I've I harped on a lot of points saying like old Greer stuffed himself into here, but still all of this work is is out of decades, decades of labor, decades will be Milo.
5036000	5037000	I love you as well.
5037000	5040000	Thank you very much.
5040000	5043000	I guess we'll know moving forward who's full of crap and who isn't.
5043000	5044000	I very much hope so.
5044000	5047000	I absolutely hope so.
5047000	5049000	Any thoughts on Tim Ventura and friends?
5049000	5051000	Why do I know that name?
5051000	5054000	You guys are going to roast me for not knowing Tim Ventura off the top of my head.
5054000	5057000	Somebody remind me and I will remember.
5057000	5059000	I will absolutely remember.
5059000	5064000	Do I have plans to collaborate with any other UFO related YouTube channels night shift invented?
5064000	5067000	I'm asking as they've shown keen interest in talking to you.
5067000	5070000	No, that's not that's not so much my thing.
5070000	5074000	Collabs, Jesse Michaels and John Michael Gaudier.
5075000	5077000	Those are those are some collabs.
5077000	5080000	I'll be doing and I will be seeing Jesse Michaels this week.
5080000	5085000	And I can't wait for that because he just interviewed Lou and I can't wait to speak to him about that.
5085000	5087000	That's going to be great.
5087000	5089000	Grubbs equals goat.
5089000	5090000	Thank you.
5090000	5091000	You are goat.
5091000	5093000	You are the goat Django.
5093000	5099000	What do you think about Harold Malmgren and former personal dental advisor Malmgren is extremely interesting.
5099000	5100000	And so is his daughter.
5100000	5105000	And I would like to speak to his daughter as she has made some excellent claims as well.
5105000	5108000	Excellent, excellent claims.
5108000	5109000	What do you think about blood?
5109000	5113000	So we discussed this last time I've remained similar to sans pretty agnostic to blood.
5113000	5118000	So I don't want to put forward an opinion on anything unless I have a kind of well versed research.
5118000	5120000	So I'll sit down, read some books about blood.
5120000	5122000	So watch some interviews and so forth.
5122000	5128000	And then I will form an opinion because I don't I don't want to just talk out of my behind.
5128000	5132000	I want your view on your research as opposed to your view on others.
5132000	5134000	I hope that's clear.
5134000	5137000	A lot of people do great research here.
5137000	5146000	I think that I just like to model my research a little bit more on like the old school researcher like the Dolan or the string field.
5146000	5152000	I find power in the written word and I try to create something that would be a written word and translated into a video.
5152000	5154000	I like the chasing down leads.
5154000	5157000	I like I like a little this is the way to do.
5157000	5161000	I like a little less news of the day type stuff and a little more long research into a topic.
5161000	5163000	That's just kind of how I like to do things.
5163000	5165000	I know everybody has their preference.
5165000	5167000	I know everybody has a preference.
5167000	5170000	Okay, let's go.
5170000	5174000	Don't don't you think it's weird that Rogan is suddenly super skeptical about all this?
5174000	5176000	I mean, from having a UAP in Lazare to not believe it anymore.
5176000	5177000	Why didn't Lou talk about his book?
5177000	5181000	Lou didn't talk about his book because Lou didn't want to sell his book on the podcast, which I very respect.
5181000	5183000	You might have to just talk about the phenomenon.
5183000	5189000	It's interesting how whenever there's a UAP related guy on Joe Rogan, Mike Baker, the CIA, former CIA guy is right there to clean it up.
5189000	5192000	I think Baker has 14 appearances on Jerry.
5192000	5195000	It's also really interesting to see Joe's.
5195000	5198000	I think Joe just likes to believe kind of what's in the cool conspiracy, right?
5198000	5205000	Because when he was really into UFOs, this was like 20 early or mid 2010s when the subject wasn't as popular as it was.
5205000	5207000	There wasn't as much serious research.
5207000	5213000	And he just kind of liked that it was more of a conspiracy.
5213000	5216000	In a way, I think he's a little bit more of a calm Eddie Bravo.
5216000	5218000	And we love Eddie Bravo.
5218000	5224000	Joe Rogan's episodes with Eddie Bravo and Alex Jones are some of the best entertainment you will ever see ever.
5224000	5227000	Speaking, your mind is potentially going to cost you.
5227000	5229000	Are you scared even a little?
5229000	5236000	No, I mean, I've probably crossed some toes, but it's all good.
5236000	5239000	Rick Strassman, where have I heard that name before Lotus?
5239000	5242000	Where have I heard that name?
5242000	5245000	I've heard of Freedward Winterberg.
5245000	5251000	That name rings a bell, but I can't reference it off the top of my head.
5251000	5254000	I have come across the names Falcon and Condor.
5254000	5261000	I think this was actually a career witness in 1980s in reference to like a blue team as well.
5261000	5266000	I have to find those files, but yes, I have.
5266000	5270000	Greer presents himself in a polarizing way, but if he's right even 10% of the time, then he's a valuable addition.
5270000	5271000	Yes, absolutely.
5271000	5281000	That's why everything that Greer puts out, I think needs to be researched independently from everything else and studied.
5281000	5286000	People mainly criticize Greer because of CE5 and how he monetized it while appearing to provide no evidence that it works.
5286000	5287000	I think so.
5287000	5293000	I think that's a good point because a lot of the CE5 stuff is really pricey.
5293000	5301000	I think in my Discord, I did kind of like an event revenue of this event that he did today just to kind of get a ballpark picture.
5301000	5308000	I think the place in which he spoke in London housed like 800 people and we'll just say that it was at full capacity.
5308000	5313000	Between tickets in there are $75 and then webinar tickets and stuff.
5313000	5320000	I think it was like a gross of $45,000 and this wasn't counting the 1,500 to sit and have dinner with Greer.
5320000	5328000	I just think he pushes the monetary incentive pretty heavy because he especially asks for donations and stuff for DPI archives.
5328000	5330000	I think he just really pushes that.
5331000	5342000	I'm not too well versed in psychedelics so I don't know how much I can answer there.
5342000	5344000	Greer just in terms of the impact is made.
5344000	5347000	It's up there with Jacques Villiers and Jean Mack and those figures he is.
5347000	5351000	Greer is on the Mount Rushmore of UFO researchers and I will say that.
5351000	5354000	Has Greer said anything recently about Lou Elizondo?
5355000	5362000	I think Greer is critical of Lou Elizondo and I'm trying to remember that right now, but I do think that.
5362000	5364000	I do think Greer is a charlatan.
5364000	5366000	I can understand why you think so.
5366000	5370000	There is a disinformation campaign to ruin Greer's name, especially on Twitter.
5370000	5380000	I wouldn't be surprised, but I think Greer is one of those guys that they can just kind of let go and do his own thing because as you see in the comments, Greer is so polarizing.
5380000	5383000	Everybody is so polarized about Greer.
5383000	5388000	So many people think he might be a charlatan, so many people respect him, and so many people are in between.
5388000	5391000	So I think Greer does that himself, to be honest.
5391000	5392000	What are your thoughts on Rogan?
5392000	5394000	Isn't it sus, suddenly a skeptic anymore?
5394000	5396000	Yes, absolutely.
5396000	5404000	I find it weird to think about when he had guests like Travis Walton on and Bob.
5404000	5407000	I stay away from talking about Bob.
5407000	5410000	I've said this before because I want so badly to believe Bob.
5410000	5418000	I can't really look at his case with a critical analysis because if I see the discrepancies in education, I'll just try and explain it the way as best as I can.
5418000	5426000	But Joe is so, so easy on Bob, especially when Bob had migraines when he couldn't answer a question.
5426000	5436000	But Joe, when he spoke to Grosh in particular, I know because I've watched that interview like 50 times, was extremely harsh and not a very gracious host, in my opinion.
5436000	5438000	Greer has beef with Elizondo.
5438000	5441000	Yes.
5441000	5443000	Sorry for repeating the question.
5443000	5444000	It didn't come through before.
5444000	5446000	I wanted to ask what made you consider the phenomenon being real?
5446000	5449000	For me, it was the Nimitz incident since I am into jets.
5449000	5450000	That's a good one.
5450000	5463000	I think that, I don't know if there was one specific incident that made me just say, Holy cow, the phenomenon is real just because I've been studying this since I was just so young.
5463000	5476000	In my mind, just with all the encounters I read about, especially when I was young, I was really into air force sightings and dog, not dog fights with craft, but like military sightings because I was so into military jets and UFOs.
5476000	5483000	I've just always been like the back of my head until I reached an older age, just kind of had to assume there was validity to this and so forth.
5483000	5488000	So I don't think there, I would like to hear from you guys, what was your like shining moment that made you say, Holy cow, this is real.
5488000	5490000	I'd like to hear that from you guys.
5491000	5495000	Rogan, Mike Baker, every time you talk, yeah, that's really funny.
5497000	5500000	Lou said a prominent member of the disclosure movement is disinfo.
5500000	5502000	He was probably referring to Greer.
5502000	5505000	Yeah, that was on a Sean Ryan, right?
5505000	5509000	No, that was Timber Shet, I think it was on the Sean Ryan show.
5509000	5515000	He referred to, maybe I'm thinking of a different incident, but Timber Shet says something similar.
5515000	5521000	I feel like you should do a video on DMT research in NHI as some people see entities on doing DMT.
5521000	5522000	That'd be fun.
5522000	5530000	I'd like that, but I will have to do a lot of research because I know very, very, very little about, I know very little about psychedelics, very little.
5530000	5535000	I really think we should, yeah, I'm just not well versed.
5535000	5538000	People like to crap on Greer for the sake of saying something.
5538000	5540000	They don't bother doing the research and go very deep on it.
5540000	5544000	ARV, Psychotronics, EMWs, DEWS, MKUltra, et cetera.
5544000	5545000	I completely agree.
5545000	5550000	A lot of the way Greer phrases stuff is very outlandish and standoffish.
5550000	5555000	So even stuff like P3 and Consciousness Connection Greer has been talking about for a while.
5555000	5569000	And I fell into the pitfall you're talking about, about kind of brushing that stuff golf because I thought it was a little too far fetched for me to pay attention to until I really started kind of sitting back and thinking about things.
5570000	5572000	Have you ever done any videos on June Crane?
5572000	5574000	I have not, but that would be interesting.
5574000	5577000	Did you read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman?
5577000	5582000	I didn't read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman, but I have read about the Corona crash and talked about it with Ryan Wood.
5582000	5593000	And I think Wood as well as, I think James Rigney, the guy who leaked the Wilson Davis documents, thinks that some details of Roswell are kind of mixed in with other crashes around the same time.
5593000	5596000	And one of those is Corona and so forth.
5596000	5598000	What's your take on Rogan recently?
5598000	5600000	I think you got warned by Feds to stop talking too much.
5600000	5601000	I want to be surprised.
5601000	5609000	I used to be a big Joe Rogan listener, but I feel like the quality of guests have died off and the talking points aren't nearly as interesting to me.
5609000	5612000	What have you heard of Harry Drew and do you think he is honest?
5612000	5613000	That is very interesting.
5613000	5618000	I have, I spoke about Harry Drew and the Kingman Crash very recently.
5618000	5624000	A certain, I'm not going to say their name just because I don't know if they want to kind of talk about that they're working on this.
5624000	5633000	But an interesting channel and myself were trying to track down Harry Drew's documentary about what he had a documentary about Kingman.
5633000	5635000	And we've been trying to track that down right now.
5635000	5639000	It's only been really a DVD that was sold with his book on Kingman.
5639000	5641000	I can't remember what it's called right now.
5641000	5643000	Like the fifth day in May or something like that.
5643000	5645000	I'm trying to remember what it's called.
5645000	5649000	But yeah, Harry Drew is the person that proposed that there were three Kingman crashes.
5649000	5651000	The first was a controlled descent.
5651000	5658000	The second or first was a controlled descent and the second two were crashes, two of which contained bodies as well.
5658000	5661000	And this occurred over in late May, 1953.
5661000	5662000	Harry Drew is really interesting.
5662000	5664000	I need to track down that dang documentary.
5664000	5668000	Ross Campbell says Kingman is extremely important.
5668000	5669000	I agree.
5669000	5673000	I think it's crucial to track down that dang documentary and continue to study.
5673000	5676000	I like to think back to the Chris Mellon signal exchange.
5676000	5685000	He released with a USG individual who talked about an SES gatekeeper in the Air Force and Kingman.
5685000	5687000	Joe got warned big time.
5687000	5688000	I think it's very possible.
5688000	5689000	I'm sorry.
5689000	5690000	I'm trying to keep up with everything.
5690000	5693000	If we talk about something, then like five minutes later, I get to the comment.
5693000	5695000	I'm sorry about that, guys.
5695000	5697000	Mike Baker talks for hours and says nothing.
5697000	5698000	He does.
5698000	5702000	I remember back in like 2017, I saw a Mike Baker episode and I said, Holy cow.
5702000	5703000	What's it going to be?
5703000	5708000	And this guy just jabbers, jabbers, jabbers, jabbers on with, with not much interesting
5708000	5709000	to say.
5709000	5711000	I dig Greer's view on drones versus UAP.
5711000	5712000	I have a feeling he's on to something.
5712000	5715000	The KMO drones jellyfish is a big retriever for DoD.
5715000	5716000	Yeah.
5716000	5717000	I found more and more.
5717000	5723000	I've warmed up to the idea that there's a more of a mix of ARV versus UAP according to Greer.
5723000	5725000	Bradley, what's up?
5725000	5729000	You have missed quite a lot and I would recommend starting from the beginning because we talked
5729000	5731000	about Greer's entire presentation today.
5731000	5732000	Rick Strasman.
5732000	5733000	I know Rick.
5733000	5734000	Okay.
5734000	5735000	Yes.
5735000	5736000	Okay.
5736000	5737000	I will read that.
5737000	5738000	I will read that.
5738000	5739000	That sounds really interesting.
5739000	5741000	I think Rogan might still believe.
5741000	5742000	Yeah.
5742000	5743000	Yeah.
5743000	5751000	Probably with that with how big Rogan is, he probably is just bombarded with so much as
5751000	5752000	well.
5752000	5753000	So much.
5753000	5757500	Maybe people who are just claiming to have sightings and so forth that he just is a little
5757500	5761500	bit jaded to the topic, which is crazy to me if he is jaded to the topic because he'll
5761500	5766500	have guys like Lou and Grush on and kind of treat them not as pleasantly as I would have
5766500	5767500	thought.
5767500	5770500	Are you familiar with the alleged crash of a man made triangular ARV in East Germany?
5770500	5771500	Was that in?
5771500	5775500	Let me get out a copy of Magic Eyes Only.
5775500	5779500	What year was that in?
5779500	5780500	Sorry.
5780500	5782500	I dropped my water bottle.
5782500	5785500	I need to find out what year that was in.
5785500	5794500	I want to say 80s, maybe earlier, but I do remember that case.
5794500	5795500	Okay.
5795500	5798500	Kai, I will look for you because I have heard of that case.
5798500	5800500	You're saying it was Mark McCandlish.
5800500	5801500	He talked about it.
5801500	5802500	Was that when he talked?
5802500	5803500	Okay.
5803500	5804500	Let me see.
5804500	5805500	I know I've heard about that.
5805500	5806500	I'm just having trouble referencing.
5806500	5808500	I appreciate the piece on Michael.
5808500	5809500	He will be anointed hero.
5809500	5810500	I hope so.
5810500	5814500	I would very much like for Michael to be able to speak a little more.
5814500	5815500	Very much like that.
5815500	5818500	I appreciate Lou for being humble that he doesn't mention his book out late,
5818500	5821500	despite essentially living in an ARV with his wife facing economic hardship.
5821500	5824500	Since speaking out about UAP, UFO, USO, et cetera.
5824500	5825500	Yeah.
5825500	5827500	Whatever your view is on Lou, it is respectful that especially on JR,
5827500	5829500	he doesn't mention his book once.
5829500	5830500	Once.
5830500	5831500	Falcon and Condor.
5831500	5832500	Yeah.
5832500	5833500	Aviary codenames.
5833500	5835500	Rick Dodie is one of them.
5835500	5838500	I think John B. Alexander is another.
5838500	5841500	Oh, and this was a witness.
5842500	5845500	A H A H in the Greer archive.
5845500	5848500	I can't remember exactly what name it is.
5848500	5850500	Slimy Toad made me fart real bad.
5850500	5853500	Well, maybe you shouldn't take Slimy Toad, brother.
5853500	5857500	Seriousness aside, Greer looks like a reptilian wearing a human meat suit.
5857500	5859500	I hope he's not a secret reptilian.
5859500	5863500	Is there a chance the government actually works together on this behind the curtains?
5863500	5864500	Why?
5864500	5865500	Yes.
5865500	5866500	Five eyes to a degree.
5866500	5867500	Five eyes nations.
5867500	5872500	US, UK, New Zealand, Australia and Canada work together on this.
5872500	5877500	You can look at a 2023 memo from Canadian politician Larry McGuire to the Canadian
5877500	5881500	Minister of Defense that speaks about being more transparent about five eyes
5881500	5883500	working together with UAP.
5883500	5888500	If you listen to the UK whistle or sorry, the infographics whistleblower I covered
5888500	5891500	and you take that testimony as a real testimony or just somebody giving a real
5891500	5895500	testimony, you remember that Europe and many countries in Europe have been a default
5895500	5900500	agreement with the US that the US gets ownership of those technologies.
5900500	5902500	Really respect your view on Greer.
5902500	5905500	Obviously you have issues with him, but you don't turn a blind eye to his data.
5905500	5906500	Absolutely not.
5906500	5911500	The DPI archive has been a true gift, a true gift.
5911500	5914500	I have tried Greer CE5 protocols myself at home.
5914500	5915500	It worked.
5915500	5918500	Objects legit started appearing, disappearing, flashing, interacting with my thoughts.
5918500	5921500	I would like to hear more at what elevation did they appear?
5921500	5922500	Were they just light sources?
5922500	5924500	Could you make out like a tangible craft design?
5924500	5925500	Tell us more.
5925500	5926500	I think that's very interesting.
5926500	5930500	Very interesting.
5930500	5935500	Tim Ventura works at all propulsion, APEC works with Mark Sockle, Charles Bueller, Drew
5935500	5936500	Arajima.
5936500	5942500	Yes, I have heard of this, heard of him, but I've never really dove into any of his
5942500	5943500	work.
5943500	5944500	Sorry.
5944500	5949500	How many whistleblowers do you think will appear at the next UAP hearing?
5949500	5954500	Probably right now, I don't have very high hopes for many.
5954500	5958500	I think the 2023 congressional hearings, there were supposed to be two additional
5958500	5961500	whistleblowers that didn't show up.
5961500	5967500	I would hope more, but with whistleblower protection right now in terms of not safeguarding
5967500	5972500	people's pensions, I don't know how many people want to do that.
5972500	5975500	There are too many people who focus on the people more than the content.
5975500	5976500	Yes.
5976500	5977500	I 100% agree.
5977500	5978500	Well put.
5978500	5983500	Falcon was, yes, I believe it was, I believe Falcon was Richard Dodie.
5983500	5986500	Wow, we're just getting to the Grush and JR Retalk.
5986500	5989500	Yeah, he was standoffish with Grush.
5989500	5995500	Joe was kind of just like really laissez-faire with that, kind of relaxed and taken very
5995500	5996500	seriously.
5996500	5999500	Rogan Krabs on Grush and Lou behind their backs, but he blindly defends Lazare.
5999500	6003500	Yeah, it seems like he has a big problem with Grush and then the TTSA crowd.
6004500	6006500	The releasing is not right wing.
6006500	6011500	You asked politics is a mess, a mess.
6011500	6014500	Your video on the private sector should be required viewing for anyone in the community
6014500	6016500	and any conspiracy communities.
6016500	6018500	This is so big.
6018500	6019500	I appreciate that.
6019500	6020500	Thank you.
6020500	6025500	Are you talking Battelle, Lockheed or SAIC?
6025500	6029500	Timbershed recently said that next hearings will likely primarily consist of scientists
6029500	6030500	and more pilots.
6030500	6031500	Yeah.
6031500	6036500	As much as I enjoy hearing about Ryan Graves, we need firsthand testimony of the people
6036500	6041500	that Greer says he's talking to about people who have actually retrieved craft, like he
6041500	6044500	said, who flew him over the Hellendale plant.
6044500	6045500	Rogan is being led by gatekeepers.
6045500	6047500	I wouldn't be surprised.
6047500	6051500	We should deep dive CEO of these companies with special access programs.
6051500	6053500	I bet something surfaces.
6053500	6054500	Someone was, but oh, that reminds me.
6054500	6059500	Greer said his uncle was the Grumman in Northrop Grumman, but that he had no knowledge of
6059500	6060500	UAP situations.
6060500	6064500	I would like to look into CEOs, as well as some head-up scientists.
6064500	6069500	We talked about this last week, but Lockheed Martin and Jim Ryder, as mentioned in Lou
6069500	6070500	Elizondo's book, Eminent.
6070500	6073500	I think there's a lot of interesting people we could study.
6073500	6078500	As well as looking at board of directors of companies and their previous relationships
6078500	6082500	in terms of work on the CIA, because you have Ronald Moultrie, who's on the board of directors
6082500	6084500	for the Carlisle Group.
6084500	6088500	He was a big with Sean Kirkpatrick and so forth.
6088500	6089500	There's a lot of great connections.
6089500	6090500	For me, it was Mark McCandless.
6090500	6091500	I see what you're saying.
6091500	6093500	Mark McCandless broke that ground for you.
6093500	6095500	Mark McCandless's story is excellent.
6095500	6102500	I really want to cover it in full detail and give it the true justice it deserves.
6102500	6104500	David Fraber got me started after that.
6104500	6106500	The testimonies are just impossible to know, both in quality and quantity.
6106500	6109500	Everything else seems like rumors to me, but I still find them interesting.
6109500	6113500	I remember when the Tic Tac case, when Fraber really started talking about his experience
6113500	6119500	on Joe Rogan and so forth, that felt monumental.
6119500	6123500	Real when David Grush came forward and I started researching and here I am.
6123500	6129500	If you were led here by Grush, I couldn't think of anything better.
6129500	6131500	Shining Moment was actually Bob Lazar interview with Rogan.
6131500	6135500	I believe everywhere he says from there, I started exploring rabbit holes.
6135500	6136500	Interesting.
6136500	6138500	Bob Lazar is, of course, so contentious.
6138500	6144500	I love, I could talk about Bob all dang day, all day.
6144500	6145500	Okay.
6145500	6149500	Flying Lotus, if you're still here, is Brainfeeder taking fall interns?
6149500	6153500	I can also text him about that.
6153500	6155500	I know, I will text him about that.
6155500	6159500	I didn't even know this stuff was going on until I saw the Nimitz incident,
6159500	6162500	which Nimitz incident would lead me to the hearing, which made me realize that
6162500	6164500	an experience I had was 100% of UAP.
6164500	6165500	Tell me about it.
6165500	6166500	That's really interesting.
6166500	6169500	You can either tell me about it here in the Discord because I would really like to hear
6169500	6170500	that.
6170500	6172500	McKinnon, let's just filmmaker was poisoned.
6172500	6173500	I forgot.
6173500	6174500	Yeah.
6174500	6176500	Greer said in this, sorry, I'll probably have details about the event come to me.
6176500	6179500	Greer stated that four people he has worked with have been killed.
6179500	6182500	I have not seen evidence for that, but he did state that.
6182500	6184500	He did state that.
6184500	6186500	I was attacked by a Translucent Bean when I was 19 or 20.
6186500	6188500	I was in between sleep and awake and it wasn't a dream.
6188500	6191500	It was like a tentacle pearl Translucent Bean.
6191500	6193500	That sounds horrifying.
6193500	6194500	Horrifying.
6194500	6196500	That sounds very scary.
6196500	6203500	Like in a hypnagogic state almost.
6203500	6206500	Respect your comment on old school research first news of the day.
6206500	6208500	I'm just an old school guy.
6208500	6212500	That's why I like wrestling with people and studying UFOs.
6212500	6214500	Greer is way ahead of Congress.
6214500	6216500	Even he is another level.
6216500	6219500	Greer is way, way ahead of Congress.
6219500	6221500	Even he is another level research.
6221500	6222500	Him.
6222500	6223500	He's.
6223500	6225500	I agree with you, Alan.
6225500	6227500	I don't know what you're saying, but I agree.
6227500	6229500	I met Greer's first time doing DMT.
6229500	6232500	It was expecting machine elves and fractals.
6232500	6234500	It was more real than real.
6234500	6237500	I don't know anything about UFO and Greer lore prior.
6237500	6240500	Now, after getting involved in UFO lore,
6240500	6245500	would you say these Greys that you saw are kind of like the classic depiction of Greys?
6245500	6247500	Me and the homies are all a girl build.
6247500	6249500	I hope everybody is, man.
6249500	6251500	How do I get in contact with these whistleblowers?
6251500	6255500	I would definitely like to do a video of myself on some of these people.
6255500	6257500	Is it because of your following?
6257500	6259500	Not likely.
6259500	6263500	For how I got in contact with Michael, for example, you guys know this.
6263500	6265500	I first got in contact with Joey.
6265500	6268500	Any of the people I've covered, like MSTB,
6268500	6274500	I have gone really far out of my way to contact these people.
6274500	6281500	Discerning the names on the DPI archive has taken anywhere from five minutes with TB to a week
6281500	6283500	to try to find these names.
6283500	6285500	Then, of course, it involves contacting these people,
6285500	6287500	seeing if they'll be willing to talk.
6287500	6293500	I can't tell you how. I have a dozen people who have told me no, not interested.
6293500	6296500	I mean, the name is listed in the archive.
6296500	6299500	I'm going to double check the archive because I don't want to burn the name if it's not there.
6299500	6304500	But there was a doctor that Greer stated had a UAP encounter on a ship,
6304500	6310500	on a Navy ship who a UAP came out of the water,
6310500	6316500	landed nearby and basically destroyed some of the local surroundings just with its landing.
6316500	6321500	In the archives with Greer, this individual also apparently had a point of contact
6321500	6326500	to a former Navy SEAL who was in charge of tracking UAPs coming out of a certain location.
6326500	6328500	I don't know what this location is underwater.
6328500	6330500	I contacted this person.
6330500	6336500	I said, and I will say who the person is next live if I find their name is still in the DPI archive
6336500	6338500	because it's listed out right.
6338500	6341500	But I contacted this person. They're an elderly doctor.
6341500	6343500	And I said, hey, would you be interested in talking about this?
6343500	6345500	I found your name in the DPI archive.
6345500	6346500	They didn't say no, it's not true.
6346500	6348500	They just said, I'm not interested.
6348500	6351500	And kind of a little back and forth with them telling me to kind of get lost.
6351500	6354500	So that was pretty dang interesting to me.
6354500	6356500	Seven days in May, that's it.
6356500	6359500	I was almost, I was almost on it.
6359500	6362500	Almost on it.
6362500	6367500	When I said I wanted your views, it was in reference to whistleblowers you haven't spoken to directly.
6367500	6370500	Oh, okay.
6370500	6373500	Whistleblowers I haven't spoken to directly.
6373500	6374500	Well, I would like to speak to them.
6374500	6377500	I just really enjoy talking to a lot of these people.
6377500	6383500	But there are a lot of prospective whistleblowers I will be trying to contact soon.
6383500	6385500	Large light formation hanging low in the sky.
6385500	6387500	Unbelievable color and formation free.
6387500	6389500	Mental Western Australia in 2005.
6389500	6391500	Tell me more about it.
6391500	6392500	What did this formation do?
6392500	6394500	What color was it and so forth?
6394500	6401500	Have you heard anything about the UAP so big it was presumably buried under something?
6401500	6406500	Of course, TB has spoken about one buried in Seoul, South Korea and his notes.
6406500	6411500	I think there are some people that think that the UAP Ross Colt Hart is referring to that was so big,
6411500	6415500	which I'm certain that you're referring to is in Pine Gap Australia.
6415500	6422500	I have not received any sort of interesting intelligence or kind of investigation on that subject.
6422500	6424500	I know very little about it.
6424500	6429500	I know very little about it, but I just don't even know where to begin researching where that site may be.
6429500	6430500	June Crane is worth a video.
6430500	6431500	Okay.
6431500	6432500	Her statements corroborate.
6432500	6433500	Roswell and her credentials are proven.
6433500	6434500	She had Q clearance.
6434500	6437500	Researcher interviewed is still alive today and is extremely kind.
6437500	6438500	Former LEO.
6438500	6439500	Okay.
6439500	6440500	I will.
6440500	6442500	I would absolutely do that and try and contact that guy.
6442500	6450500	You know, we, we need the Greer and Herrera insider to come forward publicly and end this debate once and for all to expose PLF,
6450500	6453500	Psychotronics used in fake abduction, ARVs, EMW attacks.
6453500	6455500	I completely agree.
6455500	6461500	I think this individual coming forward will, will, would be monumental,
6461500	6463500	especially if this person came forward with evidence.
6463500	6465500	I would like to see that.
6465500	6467500	Literally trying to get bro to the loose and they listen.
6467500	6474500	I don't, I don't do, I don't do, uh, I don't do any substances, but I don't have problems of people do if they're an adult.
6474500	6477500	And that's what they, that's what they choose to do.
6477500	6479500	It's, it's their body, their choice.
6479500	6486500	Uh, man's doesn't look like he needs any more trouble keeping it together.
6486500	6488500	Keep kicking butt.
6488500	6489500	Best show on the topic.
6489500	6490500	I appreciate that man.
6490500	6491500	Much love.
6491500	6492500	Thank you very much.
6492500	6493500	That means the most.
6494500	6496500	Uh, sorry.
6497500	6499500	Greer was telling the truth about Admiral Wilson's briefing documents.
6499500	6500500	He's telling the truth for decades.
6500500	6501500	No one believed him.
6501500	6502500	Doesn't that tell you something?
6502500	6503500	Absolutely.
6503500	6504500	Absolutely.
6504500	6505500	It does Greer.
6505500	6515500	I mean, I think Admiral Wilson even admitted to speaking to Greer, but even when he still denied the, the, sorry, my brain's being scared.
6515500	6519500	Even when he denied the allegations of the Wilson Davis memo being true, but Greer did do that.
6519500	6520500	Yes.
6520500	6522500	That's why I think that is why I took the approach.
6522500	6526500	I did it with Greer's witnesses that they really need to be investigated.
6526500	6527500	The filter.
6527500	6529500	Who has big eyes?
6529500	6532500	Let me know who, let me know who has, who has the big eyes.
6532500	6534500	Like, I'd like to hear about that.
6534500	6535500	Love what you do.
6535500	6536500	Keep the deep eyes.
6536500	6537500	Thank you for training your excellent work.
6537500	6540500	Had some weird results with CE5 over the years, but recommended even if it's just to go stargazing.
6540500	6542500	I would like to hear about this.
6542500	6543500	Absolutely.
6543500	6544500	Please.
6546500	6547500	Mark.
6547500	6548500	Yes.
6548500	6549500	This is important to know about Mark.
6549500	6551500	Mark was an aerospace contractor illustrator.
6551500	6553500	He did a ton of work, a ton of great work.
6553500	6558500	And he also has a lot of interesting points of contact and so forth.
6558500	6562500	Let me get some cold brew.
6562500	6563500	Sorry guys.
6563500	6567500	Remember when Dodie said ETs like straw?
6567500	6568500	Did he?
6568500	6574500	I don't remember him saying that, but I, I don't, I don't, I don't doubt that.
6574500	6576500	Have you had a UAP setting up some kind?
6576500	6577500	Yeah.
6577500	6578500	I talked about this last time.
6578500	6581500	I don't ever really talk about it just because it's, it's not too big of a deal.
6581500	6587500	You know, I think like many people have had experiences just where I've seen these strange
6587500	6592500	lights in the sky, strange formations doing zigzagging in the sky and so forth, but no
6592500	6596500	tangible actual craft or an actual structure I could make out.
6596500	6601500	And I would talk about it more if I had, if I myself had seen the exact body of a saucer
6601500	6602500	or a triangle.
6602500	6605500	The five eyes things makes a lot of sense when you start looking at the way the internet
6605500	6609500	globally, NC and AU are high or handy just based on geography.
6609500	6610500	Absolutely.
6610500	6611500	Absolutely.
6611500	6615500	I also think there's a lot of interesting Australia stuff to, to study.
6615500	6618500	Rogan is skeptical of anything coming from the government to be honest.
6618500	6621500	Chuck Schumer, Hilly Clinton being involved in disclosure is kind of weird.
6621500	6623500	There's evidence Hillary has known something.
6623500	6624500	Yeah.
6624500	6625500	With John Podesta.
6625500	6626500	Absolutely.
6626500	6627500	That is weird.
6627500	6630500	And maybe that ties into what we talked about at the beginning of this live stream where
6630500	6635500	we were talked about first being approached to buy white hats or blue team under the Clinton
6635500	6636500	administration.
6636500	6637500	Who knows?
6637500	6638500	Okay.
6638500	6645500	I was told UAP is hide in our underground aquifer surfacing through connected lakes and streams.
6645500	6646500	They are well hidden.
6646500	6648500	That is, that is very interesting.
6648500	6653500	That is very interesting, especially with stories of UAP kind of appearing from lakes and so
6653500	6654500	forth.
6654500	6655500	That's actually really interesting.
6655500	6656500	I've never heard that.
6656500	6659500	Your spine on your, yeah, that's a good point.
6659500	6662500	Five eyes, five eyes joint intelligence.
6662500	6665500	What are your thoughts on the UFO that is way too big to move?
6665500	6667500	Elizondo was asked about it in a recent interview.
6667500	6668500	We just talked about this.
6668500	6671500	That is from the, I think originally proposed by Ross Colt Hart.
6671500	6674500	I've heard some people say South, South Korea.
6674500	6676500	Some people say Pine Gap Australia.
6676500	6681500	I don't know what that, I don't know what the heck to think.
6681500	6682500	Really Greer is worth researching.
6682500	6685500	The guy is a lot more in the know than anyone else in the field.
6685500	6688500	Chris is life dedicated to this and what's the trauma surgeon?
6688500	6689500	Absolutely.
6689500	6695500	That is why I have dedicated probably two hours of every single day to studying Greer's materials.
6695500	6698500	Absolutely.
6698500	6701500	Greed with all this witness folks on favorite graves.
6701500	6703500	There are so many, many better cases and witnesses out there.
6703500	6704500	I agree.
6704500	6707500	One of those I'd like to see is Mr. TB.
6707500	6710500	Great point mentioning Hellendale radar cross-section facilities.
6710500	6712500	Definitely a place worth keeping an eye on.
6712500	6716500	It was as was the Lockheed Lighthouse in Virginia.
6716500	6718500	Yeah, that's an interesting location to mention.
6718500	6722500	Again, if you weren't here when we talked about the Hellendale site earlier,
6722500	6725500	Greer in his symposium today talked about Hellendale,
6725500	6728500	posted pictures of it, said he was flown over this site,
6728500	6730500	but didn't mention Hellendale.
6730500	6737500	Also checked the DPI archive and found it very strange that all sort of images of Hellendale
6737500	6741500	in reference to Hellendale were kind of taken off the photo site.
6741500	6744500	Greer in graves are such experienced pilots as were the radar operators.
6744500	6745500	Yes.
6745500	6748500	No, I think the balloon.
6748500	6752500	Yeah, those cases are not, especially multi-sensor detection like that.
6752500	6753500	No.
6753500	6756500	What are your thoughts about the Soviet Union UFO cases where UFO above a nuclear silo
6756500	6758500	is activated multiple nuclear ICBMs?
6758500	6761500	Yeah, that's so interesting because of course, in a lot of our cases here,
6761500	6765500	but not AFB, any cases of malabstrom around nuclear arms.
6765500	6770500	It always seems like that the Minutemen missiles or the ICBMs are basically effectively rendered useless
6770500	6773500	and there are Russian cases about them almost being activated.
6773500	6776500	I don't know what to think about that, to be honest.
6776500	6779500	Really don't.
6779500	6787500	I can't remember, I can't prove it, but I remember reading Trump was only briefed on UAP.
6787500	6793500	You're remembering that from Lou and Ross Colthart have both said that.
6793500	6796500	Why would our UAP moderators claim Greer is a charlatan?
6796500	6799500	I had a post removed a while back after sharing a link to one of his documents.
6799500	6801500	I think that's kind of bogus.
6801500	6808500	Sharing Greer documents is kind of wild to just say that's a disinformation or not true.
6808500	6809500	That would be huge.
6809500	6810500	Appreciate it.
6810500	6811500	Been talking with the stones.
6811500	6815500	You've been talking with stones for recently, but brain feed or internship would be a dream.
6815500	6816500	How can I send you my contact info?
6816500	6817500	Either join the Discord.
6817500	6820500	I'll post the link in the here.
6820500	6821500	Sorry.
6821500	6824500	I need to remember how to invite people.
6824500	6826500	I'll post the Discord link in here.
6826500	6828500	Otherwise, UAPGIRB at gmail.com.
6828500	6831500	Here's the Discord link if anybody would like to join.
6831500	6835500	There's been some good discussion today and you can see all my notes as they were from
6835500	6837500	today's presentation.
6837500	6839500	Heaps of short boys.
6849500	6851500	Guys, can you hear me?
6851500	6853500	I think I accidentally just left the live.
6853500	6858500	If anybody can hear me, let me know.
6858500	6862500	Let me know if you can hear me.
6862500	6863500	Okay.
6863500	6865500	I think I'm still live.
6865500	6867500	Somebody let me know, please.
6867500	6868500	Okay.
6868500	6869500	Great.
6869500	6870500	I'm sorry.
6870500	6872500	I accidentally just hit a, I have one of those gaming, gaming mouses.
6872500	6874500	So I actually just backed out.
6874500	6876500	I'm going to try to find out exactly where I was.
6876500	6878500	I'm very sorry for that, guys.
6878500	6879500	Okay.
6879500	6880500	Here we go.
6880500	6881500	Sorry about that, guys.
6881500	6882500	My bad.
6882500	6884500	I went into UAP with three others about 15 years ago.
6884500	6886500	It looked to be a green shooting star.
6886500	6888500	It fell long enough to call attention to it.
6888500	6890500	Then accelerated to a 45 degree England disappeared.
6890500	6894500	That's very interesting, especially with the case I'm covering right now being labeled a
6894500	6896500	meteor until it turned 25 degrees.
6896500	6900500	So that is a, that's really interesting to hear the flying lotus.
6900500	6903500	Yes, flying, flying lotus is a fan of the Gerb channel.
6903500	6905500	And I'm a fan of his music.
6905500	6907500	Excellent music.
6907500	6910500	I'm surprised there hasn't been anyone who takes psychedelics before doing CE5.
6910500	6916500	Because we know the, the P3 people are given a cocktail of drugs before they're what we
6916500	6919500	would call their version of CE5 experience.
6919500	6921500	I wanted to know what I've seen ever since.
6921500	6922500	No idea what it could do.
6922500	6924500	These things I saw it do.
6924500	6931500	I, when you see impossible feats in the sky, there's a very, very strange.
6931500	6934500	Let's go to, is it triangle formation?
6934500	6935500	Okay.
6935500	6938500	You were talking about your UFO sighting triangle formation, triangle light formation above
6938500	6942500	your garden, coming to a sudden stop, changing colors, pulsating, suddenly skipping, flying
6942500	6944500	off into an instant at the speed of a modern day jet.
6944500	6950500	I wonder if that is like a TR3B or some ARV.
6950500	6954500	People love dismissing plant-based contact experience.
6954500	6955500	I think so.
6955500	6960500	Again, I don't have a lot of, I'm pretty uninformed on any sort of psychedelic.
6960500	6966500	So I, my opinion is probably one of the most ill-informed, ill-informed out there.
6966500	6969500	It still amazed me that Schumer Rounds Memo doesn't get more attention because the fact
6969500	6973500	they both pushed for it, yes, especially with 27 mentions of non-human intelligence, the
6973500	6979500	mention of legacy programs, the mention of UAP materials being misclassified under the
6979500	6985500	1954 atomic energy agreement under transclassified foreign nuclear materials.
6985500	6989500	Let's go.
6989500	6992500	Why should people take abduction cases from their beds seriously?
6992500	6993500	Why take any of this seriously?
6993500	6998500	I think in terms of abduction cases, especially from the bed, the research of John Mack was
6998500	7003500	used just to try and find similarities between, between kind of cases.
7003500	7005500	Anthony, thank you so much for the five bucks.
7005500	7007500	Have I ever looked into the Eiger 1992 video?
7007500	7011500	The detail in the life form makes it hard to debunk.
7011500	7019500	Let me, I feel like I've heard of that.
7019500	7022500	Let me get back to you on that because I feel like I've heard of that video.
7022500	7026500	I can't recall it off the top of my head.
7026500	7029500	I love your logical no clickbait approach.
7029500	7031500	Your channel is massively under subscribed.
7031500	7032500	I appreciate that.
7032500	7036500	I hate clickbait because I grew up before clickbait was a real thing.
7036500	7041500	So back in the day when there'd be videos saying like, oh, don't watch, don't, don't play
7041500	7043500	Minecraft at 3am, warning scary.
7043500	7046500	I, that just puts such a sour taste in my mouth.
7046500	7047500	Kai, thank you.
7047500	7050500	I see it and I can't wait to talk to you about that after watching it.
7050500	7052500	It's sad what happened to Mark.
7052500	7053500	Absolutely.
7053500	7055500	Hey, what's up, Aussie, my Aussie brethren.
7055500	7057500	Nice to see you, man.
7057500	7060500	Why are there so many Democrats involved in disclosure?
7060500	7063500	Interesting question, especially kind of Clinton, Podesta and so forth.
7063500	7068500	Now it's a, hopefully we can continue this issue being a little bit more middle of the aisle.
7068500	7071500	Some of the best UAP contract content out there.
7071500	7073500	I appreciate that man.
7073500	7074500	Seriously, much love.
7074500	7076500	That, that means the most.
7076500	7079500	Um, let's see.
7079500	7084500	Let's get to a video debunking Mick West claims.
7084500	7085500	That would be fun.
7085500	7089500	I see, I leave that to guys like Merrick Von Damic.
7089500	7091500	I can never say his last name.
7091500	7096500	I leave, leave that to men like that who are a little bit more well versed in their claims
7096500	7100500	of counter analyses because I don't have the same analysis skills on sightings and so forth
7100500	7104500	as Merrick does to kind of counter Mick West's claims and so forth.
7104500	7108500	Of course I could when he says stuff just really out of pocket stuff when it comes to
7108500	7112500	kind of, uh, whistleblowers and so forth.
7112500	7115500	That would be, uh, let's see.
7115500	7118500	Hillary wanted disclosure, but Obama got out of the way to comment on UFOs and was making a Betty.
7118500	7124500	That is weird that, uh, that Obama is now producing a Betty and Barney Hill documentary.
7124500	7126500	I haven't heard any update on that.
7126500	7130500	If you, I first met Greer in the nineties in Pensacola, Florida at Sacred Heart Hospital.
7130500	7134500	He, he was a trauma surgeon at, uh, at Sacred Heart, right?
7134500	7136500	I think that's where he was.
7136500	7139500	Now the Illuminati in contact with the bad end at H.I.
7139500	7141500	And the ones being shot down are the good guys.
7141500	7142500	I don't know.
7142500	7148500	Of course I've heard of interfactionality of NHIs and ETs, but I'm not sure to which, to what extent that goes.
7148500	7151500	And of course you listened to David Grush talk about agreements with NHI.
7151500	7155500	I'm not sure, uh, what agreements have been made with whom.
7155500	7158500	Police chiefs across the U.S. have issued the first official.
7158500	7159500	That's very interesting.
7159500	7165500	Ross Colard posted that last week providing law enforcement, uh, enforcement officers with instructions on how to report and respond.
7165500	7166500	Yes, that's great.
7166500	7171500	I'll link that in the discord because that's a, that's a really good document.
7171500	7178500	But from what I hear right when presidents are disproportionately briefed as there's a strong presence of fascist and or religious fundamentalists such as Collins Leighton, the program.
7178500	7179500	I've heard that too.
7179500	7185500	Especially of interest being briefed who I think is a little overlooked is Lyndon B. Johnson.
7185500	7187500	I'll give you guys a little tasty treat right here.
7187500	7198500	Um, Lyndon B. Johnson, you guys remember my video on Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who talked about Dr. Eric Walker being involved in UFO crash retrieval since the early 1950s with Vannevar Bush.
7198500	7209500	Robert Sarbacher also self admitted that he was part of UAP, uh, collection efforts as well as knew what the majestic 12 was as well as said he was himself present at the Kecksburg UFO crash in 1965.
7209500	7217500	Well, Dr. Eric Walker and Lyndon B. Johnson had a very close correspondence where they would say send each other very personal letters.
7217500	7220500	So that's really interesting to see a link between those two.
7220500	7226500	Uh, what do I think of the eye?
7226500	7228500	I saw the image, but I never investigated further.
7228500	7235500	Uh, maybe I will sometime, but there was just so much, uh, so much, there's just always so much going on so many cases to look at.
7235500	7238500	Uh, Edgar Mitchell spoke about this.
7238500	7242500	Edgar Mitchell and, uh, uh, Gordon Cooper.
7242500	7244500	Very interesting guys.
7244500	7245500	What's up awakening to reality?
7245500	7246500	How you doing, bro?
7246500	7247500	How you doing?
7247500	7248500	Loud and clear.
7248500	7249500	Okay.
7249500	7250500	I think this is when I just got back.
7250500	7253500	If the feds got me, I'll go kicking and screaming, man.
7253500	7254500	I'll go kicking and screaming.
7254500	7258500	Hey, Jorgen, thank you for the 119 Norwegian Krona.
7258500	7261500	How far back do you believe IC has investigated infiltrated the phenomena?
7261500	7264500	An example did O and I cover the Aurora incident.
7264500	7265500	That's a great question.
7265500	7267500	I'd say at least 1933.
7267500	7278500	Um, the Aurora incident, I think is a case that really warrants a lot of investigation, especially due to some of the circumstantial, not really evidence, but, uh, circumstantial details of the case being really interesting, such as.
7278500	7283500	The idea that some of the craft parts were thrown down a well, which poisoned local residents and so forth.
7283500	7288500	Possibly before then, but I think maybe the earliest we could go is maybe 1897 with the Aurora incident.
7288500	7289500	But thank you again, man.
7289500	7291500	I really appreciate that.
7291500	7293500	What do you think about the UAP tether incident?
7293500	7296500	I knew you did a video on fast workers, but I don't remember if you covered that incident.
7296500	7298500	I don't think I did cover that incident.
7298500	7301500	Now I would actually like to cover the UAP tether incident.
7301500	7308500	Doing yourself a disservice by, uh, contact experiences, maybe look at the content of the experience for you right off as.
7308500	7309500	Okay.
7309500	7310500	I think you might be talking to somebody else.
7310500	7314500	I, because I, I'm just not, not acknowledgeable.
7314500	7315500	Awaken into reality.
7315500	7319500	Thank you so much for the 899, uh, New Zealand dollars.
7319500	7320500	Thank you very much.
7320500	7322500	I really appreciate that, man.
7322500	7325500	The Eiger 1992 alien video is fake.
7325500	7328500	Tristan, I will have to, I absolutely have to watch that.
7328500	7332500	I think Democrat leaders are cock blocked from being briefed on the UFO compared to GOP since they may have balls.
7332500	7335500	Honestly, to further disclose if they get too much information, they're risky.
7335500	7336500	That could be a valid point.
7336500	7340500	I like that hypothesis.
7340500	7344500	Interesting research done at Imperial College in London where different DMTs were used to map out the space.
7344500	7349500	Oh, that is interesting to map out like a, uh, basically create a map of the space.
7349500	7353500	Hey, uh, I got, let me, let me go off on a quick tangent here, guys.
7353500	7358500	Cause I probably won't get to this question about five minutes for any of my gamers in the chat.
7358500	7361500	Have any of you guys played the new war hammer space marines two game?
7361500	7366500	I know I'll get to those questions in about five minutes, but I would like to read if anybody has, has read them.
7366500	7367500	Uh, Von Rennen camp.
7367500	7368500	That's it.
7368500	7372500	He just appeared on a Ross Colt part and yes, I, I can't pronounce stuff.
7372500	7374500	I, I just can't.
7374500	7377500	Did you watch Tom Begert and psychotronics lecture on how to achieve anti-gravity free energy?
7377500	7378500	No, I have not yet.
7378500	7382500	I still need to, I have been consumed with the case I'm working on right now.
7382500	7385500	And that is because it is a 23 page script.
7385500	7388500	So it took me a heck of a long time.
7388500	7393500	Who are the world's best known living intellectual living intellectuals and public speakers?
7393500	7396500	Where are their comments on the phenomenon?
7396500	7397500	Uh, good question.
7397500	7401500	We could go with guys like Sir Roger Penrose and so forth.
7401500	7403500	Some best known living intellectuals.
7403500	7407500	I don't think a lot of them have really, uh, spoken on, on the phenomenon.
7407500	7408500	John Doe.
7408500	7411500	What's going on, brother?
7411500	7413500	Do you believe the skinny Bob alien video?
7413500	7417500	I try and stay away from that until there's, uh, a lot of the topics that have just kind
7417500	7418500	of an endless debate.
7418500	7426500	I try and stay away from just because if my research, if not a lot of research has been
7426500	7430500	advanced on something and maybe my research is just going to get caught in the same loop.
7430500	7435500	Um, I might just kind of wait a little bit until I have something, some actionable information
7435500	7436500	to pursue on, on stuff.
7436500	7438500	And I do not on skinny Bob right now.
7438500	7440500	As a youngster, I loved watching the dang video.
7440500	7441500	I'll tell you that much.
7441500	7445500	America is afraid of the phenomenon is communist Nazi, but they're becoming what they sought
7445500	7446500	to destroy.
7446500	7447500	It's 40 chairs.
7447500	7449500	Absolutely in the cold war and so forth.
7449500	7450500	We absolutely were.
7450500	7451500	Absolutely.
7451500	7454500	It goes all the way back to, uh, project paperclip and Alan Dole's.
7454500	7455500	Yes.
7455500	7458500	Alan Dole is in, uh, the 1933 magenta crash.
7458500	7460500	The door's old boys.
7460500	7463500	Claudio, thank you so much for the 499.
7463500	7464500	My apologies.
7464500	7466500	Donation for going off topic about internships and chat.
7466500	7467500	Keep it up.
7467500	7469500	You and Jesse Michaels be such a good convo.
7469500	7470500	No problem, man.
7470500	7471500	This chat's open to anybody.
7471500	7473500	We're not going to restrict anything.
7473500	7475500	Anybody says, but I really appreciate that.
7475500	7476500	Thank you very much.
7476500	7479500	Twist UAP Leonard Stringfield was one of the best UFO crash researchers.
7479500	7481500	If true, his info is mind blowing.
7481500	7485500	I'd like to take a second and I know I say this in every single video.
7485500	7489500	And in my upcoming video, I will talk about Stringfield at length, but Stringfield is the
7489500	7490500	best of the best.
7490500	7493500	The UFO crash retrievals parts one through seven are sublime.
7493500	7498500	That is what I will stand by as the best ever work done on the subject in terms of crash
7498500	7499500	retrievals.
7499500	7501500	It is phenomenal sublime.
7501500	7502500	Leonard Stringfield is the best.
7502500	7507500	One of my personal dreams is to be able to access his personal records at Mufon Cincinnati,
7507500	7513500	sit with a, with a cold brew for 12 hours and read every single note he ever took.
7513500	7514500	The tether video is wild.
7514500	7515500	Yes.
7516500	7520500	The Cabal's goal is full spectrum of dominance as they say in official documents to achieve
7520500	7522500	that they need the whole world to unite around fear.
7522500	7526500	Perfect way to do that is through a fake ET invasion, or as David Gresh would say, a
7526500	7527500	feudalistic dominance.
7527500	7529500	And, and I agree.
7529500	7534500	I'm still, I still have my problems with, with paper clip or the, I'm sorry, the idea
7534500	7537500	of project blue beam and so forth, but I do understand that point.
7537500	7540500	I do think the, I think the unbearable truth of the phenomenon might be that there's an
7540500	7544500	afterlife for everyone and the unbearable part is where the world collapses due to people
7544500	7545500	self-checking out.
7545500	7547500	I think that was explored in a movie, right?
7547500	7548500	With Jason Seagal.
7548500	7550500	I don't think it was very good, but I think that concept was explored.
7550500	7553500	What would people do if they learned they had an afterlife?
7553500	7554500	That's an interesting idea.
7557500	7560500	Oh, no, no worries with a, no worries with spam.
7560500	7562500	Mrs. Floyd, thank you very much.
7562500	7563500	Yes.
7563500	7564500	There's a lot of Norwegians here.
7564500	7568500	Somebody even recognized the front line shirt, which is great.
7568500	7571500	The Danny Cheehan interview on Jesse Michaels American Alchemy show is amazing.
7571500	7574500	If anyone hasn't watched it, you watch, watch anything by Jesse Michaels.
7574500	7578500	Jesse Michaels is amazing and he has some really cool projects and the work that I think
7578500	7579500	you guys are really going to like.
7579500	7581500	Jesse Michaels is the real deal.
7582500	7583500	Have I played No Man's Sky?
7583500	7585500	One of the best, if not the best space games out there.
7585500	7586500	Yeah.
7586500	7588500	I've played, I've played, I've done like four different playthroughs of it.
7588500	7589500	I love it.
7589500	7593500	There's nothing like having a nice crisp diet cola night and just flying through on your
7593500	7594500	new S-class ship.
7594500	7595500	I love it.
7595500	7600500	Best thing I ate in Japan, that would probably have to be, um, yukatsu.
7600500	7606500	Yukatsu steak where you have steak cooked lightly, lightly fried on the outside with,
7606500	7611500	um, cooked to a rare medium rare and you're given like a hot plate basically to sear it
7611500	7615500	how you want yourself to then dip it in the various sauces.
7615500	7616500	It was sublime.
7616500	7618500	One of the best things I've ever eaten.
7618500	7621500	I feel like right wing presidents would be far more likely to disclose.
7621500	7624500	Conservatives are way, way more wary of big government and government outreach.
7624500	7629500	I agree, but do presidents have the ability to disclose?
7630500	7631500	Penrose is the goat.
7631500	7632500	Absolutely.
7632500	7633500	Physics goat.
7633500	7637500	SDS, 114 UFO video in space is weird.
7637500	7638500	It makes a U-turn.
7638500	7639500	One of the weirdest space.
7639500	7640500	Yeah.
7640500	7641500	I think I put that in the fast walker video.
7641500	7643500	It's a very strange, strange video.
7643500	7647500	If we created simulated realities like video games, why wouldn't the beans above us not do
7647500	7648500	the same?
7648500	7649500	I agree.
7649500	7650500	Sorry.
7650500	7651500	You get a sip of water.
7651500	7652500	Yeah.
7652500	7653500	I agree.
7653500	7659300	I think, um, I can't remember what podcast it was, but there's a man who did a podcast
7659300	7661300	on simulation theory.
7661300	7663300	And one of those was with the ability to simulate.
7663300	7666300	There will be an endless amount of simulations.
7666300	7672300	And we thus have a greater probability of being one of said simulations.
7672300	7673300	But by whom?
7673300	7674300	I don't know.
7674300	7675300	David of Salem.
7675300	7677300	My contact experience was a possible one.
7677300	7680300	They seemed to take it back that I could see them as I was.
7680300	7682300	It was like we abducted each other rather than mine.
7682300	7687300	I think I've heard that in some abduction cases of, of beans almost being surprised that they
7687300	7688300	were, they have been noticed.
7688300	7689300	Cheers from Norway.
7689300	7690300	Cheers to you.
7690300	7692300	I hope to be back to, to Norway soon, man.
7692300	7695300	I love that some Norwegians watch, watch this channel.
7695300	7699300	It's, um, thoughts on the tall whites.
7699300	7700300	The tall whites are interesting.
7700300	7704300	Um, of course, with many gray sightings of abductees and so forth, there's a lot of the
7704300	7709300	time like a tall white, as some people say, like venusians, mantis type beans alongside
7709300	7711300	the, the gray, the drones.
7711300	7715300	I don't know what to think because abductions isn't really my bread and butter.
7715300	7719300	I still am just trying to investigate what the heck are some of the bodies that are discovered
7719300	7720300	at some of the crash sites.
7720300	7722300	Phil Snyder, we talked about this before.
7722300	7724300	Some of his claims are, are very interesting.
7724300	7726300	They're very big too.
7726300	7727300	His claims are very big.
7727300	7732300	And, uh, in terms of getting into a firefight underground with NHI where soldiers were basically
7732300	7734300	turned to goop, uh, alongside him.
7734300	7740300	But I have, I'm, I'm probably would start with researching his death if I do, if I do some
7740300	7741300	research into him.
7741300	7745300	The skinny Bob looks like CGI to me, but I want to believe that one.
7745300	7746300	It does.
7746300	7747300	It looks a little buttery.
7747300	7749300	It looks a little buttery.
7749300	7755300	Hey, dude, I hope the Browns lose because the bangles got beat by one of the worst teams
7755300	7756300	in the NFL today.
7756300	7759300	And I'm very upset.
7759300	7761300	We're skyfire, skyfire news.
7761300	7762300	I'm not quite sure.
7762300	7764300	I am not quite sure.
7764300	7768300	Matilda O'Donnell Roswell interview mentioned a gray, didn't know English till I read the
7768300	7771300	book that night and they were, uh, over the White House.
7771300	7772300	Yeah.
7772300	7774300	And what they, what were they over the White House?
7774300	7779300	Um, a lot of Roswell witnesses, including the, um, including the photographer at Roswell
7779300	7780300	mentioned grays.
7780300	7783300	They are forced for peace and nuclear disarmament.
7783300	7785300	They try and promote a message of peace.
7785300	7787300	They could have various effects on electronics on off.
7787300	7788300	Yeah.
7788300	7792300	Kevin Knuth at his soul foundation, uh, did a lot of interesting talk about this with
7792300	7797300	electric fields and magnetic fields of UAP and they're interacting with technology and
7797300	7800300	so forth.
7800300	7801300	Okay.
7801300	7803300	Sorry.
7803300	7805300	Project blue beam is disinformation.
7805300	7807300	I tend to lead towards this too.
7807300	7808300	It was made up by Dottie.
7808300	7809300	I didn't know that.
7809300	7817300	Um, I blue beam, at least in my experience has been used by people I know who want to
7817300	7819300	discount, um, UFOs.
7819300	7824300	And I know in that comment, I said, like, I could understand, uh, the utilizing of a
7824300	7829300	invasion for fear, but I still think that that is mainly based off of Reagan's Reagan
7829300	7831300	speech and, uh, disinformation.
7831300	7834300	If skinny Bob is faked is incredibly well done.
7834300	7836300	When I met them, they looked just like that.
7836300	7837300	Interesting.
7837300	7839300	Convincing for so long.
7839300	7840300	That's a good point.
7840300	7844300	It could only be, uh, it could only be for convincing as long as the holograms could, could
7844300	7846300	stay up in the, in the air.
7846300	7852300	Um, maybe, uh, the weird after effects on skinny Bob.
7852300	7855300	I've heard of those.
7855300	7859300	It was any Jacobson that said the Roswell crash was rushing towards and Dottie to an
7859300	7860300	unacknowledged of Greer.
7860300	7865300	But I think, uh, uh, any Jacobson said that recently on her Sean Ryan appearance, I think
7865300	7869300	it was, and she was on, uh, Jerry, Jonathan Reed footage.
7869300	7874300	Uh, listen, I heard of Jonathan Reed a long time ago on mysterious universe.
7874300	7877300	If you guys know, uh, that podcast, it's great.
7877300	7881300	And his story was, I think a lot of, I almost posited.
7881300	7884300	This is Jonathan Reed story because of the NHI body.
7884300	7888300	Jonathan Reed claims to have a, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, because if I am, I'll retract
7888300	7889300	my statement right away.
7889300	7894300	But Jonathan Reed claims to have slain a, uh, a, a creature that, that creature he has
7894300	7896300	photographed with a samurai sword.
7896300	7899300	I believe that's what he said and then put it on nice.
7899300	7906300	Uh, and also the photos of the wedge shaped craft are very weirdly proportioned, very
7906300	7908300	weirdly proportioned.
7908300	7911300	Uh, so many good videos ruined with crap editing.
7911300	7912300	Yeah.
7912300	7913300	I tend to agree.
7913300	7915300	I tend to agree.
7915300	7919300	I held Roswell foil to it heats when flame took the same as cutting metal holding the
7919300	7920300	hand.
7920300	7921300	You held Roswell material.
7921300	7924300	I would like to hear, I would like to hear more about that.
7924300	7927300	What's the best thing I ate at a gas station in Norway and did you get it?
7927300	7931300	Or what's the best thing you ate in Norway and did you eat at a gas station for all my
7931300	7932300	Norwegians out there?
7932300	7934300	You will know what a hot dog on Lumpa is.
7934300	7939300	And that's like a Norwegian bread tortilla that gas stations, but hot dogs on it.
7939300	7940300	And then they're so good.
7940300	7941300	They're amazing.
7941300	7944300	They are amazing.
7944300	7947300	Also wanted to tell you about two picks of alleged dead aliens I saw.
7947300	7950800	They reminded me of one from EBEs described in the MJ 12 manual, the non gray ones will
7950800	7951800	send them on discord.
7951800	7953300	I would love to, I would excuse me.
7953300	7955300	I would love to see that please.
7955300	7959300	Did you see the video of the UFO in orbit that gets shot up by some weapon?
7959300	7960300	Yeah.
7960300	7961300	Like the kind of like light beam.
7961300	7962300	Yes, I have seen that.
7962300	7966300	And I don't know what to make of it because I haven't spent too much time looking at it.
7966300	7970300	I think it was, it was in not lost century.
7970300	7972300	Was it in unacknowledged?
7972300	7976300	Take a look at UAP Gerb's eyes.
7976300	7978300	He is a Pleiadian alien.
7978300	7979300	That'd be cool, man.
7979300	7980300	I wish I was.
7980300	7985300	If I was, I'd be the first to tell you, but I am just a human.
7985300	7987300	I would like to see the original skinny Bob video.
7987300	7989300	I wonder where that has obviously been cropped down.
7989300	7994300	I would like to as well, but it with a, with those videos, this just, at least for me,
7994300	7996300	I couldn't come to a conclusion.
7996300	7999300	So it'd be difficult for me to engage thoughts on the tall whites.
7999300	8001300	Very interesting to me.
8001300	8005300	I'm still trying to start out what the heck kind of the graves or the small creatures,
8005300	8007300	the EBE type ones and twos are.
8007300	8012300	And then we will get to the kind of description of the mantis type beings or the tall, tall
8012300	8015300	graves or venusians and so forth.
8015300	8019300	The problem with new wave of UFO experts is they don't understand the science of free
8019300	8020300	energy, anti-gravity.
8020300	8021300	They could easily be deceived.
8021300	8023300	Any saucer that attacks us would be considered ET.
8023300	8030300	I do agree that a lot of new wave UFO folks don't necessarily understand the physics
8030300	8032300	behind UAP and kind of ARV.
8032300	8033300	I certainly don't.
8033300	8037300	I'll be the first to admit that physics is never, never my strong suit.
8037300	8039300	The book identifies companies and crafts still secret.
8039300	8045300	Bob Dean had the book in foil 1988 England.
8045300	8048300	I think the whole bad abduction versus good abduction experience is similar to having good
8048300	8049300	versus bad trips on psychedelics.
8049300	8053300	That's an, that is an interesting point.
8053300	8057300	I believe most abductions in beds are most likely sleep paralysis.
8057300	8059300	I have heard this too.
8059300	8063300	Again, I like, I don't want to discount anyone's abduction experience.
8063300	8068300	So I don't know what the heck to think, but they very well could be sleep paralysis.
8068300	8070300	Las Vegas alien video.
8070300	8073300	I don't think anything ever came of that.
8073300	8074300	Right.
8074300	8082300	I think Steven Dean or Steven donor on Twitter said he had was interviewing the person who
8082300	8083300	took that footage.
8083300	8084300	Right.
8084300	8086300	But I don't think anything ever came of that.
8086300	8090300	If I'm, if I'm remembering correctly, I stayed far away from that in the Miami mall stuff.
8090300	8095300	Um, just wasn't not, not the sort of case I, I'd be investigating world of the world's
8095300	8098300	movie is similar to the event where people were attacked and have blood drawn.
8098300	8099300	Yeah.
8099300	8103300	The world of the world's the Tom Cruise version that came out in 2005 scared the crap out of
8103300	8105300	me as a little kid that scared me so bad.
8105300	8108300	What's the best publicly available UFO video you've seen?
8108300	8113300	Um, that's a tough one just because I've kind of moved so far away from videos.
8113300	8117300	I'd say right now it's probably the video of the, the triangle I always post.
8117300	8120300	I can't remember exactly where that video was taken, but late at night triangle with
8120300	8124300	three points of light on each vertex with one red light in the middle.
8124300	8126300	I think that's a fantastic video.
8126300	8128300	Fantastic.
8128300	8130300	The whole invasion.
8130300	8131300	Yeah.
8131300	8132300	I agree with this.
8132300	8136300	I've said this before that the only, uh, blue beam claims are to point to, uh, to Reagan
8136300	8140300	speech when he addressed the UN and said, I can't think of how quickly, uh, the world
8140300	8143300	would come together with the threat of an alien invasion.
8143300	8144300	Yeah.
8144300	8145300	Okay.
8145300	8148300	So this is with, uh, Jonathan Reed and the samurai sword.
8148300	8149300	Yeah.
8149300	8153300	That's been conveniently left out with a read story of a wedge kind of coming back and
8153300	8157300	being popular with, with loose book in the description of the wedge shaped craft.
8157300	8161300	He did say he sl, he slayed the, the creature with a samurai sword.
8161300	8162300	Reply to abduction comment.
8162300	8166300	You can go on board the craft by a telepathic mind link via unseen plane of existence out
8166300	8167300	of body consciousness.
8167300	8171300	The same way ETs talk to people telepathically with the utilization of P three assets.
8171300	8172300	I wouldn't be surprised.
8175300	8176300	He used a big branch.
8176300	8177300	Ah, okay.
8177300	8181300	Maybe I was wrong about the sword, but he still slayed it with a club.
8181300	8183300	Still slayed it with a club.
8183300	8186300	Do I think I would look at some of John max abduction cases?
8186300	8187300	Absolutely.
8187300	8188300	I'd like to tackle the abduction phenomena.
8188300	8190300	It's just, there's so much to do.
8190300	8194300	So I really need to make sure we get in at a good time to, to focus fully on the abduction
8194300	8195300	phenomena.
8195300	8198300	The read teleportation video is whack, big whack.
8198300	8199300	Yeah.
8199300	8202300	I've seen it and I'll watch it again and I'll keep watching it, but there's a little whack.
8202300	8206300	Project blue beam was not made by Dodie and disinfo usaps won't just use holograms.
8206300	8207300	They'll use ARVs PLC.
8207300	8211300	I think, yeah, this is, this is what a career would state, right?
8211300	8217300	Especially with, with this TE or ET, I can't quite remember and the fake, the PLF abduction
8217300	8221300	he occurred when he left the Nellis retrieval team.
8221300	8226300	Chevrolet being locking Martin naps built a cannabis and blue book wonder if Hitler had
8226300	8227300	them before the reverse engineering.
8227300	8228300	I don't know.
8228300	8234300	I had a, a good friend asked me earlier about a kind of Nazis and UAP reverse engineering.
8234300	8238300	And besides hunt for his zero point and the stories of deep lock, I really haven't spent
8238300	8240300	too much time, too much time researching.
8240300	8242300	Well, Grush's op-ed come out this year.
8242300	8243300	I truly hope so.
8243300	8245300	I truly hope so.
8245300	8247300	Will it be, is it still stuck in Dobser?
8247300	8248300	I'm not quite sure.
8248300	8251300	Now Grush is definitely not, not being lazy.
8251300	8257300	I definitely think he is doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but I truly hope so.
8257300	8261300	If the teleportation video didn't exist, the alien body would have to be significantly
8261300	8262300	more credible.
8262300	8264300	Unfortunately, dude decided to write a weird hype train to nowhere.
8264300	8265300	Yes.
8265300	8269300	Have you seen the Sentinel Arizona footage recorded by Nick Williams?
8269300	8273300	I don't think so, but I would like to see that.
8273300	8277300	That was a ET UFO being shot with scalar waves and EM system weapons.
8277300	8279300	That's the situation for almost a century.
8279300	8280300	Yes.
8280300	8281300	I have, I have heard that as well.
8281300	8288300	And I'm, I'm coming to start to really, really seriously research that topic of, of scalar
8288300	8292300	weapons and kind of what Greer sets about targeting craft.
8292300	8294300	Plasma propulsion, MHD plasma.
8294300	8298300	If I'm being correct, I think Oak Shannon has some notes on this that operate in like
8298300	8302300	the 3.5 gigahertz range, creates a cloud, which they use as camouflage and to cool down
8302300	8303300	the craft.
8303300	8310300	Now what I have heard is that early types of ARVs used MHD Plasma Stopper Pulsion when
8310300	8314300	later configurations have used actual like anti-gravity techniques.
8314300	8317300	Do I have anything to back that up or any evidence or research that?
8317300	8319300	No, but I've heard that before.
8319300	8325300	MH370, I think we'll probably stay away from, from MH370 on the channel.
8325300	8330300	I think it's just a, it's very toxic, toxic subject at the moment.
8330300	8331300	Oh yeah.
8331300	8335300	Reed stated his dog was turned to ash.
8335300	8341300	That also reminds me of the 1950s Maori incident where I think a saucer discharged material.
8341300	8345300	I can't remember if that case was labeled as a hoax or not or found to be, but where
8345300	8348300	material allegedly hit a dog.
8348300	8351300	Any update on Jesse, you and Jesse Michaels collaborating.
8351300	8354300	I will be meeting Jesse tomorrow or Tuesday.
8354300	8360300	I'm not quite sure which day yet and I will have an update then.
8361300	8362300	What about the phenomena?
8362300	8367300	Would you like to research the most aside from UAP, psionics, remote viewing?
8367300	8374300	So that's tough because crash retrieval and reverse engineering are what I like the most.
8374300	8379300	At this point, I'd probably like to go down and I'll say, I'll throw in ARVs.
8379300	8382300	I can't throw ARVs in there as well because I want to research that.
8382300	8387300	And I'll, I'll take, I want to research dumps, deep underground military bases.
8387300	8391300	Oh, that green footage, but that footage is really cool too with the triangle scene
8391300	8393300	from almost kind of height level.
8393300	8397300	Yeah, that's a great, that's a, that's like a great video.
8397300	8403300	But you remember, there's like a ball of light in the middle that I think expands.
8403300	8407300	And like, I think I'm, I think that's the video you're talking about.
8407300	8409300	Let me know if, let me know if I'm right here.
8409300	8412300	I could be wrong, but I think that's the video you're talking about, the green one.
8412300	8416300	Trying to get my GF into the subject and watch the first minute black last night had some interesting themes in it.
8416300	8418300	The first minute black is a fantastic film.
8418300	8420300	I really want to rewatch that with the lady.
8420300	8422300	It's a fantastic film.
8422300	8425300	And guys, I'll get through these questions maybe in about 10 minutes.
8425300	8427300	I'll have to hop off, but we'll get through all of these.
8427300	8432300	I promise meeting Bob Dean and after holding Roswell foil and saw pages of a few pages of blue.
8432300	8434300	But remember who has gone for 20 years.
8434300	8435300	The foil stretches like a razor.
8435300	8436300	I cut myself.
8436300	8437300	I don't remember that.
8437300	8442300	Now I'd like to hear how, how did you get your hands on, on, on said foil?
8442300	8447300	And what have there been research done on this specific, specific piece you held?
8447300	8448300	What's up, Zach?
8448300	8449300	How you doing rewatch?
8449300	8450300	Yes.
8450300	8452300	I highly recommend starting from beginning right now.
8452300	8457300	We're just chatting answering questions, but earlier we, we went through the entire gray or talk today.
8457300	8458300	I bought the pay-per-view.
8458300	8459300	So you didn't have to.
8459300	8465300	And we kind of, I took screenshots of every single PowerPoint slide and we went through the whole dang thing.
8465300	8467300	The whole thing.
8467300	8469300	Have you watched the recent weaponized with Corbel?
8469300	8474300	They discussed an event in 2000 where people were attacked by UFOs that took blood from them and shine beams.
8474300	8475300	That's not the color.
8475300	8476300	That's not the Brazil instead.
8476300	8477300	Right.
8477300	8481300	I haven't listened to weaponized in a while, but I would like to listen to that.
8481300	8482300	That's Brazil.
8482300	8483300	Correct.
8483300	8484300	Yeah.
8484300	8489300	I haven't, I don't think since the start of the year I've listened and listened to weaponized.
8489300	8490300	Oh, the turkey video.
8490300	8491300	Yeah.
8491300	8497300	With Chris Leto back in the day, did a great video actually like identifying the angle at
8497300	8500300	which this video was recorded, the position where it was recorded.
8500300	8501300	I highly recommend checking that out.
8501300	8503300	It's an old Chris Leto video.
8503300	8507300	I think from early 2023 mid 2023, it's fantastic.
8507300	8509300	Are they among us like big low suggests?
8509300	8510300	Quite possibly.
8510300	8514300	Do I have any research or evidence to back that up or have an informed opinion?
8514300	8515300	No.
8515300	8519300	Do not do a video on the clock.
8519300	8521300	I'd like to, of course it, uh, the clock.
8521300	8525300	There's a lot of relation to the Kecksburg case in terms of general design.
8525300	8529300	I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to include that in the Kecksburg case or make
8529300	8533300	a video on its own about the Glock.
8533300	8536300	We met photons and radiation, uh, probably into the stratosphere.
8536300	8538300	Craft would redirect the brain waves.
8538300	8539300	Possibly.
8539300	8540300	Sentinel footage.
8540300	8542300	Um, Chloris Brazil.
8542300	8543300	Yeah.
8543300	8544300	Okay.
8544300	8545300	Okay.
8545300	8546300	Yeah.
8546300	8547300	Yeah.
8547300	8548300	Yeah.
8548300	8549300	Yeah.
8549300	8550300	I was thinking the same thing, the Chloris Brazil incident.
8550300	8551300	And I think that, uh, I got popular again because Lou spoke about it in his book.
8551300	8552300	Right.
8552300	8553300	Um, was it Lou?
8553300	8554300	I believe so.
8554300	8555300	It's a great movie.
8555300	8557300	MIB one, especially when the face opens and the little alien is revealed.
8557300	8558300	Yeah.
8558300	8559300	That's a classic.
8559300	8560300	The tiny little alien MIB ones.
8560300	8561300	Great.
8561300	8564300	It scared me really bad when I was a child though.
8564300	8568300	Jacques Valet and forbidden science for, um, has secured a document confirming the CIA
8568300	8571300	performed fake alien abductions in Argentina and Brazil for psychological work.
8571300	8573300	I would really like to see this document if you have that.
8573300	8574300	I've, I've never seen it.
8574300	8576300	Um, I'll put the discord link in here again.
8576300	8579300	I know I'll put it twice, but I would actually really like to read that document.
8579300	8580300	Please.
8580300	8582300	If you have it on hand, otherwise I have a copy of forbidden science for it.
8582300	8583300	I'll just find it.
8583300	8588300	They must see in UV light reaction times more like it.
8588300	8589300	Let's see.
8589300	8590300	They're seen.
8590300	8593300	Let's see.
8593300	8596800	What are the consequences of the Collins elite are correct in their findings and the phenomenon
8596800	8598740	is largely your entirely demonic.
8598740	8601060	The consequences of that are just awful.
8601060	8607180	That means we, uh, that mean, I don't even want to face the, the, the consequences of
8607180	8609340	the UAP phenomenon being a demonic.
8609340	8616340	That is almost too terrifying for a man like myself to think about, but very, very bad consequences.
8616340	8620840	If that's the truth, David favor said that he was part of a big upcoming UFO documentary,
8620840	8621840	not James Fox's.
8621840	8623340	I have heard that supposedly coming out soon.
8623340	8624340	And he said it was very interesting.
8624340	8625640	There was some podcasts with Ryan graves.
8625640	8626640	I heard that as well.
8626640	8628740	There's also a Bob Lazar documentary coming out.
8628740	8630940	Of course the program with James Fox is coming out.
8630940	8635580	I think everybody in their grandmother is looking forward to that one and Jesse Michaels saw
8635580	8636740	it.
8636740	8642440	So if Jesse Michaels can give me any deets, I can share with you guys, I absolutely will.
8642440	8645140	Maybe an ongoing YouTube playlist of the best craft videos people have ever captured would
8645140	8646140	be a cool thing.
8646140	8647140	That would be cool.
8647140	8648140	Yeah.
8648140	8650980	Actually, cause I know I include a lot of craft sightings as B role, but like a full video
8650980	8651980	would be great.
8651980	8654440	I've seen a triangle UAP it's he man made.
8654440	8657640	What signified that I would actually like to hear that.
8657640	8659940	Do I watch UAP content or only research it for YouTube?
8659940	8662180	I do not really watch.
8662180	8663180	Here's the thing.
8663180	8666720	I don't watch UAP content because I'm always reading a UAP book.
8666720	8672460	Every second of every night and day doing the UAP book or just taking a endless amount
8672460	8678080	of notes on on a sightings or projects I'm working on.
8678080	8680140	So it's I need a little bit of a break at that time.
8680140	8681880	So I don't consume too much UAP content.
8681880	8687520	I'll I'll watch YouTube for for dumb stuff like maybe some games or stuff like that.
8687520	8691160	I was at my friend's house after school and Bob Dean was a friend of his.
8691160	8692160	Wow.
8692160	8693160	That's incredible.
8693160	8694160	That's very cool.
8694160	8696160	Yo, what up JC?
8696160	8699200	What up, dude?
8699200	8703640	There are metamaterials which go through plasma excitation become room temp semiconductors
8703640	8705200	on a quantum scale and defy gravity.
8705200	8706920	I'll join discord and send some links.
8706920	8707920	Please do.
8707920	8708920	I'd like to learn more.
8708920	8709920	If you can help teach me.
8709920	8710920	Absolutely.
8710920	8711920	Please.
8711920	8714720	I'd like to learn and if you're willing to help please William.
8714720	8715720	What's up, dude?
8715720	8716720	You made my day for showing up.
8716720	8717720	Thanks, man.
8717720	8718720	Christian Morales.
8718720	8719720	You missed quite a bit.
8719720	8723640	I would highly recommend going back to the very beginning of the video because for the
8723640	8729600	first hour and 20 minutes we talked solely about Greer's presentation today in London.
8729600	8733040	I took screenshots of everything and we discussed everything in it.
8733040	8734800	So there's a lot there to look at.
8734800	8736800	Gryffindor Beatles.
8736800	8740400	There's one of it doing 900 miles and our people might be real sciences.
8740400	8741400	Interesting.
8741400	8743760	Cows would call us demonic, right?
8743760	8744760	Probably.
8744760	8745760	Yes.
8745760	8751920	Why do you think Lula as honest as Big Lowe is an American hero when it seems to me he
8751920	8754560	is doing the exact same thing as the legacy program.
8754560	8756680	Specifically he takes in all the info and uses it for wealth.
8756680	8758600	Yeah, that's true, especially with Kona Blue.
8758600	8762880	Who knows if Big Lowe Aerospace was actually going to share the materials it was supposed
8762880	8766920	to receive from Lockheed Martin.
8766920	8767920	I don't know why.
8767920	8773000	Some of the stuff with the TTSA crew is a little strange to me, especially Big Lowe Aerospace.
8773000	8775280	You guys know how Greer gets shepherded by Rand Pandolfi?
8775280	8781800	I do not and I would like to hear.
8781800	8788760	Have you ever considered seismic data to quantify triangulate known crash sites?
8788760	8792800	I have your research, Mr. Floyd, but I have not gone through that yet, but I think that's
8792800	8794920	a very good route to go down.
8794920	8799320	I know the current case I'm working on, Kecksburg, has recorded seismic data.
8799320	8803000	I don't have the actual data, but it was referenced in the Blue Book report on the case.
8803000	8804920	So I actually think that's very worthwhile.
8804920	8807840	That's a great research avenue.
8807840	8810280	Project Gravitar should be entertaining, aesthetically pleasing if nothing else.
8810440	8815880	This is the Badozzar documentary with a full VR recreation of the sports model to explore
8815880	8817880	digitally, which is awesome.
8817880	8819720	That's going to be really cool.
8819720	8822920	At what age did you get hooked on the UFO topic and why, since I could read?
8822920	8827880	I've said this a lot, but ever since I was able to read, I had some UFO sightings books
8827880	8830080	specifically mentioned of Betty and Barney Hill.
8830080	8835760	I remember reading about that case from a very young age, and I've just always been incredibly
8835760	8837960	fascinated with the phenomenon.
8838960	8843040	Okay, we'll get through these and then in a couple of minutes we'll hit the road gang,
8843040	8846080	headed to the weird desk after Kit Green, Pandolfi is dangerous and has imitated and
8846080	8847240	scared a lot of people.
8847240	8850600	He shepherds Greer because Greer is so controversial, it helps the gatekeepers.
8850600	8851600	Interesting.
8851600	8855320	I'll have to do some more research on that, absolutely.
8855320	8859280	One thing that stumps me about the whole triangle being man-made Arabies, why TF are they flying
8859280	8862320	them at Low Altitude or Highway so everyone can see it makes no sense?
8862320	8863880	Yes, that's actually a great question.
8863880	8868160	So many people who talk about having triangle sightings talk about these being observed
8868160	8872320	over such low altitudes, hundreds of feet.
8872320	8875040	In the interest of not wanting to be seen, that seems very strange.
8875040	8880760	It's also strange how triangular sightings don't really pop up until the 1950s.
8880760	8888440	Bob Lazar said the sports model is a Hanoubi MK4, the fastest craft, Lazar don't say Hanoubi.
8888440	8890640	I didn't know that.
8890640	8891880	What do you think of the new Aero director?
8891880	8893400	I know he's in league with Jay Stratton.
8893400	8901200	I know he also made some rather silly comments on LinkedIn as his first act of Aero director.
8901200	8902880	With Aero, we're not going to get anything different.
8902880	8906960	It's going to be more of the same, probably.
8906960	8910000	Gerb said that if the Trump wins, he will release good picks of UFOs.
8910000	8913120	I know he said that, but is he going to be able to declassify them?
8913120	8917840	Chris Mellon, David Grosh, Lousano have all talked about 4K UFO footage presumably taken
8917840	8922040	from the NRO that is classified and will not be released.
8922040	8925520	I definitely take that with a grain of salt, but I would love that.
8925520	8927920	Will I ever make a video about the UFO in your profile picture?
8927920	8930360	Yes, the Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Saucer sightings?
8930360	8931360	Yes, I would.
8931360	8937040	That's probably the one photo set I'd make a video on, just because it's so fascinating.
8937040	8940160	Big Lowe seems like he hardly cares about disclosure, he has a ton of info, but doesn't
8940160	8941160	care to reveal what it is.
8941160	8942160	I agree.
8942160	8948960	He seems to be more just doing consciousness after death studies and more passion projects.
8948960	8951440	He doesn't seem well vested in disclosure.
8951440	8955040	Magic Book was MI5 and MI6.IF.
8955040	8958240	Does everything go to Royal Air Force bases too?
8958240	8959240	I don't know.
8959240	8961240	That's actually a good question.
8961240	8964880	Besides the witness we talked about in Greer's stuff earlier, BK, I'm actually not familiar
8964880	8970960	with any UK bases that might be a place in which crash retrievals, biologics maybe, store
8971760	8972760	it.
8972760	8976800	I got hooked on the UFO subject when I seen three UFOs flying doing strange maneuvers
8976800	8978480	in Lithuania in the early 2000s.
8978480	8979480	Love the content, keep it up.
8979480	8980480	Thank you, man.
8980480	8981480	Thank you very much.
8981480	8982400	Three UFOs doing strange maneuvers.
8982400	8983400	What kind of maneuvers?
8983400	8985640	That sounds fascinating.
8985640	8986640	Opinions on Green Street.
8986640	8990360	We talked about this earlier, and I think I probably talk about this every episode.
8990360	8995720	I think he has some sort of Department of Defense Pentagon ties.
8995720	9000360	He also seems like a guy who got burned that is trying to take revenge on UFO players.
9001280	9006960	There's something to be said about the fact he includes the phrase spooky alien space monsters
9006960	9009120	and 8 out of 10 tweets he does.
9009120	9011120	I'm not the biggest fan of Green Street.
9013120	9017360	Before 2017, Greer used to always say that one day they'll do a fake disclosure.
9017360	9021360	They'll start saying UFOs are a threat happening in 2017, happening now in another coincidence.
9021360	9026160	This probably parallels with the fact that Greer has a huge beef with Lou, which we talked
9026160	9029920	about a little bit earlier, but yeah, those are probably direct connections.
9031920	9037360	Tier 3B triangular, but around Hanubi would glow triangle balls with a cube to steer magnets.
9037360	9043360	Interesting, cube, sort of like the cube within a sphere like Greer speaks about.
9044520	9048000	A president has no power to bring disclosure because of the Atomic Energy Act.
9048000	9053520	The app trans classified as foreign nuclear materials, and there's an Obama classification.
9053520	9055320	I can't remember what classification.
9055360	9058840	Executive order, I can't remember what it was called.
9058840	9063720	I'll post it in the Discord, but that there's a mandatory aversion to declassification
9063720	9069520	with anything dealing with non-human technologies, which could reference NHI or AI or both.
9069520	9072720	Bigelow isn't about disclosure, but he's seen some disturbing stuff.
9073520	9075880	Man, his wife was allegedly killed to the hitchhiker effect.
9075880	9079120	Interesting, I have not pursued his wife's death.
9079120	9080560	That is really interesting.
9081960	9082680	Yeah, the same.
9082680	9083480	I had no idea.
9084480	9087120	I've seen the moon disappear and pop up in a different place.
9087120	9088120	That is interesting.
9089480	9090080	Here's the link.
9090080	9090840	Okay, thank you.
9091480	9092760	I'll check that out, my man.
9096760	9104680	My step-granddad posted Magic 12 to MJ12 in the 90s, but book was all black inked.
9105960	9112760	So your granddad had in hands a Magic 12 book, but that was heavily redacted.
9112880	9113560	That is interesting.
9113560	9114440	I would like to hear more.
9116240	9117600	You should check out Soccer 96.
9117600	9119840	They're super into the topic and have a track with Salami Rose.
9119840	9121800	Absolutely, that sounds great.
9121800	9125160	Anybody I can look into more.
9125680	9128120	Guys, at this point, we will take some time to sign off.
9128120	9130000	We've been doing this for about two and a half hours.
9130920	9135160	Like I said, we'll be doing a stream of just about every Sunday, maybe every Monday.
9135440	9138720	Whenever there's a big event like this, Greer stuff, I will always kind of use the
9138720	9143680	live to cover it, do that for a video for a live instead of just kind of research
9143680	9147000	because I like my videos to be huge research projects.
9147440	9152080	And with that, guys, yeah, with that big low statement about his wife, if anybody's
9152080	9154400	in the Discord, we'll continue to talk about it there.
9154760	9157480	With that, guys, I want to say I really appreciate the support on the channel.
9157480	9160640	Thank you guys so much for showing up, watching this to our live stream.
9160880	9164760	I know Kai, I know something or someone have kind of been here since the very start.
9164760	9169840	So I really appreciate everyone being here and expect a new video this week.
9169880	9171000	I'm hoping to get it done.
9171440	9174320	I was hoping to get it done today, but it might be Wednesday.
9174320	9177120	We get it out just because it got some stuff going on with Jesse.
9177640	9178880	It's going to be a bit of a busy week.
9178880	9181640	So we'll get that video out and then some some other stuff in the work.
9181640	9185280	Thank you guys all so much for showing up to the stream and I will catch everybody later.
9185680	9186480	All right, see you guys.
