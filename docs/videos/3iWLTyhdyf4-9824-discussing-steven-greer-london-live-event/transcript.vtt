WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Yo, yo, let me see if we are live.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I can never get this right, can I?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Live.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
All right.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
What's up, everybody?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
What up, Colin from Dubai?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
How you doing, man?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, what up, John?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
John, Mr. Pico Graham.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Hey, tell Jones to stop ducking Aspenall.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm sick and tired of it.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
We're going to let some more people filter in.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm trying to kick a pretty foul mood at the moment.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
If you guys don't know, I'm a big American football fan

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
and my team, the Cincinnati Bengals, just got smoked to a dreadful team.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
So we're just going to be, and I spent four and a half hours this morning

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
watching Greer.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
So it's just been a strange day.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Well, we'll get through it.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Got a cold brew.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
What are you guys up to, anyone?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Do anything fun this weekend?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Got anything going on?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Let me adjust my lighting a little bit.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
And the lecture was really interesting.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
I have notes on every single aspect of the entire four hours.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
So we're going to go through it kind of line by line.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I have screenshots from the entire thing,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
and I kind of want to break down each of the PowerPoint slides

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
and tricks in my hand.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Any advice for new content creators?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I am still a new content creator,

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
and it's just kind of figuring it out as you go.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I don't know if there's any answer, man.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I still don't know what the heck I'm doing, to be honest.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Watching NFL?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, let's...

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I hate the sport.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I hate football, but I'll be watching next week.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
What up, Alexander?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
How you doing, man?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Jones will never fight.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I know, and he's ducking him,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
because John Jones knows he'd get smoked and knocked out in the first.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
You went to a seven-hour general assembly of a political party.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You got in a word, hey, that's awesome, man,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
for what subject, representing, or...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
That's really cool.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Greetings from Germany.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Hey, what's up, man?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I've only been to Frankfurt in Germany, and I loved it.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Four and a half hours with Greer is enough to sour anyone's day.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, when we get into it, it'll probably be really interesting to you.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
The presentation was split up into halves.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So the first half of the webinar was talking all about,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
you know, the program, black programs, black sites that Greer wanted to discuss.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
And the entire second half was about kind of new age stuff, consciousness, and so forth.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
But we got all the slides.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
We'll go through everything.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Soon 10K, I hope.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So, Gluten, you got the flu, dude?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
What happened?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I feel like you're...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
This is my friend, Gluten.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I feel like you're ill just about every week.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
So I don't...

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I hope you're all right.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Doing great.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Love your deep dives.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Thank you.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I appreciate that.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
We got one coming out soon this week, very soon.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Hello from Canada.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
What's up, dude?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
What part of Canada?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Two lives.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I did.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I promised everybody we'd be doing one live a week.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And I intend to keep that promise.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Just a general memory till...

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
That's awesome.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
And you're from Iceland, correct?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I love it.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Wilder side.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
What's up, dude?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Hello from Dubai.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Event Horizon.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
What's up?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
If you guys don't know Event Horizon, this is John Michael Goode.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And his wonderful producer, Ross, I highly...

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I mean, I'm sure you guys know about John's channel and the Event Horizon podcast.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Both of these men are excellent individuals.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
And I can't wait to be talking about him more in the future.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
If you guys don't know Event Horizon, go watch any episode.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Any of John Michael Goode's videos on the Fermi Paradox are instant classics.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
And I highly recommend them.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
John is a huge inspiration for my channel in terms of just how he treats every video

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
almost like a research paper.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
It doesn't have any BS, kind of just the facts approach.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Not really slick editing to kind of trick people with clickbait or anything like that,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
but just stick straight to discussing the topic.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I love John Michael Goode.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
All right.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Living in Malta near the border, British Columbia.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That's awesome.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I love it in the private party.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
That's awesome, man.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Congrats.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Originally from Arkansas, living in Malta.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Oh, thank you so much, Rod.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I know you.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I really appreciate it.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Skip the matinee.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
What were you seeing?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Alien, Beetlejuice.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I don't know what else is out at the moment.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Event Horizon does rock.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
John Michael Goode rocks.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Absolutely is awesome.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
6 a.m. or where are you?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Are you in Asia or Hawaii?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
I was trying to do this one a little bit earlier so we could get some of the EU fellers

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
and especially because this program had to do with London.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Thank you, Ross and John.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I will talk to you guys soon.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I appreciate that, man.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Really appreciate it.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Have I ever seen Janet's YouTube channel?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Very interesting, clear footage of UAPs.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
I've heard of the channel, but I haven't sat through and watched a ton of the videos.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I will have to though.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
There's just so much to analyze lately without even touching footage.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Recently, I talked to John and Ross from Event Horizon.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
That's something that all of us are on the same page on.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
A lot of the times, footage is useful or useless for furthering the conversation.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Thanks, Ross.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I appreciate that, man.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Thank you very much.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Much love.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Thank you for the support.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
It's awesome.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Greetings from the UK.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yes.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Perfect.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I wanted some of my friends from across the pond in here.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
That's wonderful.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Can you do a video where you analyze Green Street and other skeptics claims?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Absolutely.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'd love to.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Green Street is a strange one.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
There's something that makes me irrationally angry whenever I see a tweet of his because

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
I know it has an 8 out of 10 probability of containing the words alien space monster

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
or spooky aliens or something like that.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
That sounds great.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Green Street, maybe a little bit more Sean Kirkpatrick work, I think would be excellent.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Absolutely.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Way to kick off the week.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Thank you, Django.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
My mom's dog's name is Django.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Nice to see you, new subscriber.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Thank you very much, man.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I really appreciate that.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
First video, when you get it, feel free to drop the link.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'd love to watch it.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
How about we get started with the, yes, Green Street does have DOD ties.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
He does.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh, Norway Oslo here, man.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I was just in Oslo last September.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
My girlfriend is Norwegian.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I loved it.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I can get the link.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes, please, brother.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Let's start with Steven Greer's event.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
This wasn't nearly as publicized as something like the 2023 National Press Club event.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm not exactly sure why.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
I know Greer put a lot of effort into kind of getting a lot of attention towards that.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
This was done in London.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
A bit strange as there were different tiers to kind of witness the event.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
The webinar itself was $50.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
It was really weird, but there was also a $75 in-person ticket to go see.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
She know if you're watching that, let me hear how it was.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
And then you could pay $1,500 for a meet and greet with Steven Greer.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Like a dinner because the way the event went from three to seven o'clock London time was

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Steven Greer's lecture and webinar, he says, and workshop.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
There was no workshop.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
There was no worksheets, but this was split into two distinct tabs as I'll kind of get to.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
After that, there was a dinner with Steven Greer and then a premiere of the lost century,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Steven Greer's newest documentary.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
I think that is free to stream on Peacock maybe or it's free to stream on some service.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
I recommend watching it.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
I know it features a lot of artwork by Michael Schrat and I really respect Michael Schrat

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
and love his work.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
And I still do think any of Greer's work is worth watching and then kind of analyzing

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and dissecting from there.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Let's get through these.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Do you think Steven Greer tries to bring forth any actual whistleblowers?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
In this event, no.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
He only talks about mostly whistleblowers.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
We know.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
In fact, Steven Greer had himself a viewing of a UFO witness list and decided to reiterate

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
some of that.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
But I think right now he's on the warpath of trying to kind of to identify these black

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
operation sites, two of which he mentioned in the video.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
And we'll go through those.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I'll pull up the exact actually three of them he mentioned in the video.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I got exact coordinates to all of them.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
So we'll kind of go through there and keep going.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Gluten, some swag would be legit.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I would like that.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I'd like to do some black stuff with some just stitched logos on there.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
It's free on rumble.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
It's free on rumble.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
So I recommend watching that.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I recommend watching unacknowledged.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Just anything by Greer is worth a watch.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
The production value on his documentaries are generally very high.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And it's still good to, yeah, cult leader.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
A lot of this conference was about CE five.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I remember.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
So for my discord, I had live notes in there just kind of telling everybody what was going

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
on with screenshots and stuff like that.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
And Greer would go on like 25 minute diatribes talking about like his near death experience

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
at 17 or a lucid dream of the future.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
And that's fine and dandy, but to spend, you know, a significant amount of time in a workshop

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
where people are paying money to go see.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm a little bit, uh, I'm a little bit, uh, not huge on that.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
So let's start.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm going to share my screen and we'll just kind of go through things a bit slowly as people

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
start to trickle in because there is some really interesting stuff Greer talked about

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and some interesting connections as well.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
So I need to remember how the heck to share my screen.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Cinema layout presents.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Share screen.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Tire screen.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay, cool.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So let's see what everybody's saying.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Um, Greer.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yes.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Exactly.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Greer should not be ignored, although he is controversial for anyone saying, please try

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
CE five.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Uh, you want to understand it?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I would like to understand it.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I still have not tried CE five.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Greer says he has, uh, tutorials on how to do such a thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
But, uh, you know, it's why not explore it and then kind of, uh, come up with a conclusion

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
there.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
But so some of the things Greer talked about in this was, uh, uh, talking about new top

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
secret witness testimony.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
He didn't really reference any new top secret testimony.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
We'll go through everybody he did talk about.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
You'll know some familiar players from my channel.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
He references Michael Herrera.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
He references TB, which I thought was in somewhat of strange taste.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
He went, uh, mentions MS.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Uh, witness, TE or ET.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I can't remember in which direction in the disclosure project archives.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It's 10, eight, nine, two.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
The guy who discussed a fake abductions and programmable life forms will kind of touch

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
into, uh, besides that, um, Greer posts two images of blacks.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I T visited from last year.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Neither of these images he posted are from his actual visit.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
One of them is from Google Earth.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
Another one is a ripoff of one of my images, which was kind of funny to see, uh,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
meetings between Dr. Greer and key members of Congress.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
We have a couple of notes on that.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So let's, um, let's start going through things.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
So I have, uh, power.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
I have screenshots of every single slide that Greer had.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm just going to get all these.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
We'll go one by one.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Sorry.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
What the heck?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
My bad guys.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Okay.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
So for, uh, Greer's first, he gave a little kind of preamble when he was talking about

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
serious disclosure and so forth.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
Greer states that his first CE five attempt occurred in 1992 in England at the height

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
of crop circles.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Greer claimed that his initial CE five event led to a crop circle that inspired his CE

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
five logo, which is this.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
So Greer stated that, um, he summoned a UAP craft, eat this crop circle with this design

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
appeared.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And then he saw a large saucer like design in a field.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
That was new to me.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
I know Greer kind of states that since he was like 18, he even said this in the, uh,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
presentation that he had kind of figured out how the universe works, which I find a

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
little bit egotistical.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm not going to lie.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Even if a CE five has some real practices to it, I don't think it's very humble to

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
state you understand how the universe works as a 17 year old man.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
But this is how kind of serious disclosure and so forth came to be.

12:17.000 --> 12:24.000
So his initial slide, some of the points he wanted to talk about were, um, he approached

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
this sort of webinar as kind of like a kindergarten level briefing for individuals.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
He kept saying in the first couple of slides that, you know, whoever watches this, it's

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
going to absolutely blow your mind.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Like you're going to be crying when you leave this year.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
You're not going to really be able to understand what you just saw.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
And to be honest, there wasn't too much like new information here.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
There's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss, but there wasn't a lot of really new, um,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
information.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
So something that Greer does state on these first couple of slides is when, when he was

12:56.000 --> 13:06.000
young, a gatekeeper to the program who tried to kind of not really buy Greer off, but to,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
um, but intimidated Greer.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
So Greer said that Major Albert Stubblebine was this individual.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
Stubblebine has mentioned multiple times in the witness list.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
So sorry, spell check.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
So Greer has a witness, 10, 5, 9, 9, who worked with Major Stubblebine for four years, has

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
documents, recording interviews and others to back up his claims.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I've found no, none of those documents in the DP archive.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
Uh, he also taught Greer has a witness, 10192 of an ex remote viewer under Stubblebine,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
um, and so forth.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
But here is a really interesting witness guys.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Uh, check this out.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
610658.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I noticed this a lot.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I noticed this a lot earlier when I was kind of reading through the DPR.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I cried the first time.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
So Greer has a witness 10658.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
He says that this witness has been involved in the sixties, former head of Fort Huachuca.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I hope I'm saying that right.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
And if I'm not, I'm sorry.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Fort Huachuca, army intelligence where ET craft and body are stored.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
He says this because later when Greer posts his facility list, he talks about Fort Huachuca

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
being a really kind of key facility.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Well guys, now here's what's interesting.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Okay.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
So major Albert Stubblebine Greer says this person intimidated him.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Let's go to look at the, um, let's look at the army intelligence center in school at

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
So this is the Fort Huachuca who was in charge of, sorry, let me back up for a second.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
When Greer talks about Fort Huachuca, which we'll address later in the video, he says

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
that the person he spoke to ran a Fort Huachuca and discussed ET craft and ET bodies in the

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
1970s.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Okay.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
So check this out.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Brigadier General Eugene Kelly Jr. took command of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center in school

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
This was in the year 1975.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
But this is rather interesting.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
In 1977 at Fort Huachuca, he relinquished his command to General Albert Stubblebine.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
So Stubblebine could very well be this witness right here, 10658, somebody who has been involved

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
with the 60s, former head of Fort Huachuca Army Intelligence where ET craft and bodies

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
are stored.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
When later in the video we'll talk about Greer referencing a source at Fort Huachuca who

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
worked there in the 70s to talk about ET craft and bodies.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
But this is also somewhat at odds with Greer's original statement that Stubble, Stubblebine

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
specifically tried to intimidate him.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
But I would have a high bet here that this is probably General Albert Stubblebine.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
So Greer states he was approached by insiders when he was a 30, when he was in his 30s.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
He labeled these guys as white hats or good guys or blue team as we'll discuss earlier.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
If you remember from the majestic video, kind of blue team, red team, these are often labeled

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
to be UFO craft retrieval operators.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
So don't get that confused as we talk about blue team guys.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
These are going to be guys that Greer states are black program insiders who are kind of

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
good guys who want the truth to come out.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
People Greer states were sent to him because top brass in the Pentagon weren't read into

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
the UFO situation.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
Greer makes a direct mention to briefing Admiral Thomas Wilson, which of course is now really

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
interesting with Eric Davis confirming the Wilson Davis notes.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
But he also talks about him briefing the CIA director in the early 90s.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
And I know this is a contentious point about Greer briefing the CIA director.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I believe he states he sat down and briefed the director.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
And I believe the counter argument to that is Greer just blasted out an email to the CIA

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
director who just kind of read it and threw it in the bin.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
So I'm not sure if that conversation has advanced very much.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Stubblebind died in 2017.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
He's no longer with us.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
So we can't be contacted here.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
And Greer says a lot of this kind of contact about good guys, white hats, blue team in the

17:04.000 --> 17:10.000
air who contacted him wanting to kind of restore oversight to black programs was under the Clinton

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
administration.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
So this for me is a new line of research to head down kind of what went on under the Clinton

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
administration.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
So let's go on to slide two.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Sorry.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Sorry.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Wrong window.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Let's go on to slide two.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
Here Greer talks about how if you guys remember the 2001 disclosure briefing document, I highly recommend it.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Let me pull it up.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
If you guys have never read this document, it is brilliant.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
It's it's Greer's best piece of work.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
And I will always stand by that.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
This is fantastic.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
But Greer states he was asked to make his disclosure briefing document in order to brief Senate intelligence and the

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
armed services staff.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
So this would have been in the early, mid to late nineties.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
Greer states he was contacted by the most senior person, a staff for Senate of the gang of eight.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
And this member of the gang of eight and his senior staff are kind of knocked on the doors internally in the

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Department of Defense and the Pentagon, but were denied.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
So Greer also states he was brought in a skiff, but didn't need clearance.

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
Because his DPR DPI archive had more actionable intelligence and information than the intelligence community on UAP.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
So that was pretty, that was pretty interesting to me.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Greer was then approached kind of earlier in the 2020s into a skiff.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
He said he brought the Trump presidential briefing document to a skiff.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
We know that Lou Elizondo and Ross Colt Hart have stated that Trump has brought in a skiff.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
Trump has been somewhat, if not fully briefed into the UAP situation.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I still haven't really researched that.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So I don't really have an opinion.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Greer likes to add in these little details to kind of add drama.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It's great showsmanship actually.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It kind of really engages the audience.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
He says in this specific meeting there was a bourbon bottle in the middle of the table.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Within 10 minutes, the intelligence guys were desperately reaching for the bottle.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
It's just a little bit of unnecessary fluff.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
Greer states he has been in skiffs multiple times, each with top secret, secret, compartmentalized intelligence.

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
Clearance folks who were all astonished at how long Stephen Greer has been doing this, pushing for disclosure.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
So Greer now kind of talks about this law enforcement update.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
And this is where things get really interesting guys.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
So if you're kind of halfway paying attention, I would lock in here because this is a little bit of new stuff from Greer.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Greer states he is in contact with top tactical operations people.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
These are Green Berets, SEALs, JSOC people who are all coming together behind closed doors to support Greer.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.000
All these commanders, these current tactical operations officers are seeking briefings from Greer.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
They have been asked by somebody, not sure because Greer doesn't devolved to bring black projects back under congressional oversight.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
So in summary, Greer's stating that a lot of JSOC leaders are being asked to bring the program back under control and moving with Greer.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
This is very interesting.

20:26.000 --> 20:39.000
Greer says, and I quote, that there are plans or possible plans to quote unquote, roll on dugway proving grounds, Area 51, Edwards Air Force Base and other black sites.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Roll on.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
He says, take them back.

20:42.000 --> 20:53.000
If taking these sites back involves any sort of force or a legal entry or brute force entry, does this not egregiously violate OPSEC?

20:53.000 --> 21:06.000
Because I think what Greer is referring to is by force taking back these sites that he says are under black project control because Greer also goes on to state that black program leaders dwarf Hitler and the Nazis,

21:06.000 --> 21:12.000
which, you know, that's always never a in great taste.

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
Yes, he has mentioned this before on kind of podcast before about forcibly enter entering these sites.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
But I don't think he's fully pieced everything together with kind of who he's talking to in order to do that.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
But I could absolutely be wrong.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
For the SAP whistleblower protection Greer has been talking about.

21:29.000 --> 21:40.000
Since June, 2024, Greer has been tasked and with others for providing OPSEC for whistleblowers, 762 of these according to Greer.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.000
These cover individual for all firsthand individuals according to Greer, people who are there when craft were shot down, reverse engineered, etc.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
The program is operational for US whistleblowers only with his show in.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
It could be wrong.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I very well could be wrong.

21:56.000 --> 22:04.000
We're talking about Greer's project today, his speech in London, his event there.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
There was a webinar.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
There was an in it kind of in person show I bought the pay per view.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
So we're talking about that.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Florian, thank you very much.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I really appreciate that.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Thank you very much.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
He might have talked about it on Sean Ryan.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
He might have.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I got to listen to that again.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
But yeah, Greer does suck at OPSEC something will continue to talk about today.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
So yeah, so this this program Greer States is for US whistleblowers only.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
He's trying to get something set up in the UK.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
He basically asks for funding and backing there.

22:38.000 --> 22:46.000
And this is a special access program to protect firsthand whistleblowers from presumably threats on their life.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Greer talks about deep cover defectors.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
And he addresses this in parallel to catastrophic disclosure.

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
He states there's a group currently with performing operations within black projects who are trapped within the system.

23:01.000 --> 23:12.000
Greer States is trying to work with these people to kind of, you know, bring these black operations back under congressional oversight or possibly roll on them if that needs be.

23:12.000 --> 23:20.000
Greer also goes on to talk about how after his viewing of a dumb entrance, which we'll talk about soon, he was almost killed.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
This is a gross exaggeration.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
He fell.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
He fell off his bike.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
So yeah.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
So sorry, let me let me get through a couple of comments here.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
Let's see Greer sucks at OPSEC got my PC admitting he I'd like to see that if you would like to post that.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
As well.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Lazar was used for soft disclosure.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Get the attention of Harry Reid.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
He was 23 and an eccentric.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Interesting.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Yes, I have that's that's also great.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I think that's kind of making the news rounds of late.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Very interesting.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
So Greer likes to state that 90% of what is known in ufology is disinformation.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
He states he has the 10% that is considered real information included in the 90%.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
This is a slide from the presentation is that we don't have man made UFOs.

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
This is a point kind of I have really sort of changed my position on in the past few months.

24:25.000 --> 24:34.000
The alien threat interdimensional phenomena, which is weird because Greer will later on in the second half of this presentation talk about internet interdimensional phenomena.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
ETs are demons, abductions, weapons in space.

24:38.000 --> 24:46.000
When the truth and we'll kind of get into this in the second half as well is really kind of new age woo stuff.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
If you if you guys know what that is about kind of raising consciousness, vibrations, stuff like that.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
See, peaceful CE5 contact enlightenment, universal peace.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
And I'm not saying there's nothing to that.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
I just think it's a I always think it's interesting when people claim to have all the answers when Greer says that 90% of what's known in ufology.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Is disinformation, but his 10% is the true information.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Greer talks about DPI archive.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
He says that it will take years for people to sift through all the information.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
That's just demonstrably untrue.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
We can sit through the info here.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Of course, we have 13 sections here.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
Greer says he has a 14th session here that he can't wait to talk about and post on the site.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So I'm really excited to see that.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Or thank you so much.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I really appreciate that.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Starbucks is extremely, extremely expensive.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Consciousness is the key to all of this.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I absolutely agree.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
There's there's much of kind of human cognition, human consciousness in terms of the UAP phenomena.

25:49.000 --> 25:57.000
I just find it a little bit strange when Greer says that his 10 he is the one who holds 10% of the true information.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
So Greer, and now is when we'll kind of go into a little bit of the discussion of some of the whistleblowers and witnesses he talks to.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
Something I took special note of, which I found kind of funny is Greer talks about the pages and pages, the 23 pages of redacted witnesses.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
But Greer says he likes to honor the whistleblowers request for confidentiality.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
Anybody who's seen any of my videos will know that's just his operational security is absolutely dreadful.

26:24.000 --> 26:32.000
So next we'll start talking about illegal operations, locations, corporations based on intel from his witnesses.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
You guys know the Greer facility list.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
If you don't let me pull that up facilities maps and list.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
So Greer has all of these facilities, including maps pointing towards them.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Sorry, that looks nice and reversed colors.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
All of these are garnered from the pages of witness testimony here.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
For example, you know, we can look at Dugway Proving Grounds as given by MS.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
We can go over here to a little place in Indiana where we might know a spot and so on.

27:07.000 --> 27:15.000
But and so Greer talks about now the first dumb entrance to which he was taken to.

27:15.000 --> 27:23.000
This is he states is the anthill in the eastern desert of California or western desert of Nevada.

27:23.000 --> 27:33.000
Let me pull up with this place is called because I actually found it and I need to.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Sorry guys just give me a second here.

27:35.000 --> 27:44.000
I need to find out exactly what this place is called again.

27:44.000 --> 27:52.000
So I can get you guys exact exact locations.

27:52.000 --> 28:00.000
Greer states this location that we're talking about is basically an entrance to a dumb or a deep underground military base.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
If you can go online, you can find this exact place.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Sorry guys.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
It's what's known as a volcanic cinder cone like volcano offshoots.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
Greer stating this is a dumb entrance and let me pull up the exact place.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Sorry.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I forgot what this place is is called.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Is it called the Salt Lake?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yes.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Okay.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Got it.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
If you want to find this place on Google Maps, this is called the Salt Lake Cinder Cone.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Okay.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
This is the exact entrance that Greer is stating is a dumb entrance right here the Salt Lake Cinder Cone.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I can get a nice zoom in.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
This, as I said, is a cinder cone.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
We can look by because these generally occur near volcanic activity.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
And I think there's a volcano located about 25 miles or so northeast of this location.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I'm not sure if these are other cinder cones.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm not a rock specialist, but this location right here.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
I don't understand where the entrance here is.

29:04.000 --> 29:12.000
If anything, this possibly could be dirt moved for underground locations, but I don't know where an entrance could be in this location.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Let me say a couple, thank you guys real fast.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
And we got the next location to talk about a little something to somewhere.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Thank you very much.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Tell us and thank you for the boost too.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I really appreciate that.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Maglevs connecting all the DUNS.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
Yes, we will talk about that too because Greer touches on it.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Sorry.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
My questions are, are you familiar with Northrop Ant Hill?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Greer calls this Northrop Ant Hill, I think.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
I'm actually, because he calls this the Ant Hill as a DUM.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
So he calls this, yeah, as we can see the Ant Hill.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Sorry.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Okay.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Crackerjack, thank you very much.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Greer stones.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
I turn over.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
Greer does awesome work and he, I still recommend checking out all of his documentaries and kind

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
of paying attention to what he says because it's very interesting.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
So you guys will probably know this site.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
Next, Greer talks about the Hellendale site, the Lockheed Martin Hellendale site.

30:14.000 --> 30:23.000
Now what's really interesting here guys is let's get back to the DPI archive.

30:24.000 --> 30:36.000
So if we go to UFO kind of secret related facilities, top priority documents and so forth with some photos of stuff.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
A Hellendale location, there used to be multiple images on here.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
So I'm not quite sure why Hellendale was taken off of the DPI archive.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
And I can also state for a fact that within the presentation today, Greer didn't mention Hellendale.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
So I don't know, I really don't understand what the play here was.

30:54.000 --> 31:02.000
I don't know who this is attempting to kind of confuse or fool, especially because people in my discord, as I post this live, there was a user.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
It's really smart guy.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
His name is rectified.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
He knew he said immediately, hey, this is Hellendale.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And I'm sure multiple people recognize it as well.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
So within the presentation, Greer stated that he didn't say the name Hellendale and the images of Hellendale have been stripped off the DPI archive.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
But he Greer states that this director of black operations took him to this Hellendale site.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
He says that this Hellendale plant is a staging ground for electro gravitic ARV or alien reproduction vehicle.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I'll be saying ARV the rest of the time.

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
The diamonds here on the runway Greer states are for using kind of scalar technologies.

31:41.000 --> 31:52.000
So scalar technologies to kind of test human made ARVs and their resilience to kind of EMP weaponry or to bring down ET craft.

31:52.000 --> 32:00.000
Greer states that I think one to two craft are brought down by this site in particular, maybe all sites a year.

32:00.000 --> 32:07.000
He also brings up an image of this site at the Hellendale plant says this is EMP weaponry.

32:07.000 --> 32:17.000
And that the EMPs are used in conjunction with scalar technology to knock out craft a year that this site has been operational for black program duties for upwards of 40 years.

32:19.000 --> 32:31.000
The person the black operations director who flew him over this Greer states in this presentation that this same individual has personally been present at ET craft shoot down and personally recovered craft and bodies.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
So real fast Florian, thank you so much.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I really appreciate the euros from Germany.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Have you seen above majestic I have.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
What is your take about alien human bases on the mood and Antarctica and space travel for decades now.

32:44.000 --> 32:56.000
There's a lot of really interesting kind of witnesses in the DPI archive specifically about UFO and NHI signatures on the moon and I would like to explore those further.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I don't think they're out of the realm of possibility.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
I just think that that specific topic needs a lot of a lot more hard nose research, a lot more hard nose research.

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
So next, as you guys know from the facilities list.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
Greer has a list of numerous, numerous, numerous, numerous facilities.

33:16.000 --> 33:24.000
Most if not all of these guys have been referenced in the DPI archive.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Sorry, I'm the 2001 disclosure briefing document.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
See here, China Lake.

33:30.000 --> 33:36.000
I'm in that place.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
So I don't think much has changed on this facility list.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Greer also talked about this in a 2016 speech.

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
I have referenced quite a bit, including my work on Doug way.

33:48.000 --> 34:04.000
I mean, this is I haven't fully taken a look yet, but this is just copied verbatim since 2001 or I think 1996 is when this specific place was or this specific list was compiled for the DPI archive.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So we'll keep going.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Sorry, I'm just kind of trying to organize my notes.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
A lot of the times my notes are sloppy are pretty sloppy.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Continuing on with the sites.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, Greer made specific reference here.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
Very specific reference here is about the Los Alamos National Labs.

34:26.000 --> 34:36.000
I know you guys have probably all heard of Los Alamos National Labs, but he talks about a maglev system under Los Alamos connecting it to other dumb locations.

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
He states, I don't know how he got this intel, but he states that Los Alamos has direct access to Kirtland AFB and Dulce.

34:44.000 --> 34:54.000
I can never, you guys know, I don't know how to speak, but Greer likes to kind of claim here that any above ground duties about the Dulce base are completely false.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And this is just one large below ground dumb.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
There's a lot of interesting work on this.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
I can't remember exactly what the pieces right now that I've talked before UFO highway.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
It might be called, which is a good PDF that talks about the Dulce location.

35:06.000 --> 35:18.000
Greer says that this Dulce place is where it contains biotech labs where fake ETS, aka PLF programmable life forms are made.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
Interesting to me as well Greer state specifically that some of these dumps were built in the 1980s.

35:25.000 --> 35:33.000
At least in my research, I feel like I've seen plenty of discussion that dumps have come come around a little bit before that.

35:33.000 --> 35:41.000
But I do want to bring something up about, sorry, I do want to bring something up about in the DPR archive.

35:41.000 --> 35:53.000
I seem to have ex exed out of that tab, but Greer has some patents for a huge boring underground boring machine that he states was used for kind of building these maglev systems.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
Creating the deep underground military bases.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Yes, it is.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
This is Jack Ramanson's gym.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I love repping this gym.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Awesome gym.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Okay, look, keep going here.

36:05.000 --> 36:13.000
And now at this time because Greer has multiple pages he talks about in terms of underground bases that we already have listed on that primary site.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Sorry, trying to pull this up.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
He again talks about Fort Hachuca.

36:17.000 --> 36:32.000
And again, I will reference that I believe that the witness 10658 in the DPR archive is really major Albert Stubblebine, which conflicts of Stephen Greer's earlier claims that Stubblebine tried to intimidate and create fear within Stephen Greer.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
Interesting reference here about Pine Gap underground facility in Australia.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
He says this is a transnational majestic location.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Doesn't say majestic 12 just as majestic.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Now, I do know of an intelligence guy.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
He's a friend of mine who says he has been to Pine Gap and didn't see anything there doesn't think anything could be there.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
But then again, I don't think he was given access to the entire facility.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Mention of Doug way proving grounds outside here will go.

36:59.000 --> 37:12.000
Okay, so when I interviewed MS, I think I gave very vague directions to the entrance that he claimed was for the Doug way dumb.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
I just said it was near German village in Utah.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Greer gives.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
In fact, he gets my pin for this place.

37:19.000 --> 37:29.000
So I can give you guys that exact location to and because Greer has kind of violated this upset here.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Greer talks about UFO related facilities and companies here.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
I don't think anything really new is going to stand out here.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
He adds kind of in the he has talked about this in his 2016 briefing.

37:42.000 --> 37:50.000
I think this is what he added that SAIC is a crown jewel here because in the same presentation he mentions.

37:50.000 --> 38:05.000
Sorry, he also mentions I talked about her in my NSWC video with RA about the testimony of Denise McKenzie, a former SAIC employee who would talk about

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
being large contracts with nothing actually on the books.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
So next we move on to a witness.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
I actually hadn't seen and this can be pretty interesting.

38:17.000 --> 38:30.000
So Greer talks about project mannequin in 1997, a top secret underground based genetic engineering PLFs, please in P'smore UK under witness BK.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
And you guys know that I will give you the exact witness name.

38:33.000 --> 38:42.000
Well, this isn't one, but this is somebody connected to this witness BK witness 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Again, that's 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
And here's the witness 10 412.

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
This is the witness that Greer is stating has information on PLFs and an underground dumb in the UK.

38:57.000 --> 39:09.000
So project mannequin at RAF P'smore has seen and touched gray beans bred in NSA underground base evidence of military committing abductions globally.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
So in the DPI archive.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
10 412.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
We won't go through all these documents right now.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
But under 10 412 this individual BK.

39:23.000 --> 39:36.000
There's quite a bit of interesting documents to research, including some alleged actual documents smuggled out of this project mannequin, which is presumably to make PLFs.

39:36.000 --> 39:49.000
According to this individual, there are also sketches from this individual BK about the creation of PLFs, the manufacturing of like a classic gray and so forth.

39:50.000 --> 40:00.000
And that this project mannequin is also in charge of making what we would think of as the classic reptilian design along with the grays.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
I think project came a lot interviewed the piece more winners. I haven't seen that I'll absolutely have to check that out.

40:05.000 --> 40:12.000
So, and now this will be one that kind of me close some of these tabs guys. Sorry.

40:12.000 --> 40:19.000
Let me close some of these tabs. Greer then gets into the infamous TV.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
So, out of respect.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
I am not going to talk about who TV might be or his name.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
I understand that's definitely out there.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
And people know about this individual or might know, but so I'm not going to bring that up, but there's plenty about there.

40:38.000 --> 40:54.000
So, initially, this Lawton, Oklahoma case with TV, this is in reference to some statements by TV to Stephen Greer in which some technology was leveraged from this crash that was used at Fort Sill, Oklahoma base in 2003,

40:54.000 --> 41:03.000
where General John M. Riggs showed off classified cloaking technology to a BAE systems employee, where he was then unceremoniously retired.

41:03.000 --> 41:15.000
Now, the kernels of truth in this statement are that General John M. Riggs was in fact demoted a star upon his retirement and sent basically to the basement of the Pentagon and handed in his clothes and said,

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
you're gone. So, he was very unceremoniously retired and according to I think it's a Baltimore Sun article. This was for improper use of contractors.

41:23.000 --> 41:34.000
So, I think I have these in my video with TV, but Greer just kind of posts some images of kind of the crash retrieval that occurred in Lawton according to TV.

41:34.000 --> 41:42.000
He also posts this ARV looks very, I don't think this is actually in reference to an ARV according to Greer, but posts a craft in an underground facility.

41:42.000 --> 41:56.000
What we would probably know as Mark McCandless is Fluxliner ARV. Fluxliner, if you know that name, Greer also at the end of the project says that the Fluxliner name was actually used for Lockheed's first generation of ARV craft.

41:56.000 --> 42:08.000
I didn't know this because this wasn't provided in the notes with TV, but apparently this location right here is an underground base actually in Oklahoma near Fort Sill.

42:08.000 --> 42:22.000
So, that might be a location to look at Fort Sill, the Lawton area for any sort of bases down there. Greer also states that some craft shot down break into pieces while others have sort of a controlled landing due to being stunned.

42:22.000 --> 42:38.000
This has more relevance to the infographics whistleblower when he's talking about eggs and bells, bells being the most commonly crashed craft and that the vast majority of the time they almost disintegrate break into pieces or basically melt away like nothing is there.

42:38.000 --> 42:52.000
So, that's an interesting connection there. Greer dropped some specific terminology when he was talking about this location when we get a sip of cold brew.

42:52.000 --> 43:08.000
He states that retrieved NHI living bodies are not referred to as extraterrestrials. They are kind of referred to as evens, extraterrestrial biological entities as you know but with an N on the end.

43:08.000 --> 43:16.000
But these individuals that are taken alive are called captives or refugees and those are the exact words but used by Greer.

43:16.000 --> 43:32.000
Next on to Mr. MS, we know him very well. So, at this point covering a TB and MS back to back we got a little UFOs witness list action going on which you know I always like to see.

43:32.000 --> 43:40.000
Greer talks a little bit more and gives a little bit more insight apparently because apparently he has some more connections and things to study about the craft that MS saw.

43:40.000 --> 43:48.000
If you guys remember from that video MS stated to have seen like a basically inverted cone triangle section at the bottom of the craft.

43:49.000 --> 43:57.000
New drawing here from Greer's archives. I wonder if this is a shrap drawing if it is that's great Michael Schratz the best.

43:57.000 --> 44:06.000
But Greer states to have some insight on this on the pyramid we talked about which we kind of I don't really remember if I hypothesized about it.

44:06.000 --> 44:17.000
But Greer stated that he kind of knew factually that this inverted pyramid is an EMP crystalline structure that causes objects to basically travel instantaneously.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
It likens the abilities of this piece to like a astral projection functionality.

44:24.000 --> 44:41.000
This is a good question why are all these people talking to Greer instead of Congress could they be doing the latter in secret they absolutely could remember we talked about TB and his witnesses in his messages to Greer here was summoned to testify before members of the gang of eight including Marco Rubio in 2022.

44:42.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah whistleblower protection is terrible remember guys the witness or whistleblower protection doesn't cover pensions so that was something that Greer had stated kind of in media about specifically TB that he was afraid for both his life and his pension.

44:56.000 --> 45:03.000
So even with these whistleblower acts your pension is not covered and love these guys with families and stuff this is presumably what they're worried about.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
Okay MS Dugway render we know this from the video.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
We know this from the video group post some images.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
These look these look a little familiar to me.

45:16.000 --> 45:25.000
But so let's go to the exact entrance.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
German village in am I going to Utah I don't know if I'm going to Utah.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Well before I get to that.

45:32.000 --> 45:51.000
Group post an untitled place mark changing the colors of a plate of a mark that could only be me but so the Greer posted this on the DPI archive okay I'm just going to show that once again in his recent updates.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
It was in.

45:54.000 --> 46:02.000
Wow, I guess he just took that off really recently.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Okay.

46:05.000 --> 46:19.000
Last time I checked this in the critical updates Greer had posted image for the anthill and the Dugway site in Greer's presentation he posts this image for the Dugway location.

46:19.000 --> 46:27.000
And let me try and find it.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Dugway German village.

46:30.000 --> 46:38.000
I got to remember my exact location now here guys.

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
Let me think.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
Let me I got to think about the exact coordinates here.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
Oh man this might be tough a little bit south of Dugway German village.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
We might be we're on the money.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
This is the location he provided.

47:02.000 --> 47:16.000
This is allegedly the entrance to the dumb right here according to what Greer posted in his September 8 2024 London press conference right.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Just a bit northwest of Dugway German village.

47:19.000 --> 47:28.000
So I was a little interested to see him post that, but especially if he is talking about taking back such sites.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I found that a little interesting.

47:30.000 --> 47:38.000
But now we can talk a little bit about a witness we talked about a little bit last week in the Greer archive about programmable life forms and so forth.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
This is witness TE.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
If you want to follow along in the DPI archive you can search witness 10892.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
Again that's 10892 and find relevant documents.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
German village. Where is German village.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Just search Dugway German village.

47:56.000 --> 48:03.000
Right here.

48:03.000 --> 48:10.000
Dugway German village. Just a little bit northwest of this location.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
So, yeah, it talks about TE. This is a witness we talked a little bit about last week.

48:16.000 --> 48:25.000
And the story of TE is this individual approach Greer claimed to be on a specialized ARV retrieval team.

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
Some artwork included here. I think this might be Rudy Garcia and some of Greer's team this artwork is really cool.

48:32.000 --> 48:41.000
This kind of triangle site is man made craft as you can see by the no step.

48:41.000 --> 48:49.000
This must be work by Michael Schrat, but it's a kind of a CAD drawing of this same device, the same craft.

48:49.000 --> 48:59.000
And eventually at some point this witness TE 10892 graduated from kind of ARV retrieval and was promoted to ET retrieval.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
So this event occurred and I can't remember what year this was. I know it's listed in the archive.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
This might have been 2004.

49:07.000 --> 49:15.000
Early 2000s where a sunflower type craft what crashed near or not crashed I'm sorry landed near Nellis.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
As you can see Greer also make specific mention to this ARV that was privy to this retrieval operation.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
If you can see here there's some soldiers lying in wait.

49:25.000 --> 49:36.000
This witness TE stated that as individuals approach this craft basically autonomy was taken away from all the soldiers and they were sent into basically like a stunned state.

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
Out of this what you would see as a fruit roll up craft came some ETS that looked like this.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
And this is must be a Rudy Garcia drawing excellent drawing.

49:46.000 --> 50:02.000
And so forth this witness TE was really disturbed by this exact operation because he found these ETS and they're kind of emerald blue eyes is so peaceful and kind of pure that he thought what the retrieval teams and shooting down craft were doing was sick.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
So he tried to basically defect and leave the retrieval force.

50:06.000 --> 50:14.000
Greer states that this individuals uncle who grandfathered him into the program was the only one who stopped this individual from being killed.

50:14.000 --> 50:27.000
Upon his release TE was targeted with a fake abduction where he was approached by these creatures and basically took brute force to them and found circuitry and so forth within.

50:27.000 --> 50:39.000
So next we'll go to the next witness talked about some of you guys might know this person some of you might not I have actually been trying to get in contact with Shannon Lee for a while.

50:39.000 --> 50:59.000
Shannon Lee is a witness who claimed to I can't 2008 2009 off the coast of I think it was Guam while in the Navy or the Coast Guard participated in a saucer retrieval from the ocean where a craft was almost tangled in the Japanese fisherman's net.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
And this was in conjunction with the US Marines.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
So again I've been trying to contact this guy for months.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Here's the image of the retrieval operation.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
He actually did an interview with Steven Greer.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I can't remember if it's on the DPI archive or not.

51:13.000 --> 51:22.000
I'll actually try to find it and post it but the actual video was taken off of Greer's was taken off of Greer's YouTube page.

51:22.000 --> 51:30.000
And I think this was maybe because I think Mr Lee suffered maybe from some social anxiety or something because the interview was just a little bit awkward.

51:30.000 --> 51:43.000
It was just a little disconjointed and stuff but I've always found this interview extremely interesting because according to Lee this craft was so heavy it almost toppled the Navy craft as it was lifted up in its net.

51:43.000 --> 51:59.000
Greer stated and Shannon Lee states that this artwork right here is a little bit off the craft was had no seams kind of no pathways just a really solid seamless craft and he tried to take a sharp object to it and to no effect.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
To no effect.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
So upon returning Shannon Lee was forced to sign numerous NDAs and so forth.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
And you guys might know this individual from the disclosure from the National Press Club conference.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
He was very sickly.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
He looked it looked really.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
I don't know if it was from his encounter or from just health.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
I think he mentioned he had a brain injury but Steven Digna.

52:24.000 --> 52:34.000
In his testimony before kind of an abduction case he talks about being on a bombing range where he was with two Raytheon employees where they saw a large boomerang shaped craft.

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
And I believe one if not both of these craft yes Greer talked about this was a projection.

52:40.000 --> 52:57.000
And here is a little bit where Greer dove into kind of the project blue beam kind of fear mongering stuff he talks about these projection techniques you know if you see a craft over London they can produce numerous craft and kind of fake an invasion and so forth.

52:57.000 --> 53:07.000
But this was apparently a Raytheon craft that had entered into the bombing range for clandestine purposes I don't know for whatever purposes it seems strange to do that over an active bombing range and yes.

53:07.000 --> 53:15.000
Steven Digna was suffering a brain injury I wish him peace he looked like he was suffering quite a bit from there.

53:15.000 --> 53:25.000
So Greer stated here as well that anti gravity technology in which this Raytheon craft was based off of was mastered in October of 1954.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Sorry.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Next of course.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Greer talks briefly about Michael.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
We all know Michael from this channel.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
He shows the video made by Star Labs of the octagonal craft.

53:39.000 --> 53:48.000
We've all seen these so I'm not going to waste space or so forth but Greer had one new detail about Michael story that I wasn't aware of.

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
And I'll certainly bring it up to Michael Greer thinks this craft was Lockheed skunk works or EG and G.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
Why I don't know exactly why he thinks that.

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
But that is what Greer states here he doesn't expand on that anymore he just kind of moves on.

54:03.000 --> 54:12.000
Greer states the initial misconceptions of him and thinking this was kind of drug smuggling operations of course I've talked about Michael initially thought when he saw this was drugs.

54:12.000 --> 54:18.000
Greer kind of assumed also Greer has talked to witnesses who state that ARVs are used for smuggling drugs.

54:18.000 --> 54:25.000
One of these witnesses I think his files were removed from the DPI archive I think it was witnessed.

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
Sorry let me I'll look this up.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Let me see if I got it right.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Yes, 10329 right here in the DPI archive.

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
I think his files were taken down, but witness 10329 right here.

54:43.000 --> 54:51.000
Worked in deep black projects as knowledge of advanced crafting connections to drug running knows of two sites near Nashville Tennessee where craft have been seen landing.

54:51.000 --> 54:59.000
Same locations were used by the CIA slash 160 if that's an Air Force division locations are private airship and another in a valley between mountains.

54:59.000 --> 55:07.000
So I've talked a little bit to this person I will talk to them again and you know if there's some interesting stories to make.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
I will absolutely make them real quick scallions.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
I love you.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Thank you so much for your support.

55:13.000 --> 55:18.000
I really really really appreciate it really appreciate it.

55:18.000 --> 55:28.000
Yeah, here kind of with most of these stories guys Greer will talk about the witness will talk about what's going on and then kind of round it back to himself like.

55:28.000 --> 55:37.000
Greer was talking about Michael and then states that after the 2023 NPC that his YouTube was hacked and demonetized and.

55:37.000 --> 55:57.000
That just wasn't a necessary addition to me but Greer then talks what I talked about in my interview with Michael that the insider who spoke to Michael was at the NPC 2023 and exact quote from Greer that this insider said to him quote.

55:57.000 --> 56:09.000
That is worse than your Marine guy thinks it is end quote you guys know I like those quote end quote this individual the insider that Michael has spoken to claim to have been part of this operation.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
And then.

56:12.000 --> 56:26.000
As you'll know this from Michael's testimony Greer starts talking about P3 psionic predisposed I can't remember exactly what pre P3 stands for at the moment my brain is going a mile per minute, but he talks about kind of P3 assets a little bit and if you guys.

56:27.000 --> 56:34.000
Remember this from Michael story and then Ross cult her Ross Colt heart talking about consciousness and so forth.

56:34.000 --> 56:49.000
But these individuals are basically used to interact with with ET craft recovered craft, or I think in some cases as Greer likes to stay kind of lower craft in.

56:49.000 --> 56:59.000
Consciousness technology and P3 operator technology hijacking of ET craft target and bring them down or take control of them.

56:59.000 --> 57:06.000
Greer states that this is a theme. This is a this was a very strange slide to me guys.

57:06.000 --> 57:16.000
I found it strange that Greer brought in hand dominance and preference and individuals into accountability for psy abilities.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I wasn't.

57:18.000 --> 57:25.000
I certainly have never heard that anywhere and I have not heard that I probably won't hear that again.

57:25.000 --> 57:35.000
But Greer states that most of these P3 assets these people who are tasked with in kind of interacting with ET craft with their consciousness connection most die.

57:35.000 --> 57:45.000
Those who cannot do the work are used as forced laborers and maintenance in side the facilities and some are now defecting to disclosure project.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
I would like to hear a little bit more about that.

57:48.000 --> 57:57.000
And at this time, Greer mentioned a base in the Chihuahua Desert used to house P3s.

57:57.000 --> 58:10.000
This is a reference to the sentinels of ethers kind of dops or play written by Michael or ghost written by Michael's insider that he's contacted, which talks about we talked about this all last week 2004.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
What we can now assume is a Lockheed Martin recovery team wiping out a JSOC team.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
The differences in sentinels of ether involves trafficking P3 assets in John Stewart source.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
It involves tracking it down to craft.

58:23.000 --> 58:36.000
So then Greer went for quite a while on a story about a dream he had when he was around 18 and knew the structures of the cosmos.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
This was about this was a while kind of leading after discussing Michael and P3s.

58:42.000 --> 58:57.000
And this, of course, Greer reiterates that at some unknown time he was approached and offered $2 billion to kind of hush up in defect, not really defect, not really joined black programs, but to stop talking and stop working on the DPA archive.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
I think he's discussed this quite a little bit.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
Of course, at this time, this is obviously very powerful for Greer.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
He got pretty emotional at this time.

59:05.000 --> 59:13.000
And I can understand that, especially working on such such kind of huge stuff in his life, you spent so much time doing this.

59:13.000 --> 59:22.000
But, you know, I can sometimes I have trouble separating, you know, maybe some of this stuff is sympathy plays for Greer when he talks about himself so much, kind of getting emotional about that.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
But who knows who knows.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
So at this point we had an intermission, I think it was about 30 minutes.

59:28.000 --> 59:37.000
And when we come back from the break, most things were focused on kind of consciousness and so forth.

59:37.000 --> 59:52.000
So Greer kind of breaks down what he states is the UFO phenomenon it's broke down between ET interdimensional beings and classified black programs usaps and basically human reverse engineer technology.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I'll leave this up for a couple seconds.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But Greer likes to distinguish the fact or distinguish between ET craft and the DPI archive.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The guy has poured his entire life into this.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Greer has put decades, decades, decades.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Stubblebind was the one who offered him $2 billion.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Has he said that before?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I might just be messing out actually.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
That's interesting.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
For some reason it doesn't.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Is there a link that's not working?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Tell us that.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
If there's a link that's not working.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I thought this was a really interesting here guys.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Look under the classified unacknowledged special access programs you'll see holographic man made beings from thought forms.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Now if you guys know anything about like old, I can't even think to where this practice begins, but topos like a thought forms that manifest conscious beings.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I'm just, that's a lot.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That's a huge thing to put into a PowerPoint without really expanding on it further, especially saying that Lockheed skunk works essentially manifest topos.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So, yeah, so, yeah, so Greer talks about that both the extraterrestrial and ultra dimensional hypothesis of non human intelligence is through that both of these exist on our planet.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
They're just differentiated.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Most of what we can see as physical craft are in fact ET or ARV alien reproduction vehicles human made and Greer states that the vast majority of sightings of UFO, especially in today's age are actually ARV technology human made technology and not not real kind of ET craft.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:50.000
A lot of the ultra terrestrial stuff is kind of what you hear a little bit more about attached with woo in the phenomena, kind of floating orbs the poltergeist phenomena and so forth.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:06.000
A lot of this talk kind of dove into a little bit more of the kind of woo stuff discussing a lot of physics talk with quantum thrown in here and there to kind of make things sound a little bit more mysterious.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
We referenced the show stranger things as a description of summoning ultra terrestrial beings.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:26.000
This reminds me very closely of Alex Jones claims of of of of individuals high up in clandestine government operations who will take a bunch of DMT and then go talk to spirit programs.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Next, Greer, sorry.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And this time, Greer kind of discuss started to really get into kind of the consciousness aspect of of UAP, a lot of talk about kind of new age concepts like light beings and stuff.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Some of the interesting stuff that Greer discusses is that human programs and abilities are now very close and comparable to what ET technology has.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And this is very interesting to me.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Especially when you think about kind of analyze witness testimony of human made ARVs the possibility they work on electrogroupics like the TR3B and so forth.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I, it's really interesting to think about if human capabilities are near ET and the implications of that are that would mean that human these black programs have unrestricted use of basically surrounding basically unrestricted use of our solar system and other space

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
time, what kind of operations are they getting up to and so forth is a very interesting question.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And that Greer likes to state that humans are now an existential threat to ET.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Part of this is because Greer states the technologies ET extraterrestrials use are non local.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:48.000
A lot of these technologies require a craft being or technology to basically remove itself from 3D space time entered folds between dimensional space and pop up elsewhere.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah, the the holographic consciousness universe.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
This stuff at least I know this interests a lot of people.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That's why of course I'll put it up here.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It's not as big as my focus.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You guys know it's reverse engineering and crash retrieval.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So I might be a little not as knowledgeable on this topic here.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So if I sound ignorant or I'm just kind of skipping through stuff that you find really interesting.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That's my bad.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm just not as well versed on on such topics quickly Greer really kind of leaned into remote view.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Sorry, wrong tab.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Greer really leaned into remote viewing at this point and went on for a couple minutes about how he himself can levitate.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That was that I think is a bit a bit.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That's a bit of a stretch for me in terms of saying you can levitate and so forth.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I don't really see how that fits into this discussion even when speaking about consciousness and so forth.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:01.000
But we'll keep going because I want to get to Greer had Greer posted what he thinks of as his own Kardashev scale guys.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So you guys know the Kardashev scale.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It's a ranking of basically civilizations throughout the cosmos.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Humanity is what's known as like a level like 0.7 on the Kardashev scale.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
A level one Kardashev scale is able to harness the entire energy output of its host planet.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
A type two Kardashev scale is able to harness the total energy output of its host son.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And a level three Kardashev civilization is able to harness the entire energy output of its home galaxy.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
There are kind of more expansions on on this and different breakdowns.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
But Greer states that current human civilization is consumed by war.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's very primitive environmental technologies and it's plagued by extinction level events.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
A global peaceful civilization.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And I think this is Greer's ultimate goal to leave us lead us towards especially when you look at the lost century.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:56.000
His next video in which he really push is for kind of the the utilization of zero point energy and technologies that have been obfuscated.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And hidden with E.T. reverse engineering.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I'm just laughing at Mr. Mosilli's comments were zero.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Yeah, that's funny to me.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And a permanent P.I. I think this is a great point by Kai Greer magically assumes that humans are going to magically start loving each other.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And if we know NHI and advanced technology is real, yes, I disagree.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I think he I think a lot of that is he.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Arrest that on claims of like Ronald Reagan and his speech where he says I can't think of how fast humanity would come together if we face like an alien threat and so forth.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I agree.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I don't think that can be utilized to solely bring humanity together.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But a permanent P civilization develops trans dimensional technologies when you read that trans dimensional technologies just know that that's what I discussed when Greer says that a lot of these E.T. technologies are non local that they require the

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Utilizer of the technology to basically leave our current space time travel through dimensional folds reengaged another point of space time.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
The pursuit of science and consciousness.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Okay, we can go to but the the weird thing about this guys is Greer only posted to two of four of these slides.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Greer says there's four levels of civilization.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
He only posted two slides.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You can see two of four here.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
He only posted the slide before in this one.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So that was pretty funny to me the level three and interstellar civilization clear to travel to other star systems.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
However, if humans have ability similar to E.T. now, could we not feasibly travel to other star systems as well.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Development of widespread establishment of science of consciousness pursuit of higher states of consciousness early integration into other interstellar civilizations.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I do think the pursuit of consciousness needs to be integrated into a kind of us a level zero current current human civilization as well.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I think consciousness study is a is integral to the human experience, especially how it relates to UAP technology.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
That is not something that should be overlooked.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
It's still a concept that I'm can be quite unfamiliar with and quite uncomfortable with sometimes.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It's still really new to me concepts like P3 concepts like remote viewing consciousness studies still very new to that subject.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000
So if I'm ever ignorant towards it, that's why I'm still learning a level four cosmic consciousness civilization above 1% of something.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Senior ambassadors are enlightened in cosmic consciousness contact with other advanced civilizations.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
However, wouldn't a level three interstellar civilization be able to do the same?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:32.000
But according to this same log, if a cosmic consciousness civilization can provide guidance to emerging civilizations, would a level zero civilization such as humanity not be a emerging civilization?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Or would we need to be a level one or two a global peaceful civilization global peaceful civilization to receive contact and level five part of the senior interstellar collective.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
My question to Greer is where is he getting this information?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
What is he basing this off of?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I would I would really like to know because it's really interesting to me of enlightenment widespread and accelerated experience or innate.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I don't know what that word means.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I'm sorry guys technology parallel states of consciousness.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So Greer talks about some CE five stuff now.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And he posted a lot of images.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Most were just kind of vague shapes, not much to him.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
He posted two images.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Sorry wrong.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
He posted two images where actual forms can be seen from CE five contact.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I took a special note of right here, but I need to shout out a dude in my discord right when I posted this.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
The same gentleman rectified he posted.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Let me pull this up.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:51.000
This image right here on the right rectified posted that this was actually a sighting in Twitter in in Chile, sitting on Twitter in Chile.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And as far as rectified knows, Greer is not associated with this sighting at all.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
So why why post this if it's not yours, man?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Most of Greer's photos you can see a lot of CE five stuff on the DPI archive.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The vast majority of them are lights in the sky.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'm totally not.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I'm not totally closed off to CE five.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I just haven't seen evidence for it, you know, especially when it comes to the images.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It's just sort of really vague light forms.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So of course, there's there's not much I can kind of study off of that.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But I'd like to see more.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So interesting to me, I'm sure you guys have all heard of a lot of the stuff that Jason Sands has been talking about that.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:48.000
John Ramirez talked about that Lou has talked about that that Jeremy Corbell and George not kind of like to dangle in front of you a date, a deadline, right?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
When I say that most people probably think of 2027 as a sort of deadline.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I think it's associated with Jason Sands.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000
He overheard he states he overheard communications between NHI and humans or NHI and NHI saying they want their stuff back.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Greer made specific mention of the timeframe 2025 to 2030.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Quote, if we haven't corrected this problem, it will be corrected for us.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Greer states this is the worst case scenario that our mastery of ET technologies are a threat due to the fact these are non local technologies are harnessing and misuse of these technologies are affecting other solar systems.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And fixing this thing for us would be a correction to protect other worlds, life on earth and life elsewhere.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And that statement is kind of where Greer left the event.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Of course, then there was an ovation and everybody clapped and left.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So that was the that was the entire Greer catalog of his show today in London.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And now that that's over, we can go through kind of if you have questions about the event questions about anything, let's go through them.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
We'll talk about the whole thing.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000
If there's anything that stood out to you, we'll go through one by one and you guys know how I do.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
If there's any question, I will absolutely answer it.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So we'll start going through those.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Whoa, this is really over lit.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
How about that?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
It's really over lit.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Sorry about that, guys.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I don't know if that's better.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
So let's see.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I'm going to leave it on.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
The main issue with Greer is he does not distinguish between what he knows due to evidence and what he is speculating on.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
He's pretty much in his own category among UAP sources.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Yeah, I think it's crucial to for people when they're speculating to make sure that it's clear that they're speculating.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I think this is what got like Jason Sands and a bit of trouble out the gate because he would just kind of ramble on about scenarios and ideas

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and wouldn't really kind of nail down and specify when he's saying, hey, I'm speculating.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I don't know this for sure.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I think with a lot of these witnesses in Greer's archive, I'm not sure to the extent to which he has vetted every single one of these sources.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:11.000
So when he claims he has 762 whistleblowers, this is pretty much every name redacted or unredacted on the log.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
A lot of these names that he states are under whistleblower protection.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
A lot of these are labeled as like UFO researchers.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
For example, you guys know I'm working on the Kexpert case.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Stan Gordon is listed in there as a UFO researcher in point of contact to Kexpert witnesses.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Does he need to be offered?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
If you guys don't know Stan Gordon, he was the primary Kexpert researcher.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Did he need to be offered whistleblower protection?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:43.000
There's also a lot of the I feel like with the witness list and the facilities map.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Greer was happy to beef up the content over quality of the content, right?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I bet you can see what I'm saying.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000
For each email he received, somebody making claims, it's easy to redact the email, redact the name, throw it on the DPI archive to say, hey, here's another witness.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Look what they're saying now and so forth.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Hey, Flying Lotus, what's up dude?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Flying Lotus, if you guys don't know his music, Flying Lotus is awesome.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I recommend checking out the Black Balloon reprise with Denzel Curry and Never Catch Me with Kendrick Lamar.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Flying Lotus is great.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
What do I think about Richard Doty?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I don't think he can be trusted.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I think anything that Doty kind of connects his name to, it's almost impossible to get to the bottom of.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:36.000
All you have to do is look at Tobinowitz and his claims in a career's documentary Unacknowledged where he talks about the, I think it's the Roswell, yeah, the Roswell incident being some Russian dwarves,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
disfigured Russian dwarves and so forth.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000
So I tend to stay away from Doty as much as I possibly can.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
What are your thoughts on Sans?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Truthfully, I don't buy it at all, but would like to get your thoughts.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I'm remaining agnostic to Sans until I get a chance to kind of speak to him direct.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I know a lot of people, not a lot, I'd say I know about six people in the intelligence community and all of them, while they can't verify Sans' claims,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
they all speak very highly of him as an individual.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So I find that interesting.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Now, all these people that speak highly of him as an individual agree that the method in which he came forward was awful.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
You know, on Twitter spaces and to just engage with a lot of the Twitter drama and so forth.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And I've heard that that's just kind of the type of guy Sans is.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
He just wants to get that information out there.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
He's got a great and kind heart.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
He knows him directly, speaks incredibly highly of him.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
So if I get a chance to speak to him, I'd like to.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Until then, I'll probably just remain a little agnostic towards his case.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I do not trust Greer.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
He's a shifty.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I'll say it just like I've said a thousand times.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Greer has brought forth so much great witnesses and documents and stuff to study.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And then disclosure briefing document from 2001.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I will swear by it is the best piece of literature.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
If one of the best pieces of literature on the UFO subject.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Now, I agree with what Kai said earlier that Greer tries to make himself the center of everything.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
This was further enforced by Greer talking just inserting himself into everything.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I forgot when he was talking about Michael.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:20.000
He was saying that how he like worked out with Michael and how big Michael was and how much it made him soar to work out with Michael.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And it's, you know, it's, you know, why do you need to keep talking about yourself with all of that?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He likes to make himself the centerpiece of everything, but he has done great, great work.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Thanks for the shout out.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I'm just following your leads and focusing on the approval.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:48.000
There's just there's a ton of fluff and euphology and I know myself I have gotten caught going down some rabbit holes that lead nowhere and done some dead end work or work that I later found out is kind of just not much to it.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But just kind of focus on what you can.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I like how this channel attracts both people capable and willing to actually think and share lunatics.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I don't, I don't know.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I think everybody here is pretty, pretty crafty, pretty smart.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I don't think I know of any lunatics in this chat.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Everybody is pretty brilliant, especially as we saw last week, man.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Everybody, everybody has something to say something to add.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I'd love every single person in here.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Implementing closed loop processes.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Oh, I think I'm stumbling upon a conversation in the chat here.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
You guys keep going and I'll get the summary at the end.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Definitely has hundreds of USAP whistleblowers in there.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Correct.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
A lot, trust me as I've spent an uncomfortable amount of time pouring through the UFO witnesses list.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And I plan to make multiple more videos on hold on.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Let me actually ask you a question.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:54.000
There are a lot of sources that I want to cover in the redacted files that I have some interesting information on.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Even if I can't talk to these people, because there are some others who I've identified who I'm trying to talk to.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Even if I can't talk about them, do you guys still want me to cover them?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Or is that kind of like a not as interesting?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
There's like a seven to 10 other people I would like to cover, but I've been hesitant to do so unless I have spoken to them.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000
But if you guys still want to see that, even just kind of my research on there, I would gladly do that as well.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Gladly.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I appreciate it, Myer, that you speak your mind.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
That's the martial artist and you thank you very much.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I got to be careful speaking my mind.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I think just because I have a platform where I make videos, it's just important to kind of say when I don't know something.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I'll speak my mind, but then I'll say if it's got some nonsense in there, then I'll say it.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Have you heard about the big homie sea?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah, let me let me grab a quick drink of water.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I'll do it away from the mic so I don't sound like a slurper in the mic.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I have.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I find it interesting, but I'm there's not much for me to investigate there, but it is interesting.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Doty's sauce.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I was surprised to make connections to lose book.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Doty is very stuff.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Sorry.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You should research the connection between DMT and NHI.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I forgot the name of the researcher who wrote that book, but he was working with John Mack.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
That's not the work of no, that's not Terrence McKenna.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
He worked with psilocybin.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Right.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I actually would like to pursue that more.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I think it's very interesting because there's there's the claims of like Alex Jones of DMT and NHI, but then there's a lot more grounded research.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So I would like to go down that rabbit hole.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
You staff disinformation agent.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I think Doty was AFSOI, right?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Maybe I targeted Benowitz.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Yes.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Crazy committed suicide.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Yes.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
These are all great points for anybody kind of looking into Doty.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Why all the hate on Greer?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I think people just have very hot and cold opinions on Greer.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I don't think that as that's much hate as it is people being rightfully critical of Greer.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Now, people are often very critical of Greer and I support that, but I also preach time and time again.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It's also important to give Greer credit where credit is due because Greer has done incredible work in the field of ufology would not be where it is today without Greer.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Absolutely not.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Hey, Towney 3057.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Thank you for the Australian 30 bucks.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I really appreciate that, man.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank you so much for tuning in.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Thank you very much.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Other than personal opinions, what's the deal about Greer?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:40.000
This is just kind of what we discussed earlier that with a lot of witnesses, he will kind of make their story his own as kind of I saw firsthand and kind of make himself the center of everything in his event today.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:52.000
He practices terrible operational security stating that he cares for the sanctity of whistleblowers and their anonymity, but he violates OPSEC horrifically in the worst way I have ever seen with TV.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I grappled with even publishing that his account for so long with TV because I knew that anybody could just hop on the DPI archive and find a name associated with it within seconds.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:11.000
But Greer violates OPSEC and I just don't think he does enough work to vet all of the people who contact him.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I think anybody who kind of contacts him, if there's a story there, he just throws it into the witness list, right?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Because there's in the witness list, I think it's just stuff for quantity over quality because there's so many names in that that are just like point of contact to other witnesses.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And that stuff should just be used for internal use, right?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Like there's no need for the average researcher like me to get any value out of witness.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
This isn't an actual number, but 11067 who is a point of contact to other points of contact.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
There's nothing of value there.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Flying Lotus, thank you so much, dude.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I appreciate that.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I think coming up Flying Lotus and I are going to play some Black Ops as it comes out.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.000
If anybody else wants to play some Black Ops with us, we'll do it in the Discord and that should be a ton of fun.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
A ton of fun.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Faking CE5 stuff, I've seen nothing about the CE5, so I really don't kind of know anything about that.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But I do struggle with the images he posts that are supposedly CE5 stuff.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
It's just kind of lights.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And as we saw with the saucer photo that was taken from a Chile case that as far as we know, Greer is not associated with that case.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And again, I just want to say this again.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I know I'm being very critical of Greer, but I could also spend an equal amount of time celebrating the great work he's done.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I'm just going to shout out again the interview he did with Jonathan Wagan, which is a wonderful piece.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And you can read the actual written description in the DPI archive.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:43.000
In the 2001 disclosure briefing document, he also provides his estimate on the Black Operation situation in terms of how this program operates quasi-nationally,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:54.000
basically performs off the books, has almost mastered extraterrestrial technology, commands ARVs and so forth.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Excellent piece.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I do need to state that Greer did in fact, maybe it's not necessarily a brief, but did speak to Admiral Thomas Wilson amongst others about UFOs in 97.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
That is true.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
That dude, you are that dude telekinesis beats.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Thank you very much.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Philip Corso is the smoking gun.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Philip Corso is excellent.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I have talked to an individual who the same they know some like inside stuff and corporations and they have recommended Corso, a lot of Corso's work.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So that's really interesting.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Greer has helped to further bring attention to UAP UFO, USO.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So in some aspects, he did some good for the topic, but it's a double edged sword.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So he's kept some that agreed.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I think that's a really good way to put a double edged sword with the bad with with the bad with Greer.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I'm going to start dosing in some of the good with Greer because even though a lot of today, today with the with the what's it called his event.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I know I've I harped on a lot of points saying like old Greer stuffed himself into here, but still all of this work is is out of decades, decades of labor, decades will be Milo.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I love you as well.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Thank you very much.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I guess we'll know moving forward who's full of crap and who isn't.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I very much hope so.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I absolutely hope so.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Any thoughts on Tim Ventura and friends?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Why do I know that name?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
You guys are going to roast me for not knowing Tim Ventura off the top of my head.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Somebody remind me and I will remember.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I will absolutely remember.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Do I have plans to collaborate with any other UFO related YouTube channels night shift invented?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I'm asking as they've shown keen interest in talking to you.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
No, that's not that's not so much my thing.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Collabs, Jesse Michaels and John Michael Gaudier.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Those are those are some collabs.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I'll be doing and I will be seeing Jesse Michaels this week.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And I can't wait for that because he just interviewed Lou and I can't wait to speak to him about that.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
That's going to be great.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Grubbs equals goat.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Thank you.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You are goat.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
You are the goat Django.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
What do you think about Harold Malmgren and former personal dental advisor Malmgren is extremely interesting.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And so is his daughter.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And I would like to speak to his daughter as she has made some excellent claims as well.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Excellent, excellent claims.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
What do you think about blood?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
So we discussed this last time I've remained similar to sans pretty agnostic to blood.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So I don't want to put forward an opinion on anything unless I have a kind of well versed research.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So I'll sit down, read some books about blood.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So watch some interviews and so forth.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And then I will form an opinion because I don't I don't want to just talk out of my behind.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I want your view on your research as opposed to your view on others.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I hope that's clear.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
A lot of people do great research here.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I think that I just like to model my research a little bit more on like the old school researcher like the Dolan or the string field.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I find power in the written word and I try to create something that would be a written word and translated into a video.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I like the chasing down leads.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I like I like a little this is the way to do.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I like a little less news of the day type stuff and a little more long research into a topic.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
That's just kind of how I like to do things.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I know everybody has their preference.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I know everybody has a preference.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Okay, let's go.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Don't don't you think it's weird that Rogan is suddenly super skeptical about all this?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I mean, from having a UAP in Lazare to not believe it anymore.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Why didn't Lou talk about his book?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Lou didn't talk about his book because Lou didn't want to sell his book on the podcast, which I very respect.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
You might have to just talk about the phenomenon.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000
It's interesting how whenever there's a UAP related guy on Joe Rogan, Mike Baker, the CIA, former CIA guy is right there to clean it up.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I think Baker has 14 appearances on Jerry.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
It's also really interesting to see Joe's.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I think Joe just likes to believe kind of what's in the cool conspiracy, right?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Because when he was really into UFOs, this was like 20 early or mid 2010s when the subject wasn't as popular as it was.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
There wasn't as much serious research.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And he just kind of liked that it was more of a conspiracy.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
In a way, I think he's a little bit more of a calm Eddie Bravo.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And we love Eddie Bravo.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Joe Rogan's episodes with Eddie Bravo and Alex Jones are some of the best entertainment you will ever see ever.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Speaking, your mind is potentially going to cost you.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Are you scared even a little?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.000
No, I mean, I've probably crossed some toes, but it's all good.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Rick Strassman, where have I heard that name before Lotus?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Where have I heard that name?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I've heard of Freedward Winterberg.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000
That name rings a bell, but I can't reference it off the top of my head.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I have come across the names Falcon and Condor.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I think this was actually a career witness in 1980s in reference to like a blue team as well.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I have to find those files, but yes, I have.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Greer presents himself in a polarizing way, but if he's right even 10% of the time, then he's a valuable addition.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:01.000
That's why everything that Greer puts out, I think needs to be researched independently from everything else and studied.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
People mainly criticize Greer because of CE5 and how he monetized it while appearing to provide no evidence that it works.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I think so.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I think that's a good point because a lot of the CE5 stuff is really pricey.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I think in my Discord, I did kind of like an event revenue of this event that he did today just to kind of get a ballpark picture.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I think the place in which he spoke in London housed like 800 people and we'll just say that it was at full capacity.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Between tickets in there are $75 and then webinar tickets and stuff.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I think it was like a gross of $45,000 and this wasn't counting the 1,500 to sit and have dinner with Greer.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I just think he pushes the monetary incentive pretty heavy because he especially asks for donations and stuff for DPI archives.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I think he just really pushes that.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I'm not too well versed in psychedelics so I don't know how much I can answer there.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Greer just in terms of the impact is made.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's up there with Jacques Villiers and Jean Mack and those figures he is.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Greer is on the Mount Rushmore of UFO researchers and I will say that.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Has Greer said anything recently about Lou Elizondo?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I think Greer is critical of Lou Elizondo and I'm trying to remember that right now, but I do think that.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I do think Greer is a charlatan.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I can understand why you think so.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
There is a disinformation campaign to ruin Greer's name, especially on Twitter.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I wouldn't be surprised, but I think Greer is one of those guys that they can just kind of let go and do his own thing because as you see in the comments, Greer is so polarizing.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Everybody is so polarized about Greer.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So many people think he might be a charlatan, so many people respect him, and so many people are in between.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
So I think Greer does that himself, to be honest.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
What are your thoughts on Rogan?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Isn't it sus, suddenly a skeptic anymore?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I find it weird to think about when he had guests like Travis Walton on and Bob.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I stay away from talking about Bob.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I've said this before because I want so badly to believe Bob.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I can't really look at his case with a critical analysis because if I see the discrepancies in education, I'll just try and explain it the way as best as I can.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:26.000
But Joe is so, so easy on Bob, especially when Bob had migraines when he couldn't answer a question.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:36.000
But Joe, when he spoke to Grosh in particular, I know because I've watched that interview like 50 times, was extremely harsh and not a very gracious host, in my opinion.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Greer has beef with Elizondo.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Yes.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Sorry for repeating the question.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It didn't come through before.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I wanted to ask what made you consider the phenomenon being real?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
For me, it was the Nimitz incident since I am into jets.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
That's a good one.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I think that, I don't know if there was one specific incident that made me just say, Holy cow, the phenomenon is real just because I've been studying this since I was just so young.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:16.000
In my mind, just with all the encounters I read about, especially when I was young, I was really into air force sightings and dog, not dog fights with craft, but like military sightings because I was so into military jets and UFOs.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I've just always been like the back of my head until I reached an older age, just kind of had to assume there was validity to this and so forth.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
So I don't think there, I would like to hear from you guys, what was your like shining moment that made you say, Holy cow, this is real.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
I'd like to hear that from you guys.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Rogan, Mike Baker, every time you talk, yeah, that's really funny.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Lou said a prominent member of the disclosure movement is disinfo.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
He was probably referring to Greer.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Yeah, that was on a Sean Ryan, right?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
No, that was Timber Shet, I think it was on the Sean Ryan show.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:55.000
He referred to, maybe I'm thinking of a different incident, but Timber Shet says something similar.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I feel like you should do a video on DMT research in NHI as some people see entities on doing DMT.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
That'd be fun.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I'd like that, but I will have to do a lot of research because I know very, very, very little about, I know very little about psychedelics, very little.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I really think we should, yeah, I'm just not well versed.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
People like to crap on Greer for the sake of saying something.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
They don't bother doing the research and go very deep on it.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
ARV, Psychotronics, EMWs, DEWS, MKUltra, et cetera.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I completely agree.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.000
A lot of the way Greer phrases stuff is very outlandish and standoffish.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.000
So even stuff like P3 and Consciousness Connection Greer has been talking about for a while.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And I fell into the pitfall you're talking about, about kind of brushing that stuff golf because I thought it was a little too far fetched for me to pay attention to until I really started kind of sitting back and thinking about things.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Have you ever done any videos on June Crane?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I have not, but that would be interesting.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Did you read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I didn't read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman, but I have read about the Corona crash and talked about it with Ryan Wood.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And I think Wood as well as, I think James Rigney, the guy who leaked the Wilson Davis documents, thinks that some details of Roswell are kind of mixed in with other crashes around the same time.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And one of those is Corona and so forth.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
What's your take on Rogan recently?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I think you got warned by Feds to stop talking too much.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I want to be surprised.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I used to be a big Joe Rogan listener, but I feel like the quality of guests have died off and the talking points aren't nearly as interesting to me.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
What have you heard of Harry Drew and do you think he is honest?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
That is very interesting.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I have, I spoke about Harry Drew and the Kingman Crash very recently.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000
A certain, I'm not going to say their name just because I don't know if they want to kind of talk about that they're working on this.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:53.000
But an interesting channel and myself were trying to track down Harry Drew's documentary about what he had a documentary about Kingman.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And we've been trying to track that down right now.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
It's only been really a DVD that was sold with his book on Kingman.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I can't remember what it's called right now.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Like the fifth day in May or something like that.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I'm trying to remember what it's called.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
But yeah, Harry Drew is the person that proposed that there were three Kingman crashes.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
The first was a controlled descent.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:18.000
The second or first was a controlled descent and the second two were crashes, two of which contained bodies as well.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
And this occurred over in late May, 1953.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Harry Drew is really interesting.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I need to track down that dang documentary.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Ross Campbell says Kingman is extremely important.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I agree.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I think it's crucial to track down that dang documentary and continue to study.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I like to think back to the Chris Mellon signal exchange.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:45.000
He released with a USG individual who talked about an SES gatekeeper in the Air Force and Kingman.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Joe got warned big time.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I think it's very possible.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I'm sorry.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I'm trying to keep up with everything.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
If we talk about something, then like five minutes later, I get to the comment.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I'm sorry about that, guys.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Mike Baker talks for hours and says nothing.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
He does.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I remember back in like 2017, I saw a Mike Baker episode and I said, Holy cow.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
What's it going to be?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And this guy just jabbers, jabbers, jabbers, jabbers on with, with not much interesting

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
to say.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I dig Greer's view on drones versus UAP.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I have a feeling he's on to something.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
The KMO drones jellyfish is a big retriever for DoD.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Yeah.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I found more and more.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I've warmed up to the idea that there's a more of a mix of ARV versus UAP according to Greer.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Bradley, what's up?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
You have missed quite a lot and I would recommend starting from the beginning because we talked

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
about Greer's entire presentation today.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Rick Strasman.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I know Rick.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Okay.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yes.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Okay.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I will read that.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I will read that.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
That sounds really interesting.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I think Rogan might still believe.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Yeah.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Probably with that with how big Rogan is, he probably is just bombarded with so much as

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
well.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
So much.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.500
Maybe people who are just claiming to have sightings and so forth that he just is a little

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.500
bit jaded to the topic, which is crazy to me if he is jaded to the topic because he'll

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:06.500
have guys like Lou and Grush on and kind of treat them not as pleasantly as I would have

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.500
thought.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.500
Are you familiar with the alleged crash of a man made triangular ARV in East Germany?

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.500
Was that in?

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.500
Let me get out a copy of Magic Eyes Only.

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:19.500
What year was that in?

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:20.500
Sorry.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.500
I dropped my water bottle.

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.500
I need to find out what year that was in.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:34.500
I want to say 80s, maybe earlier, but I do remember that case.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.500
Okay.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.500
Kai, I will look for you because I have heard of that case.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.500
You're saying it was Mark McCandlish.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.500
He talked about it.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:42.500
Was that when he talked?

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.500
Okay.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:44.500
Let me see.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:45.500
I know I've heard about that.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.500
I'm just having trouble referencing.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.500
I appreciate the piece on Michael.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.500
He will be anointed hero.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.500
I hope so.

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:54.500
I would very much like for Michael to be able to speak a little more.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:55.500
Very much like that.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.500
I appreciate Lou for being humble that he doesn't mention his book out late,

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.500
despite essentially living in an ARV with his wife facing economic hardship.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.500
Since speaking out about UAP, UFO, USO, et cetera.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:05.500
Yeah.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500
Whatever your view is on Lou, it is respectful that especially on JR,

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500
he doesn't mention his book once.

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.500
Once.

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.500
Falcon and Condor.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.500
Yeah.

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.500
Aviary codenames.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500
Rick Dodie is one of them.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.500
I think John B. Alexander is another.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.500
Oh, and this was a witness.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.500
A H A H in the Greer archive.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:28.500
I can't remember exactly what name it is.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.500
Slimy Toad made me fart real bad.

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.500
Well, maybe you shouldn't take Slimy Toad, brother.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:37.500
Seriousness aside, Greer looks like a reptilian wearing a human meat suit.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500
I hope he's not a secret reptilian.

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.500
Is there a chance the government actually works together on this behind the curtains?

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500
Why?

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.500
Yes.

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Five eyes to a degree.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.500
Five eyes nations.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:52.500
US, UK, New Zealand, Australia and Canada work together on this.

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.500
You can look at a 2023 memo from Canadian politician Larry McGuire to the Canadian

01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:01.500
Minister of Defense that speaks about being more transparent about five eyes

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500
working together with UAP.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:08.500
If you listen to the UK whistle or sorry, the infographics whistleblower I covered

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.500
and you take that testimony as a real testimony or just somebody giving a real

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:15.500
testimony, you remember that Europe and many countries in Europe have been a default

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:20.500
agreement with the US that the US gets ownership of those technologies.

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.500
Really respect your view on Greer.

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:25.500
Obviously you have issues with him, but you don't turn a blind eye to his data.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.500
Absolutely not.

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:31.500
The DPI archive has been a true gift, a true gift.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.500
I have tried Greer CE5 protocols myself at home.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.500
It worked.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.500
Objects legit started appearing, disappearing, flashing, interacting with my thoughts.

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.500
I would like to hear more at what elevation did they appear?

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:42.500
Were they just light sources?

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.500
Could you make out like a tangible craft design?

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.500
Tell us more.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.500
I think that's very interesting.

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.500
Very interesting.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:55.500
Tim Ventura works at all propulsion, APEC works with Mark Sockle, Charles Bueller, Drew

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.500
Arajima.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:02.500
Yes, I have heard of this, heard of him, but I've never really dove into any of his

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.500
work.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.500
Sorry.

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.500
How many whistleblowers do you think will appear at the next UAP hearing?

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:14.500
Probably right now, I don't have very high hopes for many.

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:18.500
I think the 2023 congressional hearings, there were supposed to be two additional

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.500
whistleblowers that didn't show up.

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:27.500
I would hope more, but with whistleblower protection right now in terms of not safeguarding

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:32.500
people's pensions, I don't know how many people want to do that.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:35.500
There are too many people who focus on the people more than the content.

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:36.500
Yes.

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.500
I 100% agree.

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.500
Well put.

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:43.500
Falcon was, yes, I believe it was, I believe Falcon was Richard Dodie.

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.500
Wow, we're just getting to the Grush and JR Retalk.

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:49.500
Yeah, he was standoffish with Grush.

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:55.500
Joe was kind of just like really laissez-faire with that, kind of relaxed and taken very

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:56.500
seriously.

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.500
Rogan Krabs on Grush and Lou behind their backs, but he blindly defends Lazare.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.500
Yeah, it seems like he has a big problem with Grush and then the TTSA crowd.

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.500
The releasing is not right wing.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:11.500
You asked politics is a mess, a mess.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:14.500
Your video on the private sector should be required viewing for anyone in the community

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.500
and any conspiracy communities.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.500
This is so big.

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.500
I appreciate that.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.500
Thank you.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:25.500
Are you talking Battelle, Lockheed or SAIC?

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:29.500
Timbershed recently said that next hearings will likely primarily consist of scientists

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.500
and more pilots.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.500
Yeah.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:36.500
As much as I enjoy hearing about Ryan Graves, we need firsthand testimony of the people

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:41.500
that Greer says he's talking to about people who have actually retrieved craft, like he

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:44.500
said, who flew him over the Hellendale plant.

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:45.500
Rogan is being led by gatekeepers.

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.500
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.500
We should deep dive CEO of these companies with special access programs.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
I bet something surfaces.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.500
Someone was, but oh, that reminds me.

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:59.500
Greer said his uncle was the Grumman in Northrop Grumman, but that he had no knowledge of

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:00.500
UAP situations.

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.500
I would like to look into CEOs, as well as some head-up scientists.

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:09.500
We talked about this last week, but Lockheed Martin and Jim Ryder, as mentioned in Lou

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.500
Elizondo's book, Eminent.

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.500
I think there's a lot of interesting people we could study.

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:18.500
As well as looking at board of directors of companies and their previous relationships

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:22.500
in terms of work on the CIA, because you have Ronald Moultrie, who's on the board of directors

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.500
for the Carlisle Group.

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:28.500
He was a big with Sean Kirkpatrick and so forth.

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:29.500
There's a lot of great connections.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.500
For me, it was Mark McCandless.

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:31.500
I see what you're saying.

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.500
Mark McCandless broke that ground for you.

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.500
Mark McCandless's story is excellent.

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:42.500
I really want to cover it in full detail and give it the true justice it deserves.

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.500
David Fraber got me started after that.

01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.500
The testimonies are just impossible to know, both in quality and quantity.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.500
Everything else seems like rumors to me, but I still find them interesting.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:53.500
I remember when the Tic Tac case, when Fraber really started talking about his experience

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:59.500
on Joe Rogan and so forth, that felt monumental.

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:03.500
Real when David Grush came forward and I started researching and here I am.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:09.500
If you were led here by Grush, I couldn't think of anything better.

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500
Shining Moment was actually Bob Lazar interview with Rogan.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:15.500
I believe everywhere he says from there, I started exploring rabbit holes.

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:16.500
Interesting.

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.500
Bob Lazar is, of course, so contentious.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:24.500
I love, I could talk about Bob all dang day, all day.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.500
Okay.

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:29.500
Flying Lotus, if you're still here, is Brainfeeder taking fall interns?

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:33.500
I can also text him about that.

01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.500
I know, I will text him about that.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:39.500
I didn't even know this stuff was going on until I saw the Nimitz incident,

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.500
which Nimitz incident would lead me to the hearing, which made me realize that

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.500
an experience I had was 100% of UAP.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.500
Tell me about it.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.500
That's really interesting.

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.500
You can either tell me about it here in the Discord because I would really like to hear

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:50.500
that.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.500
McKinnon, let's just filmmaker was poisoned.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.500
I forgot.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:54.500
Yeah.

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.500
Greer said in this, sorry, I'll probably have details about the event come to me.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:59.500
Greer stated that four people he has worked with have been killed.

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.500
I have not seen evidence for that, but he did state that.

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.500
He did state that.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.500
I was attacked by a Translucent Bean when I was 19 or 20.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.500
I was in between sleep and awake and it wasn't a dream.

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.500
It was like a tentacle pearl Translucent Bean.

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
That sounds horrifying.

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:14.500
Horrifying.

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.500
That sounds very scary.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:23.500
Like in a hypnagogic state almost.

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.500
Respect your comment on old school research first news of the day.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.500
I'm just an old school guy.

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:32.500
That's why I like wrestling with people and studying UFOs.

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.500
Greer is way ahead of Congress.

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.500
Even he is another level.

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:39.500
Greer is way, way ahead of Congress.

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500
Even he is another level research.

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:42.500
Him.

01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.500
He's.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500
I agree with you, Alan.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
I don't know what you're saying, but I agree.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.500
I met Greer's first time doing DMT.

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.500
It was expecting machine elves and fractals.

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:54.500
It was more real than real.

01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:57.500
I don't know anything about UFO and Greer lore prior.

01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.500
Now, after getting involved in UFO lore,

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:05.500
would you say these Greys that you saw are kind of like the classic depiction of Greys?

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.500
Me and the homies are all a girl build.

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500
I hope everybody is, man.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500
How do I get in contact with these whistleblowers?

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:15.500
I would definitely like to do a video of myself on some of these people.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
Is it because of your following?

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500
Not likely.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.500
For how I got in contact with Michael, for example, you guys know this.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500
I first got in contact with Joey.

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.500
Any of the people I've covered, like MSTB,

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:34.500
I have gone really far out of my way to contact these people.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:41.500
Discerning the names on the DPI archive has taken anywhere from five minutes with TB to a week

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500
to try to find these names.

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500
Then, of course, it involves contacting these people,

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.500
seeing if they'll be willing to talk.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:53.500
I can't tell you how. I have a dozen people who have told me no, not interested.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:56.500
I mean, the name is listed in the archive.

01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:59.500
I'm going to double check the archive because I don't want to burn the name if it's not there.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:04.500
But there was a doctor that Greer stated had a UAP encounter on a ship,

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:10.500
on a Navy ship who a UAP came out of the water,

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:16.500
landed nearby and basically destroyed some of the local surroundings just with its landing.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:21.500
In the archives with Greer, this individual also apparently had a point of contact

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:26.500
to a former Navy SEAL who was in charge of tracking UAPs coming out of a certain location.

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.500
I don't know what this location is underwater.

01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.500
I contacted this person.

01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:36.500
I said, and I will say who the person is next live if I find their name is still in the DPI archive

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.500
because it's listed out right.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.500
But I contacted this person. They're an elderly doctor.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500
And I said, hey, would you be interested in talking about this?

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500
I found your name in the DPI archive.

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:46.500
They didn't say no, it's not true.

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.500
They just said, I'm not interested.

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:51.500
And kind of a little back and forth with them telling me to kind of get lost.

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:54.500
So that was pretty dang interesting to me.

01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.500
Seven days in May, that's it.

01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:59.500
I was almost, I was almost on it.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:02.500
Almost on it.

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:07.500
When I said I wanted your views, it was in reference to whistleblowers you haven't spoken to directly.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.500
Oh, okay.

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.500
Whistleblowers I haven't spoken to directly.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.500
Well, I would like to speak to them.

01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:17.500
I just really enjoy talking to a lot of these people.

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:23.500
But there are a lot of prospective whistleblowers I will be trying to contact soon.

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500
Large light formation hanging low in the sky.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500
Unbelievable color and formation free.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500
Mental Western Australia in 2005.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500
Tell me more about it.

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.500
What did this formation do?

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:34.500
What color was it and so forth?

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:41.500
Have you heard anything about the UAP so big it was presumably buried under something?

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:46.500
Of course, TB has spoken about one buried in Seoul, South Korea and his notes.

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:51.500
I think there are some people that think that the UAP Ross Colt Hart is referring to that was so big,

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:55.500
which I'm certain that you're referring to is in Pine Gap Australia.

01:46:55.500 --> 01:47:02.500
I have not received any sort of interesting intelligence or kind of investigation on that subject.

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.500
I know very little about it.

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:09.500
I know very little about it, but I just don't even know where to begin researching where that site may be.

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:10.500
June Crane is worth a video.

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.500
Okay.

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.500
Her statements corroborate.

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.500
Roswell and her credentials are proven.

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.500
She had Q clearance.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:17.500
Researcher interviewed is still alive today and is extremely kind.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.500
Former LEO.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.500
Okay.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.500
I will.

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.500
I would absolutely do that and try and contact that guy.

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:30.500
You know, we, we need the Greer and Herrera insider to come forward publicly and end this debate once and for all to expose PLF,

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.500
Psychotronics used in fake abduction, ARVs, EMW attacks.

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.500
I completely agree.

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:41.500
I think this individual coming forward will, will, would be monumental,

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.500
especially if this person came forward with evidence.

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.500
I would like to see that.

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.500
Literally trying to get bro to the loose and they listen.

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:54.500
I don't, I don't do, I don't do, uh, I don't do any substances, but I don't have problems of people do if they're an adult.

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.500
And that's what they, that's what they choose to do.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.500
It's, it's their body, their choice.

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:06.500
Uh, man's doesn't look like he needs any more trouble keeping it together.

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500
Keep kicking butt.

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:09.500
Best show on the topic.

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:10.500
I appreciate that man.

01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:11.500
Much love.

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:12.500
Thank you very much.

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:13.500
That means the most.

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:16.500
Uh, sorry.

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.500
Greer was telling the truth about Admiral Wilson's briefing documents.

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:20.500
He's telling the truth for decades.

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.500
No one believed him.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.500
Doesn't that tell you something?

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.500
Absolutely.

01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:24.500
Absolutely.

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:25.500
It does Greer.

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:35.500
I mean, I think Admiral Wilson even admitted to speaking to Greer, but even when he still denied the, the, sorry, my brain's being scared.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:39.500
Even when he denied the allegations of the Wilson Davis memo being true, but Greer did do that.

01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.500
Yes.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.500
That's why I think that is why I took the approach.

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:46.500
I did it with Greer's witnesses that they really need to be investigated.

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.500
The filter.

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.500
Who has big eyes?

01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:52.500
Let me know who, let me know who has, who has the big eyes.

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.500
Like, I'd like to hear about that.

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.500
Love what you do.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.500
Keep the deep eyes.

01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:57.500
Thank you for training your excellent work.

01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:00.500
Had some weird results with CE5 over the years, but recommended even if it's just to go stargazing.

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.500
I would like to hear about this.

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:03.500
Absolutely.

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:04.500
Please.

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.500
Mark.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.500
Yes.

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.500
This is important to know about Mark.

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.500
Mark was an aerospace contractor illustrator.

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.500
He did a ton of work, a ton of great work.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:18.500
And he also has a lot of interesting points of contact and so forth.

01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:22.500
Let me get some cold brew.

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:23.500
Sorry guys.

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:27.500
Remember when Dodie said ETs like straw?

01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:28.500
Did he?

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:34.500
I don't remember him saying that, but I, I don't, I don't, I don't doubt that.

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.500
Have you had a UAP setting up some kind?

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:37.500
Yeah.

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:38.500
I talked about this last time.

01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:41.500
I don't ever really talk about it just because it's, it's not too big of a deal.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:47.500
You know, I think like many people have had experiences just where I've seen these strange

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:52.500
lights in the sky, strange formations doing zigzagging in the sky and so forth, but no

01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:56.500
tangible actual craft or an actual structure I could make out.

01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:01.500
And I would talk about it more if I had, if I myself had seen the exact body of a saucer

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:02.500
or a triangle.

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:05.500
The five eyes things makes a lot of sense when you start looking at the way the internet

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:09.500
globally, NC and AU are high or handy just based on geography.

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.500
Absolutely.

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:11.500
Absolutely.

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:15.500
I also think there's a lot of interesting Australia stuff to, to study.

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:18.500
Rogan is skeptical of anything coming from the government to be honest.

01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:21.500
Chuck Schumer, Hilly Clinton being involved in disclosure is kind of weird.

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.500
There's evidence Hillary has known something.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:24.500
Yeah.

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.500
With John Podesta.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:26.500
Absolutely.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:27.500
That is weird.

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:30.500
And maybe that ties into what we talked about at the beginning of this live stream where

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:35.500
we were talked about first being approached to buy white hats or blue team under the Clinton

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:36.500
administration.

01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.500
Who knows?

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:38.500
Okay.

01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:45.500
I was told UAP is hide in our underground aquifer surfacing through connected lakes and streams.

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:46.500
They are well hidden.

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.500
That is, that is very interesting.

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:53.500
That is very interesting, especially with stories of UAP kind of appearing from lakes and so

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.500
forth.

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:55.500
That's actually really interesting.

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.500
I've never heard that.

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:59.500
Your spine on your, yeah, that's a good point.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:02.500
Five eyes, five eyes joint intelligence.

01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.500
What are your thoughts on the UFO that is way too big to move?

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.500
Elizondo was asked about it in a recent interview.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:08.500
We just talked about this.

01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.500
That is from the, I think originally proposed by Ross Colt Hart.

01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.500
I've heard some people say South, South Korea.

01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500
Some people say Pine Gap Australia.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:21.500
I don't know what that, I don't know what the heck to think.

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:22.500
Really Greer is worth researching.

01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.500
The guy is a lot more in the know than anyone else in the field.

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.500
Chris is life dedicated to this and what's the trauma surgeon?

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.500
Absolutely.

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:35.500
That is why I have dedicated probably two hours of every single day to studying Greer's materials.

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:38.500
Absolutely.

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:41.500
Greed with all this witness folks on favorite graves.

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.500
There are so many, many better cases and witnesses out there.

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:44.500
I agree.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:47.500
One of those I'd like to see is Mr. TB.

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.500
Great point mentioning Hellendale radar cross-section facilities.

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.500
Definitely a place worth keeping an eye on.

01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:56.500
It was as was the Lockheed Lighthouse in Virginia.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.500
Yeah, that's an interesting location to mention.

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:02.500
Again, if you weren't here when we talked about the Hellendale site earlier,

01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:05.500
Greer in his symposium today talked about Hellendale,

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:08.500
posted pictures of it, said he was flown over this site,

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.500
but didn't mention Hellendale.

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:17.500
Also checked the DPI archive and found it very strange that all sort of images of Hellendale

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.500
in reference to Hellendale were kind of taken off the photo site.

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:24.500
Greer in graves are such experienced pilots as were the radar operators.

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:25.500
Yes.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.500
No, I think the balloon.

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:32.500
Yeah, those cases are not, especially multi-sensor detection like that.

01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:33.500
No.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.500
What are your thoughts about the Soviet Union UFO cases where UFO above a nuclear silo

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.500
is activated multiple nuclear ICBMs?

01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:41.500
Yeah, that's so interesting because of course, in a lot of our cases here,

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:45.500
but not AFB, any cases of malabstrom around nuclear arms.

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:50.500
It always seems like that the Minutemen missiles or the ICBMs are basically effectively rendered useless

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:53.500
and there are Russian cases about them almost being activated.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:56.500
I don't know what to think about that, to be honest.

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:59.500
Really don't.

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:07.500
I can't remember, I can't prove it, but I remember reading Trump was only briefed on UAP.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:13.500
You're remembering that from Lou and Ross Colthart have both said that.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:16.500
Why would our UAP moderators claim Greer is a charlatan?

01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:19.500
I had a post removed a while back after sharing a link to one of his documents.

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.500
I think that's kind of bogus.

01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:28.500
Sharing Greer documents is kind of wild to just say that's a disinformation or not true.

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:29.500
That would be huge.

01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:30.500
Appreciate it.

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:31.500
Been talking with the stones.

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:35.500
You've been talking with stones for recently, but brain feed or internship would be a dream.

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.500
How can I send you my contact info?

01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.500
Either join the Discord.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.500
I'll post the link in the here.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.500
Sorry.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:44.500
I need to remember how to invite people.

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.500
I'll post the Discord link in here.

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.500
Otherwise, UAPGIRB at gmail.com.

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:51.500
Here's the Discord link if anybody would like to join.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:55.500
There's been some good discussion today and you can see all my notes as they were from

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.500
today's presentation.

01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.500
Heaps of short boys.

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.500
Guys, can you hear me?

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.500
I think I accidentally just left the live.

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.500
If anybody can hear me, let me know.

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:22.500
Let me know if you can hear me.

01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.500
Okay.

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.500
I think I'm still live.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.500
Somebody let me know, please.

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:28.500
Okay.

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:29.500
Great.

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.500
I'm sorry.

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500
I accidentally just hit a, I have one of those gaming, gaming mouses.

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.500
So I actually just backed out.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.500
I'm going to try to find out exactly where I was.

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.500
I'm very sorry for that, guys.

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.500
Okay.

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:40.500
Here we go.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:41.500
Sorry about that, guys.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.500
My bad.

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500
I went into UAP with three others about 15 years ago.

01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.500
It looked to be a green shooting star.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.500
It fell long enough to call attention to it.

01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.500
Then accelerated to a 45 degree England disappeared.

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:54.500
That's very interesting, especially with the case I'm covering right now being labeled a

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:56.500
meteor until it turned 25 degrees.

01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:00.500
So that is a, that's really interesting to hear the flying lotus.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:03.500
Yes, flying, flying lotus is a fan of the Gerb channel.

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.500
And I'm a fan of his music.

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.500
Excellent music.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:10.500
I'm surprised there hasn't been anyone who takes psychedelics before doing CE5.

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:16.500
Because we know the, the P3 people are given a cocktail of drugs before they're what we

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:19.500
would call their version of CE5 experience.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.500
I wanted to know what I've seen ever since.

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.500
No idea what it could do.

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.500
These things I saw it do.

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:31.500
I, when you see impossible feats in the sky, there's a very, very strange.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:34.500
Let's go to, is it triangle formation?

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.500
Okay.

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.500
You were talking about your UFO sighting triangle formation, triangle light formation above

01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:42.500
your garden, coming to a sudden stop, changing colors, pulsating, suddenly skipping, flying

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:44.500
off into an instant at the speed of a modern day jet.

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:50.500
I wonder if that is like a TR3B or some ARV.

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.500
People love dismissing plant-based contact experience.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.500
I think so.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:00.500
Again, I don't have a lot of, I'm pretty uninformed on any sort of psychedelic.

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:06.500
So I, my opinion is probably one of the most ill-informed, ill-informed out there.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.500
It still amazed me that Schumer Rounds Memo doesn't get more attention because the fact

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:13.500
they both pushed for it, yes, especially with 27 mentions of non-human intelligence, the

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:19.500
mention of legacy programs, the mention of UAP materials being misclassified under the

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:25.500
1954 atomic energy agreement under transclassified foreign nuclear materials.

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:29.500
Let's go.

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:32.500
Why should people take abduction cases from their beds seriously?

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:33.500
Why take any of this seriously?

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:38.500
I think in terms of abduction cases, especially from the bed, the research of John Mack was

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:43.500
used just to try and find similarities between, between kind of cases.

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.500
Anthony, thank you so much for the five bucks.

01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.500
Have I ever looked into the Eiger 1992 video?

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:51.500
The detail in the life form makes it hard to debunk.

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:59.500
Let me, I feel like I've heard of that.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:02.500
Let me get back to you on that because I feel like I've heard of that video.

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:06.500
I can't recall it off the top of my head.

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.500
I love your logical no clickbait approach.

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.500
Your channel is massively under subscribed.

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.500
I appreciate that.

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:16.500
I hate clickbait because I grew up before clickbait was a real thing.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:21.500
So back in the day when there'd be videos saying like, oh, don't watch, don't, don't play

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.500
Minecraft at 3am, warning scary.

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:26.500
I, that just puts such a sour taste in my mouth.

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:27.500
Kai, thank you.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:30.500
I see it and I can't wait to talk to you about that after watching it.

01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.500
It's sad what happened to Mark.

01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:33.500
Absolutely.

01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.500
Hey, what's up, Aussie, my Aussie brethren.

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.500
Nice to see you, man.

01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:40.500
Why are there so many Democrats involved in disclosure?

01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:43.500
Interesting question, especially kind of Clinton, Podesta and so forth.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:48.500
Now it's a, hopefully we can continue this issue being a little bit more middle of the aisle.

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:51.500
Some of the best UAP contract content out there.

01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.500
I appreciate that man.

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.500
Seriously, much love.

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500
That, that means the most.

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:59.500
Um, let's see.

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:04.500
Let's get to a video debunking Mick West claims.

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:05.500
That would be fun.

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:09.500
I see, I leave that to guys like Merrick Von Damic.

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.500
I can never say his last name.

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:16.500
I leave, leave that to men like that who are a little bit more well versed in their claims

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:20.500
of counter analyses because I don't have the same analysis skills on sightings and so forth

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:24.500
as Merrick does to kind of counter Mick West's claims and so forth.

01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:28.500
Of course I could when he says stuff just really out of pocket stuff when it comes to

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:32.500
kind of, uh, whistleblowers and so forth.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.500
That would be, uh, let's see.

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:38.500
Hillary wanted disclosure, but Obama got out of the way to comment on UFOs and was making a Betty.

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:44.500
That is weird that, uh, that Obama is now producing a Betty and Barney Hill documentary.

01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.500
I haven't heard any update on that.

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:50.500
If you, I first met Greer in the nineties in Pensacola, Florida at Sacred Heart Hospital.

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:54.500
He, he was a trauma surgeon at, uh, at Sacred Heart, right?

01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.500
I think that's where he was.

01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.500
Now the Illuminati in contact with the bad end at H.I.

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.500
And the ones being shot down are the good guys.

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.500
I don't know.

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:08.500
Of course I've heard of interfactionality of NHIs and ETs, but I'm not sure to which, to what extent that goes.

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.500
And of course you listened to David Grush talk about agreements with NHI.

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:15.500
I'm not sure, uh, what agreements have been made with whom.

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:18.500
Police chiefs across the U.S. have issued the first official.

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:19.500
That's very interesting.

01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:25.500
Ross Colard posted that last week providing law enforcement, uh, enforcement officers with instructions on how to report and respond.

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.500
Yes, that's great.

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:31.500
I'll link that in the discord because that's a, that's a really good document.

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:38.500
But from what I hear right when presidents are disproportionately briefed as there's a strong presence of fascist and or religious fundamentalists such as Collins Leighton, the program.

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:39.500
I've heard that too.

01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:45.500
Especially of interest being briefed who I think is a little overlooked is Lyndon B. Johnson.

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:47.500
I'll give you guys a little tasty treat right here.

01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:58.500
Um, Lyndon B. Johnson, you guys remember my video on Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who talked about Dr. Eric Walker being involved in UFO crash retrieval since the early 1950s with Vannevar Bush.

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:09.500
Robert Sarbacher also self admitted that he was part of UAP, uh, collection efforts as well as knew what the majestic 12 was as well as said he was himself present at the Kecksburg UFO crash in 1965.

02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:17.500
Well, Dr. Eric Walker and Lyndon B. Johnson had a very close correspondence where they would say send each other very personal letters.

02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.500
So that's really interesting to see a link between those two.

02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:26.500
Uh, what do I think of the eye?

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:28.500
I saw the image, but I never investigated further.

02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:35.500
Uh, maybe I will sometime, but there was just so much, uh, so much, there's just always so much going on so many cases to look at.

02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.500
Uh, Edgar Mitchell spoke about this.

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:42.500
Edgar Mitchell and, uh, uh, Gordon Cooper.

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.500
Very interesting guys.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500
What's up awakening to reality?

02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.500
How you doing, bro?

02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:47.500
How you doing?

02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:48.500
Loud and clear.

02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:49.500
Okay.

02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:50.500
I think this is when I just got back.

02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.500
If the feds got me, I'll go kicking and screaming, man.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:54.500
I'll go kicking and screaming.

02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:58.500
Hey, Jorgen, thank you for the 119 Norwegian Krona.

02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:01.500
How far back do you believe IC has investigated infiltrated the phenomena?

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:04.500
An example did O and I cover the Aurora incident.

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:05.500
That's a great question.

02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:07.500
I'd say at least 1933.

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:18.500
Um, the Aurora incident, I think is a case that really warrants a lot of investigation, especially due to some of the circumstantial, not really evidence, but, uh, circumstantial details of the case being really interesting, such as.

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:23.500
The idea that some of the craft parts were thrown down a well, which poisoned local residents and so forth.

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:28.500
Possibly before then, but I think maybe the earliest we could go is maybe 1897 with the Aurora incident.

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.500
But thank you again, man.

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.500
I really appreciate that.

02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:33.500
What do you think about the UAP tether incident?

02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:36.500
I knew you did a video on fast workers, but I don't remember if you covered that incident.

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:38.500
I don't think I did cover that incident.

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.500
Now I would actually like to cover the UAP tether incident.

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:48.500
Doing yourself a disservice by, uh, contact experiences, maybe look at the content of the experience for you right off as.

02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.500
Okay.

02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:50.500
I think you might be talking to somebody else.

02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:54.500
I, because I, I'm just not, not acknowledgeable.

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:55.500
Awaken into reality.

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:59.500
Thank you so much for the 899, uh, New Zealand dollars.

02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:00.500
Thank you very much.

02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:02.500
I really appreciate that, man.

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:05.500
The Eiger 1992 alien video is fake.

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:08.500
Tristan, I will have to, I absolutely have to watch that.

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:12.500
I think Democrat leaders are cock blocked from being briefed on the UFO compared to GOP since they may have balls.

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.500
Honestly, to further disclose if they get too much information, they're risky.

02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.500
That could be a valid point.

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.500
I like that hypothesis.

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:24.500
Interesting research done at Imperial College in London where different DMTs were used to map out the space.

02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:29.500
Oh, that is interesting to map out like a, uh, basically create a map of the space.

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:33.500
Hey, uh, I got, let me, let me go off on a quick tangent here, guys.

02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:38.500
Cause I probably won't get to this question about five minutes for any of my gamers in the chat.

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:41.500
Have any of you guys played the new war hammer space marines two game?

02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:46.500
I know I'll get to those questions in about five minutes, but I would like to read if anybody has, has read them.

02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:47.500
Uh, Von Rennen camp.

02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:48.500
That's it.

02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:52.500
He just appeared on a Ross Colt part and yes, I, I can't pronounce stuff.

02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:54.500
I, I just can't.

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:57.500
Did you watch Tom Begert and psychotronics lecture on how to achieve anti-gravity free energy?

02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:58.500
No, I have not yet.

02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:02.500
I still need to, I have been consumed with the case I'm working on right now.

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:05.500
And that is because it is a 23 page script.

02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:08.500
So it took me a heck of a long time.

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:13.500
Who are the world's best known living intellectual living intellectuals and public speakers?

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:16.500
Where are their comments on the phenomenon?

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:17.500
Uh, good question.

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:21.500
We could go with guys like Sir Roger Penrose and so forth.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.500
Some best known living intellectuals.

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:27.500
I don't think a lot of them have really, uh, spoken on, on the phenomenon.

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.500
John Doe.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:31.500
What's going on, brother?

02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:33.500
Do you believe the skinny Bob alien video?

02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:37.500
I try and stay away from that until there's, uh, a lot of the topics that have just kind

02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:38.500
of an endless debate.

02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:46.500
I try and stay away from just because if my research, if not a lot of research has been

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:50.500
advanced on something and maybe my research is just going to get caught in the same loop.

02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:55.500
Um, I might just kind of wait a little bit until I have something, some actionable information

02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.500
to pursue on, on stuff.

02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.500
And I do not on skinny Bob right now.

02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.500
As a youngster, I loved watching the dang video.

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:01.500
I'll tell you that much.

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:05.500
America is afraid of the phenomenon is communist Nazi, but they're becoming what they sought

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.500
to destroy.

02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.500
It's 40 chairs.

02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.500
Absolutely in the cold war and so forth.

02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:10.500
We absolutely were.

02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:11.500
Absolutely.

02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:14.500
It goes all the way back to, uh, project paperclip and Alan Dole's.

02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:15.500
Yes.

02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:18.500
Alan Dole is in, uh, the 1933 magenta crash.

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.500
The door's old boys.

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.500
Claudio, thank you so much for the 499.

02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:24.500
My apologies.

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.500
Donation for going off topic about internships and chat.

02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:27.500
Keep it up.

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:29.500
You and Jesse Michaels be such a good convo.

02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:30.500
No problem, man.

02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.500
This chat's open to anybody.

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:33.500
We're not going to restrict anything.

02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:35.500
Anybody says, but I really appreciate that.

02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.500
Thank you very much.

02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:39.500
Twist UAP Leonard Stringfield was one of the best UFO crash researchers.

02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:41.500
If true, his info is mind blowing.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:45.500
I'd like to take a second and I know I say this in every single video.

02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:49.500
And in my upcoming video, I will talk about Stringfield at length, but Stringfield is the

02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:50.500
best of the best.

02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:53.500
The UFO crash retrievals parts one through seven are sublime.

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:58.500
That is what I will stand by as the best ever work done on the subject in terms of crash

02:04:58.500 --> 02:04:59.500
retrievals.

02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:01.500
It is phenomenal sublime.

02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:02.500
Leonard Stringfield is the best.

02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:07.500
One of my personal dreams is to be able to access his personal records at Mufon Cincinnati,

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:13.500
sit with a, with a cold brew for 12 hours and read every single note he ever took.

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.500
The tether video is wild.

02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:15.500
Yes.

02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:20.500
The Cabal's goal is full spectrum of dominance as they say in official documents to achieve

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:22.500
that they need the whole world to unite around fear.

02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.500
Perfect way to do that is through a fake ET invasion, or as David Gresh would say, a

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:27.500
feudalistic dominance.

02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:29.500
And, and I agree.

02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:34.500
I'm still, I still have my problems with, with paper clip or the, I'm sorry, the idea

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.500
of project blue beam and so forth, but I do understand that point.

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:40.500
I do think the, I think the unbearable truth of the phenomenon might be that there's an

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.500
afterlife for everyone and the unbearable part is where the world collapses due to people

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.500
self-checking out.

02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.500
I think that was explored in a movie, right?

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:48.500
With Jason Seagal.

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.500
I don't think it was very good, but I think that concept was explored.

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:53.500
What would people do if they learned they had an afterlife?

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:54.500
That's an interesting idea.

02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:00.500
Oh, no, no worries with a, no worries with spam.

02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.500
Mrs. Floyd, thank you very much.

02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:03.500
Yes.

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.500
There's a lot of Norwegians here.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:08.500
Somebody even recognized the front line shirt, which is great.

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:11.500
The Danny Cheehan interview on Jesse Michaels American Alchemy show is amazing.

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:14.500
If anyone hasn't watched it, you watch, watch anything by Jesse Michaels.

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:18.500
Jesse Michaels is amazing and he has some really cool projects and the work that I think

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:19.500
you guys are really going to like.

02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.500
Jesse Michaels is the real deal.

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:23.500
Have I played No Man's Sky?

02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.500
One of the best, if not the best space games out there.

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:26.500
Yeah.

02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:28.500
I've played, I've played, I've done like four different playthroughs of it.

02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.500
I love it.

02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:33.500
There's nothing like having a nice crisp diet cola night and just flying through on your

02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:34.500
new S-class ship.

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:35.500
I love it.

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:40.500
Best thing I ate in Japan, that would probably have to be, um, yukatsu.

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:46.500
Yukatsu steak where you have steak cooked lightly, lightly fried on the outside with,

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:51.500
um, cooked to a rare medium rare and you're given like a hot plate basically to sear it

02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:55.500
how you want yourself to then dip it in the various sauces.

02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:56.500
It was sublime.

02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:58.500
One of the best things I've ever eaten.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:01.500
I feel like right wing presidents would be far more likely to disclose.

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:04.500
Conservatives are way, way more wary of big government and government outreach.

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:09.500
I agree, but do presidents have the ability to disclose?

02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:11.500
Penrose is the goat.

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:12.500
Absolutely.

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:13.500
Physics goat.

02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:17.500
SDS, 114 UFO video in space is weird.

02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:18.500
It makes a U-turn.

02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:19.500
One of the weirdest space.

02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:20.500
Yeah.

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:21.500
I think I put that in the fast walker video.

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:23.500
It's a very strange, strange video.

02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:27.500
If we created simulated realities like video games, why wouldn't the beans above us not do

02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:28.500
the same?

02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:29.500
I agree.

02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:30.500
Sorry.

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:31.500
You get a sip of water.

02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:32.500
Yeah.

02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:33.500
I agree.

02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:39.300
I think, um, I can't remember what podcast it was, but there's a man who did a podcast

02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:41.300
on simulation theory.

02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:43.300
And one of those was with the ability to simulate.

02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:46.300
There will be an endless amount of simulations.

02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:52.300
And we thus have a greater probability of being one of said simulations.

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:53.300
But by whom?

02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:54.300
I don't know.

02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:55.300
David of Salem.

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:57.300
My contact experience was a possible one.

02:07:57.300 --> 02:08:00.300
They seemed to take it back that I could see them as I was.

02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:02.300
It was like we abducted each other rather than mine.

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:07.300
I think I've heard that in some abduction cases of, of beans almost being surprised that they

02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:08.300
were, they have been noticed.

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:09.300
Cheers from Norway.

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.300
Cheers to you.

02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:12.300
I hope to be back to, to Norway soon, man.

02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:15.300
I love that some Norwegians watch, watch this channel.

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:19.300
It's, um, thoughts on the tall whites.

02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:20.300
The tall whites are interesting.

02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:24.300
Um, of course, with many gray sightings of abductees and so forth, there's a lot of the

02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:29.300
time like a tall white, as some people say, like venusians, mantis type beans alongside

02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:31.300
the, the gray, the drones.

02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:35.300
I don't know what to think because abductions isn't really my bread and butter.

02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:39.300
I still am just trying to investigate what the heck are some of the bodies that are discovered

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:40.300
at some of the crash sites.

02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:42.300
Phil Snyder, we talked about this before.

02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:44.300
Some of his claims are, are very interesting.

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:46.300
They're very big too.

02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:47.300
His claims are very big.

02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:52.300
And, uh, in terms of getting into a firefight underground with NHI where soldiers were basically

02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.300
turned to goop, uh, alongside him.

02:08:54.300 --> 02:09:00.300
But I have, I'm, I'm probably would start with researching his death if I do, if I do some

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:01.300
research into him.

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:05.300
The skinny Bob looks like CGI to me, but I want to believe that one.

02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:06.300
It does.

02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.300
It looks a little buttery.

02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.300
It looks a little buttery.

02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:15.300
Hey, dude, I hope the Browns lose because the bangles got beat by one of the worst teams

02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:16.300
in the NFL today.

02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:19.300
And I'm very upset.

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.300
We're skyfire, skyfire news.

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:22.300
I'm not quite sure.

02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.300
I am not quite sure.

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:28.300
Matilda O'Donnell Roswell interview mentioned a gray, didn't know English till I read the

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.300
book that night and they were, uh, over the White House.

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.300
Yeah.

02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:34.300
And what they, what were they over the White House?

02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:39.300
Um, a lot of Roswell witnesses, including the, um, including the photographer at Roswell

02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:40.300
mentioned grays.

02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:43.300
They are forced for peace and nuclear disarmament.

02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:45.300
They try and promote a message of peace.

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.300
They could have various effects on electronics on off.

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:48.300
Yeah.

02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:52.300
Kevin Knuth at his soul foundation, uh, did a lot of interesting talk about this with

02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:57.300
electric fields and magnetic fields of UAP and they're interacting with technology and

02:09:57.300 --> 02:10:00.300
so forth.

02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.300
Okay.

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:03.300
Sorry.

02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:05.300
Project blue beam is disinformation.

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:07.300
I tend to lead towards this too.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.300
It was made up by Dottie.

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.300
I didn't know that.

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:17.300
Um, I blue beam, at least in my experience has been used by people I know who want to

02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:19.300
discount, um, UFOs.

02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:24.300
And I know in that comment, I said, like, I could understand, uh, the utilizing of a

02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:29.300
invasion for fear, but I still think that that is mainly based off of Reagan's Reagan

02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:31.300
speech and, uh, disinformation.

02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:34.300
If skinny Bob is faked is incredibly well done.

02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:36.300
When I met them, they looked just like that.

02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:37.300
Interesting.

02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:39.300
Convincing for so long.

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:40.300
That's a good point.

02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:44.300
It could only be, uh, it could only be for convincing as long as the holograms could, could

02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:46.300
stay up in the, in the air.

02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:52.300
Um, maybe, uh, the weird after effects on skinny Bob.

02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:55.300
I've heard of those.

02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:59.300
It was any Jacobson that said the Roswell crash was rushing towards and Dottie to an

02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:00.300
unacknowledged of Greer.

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:05.300
But I think, uh, uh, any Jacobson said that recently on her Sean Ryan appearance, I think

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:09.300
it was, and she was on, uh, Jerry, Jonathan Reed footage.

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:14.300
Uh, listen, I heard of Jonathan Reed a long time ago on mysterious universe.

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:17.300
If you guys know, uh, that podcast, it's great.

02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:21.300
And his story was, I think a lot of, I almost posited.

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:24.300
This is Jonathan Reed story because of the NHI body.

02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:28.300
Jonathan Reed claims to have a, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, because if I am, I'll retract

02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:29.300
my statement right away.

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:34.300
But Jonathan Reed claims to have slain a, uh, a, a creature that, that creature he has

02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:36.300
photographed with a samurai sword.

02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:39.300
I believe that's what he said and then put it on nice.

02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:46.300
Uh, and also the photos of the wedge shaped craft are very weirdly proportioned, very

02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:48.300
weirdly proportioned.

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:51.300
Uh, so many good videos ruined with crap editing.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.300
Yeah.

02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.300
I tend to agree.

02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:55.300
I tend to agree.

02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:59.300
I held Roswell foil to it heats when flame took the same as cutting metal holding the

02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.300
hand.

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:01.300
You held Roswell material.

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.300
I would like to hear, I would like to hear more about that.

02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:07.300
What's the best thing I ate at a gas station in Norway and did you get it?

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:11.300
Or what's the best thing you ate in Norway and did you eat at a gas station for all my

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.300
Norwegians out there?

02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:14.300
You will know what a hot dog on Lumpa is.

02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:19.300
And that's like a Norwegian bread tortilla that gas stations, but hot dogs on it.

02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:20.300
And then they're so good.

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.300
They're amazing.

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:24.300
They are amazing.

02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:27.300
Also wanted to tell you about two picks of alleged dead aliens I saw.

02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:30.800
They reminded me of one from EBEs described in the MJ 12 manual, the non gray ones will

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:31.800
send them on discord.

02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.300
I would love to, I would excuse me.

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:35.300
I would love to see that please.

02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:39.300
Did you see the video of the UFO in orbit that gets shot up by some weapon?

02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:40.300
Yeah.

02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:41.300
Like the kind of like light beam.

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.300
Yes, I have seen that.

02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:46.300
And I don't know what to make of it because I haven't spent too much time looking at it.

02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:50.300
I think it was, it was in not lost century.

02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:52.300
Was it in unacknowledged?

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:56.300
Take a look at UAP Gerb's eyes.

02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.300
He is a Pleiadian alien.

02:12:58.300 --> 02:12:59.300
That'd be cool, man.

02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:00.300
I wish I was.

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:05.300
If I was, I'd be the first to tell you, but I am just a human.

02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:07.300
I would like to see the original skinny Bob video.

02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:09.300
I wonder where that has obviously been cropped down.

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:14.300
I would like to as well, but it with a, with those videos, this just, at least for me,

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.300
I couldn't come to a conclusion.

02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:19.300
So it'd be difficult for me to engage thoughts on the tall whites.

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.300
Very interesting to me.

02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:25.300
I'm still trying to start out what the heck kind of the graves or the small creatures,

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:27.300
the EBE type ones and twos are.

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:32.300
And then we will get to the kind of description of the mantis type beings or the tall, tall

02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:35.300
graves or venusians and so forth.

02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:39.300
The problem with new wave of UFO experts is they don't understand the science of free

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:40.300
energy, anti-gravity.

02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:41.300
They could easily be deceived.

02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:43.300
Any saucer that attacks us would be considered ET.

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:50.300
I do agree that a lot of new wave UFO folks don't necessarily understand the physics

02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:52.300
behind UAP and kind of ARV.

02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:53.300
I certainly don't.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:57.300
I'll be the first to admit that physics is never, never my strong suit.

02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:59.300
The book identifies companies and crafts still secret.

02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:05.300
Bob Dean had the book in foil 1988 England.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:08.300
I think the whole bad abduction versus good abduction experience is similar to having good

02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:09.300
versus bad trips on psychedelics.

02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:13.300
That's an, that is an interesting point.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:17.300
I believe most abductions in beds are most likely sleep paralysis.

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:19.300
I have heard this too.

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:23.300
Again, I like, I don't want to discount anyone's abduction experience.

02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:28.300
So I don't know what the heck to think, but they very well could be sleep paralysis.

02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:30.300
Las Vegas alien video.

02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:33.300
I don't think anything ever came of that.

02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:34.300
Right.

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:42.300
I think Steven Dean or Steven donor on Twitter said he had was interviewing the person who

02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:43.300
took that footage.

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:44.300
Right.

02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.300
But I don't think anything ever came of that.

02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:50.300
If I'm, if I'm remembering correctly, I stayed far away from that in the Miami mall stuff.

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:55.300
Um, just wasn't not, not the sort of case I, I'd be investigating world of the world's

02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:58.300
movie is similar to the event where people were attacked and have blood drawn.

02:14:58.300 --> 02:14:59.300
Yeah.

02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:03.300
The world of the world's the Tom Cruise version that came out in 2005 scared the crap out of

02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:05.300
me as a little kid that scared me so bad.

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:08.300
What's the best publicly available UFO video you've seen?

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:13.300
Um, that's a tough one just because I've kind of moved so far away from videos.

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:17.300
I'd say right now it's probably the video of the, the triangle I always post.

02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:20.300
I can't remember exactly where that video was taken, but late at night triangle with

02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:24.300
three points of light on each vertex with one red light in the middle.

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:26.300
I think that's a fantastic video.

02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:28.300
Fantastic.

02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:30.300
The whole invasion.

02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:31.300
Yeah.

02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:32.300
I agree with this.

02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:36.300
I've said this before that the only, uh, blue beam claims are to point to, uh, to Reagan

02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:40.300
speech when he addressed the UN and said, I can't think of how quickly, uh, the world

02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:43.300
would come together with the threat of an alien invasion.

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:44.300
Yeah.

02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:45.300
Okay.

02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:48.300
So this is with, uh, Jonathan Reed and the samurai sword.

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.300
Yeah.

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:53.300
That's been conveniently left out with a read story of a wedge kind of coming back and

02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:57.300
being popular with, with loose book in the description of the wedge shaped craft.

02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:01.300
He did say he sl, he slayed the, the creature with a samurai sword.

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:02.300
Reply to abduction comment.

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:06.300
You can go on board the craft by a telepathic mind link via unseen plane of existence out

02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:07.300
of body consciousness.

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.300
The same way ETs talk to people telepathically with the utilization of P three assets.

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:12.300
I wouldn't be surprised.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:16.300
He used a big branch.

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:17.300
Ah, okay.

02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:21.300
Maybe I was wrong about the sword, but he still slayed it with a club.

02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:23.300
Still slayed it with a club.

02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:26.300
Do I think I would look at some of John max abduction cases?

02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:27.300
Absolutely.

02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.300
I'd like to tackle the abduction phenomena.

02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:30.300
It's just, there's so much to do.

02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:34.300
So I really need to make sure we get in at a good time to, to focus fully on the abduction

02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:35.300
phenomena.

02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:38.300
The read teleportation video is whack, big whack.

02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.300
Yeah.

02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:42.300
I've seen it and I'll watch it again and I'll keep watching it, but there's a little whack.

02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:46.300
Project blue beam was not made by Dodie and disinfo usaps won't just use holograms.

02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:47.300
They'll use ARVs PLC.

02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:51.300
I think, yeah, this is, this is what a career would state, right?

02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:57.300
Especially with, with this TE or ET, I can't quite remember and the fake, the PLF abduction

02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:01.300
he occurred when he left the Nellis retrieval team.

02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:06.300
Chevrolet being locking Martin naps built a cannabis and blue book wonder if Hitler had

02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:07.300
them before the reverse engineering.

02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.300
I don't know.

02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:14.300
I had a, a good friend asked me earlier about a kind of Nazis and UAP reverse engineering.

02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:18.300
And besides hunt for his zero point and the stories of deep lock, I really haven't spent

02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.300
too much time, too much time researching.

02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:22.300
Well, Grush's op-ed come out this year.

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:23.300
I truly hope so.

02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:25.300
I truly hope so.

02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:27.300
Will it be, is it still stuck in Dobser?

02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:28.300
I'm not quite sure.

02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:31.300
Now Grush is definitely not, not being lazy.

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:37.300
I definitely think he is doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but I truly hope so.

02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:41.300
If the teleportation video didn't exist, the alien body would have to be significantly

02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:42.300
more credible.

02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:44.300
Unfortunately, dude decided to write a weird hype train to nowhere.

02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:45.300
Yes.

02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:49.300
Have you seen the Sentinel Arizona footage recorded by Nick Williams?

02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:53.300
I don't think so, but I would like to see that.

02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:57.300
That was a ET UFO being shot with scalar waves and EM system weapons.

02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:59.300
That's the situation for almost a century.

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:00.300
Yes.

02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:01.300
I have, I have heard that as well.

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:08.300
And I'm, I'm coming to start to really, really seriously research that topic of, of scalar

02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:12.300
weapons and kind of what Greer sets about targeting craft.

02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:14.300
Plasma propulsion, MHD plasma.

02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:18.300
If I'm being correct, I think Oak Shannon has some notes on this that operate in like

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:22.300
the 3.5 gigahertz range, creates a cloud, which they use as camouflage and to cool down

02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.300
the craft.

02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:30.300
Now what I have heard is that early types of ARVs used MHD Plasma Stopper Pulsion when

02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:34.300
later configurations have used actual like anti-gravity techniques.

02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:37.300
Do I have anything to back that up or any evidence or research that?

02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:39.300
No, but I've heard that before.

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:45.300
MH370, I think we'll probably stay away from, from MH370 on the channel.

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:50.300
I think it's just a, it's very toxic, toxic subject at the moment.

02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:51.300
Oh yeah.

02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:55.300
Reed stated his dog was turned to ash.

02:18:55.300 --> 02:19:01.300
That also reminds me of the 1950s Maori incident where I think a saucer discharged material.

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:05.300
I can't remember if that case was labeled as a hoax or not or found to be, but where

02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:08.300
material allegedly hit a dog.

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:11.300
Any update on Jesse, you and Jesse Michaels collaborating.

02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:14.300
I will be meeting Jesse tomorrow or Tuesday.

02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:20.300
I'm not quite sure which day yet and I will have an update then.

02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:22.300
What about the phenomena?

02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:27.300
Would you like to research the most aside from UAP, psionics, remote viewing?

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:34.300
So that's tough because crash retrieval and reverse engineering are what I like the most.

02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:39.300
At this point, I'd probably like to go down and I'll say, I'll throw in ARVs.

02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:42.300
I can't throw ARVs in there as well because I want to research that.

02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:47.300
And I'll, I'll take, I want to research dumps, deep underground military bases.

02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:51.300
Oh, that green footage, but that footage is really cool too with the triangle scene

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:53.300
from almost kind of height level.

02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:57.300
Yeah, that's a great, that's a, that's like a great video.

02:19:57.300 --> 02:20:03.300
But you remember, there's like a ball of light in the middle that I think expands.

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:07.300
And like, I think I'm, I think that's the video you're talking about.

02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:09.300
Let me know if, let me know if I'm right here.

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:12.300
I could be wrong, but I think that's the video you're talking about, the green one.

02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:16.300
Trying to get my GF into the subject and watch the first minute black last night had some interesting themes in it.

02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:18.300
The first minute black is a fantastic film.

02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:20.300
I really want to rewatch that with the lady.

02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:22.300
It's a fantastic film.

02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:25.300
And guys, I'll get through these questions maybe in about 10 minutes.

02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:27.300
I'll have to hop off, but we'll get through all of these.

02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:32.300
I promise meeting Bob Dean and after holding Roswell foil and saw pages of a few pages of blue.

02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:34.300
But remember who has gone for 20 years.

02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:35.300
The foil stretches like a razor.

02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:36.300
I cut myself.

02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:37.300
I don't remember that.

02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:42.300
Now I'd like to hear how, how did you get your hands on, on, on said foil?

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:47.300
And what have there been research done on this specific, specific piece you held?

02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:48.300
What's up, Zach?

02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:49.300
How you doing rewatch?

02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:50.300
Yes.

02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:52.300
I highly recommend starting from beginning right now.

02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:57.300
We're just chatting answering questions, but earlier we, we went through the entire gray or talk today.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.300
I bought the pay-per-view.

02:20:58.300 --> 02:20:59.300
So you didn't have to.

02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:05.300
And we kind of, I took screenshots of every single PowerPoint slide and we went through the whole dang thing.

02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:07.300
The whole thing.

02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:09.300
Have you watched the recent weaponized with Corbel?

02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:14.300
They discussed an event in 2000 where people were attacked by UFOs that took blood from them and shine beams.

02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.300
That's not the color.

02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.300
That's not the Brazil instead.

02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:17.300
Right.

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:21.300
I haven't listened to weaponized in a while, but I would like to listen to that.

02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:22.300
That's Brazil.

02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:23.300
Correct.

02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:24.300
Yeah.

02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:29.300
I haven't, I don't think since the start of the year I've listened and listened to weaponized.

02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:30.300
Oh, the turkey video.

02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:31.300
Yeah.

02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:37.300
With Chris Leto back in the day, did a great video actually like identifying the angle at

02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:40.300
which this video was recorded, the position where it was recorded.

02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:41.300
I highly recommend checking that out.

02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:43.300
It's an old Chris Leto video.

02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:47.300
I think from early 2023 mid 2023, it's fantastic.

02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.300
Are they among us like big low suggests?

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:50.300
Quite possibly.

02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:54.300
Do I have any research or evidence to back that up or have an informed opinion?

02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:55.300
No.

02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:59.300
Do not do a video on the clock.

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.300
I'd like to, of course it, uh, the clock.

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:05.300
There's a lot of relation to the Kecksburg case in terms of general design.

02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:09.300
I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to include that in the Kecksburg case or make

02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:13.300
a video on its own about the Glock.

02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:16.300
We met photons and radiation, uh, probably into the stratosphere.

02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:18.300
Craft would redirect the brain waves.

02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:19.300
Possibly.

02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:20.300
Sentinel footage.

02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:22.300
Um, Chloris Brazil.

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:23.300
Yeah.

02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:24.300
Okay.

02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:25.300
Okay.

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.300
Yeah.

02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:27.300
Yeah.

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:28.300
Yeah.

02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:29.300
Yeah.

02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:30.300
I was thinking the same thing, the Chloris Brazil incident.

02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:31.300
And I think that, uh, I got popular again because Lou spoke about it in his book.

02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:32.300
Right.

02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:33.300
Um, was it Lou?

02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:34.300
I believe so.

02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:35.300
It's a great movie.

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:37.300
MIB one, especially when the face opens and the little alien is revealed.

02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:38.300
Yeah.

02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:39.300
That's a classic.

02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:40.300
The tiny little alien MIB ones.

02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:41.300
Great.

02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:44.300
It scared me really bad when I was a child though.

02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:48.300
Jacques Valet and forbidden science for, um, has secured a document confirming the CIA

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:51.300
performed fake alien abductions in Argentina and Brazil for psychological work.

02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.300
I would really like to see this document if you have that.

02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:54.300
I've, I've never seen it.

02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:56.300
Um, I'll put the discord link in here again.

02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:59.300
I know I'll put it twice, but I would actually really like to read that document.

02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:00.300
Please.

02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:02.300
If you have it on hand, otherwise I have a copy of forbidden science for it.

02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:03.300
I'll just find it.

02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:08.300
They must see in UV light reaction times more like it.

02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:09.300
Let's see.

02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:10.300
They're seen.

02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:13.300
Let's see.

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:16.800
What are the consequences of the Collins elite are correct in their findings and the phenomenon

02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:18.740
is largely your entirely demonic.

02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:21.060
The consequences of that are just awful.

02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:27.180
That means we, uh, that mean, I don't even want to face the, the, the consequences of

02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:29.340
the UAP phenomenon being a demonic.

02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:36.340
That is almost too terrifying for a man like myself to think about, but very, very bad consequences.

02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:40.840
If that's the truth, David favor said that he was part of a big upcoming UFO documentary,

02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:41.840
not James Fox's.

02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:43.340
I have heard that supposedly coming out soon.

02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:44.340
And he said it was very interesting.

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.640
There was some podcasts with Ryan graves.

02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:46.640
I heard that as well.

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:48.740
There's also a Bob Lazar documentary coming out.

02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:50.940
Of course the program with James Fox is coming out.

02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:55.580
I think everybody in their grandmother is looking forward to that one and Jesse Michaels saw

02:23:55.580 --> 02:23:56.740
it.

02:23:56.740 --> 02:24:02.440
So if Jesse Michaels can give me any deets, I can share with you guys, I absolutely will.

02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:05.140
Maybe an ongoing YouTube playlist of the best craft videos people have ever captured would

02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:06.140
be a cool thing.

02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:07.140
That would be cool.

02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:08.140
Yeah.

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:10.980
Actually, cause I know I include a lot of craft sightings as B role, but like a full video

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:11.980
would be great.

02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:14.440
I've seen a triangle UAP it's he man made.

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:17.640
What signified that I would actually like to hear that.

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:19.940
Do I watch UAP content or only research it for YouTube?

02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:22.180
I do not really watch.

02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:23.180
Here's the thing.

02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:26.720
I don't watch UAP content because I'm always reading a UAP book.

02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:32.460
Every second of every night and day doing the UAP book or just taking a endless amount

02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:38.080
of notes on on a sightings or projects I'm working on.

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:40.140
So it's I need a little bit of a break at that time.

02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:41.880
So I don't consume too much UAP content.

02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:47.520
I'll I'll watch YouTube for for dumb stuff like maybe some games or stuff like that.

02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:51.160
I was at my friend's house after school and Bob Dean was a friend of his.

02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:52.160
Wow.

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:53.160
That's incredible.

02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:54.160
That's very cool.

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.160
Yo, what up JC?

02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:59.200
What up, dude?

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:03.640
There are metamaterials which go through plasma excitation become room temp semiconductors

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:05.200
on a quantum scale and defy gravity.

02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.920
I'll join discord and send some links.

02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:07.920
Please do.

02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:08.920
I'd like to learn more.

02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:09.920
If you can help teach me.

02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:10.920
Absolutely.

02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:11.920
Please.

02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.720
I'd like to learn and if you're willing to help please William.

02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.720
What's up, dude?

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:16.720
You made my day for showing up.

02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:17.720
Thanks, man.

02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:18.720
Christian Morales.

02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.720
You missed quite a bit.

02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:23.640
I would highly recommend going back to the very beginning of the video because for the

02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:29.600
first hour and 20 minutes we talked solely about Greer's presentation today in London.

02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.040
I took screenshots of everything and we discussed everything in it.

02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:34.800
So there's a lot there to look at.

02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:36.800
Gryffindor Beatles.

02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:40.400
There's one of it doing 900 miles and our people might be real sciences.

02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:41.400
Interesting.

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:43.760
Cows would call us demonic, right?

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.760
Probably.

02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:45.760
Yes.

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:51.920
Why do you think Lula as honest as Big Lowe is an American hero when it seems to me he

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:54.560
is doing the exact same thing as the legacy program.

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.680
Specifically he takes in all the info and uses it for wealth.

02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:58.600
Yeah, that's true, especially with Kona Blue.

02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:02.880
Who knows if Big Lowe Aerospace was actually going to share the materials it was supposed

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:06.920
to receive from Lockheed Martin.

02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:07.920
I don't know why.

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:13.000
Some of the stuff with the TTSA crew is a little strange to me, especially Big Lowe Aerospace.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.280
You guys know how Greer gets shepherded by Rand Pandolfi?

02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.800
I do not and I would like to hear.

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:28.760
Have you ever considered seismic data to quantify triangulate known crash sites?

02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:32.800
I have your research, Mr. Floyd, but I have not gone through that yet, but I think that's

02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.920
a very good route to go down.

02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:39.320
I know the current case I'm working on, Kecksburg, has recorded seismic data.

02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:43.000
I don't have the actual data, but it was referenced in the Blue Book report on the case.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.920
So I actually think that's very worthwhile.

02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.840
That's a great research avenue.

02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:50.280
Project Gravitar should be entertaining, aesthetically pleasing if nothing else.

02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:55.880
This is the Badozzar documentary with a full VR recreation of the sports model to explore

02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:57.880
digitally, which is awesome.

02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:59.720
That's going to be really cool.

02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:02.920
At what age did you get hooked on the UFO topic and why, since I could read?

02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:07.880
I've said this a lot, but ever since I was able to read, I had some UFO sightings books

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:10.080
specifically mentioned of Betty and Barney Hill.

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:15.760
I remember reading about that case from a very young age, and I've just always been incredibly

02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.960
fascinated with the phenomenon.

02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:23.040
Okay, we'll get through these and then in a couple of minutes we'll hit the road gang,

02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:26.080
headed to the weird desk after Kit Green, Pandolfi is dangerous and has imitated and

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.240
scared a lot of people.

02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:30.600
He shepherds Greer because Greer is so controversial, it helps the gatekeepers.

02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:31.600
Interesting.

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.320
I'll have to do some more research on that, absolutely.

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.280
One thing that stumps me about the whole triangle being man-made Arabies, why TF are they flying

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:42.320
them at Low Altitude or Highway so everyone can see it makes no sense?

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.880
Yes, that's actually a great question.

02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:48.160
So many people who talk about having triangle sightings talk about these being observed

02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:52.320
over such low altitudes, hundreds of feet.

02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:55.040
In the interest of not wanting to be seen, that seems very strange.

02:27:55.040 --> 02:28:00.760
It's also strange how triangular sightings don't really pop up until the 1950s.

02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:08.440
Bob Lazar said the sports model is a Hanoubi MK4, the fastest craft, Lazar don't say Hanoubi.

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.640
I didn't know that.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:11.880
What do you think of the new Aero director?

02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:13.400
I know he's in league with Jay Stratton.

02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:21.200
I know he also made some rather silly comments on LinkedIn as his first act of Aero director.

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:22.880
With Aero, we're not going to get anything different.

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:26.960
It's going to be more of the same, probably.

02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:30.000
Gerb said that if the Trump wins, he will release good picks of UFOs.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.120
I know he said that, but is he going to be able to declassify them?

02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:37.840
Chris Mellon, David Grosh, Lousano have all talked about 4K UFO footage presumably taken

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.040
from the NRO that is classified and will not be released.

02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:45.520
I definitely take that with a grain of salt, but I would love that.

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.920
Will I ever make a video about the UFO in your profile picture?

02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:50.360
Yes, the Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Saucer sightings?

02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:51.360
Yes, I would.

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:57.040
That's probably the one photo set I'd make a video on, just because it's so fascinating.

02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.160
Big Lowe seems like he hardly cares about disclosure, he has a ton of info, but doesn't

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:01.160
care to reveal what it is.

02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:02.160
I agree.

02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:08.960
He seems to be more just doing consciousness after death studies and more passion projects.

02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:11.440
He doesn't seem well vested in disclosure.

02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.040
Magic Book was MI5 and MI6.IF.

02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:18.240
Does everything go to Royal Air Force bases too?

02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:19.240
I don't know.

02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:21.240
That's actually a good question.

02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:24.880
Besides the witness we talked about in Greer's stuff earlier, BK, I'm actually not familiar

02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:30.960
with any UK bases that might be a place in which crash retrievals, biologics maybe, store

02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.760
it.

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:36.800
I got hooked on the UFO subject when I seen three UFOs flying doing strange maneuvers

02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.480
in Lithuania in the early 2000s.

02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:39.480
Love the content, keep it up.

02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:40.480
Thank you, man.

02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:41.480
Thank you very much.

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:42.400
Three UFOs doing strange maneuvers.

02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:43.400
What kind of maneuvers?

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:45.640
That sounds fascinating.

02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:46.640
Opinions on Green Street.

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.360
We talked about this earlier, and I think I probably talk about this every episode.

02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:55.720
I think he has some sort of Department of Defense Pentagon ties.

02:29:55.720 --> 02:30:00.360
He also seems like a guy who got burned that is trying to take revenge on UFO players.

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:06.960
There's something to be said about the fact he includes the phrase spooky alien space monsters

02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:09.120
and 8 out of 10 tweets he does.

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.120
I'm not the biggest fan of Green Street.

02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.360
Before 2017, Greer used to always say that one day they'll do a fake disclosure.

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:21.360
They'll start saying UFOs are a threat happening in 2017, happening now in another coincidence.

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:26.160
This probably parallels with the fact that Greer has a huge beef with Lou, which we talked

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.920
about a little bit earlier, but yeah, those are probably direct connections.

02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:37.360
Tier 3B triangular, but around Hanubi would glow triangle balls with a cube to steer magnets.

02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:43.360
Interesting, cube, sort of like the cube within a sphere like Greer speaks about.

02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:48.000
A president has no power to bring disclosure because of the Atomic Energy Act.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:53.520
The app trans classified as foreign nuclear materials, and there's an Obama classification.

02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.320
I can't remember what classification.

02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:58.840
Executive order, I can't remember what it was called.

02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:03.720
I'll post it in the Discord, but that there's a mandatory aversion to declassification

02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:09.520
with anything dealing with non-human technologies, which could reference NHI or AI or both.

02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:12.720
Bigelow isn't about disclosure, but he's seen some disturbing stuff.

02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:15.880
Man, his wife was allegedly killed to the hitchhiker effect.

02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:19.120
Interesting, I have not pursued his wife's death.

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:20.560
That is really interesting.

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:22.680
Yeah, the same.

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:23.480
I had no idea.

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:27.120
I've seen the moon disappear and pop up in a different place.

02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:28.120
That is interesting.

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:30.080
Here's the link.

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:30.840
Okay, thank you.

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:32.760
I'll check that out, my man.

02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:44.680
My step-granddad posted Magic 12 to MJ12 in the 90s, but book was all black inked.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:52.760
So your granddad had in hands a Magic 12 book, but that was heavily redacted.

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:53.560
That is interesting.

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:54.440
I would like to hear more.

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.600
You should check out Soccer 96.

02:31:57.600 --> 02:31:59.840
They're super into the topic and have a track with Salami Rose.

02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:01.800
Absolutely, that sounds great.

02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:05.160
Anybody I can look into more.

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:08.120
Guys, at this point, we will take some time to sign off.

02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:10.000
We've been doing this for about two and a half hours.

02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:15.160
Like I said, we'll be doing a stream of just about every Sunday, maybe every Monday.

02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:18.720
Whenever there's a big event like this, Greer stuff, I will always kind of use the

02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:23.680
live to cover it, do that for a video for a live instead of just kind of research

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:27.000
because I like my videos to be huge research projects.

02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:32.080
And with that, guys, yeah, with that big low statement about his wife, if anybody's

02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:34.400
in the Discord, we'll continue to talk about it there.

02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:37.480
With that, guys, I want to say I really appreciate the support on the channel.

02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:40.640
Thank you guys so much for showing up, watching this to our live stream.

02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:44.760
I know Kai, I know something or someone have kind of been here since the very start.

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:49.840
So I really appreciate everyone being here and expect a new video this week.

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:51.000
I'm hoping to get it done.

02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:54.320
I was hoping to get it done today, but it might be Wednesday.

02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:57.120
We get it out just because it got some stuff going on with Jesse.

02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:58.880
It's going to be a bit of a busy week.

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:01.640
So we'll get that video out and then some some other stuff in the work.

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:05.280
Thank you guys all so much for showing up to the stream and I will catch everybody later.

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:06.480
All right, see you guys.
