00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
With something that stuck out so well, it's always going to be basically imprisoned in

00:04.600 --> 00:07.680
my mind for the rest of my life, and it has been for 14 years.

00:07.680 --> 00:15.760
You look down into the valley, and there's a clearing with a UAP just sitting there.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.760
Sitting there rotating clockwise, and that's in transition this color spectrum, I was telling

00:19.760 --> 00:20.760
you too.

00:20.760 --> 00:25.320
So as far as from a distance, yes, that looks very accurate to what I saw.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.360
Rogue military force, if you will.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.280
The most concerning thing about this is they all had American dialects.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.640
They had American gear.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.000
They had OTVs, black, they had black camouflage.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.280
They had very similar setups to what we had, but more high speed, something what you would

00:39.280 --> 00:42.840
see special operation groups these days have.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.080
They had no insignias on.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.800
And that's what I thought it was it.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.760
I thought they were going to smoke us, you know, and they kept saying that, you know,

00:48.760 --> 00:51.760
we can kill you right now, you know, as this is.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.840
At the start of the year, I made a video titled The Marines Who Got Too Close to UFOs, where

00:56.840 --> 01:01.440
I talked about two whistleblower testimonies of men who encountered UAP throughout their

01:01.440 --> 01:04.320
military service in the USMC.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.880
And this included Jonathan Wagan, and of course, Michael Herrera.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.200
And guys, I'll admit my biases.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.720
While I was really supportive of Jonathan Wagan and found his story to be credible, I was

01:15.720 --> 01:18.120
really dismissive of Herrera.

01:18.120 --> 01:22.120
Now for Michael Herrera, I'm torn on his story.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.360
I just I'm not sure about that.

01:25.360 --> 01:30.440
This all changed when Redditor and now my good friend, Joey is not my name, reached out to

01:30.440 --> 01:34.280
me and asked if I was the creator of this video.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.400
Joey told me that he had been investigating Michael deeply and that he and him had actually

01:38.400 --> 01:41.120
established a relationship and talked weekly.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.880
I even left a paper trail with certain people, including Joey is not my name.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.360
And there's been a person who has helped with that, Joey, that's not my name.

01:50.360 --> 01:55.520
If you're watching this, thank you for your help as more of a person who has broad attention

01:55.520 --> 01:58.600
to detail in a lot of things, which is remarkable.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.680
His Reddit handle is Joey is not my name.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.000
And finally, he told me that he had enough evidence to attest to the fact that Michael

02:07.000 --> 02:12.200
met a man, an insider in the black reverse engineering program.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.920
This brief exchange messages led to a fast friendship between Joey and myself.

02:16.920 --> 02:22.400
And for months, actually, he and I have been talking every day on messaging, video calls

02:22.400 --> 02:25.640
and phone calls discussing Michael's case.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.880
And throughout this time, he has shown me some of the astonishing evidence to both support

02:29.880 --> 02:36.920
Michael's claims of his experience in Indonesia and his experience meeting an insider in the

02:36.920 --> 02:39.120
black reverse engineering programs.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.600
So today, guys, I am thrilled to tell you that I actually have my good friend, Joey is not

02:43.600 --> 02:48.440
my name on the show, to talk about his experience investigating Herrera's case and discuss some

02:48.440 --> 02:52.200
of the evidence he's actually found to corroborate Michael.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.440
If you've never heard of Michael Herrera, I'd be shocked, especially after so much

02:56.440 --> 03:01.760
renewed interest in his encounter, after being all but named in the abomination that is the

03:01.760 --> 03:04.440
Arrow Historical Report Volume 1.

03:04.440 --> 03:09.080
But for those of you who don't know, or may need a quick refresher, let's briefly summarize

03:09.080 --> 03:11.840
Michael's UFO whistleblower encounter.

03:11.840 --> 03:17.080
And guys, please note, as I talk about Michael's testimony, I will be recounting it as fact,

03:17.080 --> 03:18.520
as told by Michael.

03:18.520 --> 03:24.000
The reality is, there is still no way we can prove with evidence that Michael encountered

03:24.000 --> 03:26.840
this UFO in the jungles of Indonesia.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.520
But we can prove with fact some of the context around Michael's story, such as the military

03:31.520 --> 03:36.320
mission in Indonesia and the relief effort by the USAF and Marines.

03:36.320 --> 03:42.320
In the summer of 2023, Stephen Greer's National Press Club event featured an array of whistleblower

03:42.320 --> 03:47.200
individuals, ranging from credible to somewhat dubious.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.840
One of these men was a USMC vet who seemed emboldened to break his 14-year silence, yet

03:52.840 --> 03:55.560
nervous to reveal himself to the public.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.000
It was here Michael Herrera first told his story to the world.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.160
In 2009, 2nd Battalion 5th Marine Michael Herrera, at this time a 20-year-old saw gunner,

04:06.160 --> 04:11.080
was called into Indonesia for a human relief aid mission after the devastating Sumatra

04:11.080 --> 04:13.200
earthquake in Tsunami.

04:13.200 --> 04:18.560
Michael was stationed on the USS Denver, which is oddly enough the name of both of our hometowns.

04:18.560 --> 04:24.080
This was the only ship routed to the west coast of Indonesia from the US 7th Fleet.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.600
In October of 2009, Herrera's unit was informed they would be providing security to aid in

04:29.600 --> 04:34.360
the delivery of food and medical supplies, and it's crucial to note, although humanitarian

04:34.360 --> 04:40.160
missions generally do not see soldiers equipped with weapons, the 1st Marines reportedly were,

04:40.160 --> 04:45.600
and in this case, M16A4s due to the heavy presence of terrorist training in the area.

04:45.600 --> 04:51.360
Herrera's team arrived near Pandang from CH-53 Helos at a hasty LZ, where the team

04:51.360 --> 04:56.120
pushed to a high ground for reconnaissance purposes, and it's worth noting and rightfully

04:56.120 --> 05:01.400
one of the biggest points of contention surrounding Michael's testimony, Herrera states his team

05:01.400 --> 05:07.920
was not equipped with radio comms, and Michael himself states this was highly abnormal.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.160
The team trekked up a ridge at an elevation of roughly 300 meters.

05:12.160 --> 05:18.000
Herrera had on him a Panasonic camera and was taking images of the surrounding area.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.960
Once the Marines reached the high point of the ridge, something quote, stuck out like

05:21.960 --> 05:25.900
a sore thumb, end quote, against the jungle terrain.

05:25.900 --> 05:31.220
There was a craft rotating just above the tree line, transitioning colors between a

05:31.220 --> 05:34.660
light matte gray and a dark matte black.

05:34.660 --> 05:40.020
Perplexed, the team decided to approach and investigate, and it's key to note, Michael

05:40.020 --> 05:44.300
did in fact take pictures of the craft with the camera he stored in his spent magazine

05:44.300 --> 05:45.820
pouch.

05:45.820 --> 05:50.980
Reaching down the slope, the USMC team was about 150 meters from the craft.

05:50.980 --> 05:55.780
It was from here Michael estimated the craft to be 300 feet in diameter.

05:55.780 --> 06:02.660
It was octagonal in shape, rotating clockwise with Vantablack exterior panels and a pyramid

06:02.660 --> 06:04.300
type shape on top.

06:04.300 --> 06:24.460
The craft let off an audible hum, almost like a guitar amp.

06:24.460 --> 06:31.700
The craft floated 15-20 feet above the ground, surrounded by a quote, rogue military force.

06:31.700 --> 06:37.620
What was astounding is these men featured American dialects, American gear, and similar

06:37.620 --> 06:41.240
setups the Marines had but with much better equipment.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.540
These men had no rank, no insignia.

06:44.540 --> 06:48.340
Eight of the men engaged the Marines, directing their weapons at the soldiers and flipping

06:48.340 --> 06:53.500
off the weapon safeties, screaming at the Marines, asking what they were doing there,

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
and threatening their lives.

06:55.500 --> 07:00.500
Terrified the Marines complied, they were padded down and stripped of their weapons.

07:00.500 --> 07:05.980
The rogue operators even knew to take the Marines military IDs out of their left breast

07:05.980 --> 07:11.780
pocket, where they snapped pictures of Herrera and his fellow Marines identifications.

07:11.780 --> 07:16.900
During this time, Michael occasionally shifted his glance back to the large UFO, where four

07:16.900 --> 07:22.780
F-350s sat with weapon cases and containers with an oxygen or humidity control unit which

07:22.780 --> 07:27.940
held what Michael would later come to learn were human beings.

07:27.940 --> 07:32.060
The F-350s loaded the supplies onto a platform below the craft.

07:32.060 --> 07:37.900
When the platform itself rose from the ground, connected with the craft, and the two connected

07:37.900 --> 07:46.500
pieces shot off westward instantaneously, no rotor wash, no exhaust, no sonic boom, none

07:46.500 --> 07:49.900
of the surrounding vegetation was disturbed in any way.

07:49.900 --> 07:54.460
When Marines were told to turn around, Michael thought that this was it, they were dead.

07:54.460 --> 07:59.900
Until the operators began reloading the soldiers' equipment and magazines back onto their persons.

07:59.900 --> 08:03.860
Escorting the Marines back up to the slopes, the operators told Michael and his fellow

08:03.860 --> 08:10.100
soldiers they were not allowed to look back or talk about what they had seen.

08:10.100 --> 08:13.980
Breaking the hillside, the Marines ran back to the LZ, where a resident gunnery sergeant

08:13.980 --> 08:18.180
grew furious at the non-combat-effective Marines.

08:18.180 --> 08:22.780
Flying back to the USS Denver, an admiral debriefed the team, and a few days later while

08:22.780 --> 08:28.660
on leave, the battery and SD card to Michael's camera were taken, along with the fellow Marine

08:28.660 --> 08:30.420
cell phones.

08:30.420 --> 08:35.900
And finally, when the USS Denver tracked back to Okinawa, a man in use-half blues with no

08:35.900 --> 08:41.340
name tag, pulled Michael into his office, where he told him to never tell anybody of

08:41.340 --> 08:46.660
his encounter, regardless of chain of command, discussing the event would lead to imprisonment

08:46.660 --> 08:48.340
or death.

08:48.340 --> 08:54.020
Michael was then forced to sign an NDA to never speak about the experience.

08:54.020 --> 09:05.180
And what really triggered me into being motivated to look into the case myself was hearing all

09:05.180 --> 09:13.500
of the negative reaction towards him for reasons that I felt were really flimsy.

09:13.500 --> 09:21.540
People were criticizing him because he said they didn't have radios, or because he mislabeled

09:21.540 --> 09:23.540
the name of a rifle or something.

09:23.540 --> 09:31.940
And I just thought that was pretty absurd to completely dismiss a whistleblower when you're

09:31.940 --> 09:38.180
literally sitting here considering a story about a 300-foot UFO, but because they didn't

09:38.180 --> 09:43.300
have a radio, that's too unbelievable for you, so let's just dismiss the whole thing.

09:43.300 --> 09:54.300
If the UFO community did not have the open-mindedness and patience and space to provide a whistleblower

09:54.300 --> 10:02.940
to give time to investigate and vet the story, and if we were just going to shoot them down

10:02.940 --> 10:10.460
immediately for really lame reasons, how are we going to expect the general public to take

10:10.460 --> 10:15.580
this seriously if we can't even give it a chance?

10:15.580 --> 10:21.780
The other thing was it dawned on me, this is a military operation and humanitarian operation,

10:21.780 --> 10:30.940
so there's a ton of photojournalism, journalists, military reports and assessments that were

10:30.940 --> 10:33.860
done all around this operation.

10:33.860 --> 10:40.020
So I saw that as a great opportunity to begin digging into the details to see if I could

10:40.020 --> 10:45.340
find any conflicts with Michael's testimony.

10:45.340 --> 10:52.420
And I ended up finding the opposite, that I was corroborating everything that I could

10:52.420 --> 10:55.620
find corroborated what he was saying.

10:55.620 --> 11:01.900
Now obviously that doesn't prove he saw a UFO, but it does corroborate all of the details

11:01.900 --> 11:05.300
around that operation that he was on.

11:05.300 --> 11:12.500
And so I made a post on Reddit kind of detailing those things that I found.

11:12.860 --> 11:17.860
Joey's first Reddit post titled Verifying the Events Around Michael Herrera's UFO Encounter

11:17.860 --> 11:24.580
Part 1, saw to confirm all the little bits and pieces of the military operation in 2009.

11:24.580 --> 11:29.900
Logically, if Michael could be found to be lying about any detail regarding the humanitarian

11:29.900 --> 11:36.180
mission, his whole testimony could be thrown out the window as, another UFO want to be.

11:36.180 --> 11:42.140
Joey provided documentable evidence to support all of the context Michael provided including,

11:42.140 --> 11:47.820
the USS Denver was the sole ship assigned to support Indonesian military efforts, regardless

11:47.820 --> 11:50.300
of Michael finding this strange.

11:50.300 --> 11:55.340
The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit was present at this operation.

11:55.340 --> 11:59.740
CH-53 Super Stallion choppers were used to deliver aid.

11:59.740 --> 12:05.620
And finally, the confirmation of hasty LZs, threw a blog post which detailed efforts done

12:05.620 --> 12:10.220
by the US forces to deliver supplies to critical and remote areas.

12:10.220 --> 12:15.260
Of course, none of this actually proves that Michael saw a UFO lost in service, but this

12:15.260 --> 12:20.580
post does confirm key smaller elements of his story, including accurately depicting the

12:20.580 --> 12:22.940
military op in Indonesia.

12:22.940 --> 12:28.140
Joey includes a call to action asking Michael to reach out for further investigation.

12:28.140 --> 12:36.780
So my plan was to do a part two where I would, I wanted to figure out where the landing zone

12:36.780 --> 12:37.780
was.

12:37.780 --> 12:43.020
I thought if I could reach out to Michael and we could work together to figure out where

12:43.020 --> 12:45.900
the landing zone was, I have the 3D modeling background.

12:45.900 --> 12:52.420
So what I wanted to do was import that terrain into, you know, some 3D modeling software

12:52.420 --> 13:00.740
and be able to perform like additional analysis to cross check his estimates of distances

13:00.740 --> 13:03.700
and heights and scales of things.

13:03.700 --> 13:11.740
And I also thought it was important to illustrate the distances that are involved in this encounter

13:11.740 --> 13:18.140
because the landing zone was almost 700 or 800 meters away from where the craft was sighted

13:18.140 --> 13:22.380
with a hill in between in the middle of jungle.

13:22.380 --> 13:27.660
And so that was really my only thought for reaching out to Michael.

13:27.660 --> 13:34.140
I had no idea it was going to, you know, kind of spiral, spiral much deeper into what it

13:34.140 --> 13:35.140
has.

13:35.140 --> 13:42.580
I mean, how, how rare is it that we get any sort of testimony that isn't, that's literally

13:42.580 --> 13:46.100
just it, you know, most times it's literally just testimony.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.980
It's just someone's verbal account of what happened.

13:48.980 --> 13:49.980
There's no evidence.

13:49.980 --> 13:50.980
There's no nothing.

13:50.980 --> 13:58.580
So here we have a military operation that has, you know, aerial surveys being conducted.

13:58.580 --> 14:03.900
I'm sure there's plenty of satellite imagery, you know, that exists and just all of the

14:03.900 --> 14:08.220
different records that kind of track the movements of things.

14:08.220 --> 14:13.100
You know, it just that reason alone seems like a very exciting case to dig into where

14:13.100 --> 14:16.740
you have a lot of opportunity to uncover data.

14:16.740 --> 14:20.140
Literally that same day that I emailed him.

14:20.140 --> 14:21.140
He called me that night.

14:21.140 --> 14:28.300
We spoke for about a half hour and, you know, I got the sense that he respected the amount

14:28.300 --> 14:31.980
of effort I put into that post and just the, you know, just putting in the work.

14:31.980 --> 14:37.660
I have a feeling it was part of why he started to trust me and respect me moving forward.

14:37.660 --> 14:41.500
You know, he started trusting me with, with certain sensitive information that, that did

14:41.500 --> 14:48.300
help, you know, back up some of his, some of his claims, circumstantially, I'll say.

14:48.300 --> 14:53.540
Then he started telling me more about this insider.

14:53.540 --> 14:58.460
The discussion around this program insider who met with and disclosed leaks to Michael

14:58.460 --> 15:03.860
is where some followers of this case, including myself, justifiably raised red flags and heightened

15:03.860 --> 15:05.500
their skepticism.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.600
But who is this insider and for what reason did he meet with Michael?

15:09.600 --> 15:13.420
What can Joey tell us about this meeting and how can he prove Michael was flown out to

15:13.420 --> 15:17.020
a secure facility to meet with this shadowy figure?

15:17.020 --> 15:21.520
And also do not worry when we get to the actual contents of the meeting, we will of course

15:21.520 --> 15:25.940
discuss all of the leaks that were told to Michael by this insider.

15:25.940 --> 15:30.260
Michael's first encounter with this insider was actually mentioned on his first public

15:30.260 --> 15:35.540
appearance on Stephen Greer's national press club panel, which come to find out through

15:35.540 --> 15:40.180
recent revelations from yesterday from somebody who came forward to Dr. Greer.

15:40.180 --> 15:44.700
I don't know who they are, but what they had told him and what he has told me is that

15:44.860 --> 15:48.660
this gentleman knows exactly what these were used for because they had like a cylinder on

15:48.660 --> 15:54.300
the front, which is either for oxygen or what I have hypothesized was for vacuum sealing,

15:54.300 --> 16:00.580
which believed me to suspect that they were smuggling narcotics or drugs.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.660
Come to find out it's more disturbing than that.

16:02.660 --> 16:07.780
This gentleman has first hand account with this and says that it was for people.

16:07.780 --> 16:12.300
This insider wanted to meet Michael in person.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.860
And so he asked Dr. Greer to make the connection.

16:16.860 --> 16:22.740
And so, you know, he introduced the two or passed along phone numbers or whatever.

16:22.740 --> 16:26.140
And so Michael's telling me all this, you know, that this this insider wants to meet

16:26.140 --> 16:28.100
him and all this stuff.

16:28.100 --> 16:35.820
And I found it very suspicious, you know, I found it very strange that not only would

16:35.860 --> 16:44.420
he have this really incredible story about seeing a UFO in Indonesia, a huge 300 foot

16:44.420 --> 16:48.500
UFO, which is is pretty unique.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.500
I don't know.

16:49.500 --> 16:53.820
I personally don't know of too many stories like that that big.

16:53.820 --> 16:58.820
And now you're telling me that that literally an insider wants to meet you like, come on,

16:58.820 --> 17:04.420
this is, you know, this is pretty outrageous, you know, how did how did Michael react when

17:04.420 --> 17:05.900
he was approached by the insider?

17:05.900 --> 17:06.660
Was he excited?

17:06.660 --> 17:07.580
Was he skeptical?

17:07.580 --> 17:10.460
Was he possibly worried for his safety?

17:10.460 --> 17:17.260
Yeah, he was, he was very, he, he, I mean, the last time, if you think about it, like

17:17.260 --> 17:22.140
the last time he's interacted with any of these people, they had guns pointed at him

17:22.140 --> 17:24.140
and, you know, we're threatening to kill him and stuff.

17:24.140 --> 17:28.900
And so now here's someone, you know, allegedly associated with that.

17:28.980 --> 17:37.380
And, but he just felt like if he wants to move this forward, he's got to, he's got to

17:37.380 --> 17:39.500
take the chance and do it.

17:39.500 --> 17:49.100
And for me, you know, at the time, this was pretty early on in my interactions with Michael.

17:49.100 --> 17:54.260
And I didn't feel like I had the sort of relationship with him where I could, you know, ask

17:54.260 --> 17:57.500
questions or provide advice or anything like that.

17:57.500 --> 18:03.420
You know, I was basically just kind of respectfully, you know, taking information from him that

18:03.420 --> 18:08.380
he felt comfortable sharing with me.

18:08.380 --> 18:12.100
But I wanted to scream at him and say, dude, like, are you crazy?

18:12.100 --> 18:18.820
And mind you, I went back and forth constantly through this period where I would allow myself

18:18.820 --> 18:24.220
to pretend it's all real and like, you know, let myself just kind of sit there for a minute

18:24.220 --> 18:29.540
and be like, all right, let's say this is all real, holy crap, this is, he's crazy.

18:29.540 --> 18:33.100
Like he can't go and meet this guy, he's going to kill him, you know.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.860
And then there were times where I would be feeling the opposite and being like, okay,

18:37.860 --> 18:45.820
this is, this is clearly like a setup and he's telling me stuff that he's telling me

18:45.820 --> 18:46.820
is sensitive.

18:46.820 --> 18:51.100
But in reality, it's, he wants me to leak it, but he's telling me not to.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.980
It's like reverse psychology or something.

18:52.980 --> 18:55.580
You know, I need to be really cautious here.

18:55.580 --> 19:01.500
And so that was, that was what was going through my mind at the time and it was very much back

19:01.500 --> 19:02.660
and forth.

19:02.660 --> 19:08.220
But I also felt like I was in a pretty good position because this wasn't anything I had

19:08.220 --> 19:09.620
to take action on.

19:09.620 --> 19:13.180
I had reached out to him to kind of like try to figure out what the LZ was and then it kind

19:13.180 --> 19:16.260
of just snowballed into this other thing.

19:16.260 --> 19:22.020
But I felt like I was in a great position because there was really no risk or harm in

19:22.020 --> 19:29.660
me just letting things play out and see what happens, you know, Joey was rightfully extremely

19:29.660 --> 19:36.540
confused and skeptical as to why Michael confided so much information to him about the insider

19:36.540 --> 19:40.260
in the meeting time, date and location.

19:40.260 --> 19:45.820
It was then Joey actually realized Michael was using him as a dead man switch.

19:45.820 --> 19:51.140
Michael feared what might happen to him being taken out to an unfamiliar location by unfamiliar

19:51.140 --> 19:52.140
people.

19:52.140 --> 19:57.660
And in case he was in fact killed, Joey should release any and all information he had.

19:57.660 --> 20:03.100
That was what made me the most suspicious because it was like he was trusting me with

20:03.100 --> 20:06.700
information without any real justification.

20:06.700 --> 20:13.260
And then I realized, you know, that he was going out to meet this guy and I got the feeling

20:13.260 --> 20:17.060
that he was, you know, telling me this information in case something happened to him.

20:17.060 --> 20:23.300
And I called him out on it and told and, you know, he basically said like, yeah, I, you

20:23.300 --> 20:26.380
know, if something happens to me while I'm out there, you know, I want you to release

20:26.380 --> 20:28.300
all this information.

20:28.300 --> 20:32.340
I'm very happy that Joey brought this next point up as he has never actually talked about

20:32.340 --> 20:33.740
this publicly.

20:33.740 --> 20:38.580
The day before the meeting, Joey and Michael had a conversation about the meeting and Joey

20:38.580 --> 20:41.700
recorded this conversation without Michael's knowledge.

20:41.700 --> 20:50.860
I called Michael and had a conversation with him about the meeting and I recorded it without

20:50.860 --> 20:52.780
his knowledge.

20:52.780 --> 21:03.580
And I did that because I felt like I needed proof in case I did need to, in case something

21:03.580 --> 21:07.740
did happen to him and, and I couldn't get in touch with him and I needed to reach out

21:07.740 --> 21:12.300
to someone to prove that, yes, I'm in touch with Michael and these are the things he's

21:12.300 --> 21:14.260
told me and now I can't get ahold of him.

21:14.260 --> 21:18.500
I didn't think anyone would believe me unless I had some sort of proof that I was talking

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
to him.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
So I recorded that.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.500
I think I actually shared that with you.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.500
Hey, Michael.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
Hey, what's up?

21:25.500 --> 21:31.780
I had a little time before I have to kick off this meeting here at 9.30.

21:31.780 --> 21:32.780
Oh, okay.

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
Yeah.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.940
Well, I just, you know, first of all, wanted to check in with you to see how you're, how

21:36.940 --> 21:37.940
you're doing, how you're feeling.

21:37.940 --> 21:38.940
Good.

21:38.940 --> 21:45.460
I had a meeting with these guys so I'm kind of, you know, I'm nervous about a little apprehensive,

21:45.460 --> 21:50.420
but if this is going to get carried any further than I need to, you know, I need to speak to

21:50.420 --> 21:51.420
the horse's mouth.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.420
So speak.

21:52.420 --> 21:57.940
So I've, I just, you know, it is what it is at this point, but it's fucking crazy.

21:57.940 --> 21:58.940
Yeah.

21:58.940 --> 21:59.940
I'm, yeah.

21:59.940 --> 22:00.940
I just kind of checking in.

22:00.940 --> 22:03.740
I mean, like, geez.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.180
So everything's basically all set for the meeting.

22:06.540 --> 22:07.540
Yeah.

22:07.540 --> 22:08.540
Tomorrow for tomorrow.

22:08.540 --> 22:11.180
So, so I arrived there around a clock.

22:11.180 --> 22:12.180
Yeah.

22:12.180 --> 22:13.180
They're time.

22:13.180 --> 22:17.180
And then there's, they're picking me up with picking me up.

22:17.180 --> 22:22.420
They got a, they're putting me in and then I'm going to some, apparently there's a facility

22:22.420 --> 22:28.340
out and that they're taking me to and then like somewhere to go see some things.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.980
So I don't know what that entails, but yeah.

22:30.980 --> 22:31.980
Yeah.

22:31.980 --> 22:32.980
Okay.

22:32.980 --> 22:37.180
And then you're going to touch base with me after, afterwards at some point.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.180
Yeah.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.180
Okay.

22:39.180 --> 22:40.180
All right, Michael.

22:40.180 --> 22:41.180
Well, be safe.

22:41.180 --> 22:45.380
My friend and look forward to touching base with you when you get back.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.380
Roger that, man.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.380
Thank you for being involved with this too.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.580
And, you know, I'm glad that you're checking up on me.

22:50.580 --> 22:51.580
Cool.

22:51.580 --> 22:52.580
You know, it's great.

22:52.580 --> 22:57.100
So yeah, as soon as I get more information, if I'm able to release some things after this

22:57.100 --> 22:58.980
meeting, then I'll let you know.

22:58.980 --> 22:59.980
Okay.

22:59.980 --> 23:00.980
Sounds good.

23:00.980 --> 23:01.980
All right, buddy.

23:01.980 --> 23:02.980
Bye.

23:02.980 --> 23:09.020
What stood out to me most about this conversation was the fear in Michael's voice.

23:09.020 --> 23:13.380
He sounded scared like he didn't know what was going to happen to him.

23:13.380 --> 23:19.420
And yes, he did provide specific details and also Joey did tell Michael about this recording

23:19.420 --> 23:20.420
later on.

23:20.420 --> 23:22.100
So please don't hold that against him.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.980
Michael knows, but using this information provided by Michael, Joey was able to verify

23:26.980 --> 23:32.660
many of the details that Michael claimed, think tracking flight records and such.

23:32.660 --> 23:36.660
There's other evidence that I can't share publicly.

23:36.660 --> 23:42.500
I think I did, I did share that, like some censored, a censored version of that evidence

23:42.500 --> 23:48.540
with you and guys, I have seen a lot of people dismiss or get on Joey's case for not sharing

23:48.540 --> 23:49.860
this evidence.

23:49.860 --> 23:53.740
He has in fact shown me a censored version of this evidence.

23:53.780 --> 23:58.780
And if Joey is telling the truth, which I believe he is, and showing me an undocked

23:58.780 --> 24:03.980
version of this evidence, I can say with a high degree of certainty that this meeting

24:03.980 --> 24:05.820
did in fact take place.

24:05.820 --> 24:10.460
This isn't to say anything about what the insider showed or told Michael.

24:10.460 --> 24:15.100
I can't comment on that legitimacy nor can Joey, we don't know.

24:15.100 --> 24:19.980
The evidence, of course, is not mine to share or to an extent, even Joey's.

24:19.980 --> 24:25.980
There is a larger behind the scenes investigation here being conducted that if shared publicly

24:25.980 --> 24:30.540
could compromise the investigation, or at the very least, make it somewhat hairy.

24:30.540 --> 24:35.980
I personally hope that the finer details of this investigation and Joey's evidence will

24:35.980 --> 24:37.420
come to light soon.

24:37.420 --> 24:46.260
I essentially was able to prove that Michael was taken to a secure facility, is how I refer

24:46.260 --> 24:49.060
to it, with this insider.

24:49.140 --> 24:54.980
And so for me, and the thing is, is like, I didn't have to rely on any trust of Michael.

24:54.980 --> 24:59.460
Like I didn't have to rely, like none of this is contingent upon me having to trust any

24:59.460 --> 25:02.460
word that any person has told me.

25:02.460 --> 25:09.380
This is objective data and evidence that I used to verify this.

25:09.380 --> 25:18.860
When he got back, and we started talking, I didn't immediately reveal to him that I

25:18.860 --> 25:21.740
was able to track where he went.

25:21.740 --> 25:34.340
And so I used that opportunity to further vet and criticize, not criticize, but validate

25:34.340 --> 25:36.140
his account.

25:36.140 --> 25:41.340
So I was asking him specific questions about timing.

25:41.340 --> 25:46.620
So at this location, Michael was both shown and told things by this insider.

25:46.620 --> 25:47.820
What was he shown?

25:47.820 --> 25:50.020
He hasn't told me what he saw there.

25:50.020 --> 25:52.660
He said he he signed an NDA.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.620
So what was Michael told?

25:54.620 --> 26:00.020
Strangely enough, this insider was okay with Michael telling Joey and the greater public

26:00.020 --> 26:02.660
about what he was told at this meeting.

26:02.660 --> 26:07.820
Now, Joey and I are both a little apprehensive to discuss these points, as we cannot back

26:07.820 --> 26:11.260
these up with any evidence, however, it's important to discuss anyways.

26:11.260 --> 26:15.980
I feel a little uncomfortable like going through kind of the speculative stuff that this insider

26:15.980 --> 26:21.180
has told Michael, because it's nothing I've been able to verify.

26:21.180 --> 26:26.060
Well, according to this insider, he is an advocate for disclosure and has been in the

26:26.060 --> 26:28.220
program for decades.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.140
Remember guys, all of this is speculation.

26:31.140 --> 26:36.540
This could very well be purposeful disinformation by this insider or utter nonsense, but I want

26:36.540 --> 26:40.060
to talk about these statements due to the existence of the insider and the reality of

26:40.060 --> 26:41.060
the meeting.

26:41.060 --> 26:45.500
Fortunately, Joey has made a post on Reddit detailing this information, which will be

26:45.500 --> 26:48.140
on screen now and in the show notes.

26:48.140 --> 26:54.260
This is all content Michael has relayed publicly or given Joey permission to share.

26:54.260 --> 26:59.100
Within the USG, there are two groups studying UAP, the blue group and the black group.

26:59.100 --> 27:03.220
The blue group consists of programs with proper congressional oversight, Think, Arrow,

27:03.220 --> 27:05.380
A-Tip, Blue Book, etc.

27:05.380 --> 27:11.140
Black group is an organization founded in the 1940s to reverse engineer NHI tech.

27:11.140 --> 27:16.500
The lack of oversight, accountability and endless reach of this black group mirrors almost

27:16.500 --> 27:20.340
identically what is spoken about in the Wilson Davis memo.

27:20.340 --> 27:25.300
This black group has successfully reverse engineered NHI craft to an unknown degree

27:25.300 --> 27:29.540
of success, but utilizes these craft for operations.

27:29.540 --> 27:33.700
The flying crafts are considered, quote, boring tech.

27:33.700 --> 27:38.140
There are other technologies that are far more exciting and, in the insider's words,

27:38.140 --> 27:40.180
utilitarian for humanity.

27:40.180 --> 27:46.700
EMP-like weaponry has been developed that can target and disrupt and disable UAP.

27:46.700 --> 27:51.860
Crash retrieval programs are able to lure UAP to locations where they are disabled via

27:51.860 --> 27:56.020
the EMP weapons and craft and bodies are recovered.

27:56.020 --> 27:59.500
Now we get into some of the real woo and troubling stuff.

27:59.500 --> 28:05.820
The program recruits people with quote, psionic abilities and quote, referred to as P3, often

28:05.820 --> 28:08.220
from third world nations.

28:08.220 --> 28:13.540
These individuals are needed to interface with and control NHI tech.

28:13.540 --> 28:17.460
Recruits from these third world countries are often bargained with to join the program

28:17.460 --> 28:22.980
in exchange for security and safety of their families, likely due to the permanent or semi-permanent

28:22.980 --> 28:26.080
isolation of the recruits while in the program.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.660
This is the operation Michael stumbled upon in Indonesia.

28:29.660 --> 28:34.500
Many recruits actually die in the process of interacting with NHI tech and this is due

28:34.500 --> 28:38.020
to heavy drugging to induce a calm meditative state.

28:38.020 --> 28:41.700
These recruits are treated like biological equipment.

28:41.700 --> 28:47.340
In order to fly some interesting choice of words there, NHI craft, a consciousness connection

28:47.340 --> 28:49.180
must be made.

28:49.180 --> 28:54.300
A black program pilot cannot fly an NHI craft directly if he does not have the desired psionic

28:54.300 --> 28:55.620
abilities mentioned.

28:55.620 --> 29:01.340
So the program has devised a method to connect a recruit to a brain interface machine where

29:01.340 --> 29:05.340
the pilot controls the machine to control the person's intentions, thus controlling

29:05.340 --> 29:07.020
the craft.

29:07.020 --> 29:14.020
If true and this is a big if, the implications of this program existing are beyond disturbing.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.540
But let's try and keep investigating.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.900
What else can Joey tell us about this insider?

29:18.900 --> 29:26.860
I do know that this insider is real and I can say that because boy, I don't know how

29:26.860 --> 29:30.580
I can publicly acknowledge how I know that.

29:30.580 --> 29:37.500
I will say that there are other people who have corroborated the existence of this insider

29:37.500 --> 29:39.140
to me personally.

29:39.140 --> 29:49.900
I know that he took Michael to this location and so due to what I know this location to

29:49.900 --> 29:58.500
be officially, it leads me to believe that this person has quite a bit of authority to

29:58.500 --> 30:04.780
be able to bring him to this location in the nature in which he did.

30:05.300 --> 30:14.300
My first question is how the heck does anyone get to bring a random person, Michael Herrera?

30:14.300 --> 30:15.700
Especially a civilian at the time.

30:15.700 --> 30:16.700
For sure.

30:16.700 --> 30:17.700
Yeah.

30:17.700 --> 30:18.940
That's impossible, right?

30:18.940 --> 30:25.340
There's got to be all the security and cross-checking and surveillance of every person who's walking

30:25.340 --> 30:31.820
in and out of the place and the way this all went down was just like, holy crap.

30:31.820 --> 30:34.380
He literally did that.

30:34.380 --> 30:37.060
So what are the implications of that?

30:37.060 --> 30:42.540
So I know Michael was taken to this location and I know the insider exists, but I don't

30:42.540 --> 30:45.060
know if anything the insider is saying is true.

30:45.060 --> 30:49.180
So the insider has provided Michael with a lot of leaks, information about the Black

30:49.180 --> 30:50.180
Program.

30:50.180 --> 30:54.100
He's specifically involved with the crash retrieval aspect.

30:54.100 --> 30:59.220
So the question on my mind, and I'm guessing all of yours too, is why did this insider

30:59.220 --> 31:01.780
tell all of this to Michael?

31:01.780 --> 31:06.860
If this was a Psyop, why bring Michael all the way to this black site and show him all

31:06.860 --> 31:09.260
of this unknown stuff?

31:09.260 --> 31:13.940
And even if the insider is lying, this still does not account for Michael's experience

31:13.940 --> 31:15.980
seeing the UFO in 2009.

31:15.980 --> 31:19.380
That experience is not negated if this is a Psyop.

31:19.380 --> 31:23.980
To me, both sides of the coin seem somewhat logical and plausible.

31:23.980 --> 31:30.980
I often think back to the story of Paul Benowitz, who in 1989 was driven to insanity by being

31:30.980 --> 31:36.060
fed false information about extraterrestrials by the CIA.

31:36.060 --> 31:41.360
This is a fascinating story I might cover one day because it's really worth knowing.

31:41.360 --> 31:46.860
On the other hand, if this figure is pro-disclosure but does not want to be public, it does make

31:46.860 --> 31:49.340
sense for him to use Michael as a vessel.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.900
Let's see what Joey thinks.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.900
These guys don't want to come out publicly.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.460
They have a lot at risk.

31:55.460 --> 32:02.220
And personally, they have no interest in being like public figures about this topic.

32:02.220 --> 32:07.860
There are allegedly a lot of factions within the program who aren't interested in this

32:07.860 --> 32:16.420
becoming disclosed, and so there's personal risk with that as well.

32:16.420 --> 32:23.820
And so I think he saw in Michael someone who was already comfortable with that risk of

32:23.820 --> 32:30.100
being a whistleblower, and because he had that connection of understanding the operation

32:30.100 --> 32:42.420
that Michael had witnessed, felt that he would be a good person to try to reach out to.

32:42.420 --> 32:47.060
Something that raises suspicion about The Insider for both Joey and myself is the story

32:47.060 --> 32:48.460
of a book.

32:48.460 --> 32:52.740
A few weeks after the meeting, The Insider told Michael he was in the process of writing

32:52.740 --> 32:54.740
a book under a ghostwriter.

32:54.740 --> 32:59.580
The purpose of this book was to hide truth and fiction, similar to Secret Machines by

32:59.580 --> 33:01.380
Tom DeLonge.

33:01.380 --> 33:05.060
This book is titled Sentinels of Aether.

33:05.060 --> 33:08.940
What sticks out to me as concerning here is the book was framed to be corroborating evidence

33:08.940 --> 33:14.060
to support Michael's story, however, the connecting threads are thin at best.

33:14.060 --> 33:19.660
In fact, this book is about an event that occurred in Mexico in 2004 in which a paramilitary

33:19.660 --> 33:25.300
group in the Black Program wipe out an entire JSOC team during an operation.

33:25.300 --> 33:29.700
The Black team is described as transporting humans inside shipping containers to a hidden

33:29.700 --> 33:34.340
base in a mountain, which is similar to the containers Michael Herrera describes in his

33:34.340 --> 33:35.340
encounter.

33:35.340 --> 33:39.980
I didn't mention this earlier, but one of the things that Michael had been excited about

33:39.980 --> 33:45.300
with this meeting was he was supposedly going to be given some evidence that would support

33:45.300 --> 33:48.500
his claims.

33:48.500 --> 34:11.860
And the insider actually provided a two-chapter manuscript of the book currently under Dobser

34:11.860 --> 34:15.060
Review to remove classified information.

34:15.060 --> 34:20.820
In the insider's own words, he is playing a scheme or 4D chess on Dobser.

34:20.820 --> 34:25.220
And of course, for those of you who don't know, Dobser is the Defense Office of Pre-Publication

34:25.220 --> 34:27.020
and Security Review.

34:27.020 --> 34:30.500
This is what David Grush is currently going through with his op-ed right now, so he doesn't

34:30.500 --> 34:32.880
divulge any classified information.

34:32.880 --> 34:41.900
And he does provide some context as to the sort of scheme that he's trying to play on

34:41.900 --> 34:48.580
Dobser where he's intentionally, you know, including certain information that he knows,

34:48.580 --> 34:53.820
you know, shouldn't be flagged by Dobser because it's like deep black projects that shouldn't

34:53.820 --> 34:54.820
be acknowledged.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.660
And he's trying to see if they'll catch it.

34:56.660 --> 35:02.580
And it, I don't know, it just sounds, it just sounds a little sketchy, to be honest.

35:02.580 --> 35:09.300
In fact, the insider directly quotes, quote, our intention is to put the DoD in a pickle

35:09.300 --> 35:11.140
by creating dilemmas.

35:11.140 --> 35:15.180
We are strategically taking advantage of the fact they must respond.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.180
They don't have a choice.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.420
No poker face.

35:17.420 --> 35:23.300
Any response will provide us with information slash intelligence and inverse intelligence.

35:23.300 --> 35:28.300
One of the other things that Joey has more information on than almost anybody else are

35:28.300 --> 35:33.260
the thoughts and words of Michael's fellow platoon members who were with him in Indonesia

35:33.260 --> 35:34.980
in 2009.

35:34.980 --> 35:39.460
According to the original Daily Mail article that was written on Herrera, the other four

35:39.460 --> 35:43.820
or five Marines in Herrera's platoon were too scared to come forward.

35:43.820 --> 35:49.060
Bar one text message that read, quote, Hey man, this is asking too much of me.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.740
It's not worth the risk.

35:50.740 --> 35:55.260
My family and military career far exceed anything you are asking of me.

35:55.260 --> 35:58.180
It's not worth my life or jeopardizing my family.

35:58.180 --> 36:01.500
I know we go back, but this is asking too much.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.860
You need to get out of whatever you are in and don't get me involved.

36:04.860 --> 36:12.620
So I've talked to a handful of people who were in his platoon and were on that mission,

36:12.620 --> 36:13.620
on that ship.

36:13.620 --> 36:20.860
I would say not the UFO mission, the alleged UFO mission, but I'll say the Indonesia relief

36:20.860 --> 36:22.700
effort mission or operation.

36:22.700 --> 36:29.140
I will say that out of those people that I have spoken to, all of them believe Michael

36:29.140 --> 36:35.220
is lying, except for, well, except for one.

36:35.220 --> 36:43.420
There's one person that I've reached out to and asked for permission to ask some questions

36:43.420 --> 36:44.420
about it.

36:44.420 --> 36:49.300
And he just said, no, thank you and leave my name out of everything.

36:49.300 --> 36:52.580
But everyone else thinks Michael is lying.

36:52.580 --> 36:58.220
But the thing that's interesting is, you know, once I get into conversation with these people,

36:58.220 --> 37:06.100
they quickly reveal that, you know, because someone says very strongly, I know he's lying.

37:06.100 --> 37:12.100
My follow-up question is, oh, so you were boots on the ground with him in Indonesia?

37:12.100 --> 37:17.060
And their reply is, well, no, I was in a different squad or oh, no, I was, I was, I stayed on

37:17.060 --> 37:18.060
the ship.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.060
I didn't leave the ship.

37:19.060 --> 37:23.740
And so immediately I'm like, well, you can't possibly know he's lying because you weren't

37:23.740 --> 37:24.740
there.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.940
Like how can you say you know he's lying?

37:26.940 --> 37:32.140
So, you know, that was really disappointing to hear.

37:32.140 --> 37:37.700
However, I still, I still maintained conversations with these people because they did, you know,

37:37.700 --> 37:43.780
certain people provided some, you know, personal photographs that I was able to, you know, there

37:43.780 --> 37:50.660
was nothing crazy in the photographs, but it did prove that they were in, you know, the

37:50.660 --> 37:54.420
Taming Airport where the coordination efforts were happening.

37:54.580 --> 38:01.100
There's one person who I do find very credible who speaks against Michael.

38:01.100 --> 38:09.660
I'll just say his first name, his name's Nathan, and he was Michael's team leader.

38:09.660 --> 38:17.100
And he provided, so I've had several, you know, text conversations with him, and he

38:17.100 --> 38:28.380
provided a photograph that he alleges shows Michael and another Marine on a helicopter.

38:28.380 --> 38:32.060
And he says they're all being flown into Indonesia.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.340
They don't have rifles, right?

38:34.340 --> 38:39.460
This photograph is important because if it is proven to be Michael, it kind of shows

38:39.460 --> 38:46.260
that he's lying about something, you know, or, you know, most of the story gets kind

38:46.260 --> 38:51.460
of discredited because, you know, the big part of Michael's story was he had rifles

38:51.460 --> 38:58.220
and, you know, he was with different people.

38:58.220 --> 39:02.460
So Michael, you know, I did share that photograph with Michael.

39:02.460 --> 39:03.620
I didn't give him any contacts.

39:03.620 --> 39:07.980
I just said, do you know who's in this photograph?

39:07.980 --> 39:10.860
And he provided two names.

39:10.860 --> 39:16.220
And, you know, then I explained, you know, that the allegations that one of one of the

39:16.220 --> 39:20.900
people is him and, and he denies it, he very strongly denies it.

39:20.900 --> 39:27.380
And what's interesting to me to kind of play towards Michael in a way, let's say Nathan's

39:27.380 --> 39:33.820
telling the truth, let's say Michael did fly in with him without rifles.

39:33.820 --> 39:38.140
And let's say Michael was on that flight, right?

39:38.140 --> 39:42.500
What that would mean if he is lying about this UFO thing?

39:42.500 --> 39:48.740
That means he was thinking, let me, let me make up a story about a UFO, but also let

39:48.740 --> 39:57.620
me lie in about a mission I know I went on with my squad, even though he knows there

39:57.620 --> 40:02.300
were witnesses and he knows, you know, his photo is being taken.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.580
That just doesn't make any sense to me.

40:03.580 --> 40:08.060
Like why would he, like he could have very easily just said, yeah, that is me in the

40:08.060 --> 40:13.580
photograph, but I also took a different flight in later on or earlier in the day.

40:13.580 --> 40:17.580
You know, he could have made it so he could have just acknowledged that both things are

40:17.580 --> 40:22.500
true and it would have totally negated that photographic evidence.

40:22.500 --> 40:27.780
The question of rifles or lack thereof in Nathan's alleged photograph is crucial.

40:27.780 --> 40:33.340
Since Indonesia 2009 was a humanitarian mission, Marines were not supposed to be equipped with

40:33.340 --> 40:34.540
rifles.

40:34.540 --> 40:38.580
As I stated earlier, and what was actually confirmed to Joey by all the Marines he spoke

40:38.580 --> 40:44.620
to, the first wave of Marines in Indonesia were in fact armed, but subsequent deployments

40:44.620 --> 40:46.780
were not due to bad optics.

40:46.780 --> 40:50.900
Allegedly, an Air Force Colonel yelled at the Marines and ordered them to stop utilizing

40:50.900 --> 40:52.740
rifles.

40:52.740 --> 40:57.100
And now the reason why probably half of you are watching this video with a renewed interest

40:57.100 --> 41:02.020
in Michael Herrera, the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1.

41:02.020 --> 41:08.060
In this report, Michael Herrera is all but named as somebody who testified to Arrow stating

41:08.060 --> 41:09.060
quote,

41:09.060 --> 41:14.740
An interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said in that 2009, while participating

41:14.740 --> 41:20.100
in a humanitarian and security mission in a foreign country, he encountered U.S. special

41:20.100 --> 41:25.100
forces loading containers onto a large extraterrestrial spacecraft.

41:25.100 --> 41:29.220
And guys, I probably don't need to explain this to you, but Arrow Historical Report Volume

41:29.220 --> 41:32.980
1 is not the most accurate report we've ever seen.

41:32.980 --> 41:39.220
In fact, in this two to three sentence summary of Michael Herrera, there are two factual inaccuracies.

41:39.220 --> 41:43.740
One, Michael never claimed he encountered U.S. special forces.

41:43.740 --> 41:48.180
What he said was he encountered men with American dialects.

41:48.180 --> 41:55.540
With American gear, but no rank, no insignia, no identifiers to where they belonged.

41:55.540 --> 42:01.860
And two, Herrera said, even from his first statement, he thought the craft he saw was

42:01.860 --> 42:05.300
human reverse engineered, not extraterrestrial.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.780
Is this just awful writing or purposeful disinformation?

42:08.780 --> 42:11.460
I lean more towards purposeful.

42:11.460 --> 42:16.700
I think this is so bogus and just in a two sentence summary, getting so many facts wrong.

42:16.700 --> 42:22.380
In my opinion, this sort of misreporting is on purpose and a symptom of the larger sickness

42:22.380 --> 42:24.260
that is this report.

42:24.260 --> 42:28.300
And I just want to touch on what seems to be a big misconception in the UAP community

42:28.300 --> 42:30.720
on Twitter and Reddit at the moment.

42:30.720 --> 42:35.780
On page 32, under the section, the UAP with peculiar characteristics refers to an authentic

42:35.780 --> 42:38.500
non-UAP related SAP.

42:38.500 --> 42:43.580
Some people are confusing this statement as describing Michael Herrera.

42:43.580 --> 42:47.740
In the statement, it says, Arrow was able to correlate this account with an authentic

42:47.740 --> 42:52.860
USG program because the interviewee was able to provide a relatively precise time and location.

42:52.860 --> 42:57.100
As first pointed out to me by Joey, Michael narrowed down the timing of the event to within

42:57.100 --> 43:00.940
a couple days, but he did not know the precise time.

43:00.940 --> 43:06.020
And Michael did not know the exact location of the landing zone in Indonesia.

43:06.020 --> 43:12.780
In the same section, whatever person was writing this error report stated that the seemingly

43:12.780 --> 43:17.380
strange characteristics reported by the interviewee matched closely with the platform's characteristics

43:17.380 --> 43:20.780
which was being tested at a military facility in the timeframe.

43:20.780 --> 43:22.240
The interviewee was there.

43:22.240 --> 43:27.160
But again, as Joey points out, Michael's encounter occurred in a remote part of the

43:27.160 --> 43:31.080
jungle in Indonesia, not a military facility.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.640
What was massively vindicating to Joey and something that made him place more trust in

43:35.640 --> 43:41.160
Michael, and he even relayed this to me months before the Arrow Historical Report Volume

43:41.160 --> 43:46.960
1, Michael had actually told Joey and provided him proof that he had testified to Arrow.

43:46.960 --> 43:50.960
He said that they didn't record his testimony like they did.

43:50.960 --> 43:56.400
They weren't actually like electronically recording his testimony.

43:56.400 --> 44:02.800
There were just people in a skiff and some of them had notepads and were just like taking

44:02.800 --> 44:04.320
notes occasionally.

44:04.320 --> 44:13.640
So the summary of his testimony in the report could literally just be the result of poor

44:13.640 --> 44:23.640
note-taking and I am perfectly comfortable with accusing them of doing this intentionally

44:23.640 --> 44:32.280
because it certainly seems like something that they were trying to prevent as much of

44:32.280 --> 44:43.520
a paper trail as possible and leaving a lot of the records up to interpretation.

44:43.520 --> 44:47.160
I think that was 100% intentional.

44:47.160 --> 44:56.720
So I don't know if it was malicious misquoting of Michael or just literally poor note-taking

44:56.720 --> 45:03.240
and someone read someone else's notes and summarized and misinterpreted or whatever.

45:03.240 --> 45:09.000
Did he testify to Dr. Kirkpatrick or was it just Arrow employees?

45:09.000 --> 45:13.680
He says it was directly to Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the room.

45:13.680 --> 45:18.920
But another thing that I'll mention as well, something that I kind of caught was speaking

45:18.920 --> 45:27.000
of that statute that would provide penalties to anyone who lies, I noticed that Arrow was

45:27.000 --> 45:34.760
extremely careful in their report not to accuse a single whistleblower of lying or misleading.

45:34.760 --> 45:46.160
They emphasized how accepting they are of the fact that these whistleblowers believe

45:46.160 --> 45:50.080
what they're telling Arrow.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.560
And again, I think that was incredibly intentional.

45:52.560 --> 45:58.720
It was really like the first opening statement in the report.

45:58.720 --> 46:02.800
If you really highlight the key words there, it's literally all about belief.

46:02.840 --> 46:08.760
I'm just emphasizing belief and everyone's entitled to their belief and we can't criticize

46:08.760 --> 46:12.480
or hold it against anyone if they believe something.

46:12.480 --> 46:19.560
And that was intentional so that nobody could ... I previously asserted that Arrow would

46:19.560 --> 46:23.520
be forced to prosecute if they lied, but that's not really the case.

46:23.520 --> 46:26.920
I kind of misspoke there really.

46:26.920 --> 46:33.080
I think it would still would have made an opportunity for other lawyers or organizations

46:33.080 --> 46:41.600
to press charges against whistleblowers if they had lied and Arrow would be kind of

46:41.600 --> 46:45.800
in a position potentially to provide evidence that supports that assertion.

46:45.800 --> 46:54.520
So they wanted to make sure to avoid that at all costs and that's why they did that.

46:54.520 --> 46:59.160
Of course, I was fascinated to know if Michael had spoken to any other whistleblowers or

46:59.160 --> 47:01.320
people behind the scenes.

47:01.320 --> 47:06.040
While Joey understandably couldn't comment, he did tell me something interesting that

47:06.040 --> 47:07.880
kind of made me jump for joy.

47:07.880 --> 47:16.480
I do know that he has spoken to Jonathan Weighant, which was pretty interesting because they

47:16.480 --> 47:22.040
did have sort of similar experiences.

47:22.040 --> 47:27.360
So yeah, so that was really cool to think that Jonathan kind of had gotten the chance

47:27.360 --> 47:31.800
to speak with someone else that had a similar experience.

47:31.800 --> 47:37.180
I personally believe it is probable that Michael and Weighant encountered the same insider

47:37.180 --> 47:39.120
paramilitary group.

47:39.120 --> 47:43.600
Too many similarities to men with American dialects and all black gear that appear to

47:43.600 --> 47:45.960
have highly skilled backgrounds.

47:45.960 --> 47:51.240
Of course, in Weighant's case, he did specifically see men in DOE rain jackets, which allowed

47:51.240 --> 47:54.920
me to conclude that these are likely a DOE NES team.

47:54.920 --> 47:59.560
Again watch that analysis in my Marines video and then listen back to Michael's testimony

47:59.560 --> 48:02.040
and cross reference the two teams.

48:02.040 --> 48:06.640
And lastly guys, I kind of wanted to touch on some of the criticism that Joey has received.

48:06.640 --> 48:12.560
He has received so much support for his investigation, but also a lot of hate online.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.920
People calling him Michael's shill, people calling him Michael's publicist, or even

48:15.920 --> 48:18.120
Michael under a pseudonym.

48:18.120 --> 48:22.760
And understandably so, he's received some flak for receiving evidence, yet not making

48:22.760 --> 48:24.120
it public.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.640
Let's see what he has to say.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.920
I'm in no way his publicist.

48:28.920 --> 48:37.160
Yeah, I there's a few exceptions to that where there there were people that I felt would

48:37.160 --> 48:41.120
be good people to interview him.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.580
One of them is Chris Leto.

48:42.580 --> 48:47.200
So that was a case where I reached out to Chris and kind of did made the first contact

48:47.200 --> 48:48.800
and then introduced him.

48:48.800 --> 48:57.600
I just hope people will be open to continuing to just follow, you know, more as as the story

48:57.600 --> 49:02.400
unfolds because it's a very, it's a very interesting case because you not only do you have this

49:02.400 --> 49:08.840
historical event that happened in 2009 that still has a ton of data that is yet to be

49:08.840 --> 49:10.640
uncovered.

49:10.640 --> 49:15.280
Even by myself, you know, yes, there's things that I do have privately that I can't share,

49:15.280 --> 49:21.160
but there's also, you know, other data that hasn't been uncovered by myself or anyone.

49:21.160 --> 49:25.560
But now we have this kind of current thing that's unfolding as we speak.

49:25.560 --> 49:32.200
I mean, there are there are things happening right now behind the scenes as we speak.

49:32.200 --> 49:37.480
So I think I think it's incredibly interesting and worth paying attention to.

49:37.480 --> 49:42.920
And you know, no one has to make a decision about whether they think it's true or false

49:42.920 --> 49:43.920
at this point.

49:44.040 --> 49:50.920
I've been taking this a lot more seriously than I ever did previously, and I am giving

49:50.920 --> 49:58.080
the benefit of the doubt to the other people involved behind the scenes.

49:58.080 --> 50:01.840
And I'm and I am taking them very seriously.

50:01.840 --> 50:11.280
And I'm respecting anybody's request for me not to reveal certain information because

50:11.360 --> 50:13.120
that's that's just the right thing to do.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.680
And people criticize me.

50:14.680 --> 50:18.960
And it's and it it kills me because I totally understand the criticism.

50:18.960 --> 50:25.920
I can't even argue the criticism because I did make the decision to kind of have this

50:25.920 --> 50:32.600
compromise where I'd reach out to people like yourself and other, you know, podcasters and

50:32.600 --> 50:40.520
journalists and people who I trust and, you know, reveal my identity, you know, you and

50:40.640 --> 50:44.440
I, we had a we've we've had video calls, you've seen my face, you know, who I am.

50:45.280 --> 50:50.200
And I've shared some information with you that backs up some of my evidence of or, you

50:50.200 --> 50:54.160
know, shared some of my evidence that backs up my opinions on certain things.

50:54.560 --> 51:00.160
And so really, as the best compromise I could come up with, you know, for now, I do hope

51:00.160 --> 51:05.040
to get to a point where I can be public and share more evidence.

51:05.920 --> 51:10.200
But for right now, that that was kind of the best compromise I could come up with.

51:11.080 --> 51:15.400
And one last thing I'd like to touch on is the connection between Michael Herrera and

51:15.400 --> 51:16.200
Stephen Greer.

51:16.840 --> 51:21.400
I've touched upon this in almost every single one of my videos where there is a whistleblower,

51:22.040 --> 51:24.440
even my Marines video because of Jonathan Wagon.

51:24.880 --> 51:27.640
So if you're interested to hear more, go check any of those out.

51:28.440 --> 51:32.200
But I think it's important to start separating the whistleblowers from Dr.

51:32.200 --> 51:35.400
Greer. It's no surprise I have my problems with Dr.

51:35.400 --> 51:40.960
Greer, but I'm trying to take an approach where I will individually vet whistleblowers

51:40.960 --> 51:43.040
and people separate from Greer.

51:43.480 --> 51:47.160
I see a lot of people saying that these two are in cahoots, which is just blatantly not

51:47.160 --> 51:50.960
true. In fact, Michael himself has said that Dr.

51:50.960 --> 51:54.800
Greer has embellished or purposefully lied about details of his story.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.040
There's been some interviews that Dr.

51:58.040 --> 52:01.960
Greer has done and everything like that, where he's told people that they put guns

52:01.960 --> 52:03.640
right to our head. That wasn't the case.

52:03.880 --> 52:10.040
These guys were at a standoff distance because it's easier to go like this than actually be

52:10.040 --> 52:13.720
at a standoff distance and try to rush somebody who has had a good distance that can sight in

52:13.720 --> 52:14.360
and just shoot you.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.400
So we need to understand that Dr.

52:17.400 --> 52:22.520
Greer is probably one of the only avenues whistleblowers have to come forward that they know of

52:22.520 --> 52:27.480
before David Grush. Hopefully things change in the future and people start pursuing the avenues

52:27.480 --> 52:32.120
of Grush or maybe Carl Nell or maybe if there's some changes arrow.

52:32.680 --> 52:36.600
But it's important to kind of separate Herrera from Greer.

52:57.880 --> 53:03.080
I would like to thank him for trusting me with some of the more sensitive evidence regarding

53:03.080 --> 53:08.600
Herrera. This case is ongoing and I don't imagine there's going to be just one follow-up video

53:08.600 --> 53:14.280
he and I make to this. Michael Herrera's case has almost consumed me of late.

53:15.160 --> 53:20.200
I think about it all the time. I studied all the time and I talk to Joey about it all the time.

53:21.080 --> 53:25.560
So this case is so fascinating to me. I can't believe I initially brushed it off by buying

53:25.560 --> 53:31.480
into the Greer hate or buying into some of the kind of nonsensical thoughts of just diminishing

53:31.480 --> 53:36.200
his testimony and thinking he's fully because of some details that seem odd at first when

53:36.200 --> 53:42.520
hearing about his story. I am still torn on the insider in terms of is this guy conducting a

53:42.520 --> 53:48.600
psyop or telling Michael real information. I just don't have enough evidence right now to know.

53:49.800 --> 53:54.600
But what do you guys think after hearing some more of this video and hearing from Joey,

53:54.600 --> 54:00.040
do you guys believe more in Michael or less? Has his credibility increased or decreased in

54:00.040 --> 54:04.200
your eyes? I'd love to hear from you guys because this case is so fascinating to me.
