0	4600	With something that stuck out so well, it's always going to be basically imprisoned in
4600	7680	my mind for the rest of my life, and it has been for 14 years.
7680	15760	You look down into the valley, and there's a clearing with a UAP just sitting there.
15760	19760	Sitting there rotating clockwise, and that's in transition this color spectrum, I was telling
19760	20760	you too.
20760	25320	So as far as from a distance, yes, that looks very accurate to what I saw.
25320	27360	Rogue military force, if you will.
27360	31280	The most concerning thing about this is they all had American dialects.
31280	32640	They had American gear.
32640	36000	They had OTVs, black, they had black camouflage.
36000	39280	They had very similar setups to what we had, but more high speed, something what you would
39280	42840	see special operation groups these days have.
42840	44080	They had no insignias on.
44080	45800	And that's what I thought it was it.
45800	48760	I thought they were going to smoke us, you know, and they kept saying that, you know,
48760	51760	we can kill you right now, you know, as this is.
51760	56840	At the start of the year, I made a video titled The Marines Who Got Too Close to UFOs, where
56840	61440	I talked about two whistleblower testimonies of men who encountered UAP throughout their
61440	64320	military service in the USMC.
64320	68880	And this included Jonathan Wagan, and of course, Michael Herrera.
68880	71200	And guys, I'll admit my biases.
71200	75720	While I was really supportive of Jonathan Wagan and found his story to be credible, I was
75720	78120	really dismissive of Herrera.
78120	82120	Now for Michael Herrera, I'm torn on his story.
82120	85360	I just I'm not sure about that.
85360	90440	This all changed when Redditor and now my good friend, Joey is not my name, reached out to
90440	94280	me and asked if I was the creator of this video.
94280	98400	Joey told me that he had been investigating Michael deeply and that he and him had actually
98400	101120	established a relationship and talked weekly.
101120	104880	I even left a paper trail with certain people, including Joey is not my name.
104880	110360	And there's been a person who has helped with that, Joey, that's not my name.
110360	115520	If you're watching this, thank you for your help as more of a person who has broad attention
115520	118600	to detail in a lot of things, which is remarkable.
118600	121680	His Reddit handle is Joey is not my name.
121680	127000	And finally, he told me that he had enough evidence to attest to the fact that Michael
127000	132200	met a man, an insider in the black reverse engineering program.
132200	136920	This brief exchange messages led to a fast friendship between Joey and myself.
136920	142400	And for months, actually, he and I have been talking every day on messaging, video calls
142400	145640	and phone calls discussing Michael's case.
145640	149880	And throughout this time, he has shown me some of the astonishing evidence to both support
149880	156920	Michael's claims of his experience in Indonesia and his experience meeting an insider in the
156920	159120	black reverse engineering programs.
159120	163600	So today, guys, I am thrilled to tell you that I actually have my good friend, Joey is not
163600	168440	my name on the show, to talk about his experience investigating Herrera's case and discuss some
168440	172200	of the evidence he's actually found to corroborate Michael.
172200	176440	If you've never heard of Michael Herrera, I'd be shocked, especially after so much
176440	181760	renewed interest in his encounter, after being all but named in the abomination that is the
181760	184440	Arrow Historical Report Volume 1.
184440	189080	But for those of you who don't know, or may need a quick refresher, let's briefly summarize
189080	191840	Michael's UFO whistleblower encounter.
191840	197080	And guys, please note, as I talk about Michael's testimony, I will be recounting it as fact,
197080	198520	as told by Michael.
198520	204000	The reality is, there is still no way we can prove with evidence that Michael encountered
204000	206840	this UFO in the jungles of Indonesia.
206840	211520	But we can prove with fact some of the context around Michael's story, such as the military
211520	216320	mission in Indonesia and the relief effort by the USAF and Marines.
216320	222320	In the summer of 2023, Stephen Greer's National Press Club event featured an array of whistleblower
222320	227200	individuals, ranging from credible to somewhat dubious.
227200	232840	One of these men was a USMC vet who seemed emboldened to break his 14-year silence, yet
232840	235560	nervous to reveal himself to the public.
235560	240000	It was here Michael Herrera first told his story to the world.
240000	246160	In 2009, 2nd Battalion 5th Marine Michael Herrera, at this time a 20-year-old saw gunner,
246160	251080	was called into Indonesia for a human relief aid mission after the devastating Sumatra
251080	253200	earthquake in Tsunami.
253200	258560	Michael was stationed on the USS Denver, which is oddly enough the name of both of our hometowns.
258560	264080	This was the only ship routed to the west coast of Indonesia from the US 7th Fleet.
264080	269600	In October of 2009, Herrera's unit was informed they would be providing security to aid in
269600	274360	the delivery of food and medical supplies, and it's crucial to note, although humanitarian
274360	280160	missions generally do not see soldiers equipped with weapons, the 1st Marines reportedly were,
280160	285600	and in this case, M16A4s due to the heavy presence of terrorist training in the area.
285600	291360	Herrera's team arrived near Pandang from CH-53 Helos at a hasty LZ, where the team
291360	296120	pushed to a high ground for reconnaissance purposes, and it's worth noting and rightfully
296120	301400	one of the biggest points of contention surrounding Michael's testimony, Herrera states his team
301400	307920	was not equipped with radio comms, and Michael himself states this was highly abnormal.
307920	312160	The team trekked up a ridge at an elevation of roughly 300 meters.
312160	318000	Herrera had on him a Panasonic camera and was taking images of the surrounding area.
318000	321960	Once the Marines reached the high point of the ridge, something quote, stuck out like
321960	325900	a sore thumb, end quote, against the jungle terrain.
325900	331220	There was a craft rotating just above the tree line, transitioning colors between a
331220	334660	light matte gray and a dark matte black.
334660	340020	Perplexed, the team decided to approach and investigate, and it's key to note, Michael
340020	344300	did in fact take pictures of the craft with the camera he stored in his spent magazine
344300	345820	pouch.
345820	350980	Reaching down the slope, the USMC team was about 150 meters from the craft.
350980	355780	It was from here Michael estimated the craft to be 300 feet in diameter.
355780	362660	It was octagonal in shape, rotating clockwise with Vantablack exterior panels and a pyramid
362660	364300	type shape on top.
364300	384460	The craft let off an audible hum, almost like a guitar amp.
384460	391700	The craft floated 15-20 feet above the ground, surrounded by a quote, rogue military force.
391700	397620	What was astounding is these men featured American dialects, American gear, and similar
397620	401240	setups the Marines had but with much better equipment.
401240	404540	These men had no rank, no insignia.
404540	408340	Eight of the men engaged the Marines, directing their weapons at the soldiers and flipping
408340	413500	off the weapon safeties, screaming at the Marines, asking what they were doing there,
414500	415500	and threatening their lives.
415500	420500	Terrified the Marines complied, they were padded down and stripped of their weapons.
420500	425980	The rogue operators even knew to take the Marines military IDs out of their left breast
425980	431780	pocket, where they snapped pictures of Herrera and his fellow Marines identifications.
431780	436900	During this time, Michael occasionally shifted his glance back to the large UFO, where four
436900	442780	F-350s sat with weapon cases and containers with an oxygen or humidity control unit which
442780	447940	held what Michael would later come to learn were human beings.
447940	452060	The F-350s loaded the supplies onto a platform below the craft.
452060	457900	When the platform itself rose from the ground, connected with the craft, and the two connected
457900	466500	pieces shot off westward instantaneously, no rotor wash, no exhaust, no sonic boom, none
466500	469900	of the surrounding vegetation was disturbed in any way.
469900	474460	When Marines were told to turn around, Michael thought that this was it, they were dead.
474460	479900	Until the operators began reloading the soldiers' equipment and magazines back onto their persons.
479900	483860	Escorting the Marines back up to the slopes, the operators told Michael and his fellow
483860	490100	soldiers they were not allowed to look back or talk about what they had seen.
490100	493980	Breaking the hillside, the Marines ran back to the LZ, where a resident gunnery sergeant
493980	498180	grew furious at the non-combat-effective Marines.
498180	502780	Flying back to the USS Denver, an admiral debriefed the team, and a few days later while
502780	508660	on leave, the battery and SD card to Michael's camera were taken, along with the fellow Marine
508660	510420	cell phones.
510420	515900	And finally, when the USS Denver tracked back to Okinawa, a man in use-half blues with no
515900	521340	name tag, pulled Michael into his office, where he told him to never tell anybody of
521340	526660	his encounter, regardless of chain of command, discussing the event would lead to imprisonment
526660	528340	or death.
528340	534020	Michael was then forced to sign an NDA to never speak about the experience.
534020	545180	And what really triggered me into being motivated to look into the case myself was hearing all
545180	553500	of the negative reaction towards him for reasons that I felt were really flimsy.
553500	561540	People were criticizing him because he said they didn't have radios, or because he mislabeled
561540	563540	the name of a rifle or something.
563540	571940	And I just thought that was pretty absurd to completely dismiss a whistleblower when you're
571940	578180	literally sitting here considering a story about a 300-foot UFO, but because they didn't
578180	583300	have a radio, that's too unbelievable for you, so let's just dismiss the whole thing.
583300	594300	If the UFO community did not have the open-mindedness and patience and space to provide a whistleblower
594300	602940	to give time to investigate and vet the story, and if we were just going to shoot them down
602940	610460	immediately for really lame reasons, how are we going to expect the general public to take
610460	615580	this seriously if we can't even give it a chance?
615580	621780	The other thing was it dawned on me, this is a military operation and humanitarian operation,
621780	630940	so there's a ton of photojournalism, journalists, military reports and assessments that were
630940	633860	done all around this operation.
633860	640020	So I saw that as a great opportunity to begin digging into the details to see if I could
640020	645340	find any conflicts with Michael's testimony.
645340	652420	And I ended up finding the opposite, that I was corroborating everything that I could
652420	655620	find corroborated what he was saying.
655620	661900	Now obviously that doesn't prove he saw a UFO, but it does corroborate all of the details
661900	665300	around that operation that he was on.
665300	672500	And so I made a post on Reddit kind of detailing those things that I found.
672860	677860	Joey's first Reddit post titled Verifying the Events Around Michael Herrera's UFO Encounter
677860	684580	Part 1, saw to confirm all the little bits and pieces of the military operation in 2009.
684580	689900	Logically, if Michael could be found to be lying about any detail regarding the humanitarian
689900	696180	mission, his whole testimony could be thrown out the window as, another UFO want to be.
696180	702140	Joey provided documentable evidence to support all of the context Michael provided including,
702140	707820	the USS Denver was the sole ship assigned to support Indonesian military efforts, regardless
707820	710300	of Michael finding this strange.
710300	715340	The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit was present at this operation.
715340	719740	CH-53 Super Stallion choppers were used to deliver aid.
719740	725620	And finally, the confirmation of hasty LZs, threw a blog post which detailed efforts done
725620	730220	by the US forces to deliver supplies to critical and remote areas.
730220	735260	Of course, none of this actually proves that Michael saw a UFO lost in service, but this
735260	740580	post does confirm key smaller elements of his story, including accurately depicting the
740580	742940	military op in Indonesia.
742940	748140	Joey includes a call to action asking Michael to reach out for further investigation.
748140	756780	So my plan was to do a part two where I would, I wanted to figure out where the landing zone
756780	757780	was.
757780	763020	I thought if I could reach out to Michael and we could work together to figure out where
763020	765900	the landing zone was, I have the 3D modeling background.
765900	772420	So what I wanted to do was import that terrain into, you know, some 3D modeling software
772420	780740	and be able to perform like additional analysis to cross check his estimates of distances
780740	783700	and heights and scales of things.
783700	791740	And I also thought it was important to illustrate the distances that are involved in this encounter
791740	798140	because the landing zone was almost 700 or 800 meters away from where the craft was sighted
798140	802380	with a hill in between in the middle of jungle.
802380	807660	And so that was really my only thought for reaching out to Michael.
807660	814140	I had no idea it was going to, you know, kind of spiral, spiral much deeper into what it
814140	815140	has.
815140	822580	I mean, how, how rare is it that we get any sort of testimony that isn't, that's literally
822580	826100	just it, you know, most times it's literally just testimony.
826100	828980	It's just someone's verbal account of what happened.
828980	829980	There's no evidence.
829980	830980	There's no nothing.
830980	838580	So here we have a military operation that has, you know, aerial surveys being conducted.
838580	843900	I'm sure there's plenty of satellite imagery, you know, that exists and just all of the
843900	848220	different records that kind of track the movements of things.
848220	853100	You know, it just that reason alone seems like a very exciting case to dig into where
853100	856740	you have a lot of opportunity to uncover data.
856740	860140	Literally that same day that I emailed him.
860140	861140	He called me that night.
861140	868300	We spoke for about a half hour and, you know, I got the sense that he respected the amount
868300	871980	of effort I put into that post and just the, you know, just putting in the work.
871980	877660	I have a feeling it was part of why he started to trust me and respect me moving forward.
877660	881500	You know, he started trusting me with, with certain sensitive information that, that did
881500	888300	help, you know, back up some of his, some of his claims, circumstantially, I'll say.
888300	893540	Then he started telling me more about this insider.
893540	898460	The discussion around this program insider who met with and disclosed leaks to Michael
898460	903860	is where some followers of this case, including myself, justifiably raised red flags and heightened
903860	905500	their skepticism.
905500	909600	But who is this insider and for what reason did he meet with Michael?
909600	913420	What can Joey tell us about this meeting and how can he prove Michael was flown out to
913420	917020	a secure facility to meet with this shadowy figure?
917020	921520	And also do not worry when we get to the actual contents of the meeting, we will of course
921520	925940	discuss all of the leaks that were told to Michael by this insider.
925940	930260	Michael's first encounter with this insider was actually mentioned on his first public
930260	935540	appearance on Stephen Greer's national press club panel, which come to find out through
935540	940180	recent revelations from yesterday from somebody who came forward to Dr. Greer.
940180	944700	I don't know who they are, but what they had told him and what he has told me is that
944860	948660	this gentleman knows exactly what these were used for because they had like a cylinder on
948660	954300	the front, which is either for oxygen or what I have hypothesized was for vacuum sealing,
954300	960580	which believed me to suspect that they were smuggling narcotics or drugs.
960580	962660	Come to find out it's more disturbing than that.
962660	967780	This gentleman has first hand account with this and says that it was for people.
967780	972300	This insider wanted to meet Michael in person.
972300	976860	And so he asked Dr. Greer to make the connection.
976860	982740	And so, you know, he introduced the two or passed along phone numbers or whatever.
982740	986140	And so Michael's telling me all this, you know, that this this insider wants to meet
986140	988100	him and all this stuff.
988100	995820	And I found it very suspicious, you know, I found it very strange that not only would
995860	1004420	he have this really incredible story about seeing a UFO in Indonesia, a huge 300 foot
1004420	1008500	UFO, which is is pretty unique.
1008500	1009500	I don't know.
1009500	1013820	I personally don't know of too many stories like that that big.
1013820	1018820	And now you're telling me that that literally an insider wants to meet you like, come on,
1018820	1024420	this is, you know, this is pretty outrageous, you know, how did how did Michael react when
1024420	1025900	he was approached by the insider?
1025900	1026660	Was he excited?
1026660	1027580	Was he skeptical?
1027580	1030460	Was he possibly worried for his safety?
1030460	1037260	Yeah, he was, he was very, he, he, I mean, the last time, if you think about it, like
1037260	1042140	the last time he's interacted with any of these people, they had guns pointed at him
1042140	1044140	and, you know, we're threatening to kill him and stuff.
1044140	1048900	And so now here's someone, you know, allegedly associated with that.
1048980	1057380	And, but he just felt like if he wants to move this forward, he's got to, he's got to
1057380	1059500	take the chance and do it.
1059500	1069100	And for me, you know, at the time, this was pretty early on in my interactions with Michael.
1069100	1074260	And I didn't feel like I had the sort of relationship with him where I could, you know, ask
1074260	1077500	questions or provide advice or anything like that.
1077500	1083420	You know, I was basically just kind of respectfully, you know, taking information from him that
1083420	1088380	he felt comfortable sharing with me.
1088380	1092100	But I wanted to scream at him and say, dude, like, are you crazy?
1092100	1098820	And mind you, I went back and forth constantly through this period where I would allow myself
1098820	1104220	to pretend it's all real and like, you know, let myself just kind of sit there for a minute
1104220	1109540	and be like, all right, let's say this is all real, holy crap, this is, he's crazy.
1109540	1113100	Like he can't go and meet this guy, he's going to kill him, you know.
1113100	1117860	And then there were times where I would be feeling the opposite and being like, okay,
1117860	1125820	this is, this is clearly like a setup and he's telling me stuff that he's telling me
1125820	1126820	is sensitive.
1126820	1131100	But in reality, it's, he wants me to leak it, but he's telling me not to.
1131100	1132980	It's like reverse psychology or something.
1132980	1135580	You know, I need to be really cautious here.
1135580	1141500	And so that was, that was what was going through my mind at the time and it was very much back
1141500	1142660	and forth.
1142660	1148220	But I also felt like I was in a pretty good position because this wasn't anything I had
1148220	1149620	to take action on.
1149620	1153180	I had reached out to him to kind of like try to figure out what the LZ was and then it kind
1153180	1156260	of just snowballed into this other thing.
1156260	1162020	But I felt like I was in a great position because there was really no risk or harm in
1162020	1169660	me just letting things play out and see what happens, you know, Joey was rightfully extremely
1169660	1176540	confused and skeptical as to why Michael confided so much information to him about the insider
1176540	1180260	in the meeting time, date and location.
1180260	1185820	It was then Joey actually realized Michael was using him as a dead man switch.
1185820	1191140	Michael feared what might happen to him being taken out to an unfamiliar location by unfamiliar
1191140	1192140	people.
1192140	1197660	And in case he was in fact killed, Joey should release any and all information he had.
1197660	1203100	That was what made me the most suspicious because it was like he was trusting me with
1203100	1206700	information without any real justification.
1206700	1213260	And then I realized, you know, that he was going out to meet this guy and I got the feeling
1213260	1217060	that he was, you know, telling me this information in case something happened to him.
1217060	1223300	And I called him out on it and told and, you know, he basically said like, yeah, I, you
1223300	1226380	know, if something happens to me while I'm out there, you know, I want you to release
1226380	1228300	all this information.
1228300	1232340	I'm very happy that Joey brought this next point up as he has never actually talked about
1232340	1233740	this publicly.
1233740	1238580	The day before the meeting, Joey and Michael had a conversation about the meeting and Joey
1238580	1241700	recorded this conversation without Michael's knowledge.
1241700	1250860	I called Michael and had a conversation with him about the meeting and I recorded it without
1250860	1252780	his knowledge.
1252780	1263580	And I did that because I felt like I needed proof in case I did need to, in case something
1263580	1267740	did happen to him and, and I couldn't get in touch with him and I needed to reach out
1267740	1272300	to someone to prove that, yes, I'm in touch with Michael and these are the things he's
1272300	1274260	told me and now I can't get ahold of him.
1274260	1278500	I didn't think anyone would believe me unless I had some sort of proof that I was talking
1278500	1279500	to him.
1279500	1280500	So I recorded that.
1280500	1283500	I think I actually shared that with you.
1283500	1284500	Hey, Michael.
1284500	1285500	Hey, what's up?
1285500	1291780	I had a little time before I have to kick off this meeting here at 9.30.
1291780	1292780	Oh, okay.
1292780	1293780	Yeah.
1293780	1296940	Well, I just, you know, first of all, wanted to check in with you to see how you're, how
1296940	1297940	you're doing, how you're feeling.
1297940	1298940	Good.
1298940	1305460	I had a meeting with these guys so I'm kind of, you know, I'm nervous about a little apprehensive,
1305460	1310420	but if this is going to get carried any further than I need to, you know, I need to speak to
1310420	1311420	the horse's mouth.
1311420	1312420	So speak.
1312420	1317940	So I've, I just, you know, it is what it is at this point, but it's fucking crazy.
1317940	1318940	Yeah.
1318940	1319940	I'm, yeah.
1319940	1320940	I just kind of checking in.
1320940	1323740	I mean, like, geez.
1323740	1326180	So everything's basically all set for the meeting.
1326540	1327540	Yeah.
1327540	1328540	Tomorrow for tomorrow.
1328540	1331180	So, so I arrived there around a clock.
1331180	1332180	Yeah.
1332180	1333180	They're time.
1333180	1337180	And then there's, they're picking me up with picking me up.
1337180	1342420	They got a, they're putting me in and then I'm going to some, apparently there's a facility
1342420	1348340	out and that they're taking me to and then like somewhere to go see some things.
1348340	1350980	So I don't know what that entails, but yeah.
1350980	1351980	Yeah.
1351980	1352980	Okay.
1352980	1357180	And then you're going to touch base with me after, afterwards at some point.
1357180	1358180	Yeah.
1358180	1359180	Okay.
1359180	1360180	All right, Michael.
1360180	1361180	Well, be safe.
1361180	1365380	My friend and look forward to touching base with you when you get back.
1365380	1366380	Roger that, man.
1366380	1368380	Thank you for being involved with this too.
1368380	1370580	And, you know, I'm glad that you're checking up on me.
1370580	1371580	Cool.
1371580	1372580	You know, it's great.
1372580	1377100	So yeah, as soon as I get more information, if I'm able to release some things after this
1377100	1378980	meeting, then I'll let you know.
1378980	1379980	Okay.
1379980	1380980	Sounds good.
1380980	1381980	All right, buddy.
1381980	1382980	Bye.
1382980	1389020	What stood out to me most about this conversation was the fear in Michael's voice.
1389020	1393380	He sounded scared like he didn't know what was going to happen to him.
1393380	1399420	And yes, he did provide specific details and also Joey did tell Michael about this recording
1399420	1400420	later on.
1400420	1402100	So please don't hold that against him.
1402100	1406980	Michael knows, but using this information provided by Michael, Joey was able to verify
1406980	1412660	many of the details that Michael claimed, think tracking flight records and such.
1412660	1416660	There's other evidence that I can't share publicly.
1416660	1422500	I think I did, I did share that, like some censored, a censored version of that evidence
1422500	1428540	with you and guys, I have seen a lot of people dismiss or get on Joey's case for not sharing
1428540	1429860	this evidence.
1429860	1433740	He has in fact shown me a censored version of this evidence.
1433780	1438780	And if Joey is telling the truth, which I believe he is, and showing me an undocked
1438780	1443980	version of this evidence, I can say with a high degree of certainty that this meeting
1443980	1445820	did in fact take place.
1445820	1450460	This isn't to say anything about what the insider showed or told Michael.
1450460	1455100	I can't comment on that legitimacy nor can Joey, we don't know.
1455100	1459980	The evidence, of course, is not mine to share or to an extent, even Joey's.
1459980	1465980	There is a larger behind the scenes investigation here being conducted that if shared publicly
1465980	1470540	could compromise the investigation, or at the very least, make it somewhat hairy.
1470540	1475980	I personally hope that the finer details of this investigation and Joey's evidence will
1475980	1477420	come to light soon.
1477420	1486260	I essentially was able to prove that Michael was taken to a secure facility, is how I refer
1486260	1489060	to it, with this insider.
1489140	1494980	And so for me, and the thing is, is like, I didn't have to rely on any trust of Michael.
1494980	1499460	Like I didn't have to rely, like none of this is contingent upon me having to trust any
1499460	1502460	word that any person has told me.
1502460	1509380	This is objective data and evidence that I used to verify this.
1509380	1518860	When he got back, and we started talking, I didn't immediately reveal to him that I
1518860	1521740	was able to track where he went.
1521740	1534340	And so I used that opportunity to further vet and criticize, not criticize, but validate
1534340	1536140	his account.
1536140	1541340	So I was asking him specific questions about timing.
1541340	1546620	So at this location, Michael was both shown and told things by this insider.
1546620	1547820	What was he shown?
1547820	1550020	He hasn't told me what he saw there.
1550020	1552660	He said he he signed an NDA.
1552660	1554620	So what was Michael told?
1554620	1560020	Strangely enough, this insider was okay with Michael telling Joey and the greater public
1560020	1562660	about what he was told at this meeting.
1562660	1567820	Now, Joey and I are both a little apprehensive to discuss these points, as we cannot back
1567820	1571260	these up with any evidence, however, it's important to discuss anyways.
1571260	1575980	I feel a little uncomfortable like going through kind of the speculative stuff that this insider
1575980	1581180	has told Michael, because it's nothing I've been able to verify.
1581180	1586060	Well, according to this insider, he is an advocate for disclosure and has been in the
1586060	1588220	program for decades.
1588220	1591140	Remember guys, all of this is speculation.
1591140	1596540	This could very well be purposeful disinformation by this insider or utter nonsense, but I want
1596540	1600060	to talk about these statements due to the existence of the insider and the reality of
1600060	1601060	the meeting.
1601060	1605500	Fortunately, Joey has made a post on Reddit detailing this information, which will be
1605500	1608140	on screen now and in the show notes.
1608140	1614260	This is all content Michael has relayed publicly or given Joey permission to share.
1614260	1619100	Within the USG, there are two groups studying UAP, the blue group and the black group.
1619100	1623220	The blue group consists of programs with proper congressional oversight, Think, Arrow,
1623220	1625380	A-Tip, Blue Book, etc.
1625380	1631140	Black group is an organization founded in the 1940s to reverse engineer NHI tech.
1631140	1636500	The lack of oversight, accountability and endless reach of this black group mirrors almost
1636500	1640340	identically what is spoken about in the Wilson Davis memo.
1640340	1645300	This black group has successfully reverse engineered NHI craft to an unknown degree
1645300	1649540	of success, but utilizes these craft for operations.
1649540	1653700	The flying crafts are considered, quote, boring tech.
1653700	1658140	There are other technologies that are far more exciting and, in the insider's words,
1658140	1660180	utilitarian for humanity.
1660180	1666700	EMP-like weaponry has been developed that can target and disrupt and disable UAP.
1666700	1671860	Crash retrieval programs are able to lure UAP to locations where they are disabled via
1671860	1676020	the EMP weapons and craft and bodies are recovered.
1676020	1679500	Now we get into some of the real woo and troubling stuff.
1679500	1685820	The program recruits people with quote, psionic abilities and quote, referred to as P3, often
1685820	1688220	from third world nations.
1688220	1693540	These individuals are needed to interface with and control NHI tech.
1693540	1697460	Recruits from these third world countries are often bargained with to join the program
1697460	1702980	in exchange for security and safety of their families, likely due to the permanent or semi-permanent
1702980	1706080	isolation of the recruits while in the program.
1706080	1709660	This is the operation Michael stumbled upon in Indonesia.
1709660	1714500	Many recruits actually die in the process of interacting with NHI tech and this is due
1714500	1718020	to heavy drugging to induce a calm meditative state.
1718020	1721700	These recruits are treated like biological equipment.
1721700	1727340	In order to fly some interesting choice of words there, NHI craft, a consciousness connection
1727340	1729180	must be made.
1729180	1734300	A black program pilot cannot fly an NHI craft directly if he does not have the desired psionic
1734300	1735620	abilities mentioned.
1735620	1741340	So the program has devised a method to connect a recruit to a brain interface machine where
1741340	1745340	the pilot controls the machine to control the person's intentions, thus controlling
1745340	1747020	the craft.
1747020	1754020	If true and this is a big if, the implications of this program existing are beyond disturbing.
1754020	1756540	But let's try and keep investigating.
1756540	1758900	What else can Joey tell us about this insider?
1758900	1766860	I do know that this insider is real and I can say that because boy, I don't know how
1766860	1770580	I can publicly acknowledge how I know that.
1770580	1777500	I will say that there are other people who have corroborated the existence of this insider
1777500	1779140	to me personally.
1779140	1789900	I know that he took Michael to this location and so due to what I know this location to
1789900	1798500	be officially, it leads me to believe that this person has quite a bit of authority to
1798500	1804780	be able to bring him to this location in the nature in which he did.
1805300	1814300	My first question is how the heck does anyone get to bring a random person, Michael Herrera?
1814300	1815700	Especially a civilian at the time.
1815700	1816700	For sure.
1816700	1817700	Yeah.
1817700	1818940	That's impossible, right?
1818940	1825340	There's got to be all the security and cross-checking and surveillance of every person who's walking
1825340	1831820	in and out of the place and the way this all went down was just like, holy crap.
1831820	1834380	He literally did that.
1834380	1837060	So what are the implications of that?
1837060	1842540	So I know Michael was taken to this location and I know the insider exists, but I don't
1842540	1845060	know if anything the insider is saying is true.
1845060	1849180	So the insider has provided Michael with a lot of leaks, information about the Black
1849180	1850180	Program.
1850180	1854100	He's specifically involved with the crash retrieval aspect.
1854100	1859220	So the question on my mind, and I'm guessing all of yours too, is why did this insider
1859220	1861780	tell all of this to Michael?
1861780	1866860	If this was a Psyop, why bring Michael all the way to this black site and show him all
1866860	1869260	of this unknown stuff?
1869260	1873940	And even if the insider is lying, this still does not account for Michael's experience
1873940	1875980	seeing the UFO in 2009.
1875980	1879380	That experience is not negated if this is a Psyop.
1879380	1883980	To me, both sides of the coin seem somewhat logical and plausible.
1883980	1890980	I often think back to the story of Paul Benowitz, who in 1989 was driven to insanity by being
1890980	1896060	fed false information about extraterrestrials by the CIA.
1896060	1901360	This is a fascinating story I might cover one day because it's really worth knowing.
1901360	1906860	On the other hand, if this figure is pro-disclosure but does not want to be public, it does make
1906860	1909340	sense for him to use Michael as a vessel.
1909340	1910900	Let's see what Joey thinks.
1910900	1912900	These guys don't want to come out publicly.
1912900	1915460	They have a lot at risk.
1915460	1922220	And personally, they have no interest in being like public figures about this topic.
1922220	1927860	There are allegedly a lot of factions within the program who aren't interested in this
1927860	1936420	becoming disclosed, and so there's personal risk with that as well.
1936420	1943820	And so I think he saw in Michael someone who was already comfortable with that risk of
1943820	1950100	being a whistleblower, and because he had that connection of understanding the operation
1950100	1962420	that Michael had witnessed, felt that he would be a good person to try to reach out to.
1962420	1967060	Something that raises suspicion about The Insider for both Joey and myself is the story
1967060	1968460	of a book.
1968460	1972740	A few weeks after the meeting, The Insider told Michael he was in the process of writing
1972740	1974740	a book under a ghostwriter.
1974740	1979580	The purpose of this book was to hide truth and fiction, similar to Secret Machines by
1979580	1981380	Tom DeLonge.
1981380	1985060	This book is titled Sentinels of Aether.
1985060	1988940	What sticks out to me as concerning here is the book was framed to be corroborating evidence
1988940	1994060	to support Michael's story, however, the connecting threads are thin at best.
1994060	1999660	In fact, this book is about an event that occurred in Mexico in 2004 in which a paramilitary
1999660	2005300	group in the Black Program wipe out an entire JSOC team during an operation.
2005300	2009700	The Black team is described as transporting humans inside shipping containers to a hidden
2009700	2014340	base in a mountain, which is similar to the containers Michael Herrera describes in his
2014340	2015340	encounter.
2015340	2019980	I didn't mention this earlier, but one of the things that Michael had been excited about
2019980	2025300	with this meeting was he was supposedly going to be given some evidence that would support
2025300	2028500	his claims.
2028500	2051860	And the insider actually provided a two-chapter manuscript of the book currently under Dobser
2051860	2055060	Review to remove classified information.
2055060	2060820	In the insider's own words, he is playing a scheme or 4D chess on Dobser.
2060820	2065220	And of course, for those of you who don't know, Dobser is the Defense Office of Pre-Publication
2065220	2067020	and Security Review.
2067020	2070500	This is what David Grush is currently going through with his op-ed right now, so he doesn't
2070500	2072880	divulge any classified information.
2072880	2081900	And he does provide some context as to the sort of scheme that he's trying to play on
2081900	2088580	Dobser where he's intentionally, you know, including certain information that he knows,
2088580	2093820	you know, shouldn't be flagged by Dobser because it's like deep black projects that shouldn't
2093820	2094820	be acknowledged.
2094820	2096660	And he's trying to see if they'll catch it.
2096660	2102580	And it, I don't know, it just sounds, it just sounds a little sketchy, to be honest.
2102580	2109300	In fact, the insider directly quotes, quote, our intention is to put the DoD in a pickle
2109300	2111140	by creating dilemmas.
2111140	2115180	We are strategically taking advantage of the fact they must respond.
2115180	2116180	They don't have a choice.
2116180	2117420	No poker face.
2117420	2123300	Any response will provide us with information slash intelligence and inverse intelligence.
2123300	2128300	One of the other things that Joey has more information on than almost anybody else are
2128300	2133260	the thoughts and words of Michael's fellow platoon members who were with him in Indonesia
2133260	2134980	in 2009.
2134980	2139460	According to the original Daily Mail article that was written on Herrera, the other four
2139460	2143820	or five Marines in Herrera's platoon were too scared to come forward.
2143820	2149060	Bar one text message that read, quote, Hey man, this is asking too much of me.
2149060	2150740	It's not worth the risk.
2150740	2155260	My family and military career far exceed anything you are asking of me.
2155260	2158180	It's not worth my life or jeopardizing my family.
2158180	2161500	I know we go back, but this is asking too much.
2161500	2164860	You need to get out of whatever you are in and don't get me involved.
2164860	2172620	So I've talked to a handful of people who were in his platoon and were on that mission,
2172620	2173620	on that ship.
2173620	2180860	I would say not the UFO mission, the alleged UFO mission, but I'll say the Indonesia relief
2180860	2182700	effort mission or operation.
2182700	2189140	I will say that out of those people that I have spoken to, all of them believe Michael
2189140	2195220	is lying, except for, well, except for one.
2195220	2203420	There's one person that I've reached out to and asked for permission to ask some questions
2203420	2204420	about it.
2204420	2209300	And he just said, no, thank you and leave my name out of everything.
2209300	2212580	But everyone else thinks Michael is lying.
2212580	2218220	But the thing that's interesting is, you know, once I get into conversation with these people,
2218220	2226100	they quickly reveal that, you know, because someone says very strongly, I know he's lying.
2226100	2232100	My follow-up question is, oh, so you were boots on the ground with him in Indonesia?
2232100	2237060	And their reply is, well, no, I was in a different squad or oh, no, I was, I was, I stayed on
2237060	2238060	the ship.
2238060	2239060	I didn't leave the ship.
2239060	2243740	And so immediately I'm like, well, you can't possibly know he's lying because you weren't
2243740	2244740	there.
2244740	2246940	Like how can you say you know he's lying?
2246940	2252140	So, you know, that was really disappointing to hear.
2252140	2257700	However, I still, I still maintained conversations with these people because they did, you know,
2257700	2263780	certain people provided some, you know, personal photographs that I was able to, you know, there
2263780	2270660	was nothing crazy in the photographs, but it did prove that they were in, you know, the
2270660	2274420	Taming Airport where the coordination efforts were happening.
2274580	2281100	There's one person who I do find very credible who speaks against Michael.
2281100	2289660	I'll just say his first name, his name's Nathan, and he was Michael's team leader.
2289660	2297100	And he provided, so I've had several, you know, text conversations with him, and he
2297100	2308380	provided a photograph that he alleges shows Michael and another Marine on a helicopter.
2308380	2312060	And he says they're all being flown into Indonesia.
2312060	2314340	They don't have rifles, right?
2314340	2319460	This photograph is important because if it is proven to be Michael, it kind of shows
2319460	2326260	that he's lying about something, you know, or, you know, most of the story gets kind
2326260	2331460	of discredited because, you know, the big part of Michael's story was he had rifles
2331460	2338220	and, you know, he was with different people.
2338220	2342460	So Michael, you know, I did share that photograph with Michael.
2342460	2343620	I didn't give him any contacts.
2343620	2347980	I just said, do you know who's in this photograph?
2347980	2350860	And he provided two names.
2350860	2356220	And, you know, then I explained, you know, that the allegations that one of one of the
2356220	2360900	people is him and, and he denies it, he very strongly denies it.
2360900	2367380	And what's interesting to me to kind of play towards Michael in a way, let's say Nathan's
2367380	2373820	telling the truth, let's say Michael did fly in with him without rifles.
2373820	2378140	And let's say Michael was on that flight, right?
2378140	2382500	What that would mean if he is lying about this UFO thing?
2382500	2388740	That means he was thinking, let me, let me make up a story about a UFO, but also let
2388740	2397620	me lie in about a mission I know I went on with my squad, even though he knows there
2397620	2402300	were witnesses and he knows, you know, his photo is being taken.
2402300	2403580	That just doesn't make any sense to me.
2403580	2408060	Like why would he, like he could have very easily just said, yeah, that is me in the
2408060	2413580	photograph, but I also took a different flight in later on or earlier in the day.
2413580	2417580	You know, he could have made it so he could have just acknowledged that both things are
2417580	2422500	true and it would have totally negated that photographic evidence.
2422500	2427780	The question of rifles or lack thereof in Nathan's alleged photograph is crucial.
2427780	2433340	Since Indonesia 2009 was a humanitarian mission, Marines were not supposed to be equipped with
2433340	2434540	rifles.
2434540	2438580	As I stated earlier, and what was actually confirmed to Joey by all the Marines he spoke
2438580	2444620	to, the first wave of Marines in Indonesia were in fact armed, but subsequent deployments
2444620	2446780	were not due to bad optics.
2446780	2450900	Allegedly, an Air Force Colonel yelled at the Marines and ordered them to stop utilizing
2450900	2452740	rifles.
2452740	2457100	And now the reason why probably half of you are watching this video with a renewed interest
2457100	2462020	in Michael Herrera, the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1.
2462020	2468060	In this report, Michael Herrera is all but named as somebody who testified to Arrow stating
2468060	2469060	quote,
2469060	2474740	An interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said in that 2009, while participating
2474740	2480100	in a humanitarian and security mission in a foreign country, he encountered U.S. special
2480100	2485100	forces loading containers onto a large extraterrestrial spacecraft.
2485100	2489220	And guys, I probably don't need to explain this to you, but Arrow Historical Report Volume
2489220	2492980	1 is not the most accurate report we've ever seen.
2492980	2499220	In fact, in this two to three sentence summary of Michael Herrera, there are two factual inaccuracies.
2499220	2503740	One, Michael never claimed he encountered U.S. special forces.
2503740	2508180	What he said was he encountered men with American dialects.
2508180	2515540	With American gear, but no rank, no insignia, no identifiers to where they belonged.
2515540	2521860	And two, Herrera said, even from his first statement, he thought the craft he saw was
2521860	2525300	human reverse engineered, not extraterrestrial.
2525300	2528780	Is this just awful writing or purposeful disinformation?
2528780	2531460	I lean more towards purposeful.
2531460	2536700	I think this is so bogus and just in a two sentence summary, getting so many facts wrong.
2536700	2542380	In my opinion, this sort of misreporting is on purpose and a symptom of the larger sickness
2542380	2544260	that is this report.
2544260	2548300	And I just want to touch on what seems to be a big misconception in the UAP community
2548300	2550720	on Twitter and Reddit at the moment.
2550720	2555780	On page 32, under the section, the UAP with peculiar characteristics refers to an authentic
2555780	2558500	non-UAP related SAP.
2558500	2563580	Some people are confusing this statement as describing Michael Herrera.
2563580	2567740	In the statement, it says, Arrow was able to correlate this account with an authentic
2567740	2572860	USG program because the interviewee was able to provide a relatively precise time and location.
2572860	2577100	As first pointed out to me by Joey, Michael narrowed down the timing of the event to within
2577100	2580940	a couple days, but he did not know the precise time.
2580940	2586020	And Michael did not know the exact location of the landing zone in Indonesia.
2586020	2592780	In the same section, whatever person was writing this error report stated that the seemingly
2592780	2597380	strange characteristics reported by the interviewee matched closely with the platform's characteristics
2597380	2600780	which was being tested at a military facility in the timeframe.
2600780	2602240	The interviewee was there.
2602240	2607160	But again, as Joey points out, Michael's encounter occurred in a remote part of the
2607160	2611080	jungle in Indonesia, not a military facility.
2611080	2615640	What was massively vindicating to Joey and something that made him place more trust in
2615640	2621160	Michael, and he even relayed this to me months before the Arrow Historical Report Volume
2621160	2626960	1, Michael had actually told Joey and provided him proof that he had testified to Arrow.
2626960	2630960	He said that they didn't record his testimony like they did.
2630960	2636400	They weren't actually like electronically recording his testimony.
2636400	2642800	There were just people in a skiff and some of them had notepads and were just like taking
2642800	2644320	notes occasionally.
2644320	2653640	So the summary of his testimony in the report could literally just be the result of poor
2653640	2663640	note-taking and I am perfectly comfortable with accusing them of doing this intentionally
2663640	2672280	because it certainly seems like something that they were trying to prevent as much of
2672280	2683520	a paper trail as possible and leaving a lot of the records up to interpretation.
2683520	2687160	I think that was 100% intentional.
2687160	2696720	So I don't know if it was malicious misquoting of Michael or just literally poor note-taking
2696720	2703240	and someone read someone else's notes and summarized and misinterpreted or whatever.
2703240	2709000	Did he testify to Dr. Kirkpatrick or was it just Arrow employees?
2709000	2713680	He says it was directly to Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the room.
2713680	2718920	But another thing that I'll mention as well, something that I kind of caught was speaking
2718920	2727000	of that statute that would provide penalties to anyone who lies, I noticed that Arrow was
2727000	2734760	extremely careful in their report not to accuse a single whistleblower of lying or misleading.
2734760	2746160	They emphasized how accepting they are of the fact that these whistleblowers believe
2746160	2750080	what they're telling Arrow.
2750080	2752560	And again, I think that was incredibly intentional.
2752560	2758720	It was really like the first opening statement in the report.
2758720	2762800	If you really highlight the key words there, it's literally all about belief.
2762840	2768760	I'm just emphasizing belief and everyone's entitled to their belief and we can't criticize
2768760	2772480	or hold it against anyone if they believe something.
2772480	2779560	And that was intentional so that nobody could ... I previously asserted that Arrow would
2779560	2783520	be forced to prosecute if they lied, but that's not really the case.
2783520	2786920	I kind of misspoke there really.
2786920	2793080	I think it would still would have made an opportunity for other lawyers or organizations
2793080	2801600	to press charges against whistleblowers if they had lied and Arrow would be kind of
2801600	2805800	in a position potentially to provide evidence that supports that assertion.
2805800	2814520	So they wanted to make sure to avoid that at all costs and that's why they did that.
2814520	2819160	Of course, I was fascinated to know if Michael had spoken to any other whistleblowers or
2819160	2821320	people behind the scenes.
2821320	2826040	While Joey understandably couldn't comment, he did tell me something interesting that
2826040	2827880	kind of made me jump for joy.
2827880	2836480	I do know that he has spoken to Jonathan Weighant, which was pretty interesting because they
2836480	2842040	did have sort of similar experiences.
2842040	2847360	So yeah, so that was really cool to think that Jonathan kind of had gotten the chance
2847360	2851800	to speak with someone else that had a similar experience.
2851800	2857180	I personally believe it is probable that Michael and Weighant encountered the same insider
2857180	2859120	paramilitary group.
2859120	2863600	Too many similarities to men with American dialects and all black gear that appear to
2863600	2865960	have highly skilled backgrounds.
2865960	2871240	Of course, in Weighant's case, he did specifically see men in DOE rain jackets, which allowed
2871240	2874920	me to conclude that these are likely a DOE NES team.
2874920	2879560	Again watch that analysis in my Marines video and then listen back to Michael's testimony
2879560	2882040	and cross reference the two teams.
2882040	2886640	And lastly guys, I kind of wanted to touch on some of the criticism that Joey has received.
2886640	2892560	He has received so much support for his investigation, but also a lot of hate online.
2892560	2895920	People calling him Michael's shill, people calling him Michael's publicist, or even
2895920	2898120	Michael under a pseudonym.
2898120	2902760	And understandably so, he's received some flak for receiving evidence, yet not making
2902760	2904120	it public.
2904120	2905640	Let's see what he has to say.
2905640	2908920	I'm in no way his publicist.
2908920	2917160	Yeah, I there's a few exceptions to that where there there were people that I felt would
2917160	2921120	be good people to interview him.
2921120	2922580	One of them is Chris Leto.
2922580	2927200	So that was a case where I reached out to Chris and kind of did made the first contact
2927200	2928800	and then introduced him.
2928800	2937600	I just hope people will be open to continuing to just follow, you know, more as as the story
2937600	2942400	unfolds because it's a very, it's a very interesting case because you not only do you have this
2942400	2948840	historical event that happened in 2009 that still has a ton of data that is yet to be
2948840	2950640	uncovered.
2950640	2955280	Even by myself, you know, yes, there's things that I do have privately that I can't share,
2955280	2961160	but there's also, you know, other data that hasn't been uncovered by myself or anyone.
2961160	2965560	But now we have this kind of current thing that's unfolding as we speak.
2965560	2972200	I mean, there are there are things happening right now behind the scenes as we speak.
2972200	2977480	So I think I think it's incredibly interesting and worth paying attention to.
2977480	2982920	And you know, no one has to make a decision about whether they think it's true or false
2982920	2983920	at this point.
2984040	2990920	I've been taking this a lot more seriously than I ever did previously, and I am giving
2990920	2998080	the benefit of the doubt to the other people involved behind the scenes.
2998080	3001840	And I'm and I am taking them very seriously.
3001840	3011280	And I'm respecting anybody's request for me not to reveal certain information because
3011360	3013120	that's that's just the right thing to do.
3013120	3014680	And people criticize me.
3014680	3018960	And it's and it it kills me because I totally understand the criticism.
3018960	3025920	I can't even argue the criticism because I did make the decision to kind of have this
3025920	3032600	compromise where I'd reach out to people like yourself and other, you know, podcasters and
3032600	3040520	journalists and people who I trust and, you know, reveal my identity, you know, you and
3040640	3044440	I, we had a we've we've had video calls, you've seen my face, you know, who I am.
3045280	3050200	And I've shared some information with you that backs up some of my evidence of or, you
3050200	3054160	know, shared some of my evidence that backs up my opinions on certain things.
3054560	3060160	And so really, as the best compromise I could come up with, you know, for now, I do hope
3060160	3065040	to get to a point where I can be public and share more evidence.
3065920	3070200	But for right now, that that was kind of the best compromise I could come up with.
3071080	3075400	And one last thing I'd like to touch on is the connection between Michael Herrera and
3075400	3076200	Stephen Greer.
3076840	3081400	I've touched upon this in almost every single one of my videos where there is a whistleblower,
3082040	3084440	even my Marines video because of Jonathan Wagon.
3084880	3087640	So if you're interested to hear more, go check any of those out.
3088440	3092200	But I think it's important to start separating the whistleblowers from Dr.
3092200	3095400	Greer. It's no surprise I have my problems with Dr.
3095400	3100960	Greer, but I'm trying to take an approach where I will individually vet whistleblowers
3100960	3103040	and people separate from Greer.
3103480	3107160	I see a lot of people saying that these two are in cahoots, which is just blatantly not
3107160	3110960	true. In fact, Michael himself has said that Dr.
3110960	3114800	Greer has embellished or purposefully lied about details of his story.
3115880	3118040	There's been some interviews that Dr.
3118040	3121960	Greer has done and everything like that, where he's told people that they put guns
3121960	3123640	right to our head. That wasn't the case.
3123880	3130040	These guys were at a standoff distance because it's easier to go like this than actually be
3130040	3133720	at a standoff distance and try to rush somebody who has had a good distance that can sight in
3133720	3134360	and just shoot you.
3135480	3137400	So we need to understand that Dr.
3137400	3142520	Greer is probably one of the only avenues whistleblowers have to come forward that they know of
3142520	3147480	before David Grush. Hopefully things change in the future and people start pursuing the avenues
3147480	3152120	of Grush or maybe Carl Nell or maybe if there's some changes arrow.
3152680	3156600	But it's important to kind of separate Herrera from Greer.
3177880	3183080	I would like to thank him for trusting me with some of the more sensitive evidence regarding
3183080	3188600	Herrera. This case is ongoing and I don't imagine there's going to be just one follow-up video
3188600	3194280	he and I make to this. Michael Herrera's case has almost consumed me of late.
3195160	3200200	I think about it all the time. I studied all the time and I talk to Joey about it all the time.
3201080	3205560	So this case is so fascinating to me. I can't believe I initially brushed it off by buying
3205560	3211480	into the Greer hate or buying into some of the kind of nonsensical thoughts of just diminishing
3211480	3216200	his testimony and thinking he's fully because of some details that seem odd at first when
3216200	3222520	hearing about his story. I am still torn on the insider in terms of is this guy conducting a
3222520	3228600	psyop or telling Michael real information. I just don't have enough evidence right now to know.
3229800	3234600	But what do you guys think after hearing some more of this video and hearing from Joey,
3234600	3240040	do you guys believe more in Michael or less? Has his credibility increased or decreased in
3240040	3244200	your eyes? I'd love to hear from you guys because this case is so fascinating to me.
