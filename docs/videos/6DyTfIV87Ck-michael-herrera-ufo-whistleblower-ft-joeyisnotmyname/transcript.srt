1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
With something that stuck out so well, it's always going to be basically imprisoned in

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,680
my mind for the rest of my life, and it has been for 14 years.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,760
You look down into the valley, and there's a clearing with a UAP just sitting there.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Sitting there rotating clockwise, and that's in transition this color spectrum, I was telling

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
you too.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,320
So as far as from a distance, yes, that looks very accurate to what I saw.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,360
Rogue military force, if you will.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,280
The most concerning thing about this is they all had American dialects.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,640
They had American gear.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
They had OTVs, black, they had black camouflage.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
They had very similar setups to what we had, but more high speed, something what you would

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,840
see special operation groups these days have.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,080
They had no insignias on.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,800
And that's what I thought it was it.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,760
I thought they were going to smoke us, you know, and they kept saying that, you know,

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,760
we can kill you right now, you know, as this is.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,840
At the start of the year, I made a video titled The Marines Who Got Too Close to UFOs, where

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
I talked about two whistleblower testimonies of men who encountered UAP throughout their

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,320
military service in the USMC.

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
And this included Jonathan Wagan, and of course, Michael Herrera.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,200
And guys, I'll admit my biases.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,720
While I was really supportive of Jonathan Wagan and found his story to be credible, I was

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,120
really dismissive of Herrera.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Now for Michael Herrera, I'm torn on his story.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,360
I just I'm not sure about that.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,440
This all changed when Redditor and now my good friend, Joey is not my name, reached out to

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,280
me and asked if I was the creator of this video.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,400
Joey told me that he had been investigating Michael deeply and that he and him had actually

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
established a relationship and talked weekly.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,880
I even left a paper trail with certain people, including Joey is not my name.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,360
And there's been a person who has helped with that, Joey, that's not my name.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
If you're watching this, thank you for your help as more of a person who has broad attention

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,600
to detail in a lot of things, which is remarkable.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,680
His Reddit handle is Joey is not my name.

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,000
And finally, he told me that he had enough evidence to attest to the fact that Michael

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,200
met a man, an insider in the black reverse engineering program.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,920
This brief exchange messages led to a fast friendship between Joey and myself.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,400
And for months, actually, he and I have been talking every day on messaging, video calls

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,640
and phone calls discussing Michael's case.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,880
And throughout this time, he has shown me some of the astonishing evidence to both support

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,920
Michael's claims of his experience in Indonesia and his experience meeting an insider in the

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,120
black reverse engineering programs.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,600
So today, guys, I am thrilled to tell you that I actually have my good friend, Joey is not

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,440
my name on the show, to talk about his experience investigating Herrera's case and discuss some

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,200
of the evidence he's actually found to corroborate Michael.

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,440
If you've never heard of Michael Herrera, I'd be shocked, especially after so much

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,760
renewed interest in his encounter, after being all but named in the abomination that is the

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Arrow Historical Report Volume 1.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,080
But for those of you who don't know, or may need a quick refresher, let's briefly summarize

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,840
Michael's UFO whistleblower encounter.

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,080
And guys, please note, as I talk about Michael's testimony, I will be recounting it as fact,

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
as told by Michael.

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,000
The reality is, there is still no way we can prove with evidence that Michael encountered

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,840
this UFO in the jungles of Indonesia.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,520
But we can prove with fact some of the context around Michael's story, such as the military

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,320
mission in Indonesia and the relief effort by the USAF and Marines.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,320
In the summer of 2023, Stephen Greer's National Press Club event featured an array of whistleblower

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,200
individuals, ranging from credible to somewhat dubious.

59
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,840
One of these men was a USMC vet who seemed emboldened to break his 14-year silence, yet

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,560
nervous to reveal himself to the public.

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,000
It was here Michael Herrera first told his story to the world.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,160
In 2009, 2nd Battalion 5th Marine Michael Herrera, at this time a 20-year-old saw gunner,

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,080
was called into Indonesia for a human relief aid mission after the devastating Sumatra

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,200
earthquake in Tsunami.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,560
Michael was stationed on the USS Denver, which is oddly enough the name of both of our hometowns.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,080
This was the only ship routed to the west coast of Indonesia from the US 7th Fleet.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,600
In October of 2009, Herrera's unit was informed they would be providing security to aid in

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,360
the delivery of food and medical supplies, and it's crucial to note, although humanitarian

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,160
missions generally do not see soldiers equipped with weapons, the 1st Marines reportedly were,

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,600
and in this case, M16A4s due to the heavy presence of terrorist training in the area.

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,360
Herrera's team arrived near Pandang from CH-53 Helos at a hasty LZ, where the team

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,120
pushed to a high ground for reconnaissance purposes, and it's worth noting and rightfully

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,400
one of the biggest points of contention surrounding Michael's testimony, Herrera states his team

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,920
was not equipped with radio comms, and Michael himself states this was highly abnormal.

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,160
The team trekked up a ridge at an elevation of roughly 300 meters.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Herrera had on him a Panasonic camera and was taking images of the surrounding area.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,960
Once the Marines reached the high point of the ridge, something quote, stuck out like

78
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,900
a sore thumb, end quote, against the jungle terrain.

79
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,220
There was a craft rotating just above the tree line, transitioning colors between a

80
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,660
light matte gray and a dark matte black.

81
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,020
Perplexed, the team decided to approach and investigate, and it's key to note, Michael

82
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,300
did in fact take pictures of the craft with the camera he stored in his spent magazine

83
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,820
pouch.

84
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,980
Reaching down the slope, the USMC team was about 150 meters from the craft.

85
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,780
It was from here Michael estimated the craft to be 300 feet in diameter.

86
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,660
It was octagonal in shape, rotating clockwise with Vantablack exterior panels and a pyramid

87
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,300
type shape on top.

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:24,460
The craft let off an audible hum, almost like a guitar amp.

89
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,700
The craft floated 15-20 feet above the ground, surrounded by a quote, rogue military force.

90
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,620
What was astounding is these men featured American dialects, American gear, and similar

91
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,240
setups the Marines had but with much better equipment.

92
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,540
These men had no rank, no insignia.

93
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,340
Eight of the men engaged the Marines, directing their weapons at the soldiers and flipping

94
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,500
off the weapon safeties, screaming at the Marines, asking what they were doing there,

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
and threatening their lives.

96
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Terrified the Marines complied, they were padded down and stripped of their weapons.

97
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,980
The rogue operators even knew to take the Marines military IDs out of their left breast

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,780
pocket, where they snapped pictures of Herrera and his fellow Marines identifications.

99
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,900
During this time, Michael occasionally shifted his glance back to the large UFO, where four

100
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,780
F-350s sat with weapon cases and containers with an oxygen or humidity control unit which

101
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,940
held what Michael would later come to learn were human beings.

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,060
The F-350s loaded the supplies onto a platform below the craft.

103
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,900
When the platform itself rose from the ground, connected with the craft, and the two connected

104
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:46,500
pieces shot off westward instantaneously, no rotor wash, no exhaust, no sonic boom, none

105
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,900
of the surrounding vegetation was disturbed in any way.

106
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,460
When Marines were told to turn around, Michael thought that this was it, they were dead.

107
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,900
Until the operators began reloading the soldiers' equipment and magazines back onto their persons.

108
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,860
Escorting the Marines back up to the slopes, the operators told Michael and his fellow

109
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,100
soldiers they were not allowed to look back or talk about what they had seen.

110
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Breaking the hillside, the Marines ran back to the LZ, where a resident gunnery sergeant

111
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,180
grew furious at the non-combat-effective Marines.

112
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,780
Flying back to the USS Denver, an admiral debriefed the team, and a few days later while

113
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,660
on leave, the battery and SD card to Michael's camera were taken, along with the fellow Marine

114
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,420
cell phones.

115
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,900
And finally, when the USS Denver tracked back to Okinawa, a man in use-half blues with no

116
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,340
name tag, pulled Michael into his office, where he told him to never tell anybody of

117
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,660
his encounter, regardless of chain of command, discussing the event would lead to imprisonment

118
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,340
or death.

119
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:54,020
Michael was then forced to sign an NDA to never speak about the experience.

120
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:05,180
And what really triggered me into being motivated to look into the case myself was hearing all

121
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:13,500
of the negative reaction towards him for reasons that I felt were really flimsy.

122
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:21,540
People were criticizing him because he said they didn't have radios, or because he mislabeled

123
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
the name of a rifle or something.

124
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:31,940
And I just thought that was pretty absurd to completely dismiss a whistleblower when you're

125
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,180
literally sitting here considering a story about a 300-foot UFO, but because they didn't

126
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,300
have a radio, that's too unbelievable for you, so let's just dismiss the whole thing.

127
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:54,300
If the UFO community did not have the open-mindedness and patience and space to provide a whistleblower

128
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:02,940
to give time to investigate and vet the story, and if we were just going to shoot them down

129
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,460
immediately for really lame reasons, how are we going to expect the general public to take

130
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,580
this seriously if we can't even give it a chance?

131
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,780
The other thing was it dawned on me, this is a military operation and humanitarian operation,

132
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:30,940
so there's a ton of photojournalism, journalists, military reports and assessments that were

133
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,860
done all around this operation.

134
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,020
So I saw that as a great opportunity to begin digging into the details to see if I could

135
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,340
find any conflicts with Michael's testimony.

136
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:52,420
And I ended up finding the opposite, that I was corroborating everything that I could

137
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,620
find corroborated what he was saying.

138
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,900
Now obviously that doesn't prove he saw a UFO, but it does corroborate all of the details

139
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,300
around that operation that he was on.

140
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:12,500
And so I made a post on Reddit kind of detailing those things that I found.

141
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Joey's first Reddit post titled Verifying the Events Around Michael Herrera's UFO Encounter

142
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,580
Part 1, saw to confirm all the little bits and pieces of the military operation in 2009.

143
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,900
Logically, if Michael could be found to be lying about any detail regarding the humanitarian

144
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,180
mission, his whole testimony could be thrown out the window as, another UFO want to be.

145
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,140
Joey provided documentable evidence to support all of the context Michael provided including,

146
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,820
the USS Denver was the sole ship assigned to support Indonesian military efforts, regardless

147
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,300
of Michael finding this strange.

148
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,340
The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit was present at this operation.

149
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,740
CH-53 Super Stallion choppers were used to deliver aid.

150
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,620
And finally, the confirmation of hasty LZs, threw a blog post which detailed efforts done

151
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,220
by the US forces to deliver supplies to critical and remote areas.

152
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,260
Of course, none of this actually proves that Michael saw a UFO lost in service, but this

153
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,580
post does confirm key smaller elements of his story, including accurately depicting the

154
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,940
military op in Indonesia.

155
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,140
Joey includes a call to action asking Michael to reach out for further investigation.

156
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:36,780
So my plan was to do a part two where I would, I wanted to figure out where the landing zone

157
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
was.

158
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,020
I thought if I could reach out to Michael and we could work together to figure out where

159
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,900
the landing zone was, I have the 3D modeling background.

160
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,420
So what I wanted to do was import that terrain into, you know, some 3D modeling software

161
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:00,740
and be able to perform like additional analysis to cross check his estimates of distances

162
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,700
and heights and scales of things.

163
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:11,740
And I also thought it was important to illustrate the distances that are involved in this encounter

164
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,140
because the landing zone was almost 700 or 800 meters away from where the craft was sighted

165
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,380
with a hill in between in the middle of jungle.

166
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,660
And so that was really my only thought for reaching out to Michael.

167
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:34,140
I had no idea it was going to, you know, kind of spiral, spiral much deeper into what it

168
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,140
has.

169
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,580
I mean, how, how rare is it that we get any sort of testimony that isn't, that's literally

170
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,100
just it, you know, most times it's literally just testimony.

171
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,980
It's just someone's verbal account of what happened.

172
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,980
There's no evidence.

173
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
There's no nothing.

174
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:58,580
So here we have a military operation that has, you know, aerial surveys being conducted.

175
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm sure there's plenty of satellite imagery, you know, that exists and just all of the

176
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,220
different records that kind of track the movements of things.

177
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,100
You know, it just that reason alone seems like a very exciting case to dig into where

178
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,740
you have a lot of opportunity to uncover data.

179
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,140
Literally that same day that I emailed him.

180
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
He called me that night.

181
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:28,300
We spoke for about a half hour and, you know, I got the sense that he respected the amount

182
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,980
of effort I put into that post and just the, you know, just putting in the work.

183
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,660
I have a feeling it was part of why he started to trust me and respect me moving forward.

184
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,500
You know, he started trusting me with, with certain sensitive information that, that did

185
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,300
help, you know, back up some of his, some of his claims, circumstantially, I'll say.

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,540
Then he started telling me more about this insider.

187
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,460
The discussion around this program insider who met with and disclosed leaks to Michael

188
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,860
is where some followers of this case, including myself, justifiably raised red flags and heightened

189
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,500
their skepticism.

190
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,600
But who is this insider and for what reason did he meet with Michael?

191
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,420
What can Joey tell us about this meeting and how can he prove Michael was flown out to

192
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,020
a secure facility to meet with this shadowy figure?

193
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,520
And also do not worry when we get to the actual contents of the meeting, we will of course

194
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,940
discuss all of the leaks that were told to Michael by this insider.

195
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,260
Michael's first encounter with this insider was actually mentioned on his first public

196
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,540
appearance on Stephen Greer's national press club panel, which come to find out through

197
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,180
recent revelations from yesterday from somebody who came forward to Dr. Greer.

198
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,700
I don't know who they are, but what they had told him and what he has told me is that

199
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,660
this gentleman knows exactly what these were used for because they had like a cylinder on

200
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,300
the front, which is either for oxygen or what I have hypothesized was for vacuum sealing,

201
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,580
which believed me to suspect that they were smuggling narcotics or drugs.

202
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,660
Come to find out it's more disturbing than that.

203
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,780
This gentleman has first hand account with this and says that it was for people.

204
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,300
This insider wanted to meet Michael in person.

205
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,860
And so he asked Dr. Greer to make the connection.

206
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,740
And so, you know, he introduced the two or passed along phone numbers or whatever.

207
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,140
And so Michael's telling me all this, you know, that this this insider wants to meet

208
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,100
him and all this stuff.

209
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,820
And I found it very suspicious, you know, I found it very strange that not only would

210
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:44,420
he have this really incredible story about seeing a UFO in Indonesia, a huge 300 foot

211
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,500
UFO, which is is pretty unique.

212
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
I don't know.

213
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,820
I personally don't know of too many stories like that that big.

214
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,820
And now you're telling me that that literally an insider wants to meet you like, come on,

215
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,420
this is, you know, this is pretty outrageous, you know, how did how did Michael react when

216
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,900
he was approached by the insider?

217
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,660
Was he excited?

218
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,580
Was he skeptical?

219
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,460
Was he possibly worried for his safety?

220
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:17,260
Yeah, he was, he was very, he, he, I mean, the last time, if you think about it, like

221
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,140
the last time he's interacted with any of these people, they had guns pointed at him

222
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,140
and, you know, we're threatening to kill him and stuff.

223
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,900
And so now here's someone, you know, allegedly associated with that.

224
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:37,380
And, but he just felt like if he wants to move this forward, he's got to, he's got to

225
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,500
take the chance and do it.

226
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:49,100
And for me, you know, at the time, this was pretty early on in my interactions with Michael.

227
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,260
And I didn't feel like I had the sort of relationship with him where I could, you know, ask

228
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,500
questions or provide advice or anything like that.

229
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,420
You know, I was basically just kind of respectfully, you know, taking information from him that

230
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,380
he felt comfortable sharing with me.

231
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,100
But I wanted to scream at him and say, dude, like, are you crazy?

232
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,820
And mind you, I went back and forth constantly through this period where I would allow myself

233
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,220
to pretend it's all real and like, you know, let myself just kind of sit there for a minute

234
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,540
and be like, all right, let's say this is all real, holy crap, this is, he's crazy.

235
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,100
Like he can't go and meet this guy, he's going to kill him, you know.

236
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,860
And then there were times where I would be feeling the opposite and being like, okay,

237
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,820
this is, this is clearly like a setup and he's telling me stuff that he's telling me

238
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
is sensitive.

239
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,100
But in reality, it's, he wants me to leak it, but he's telling me not to.

240
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,980
It's like reverse psychology or something.

241
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,580
You know, I need to be really cautious here.

242
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:01,500
And so that was, that was what was going through my mind at the time and it was very much back

243
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,660
and forth.

244
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:08,220
But I also felt like I was in a pretty good position because this wasn't anything I had

245
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,620
to take action on.

246
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,180
I had reached out to him to kind of like try to figure out what the LZ was and then it kind

247
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,260
of just snowballed into this other thing.

248
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,020
But I felt like I was in a great position because there was really no risk or harm in

249
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:29,660
me just letting things play out and see what happens, you know, Joey was rightfully extremely

250
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:36,540
confused and skeptical as to why Michael confided so much information to him about the insider

251
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,260
in the meeting time, date and location.

252
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,820
It was then Joey actually realized Michael was using him as a dead man switch.

253
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,140
Michael feared what might happen to him being taken out to an unfamiliar location by unfamiliar

254
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,140
people.

255
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,660
And in case he was in fact killed, Joey should release any and all information he had.

256
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,100
That was what made me the most suspicious because it was like he was trusting me with

257
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,700
information without any real justification.

258
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,260
And then I realized, you know, that he was going out to meet this guy and I got the feeling

259
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,060
that he was, you know, telling me this information in case something happened to him.

260
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:23,300
And I called him out on it and told and, you know, he basically said like, yeah, I, you

261
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,380
know, if something happens to me while I'm out there, you know, I want you to release

262
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,300
all this information.

263
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,340
I'm very happy that Joey brought this next point up as he has never actually talked about

264
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,740
this publicly.

265
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,580
The day before the meeting, Joey and Michael had a conversation about the meeting and Joey

266
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,700
recorded this conversation without Michael's knowledge.

267
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:50,860
I called Michael and had a conversation with him about the meeting and I recorded it without

268
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,780
his knowledge.

269
00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:03,580
And I did that because I felt like I needed proof in case I did need to, in case something

270
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,740
did happen to him and, and I couldn't get in touch with him and I needed to reach out

271
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,300
to someone to prove that, yes, I'm in touch with Michael and these are the things he's

272
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,260
told me and now I can't get ahold of him.

273
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,500
I didn't think anyone would believe me unless I had some sort of proof that I was talking

274
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
to him.

275
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
So I recorded that.

276
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I think I actually shared that with you.

277
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Hey, Michael.

278
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Hey, what's up?

279
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,780
I had a little time before I have to kick off this meeting here at 9.30.

280
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Oh, okay.

281
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Yeah.

282
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,940
Well, I just, you know, first of all, wanted to check in with you to see how you're, how

283
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
you're doing, how you're feeling.

284
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
Good.

285
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,460
I had a meeting with these guys so I'm kind of, you know, I'm nervous about a little apprehensive,

286
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,420
but if this is going to get carried any further than I need to, you know, I need to speak to

287
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
the horse's mouth.

288
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
So speak.

289
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,940
So I've, I just, you know, it is what it is at this point, but it's fucking crazy.

290
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
Yeah.

291
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
I'm, yeah.

292
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
I just kind of checking in.

293
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,740
I mean, like, geez.

294
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,180
So everything's basically all set for the meeting.

295
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Yeah.

296
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Tomorrow for tomorrow.

297
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,180
So, so I arrived there around a clock.

298
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Yeah.

299
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
They're time.

300
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,180
And then there's, they're picking me up with picking me up.

301
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,420
They got a, they're putting me in and then I'm going to some, apparently there's a facility

302
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,340
out and that they're taking me to and then like somewhere to go see some things.

303
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,980
So I don't know what that entails, but yeah.

304
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Yeah.

305
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Okay.

306
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,180
And then you're going to touch base with me after, afterwards at some point.

307
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Yeah.

308
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,180
Okay.

309
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
All right, Michael.

310
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Well, be safe.

311
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,380
My friend and look forward to touching base with you when you get back.

312
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Roger that, man.

313
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Thank you for being involved with this too.

314
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,580
And, you know, I'm glad that you're checking up on me.

315
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Cool.

316
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
You know, it's great.

317
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,100
So yeah, as soon as I get more information, if I'm able to release some things after this

318
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,980
meeting, then I'll let you know.

319
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Okay.

320
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Sounds good.

321
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
All right, buddy.

322
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Bye.

323
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,020
What stood out to me most about this conversation was the fear in Michael's voice.

324
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,380
He sounded scared like he didn't know what was going to happen to him.

325
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:19,420
And yes, he did provide specific details and also Joey did tell Michael about this recording

326
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
later on.

327
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,100
So please don't hold that against him.

328
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,980
Michael knows, but using this information provided by Michael, Joey was able to verify

329
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,660
many of the details that Michael claimed, think tracking flight records and such.

330
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,660
There's other evidence that I can't share publicly.

331
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:42,500
I think I did, I did share that, like some censored, a censored version of that evidence

332
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,540
with you and guys, I have seen a lot of people dismiss or get on Joey's case for not sharing

333
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,860
this evidence.

334
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,740
He has in fact shown me a censored version of this evidence.

335
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,780
And if Joey is telling the truth, which I believe he is, and showing me an undocked

336
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,980
version of this evidence, I can say with a high degree of certainty that this meeting

337
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,820
did in fact take place.

338
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,460
This isn't to say anything about what the insider showed or told Michael.

339
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,100
I can't comment on that legitimacy nor can Joey, we don't know.

340
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,980
The evidence, of course, is not mine to share or to an extent, even Joey's.

341
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,980
There is a larger behind the scenes investigation here being conducted that if shared publicly

342
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,540
could compromise the investigation, or at the very least, make it somewhat hairy.

343
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,980
I personally hope that the finer details of this investigation and Joey's evidence will

344
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,420
come to light soon.

345
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:46,260
I essentially was able to prove that Michael was taken to a secure facility, is how I refer

346
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,060
to it, with this insider.

347
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,980
And so for me, and the thing is, is like, I didn't have to rely on any trust of Michael.

348
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,460
Like I didn't have to rely, like none of this is contingent upon me having to trust any

349
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,460
word that any person has told me.

350
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,380
This is objective data and evidence that I used to verify this.

351
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:18,860
When he got back, and we started talking, I didn't immediately reveal to him that I

352
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,740
was able to track where he went.

353
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:34,340
And so I used that opportunity to further vet and criticize, not criticize, but validate

354
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,140
his account.

355
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,340
So I was asking him specific questions about timing.

356
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,620
So at this location, Michael was both shown and told things by this insider.

357
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,820
What was he shown?

358
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,020
He hasn't told me what he saw there.

359
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,660
He said he he signed an NDA.

360
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,620
So what was Michael told?

361
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,020
Strangely enough, this insider was okay with Michael telling Joey and the greater public

362
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,660
about what he was told at this meeting.

363
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,820
Now, Joey and I are both a little apprehensive to discuss these points, as we cannot back

364
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,260
these up with any evidence, however, it's important to discuss anyways.

365
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,980
I feel a little uncomfortable like going through kind of the speculative stuff that this insider

366
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,180
has told Michael, because it's nothing I've been able to verify.

367
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,060
Well, according to this insider, he is an advocate for disclosure and has been in the

368
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,220
program for decades.

369
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,140
Remember guys, all of this is speculation.

370
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,540
This could very well be purposeful disinformation by this insider or utter nonsense, but I want

371
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,060
to talk about these statements due to the existence of the insider and the reality of

372
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
the meeting.

373
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,500
Fortunately, Joey has made a post on Reddit detailing this information, which will be

374
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,140
on screen now and in the show notes.

375
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,260
This is all content Michael has relayed publicly or given Joey permission to share.

376
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,100
Within the USG, there are two groups studying UAP, the blue group and the black group.

377
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,220
The blue group consists of programs with proper congressional oversight, Think, Arrow,

378
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,380
A-Tip, Blue Book, etc.

379
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,140
Black group is an organization founded in the 1940s to reverse engineer NHI tech.

380
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,500
The lack of oversight, accountability and endless reach of this black group mirrors almost

381
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,340
identically what is spoken about in the Wilson Davis memo.

382
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,300
This black group has successfully reverse engineered NHI craft to an unknown degree

383
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,540
of success, but utilizes these craft for operations.

384
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,700
The flying crafts are considered, quote, boring tech.

385
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,140
There are other technologies that are far more exciting and, in the insider's words,

386
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,180
utilitarian for humanity.

387
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:46,700
EMP-like weaponry has been developed that can target and disrupt and disable UAP.

388
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,860
Crash retrieval programs are able to lure UAP to locations where they are disabled via

389
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,020
the EMP weapons and craft and bodies are recovered.

390
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,500
Now we get into some of the real woo and troubling stuff.

391
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:05,820
The program recruits people with quote, psionic abilities and quote, referred to as P3, often

392
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,220
from third world nations.

393
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,540
These individuals are needed to interface with and control NHI tech.

394
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,460
Recruits from these third world countries are often bargained with to join the program

395
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,980
in exchange for security and safety of their families, likely due to the permanent or semi-permanent

396
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,080
isolation of the recruits while in the program.

397
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,660
This is the operation Michael stumbled upon in Indonesia.

398
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,500
Many recruits actually die in the process of interacting with NHI tech and this is due

399
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,020
to heavy drugging to induce a calm meditative state.

400
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,700
These recruits are treated like biological equipment.

401
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,340
In order to fly some interesting choice of words there, NHI craft, a consciousness connection

402
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,180
must be made.

403
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,300
A black program pilot cannot fly an NHI craft directly if he does not have the desired psionic

404
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,620
abilities mentioned.

405
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:01,340
So the program has devised a method to connect a recruit to a brain interface machine where

406
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,340
the pilot controls the machine to control the person's intentions, thus controlling

407
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,020
the craft.

408
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:14,020
If true and this is a big if, the implications of this program existing are beyond disturbing.

409
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,540
But let's try and keep investigating.

410
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,900
What else can Joey tell us about this insider?

411
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:26,860
I do know that this insider is real and I can say that because boy, I don't know how

412
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,580
I can publicly acknowledge how I know that.

413
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:37,500
I will say that there are other people who have corroborated the existence of this insider

414
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,140
to me personally.

415
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:49,900
I know that he took Michael to this location and so due to what I know this location to

416
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:58,500
be officially, it leads me to believe that this person has quite a bit of authority to

417
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,780
be able to bring him to this location in the nature in which he did.

418
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:14,300
My first question is how the heck does anyone get to bring a random person, Michael Herrera?

419
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,700
Especially a civilian at the time.

420
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
For sure.

421
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Yeah.

422
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,940
That's impossible, right?

423
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:25,340
There's got to be all the security and cross-checking and surveillance of every person who's walking

424
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,820
in and out of the place and the way this all went down was just like, holy crap.

425
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,380
He literally did that.

426
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,060
So what are the implications of that?

427
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:42,540
So I know Michael was taken to this location and I know the insider exists, but I don't

428
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,060
know if anything the insider is saying is true.

429
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,180
So the insider has provided Michael with a lot of leaks, information about the Black

430
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
Program.

431
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,100
He's specifically involved with the crash retrieval aspect.

432
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,220
So the question on my mind, and I'm guessing all of yours too, is why did this insider

433
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,780
tell all of this to Michael?

434
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,860
If this was a Psyop, why bring Michael all the way to this black site and show him all

435
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,260
of this unknown stuff?

436
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,940
And even if the insider is lying, this still does not account for Michael's experience

437
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,980
seeing the UFO in 2009.

438
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,380
That experience is not negated if this is a Psyop.

439
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,980
To me, both sides of the coin seem somewhat logical and plausible.

440
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,980
I often think back to the story of Paul Benowitz, who in 1989 was driven to insanity by being

441
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,060
fed false information about extraterrestrials by the CIA.

442
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,360
This is a fascinating story I might cover one day because it's really worth knowing.

443
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,860
On the other hand, if this figure is pro-disclosure but does not want to be public, it does make

444
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,340
sense for him to use Michael as a vessel.

445
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,900
Let's see what Joey thinks.

446
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
These guys don't want to come out publicly.

447
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,460
They have a lot at risk.

448
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:02,220
And personally, they have no interest in being like public figures about this topic.

449
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,860
There are allegedly a lot of factions within the program who aren't interested in this

450
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:16,420
becoming disclosed, and so there's personal risk with that as well.

451
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:23,820
And so I think he saw in Michael someone who was already comfortable with that risk of

452
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,100
being a whistleblower, and because he had that connection of understanding the operation

453
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:42,420
that Michael had witnessed, felt that he would be a good person to try to reach out to.

454
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,060
Something that raises suspicion about The Insider for both Joey and myself is the story

455
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,460
of a book.

456
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,740
A few weeks after the meeting, The Insider told Michael he was in the process of writing

457
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,740
a book under a ghostwriter.

458
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,580
The purpose of this book was to hide truth and fiction, similar to Secret Machines by

459
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,380
Tom DeLonge.

460
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,060
This book is titled Sentinels of Aether.

461
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,940
What sticks out to me as concerning here is the book was framed to be corroborating evidence

462
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,060
to support Michael's story, however, the connecting threads are thin at best.

463
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,660
In fact, this book is about an event that occurred in Mexico in 2004 in which a paramilitary

464
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,300
group in the Black Program wipe out an entire JSOC team during an operation.

465
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,700
The Black team is described as transporting humans inside shipping containers to a hidden

466
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,340
base in a mountain, which is similar to the containers Michael Herrera describes in his

467
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,340
encounter.

468
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,980
I didn't mention this earlier, but one of the things that Michael had been excited about

469
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,300
with this meeting was he was supposedly going to be given some evidence that would support

470
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,500
his claims.

471
00:33:48,500 --> 00:34:11,860
And the insider actually provided a two-chapter manuscript of the book currently under Dobser

472
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,060
Review to remove classified information.

473
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,820
In the insider's own words, he is playing a scheme or 4D chess on Dobser.

474
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,220
And of course, for those of you who don't know, Dobser is the Defense Office of Pre-Publication

475
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,020
and Security Review.

476
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,500
This is what David Grush is currently going through with his op-ed right now, so he doesn't

477
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,880
divulge any classified information.

478
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:41,900
And he does provide some context as to the sort of scheme that he's trying to play on

479
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:48,580
Dobser where he's intentionally, you know, including certain information that he knows,

480
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,820
you know, shouldn't be flagged by Dobser because it's like deep black projects that shouldn't

481
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
be acknowledged.

482
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,660
And he's trying to see if they'll catch it.

483
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:02,580
And it, I don't know, it just sounds, it just sounds a little sketchy, to be honest.

484
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,300
In fact, the insider directly quotes, quote, our intention is to put the DoD in a pickle

485
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,140
by creating dilemmas.

486
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,180
We are strategically taking advantage of the fact they must respond.

487
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
They don't have a choice.

488
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,420
No poker face.

489
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,300
Any response will provide us with information slash intelligence and inverse intelligence.

490
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,300
One of the other things that Joey has more information on than almost anybody else are

491
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,260
the thoughts and words of Michael's fellow platoon members who were with him in Indonesia

492
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,980
in 2009.

493
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,460
According to the original Daily Mail article that was written on Herrera, the other four

494
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,820
or five Marines in Herrera's platoon were too scared to come forward.

495
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,060
Bar one text message that read, quote, Hey man, this is asking too much of me.

496
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,740
It's not worth the risk.

497
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,260
My family and military career far exceed anything you are asking of me.

498
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,180
It's not worth my life or jeopardizing my family.

499
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,500
I know we go back, but this is asking too much.

500
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,860
You need to get out of whatever you are in and don't get me involved.

501
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:12,620
So I've talked to a handful of people who were in his platoon and were on that mission,

502
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
on that ship.

503
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:20,860
I would say not the UFO mission, the alleged UFO mission, but I'll say the Indonesia relief

504
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,700
effort mission or operation.

505
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,140
I will say that out of those people that I have spoken to, all of them believe Michael

506
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:35,220
is lying, except for, well, except for one.

507
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:43,420
There's one person that I've reached out to and asked for permission to ask some questions

508
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,420
about it.

509
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,300
And he just said, no, thank you and leave my name out of everything.

510
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,580
But everyone else thinks Michael is lying.

511
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:58,220
But the thing that's interesting is, you know, once I get into conversation with these people,

512
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:06,100
they quickly reveal that, you know, because someone says very strongly, I know he's lying.

513
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,100
My follow-up question is, oh, so you were boots on the ground with him in Indonesia?

514
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:17,060
And their reply is, well, no, I was in a different squad or oh, no, I was, I was, I stayed on

515
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
the ship.

516
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
I didn't leave the ship.

517
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,740
And so immediately I'm like, well, you can't possibly know he's lying because you weren't

518
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
there.

519
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,940
Like how can you say you know he's lying?

520
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,140
So, you know, that was really disappointing to hear.

521
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,700
However, I still, I still maintained conversations with these people because they did, you know,

522
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:43,780
certain people provided some, you know, personal photographs that I was able to, you know, there

523
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:50,660
was nothing crazy in the photographs, but it did prove that they were in, you know, the

524
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,420
Taming Airport where the coordination efforts were happening.

525
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,100
There's one person who I do find very credible who speaks against Michael.

526
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:09,660
I'll just say his first name, his name's Nathan, and he was Michael's team leader.

527
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:17,100
And he provided, so I've had several, you know, text conversations with him, and he

528
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:28,380
provided a photograph that he alleges shows Michael and another Marine on a helicopter.

529
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,060
And he says they're all being flown into Indonesia.

530
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,340
They don't have rifles, right?

531
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,460
This photograph is important because if it is proven to be Michael, it kind of shows

532
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:46,260
that he's lying about something, you know, or, you know, most of the story gets kind

533
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,460
of discredited because, you know, the big part of Michael's story was he had rifles

534
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:58,220
and, you know, he was with different people.

535
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,460
So Michael, you know, I did share that photograph with Michael.

536
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,620
I didn't give him any contacts.

537
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,980
I just said, do you know who's in this photograph?

538
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,860
And he provided two names.

539
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,220
And, you know, then I explained, you know, that the allegations that one of one of the

540
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,900
people is him and, and he denies it, he very strongly denies it.

541
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:27,380
And what's interesting to me to kind of play towards Michael in a way, let's say Nathan's

542
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:33,820
telling the truth, let's say Michael did fly in with him without rifles.

543
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,140
And let's say Michael was on that flight, right?

544
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,500
What that would mean if he is lying about this UFO thing?

545
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,740
That means he was thinking, let me, let me make up a story about a UFO, but also let

546
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:57,620
me lie in about a mission I know I went on with my squad, even though he knows there

547
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,300
were witnesses and he knows, you know, his photo is being taken.

548
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,580
That just doesn't make any sense to me.

549
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,060
Like why would he, like he could have very easily just said, yeah, that is me in the

550
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:13,580
photograph, but I also took a different flight in later on or earlier in the day.

551
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,580
You know, he could have made it so he could have just acknowledged that both things are

552
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,500
true and it would have totally negated that photographic evidence.

553
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,780
The question of rifles or lack thereof in Nathan's alleged photograph is crucial.

554
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,340
Since Indonesia 2009 was a humanitarian mission, Marines were not supposed to be equipped with

555
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,540
rifles.

556
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,580
As I stated earlier, and what was actually confirmed to Joey by all the Marines he spoke

557
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:44,620
to, the first wave of Marines in Indonesia were in fact armed, but subsequent deployments

558
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,780
were not due to bad optics.

559
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,900
Allegedly, an Air Force Colonel yelled at the Marines and ordered them to stop utilizing

560
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,740
rifles.

561
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:57,100
And now the reason why probably half of you are watching this video with a renewed interest

562
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,020
in Michael Herrera, the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1.

563
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,060
In this report, Michael Herrera is all but named as somebody who testified to Arrow stating

564
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,060
quote,

565
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,740
An interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said in that 2009, while participating

566
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,100
in a humanitarian and security mission in a foreign country, he encountered U.S. special

567
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,100
forces loading containers onto a large extraterrestrial spacecraft.

568
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,220
And guys, I probably don't need to explain this to you, but Arrow Historical Report Volume

569
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,980
1 is not the most accurate report we've ever seen.

570
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:39,220
In fact, in this two to three sentence summary of Michael Herrera, there are two factual inaccuracies.

571
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,740
One, Michael never claimed he encountered U.S. special forces.

572
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,180
What he said was he encountered men with American dialects.

573
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:55,540
With American gear, but no rank, no insignia, no identifiers to where they belonged.

574
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,860
And two, Herrera said, even from his first statement, he thought the craft he saw was

575
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,300
human reverse engineered, not extraterrestrial.

576
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,780
Is this just awful writing or purposeful disinformation?

577
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,460
I lean more towards purposeful.

578
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,700
I think this is so bogus and just in a two sentence summary, getting so many facts wrong.

579
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:22,380
In my opinion, this sort of misreporting is on purpose and a symptom of the larger sickness

580
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,260
that is this report.

581
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,300
And I just want to touch on what seems to be a big misconception in the UAP community

582
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,720
on Twitter and Reddit at the moment.

583
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,780
On page 32, under the section, the UAP with peculiar characteristics refers to an authentic

584
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,500
non-UAP related SAP.

585
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,580
Some people are confusing this statement as describing Michael Herrera.

586
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,740
In the statement, it says, Arrow was able to correlate this account with an authentic

587
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,860
USG program because the interviewee was able to provide a relatively precise time and location.

588
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,100
As first pointed out to me by Joey, Michael narrowed down the timing of the event to within

589
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,940
a couple days, but he did not know the precise time.

590
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,020
And Michael did not know the exact location of the landing zone in Indonesia.

591
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:12,780
In the same section, whatever person was writing this error report stated that the seemingly

592
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,380
strange characteristics reported by the interviewee matched closely with the platform's characteristics

593
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,780
which was being tested at a military facility in the timeframe.

594
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,240
The interviewee was there.

595
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,160
But again, as Joey points out, Michael's encounter occurred in a remote part of the

596
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,080
jungle in Indonesia, not a military facility.

597
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,640
What was massively vindicating to Joey and something that made him place more trust in

598
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,160
Michael, and he even relayed this to me months before the Arrow Historical Report Volume

599
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,960
1, Michael had actually told Joey and provided him proof that he had testified to Arrow.

600
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,960
He said that they didn't record his testimony like they did.

601
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,400
They weren't actually like electronically recording his testimony.

602
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,800
There were just people in a skiff and some of them had notepads and were just like taking

603
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,320
notes occasionally.

604
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:13,640
So the summary of his testimony in the report could literally just be the result of poor

605
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:23,640
note-taking and I am perfectly comfortable with accusing them of doing this intentionally

606
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:32,280
because it certainly seems like something that they were trying to prevent as much of

607
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:43,520
a paper trail as possible and leaving a lot of the records up to interpretation.

608
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,160
I think that was 100% intentional.

609
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:56,720
So I don't know if it was malicious misquoting of Michael or just literally poor note-taking

610
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,240
and someone read someone else's notes and summarized and misinterpreted or whatever.

611
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,000
Did he testify to Dr. Kirkpatrick or was it just Arrow employees?

612
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,680
He says it was directly to Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the room.

613
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,920
But another thing that I'll mention as well, something that I kind of caught was speaking

614
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:27,000
of that statute that would provide penalties to anyone who lies, I noticed that Arrow was

615
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,760
extremely careful in their report not to accuse a single whistleblower of lying or misleading.

616
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:46,160
They emphasized how accepting they are of the fact that these whistleblowers believe

617
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,080
what they're telling Arrow.

618
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,560
And again, I think that was incredibly intentional.

619
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,720
It was really like the first opening statement in the report.

620
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,800
If you really highlight the key words there, it's literally all about belief.

621
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,760
I'm just emphasizing belief and everyone's entitled to their belief and we can't criticize

622
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,480
or hold it against anyone if they believe something.

623
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,560
And that was intentional so that nobody could ... I previously asserted that Arrow would

624
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,520
be forced to prosecute if they lied, but that's not really the case.

625
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,920
I kind of misspoke there really.

626
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,080
I think it would still would have made an opportunity for other lawyers or organizations

627
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:41,600
to press charges against whistleblowers if they had lied and Arrow would be kind of

628
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,800
in a position potentially to provide evidence that supports that assertion.

629
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:54,520
So they wanted to make sure to avoid that at all costs and that's why they did that.

630
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,160
Of course, I was fascinated to know if Michael had spoken to any other whistleblowers or

631
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,320
people behind the scenes.

632
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,040
While Joey understandably couldn't comment, he did tell me something interesting that

633
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,880
kind of made me jump for joy.

634
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:16,480
I do know that he has spoken to Jonathan Weighant, which was pretty interesting because they

635
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,040
did have sort of similar experiences.

636
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,360
So yeah, so that was really cool to think that Jonathan kind of had gotten the chance

637
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,800
to speak with someone else that had a similar experience.

638
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,180
I personally believe it is probable that Michael and Weighant encountered the same insider

639
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,120
paramilitary group.

640
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,600
Too many similarities to men with American dialects and all black gear that appear to

641
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,960
have highly skilled backgrounds.

642
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,240
Of course, in Weighant's case, he did specifically see men in DOE rain jackets, which allowed

643
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,920
me to conclude that these are likely a DOE NES team.

644
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,560
Again watch that analysis in my Marines video and then listen back to Michael's testimony

645
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,040
and cross reference the two teams.

646
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,640
And lastly guys, I kind of wanted to touch on some of the criticism that Joey has received.

647
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,560
He has received so much support for his investigation, but also a lot of hate online.

648
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,920
People calling him Michael's shill, people calling him Michael's publicist, or even

649
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,120
Michael under a pseudonym.

650
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,760
And understandably so, he's received some flak for receiving evidence, yet not making

651
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,120
it public.

652
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,640
Let's see what he has to say.

653
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,920
I'm in no way his publicist.

654
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:37,160
Yeah, I there's a few exceptions to that where there there were people that I felt would

655
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,120
be good people to interview him.

656
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,580
One of them is Chris Leto.

657
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,200
So that was a case where I reached out to Chris and kind of did made the first contact

658
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,800
and then introduced him.

659
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:57,600
I just hope people will be open to continuing to just follow, you know, more as as the story

660
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,400
unfolds because it's a very, it's a very interesting case because you not only do you have this

661
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,840
historical event that happened in 2009 that still has a ton of data that is yet to be

662
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,640
uncovered.

663
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,280
Even by myself, you know, yes, there's things that I do have privately that I can't share,

664
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,160
but there's also, you know, other data that hasn't been uncovered by myself or anyone.

665
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,560
But now we have this kind of current thing that's unfolding as we speak.

666
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:32,200
I mean, there are there are things happening right now behind the scenes as we speak.

667
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,480
So I think I think it's incredibly interesting and worth paying attention to.

668
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,920
And you know, no one has to make a decision about whether they think it's true or false

669
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,920
at this point.

670
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:50,920
I've been taking this a lot more seriously than I ever did previously, and I am giving

671
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:58,080
the benefit of the doubt to the other people involved behind the scenes.

672
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,840
And I'm and I am taking them very seriously.

673
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:11,280
And I'm respecting anybody's request for me not to reveal certain information because

674
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,120
that's that's just the right thing to do.

675
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,680
And people criticize me.

676
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,960
And it's and it it kills me because I totally understand the criticism.

677
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,920
I can't even argue the criticism because I did make the decision to kind of have this

678
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,600
compromise where I'd reach out to people like yourself and other, you know, podcasters and

679
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:40,520
journalists and people who I trust and, you know, reveal my identity, you know, you and

680
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,440
I, we had a we've we've had video calls, you've seen my face, you know, who I am.

681
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,200
And I've shared some information with you that backs up some of my evidence of or, you

682
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,160
know, shared some of my evidence that backs up my opinions on certain things.

683
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,160
And so really, as the best compromise I could come up with, you know, for now, I do hope

684
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,040
to get to a point where I can be public and share more evidence.

685
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,200
But for right now, that that was kind of the best compromise I could come up with.

686
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,400
And one last thing I'd like to touch on is the connection between Michael Herrera and

687
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,200
Stephen Greer.

688
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,400
I've touched upon this in almost every single one of my videos where there is a whistleblower,

689
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,440
even my Marines video because of Jonathan Wagon.

690
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,640
So if you're interested to hear more, go check any of those out.

691
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,200
But I think it's important to start separating the whistleblowers from Dr.

692
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,400
Greer. It's no surprise I have my problems with Dr.

693
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,960
Greer, but I'm trying to take an approach where I will individually vet whistleblowers

694
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,040
and people separate from Greer.

695
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,160
I see a lot of people saying that these two are in cahoots, which is just blatantly not

696
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,960
true. In fact, Michael himself has said that Dr.

697
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,800
Greer has embellished or purposefully lied about details of his story.

698
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,040
There's been some interviews that Dr.

699
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,960
Greer has done and everything like that, where he's told people that they put guns

700
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,640
right to our head. That wasn't the case.

701
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,040
These guys were at a standoff distance because it's easier to go like this than actually be

702
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,720
at a standoff distance and try to rush somebody who has had a good distance that can sight in

703
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,360
and just shoot you.

704
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,400
So we need to understand that Dr.

705
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,520
Greer is probably one of the only avenues whistleblowers have to come forward that they know of

706
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,480
before David Grush. Hopefully things change in the future and people start pursuing the avenues

707
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,120
of Grush or maybe Carl Nell or maybe if there's some changes arrow.

708
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,600
But it's important to kind of separate Herrera from Greer.

709
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,080
I would like to thank him for trusting me with some of the more sensitive evidence regarding

710
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,600
Herrera. This case is ongoing and I don't imagine there's going to be just one follow-up video

711
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:14,280
he and I make to this. Michael Herrera's case has almost consumed me of late.

712
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,200
I think about it all the time. I studied all the time and I talk to Joey about it all the time.

713
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,560
So this case is so fascinating to me. I can't believe I initially brushed it off by buying

714
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:31,480
into the Greer hate or buying into some of the kind of nonsensical thoughts of just diminishing

715
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,200
his testimony and thinking he's fully because of some details that seem odd at first when

716
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:42,520
hearing about his story. I am still torn on the insider in terms of is this guy conducting a

717
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:48,600
psyop or telling Michael real information. I just don't have enough evidence right now to know.

718
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,600
But what do you guys think after hearing some more of this video and hearing from Joey,

719
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,040
do you guys believe more in Michael or less? Has his credibility increased or decreased in

720
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,200
your eyes? I'd love to hear from you guys because this case is so fascinating to me.
