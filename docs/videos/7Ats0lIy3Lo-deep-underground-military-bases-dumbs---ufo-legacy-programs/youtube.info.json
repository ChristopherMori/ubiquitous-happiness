    "description": "A deep dive into the subject of UFO legacy programs and Deep Underground Military Bases (D.U.M.Bs.) sometimes also referred to as Subterranean Facilities (STFs). \n\nWhether it be MS and the Dugway D.U.M.B., the Off-World Technologies Division under NSWC Crane, or the Northrop Tejon and Lockheed Helendale RCS facilities, the subject of clandestine, deep-sixed, underground military bases arises frequently in this channel's investigations.\n\nThis project serves to investigate acknowledged underground sites as well as unacknowledged underground sites possibly used for UFO RDT&E, and analyze and evaluate decades of persisting rumors of deep underground tunnel networks and Maglev train transportation systems connecting these deep sites. \n\nThis investigation aims to evaluate claims of underground networks of UFO  legacy program-related STFs through analysis of the work of Dr. Richard Sauder and his 3 excellent, fact-driven books on D.U.M.Bs., research by tremendous UFO researchers such as Bill Hamilton and Leonard Stringfield, witness testimony, and myriad technical documents stemming from US Army Corps of Engineers, the RAND Corporation, Bechtel, TRW, BDM, and more.\n\nAs always, I will post links and research materials that aided in this investigation. For the subject of D.U.M.Bs., I plan to post a host of research documents, including links to every single technical report mentioned in this project and Dr. Sauder's books alongside my usual research links.
