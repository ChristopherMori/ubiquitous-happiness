00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
When discussing UFO legacy programs, I aim to expose any clandestine black-budget U.S.

00:06.560 --> 00:11.840
government military intelligence operation, partnering with defense contractors, federally

00:11.840 --> 00:16.880
funded research and development centers, and university-affiliated research centers engaging

00:16.880 --> 00:23.520
with non-human technology. These programs seem to take many forms, including crash recovery of

00:23.920 --> 00:29.520
non-human vehicles, material exploitation of technologies of unknown origin, reverse

00:29.520 --> 00:35.520
engineering of anomalous craft, and construction of copycat vehicles famously known as alien

00:35.520 --> 00:41.840
reproduction vehicles, ARVs. On this channel, we have discussed myriad major range and test

00:41.840 --> 00:47.280
facility bases and defense laboratories and centers where such programs are likely located.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.520
We have also discussed at length contractors, FFRDCs, and UARCs that are alleged to operate

00:53.520 --> 01:01.520
alongside the CIA and NSA across Army, Navy, and Air Force UFO programs. When such clandestine and

01:01.520 --> 01:07.120
secretive operations to master non-human technology have led to, in David Grush's words,

01:07.120 --> 01:12.880
a multi-decade secret Cold War, where might these programs be located? The logistics of

01:12.880 --> 01:19.040
maintaining secrecy and strict need to know access for unacknowledged special access programs focused

01:19.040 --> 01:24.560
on anomalous research, development, test, and evaluation of non-human technologies and storage

01:24.560 --> 01:31.760
of non-human craft and possibly biologics are likely tremendous. For this reason, we must look

01:31.760 --> 01:38.240
underground and evaluate the decades of rumors and testimonies of UFOs and deep underground

01:38.240 --> 01:44.080
military bases, or DUMMS. DUMMS have served as a continuous focus of this channel with recent

01:44.080 --> 01:50.000
discussion and direct investigation into dugway-proving ground. The United States premier chemical

01:50.000 --> 01:56.320
and biological testing range and its alleged 1,300 square mile subterranean facility and

01:56.320 --> 02:02.320
remote entrance in the desert. For this investigation, we will be continuously referencing the work of

02:02.400 --> 02:08.400
Dr. Richard Sotter and his three masterpieces titled Underground Bases and Tunnels, What is the

02:08.400 --> 02:14.320
Government Trying to Hide? Hidden in Plain Site Beyond the X-Files and Underground and Underwater

02:14.320 --> 02:20.400
Bases. These three dense pieces give us keen context into subterranean bases in the form of

02:20.400 --> 02:26.160
stringent fact-based analysis through publicly available records, FOIA documents, declassified

02:26.160 --> 02:32.720
documents, and the occasional witness testimony. Deep underground military bases do indeed exist.

02:32.720 --> 02:39.520
This is fact and we will explore this fact today, but do these sites engage with UFO legacy programs?

02:39.520 --> 02:46.480
And if so, which DoD sites and what do they do? And could the decades of rumors regarding underground

02:46.480 --> 02:52.560
tunnels connecting these clandestine sites through an internal rail system possibly be true?

02:52.640 --> 02:57.520
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so very much for joining me today as we embark into the

02:57.520 --> 03:04.240
world of the subterranean to investigate DUMs and UFOs. The subject of UFO legacy sites embedded

03:04.240 --> 03:09.120
into mountains with hidden hangars sequestered a mile beneath the Earth's surface or hidden

03:09.120 --> 03:13.840
anywhere out of the public and satellite view has long been a talking point of this channel

03:13.840 --> 03:19.840
in my investigations. Today, we finally look below the Earth's surface to evaluate the existence,

03:19.840 --> 03:26.080
feasibility, and operations of UFO legacy programs and deep underground military bases.

03:31.200 --> 03:36.800
To borrow from the title of the first chapter of Dr. Richard Sotter's Underground Bases and Tunnels,

03:36.800 --> 03:42.560
deep underground military bases are indeed real. Throughout this project, I will be interchangeably

03:42.560 --> 03:49.280
using the terms DUM and subterranean facility or stiff. The name said to me by multiple veterans

03:49.280 --> 03:55.440
who have traveled to such underground locations. And speaking of, I should mention, I have spoken

03:55.440 --> 04:00.800
to nearly half a dozen former military personnel who have traveled to stiffs across the country.

04:00.800 --> 04:06.160
I try to shy away from inserting first hand source testimony and anecdotes into my videos and let

04:06.160 --> 04:11.360
evidence and research speak for itself, so I will interject with these first hand testimonies when

04:11.360 --> 04:18.160
and if necessary. In a 1989 speech titled Underground Facilities for Defense, Experience

04:18.160 --> 04:23.600
and Lessons, Deputy Director of Engineering and Construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

04:23.600 --> 04:29.520
Lloyd A. Dusha said, quote, After World War II, political and economic factors changed the

04:29.520 --> 04:35.440
underground construction picture and caused a renewed interest to think underground. As a result

04:35.440 --> 04:40.320
of this interest, the Corps of Engineers became involved in the design and construction of some

04:40.320 --> 04:46.240
very complex and interesting military projects, end quote. In the same talk, Dusha would then go

04:46.240 --> 04:51.520
on to exclaim, quote, Although the conference program indicates the topic to be underground

04:51.520 --> 04:57.280
facilities for defense, experience and lessons, I must deviate a little because several of the

04:57.280 --> 05:02.800
most interesting facilities that have been designed and constructed by the Corps are still classified,

05:02.800 --> 05:08.800
end quote. Acknowledged military subterranean facilities do indeed exist. Publicly known sites

05:08.800 --> 05:14.720
include the Norad Cheyenne Mountain Complex buried deep under Colorado Springs. This enormous

05:14.800 --> 05:20.160
installation built to monitor North American missile threats sits 2,000 feet underground

05:20.160 --> 05:27.680
and spans 5.1 acres, featuring six three-story high and 40 foot wide tunnels and 15 three-story

05:27.680 --> 05:33.120
buildings made of steel plates. And these are just the acknowledged portions of the base.

05:33.120 --> 05:39.920
Additionally, the Raven Rock Complex, aka Site R, serves as a secure underground command center or

05:39.920 --> 05:45.600
backup Pentagon and is shrouded in mystery. This site under Fort Detrick, Maryland includes

05:45.600 --> 05:51.520
accommodations for 3,000 people, has an inbuilt medical and dental clinic, fire department,

05:51.520 --> 05:57.280
post office and five acknowledged three-story buildings. The secrets Raven Rock must hold

05:57.280 --> 06:02.960
are endless, but existing acknowledged dumps are not the focus of today's investigation.

06:02.960 --> 06:08.560
Instead, we plan to pursue dumps that operate as UFO legacy program locations and explore the

06:08.640 --> 06:14.560
feasibility of decades of rumors of hundreds, if not thousands of miles of underground tunnels

06:14.560 --> 06:21.120
and railroads connecting deep underground UFO legacy operations. To once again quote, U.S. Army

06:21.120 --> 06:26.720
Corps of Engineers Deputy Director for Engineering and Construction Lloyd A. Dusha, when speaking

06:26.720 --> 06:31.760
about the Corps' involvement in the 1960s construction of the Cheyenne site, quote.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.800
As stated earlier, there are other projects of similar scope, which I cannot identify,

06:36.800 --> 06:41.680
but which include multiple chambers up to 50 feet wide and 100 feet high,

06:41.680 --> 06:46.720
using the same excavation procedure mentioned for the NORAD facility, end quote.

06:46.720 --> 06:51.520
After all, according to a 1985 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report titled

06:51.520 --> 06:56.800
Literature Survey of Underground Construction Methods for Application to Harden Facilities,

06:56.800 --> 07:01.280
STIFs can be built anywhere with the right amount of money and in myriad types of

07:01.280 --> 07:06.560
structures utilizing deep shaft structures and facilities tunneled into mountain sides.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.520
The report even states, quote, since adequate technology is available to construct hardened

07:11.520 --> 07:16.320
underground facilities under virtually any ground conditions, the main constraint in

07:16.320 --> 07:21.840
construction projects remains economic viability rather than technical feasibility, end quote.

07:21.840 --> 07:27.520
As we know from David Grush and multiple other sources and testimonies, UFO legacy programs

07:27.520 --> 07:33.680
operate on the U.S. Black budget. Untraceable, deep-sixed money and contracts buried within

07:33.760 --> 07:38.640
special access, controlled access and unacknowledged special access programs.

07:38.640 --> 07:44.320
From the excellent work of Catherine Austin Fitz, I mention often, we also know that as much as $21

07:44.320 --> 07:51.280
trillion in unauthorized spending has occurred between 1998 and 2015. And this is just within

07:51.280 --> 07:56.400
the DOD and Department of Housing and Urban Development, much of which Fitz believed was

07:56.400 --> 08:02.320
designated for clandestine military R&D. Publicly denied UFO, research development,

08:02.320 --> 08:08.560
test and evaluation underground locations would absolutely classify as such. Dumbs for clandestine

08:08.560 --> 08:14.320
and unacknowledged use is also a practice very much currently in play. One such example is

08:14.320 --> 08:19.920
Warrenton U.S. Army Training Center located in the northern Virginia town of Warrenton. The book

08:19.920 --> 08:25.440
The Secret Team, the CIA and its allies in control of the world by Fletcher Prouty, identified a

08:25.440 --> 08:30.640
highly secretive underground installation that serves as a federal relocation center by an

08:30.640 --> 08:37.280
unknown agency. This was confirmed in an inquiry magazine article titled Going Underground by

08:37.280 --> 08:42.880
Robert Walters, which plainly states that U.S. Army Warrenton Training Center is a CIA covert

08:42.880 --> 08:48.240
facility. Additionally, there is the highly secretive U.S. Navy underground facility in the

08:48.240 --> 08:54.320
mountains of West Virginia near Sugar Grove. This location is an underground site run by the Navy

08:54.320 --> 09:01.200
for the National Security Agency, so the NSA and CIA already have a traceable interest in using U.S.

09:01.200 --> 09:07.680
military bases underground facilities as a cover for unknown usage in operations. So before discussing

09:07.680 --> 09:12.960
much of the testimony of UFOs and Dumbs, let's quickly touch on the reality and history of these

09:12.960 --> 09:23.040
impressive, often unacknowledged sites. The inception of Dumbs in the United States can

09:23.040 --> 09:28.240
actually be traced back to the Nazis, an operation paperclip, the famous program to recruit

09:28.240 --> 09:34.000
Nazi scientists, engineers, and technicians into U.S. government employment. Near the end of World

09:34.000 --> 09:40.400
War II, the Nazis had begun utilization of what we might call Dumbs. In the book Lucky Forward,

09:40.400 --> 09:45.680
The History of Patent's Third Army, Colonel Robert S. Allen detailed Allied discoveries of

09:45.680 --> 09:51.920
Nazi underground bases, quote, the underground installations were amazing. They were literally

09:52.000 --> 09:59.120
subterranean towns. There were four in and around Ordruf. None were natural caverns or mines. All

09:59.120 --> 10:05.120
were man-made military installations. The horror camp had provided the labor. An interesting feature

10:05.120 --> 10:10.560
of the construction was the absence of any spoil. It had been carefully scattered into hills miles

10:10.560 --> 10:16.800
away, end quote. Some Nazi installations were over 50 feet underground, comprised of several

10:16.880 --> 10:22.960
miles of two to three story facilities. The sites were arranged like wheels with spokes designed

10:22.960 --> 10:29.360
with reinforced concrete. The Nazis designed such locations as Ordruf to house Nazi high command

10:29.360 --> 10:34.640
after the bombing of Berlin, but never got the chance to populate the facility. We additionally

10:34.640 --> 10:41.040
have the Regenwurm Lager, or Earthworm Camp in Poland. This Nazi sprawling underground complex

10:41.120 --> 10:47.360
beneath West Poland's full extent is still unknown today. The site featured miles of underground

10:47.360 --> 10:52.240
tunnels and electrical train lines connecting bunkers, fortifications, and other critical

10:52.240 --> 10:57.920
military facilities. This sounds familiar, no? Two declassified documents can be discovered

10:57.920 --> 11:04.240
dating back to 1947 regarding the aforementioned Operation Paperclip. Featured in the documents

11:04.240 --> 11:10.400
are requests by Air Material Command for a quote unquote requirement of four German technicians

11:10.400 --> 11:16.320
to consult on a planned underground plant program. One man named was Xavier Dorsch,

11:16.320 --> 11:22.160
director of the TOT organization in the closing of World War Two. This was the Nazi's equivalent

11:22.160 --> 11:28.240
of the US Navy Seabees, or US Army Corps of Engineers, but not part of formal German military

11:28.240 --> 11:33.680
structure. The founder of this organization, Fritz Tott, designed the famous German Autobahn

11:33.680 --> 11:38.960
Highway System. Towards the tail end of World War Two, Dorsch had helped with developing a series

11:38.960 --> 11:44.800
of massive underground industrial manufacturing facilities to hide from Allied bombing raids.

11:44.800 --> 11:49.920
It is indeed quite possible he also aided on the Regenwurm Lager and Ordruf.

11:49.920 --> 11:55.680
Documents and research show Dorsch once briefed the Americans after he was captured in 1945 and

11:55.680 --> 12:02.480
again in 1949, we do not know the full extent to which he aided in these programs. These massive

12:02.480 --> 12:07.200
Nazi underground industrial manufacturing facilities possibly give us our first look

12:07.200 --> 12:13.200
into UFO legacy programs and dums. I have covered on this channel the 1933 Magenta,

12:13.200 --> 12:19.040
Italy UFO crash retrieval, a case whose validity is strongly supported by David Grush.

12:19.040 --> 12:27.040
You said it's a 90 year cover up. Just about, yeah. 90 years. 1933 was the first recovery in

12:27.040 --> 12:34.000
Europe in Magenta, Italy. They recovered a partially intact vehicle. In this case,

12:34.000 --> 12:40.240
the Nazis purportedly took control of a crashed lenticular disk from the Italians in 1943 before

12:40.240 --> 12:46.240
being recovered by the Americans post war. Hans Kamler was a Nazi engineer behind construction

12:46.240 --> 12:52.560
of numerous concentration camps, including Auschwitz and led myriad Nazi secret weapons projects.

12:52.560 --> 12:57.600
Kamler would have indeed been one of chief scientists and engineers to study a recovered

12:57.600 --> 13:02.960
lenticular craft due to his unrivaled command over Nazi secret weapons programs.

13:03.040 --> 13:07.680
Kamler went missing near the tail end of World War Two. However, documents prove rather

13:07.680 --> 13:14.000
convincingly this evil engineer was taken alive into US custody. Albert Speer, Nazi and Reich

13:14.000 --> 13:19.920
Minister of Armaments and War Production claimed in April 1945, Kamler informed him he had business

13:19.920 --> 13:26.320
to offer the Americans. OSS agent Donald W. Richardson seemingly confirmed this by stating

13:26.320 --> 13:31.840
70 years after he still couldn't fully speak on interrogating Kamler. But the Nazis had

13:31.840 --> 13:36.880
brought treasure to the US that, quote, served the development of armament platforms for the Cold

13:36.880 --> 13:42.480
War and for the future, end quote. Under Kamler's command, numerous underground tunnels and bases

13:42.480 --> 13:47.680
existed, employing German companies to develop and build parts for advanced aircraft and secret

13:47.680 --> 13:52.800
weapons programs. Kamler is even said to have stashed treasures and documents regarding his

13:52.800 --> 13:58.560
think tanks top secret documents in a facility underground in the woods of Czechoslovakia.

13:58.560 --> 14:04.400
According to Hidden Nazi by Dan Ruder, 44 years after Operation Hidden documents to retrieve

14:04.400 --> 14:09.760
these stashed top secret documents, an American team from Lawrence Livermore Labs and Los Alamos

14:09.760 --> 14:16.000
Labs to FFRDCs went to a new underground cavern that had not been emptied at the end of World

14:16.000 --> 14:20.800
War Two called Mednick Hill. What was found here was, quote, the key to what was hidden at the

14:20.800 --> 14:26.720
previous site, end quote. It goes without saying it stands to reason Kamler conducted early iterations

14:26.720 --> 14:32.560
of UFO legacy programs underneath Mednick Hill, as well as his numerous underground locations and

14:32.560 --> 14:38.960
tunnels, and that Xavier Dorsch was a key engineer in constructing these facilities. With Dorsch being

14:38.960 --> 14:44.720
requested by air material command and Kamler being more than likely secretly smuggled by the Americans,

14:44.720 --> 14:52.080
these two men could very well be the key architects of modern day US UFO and dumb legacy programs.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.880
I am no expert in history, so to learn more about Kamler, I strongly recommend watching

14:56.880 --> 15:02.960
the documentary The Two Lives of Hans Kamler. Later in this project, we will see even more ties

15:02.960 --> 15:08.960
between Nazi Germany, Dumbs, and Paperclip than in the form of Maglev train systems.

15:14.480 --> 15:20.160
On numerous occasions in the 1950s, the United States proposed massive underground facilities

15:20.160 --> 15:25.600
that seemingly disappeared from public light. It is unknown if many of these facilities were

15:25.600 --> 15:32.480
built or not. One example can be traced to 1957 to Green Mountain outside Huntsville, Alabama.

15:32.480 --> 15:38.240
Huntsville is deeply enshrouded in US anti-gravity research, but we are looking elsewhere.

15:38.240 --> 15:44.000
Two articles in 1957 reported the US Army was planning to build a rocket factory inside of

15:44.000 --> 15:48.880
Green Mountain. The plan was proposed by the American Machine and Foundry Company, Redstone

15:48.880 --> 15:55.280
Arsenal, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This location was slated to have a sort of subterranean

15:55.280 --> 15:59.840
junior Pentagon, where elaborate headquarters would be installed to direct the defense of the

15:59.840 --> 16:05.920
southern US from enemy attack. Again, it is unknown if this location was ever built. However,

16:05.920 --> 16:11.840
such discussion of a junior Pentagon illustrated early private military cooperation, a theme we

16:11.840 --> 16:17.680
will touch on much more much later. Analysis of US military and underground studies additionally

16:17.680 --> 16:23.840
allows us valuable insights into DUMMS. Take the RAND Corporation for example. An FFRDC I have

16:23.840 --> 16:30.400
spoken about ad nauseam is a primary semi-government institution up to its eyeballs in UFO legacy

16:30.400 --> 16:37.360
programs. RAND Corporation was established in 1948 and grew out of Army Air Force Project RAND in

16:37.360 --> 16:44.000
1946. Project RAND sought to carry out long-range research projects of interest to the Air Force.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.760
In the 1950s, USAF and RAND began working on the question of underground-based construction and

16:49.760 --> 16:56.240
organized various symposiums. Let's analyze a resulting 1959 publication, Deep Underground

16:56.240 --> 17:00.960
Construction. The purpose of such a symposium, according to the chairman, was to discuss,

17:00.960 --> 17:05.920
quote, the problems of protecting military installations located deep underground or

17:05.920 --> 17:10.800
under mountains, end quote, in the event of nuclear war. The chairman also stated,

17:10.800 --> 17:16.560
since 1957, the RAND corp had been, quote, actively investigating the need for a small

17:16.560 --> 17:23.280
number of super hard, deep underground centers, end quote. Additionally, in 1960, RAND published

17:23.280 --> 17:29.680
a study under USAF contract dealing 12 locations for underground sites. All sites were assumed to

17:29.680 --> 17:37.200
be more than 1000 feet deep. Of specific interest here is site three in Santa Barbara, California.

17:37.200 --> 17:42.960
Santa Barbara is located just over 100 miles from the Antelope Valley, California. We will discuss

17:42.960 --> 17:49.760
later. Research suggests a major network of UFO-focused stiff facilities exists interconnected

17:49.760 --> 17:55.840
under the antelope. Site three is also located less than 100 miles away from Los Angeles,

17:55.840 --> 18:01.680
where a tremendous amount of DoD research development tests and evaluation laboratories lie.

18:01.680 --> 18:07.360
We have already mentioned the US Army Corps of Engineer giving in 1989 a quite frank admission

18:07.360 --> 18:13.840
of classified underground facilities. An outside of the 1987 US Army Corps of Engineer report detailing

18:13.840 --> 18:20.800
construction of Dumbs boils down to cost. In 1959 to 1961, the Army Corps of Engineer published a

18:20.800 --> 18:27.280
five-part training manual titled, Design of Underground Installations in Rock. This startling

18:27.280 --> 18:32.240
series assumes the pre-existence of underground facilities. The report states, quote,

18:32.240 --> 18:37.600
vital government installations have been placed underground as exemplified by the Richie Project,

18:37.600 --> 18:43.200
end quote. Many of these facilities were designed as command and control centers and survival bunkers

18:43.200 --> 18:49.440
for nuclear attacks. These are known as continuity of government sites. Raven Rock qualifies as one

18:49.440 --> 18:55.920
such continuity of government or COG DUM. Design of underground installations in rock additionally

18:55.920 --> 19:02.320
makes some statements of extreme relevance to the testimonies of Dumbs and UFOs. Some installations

19:02.320 --> 19:07.040
listed by the Army were to be shallow, while, quote, more important equipment and facilities

19:07.040 --> 19:12.880
essential to defense may be installed in deeper workings that are likely to be long and tunnel-like,

19:12.880 --> 19:19.280
occupying one or several stories, end quote. The report detailed enormous underground facilities

19:19.280 --> 19:25.360
featuring 50 by 50 feet tunnels and chambers as much as 100 feet high, even stating, quote,

19:25.360 --> 19:30.720
truck or rail traffic might be important, end quote. The Army even cautioned, quote,

19:30.720 --> 19:37.840
landscape scars, roads and portal structures, aka entrances, should be as inconspicuous as possible.

19:37.840 --> 19:43.120
Camouflage should be considered, end quote. This is of extreme consequence when discussing

19:43.120 --> 19:48.720
testimonies such as MS, who detailed the entrance to the Dugway Stiff as a small building in the

19:48.720 --> 19:54.960
middle of nowhere. In 1963, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a manual titled,

19:55.040 --> 20:00.640
Utilization of Nuclear Power Plants in Underground Installations. This manual discussed

20:00.640 --> 20:05.680
self-contained nuclear-powered underground facilities with button-up diesel secondary

20:05.680 --> 20:13.040
systems. Critically, in 1964, the Army Corps of Engineers or COE proposed 12 massive structures

20:13.040 --> 20:19.840
to be built up to 4,000 feet underground. There are two sites here of massive importance to our

20:19.840 --> 20:26.320
investigation, one facility below Yuma County, Arizona, to be accessed via a vertical or incline

20:26.320 --> 20:32.080
shaft. Such entry points are common amongst claims of UFO dum, such as the Dugway Dumb,

20:32.080 --> 20:37.840
whose entrance is purported to be a vertical elevator shaft. In Stephen Greer's DPI archive,

20:37.840 --> 20:42.000
who fans of this channel will know I have extracted a tremendous amount of information

20:42.000 --> 20:47.280
and worthwhile investigation from, witness 10773 statement reads, quote,

20:47.280 --> 20:54.080
nose of massive research and storage facility, material of unknown origin at Yuma Proving Ground,

20:54.080 --> 20:59.760
end quote, fascinating connection here. Yuma Test Center is also home to Yuma Proving Ground,

20:59.760 --> 21:05.760
a U.S. Army major range and test facility base, similar to Dugway Proving Ground's Army MRTFB,

21:05.760 --> 21:11.920
the West Desert Test Center. Yuma Proving Ground is also run by Army Test and Evaluation Command.

21:11.920 --> 21:17.520
Indeed, it is no stretch to assume if a stiff exists under one of these Army MRTFBs,

21:17.520 --> 21:21.200
an equally impressive facility likely exists below the other.

21:21.200 --> 21:27.280
Second here is Site III in Inyo County, California, to be accessed via incline shaft.

21:27.280 --> 21:33.200
Inyo County resides on the inside boundary of China Lake Naval Weapons Testing Facility.

21:33.200 --> 21:38.240
China Lake is one of the Navy's premier major range and test facility base and a location

21:38.240 --> 21:43.600
spoken of on myriad occasions as an underground legacy program location.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.240
China Lake really needs no introduction, but stay tuned as we will discuss China Lake

21:48.240 --> 21:53.840
in much more detail along with Antelope Valley. But quickly to mention, Dr. Richard Sotter

21:53.840 --> 21:58.720
received testimony from a Navy contact who served at China Lake. The witness confirmed

21:58.720 --> 22:04.240
an impressively large and deep installation, claiming the facility extends one mile deep

22:04.240 --> 22:09.120
and contains, quote, weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons, end quote.

22:09.120 --> 22:16.080
Alongside the US Army's COE, the US Navy is also deeply entwined with underground and possibly

22:16.080 --> 22:21.840
undersea bases, but that's another story for another day. In 1972, Naval Facilities

22:21.840 --> 22:26.880
Engineering Command issued a report titled, Sub-Surface Deployment of Naval Facilities,

22:26.880 --> 22:31.600
discussing several Navy installations to be placed underground. These include

22:31.600 --> 22:37.680
administration, medical, aircraft maintenance, ammo storage, and miscellaneous storage facilities.

22:37.680 --> 22:42.320
The US Navy Seabees additionally maintain underground installations between the

22:42.320 --> 22:48.000
Presidential Camp David and CIA facility Camp Peary, which we will discuss later on.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.360
In 1947, US Air Material Command requested Nazi technicians for construction of

22:53.360 --> 22:59.200
underground facilities. In 1989, Lloyd Dusha admitted numerous underground installations

22:59.200 --> 23:06.080
existed and were classified. This means stiffs of interest were built from 1947 to 1949,

23:06.080 --> 23:11.840
a 42-year period. We can also assume some facilities were built before 1961 where the

23:11.840 --> 23:16.800
five-part Army-COE document assumes the existence of such facilities.

23:16.800 --> 23:23.040
One such example here may be Groom Lake Area 51 that was built in the 50s on the site of a former

23:23.040 --> 23:29.360
Boron mine. After all, a 1991 DARPA report details secret cavities may be found in

23:29.360 --> 23:35.200
conjunction with underground mines. However, due to the existence of literature on described future

23:35.200 --> 23:43.200
plans for massive bases post-1961 that really hold our interest, we can assume from 1961 to 1989

23:43.200 --> 23:46.400
the majority of our stiffs of interest were constructed.

23:46.800 --> 23:57.760
Dumbs are not a new subject to the study of UFOs or my channel. I myself have talked a tremendous

23:57.760 --> 24:03.520
amount of the alleged DARSE Defense Advanced Research Center, a 10-story underground location

24:03.520 --> 24:09.360
built under Area 51 relayed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet that dealt with alien

24:09.360 --> 24:15.680
reproduction vehicles, including the TR-3B. I have also spoken on the enigmatic Northrop

24:15.680 --> 24:22.720
Tahan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities that have since at least 1987

24:22.720 --> 24:28.480
been accused by excellent researchers such as Bill Hamilton as housing UFO legacy programs,

24:28.480 --> 24:32.960
and don't worry, we will touch on these facilities in much more detail later.

24:32.960 --> 24:39.520
Quite recently, I've discussed the Dugway Dumb as relayed by Witness MS and even provided images

24:39.520 --> 24:45.360
and details of the exact alleged entrance to the facility, which exists as an elevator shaft

24:45.360 --> 24:50.720
concealed by a tiny building in the middle of nowhere Dugway near German village.

24:50.720 --> 24:56.560
As strange as that might seem, a 1991 paper issued by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research

24:56.560 --> 25:01.760
Project Agency and US Army Missile Command titled Development of Inspection and Detection

25:01.760 --> 25:07.520
Techniques for Hidden Cavities. This document served to train field nuclear weapons inspectors to

25:07.520 --> 25:14.320
identify underground clandestine test complexes in developing nuclear nations. The report plainly

25:14.320 --> 25:19.840
states buildings of various size can provide cover for shafts or other openings to a secret

25:19.840 --> 25:26.000
underground cavity, sounds similar to MS, no? And lastly, I have relayed the testimony of Randy

25:26.000 --> 25:31.280
Anderson in the underground facility under the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane housing the

25:31.280 --> 25:37.440
alleged Off-World Technologies Division. The subject of underground UFO legacy programs rose

25:37.440 --> 25:43.680
to prominence in 1989 with the claims of Bob Lazar and reverse engineering under Site 4,

25:43.680 --> 25:50.400
as well as the Dulce base fiasco where starting in 1979, Paul Benowitz was fed disinformation

25:50.400 --> 25:56.640
of a joint human extraterrestrial base under Dulce, New Mexico. Both S4 and Dulce are worthy

25:56.640 --> 26:02.400
of further investigation. In fact, I believe S4 to be a very real location, but due to the

26:02.400 --> 26:07.200
controversy around these accounts, discussions of these sites will be largely omitted from today's

26:07.200 --> 26:13.920
discussions. The first true mention of DUMs and UFOs I can find is from Look Magazine in an article

26:13.920 --> 26:21.200
titled Is This The Real Flying Saucer? dated 1955. The article discussed a Canadian company

26:21.200 --> 26:26.080
constructing a flying saucer while also depicting a facility built underneath a hill with a

26:26.080 --> 26:32.240
vertical shaft to the surface allowing the departure of flying saucers. Further rumors of UFOs and

26:32.240 --> 26:38.400
DUMs wouldn't really arise until the 1970s, so this article is indeed intriguing. Leonard

26:38.400 --> 26:45.360
Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval Status Reports 1-7 is a body of work I often praise extensively.

26:45.360 --> 26:51.040
After all, Stringfield is in my opinion one of the greatest UFO investigators of all time.

26:51.040 --> 26:57.120
His work on UFO retrieval incidents and operations spanned from 1978 to 1994 and

26:57.120 --> 27:02.080
relays some of the earliest mentions I can find of deep underground legacy operations.

27:02.080 --> 27:07.040
Let's briefly explore a few. One such intriguing report is an anonymous letter

27:07.040 --> 27:13.840
Stringfield received 12 February 1974. The letter highlighted secret research on UFOs

27:13.840 --> 27:20.160
taking place at a secret underground complex below Gray Army Airfield and Fort Hood, Texas.

27:20.160 --> 27:25.760
According to the witness, the complex is shared with ICBM silos built into a small mountain.

27:25.760 --> 27:30.720
This is fascinating as later in the project we will discuss how numerous DUMs were constructed

27:30.720 --> 27:36.800
primarily as ICBM sites. The witness described a section of the mountain would open up onto a

27:36.800 --> 27:42.240
jet interceptor runway, which was once accidentally observed by a private pilot making a forced

27:42.240 --> 27:47.280
landing over this restricted air corridor. This underground facility, according to the witness,

27:47.280 --> 27:52.080
was tied with NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, Wright Patterson Air Force Base,

27:52.160 --> 27:57.520
Ohio, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, and others.

27:58.080 --> 28:03.200
And this is where the anonymous account gets very interesting. The witness stated the complex

28:03.200 --> 28:08.480
employed a squadron of unmarked helicopters dispatched quote when the need arises and quote

28:08.480 --> 28:14.560
codenamed the blue boys. This sounds incredibly similar to UFO recovery rapid reaction units

28:14.560 --> 28:20.080
I have spoken about in numerous crash retrieval cases such as the Blue Berets in the 1965

28:20.160 --> 28:25.040
Kecksburg, Pennsylvania case. The choppers additionally carried a new type of missile the

28:25.040 --> 28:30.400
source had been informed had been used on UFOs but a new system had been in development which

28:30.400 --> 28:36.800
would be far more efficient. This was an electronic warfare system designed to disable UFOs under

28:36.800 --> 28:43.040
quote unquote controlled conditions. This letter would arrive to Stringfield's desk in 1974 but

28:43.040 --> 28:47.920
now in 2025 we have heard the whistleblower testimony of Jake Barber where he discussed

28:47.920 --> 28:55.760
EMP type weapons designed to bring down UFOs over the enigmatic range. In your time in deployment

28:55.760 --> 29:01.040
you met certain people from an aerospace company, didn't you? Yes I did. Now it's also part of the

29:01.040 --> 29:05.760
constraints you operate under that you can't name that aerospace company. There's no good reason to

29:05.760 --> 29:10.960
name them even if I wasn't constrained. What were they doing there? Well they were supporting us with

29:10.960 --> 29:21.440
some new weapons technology that could be used to disable vehicles and aircraft. I can disclose

29:21.440 --> 29:25.600
this my understanding is that they were essentially using it was actually I think it's a matter of

29:25.600 --> 29:30.880
public record that microwave weapons pulse microwave weapons were being used at that time.

29:30.880 --> 29:37.200
Correct there were some early prototypes that were being used at that time and I met individuals

29:37.200 --> 29:41.760
that were there representing the companies that were providing that service to the government,

29:41.760 --> 29:47.040
made some friends and those relationships led to opportunities later in the California desert

29:47.600 --> 29:52.160
where I began my journey. Leonard would actually see a volume of reports regarding

29:52.160 --> 29:58.320
underground complexes at Fort Hood including a USAF Lieutenant Colonel who relate to him in 1975

29:58.320 --> 30:04.400
of an underground project that took place at Fort Hood. In 1976 Stringfield met an individual

30:04.480 --> 30:10.080
from McGregor Texas who claimed his father had worked beneath Fort Hood on the UFO program.

30:10.080 --> 30:14.880
This second-hand witness relayed a quote from his father stating quote the technology that is being

30:14.880 --> 30:19.680
applied in this underground complex would remind someone of a science fiction thriller. It is

30:19.680 --> 30:26.400
unbelievable what they know and what they can do from this area. Spanning the late 70s into the 80s

30:26.400 --> 30:31.120
Stringfield received myriad reports of an underground facility beneath Wright Patterson

30:31.120 --> 30:36.880
Air Force Base housing preserved non-human biologics. One such account was relayed from

30:36.880 --> 30:43.680
witness JK who worked at a Nike missile site in Wilmington, Ohio. JK claimed to have seen nine

30:43.680 --> 30:51.520
alien bodies under Wright Pad in 1966 encased in glass frozen to preserve. JK also claimed

30:51.520 --> 30:56.960
recovered craft were housed at McDill Air Force Base Langley Air Force Base in Seymour Johnson

30:56.960 --> 31:03.520
Navy Training Center outside of Norfolk, Virginia. These locations purportedly all housed craft and

31:03.520 --> 31:09.600
sometimes biologics and underground hangers to conceal material from military and politicians.

31:09.600 --> 31:14.320
Stringfield heard similar accounts of biologics under Wright Pat relayed second hand from one

31:14.320 --> 31:20.720
TS who allegedly witnessed bodies in the early 1950s. TS were amongst a handful that relayed

31:20.720 --> 31:26.480
such stories. Leonard Stringfield would also once receive an anonymous undated letter from a

31:26.480 --> 31:31.920
U.S. airman who is stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The source relayed rumors and

31:31.920 --> 31:38.640
stories of UFOs being stored in the Manzano storage area in remote Kirtland. Remember if you will,

31:38.640 --> 31:44.640
Kirtland is home to Sandia National Labs, FFRDC, which ranging from the interplanetary

31:44.640 --> 31:50.240
phenomenon unit report to accusations of reverse engineering a propulsion device for the TR-3B

31:50.240 --> 31:56.560
by Edgar Fouchet has stood as a high probability candidate in UFO RDT&E programs.

31:56.560 --> 32:02.400
Manzano Mountain Underground Facility is no myth either. While researching for his 2001 book

32:02.400 --> 32:07.760
Underwater and Underground Bases, solder received FOIA documents of two underground

32:07.760 --> 32:12.960
facilities below Manzano. While these documents of course say nothing about UFO storage,

32:12.960 --> 32:17.680
it is fascinating to see solder confirm the rumors of an underground installation beneath

32:17.680 --> 32:23.280
Kirtland. Lastly, I want to reference an anonymous letter to Leonard Stringfield I have covered before.

32:23.280 --> 32:29.360
This is dated March 14, 1975, which claims to recount the testimony of one Lieutenant Colonel

32:29.360 --> 32:35.840
Sims, Asunim. I previously discussed this letter in reference to the project on ED. An Edwards

32:35.840 --> 32:41.680
Air Force Base 412th Test Group Electronic Warfare Test Director who claimed to the existence of a

32:41.760 --> 32:47.680
joint UFO reverse engineering program operating between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada

32:47.680 --> 32:53.040
Test and Training Range. Viewers of this channel will know I consider ED to be one of the most

32:53.040 --> 32:58.960
critical UFO legacy witnesses of all time and as a quick side note, ED also referenced attending

32:58.960 --> 33:04.400
the S-4 site. This letter was referenced due to the mention of Handscom Air Force Base in the

33:04.400 --> 33:11.120
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An Air Base and University where ED worked from 2002 to 2005

33:11.120 --> 33:17.520
on foreign military assets. Amongst the intriguing mentions of contractors, FFRDCs,

33:17.520 --> 33:23.040
UARCs, and air bases involved in UFO research and investigation, the source relayed Lieutenant

33:23.040 --> 33:28.160
Colonel Sims speaking of several computer banks hidden within underground installations scattered

33:28.160 --> 33:33.280
across the US, housing sophisticated computer equipment, electronic instrumentation, and

33:33.280 --> 33:38.320
mobile radar units. According to Sims, these underground installations employ, quote,

33:38.320 --> 33:43.120
squadrons of unmarked helicopters which have sophisticated instrumentation on board that

33:43.120 --> 33:49.200
are dispatched to areas of UFO activity to monitor these craft or airlift them out of the area if

33:49.200 --> 33:54.960
one has malfunctioned, end quote. This sounds quite similar to the Blue Boy's rapid reaction unit

33:54.960 --> 34:00.000
related to Stringfield, does it not? But perhaps we have other confirming evidence so let's also

34:00.000 --> 34:05.200
reference the book Trinity's Children Living Along America's Nuclear Highways. The authors

34:05.200 --> 34:10.880
of this book state, quote, there are more crazed supercomputers in New Mexico, an Air Force computer

34:10.880 --> 34:16.080
expert once said than anywhere else. They're here at the Weapon Center referring to Kirtland,

34:16.080 --> 34:20.560
they're across the street at Sandia, they're at Los Alamos up the highway, and they're at the,

34:20.560 --> 34:26.320
quote, underground places nobody knows about. Intriguing as we already know Kirtland and by

34:26.320 --> 34:33.360
extension Sandia employ at least two underground facilities in the Manzano Mountains. Los Alamos

34:33.360 --> 34:39.040
National Labs additionally employs a deep underground installation. Dr. Sotter had quite

34:39.040 --> 34:43.600
an interesting engagement with Los Alamos. He repeatedly attempted to FOIA the Department

34:43.600 --> 34:48.480
of Energy for information on underground facilities and tunnels beneath Los Alamos.

34:48.480 --> 34:54.480
The DOE continuously responded there were none. Eventually though, the DOE provided Sotter a

34:54.480 --> 35:01.920
badly blurred phototastic copy of an article by Earl Zimmerman titled, LASL's Unusual Underground

35:01.920 --> 35:08.320
Lab, which described an underground facility built in the late 1940s. This article was undated

35:08.320 --> 35:14.480
and of uncertain origin, however Zimmerman can be found labeled as a press bureau member from 1963

35:14.480 --> 35:22.000
to 1965 in a 2020 Los Alamos organizational chart. Dr. Sotter additionally met with a businessman

35:22.000 --> 35:27.280
who relayed his experience in visiting Los Alamos in the company of a highly clear associate.

35:27.280 --> 35:31.440
The businessman was privy to wherever his esteemed colleague went without question,

35:31.440 --> 35:37.440
the individual claimed 75% of Los Alamos's facilities are underground and extend as far

35:37.440 --> 35:48.880
as one mile underground. In relation to TUOs and UFOs, so far we have covered very real

35:48.880 --> 35:54.880
stiffs under Kirtland slash Sandia and Los Alamos while also discussing the possible existence of

35:54.880 --> 36:01.440
facilities existing under Wright Patterson, Fort Hood slash Gray Army airfield Yuma County,

36:01.440 --> 36:06.480
China Lake as well as the Nevada test site under the Nevada test and training range.

36:06.480 --> 36:13.040
Now onto one of the most critical areas of my research, the Antelope Valley, California.

36:13.040 --> 36:18.320
For this section, we will reference the work of both Dr. Sotter as well as the late Bill Hamilton,

36:18.320 --> 36:23.600
a tremendous UFO researcher. Hamilton served as a true pioneer of the field,

36:23.600 --> 36:28.880
serving as the first researcher to ever produce the term and a public image of ARV,

36:28.880 --> 36:35.040
and even handed incredible witnesses such as Mark McCandlish and Bill Uhouse to Stephen Greer.

36:35.040 --> 36:41.920
Hamilton's excellent book, Cosmic Top Secret, an ultra rare early 1990s lecture recorded for VHS

36:41.920 --> 36:47.840
titled UFOs and Underground Bases, offers us keen insights into Hamilton's research on

36:47.840 --> 36:53.840
Dumbs and specific area of interest, the Antelope Valley. In fact, Hamilton produced a map

36:53.840 --> 36:59.440
related to him by sources of connected underground UFO facilities in the American Southwest.

36:59.440 --> 37:05.200
We will compare this map to existing DoD laboratories and RDT and E locations later

37:05.200 --> 37:11.200
on in this video. China Lake Naval Air Station is also quite close to Antelope Valley, so we will

37:11.200 --> 37:17.760
discuss that enigmatic facility here as well. Since the late 1980s, Hamilton's work focused on

37:17.760 --> 37:23.440
Antelope Valley, California. Many will know this region as one of the chief centers of aerospace

37:23.440 --> 37:30.160
technology, housing the infamous USAF Plant 42 Lockheed Skunkworks, the former Norton Air Force

37:30.160 --> 37:35.200
Base, the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, major installations for Northrop Grumman,

37:35.200 --> 37:40.960
Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas, as well as numerous intriguing radar cross-section facilities

37:40.960 --> 37:46.960
in the form of Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas. I have spoken on all of

37:46.960 --> 37:52.160
the aforementioned facilities and prior work. Palmdale, California within the Antelope has

37:52.160 --> 37:57.920
served as an unrivaled US military slash private contractor classified aircraft production and

37:57.920 --> 38:03.120
maintenance location. The region has produced many of the United States most famous advanced

38:03.120 --> 38:11.360
aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk,

38:11.360 --> 38:16.880
and F-35 Lightning. The Antelope Valley and the City of Palmdale have also served as a

38:16.880 --> 38:22.080
critical pillar of my research. Whether this be Norton Air Force Base serving as the location

38:22.080 --> 38:26.800
were primary witness Brad S observed the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle,

38:26.800 --> 38:32.080
witness Ed disclosing his work for the 412th test group serving as test director for reverse

38:32.080 --> 38:38.320
engineered vehicles out of Edwards. Edgar Fouchet, who stated pilots of the TR-3B reverse engineered

38:38.400 --> 38:44.240
triangle ARV were plucked from the Edwards 412th Test Pilot School or the alleged project

38:44.240 --> 38:49.600
red light out of Edwards which served to act alongside Area 51 to test reverse engineered

38:49.600 --> 38:55.840
vehicles very similar to the claims of Ed. Antelope Valley is the most consequential location that

38:55.840 --> 39:01.680
has ever come up in all of my research. The late Hamilton was obsessed with the radar cross-section

39:01.680 --> 39:07.200
facilities mentioned above. Specifically the Northrop Tehan installation sometimes referred to as

39:07.200 --> 39:12.880
the Tehachapi facility or Ant Hill. Due to the rumors of incredible amounts of underground tunnels

39:12.880 --> 39:19.200
beneath the installation, in my video on Northrop I investigated this RCS facility in great detail.

39:19.200 --> 39:25.120
Thanks to the research of Dr. Sotter we know the Northrop Tehan RCS does indeed have an underground

39:25.120 --> 39:31.200
facility. Just as does Hellendale and McDonald Douglas, the question is how big, how deep,

39:31.200 --> 39:36.960
and what do they do? Some rumors persist of up to 42 levels with underground tunnels connecting

39:36.960 --> 39:42.480
the facility to Edwards and other installations. The concept of a corporate dumb should come as no

39:42.480 --> 39:48.400
surprise to anyone. In 1981 the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, yes AT&T,

39:48.400 --> 39:54.560
revealed several underground emergency centers. Believe it or not AT&T itself has been historically

39:54.560 --> 40:00.160
implicated in non-human technology transfer but that is not our topic for today. These underground

40:00.160 --> 40:05.600
centers exist 40 feet below ground and feature three story centers with data banks, dorms,

40:05.600 --> 40:11.440
and kitchens. One such location is reported to exist in Catrone County, 180 miles near

40:11.440 --> 40:19.120
Sandia National Labs. This is not surprising seen from 1949 to 1993 AT&T in its subsidiary

40:19.120 --> 40:24.640
Western Electric ran Sandia National Labs at Kirtland at the order of President Harry S. Truman

40:24.640 --> 40:30.240
for the Department of Energy. Indeed as recently as 1970 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey

40:30.240 --> 40:36.400
operated an emergency center 300 feet underground near Hudson, New York. This location that more

40:36.400 --> 40:41.760
recently held corporate reports featured dining halls and 50 sleeping rooms for key company

40:41.760 --> 40:48.320
officials. But back to Tehan and quickly for those who don't know what exactly is a radar cross-section

40:48.320 --> 40:54.160
facility. To summarize these facilities utilize high frequency radio waves to test aircraft's radar

40:54.160 --> 40:59.360
signatures. This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing

40:59.360 --> 41:04.880
radar cross-section. The site features large runways and pylons raised from underground on

41:04.880 --> 41:10.640
concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast aircraft and materials with radar. Many RCS

41:10.640 --> 41:15.280
facilities including the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War.

41:15.280 --> 41:20.800
This led the majority of the installation being built underground to hide RCS pylons equipment,

41:20.800 --> 41:26.080
models, and technology away from Soviet spy satellites. Numerous researchers over the

41:26.080 --> 41:31.280
years have accused the Northrop Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy

41:31.280 --> 41:36.480
program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft.

41:36.480 --> 41:41.200
The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrance for the

41:41.200 --> 41:46.400
Ant Hill Dumb as well as personally been flown over these sites and observed the electromagnetic

41:46.400 --> 41:51.440
pulse weapon systems that are used to down craft. Now interestingly the Senate Intelligence and

41:51.440 --> 41:56.880
Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people

41:56.880 --> 42:03.360
and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it.

42:04.640 --> 42:09.440
I had known about it since the 90s but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's

42:09.440 --> 42:17.840
classified airspace and very sensitive. So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

42:18.480 --> 42:26.240
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.

42:26.880 --> 42:32.960
They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-gravidic anti-grab. The diamond on the

42:32.960 --> 42:36.800
left you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't

42:36.800 --> 42:41.840
need to run and get there's not an aerodynamic. They just go boom up but they're placed so different

42:41.840 --> 42:46.000
diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these we don't have time to go through

42:46.000 --> 42:52.000
and that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic

42:52.720 --> 42:59.040
weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict, right?

42:59.680 --> 43:05.120
When discussing the RCS facilities and in particular Hamilton's obsession with Tehan,

43:05.120 --> 43:11.840
some may remember the XF-131 Super Sentinel. This incredible triangular ARV was drawn by

43:11.920 --> 43:17.360
forensic artist Bill McDonald and later featured in season one of the X-Files.

43:17.360 --> 43:22.000
According to McDonald, the craft design was relayed to him from two Northrop Tehan and

43:22.000 --> 43:27.440
two Lockheed Hellendale engineers who were jaded from the intense secrecy from which they operated.

43:27.440 --> 43:32.720
I personally have spoken to McDonald on numerous occasions regarding this triangular ARV out of

43:32.720 --> 43:38.720
the Antelope Valley and put much credence into this testimony. For years Hamilton compiled first-hand

43:38.720 --> 43:43.680
witness testimony regarding Antelope Valley and specifically the Northrop Tehachapi site.

43:43.680 --> 43:49.840
Let's briefly investigate a few of these testimonies. A local man with property on 170th Street,

43:49.840 --> 43:55.440
west of Tehan, reported to Hamilton of the ground opening like a missile silo where a flying saucer

43:55.440 --> 44:01.600
took off. Edwards Air Force Office of Special Investigation silenced this witness. UFO researcher

44:01.600 --> 44:07.200
Dr. Richard Boylan alongside the first-hand source of Bill McDonald have additionally accused Tehan

44:07.280 --> 44:12.880
as a manufacturing site for reverse engineered vehicles including the X-F-131 Super Sentinel

44:12.880 --> 44:18.720
and anti-gravity disc dubbed by Boylan the Great Pumpkin. A contractor named Chuck relayed his

44:18.720 --> 44:23.760
experience digging the underground tunnels beneath the Ant Hill to Hamilton. This source claimed

44:23.760 --> 44:30.000
tunnels in the Dumb had round doorways with few doors and red and green lights for ID and entry.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.720
An intriguing source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on Project Star Talk at Tehan.

44:34.720 --> 44:39.440
This project involved lasers in a big building underground for the purpose of constructing

44:39.440 --> 44:46.000
systems to quote-unquote bring in UFOs. The source mentioned scalar technology, a concept Stephen

44:46.000 --> 44:52.080
Greer would later on discuss for decades as a weapon source to down UFOs. The Star Talk informer

44:52.080 --> 44:57.120
also claimed to work at McDonnell Douglas Stiff where he observed a UFO held in an underground

44:57.120 --> 45:03.280
hangar. This name was very hard to make out by a 144p documentary but one Hamilton informer

45:03.280 --> 45:09.120
went by the name Gobern who claimed to work at Tehan, Hellendale and the Nevada test and training

45:09.120 --> 45:15.200
range. This source relayed to Hamilton he worked with alien technology that deeply frightened him.

45:15.200 --> 45:21.040
According to the source on-site personnel would rotate every 14 to 16 days living and working

45:21.040 --> 45:26.800
on site and there existed a command center under Haystack Butte which connected to the Ant Hill.

45:26.800 --> 45:31.760
Hamilton had numerous other informers who would discuss experimental discs being flown out of

45:31.760 --> 45:37.280
Edwards airfield, extraterrestrial discs being held under Edwards and underground UFO work below

45:37.280 --> 45:42.480
a hangar on Edwards North Base. Many of these informants would discuss ground vehicles like

45:42.480 --> 45:47.840
electric cars within the dumps and maglev train systems connecting the base to others. We will

45:47.840 --> 45:53.840
of course discuss this much later on. From his data and sources Hamilton learned of a supposed

45:53.840 --> 45:59.840
massive complex of underground facilities in the Antelope Valley engaged with UFO testing storage

45:59.840 --> 46:05.840
and material exploitation. All connected via tunnels and transport systems these facilities

46:05.840 --> 46:11.680
included Tahachapi, McDonnell Douglas, Hellendale, George Air Force Base Edwards, the NASA rocket

46:11.680 --> 46:17.200
test site and China Lake. A network of joint USG and corporate facilities all connected in the

46:17.200 --> 46:22.160
Antelope Valley dedicated to the storage and exploitation of UFOs has proven to be quite

46:22.160 --> 46:28.320
a common theory since the late 80s and early 1990s work of Hamilton. I'd once again like to reference

46:28.320 --> 46:34.480
Stephen Greer witness AH. I have discussed in multiple projects AH a Boeing insider with numerous

46:34.480 --> 46:40.400
connections to UFO legacy programs has historically and likely to this day served as a primary source

46:40.400 --> 46:46.000
of information for Greer. In his 2000 tape testimony AH delivered to Greer much of the

46:46.000 --> 46:50.880
information Greer still discusses to this day including reference to a massive facility

46:50.880 --> 46:56.960
existing below Dugway. AH additionally discussed a complex of underground facilities near Anzo

46:56.960 --> 47:01.520
California just south of Antelope Valley while also addressing a critical Northrop

47:01.520 --> 47:07.680
underground facility named of course Tehan. Did you share with you any other information on other

47:07.680 --> 47:15.120
facilities that dealt with this issue in US or abroad? Yes he mentioned there's a base here in

47:15.120 --> 47:22.960
California near Anzo California and there's another base in the deserts of I believe he said

47:23.280 --> 47:33.200
Tacone or Tejon. I believe he said Tejon. I believe that's the word that he used there's a base

47:34.880 --> 47:43.200
near Lancaster and Palmdale area and near this is very funny it's near Northrop there's an

47:43.200 --> 47:50.960
underground area out there too that he was aware of and but he particularly mentioned and stayed

47:50.960 --> 47:56.160
focused on Anzo California there's some underground areas up there too that they're

47:57.360 --> 48:04.160
researching some of this technology and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.

48:05.040 --> 48:10.160
Of this network of proposed facilities one possible dumb stands out from the rest

48:10.160 --> 48:15.360
Edwards Air Force Base. As mentioned in nearly every project Edward serves as home to the

48:15.680 --> 48:22.000
412th test group a major range and test facility base. Witness Ed a vetted and accomplished USAT

48:22.000 --> 48:27.680
veteran claimed Edwards and the Nevada test and training range specifically Nellis Air Force Base

48:27.680 --> 48:34.400
in Area 51 slash Groom Lake which is actually run by an Edwards 412th detachment runs a joint UFO

48:34.400 --> 48:39.840
reverse engineering program. Outside of the claims of Hamilton's informants regarding Edwards and

48:39.840 --> 48:44.080
craft stored in underground installations there are many fascinating testimonies and

48:44.080 --> 48:49.280
avenues of research we might pursue. Remember how one source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on

48:49.280 --> 48:54.480
the Ant Hill installation under Tejon in Antelope Valley. The source claimed the installation's

48:54.480 --> 49:00.240
command center existed under Edwards Haystack Butte. This sentiment is shared by the controversial

49:00.240 --> 49:05.280
and enigmatic whistleblower Dr. Michael Wolfe who claimed as a UAP consultant to the National

49:05.280 --> 49:10.640
Security Council he heard live extraterrestrials were kept under Haystack Butte Edwards.

49:10.640 --> 49:16.320
Test facilities are built into an on Haystack Butte east of Edwards indeed these facilities

49:16.320 --> 49:21.520
are run alongside a primary field lab at the remote northeast corner of Edwards by the Air Force

49:21.520 --> 49:27.600
Research Lab's Aerospace Systems Directorate. AFRL Edwards 412th Test Wing and NASA Flight

49:27.600 --> 49:33.200
Research Facility work together at Edwards to plan conduct analyze and report on all flight

49:33.200 --> 49:38.640
and ground testing of aircraft weapon systems software and components as well as modeling and

49:38.640 --> 49:43.920
simulation for the USAF. Since facilities are built into the Butte it is no stretch to assume

49:43.920 --> 49:50.000
locations are built under the Haystack Butte and remember this USAF AFRL rocket propulsion

49:50.000 --> 49:55.200
division and their rocket test labs on Lumen Ridge were named by Hamilton and his informants as

49:55.200 --> 50:01.200
featuring a stiff location connected to the wider Edwards underground complex. This lab features a

50:01.200 --> 50:05.840
number of underground missile silos but the extent to which the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory

50:06.320 --> 50:11.600
underground is unknown however and very interesting numerous studies out of the Air Force Rocket

50:11.600 --> 50:17.120
Propulsion Lab have shown a heavy interest in anti-gravity propulsion is this location definitely

50:17.120 --> 50:23.760
UFO legacy related unknown but a strong argument can be made from witness testimony and lastly a bit

50:23.760 --> 50:30.240
north to Antelope is China Lake Naval Air Weapon Station as we showed in a 1964 Army Corps of

50:30.240 --> 50:35.760
Engineers study titled Feasibility of Constructing Large Underground Cavities Inyo County which

50:35.760 --> 50:41.280
shares territory with China Lake was considered for underground purposes the underground cavity of

50:41.280 --> 50:47.520
interest was 4,000 feet deep and it is unknown if this facility was built however numerous witness

50:47.520 --> 50:53.840
testimony may give us some idea as we also discussed above Dr. Sotter had been given testimony by Navy

50:53.840 --> 50:58.560
Veterans stationed at China Lake who not only claimed the facility goes one mile deep but

50:58.560 --> 51:04.160
weapons work is conducted on quote weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons end quote

51:04.160 --> 51:09.120
Hamilton himself also had a source who allegedly served as an aerospace engineer consultant to

51:09.120 --> 51:14.400
NASA and Colonel this unnamed Colonel claimed he worked at an underground installation at China

51:14.400 --> 51:19.520
Lake Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada test site these locations were according to the source

51:19.520 --> 51:24.880
connected via a maglev train system from which he would often enter through a dump beneath White

51:24.960 --> 51:30.560
Sands missile range I put stock in this testimony due to speaking myself to a witness who claimed

51:30.560 --> 51:36.720
to travel via underground train system from a fort in Texas to White Sands this source an army

51:36.720 --> 51:42.960
officer in the 2010s claimed the train speed and acceleration were so great it reminded him of his

51:42.960 --> 51:50.000
fear of flying we also have Ed and the mention of Edwards and the NTTR China Lake is not mentioned

51:50.000 --> 51:54.640
in his testimony however it stands to reason the very near China Lake which serves as the

51:54.640 --> 52:01.520
Navy's largest single land holding representing 85% of the Navy's weapons and armaments are DT&E

52:01.520 --> 52:08.160
programs could likely see crossover TUO programs with the USAF if these programs exchange nonhuman

52:08.160 --> 52:13.680
craft materials and research it stands to reason such transactions would be conducted underground

52:13.680 --> 52:19.600
to maintain secrecy I would in the future like to do an entire video on China Lake so hang tight

52:19.600 --> 52:25.440
corporate and military installations do indeed exist below Antelope Valley again the question

52:25.440 --> 52:31.280
is do these sites deal with technologies of unknown origin and exploitation programs Antelope

52:31.280 --> 52:39.200
and Palmdale are home to aerospace juggernauts and myriad DOD RDT&E and MRTFBs and have for decades

52:39.200 --> 52:45.680
featured numerous testimonies of ARV underground installations and claims of UFO legacy programs

52:45.680 --> 52:50.960
due to these factors plus witnesses who have told me they have traveled below the Antelope Valley

52:50.960 --> 52:57.600
I am inclined to conclude such an anthill if so to speak does in fact exist to work on UFO legacy

52:57.600 --> 53:07.440
programs the vast majority of our focus today is the American Southwest and endless claims of

53:07.440 --> 53:13.760
underground UFO research in RDT&E but quickly I do want to look east we have already discussed

53:13.840 --> 53:20.880
STIFs used by the CIA and NSA under cover of the Army and Navy respectively but what about UFO

53:20.880 --> 53:26.240
STIFs for this reason I would like to look to the United States Capitol and address the deep

53:26.240 --> 53:32.400
underground command center the DUCC was a stiff below the Pentagon that was never built however I

53:32.400 --> 53:38.160
am not sure just how true that statement is now an acknowledged stiff under the Pentagon does indeed

53:38.160 --> 53:43.120
exist the national military command center responsible for generating emergency action

53:43.120 --> 53:48.160
messages to missile control launch centers nuclear subs and battlefield commanders this

53:48.160 --> 53:55.280
NMCC was set to serve as an interim facility for the never built DUCC the deep underground command

53:55.280 --> 54:02.160
center was first proposed in 1963 three weeks before the assassination of JFK declassified top

54:02.160 --> 54:08.640
secret documents dated 7 november 63 detail former secretary of defense Robert McNamara proposing

54:08.640 --> 54:13.920
meetings to discuss the national underground command center these plans for the national or

54:13.920 --> 54:19.680
deep underground command center detailed a complex command center built 3,500 feet below

54:19.680 --> 54:25.920
Washington DC this location would be built to withstand direct hits of 200 to 300 megaton

54:25.920 --> 54:31.600
warheads that penetrate 70 to 100 feet below the surface before detonation two separate

54:31.600 --> 54:38.080
facilities were proposed an austere facility with 10,000 total square feet and 5,000 operating

54:38.080 --> 54:44.720
square feet accommodating 40 people at a depth of 3,500 feet this would cost over 110 million

54:44.720 --> 54:52.160
dollars or 1.1 billion today the second was a moderate sized facility with 100,000 total

54:52.160 --> 54:58.640
square feet and 50,000 operating square feet accommodating 300 people at a depth of 3,500

54:58.640 --> 55:06.080
feet this would cost 310 million or over 3.2 billion dollars today the joint chiefs interestingly

55:06.080 --> 55:11.520
proposed the austere facility to be too small the operation capsule of the center would be

55:11.520 --> 55:16.960
near the pentagon and an access elevator would descend 3,500 feet underground from the pentagon

55:17.360 --> 55:22.960
installation this may seem like a massive undertaking however the memorandum stated quote

55:22.960 --> 55:28.800
there is little argument that the construction of a du cc is technically feasible end quote to

55:28.800 --> 55:34.400
quote the memo again quote the nature of the du cc regardless of the initial size selected

55:34.400 --> 55:40.240
lends itself to later expansion end quote once linden b johnson took office a second

55:40.240 --> 55:48.320
memorandum was issued 16 january 1964 from wall rosto to mcgeorge bundy stating the du cc concept

55:48.320 --> 55:54.480
should proceed rosto served as a senior advisor to both kennedy and johnson an additional memo

55:54.480 --> 55:59.920
followed the same day from mcgeorge bundy to carl kason showing planning for the du cc had been

55:59.920 --> 56:05.360
going forward since the early days of the johnson admin kason was deputy special assistant for national

56:05.360 --> 56:11.760
security affairs to kennedy and possibly stayed on to advise on the du cc program the memo additionally

56:11.760 --> 56:18.000
stated kason having spoken to herald brown read the du cc brown served as director of defense

56:18.000 --> 56:24.640
research and engineering from 1961 to 1965 a last top secret memo dealing with the du cc

56:24.640 --> 56:31.920
was issued by the bureau of the budget estimated between 1963 to 1964 40 plus percent of this

56:31.920 --> 56:38.240
document is redacted was the du cc ever built conventional sources would say no however i

56:38.240 --> 56:43.840
would argue indeed it was this confidence of mine is from sources who have described to me

56:43.840 --> 56:49.840
firsthand encounters within an enormous cavernous facility below the pentagon but how does such a

56:49.840 --> 56:56.480
proposed facility deal with the subject of ufo's if the du cc was indeed built it is a publicly

56:56.480 --> 57:02.720
denied site therefore we can feasibly reckon if the site does exist it deals with subjects critical

57:02.720 --> 57:09.360
to us national security since the 1954 atomic energy agreement materials pertaining to ufo's

57:09.360 --> 57:15.440
have been misclassified as trans classified foreign nuclear materials as relayed by physicists robert

57:15.440 --> 57:21.280
sarbacher in 1950 ufo programs exist and their classification resides even higher than that of

57:21.280 --> 57:27.280
the h-bomb on this channel i've spoken in-depth at ufo legacy program operations are the ultimate

57:27.280 --> 57:33.600
secret deep-six clandestine set of programs deeply embedded within special access programs

57:33.600 --> 57:40.240
the pentagon resides near crystal city crystal city features eight of ten of the us's top defense

57:40.240 --> 57:45.680
contractors in the small neighborhood is where two-thirds of federal contracts are awarded by

57:46.400 --> 57:51.600
this location holds primary offices held by northrop grumman, lockheed martin, boeing,

57:51.600 --> 57:58.560
wrathion, general dynamics, l3, aerojet, rockadine, and more all contractors i highly suspect engage

57:58.560 --> 58:05.040
with ufo programs the neighborhood also holds or is in close proximity to numerous ffr dcs i

58:05.040 --> 58:11.040
believe are up to their eyeballs in ufo programs these include the center for naval analyses

58:11.040 --> 58:16.880
institute for defense analysis aerospace corporation and rand homeland security operations

58:16.880 --> 58:22.640
analysis center additionally crystal city is home to myriad do d research agencies including

58:22.640 --> 58:28.560
darpa office of naval research and air force office of scientific research i do believe similar to

58:28.560 --> 58:34.720
the antelope valley crystal city's amalgamation of do d entities ffr dcs and contractors is a

58:34.800 --> 58:41.520
major center of operations for ufo legacy programs perhaps due to limited airspace and usage of mrt

58:41.520 --> 58:47.680
fbs unlike the american desert in southwest crystal city is where the majority of ufo related usaps

58:47.680 --> 58:53.440
are created maintained and kept secure this is a thesis i will continue to explore in depth in

58:53.440 --> 58:59.280
the future if crystal city does indeed majorly engage with clandestine ufo unacknowledged special

58:59.360 --> 59:04.880
access programs it stands to reason such a classified effort involving do d private and

59:04.880 --> 59:08.720
semi-private entities would require a massive underground facility

59:13.840 --> 59:19.120
the idea of a major network of underground tunnels connecting dumps nationwide is often

59:19.120 --> 59:25.120
scoffed at i have no idea if the entire nation's stiffs are connected via tunnel system but a

59:25.120 --> 59:30.240
strong argument can be made complex systems of interconnecting stiffs exist in the american

59:30.240 --> 59:36.560
southwest and east coast after all in a document obtained via foya by dr richard solder we even

59:36.560 --> 59:41.840
have hard numbers from the military industrial complex of the estimated number of total personnel

59:41.840 --> 59:47.680
needed to build and operate a deeply buried hundreds of mile long tunnel system and this is the order

59:47.680 --> 59:54.640
of 7800 to 8700 people and we also have a hard estimate for the total expenses associated with

59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.640
constructing operating and maintaining such a system the neighborhood of 17 billion dollars over

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:06.000
a 10-year period many such acknowledged tunnel systems exist like the department of energy

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.040
sprawling tunnel network below the nevada test and training range but let's continue to explore

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.960
the feasibility of massive tunnel systems connecting bases dozens or hundreds of miles apart the

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.320
technology for such undertakings does indeed exist the most likely candidates are nuclear

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.920
subterranes and tunnel boring machines tunnel boring machines are huge cylindrical mechanical

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.720
boring machines that tunnel through rock and soil chewing out circular tunnels that may range in

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.960
diameter of up to 35 or more feet these goliaths are powered by electrical motors that have a

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.000
cutting head equipped with various metal attachments made of super hard alloys that cut through rock

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.760
as the head rotates the head rotates and the cutting tools dig into the rock ripping and gouging it

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:55.120
away the excavated rock or muck is then passed by a conveyor assembly to the rear of the machine

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.080
where it can be hauled away by truck or train according to the pacific gas and electric company

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.800
utilizing a robin's company tbm to bore a 22 000 foot long 24 foot diameter tunnel it took a rate of

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:12.720
five to six miles per year however in better conditions some tbms could bore at a rate of 10

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.880
miles per year or greater roughly double the rate of the pacific gas and electric company this would

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.960
mean dumbs below china lake and edwards could be connected in as little as five and a half years

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.160
nuclear subterranes were originally designed by low salamos national lab sound familiar the

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.880
patents for such machines were filed technical documents were written but the project seemingly

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.400
faded into obscurity these fascinating machines work by melting through rock and soil leaving

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.160
neat solidly glass lined tunnels by vitrifying materials heat is supplied to the system via

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:51.440
compact nuclear reactors that circulate liquid lithium from the reactor core to the tunnel face

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.720
melting rock in front of the machine cooled liquid lithium then circulates to the back of the machine

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.920
alongside the exterior of the machine to cool surrounding rock as the machine is forced forward

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:09.360
patents were first proposed by the atomic energy commission in us energy rnd in 1972 and 1975

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:15.360
further nuclear subterranean patents in 1975 detailed tunnel systems of 12 meters or more in

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.640
diameter all but one of the inventors listed in the three patents above were from low salamos

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:27.280
additionally at 1973 low salamos study titled systems and cost analysis for a nuclear subterranean

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.840
tunnel machine a preliminary study concluded nuclear subterranes to be a cost efficient

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.360
solution to satisfy us transportation tunnel demands similar to how we deduce numerous

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.800
dumps were built around 1961 to 1989 we can make similar deductions regarding connective

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.760
tunnel systems if such an enormous tunnel system exists it likely saw construction

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:55.040
beginning around the early 1970s 1974 to be exact the bechtel corporation is an american

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.240
engineering procurement and construction management company founded in the u.s bechtel has often

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:06.640
been targeted as one of the u.s corporations responsible for dumb tunnel systems in 1974

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.840
bechtel released a report titled research program plan for meeting tomorrow's needs in tunneling

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.360
and excavation final report this report states quote the demand for tunneling and underground

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:23.120
excavation for national defense needs is believed to be large some examples of underground defense

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:29.280
facilities include hard rock silos command posts communication systems personnel shelters storage

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.160
and power generation facilities end quote interestingly enough the same report shows

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:41.040
a massive list of novel ground disintegration techniques in r&d stages in 1972 the governing

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.480
board of the national research council formed the u.s national committee on tunneling technology

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.200
this committee functioned as the quote united states focal agency in the field of tunneling

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.240
technology to assess and stimulate improvements in tunneling technology applications and to

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:03.040
coordinate us tunneling technology activities with those of other nations end quote by 1977 this

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:09.680
us n t t had six major subcommittees including the deep cavity and tunnel support systems committees

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:16.000
us n c t t partnered with numerous corporations agencies and academics of particular interest

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.840
to this channel these include both sandia national labs and bechtel memorial institute i've accused

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:28.640
bechtel of engaging deeply with uap legacy programs including operations at the dugway alleged dumb

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:36.000
in 1981 in 1982 the us n c t t sponsored a project called workshop on technology for the design and

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.600
construction of deep underground defense facilities this was done at the behest of the nuclear defense

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:48.480
agency and co-sponsors included the bureau of reclamation army usaf navy do e and national

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.760
science foundation including others the 1982 report of the workshop detailed the need for

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.640
400 miles of tunnels ranging from 2500 to 3500 feet for various purposes including housing nuclear

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.400
missiles these tunnels were to be up to 16 feet in diameter with quote interconnecting passageways

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.920
and add its horizontal passageways for storage living quarters and other needs end quote the

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.800
location of such a network of tunnels according to the new york times would be quote probably in

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.000
the desert of the western united states such tunnels and installations were to be powered

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.400
via fuel cells or nuclear reactors and as we saw in 1963 the us army corps of engineers was very

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.560
serious about nuclear reactors powering self-contained underground installations fuel cells may also be

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.000
of special interest here seen as in 1984 bowing published the results of a study that set forth

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.400
plans for power generation in deep icb m bases using iron chlorine fuel cells to generate power

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.800
the usn ctt called for mobilization of this plan in the late 80s and early 90s the committee called

01:05:52.800 --> 01:06:00.720
for tunnel boring machines to be utilized starting in 1985 for carving tunnel systems by 1988 usn ctt

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.840
was publishing reports titled tunneling and underground space technology discussing underground

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:12.960
missile systems ranging between 3000 to 8000 feet underground during this period in the 80s numerous

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.920
contractors i have directly accused of being involved in ufo legacy programs would aid in the

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.360
construction of deep underground missile bases and tunnel systems of course we must assume some if

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.200
not many underground nuclear missile bases may have served as clandestine rd tne facilities

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.600
this should not come as a shock as we have already discussed us intelligence agencies

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:39.680
utilizing underground military sites for secret operations such corporations include bdm who was

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:45.520
awarded in 1985 a contract to conduct quote intercontinental ballistic missile deep basing

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:52.160
communication study end quote as well as trw who had since 1968 been involved in studies into high

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.680
speed ground transportation tunnel design and cost analysis both corporations were later on

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:04.640
bought by northrop grumman the 1985 bdm study is of particular interest here remember if you will

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:11.760
earlier that same year 20 to 25 may 1985 to be exact bdm mclean also held the advanced

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:17.360
theoretical physics conference the meetings of this exclusive group were classified utilizing

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:23.120
doe controls notes of this conference were released by attendee oki shannon who formally

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:29.520
served as manager for special projects at low salamos national labs this mclean virginia secure

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.200
facility group discussed myriad aspects of ufo's including legacy programs and a major

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:41.200
engineering project under bobby ray inman viewers of my channel will absolutely recall inman

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.920
mentioned often as a senior ufo legacy operations member at this time the vice president of bdm

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.920
was former major general and founder of us army inscom albert stubblebine stubblebine will be

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:59.120
mentioned again in this project including how he was accused of engaging in ufo craft storage

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.200
and material exploitation while head of army intelligence at fort hachuka arizona interestingly

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.400
the advanced theoretical working group was spearheaded by us army colonel john b alexander

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:17.040
who from 1982 to 1983 reported directly to stubblebine additionally recall how philip j

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:22.800
corso claimed a ufo working group was established in the mid 80s according to corso this group

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.560
saw ample funding from us army inscom general stubblebine it is interesting to think of

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:34.480
possible ties between this icbm deep basing communication study and albert stubblebine

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.000
and the advanced theoretical physics conference and a possible ufo working group accused by philip

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.600
j corso throughout the 1980s us industry and government additionally demonstrated a keen

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.880
interest in life support systems for massive tunnel systems underground icbm installations

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.680
as well as deep and i mean deep underground bases this can be demonstrated in a november 1985

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.880
contract to uni tech technologies hamilton standard division for life support and chemical

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:09.520
biological agent mitigation system on small icbm deep basing programs end quote us army

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.920
corps of engineers as well as us nctt have even discussed provable technologies times and prices

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:23.200
to construct such massive tunnel systems yet no data exists on any large-scale tunneling project

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.240
this may force us to look deeper like at the low-profile records of the bureau of reclamation

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.360
who during the 20th century excavated hundreds of miles of tunnels up to 28 and a half feet in

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.720
diameter at depths of hundreds to thousands of feet quite often the bureau would utilize

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:44.080
classic tunnel boring machines numerous inside sources to dr richard solder have informed him

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.720
that some of the bureau of reclamation's tunnels have doubled as cover for other clandestine

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.400
underground tunnels to quote underground and underwater bases quote from a hypothetical

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.520
point of view what is to stop a tunnel boring machine from tunneling off of an aqueduct tunnel

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.880
deep underground and striking out secretly to make a clandestine tunnel it takes about 10 men

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.960
to operate a tbm and in good rock you can count on as much as 15 miles of tunnel per year end quote

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:21.120
for decades rumors of underground railroad systems specifically maglev trains have been

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.960
inseparable from testimony regarding dums and ufo's as we discussed earlier in the antelope

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.640
valley section such a concept was related to ufo researcher bill hamilton by some of his many

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.760
informants but just how true are these rumors of a high-speed electromagnetic railroad system

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:43.840
often described as a pneumatic system aka a train system operating in a partial vacuum tube

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.680
to begin what is maglev maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetic

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.200
rather than employing wheels maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad

01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:01.120
systems including higher speeds superior acceleration and deceleration lower maintenance costs

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.800
improved gradient handling and lower noise but are much more expensive compared to traditional

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:14.160
systems maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour and pneumatic tube trains are an

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.120
early form of transportation or air vacuum to move containers or vehicles through tubes while

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.320
minimizing friction new york's first subway system was an underground pneumatic tube transport

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.920
line created by alfred elie beach earlier in this project we spoke of nazi scientists being

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.760
sequestered by air material command in the us to work on underground complexes i would also

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.960
like to draw attention to herman kemper kemper was a third rike engineer who created a concept for

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.800
the roarbon the roarbon was a system of magnetic levitation trains designed to speed through

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:52.400
underground vacuum tunnels at hundreds or even thousands of miles per hour suspended passenger

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.840
cars on magnetic fields would be propelled through tunnels negating any friction of wheels rails and

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:04.800
air kemper's research began in 1934 by 1938 he envisioned berlin connected to other european

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:11.600
cities with cars traveling at 600 to 1000 miles per hour it is unknown how far the nazis pursued

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.960
this concept nor is it known if kemper was recruited by operation paperclip a feasible

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:23.280
hypothesis here is kemper was contracted by the us to help build early iterations of maglev pneumatic

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:30.000
systems maglev ufo's and dumbs are often lumped together as conspiracy however maglevs are not

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.800
a niche concept since the 1960s maglev technology has seen numerous patents and by the year 2000

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.920
even lockheed martin entered into agreements with trans rapid international usa to develop

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:49.120
maglev technology in the us in fact by the early 1990s an acknowledged multi agency national maglev

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:54.880
institute was formed this joint effort by the doe and us army corps of engineers sought to quote

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.320
define the role maglev could play in us transportation system to assess the potential for

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.840
maglev in the domestic market to recommend a strategy for the introduction of maglev technology

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:12.080
and to identify the most appropriate federal role end quote this nmi published a report in the early

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.680
nineties titled compendium of executive summaries from the maglev system concept definition final

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.360
reports this series of reports sought to determine nationwide maglev system availability by the year

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.800
2000 some interesting players appear in this document this includes a joint project with

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:35.200
bechtel hughes aircraft and mit which employs a uark for the army a second report saw work by

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:41.440
bowing aerospace and general dynamics to study superconducting levitation to top this off a third

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:47.040
study saw joint efforts into superconducting magnets performed by grumman corporation pre northrop

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.760
betel memorial labs and honeywell all contractors mentioned above in above board maglev technology

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:59.280
research i highly spect have for decades attempted the reverse engineering and material exploitation

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:06.320
of non-human craft however rumors of clandestine maglev systems far precede the 1990s and 2000s

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.480
dr richard solder as well as bill hamilton first heard whispers of such systems in the 1980s solder

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:18.160
himself referenced reading reports of underground rail systems to area 51 from mercury nevada and

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.760
the naval surface warfare center corona division discussion of these rail systems would even pop

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:31.360
up in online ufo forums around 1997 look at the name on the top of these testimony reports a j

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.960
kradoc in disgust in the dugway project kradoc is an oil tycoon operating in libya that helped

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.880
steven greer in the 1990s with c setty kradoc brought greer in my opinion incredibly valuable

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.680
and relevant information regarding area 51 moving many ufo operations to dugway so if maglev systems

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.120
existed far before ufo legacy program defense contractors engaged with the acknowledged national

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.480
maglev institute where and when might these systems have been developed and of what technology

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.520
the mid 1960s saw established engineering professors from the office of naval research

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:10.720
army research office and booze allen hamilton established the international society for terrain

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:17.680
vehicle systems or istv real quick in the mid to late 20th century i believe booze allen hamilton

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.040
was as involved in ufo legacy operations as northrop grumman is today but that's another project

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.040
for another day the istv s working group coordinated research around high speed underground tube

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.880
train systems at the same time of the istv s the u.s department of commerce established a

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:41.920
multi agency panel focused on high speed underground tube train systems the panel produced a 1967

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.760
report titled rnd for high speed ground transportation which states quote regardless of the system

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.480
adopted it can be assumed that extensive tunneling will be involved it is recommended that the

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.920
department cooperate closely with other agencies in planning and funding research into this area

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:04.000
to provide an extra stimulus for rapid development end quote of massive consequence to this investigation

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.400
in 1972 robert salter of the rand corporation published a study titled the very high speed

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.760
transit system in this study ran set out a continental deep underground concept that was

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:21.280
described as quote electromagnetically levitated and propelled cars in an evacuated tunnel end

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:27.120
quote the study makes some truly shocking statements including quote speeds as high as 14

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:32.400
thousand miles per hour have been examined and studies by the rand corporation in an example

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:37.840
case of a direct link between los angeles and new york requiring only 21 minutes of transit time

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.960
the speeds required will certainly be on the order of thousands of miles per hour on long

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.400
haul links end quote i believe salter additionally makes a critical statement that lends strongly

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:54.160
towards the subject of ufo legacy dumps salter states quote because of the rather considerable

01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:00.880
expanse of the tunnel it is probable that the first vhst will not rely on a direct nonstop la and

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.080
white link but rather one that stops at two intermediate staging points end quote these

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.640
intermediate staging points are apparent when throughout this video i have made and will continue

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.800
to make in the hamilton map segment the argument that ufo dump networks feature central hubs these

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.480
hubs if so to speak are connected to one another and branch to local smaller dump facilities think

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.600
of a railway central station connecting to other major stations while also featuring alternative

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.520
lines to small local stops much of this technology was based on work conducted by robert goddard

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:39.520
father of modern rocketry's 1945 vacuum tube transport system as well as michael minovich the

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:45.280
physicists behind introducing gravity assisted propulsion around planetary bodies 1961 work

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:51.120
deep underground tube shuttle salter and ran strongly recommended placing the vhst underground

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.440
to remove interference with environmental factors such as grade crossings weather and

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.560
infrastructure and also observed that it was not appreciable harder to tunnel at great lengths

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:07.200
underground than at shallow depths within this study is a map of the proposed vhst that corresponds

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:12.720
strongly to build hamilton's alleged western state dump network but more on this later around a

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:18.240
similar time frame to this ran study is the high speed ground transportation initiative this group

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:24.000
became operational in the 1960s performing most of their work in the 1970s before slipping out of

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.880
public view in the 1980s for a period of 10 to 15 years the united states saw enormous efforts into

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:37.120
rnd and feasibility and desirability of high speed underground tube shuttle train systems

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:43.760
entities involved in this program are countless including trw general dynamics mit southwest

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:50.000
research institute behind project stargate general electric nasa army navy and batel memorial

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.400
institute i have mentioned some of the work published under this initiative before including

01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:01.040
trw's 1967 study titled abstracts of concepts of high speed ground transportation systems

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.320
remember trw was purchased by northrop grumman and long considered as the contractor behind the

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.640
majestic 12 like entity project zodiac for the high speed ground transportation initiative trw

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.320
additionally prepared a study titled state of the art tube vehicle system in 1970 this study

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.440
discussed tube systems and tunnels as deep as 3000 feet underground using trains that would

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:30.560
travel at speeds of 450 miles per hour similar to the dumb tunnel concept no admission of maglevs

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.680
connecting stiffs is publicly available however there is an overwhelming body of historical

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.640
evidence the us and defense contractors have had a keen interest in high speed underground

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.800
transit systems traveling at least as fast as a commercial airliner

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:55.040
to close off our investigation i would like to return to 1992's cosmic top secret by bill

01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.640
hamilton in this masterpiece of a book hamilton provides a map of underground facilities and

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:08.720
tunnels provided to him by one tal in 1990 some data here is from thomas c aka thomas castillo

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.520
which is an extremely controversial source with the dulce new mexico story so instead

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:19.120
let's go ahead and analyze the map this network spans the american west and southwest with major

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:25.360
installations listed in southern california new mexico and colorado as expected earlier we find

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:31.440
edwards air force based connected to myriad locations including numerous small marks labeled rnd

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:37.760
we also see a supposed underground base marked cat this is of course catalina island fascinating

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:44.560
how in 2023 and 2024 discussion began to swirl of an underground extraterrestrial or human base

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.720
off of catalina island we also see area 51 as a major reference with connections to tonipa

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.880
an installation infamous in ufo lore as well we also find interesting solo mark dumps not connected

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:02.800
in this alleged system including fort hutchuka arizona a location i estimate is involved heavily

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:08.880
in ufo programs remember if you will fort hutchuka holds a defense agency major range and test

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:14.880
facility base a critical core facility called the joint interoperability center army intelligence

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.960
at fort hutchuka was previously run by us army inscom founder major general albert stubblebine

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.760
stubblebine and inscom have been accused by myself in numerous projects amongst others as

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:31.120
engaging in ufo crash retrieval storage and material exploitation therefore it is really

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:36.960
no surprise to see hamilton's map designate fort hutchuka as a dumb location on the map are many

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:43.280
locations in new mexico including the controversial dulci los alamos and sandia slash curtland

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:49.280
the latter two we know have underground facilities indeed the same extents to shayan in colorado

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.400
intriguing to note here is an installation in chihuahua mexico this subject wouldn't be touched

01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:01.280
jake barbers romana clay called sentinels of ether this project describes a 2004 blue on

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.960
blue ufo retrieval team fire operation in which the clandestine team flew into a disguised base

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.560
hidden in the mountains of chihuahua what happens when we start to compare this map to others

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:18.480
see now a comparison between hamilton's dumb network and rand's vhst see the interesting

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.760
direct route shared across the two maps through the northern area of arizona and new mexico

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.400
additionally observe how southern california sees routes split to both southern california

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.520
near san diego and northern california near sacramento before continuing north to portland

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:39.200
in washington also notice connections to denver on both locations outside of shayan mountain

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:45.760
complex denver colorado is home to an enormous underground fema complex this is likely a continuity

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.680
of government or c o g complex my true interest lies in comparing the hamilton piece to defense

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.720
laboratories and centers across the united states here we will not find groom lake amongst

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.520
other select facilities but i believe this comparison is of critical importance if you

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.360
will please forgive the maps not lining up the 1990 map is scaled differently than the 2019

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:13.520
do d map so the two are not merged to scale perfectly aligning the two maps brings extreme

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:18.880
interest to both dumb locations as well as markings on the hamilton piece that are labeled rnd

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:24.160
since this map pertains to connected underground ufo installations we can assume by the maps legend

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:30.560
these locations do not employ dumps but are still focused on ufo legacy rnd as expected southern

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.360
california brings a massive amount of locations of interest even outside of the antelope valley

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:42.560
to the southwest in los angeles lies a tremendous amount of do d rd t ne labs ffr dcs like rand

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:48.560
and aerospace corporations and uarks like the usc institute for creative technologies numerous

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.520
other locations outside of the antelope line up between the two maps we have discussed throughout

01:23:53.520 --> 01:24:00.080
this investigation including fort hachuka shyan mountain colorado dugway and its two mrtfb's

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:06.480
low salamos white sands missile range sandia and curtland air force base from referencing do d labs

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.920
we can also learn curtland and its proven underground facilities stand out even more curtland

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:17.120
additionally holds the air force research labs space vehicles directorate and directed energy

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.720
directorate of note shared on these maps albeit slightly shifted is the fourth defense estate

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:29.120
microelectronics activity in northern california in do d terms fourth estate describes non-military

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.720
parts of the do d these include the defense contract audit agency defense contract management

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.320
agency and the defense finance and accounting service fourth estate agencies and field activities

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:45.920
all watching this video might recognize our darpa and the defense missile agency prior to this

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.520
investigation i had never come across mention of a dumb below the d m e a so this is a terrific

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.800
point of research moving forward let's also reference more of the non-connected rnd locations

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:03.200
on hamilton's map that exist as acknowledged do d rd t ne facilities in nebraska on both maps

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.000
we find identification of the us stratcom university affiliated research center the

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.280
university of nebraska national strategic research institute viewers of my work know

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.200
uarcs and ffr dcs are cornerstones of uap legacy program so it is interesting to see

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:26.880
hamilton identify a uarc as a ufo rnd location all the way back in 1992 that would not be founded

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:34.320
until 2012 in oklahoma we observe fort sill as ufo rnd and the naval surface warfare center

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.840
indian head special weapons division mccallister detachment as ufo storage i have come across

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:46.160
both of these locations in my research however it is interesting to see an nswc location labeled as

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.920
storage especially after the testimony of randy anderson and the off-world technologies division

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.760
at the naval surface warfare centered crane in northern kansas we observe overlap of a ufo

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:04.240
research facility this facility is the us army leavenworth research unit in texas we find fort

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.760
hood army research unit as a ufo research location however it is interesting to see this facility

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:15.600
is not marked as a stiff especially after numerous testimony relayed by and research done by lennard

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.280
stringfield the hamilton map deserves an entire investigation of its own and possibly i will do

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:27.840
so with dr sotter because after all this map does accuse dumbs of existing at all locations we

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:33.520
have previously discussed as well as many that warrant further investigation including fort

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.640
stockton fort urwin vandenberg a fb chocolate mountains aerial gunnery range 29 palms hutchinson

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.160
air force station and peterson air force base as well as the cities of kingsley nebraska

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:52.640
tulsa oklahoma and riverton wyoming i have spoken to dr sotter and he has spoken directly with bill

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:59.040
hamilton regarding this map so just maybe he can aid in further dissecting of these locations

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.920
hey guys it's gerb and if you're still with me thank you so much for joining me in this

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:10.880
at this point hour 20 hour and a half investigation into dumbs as many of you know and as many people

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.840
have been looking forward to this project dumbs are a passion project of mine i speak about

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.960
installations under dugway under the antelope valley under the north of tejon and hellendale

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.920
facilities in numerous videos uh i think probably my last four videos straight i've mentioned one

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:33.680
if not multiple of these locations as we made it to the end of this video i'd like to thank again

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.720
dr richard sotter for all of his excellent research now this video is going to be doing things a little

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.040
bit differently of course in every single one of my videos i include my show notes in the video

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:49.440
description or a link please bear with me a couple days here as i have not only compiled my research

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:55.680
links for this video but also every single document that i can find that dr richard sotter

01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:01.200
has included in his three books so every single defense technical document every single army

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.760
corps of engineer document every single document i could find which there's hundreds so please allow

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:12.000
me a couple days to compile all that and deliver that because i think it's excellent to read through

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.920
all of those and please read through dr richard sotter's books they're they're excellent as we

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.560
know from today the subject of dumbs is very vast it's almost impossible to know where and when to

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:28.480
start there is a tremendous amount of literature on deep underground facilities for continuity of

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:34.720
government use for icbm silos for just general underground installations accessible by vertical

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:40.400
or inclined shaft there's also a tremendous amount of information specifically starting post 1974

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:49.200
with bechtel on large-scale tunneling systems and conventional and unconventional the blasting

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.280
methods this would be a tunnel boring machine or a nuclear subterranean as a conventional method

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.880
or explosives or possibly nuclear detonation as unconventional and also a lot of literature on

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:05.600
maglev technology i know these three subjects of interconnected dumb bases are often scoffed at without

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:14.480
a lot of research but this is a very serious subject and at least i would say focused in the

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.840
southwest and the american desert and the east there are probably large networks of

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.280
dumps this would include new mexico arizona southern california possibly up to connecting

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:31.040
to dugway and colorado and then a network out east including the warrenton army training facility

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:39.600
camp piery camp david uh the du cc which i wager highly exists and so forth now of course

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.160
let's treat this video as a part one a part two will be a project with dr richard solder

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.120
i spoke to him the other week for about two to three hours and he graciously agreed to come on

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.160
the show and talk more about dumps i think what's really interesting here is there are numerous

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.440
informants just like bill hamilton had that have told him about installations and facilities and

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:07.600
perhaps he can tell those on our project together and relay them because he said some to me in our

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:13.120
conversations that he hasn't repeated publicly that are indeed quite interesting also when bill

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:20.080
hamilton was still alive dr richard solder talked to him and length about his network of dumps maps

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:26.960
so possibly for an hour hour and a half we will dive into that so please look forward to a dr

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.920
richard solder project coming in the future and please also look forward to the show notes you

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.280
know uh another thing i'm doing is i'm planning to build a website no sign up needed it's not the

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.800
dpi archive but i'm planning to uh put up a website where i have videos transcripts of the

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.200
videos and all research links so i'd like to put those there the only reason i plan to do this is

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.640
to make it easier to access all the materials i put forth with my research but i want to know

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:57.600
what everybody thinks about dumps specifically networks of dumps dumps are not a controversial

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.160
things dumps do indeed exist and from numerous testimony whether that be lennard stringfield

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:08.400
whether that be testimony to solder to hamilton to myself there is a incredible argument that many

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:14.080
of these facilities dump facilities engage in uap legacy programs i like to think back to the

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:20.720
testimony of ms for example which led to a tremendously fruitful venture into the dump under

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.520
dugway and of course we even have a specific entrance to that facility other research from other

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.600
informants can be done on this another thing i did differently in this project of course is i

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.200
hardly interject when witnesses have spoken to me about testimony or given me testimony i thought

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:41.040
it prudent in this investigation just when speaking about various stump facilities and to summarize

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:46.240
these include i've spoken to individuals who have been in networks under the antelope valley

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:52.960
in location under texas that connected via underground train that went so fast it reminded

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:59.520
this army veteran of his fear of flying to white sands missile range as well as the what we might

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:05.120
call the deep underground command center out east this is a location deep under the pentagon how

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:11.200
deep i don't know however i have good insight this is a facility or at least there are facilities

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:17.040
here that are run by the cia directorate of science and technology if that sounds familiar to you

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:22.080
that was the cia office that blocked the material transfer in 2008 from lockheed martin to

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:29.440
the osap program and that was the 1953 kingman crash but the networks of dumps are what are

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:35.280
so interesting to me for example harkening back to the story of ed and the nevada test and training

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.960
range and edwards air force base there's other testimony about connections in bases in southern

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:48.320
california to to area 51 tone upon the nevada test and training range if i could ever get ed

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:52.080
to sit down in a room and believe me i've tried to speak to him the first thing i would ask him

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.640
if there's connective tunneling systems and what type of vehicles if there are that connect these

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:01.920
two places now absent in this video of course i talked about in the beginning are the stories of

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:08.160
bob lasar the stories of dulcy base and thomas castillo and the story of phil schneider i believe

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:14.960
that these in that these witnesses these subjects are very controversial so i didn't include them

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:21.040
because of their controversy but because when i have such controversial claims i think it prudent

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:27.040
to investigate those and vet those and try to determine any sort of objective information

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:33.520
from those when we can so you know s4 for example i do believe s4 is a facility that does indeed exist

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.000
does it have extraterrestrial or non-human technology i don't know uh an individual i've

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.400
spoken to that went to s4 talked about colored lines where to walk but he didn't see anything

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:51.040
that would say non-human technology but then again he was not privy to the entire base but

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:58.800
because of that i would like to focus on subjects like s4 maybe dulcy base um and maybe other locations

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:04.160
as well and i will do those in a separate project with this project i wanted to take as objective

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.440
of an approach as i could i wanted to combine the facts we know about dums about tunnel systems

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:16.480
about maglev systems and relay those two stories of the ansolope valley stories of locations out east

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.240
i mean there is a tremendous amount of facilities i didn't get to cover here that i would like to

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:27.040
revisit so again as i spoke about in the project with dr richard solder this is just kind of a taste

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.640
into dums i do think this is one of the most consequential subjects of of ufo legacy programs

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.240
you know like i said and i'll say it again most underground facilities as we see from the u.s army

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:47.040
corps of engineers and other documents were first proposed as a continuity of government a cog or a

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.440
icbm silo facility and we know that is partially true in the large fema underground center near

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.760
denver colorado which everybody knows i'm from colorado so that's near where i am so

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:03.200
the clandestine operation when did these start as we talked about the dums there's a good argument

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.640
that in post 1961 when the u.s army corps of engineers really started to look into underground

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:15.520
facilities uh massive ones ranging up to up to in some documents 8 000 feet underground into the

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.320
late 90s i think this is when the vast majority of underground installations were built when were

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:26.320
the connective tunnels built if these do exist which i believe many locations do feature connective

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.720
tunnels this of course as we saw in the bechtel report with conventional and unconventional

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:38.240
tunneling methods probably started around 1974 between 1972 and 1974 a whole host of tunneling

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:44.880
committees and institutes were set up to investigate massive tunneling systems and of course

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.640
following in the 80s into the 90s we see the same thing with maglev technologies so i i think the

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:56.480
order of operations here is likely the dumbest built maybe a decade later connective tunnels are

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.520
built and maybe a decade after that the full train systems are implemented i mean in the 90s we see

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:07.520
the national maglev institute and we see corporations like grumman like general dynamics like betel

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:14.560
doing aboveboard maglev research so this could likely imply they had been doing clandestine

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:21.600
research into similar projects into electromagnetics long before then so it's a it's an incredibly

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.480
fascinating subject especially when you start to look at the bureau of reclamation and what dr

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.840
solder has relayed from his informants about the bureau of reclamation this was possibly an

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.120
aboveboard tunneling system in the american southwest that featured clandestine secondary

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.920
tunnels to bore out whatever was needed and as we saw in the list i scrolled through there are

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:50.160
hundreds of tunnels from the bor that in the mid to late 20th century and some of these are

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.440
hundreds of miles long some of these are thousands and they range in depths from

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.120
just underground to up to near a thousand feet so when dr solders informant relates to him that

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:04.160
10 men can operate a tbm and a good tbm in good conditions can chew through up to 10 miles per

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.800
year i do think this is a likely candidate you know this harkens back to other ufo legacy program

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:15.520
funding operations how we what we get can make educated guesses via irad sole source contracts

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:23.760
id iq and utilizing legitimate contracts to skim off funds for ufo legacy programs now

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.240
again i want to know what everybody thinks if there are people here who have been to underground

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.880
facilities massive deep underground facilities please reach out to me i would love to hear

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:41.600
about your experience i will respect your anonymity but if you have a location a facility to describe

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.840
or an experience in such a facility please reach out to me i would love to talk to you but

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.960
again guys let me know in the comments what you think this has been a long spiel almost 11 minutes

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.200
i think i've rambled quite a bit please remember to like and subscribe on the video and remember

01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.880
guys i do have a patreon i don't gate keep my content in my opinion this might be stubborn or

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:05.760
this might be a bit narcissistic i think the content is important to view so i'm not going to gate

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.240
keep anything because i would like all of my research all of my projects and all my research

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.600
materials to be publicly available to anybody so the patreon is there to support what you think

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:22.080
the channel is worth not to lock off any content so with that guys i have a couple projects coming

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.480
up i'm really really really darn excited about i'm trying to think about how i'm going to juggle

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.200
these but about three projects on the immediate mind i'm already working on including and that

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:36.160
includes the project with dr richard solder so i will catch everybody soon and thank you so very

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.800
much for joining me bye now
