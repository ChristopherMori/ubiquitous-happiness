0	4400	On June 5th, 2023, the now legendary debrief article titled,
4400	9040	Intelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin
9040	12880	by Leslie Keen and Ralph Blumenthal took the world by storm.
12880	16880	This article introduced the world to David Grush and solidified the fact
16880	20640	the USG is in possession of craft of non-human origin
20640	25760	and actively attempts crash retrieval and reverse engineering of these anomalous vehicles.
25840	31120	Within this article, one Carl Nell has mentioned, a now retired Army Colonel who worked with
31120	36560	Grush on the UAP Task Force. While Nell has one quote in this article supporting the assertions
36560	42800	of David Grush, he states an astounding fact, quote, his assertion concerning the existence
42800	48240	of a terrestrial arms race occurring subrosa over the past 80 years focused on reverse
48240	54640	engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable
54640	60880	realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence.
61760	66800	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and today I wanted to do a quick video talking about Carl Nell
66800	73280	and his crucial role in UAP disclosure. The importance of Nell's data and position on UAP
73280	78960	as detailed in his recent Soul Foundation symposium talk simply cannot be understated.
79120	85600	Guys, you know me, this is not just a reaction video of Nell's 31 minute talk at the Soul
85600	89680	Foundation. I've already picked out all the important parts I want to discuss, made the
89680	94320	proper connections, and so let's go through it. I'm not here to waste your time. Let's start.
94880	99680	Before we break down Colonel Nell's speech on the Soul Foundation on the Schumer Amendment and
99680	105200	the push for controlled disclosure, let's quickly cover what exactly the Soul Foundation is.
105840	109920	The Soul Foundation is a group of scientists and academia folk,
109920	115040	military personnel, and government or policy makers that seek to educate the public on
115040	120720	academic legitimacy of UAP and push for a post-disclosure world. The Soul Foundation
120720	125760	includes figures whose credibility is beyond reproach, such as former depsec Christopher
125760	132400	Mellon, whistleblower David Grush, Stanford pathology professor Gary Nolan, PhD physicist
132400	139360	Kevin Knuth, Colonel Nell, and more. Nell spoke to the symposium in November 2023 at the Nolan
139360	144480	Laboratory of the Stanford School of Medicine, so let's break down and cover his key points.
144480	148480	If you have your finger on the pulse, you'll remember this speech happening and some apparent
148480	154080	leaked slides from his presentation, but it's not till February 2024 we've actually got to
154080	159600	see the whole presentation. Nell begins by breaking down the groundbreaking Schumer Amendment.
159680	164960	Well, 10 years ago, probably the Schumer Amendment would have been viewed as a UAP UFO disclosure.
165520	169920	I've talked about this piece of legislation at length in almost every single one of my videos,
169920	176640	but thankfully Nell provides a comprehensive summary of this legislation. He goes on to discuss
176640	181680	background to the UAP Disclosure Act, citing the importance of Leslie Keane's article that
181680	188480	appeared on the 16th of December, 2017, bringing FLIR, Gimbal, and GoFast to the public domains as a
188480	194480	major paradigm shift. Nell thanks Chris Mellon and Lou Elizondo for their tireless work to get
194480	200240	these videos released and move the ball forward on UAP. So certainly that was a key incident.
200240	208720	The next piece was, I would argue, the David Grush, Ryan Graves, David Fraver testimony
208720	215360	before Congress, again lowering the threshold of making this topic respectable and incentivizing
215360	220560	some discussion about it. Two of the legislators that sponsored this bill are in the Gang of Eight.
220560	224800	The Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the two parties from the Senate and House of
224800	229200	Representatives, and the chairs of the ranking minority members of both the Senate Committee
229200	234720	and the House Committee for Intelligence as set forth by the 50 USC purpose. Certain members
234720	240560	of Congress are legally entitled to hear about all information pertaining to SAPs and secret programs.
241360	245040	Nell goes on to state the importance of the two members here, who are privy to
245040	251360	all read and access, yet have not been informed on UAP. Colonel Nell then goes on to talk about
251360	256000	the scope of the legislation and how changing reference terminology can start to strip away
256000	266000	the stigma. You know, shift UFO to UAP, USO to USP, flying saucer to UAP, and ETs to NHI.
266880	272240	I think this is a beautiful reference by the Colonel, as terms like UFO, flying saucer,
272240	278240	extraterrestrials even, are deeply ingrained in this stigma and are often scoffed at when mentioned,
278800	284960	but UAP, NHI are now termed an official legislation and must be taken seriously.
284960	291680	Take a look here at the now six characteristics of UAP referenced. I often reference the five as
291680	298560	listed by Lou Elizondo, but note item six, physical or invasive biological effects.
299200	302640	This is a fascinating addition likely brought to the table by Gary Nolan,
302640	308720	who is studying this aspect of the phenomenon. Think about the fear Wagan felt when he saw
308720	316720	the UFO craft, or something like Havana syndrome. The Schumer Amendment focuses specifically on UAP,
317360	324160	not TNO, as this graphic beautifully highlights unknown unknowns.
324160	328640	Let me read here what the actual legislation says, so we know specifically what they
328640	336160	intended with Schumer. UAP is any object operating or judge capable of operating in outer space,
336160	341200	the atmosphere, ocean surface, or undersea, lacking prosaic attribution,
341200	348560	due to performance characteristics and properties not previously known to be achievable
348560	354320	based upon commonly understood principles of physics. There's a massive difference between UAP
354320	359920	and TNO. And there's a huge distinction between these, and Schumer makes this explicit.
360800	368080	So TNO is a class of objects that temporarily resist prosaic attribution by the initial observer
368080	373440	due to performance or due to environmental or system limitations associated with the
373440	379840	observation process, but that nevertheless have a known accepted human origin.
380560	385120	So TNO is the stuff that you mistake at the time of observation, but you later figure out
385120	389840	like what it is. So if you look at Blue Book, you know, depending on the statistics you want to use,
389840	396720	the 94% or the 80% of what they spent their time on was TNO, was all explainable. The residuals.
397200	402640	To continue touching on the legislation here, NEL references a slide on the NDAA's Executive
402640	408640	Summary. The key takeaway here is utilizing the National Archives to archive all UAP data.
409520	414240	NEL states what we are all thinking. Nobody necessarily trusts that's going to happen,
414240	420320	and I think. Therefore, the review board will provide oversight. Unlike the 1992 JFK Records
420320	427280	oversight, here NEL references the issue of materials, biological evidence of NHI and technology
427280	433120	of unknown origins. Thus, the Schumer Amendment allows for eminent domain of these materials.
433680	440960	Colonel NEL explains the terms NHI, legacy programs, prosaic attribution, and TuO that appear
440960	447200	specifically in the Schumer Amendment. He makes it apparent that the NDAA was searching specifically
447280	451920	for anything that is non-human related. These are terms of reference in the legislation. So
451920	457440	non-human intelligence, at least 18 times cited in there, any sentient intelligent non-human life
457440	463440	form, regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for UAP based on
463440	469600	the earlier definition, or of which the federal government has become aware. Legacy program,
469600	473680	all federal, state, local government, commercial industry, academic, private sector endeavors to
473680	479440	collect, exploit, versus engineer, TuO, or biological evidence of NHI. Prosaic attribution,
479440	485040	you remember this was in both of those terms, UAP and TNO. Prosaic attribution, having a human,
485040	493520	either foreign or domestic origin. So UAP is non-human, TNO human. Technology of unknown origin,
493520	498640	this is very important for the eminent domain clause. Any material or metamaterial, ejecta,
498640	503520	crash debris, mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies, or sub-assemblies, engineering models
503520	509200	or processes, damage or intact aerospace vehicles, or damage or intact ocean surface or undersea
509200	517520	crap associated with UAP, or incorporating science and technology lacking prosaic attribution or known
517520	522480	means of human manufacture. The kernel then goes on to highlight arguments for and against
522480	528080	eminent domain of all UAP record and materials. And for those of you who don't know, eminent domain
528080	532880	is essentially the federal government's ability to take whatever they want, whenever they want.
533680	538000	What is interesting here is that some of the cons infringe on property ownership.
538560	544400	Here Nell is specifically referring to private corporations in possession of UAP and UAP material.
545520	549280	Nell moves on to make the key distinction between control disclosure
549280	555920	and catastrophic disclosure. This difference being control disclosure uses a campaigned plan,
555920	561200	and catastrophic disclosure is essentially the opening of the floodgates. All information
561200	568160	dumped out there by possibly an adversary or NHI themselves to create social disruption or other
568160	574800	means. Unfortunately the Schumer Rounds amendment was watered down and gutted by adversaries to
574800	580080	pro-disclosure. Hopefully this bill in its entirety will be released in the near future,
580080	588960	maybe the 2025 NDAA. Here Nell states reasons for and against non-disclosure. This is an extremely
588960	595040	intriguing slide and logically all six reasons make sense. National security implications,
595040	600720	lack of a credible plan, social disruption, covert agreements cover for misdeeds,
600720	605120	and organizational intrusion slash distraction from priorities.
605840	612240	We know from Grush an almost cold war has been conducted to keep knowledge of UAP from adversaries,
612240	617360	specifically China and Russia, addressing the national security risks posted here.
618080	623680	I am really interested in the new physics slash technologies that have unprecedented
623680	629840	ramifications for all human society. And look at the covert agreement section,
629840	638960	NHI quid pro quo. Is it possible and true that the USG has made deals or agreements with NHI,
638960	643600	as some people have suggested? And the cover for misdeeds, this is also addressed by Grush.
644160	648000	Part of the reason for the cover up is in fact feudalistic dominance,
648000	652160	and numerous crimes including murder have been conducted to keep these secrets.
652800	656960	But now take a look at the cons or essentially pro-disclosure agreements.
657760	663840	Under prevent loss of technological dominance here, look at, some evidence suggests the USA
663840	670880	may be losing a UAP arms race. If this is true and Russia or China are near breakthroughs of
670880	678720	harnessing NHI, this has global power shift levels of implications. As Nell states, all of these
678720	684640	issues are better solved in an academic sector and are largely not government issues besides
684640	690560	the cold war and arms race. And now we arrive to Nell's famous slide which partially leaked back
690560	698880	in November 2023 titled, Way Forward UAP Campaign Plan Lines of Effort. This slide is
698880	704640	absurdly perplexing so let's break it down. To reach a post-disclosure world with proper
704640	710560	oversight restored, catastrophic disclosure avoided, and scientific understanding advanced?
711360	717840	Nell envisions a campaign with five major phases through four major channels, the public sector,
717840	721840	philosophical investigation, scientific research, and the private sector.
722800	729040	Phase zero consists of shaping the narrative around UAP which was done successfully by ATIP,
729040	736080	DOD videos, the 2017 New York Times article, and UAP Task Force. Notice guys how Arrow is not listed
736080	741600	here, I'm sure Sean Kirkpatrick is seething. Phase one, which has a targeted end date of
741600	748480	January 1st 2024 seems all but complete, ending with the Schumer legislation. Government acceptance
748480	756160	has been achieved, UAP is now largely a bipartisan issue, and reactive hypothesis generation is popping
756160	762160	up such as the newly published paper claiming that some UAP are plasma-based pre-life.
763040	770160	Phase two aims to correlate signatures by January 1st 2026, garnering a more stringent approach
770160	773360	and harnessing of academia like the Soul Foundation is doing.
774080	779520	Likely due to the stigma persisting around serious academic research, this phase is still at risk.
780480	787040	Phase three plans to be completed by October 1st 2030 and is seen as an inflection point by Nell,
787040	792800	possibly serving as the disclosure point for humanity. This phase seeks public acceptance,
792800	799680	which is a tall ask if you ask me. Phase four to be completed by the 1st of October 2034
799680	807040	aims to fully answer the five W's, who, what, when, where, and why. This phase is off-target,
807040	812560	and finally phase five has an indefinite timeline, looking for an interactive approach with UAP in
812560	820960	a strategic end state, possibly meaning integrating NHI and NHI technology with our earth and civilization.
821920	826320	Nell has a couple ideas for each of the four channels and how they can lead to a post-disclosure
826320	831040	world. So this is the government line of effort. Pass Schumer, grant legal amnesty,
831040	836000	centralized the data, create a Manhattan project to address this area, sponsor National Science
836000	841440	Foundation grants, charter an NIE, National Intel Estimate to assess the public-private
841440	846480	positions of every country with this topic and where they are with it, and use that to tee up
846480	854160	a United Nations summit or World Congress on developing new norms of behavior in this context.
854160	859120	I think we need a sociological model for analyzing the societal impact for disclosure
859120	864240	and then developing mitigation strategies a priori to address that. Now, some people think
864240	868480	that maybe less of a concern or more of a concern is kind of irrelevant, like it's an unknown right
868480	875120	now, but we need a plan to address it to lower that concern. Codify the laws of ethics in an
875120	879680	environment where we might have a hierarchy of being, where everyone isn't necessarily
879680	883920	having equal competitive potential. How do you, it's essentially translating
883920	888800	our special relativity version of ethics to a general relativity version of ethics,
888800	895200	where you've got the problem of a more advanced civilization coming in and disrupting a less
895200	900480	advanced civilization, developing theoretical as well as practical methods to analyze metamaterials.
900480	906080	And let's get to the point where we can actually talk about utilizing the, what is it, 339 isotopes
906080	911360	and engineering materials out of that instead of the 118 elements that were been sort of limited
911360	916000	to. We need to work in the business utility of forming consortiums to actually look at this
916000	920400	material if the government was actually going to make it available. Codify presence and legal
920400	927120	standards for determining intellectual property rights over the material, analyzing economic
927120	932000	incentives and the impact to the economy if new energy sources were developed.
932640	939040	Nell's presentation is poignant and powerful with astounding implications, but we can go a
939040	945840	little deeper here. Now let's visit two backup slides not shown on Nell's presentation as provided
945840	952640	by Matthew Pines. The first of these slides looks to replace the Kardashev Scale. I talked about
952640	957920	this in part two of my iceberg, but essentially the Kardashev Scale benchmarks the technological
957920	964160	capabilities of a civilization and places them into three types. A planetary civilization that
964160	969760	is able to harness all the energy from their home planet, a stellar civilization which is able to
969760	976080	harness all of the energy from its host star, and a galactic civilization which is able to
976080	983280	harness the complete energy output of its home galaxy. We are currently in estimated 0.72 on
983280	991200	the Kardashev Scale. Look at this line. Since it is not implausible, given the diversity of UAP
991200	997920	sightings, that numerous civilizations may be interacting concurrently. That is just such
997920	1004720	an intriguing thought, but this new scale looks to develop a universal civilization development
1004720	1012320	datum to try and forecast NHI motives based on attributes. Instead of just a sliding scale,
1012320	1018400	this is a new multivariable system in which what they are, what they know, and who they are,
1018400	1024000	are gauged and plotted. The end states for these civilizations are quite astounding.
1024640	1031600	Spacetime manipulation, understanding reality, and immortality slash physical transcendence
1031600	1038160	are the three kind of variable reference points of these civilizations. I am honestly
1038160	1044320	blown away by this slide, the proposed taxonomy of UAP and origin hypothesis,
1044320	1050320	and struggle to know where to even start. UAP, hypothesis, and NHI are broken up here into
1050320	1058000	three main categories, physical, psychophysical, and metaphysical. Within the physical are origins
1058000	1066000	that span from expected to downright bizarre. We have, of course, our natural phenomena, humans,
1066000	1072080	inner galactic, ETs, and even proto-humans, but then we also have stranded gods,
1072960	1078640	unknown regions of spacetime, disconnected hyperspace, the 3D avatars, or holograms,
1078640	1084400	as Grush once mentioned with the holographic universe. Within physical we even get weirder,
1084400	1089040	with colliding universes, parallel universes, macro quantum fluctuations,
1089120	1094800	pan-galactic entanglement, and distance recursion. And now we get the medical physical,
1094800	1102320	in which supernatural forces, incorporeal life forms, ascended masters, angelic or demonic
1102320	1108400	beings, artificial realities, and more are mentioned. This is wild stuff, and actually,
1108400	1113120	thinking of some fun, please let me know if you would like me to do a tier list on these proposed
1113120	1117120	taxonomies. Just my personal opinion on all these topics, but of course that could be an
1117120	1124000	absolute blast because I'll tell you right now, I identify more with the physical range of explanations
1124000	1127840	and not just the, you know, pretty standard stuff, but I'd like to get into that.
1128880	1135120	Things with Nell couldn't get any weirder, right? But what if I told you he was one of the 40 first
1135120	1140000	hand witness whistleblowers that Grush interviewed? Check out this Leslie Cain clip.
1148000	1158240	David Grush said in his testimony that he talked to 40 people over four years,
1158240	1163840	all of whom had information on a secret military program that has non-human craft and remains.
1163840	1167760	Is it surprising to you that none of those 40 people has spoken out?
1169760	1175120	It is, it actually isn't Elizabeth. I mean, as some of them have, one of them actually
1175120	1181680	was in our article in the debrief, a former Army colonel named Carl Nell. I think maybe some of
1181680	1186400	them have spoken out a little bit and we just don't maybe put it all together, but it really
1186400	1191760	isn't surprising because of the repercussions that people face. And Dave Grush is an example of that.
1191760	1196160	He talked a little bit of in the hearing yesterday about the repercussions that he's faced, which
1196160	1202640	are very harmful to him, both personally and professionally for speaking out. So I think others
1202640	1206880	have the same concerns and they've seen it happen to him. They want to wait and make sure it's safe
1206880	1211520	for them to come forward and not have to face the same kinds of things that David Grush faced.
1211520	1214560	Yeah, can you elaborate on that? And he just said he had some.
1214560	1219680	I'd like to thank Twitter Ace UAP News at highpeak77 for making a thread on this.
1220240	1225120	In Colonel Nells LinkedIn bio, he served as the technical intelligence operations officer for the
1225120	1231200	DIA. Here states, quote, first person deployed from the DIA directorate of intelligence production
1231280	1237360	and analysis to participate in multi-agency planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom as the
1237360	1244640	foreign materials program command representative to U.S. CENTCOM slash CFLCC in Kuwait.
1245440	1251520	Served as the C slash J2 for the one star combined joint captured material exploitation
1251520	1256880	center in Iraq. And as we know from Schellenberger's article, dozens of government whistleblowers
1256960	1262720	have given testimony to Congress Pentagon and Inspector General says sources that there have
1262720	1270000	been ongoing crash retrieval programs of both foreign vehicles and UAP. Could Nells role in
1270000	1277120	this Iraq mission? Seeing him encounter a downed UAP leading to his first hand witness testimony,
1277120	1282480	I got a lot more to dive into here. So stay tuned. But thank you again, UAP News for that Twitter
1282480	1289600	thread. Hey guys, I know this video turned out almost as long as Colonel Nells talk itself.
1290160	1294800	But still, I thought it important to try and break down everything that he said in this
1294800	1298800	soul symposium. I hope you guys enjoyed this breakdown. There's a lot of other interesting
1298800	1304640	talks from this soul foundation event I want to go through, including grushes, Chris Melons,
1304640	1310480	Kevin Knuths, Gary Nolan, Jacques Valais as well. So if you guys like this, stay tuned for that.
1310480	1317600	I had a lot of fun making this. I hope you don't mind the not kind of reaction style. I wanted to
1317600	1321520	watch this and make sure I had all my thoughts first before I reported information to everybody,
1321520	1327600	not do kind of a not much effort, watch through together. So I hope you enjoyed it just a quick
1327600	1334080	video today. Please remember to like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next video. Thank you.
