WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security

00:05.400 --> 00:10.320
Agency in the United States, deputy director at CIA, director of Naval Intelligence and

00:10.320 --> 00:16.480
a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really

00:16.480 --> 00:22.520
accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man

00:22.520 --> 00:23.880
who had to know.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.800
So I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the

00:28.800 --> 00:37.200
U.K. and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered

00:37.200 --> 00:40.720
under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have

00:40.720 --> 00:43.640
possession of the hardware associated with this.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.840
In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon as to...

00:45.840 --> 00:47.360
A craft, a spaceship.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.720
Several of them, and they were in operational condition.

00:58.800 --> 01:27.760
The paper incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile and a half of water

01:27.760 --> 01:29.760
north Atlantic.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.240
What had happened, they had picked up a...

01:32.240 --> 01:37.200
There's a survey vehicle working in the north Atlantic that had picked up some radioactive

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
signal.

01:38.200 --> 01:44.720
It was almost a perfect symmetric piece of metal with marking around the edge and it

01:44.720 --> 01:50.600
was just a triangular shape, but no glass, nothing that would appear to be a hatch or

01:50.600 --> 01:54.840
a cockpit of any type.

01:54.840 --> 02:01.040
From Roswell in 1947 to Jake Barber in 2024, on this channel we have discussed extensively

02:01.040 --> 02:07.120
UFO crash retrieval operations performed by UFO legacy programs involving the United States

02:07.120 --> 02:09.080
Army and Air Force.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.200
Over the past decades, these retrievals are alleged to have occurred over the continental

02:13.200 --> 02:19.240
United States, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, the former Soviet Union, China, and numerous lands

02:19.240 --> 02:20.560
around the globe.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.400
In several U.S. incidents, rapid reaction response teams are detailed to fly in via

02:25.400 --> 02:31.160
helicopter, drive in via flatbed truck, or utilize any vehicle system to retrieve non-human

02:31.160 --> 02:37.000
craft and transport them to clandestine above and below ground military installations.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.120
But what about retrieval operations that must be conducted in the oceans of our planet?

02:42.120 --> 02:47.760
What happens when UFOs crash into water or USOs, unidentified submerged objects must

02:47.760 --> 02:49.040
be recovered?

02:49.040 --> 02:53.640
How are such operations conducted in the most mysterious corners of our planet where only

02:53.640 --> 02:58.080
roughly 26% of our oceans floors have been mapped?

02:58.080 --> 03:03.160
This would of course require the most powerful seafaring military on the planet, the United

03:03.160 --> 03:08.920
States Navy, and it's a measurable special access programs, internal intelligence offices,

03:08.920 --> 03:13.880
corporate programs, and partnerships with shadowy U.S. intelligence apparatuses.

03:13.880 --> 03:19.200
What does the Navy just retrieve UFO and USOs in our water, or do they, like many retrieval

03:19.200 --> 03:23.720
instances we have covered on this channel involving the Army and Air Force, additionally

03:23.720 --> 03:29.960
engage in storage, exploitation, and reverse engineering of technologies of unknown origin?

03:29.960 --> 03:35.480
For this reason, I want to dive in and explore the modus operandi, operational history, and

03:35.480 --> 03:39.960
key players in U.S. UFO Navy legacy programs.

03:39.960 --> 03:45.360
On the research we will explore in this project, I theorize naval UFO programs can be delegated

03:45.360 --> 03:51.560
to four major components of operation, monitor, collect, store, and exploit.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.720
These operations are likely conducted out of the Office of Naval Research and Office

03:55.720 --> 04:01.920
of Naval Intelligence in conjunction with U.S. Special Forces Command, SOCOM, shadowy intelligence

04:01.920 --> 04:06.680
organizations like the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office and Navy

04:06.680 --> 04:13.960
Special Program, and involve U.S. naval stations like NAWC China Lake and NSWC Crane, while

04:13.960 --> 04:19.680
engaging with defense contractors and FFRDCs such as Lockheed Martin for utilization of

04:19.680 --> 04:24.320
their now-retired deep-submergence rescue vehicles Mystic and Avalon.

04:24.320 --> 04:29.520
This investigation will explore in tremendous detail the three components of naval UFO programs

04:29.520 --> 04:35.800
I outlined above, UFO and USO collection, NHI craft storage, and technologies of unknown

04:35.800 --> 04:38.800
origin, TUO, exploitation.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.580
One major cornerstone I theorize exists in naval UFO programs, monitor, will be largely

04:44.580 --> 04:46.800
emitted from today's exploration.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.920
While the topic of possible undersea UFO bases or installations is well worth investigating

04:51.920 --> 04:56.920
in the future, I have covered the topic of USO reports twice already on this channel.

04:56.920 --> 05:03.320
These include discussion of OPNAF 3820, a naval regulation restricting maritime UFO reporting.

05:03.320 --> 05:09.000
With that being said, let us look beyond the veil to analyze naval UFO legacy programs.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.080
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we take a direct

05:14.080 --> 05:18.840
investigation into UFO legacy programs under the United States Navy.

05:18.840 --> 05:24.040
We will direct our focus on three key pillars relevant to today's discussion, collection,

05:24.040 --> 05:27.920
origin, exploitation of non-human craft and technology.

05:27.920 --> 05:32.960
In this investigation, we will analyze the alleged structure of naval UFO programs, study

05:32.960 --> 05:38.400
key figures associated with said programs, evaluate a handful of incredibly intriguing

05:38.400 --> 05:50.960
USO retrieval cases, and identify naval installations alleged to hold non-human craft and biologics.

05:50.960 --> 05:57.400
I've been sitting on this information for quite a while now, and I felt quite nervous

05:57.400 --> 06:08.040
about it because the retrieval program undertaken by the CIA and elements of the US Navy is

06:08.040 --> 06:14.440
probably one of the most highly guarded secrets in the US government, and those protecting

06:14.440 --> 06:18.280
it can be quite nasty, and I was warned about that.

06:18.280 --> 06:23.520
On 20 September 2024, excellent UK-based journalist Christopher Sharpe in the Liberation

06:23.520 --> 06:29.280
Times posted an article titled, quote, Paradigm changing UFO transparency legislation fails

06:29.280 --> 06:31.800
in Congress for second consecutive year.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.200
The piece discussed the unfortunate dismissal of the UAP Disclosure Act in the Fiscal Year

06:36.200 --> 06:39.760
2025 National Defense Authorization Act.

06:39.760 --> 06:45.200
This exclusion of the UAPDA is another topic for another day as such bombshell legislation

06:45.200 --> 06:49.960
could very well have begun the unraveling of UAP legacy program secrecy.

06:49.960 --> 06:55.640
The September 20 article pivots rapidly discussing multiple programs orchestrated by the CIA's

06:55.640 --> 07:00.440
Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations, alongside Department

07:00.440 --> 07:04.960
of Defense and Department of Energy components that have for decades bypassed democratic

07:04.960 --> 07:09.120
oversight to retrieve advanced technologies of unknown origin.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.680
If this CIA DS&T sounds familiar to you, it is likely because this CIA component has been

07:14.680 --> 07:20.560
accused on myriad occasions by Chris Sharpe and Dr. Eric Davis, as directly participating

07:20.560 --> 07:24.440
in and obfuscating data around UFO retrievals.

07:24.440 --> 07:29.640
For example, Glenn Gaffney, former CIA DS&T director, has been labeled as the gatekeeper

07:29.640 --> 07:35.200
who ceased Lockheed Martin's attempts to divest UFO materials, likely the 1953 Kingman

07:35.200 --> 07:36.440
Arizona crash.

07:36.440 --> 07:42.840
To the OSAP program in 2008, additionally, former CIA DS&T deputy director Doug Wolfe

07:42.920 --> 07:48.280
aided in founding the CIA OGA, or Office of Global Access in 2003.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.960
Wolfe and the OGA have been accused by Sharpe and others as participating in retrievals

07:52.960 --> 07:57.720
outside of the United States with JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command.

07:57.720 --> 08:03.640
Anyways, the 20 September Sharpe article proceeds to detail some truly startling revelations.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.160
Quote,

08:04.200 --> 08:09.680
Multiple programs are understood to be orchestrated by the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology

08:09.680 --> 08:14.880
and its Directorate of Operations, including its Maritime Branch, alongside components

08:14.880 --> 08:19.520
of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, U.S. Navy, National Reconnaissance

08:19.520 --> 08:25.320
Office, Space Command, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and Joint Special Operations Command.

08:25.320 --> 08:29.560
According to Liberation Times sources, missions carried out by these programs include the

08:29.560 --> 08:34.600
retrieval of objects from beneath the oceans, involving the CIA's Directorate of Operations,

08:34.600 --> 08:39.600
the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, coordinated between the CIA and U.S. Navy,

08:39.600 --> 08:44.520
United States Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanographic

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
Institute.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.840
Additionally, the retrieval of objects on foreign soil is conducted with the involvement

08:49.840 --> 08:55.200
of the CIA's Office of Global Access and Joint Special Operations Command, end quote.

08:55.200 --> 09:00.840
Sharpe directly named military and intelligence organizations involved with ocean-based retrieval,

09:00.840 --> 09:06.640
including two institutions almost never discussed, the Neuro-National Underwater Reconnaissance

09:06.640 --> 09:11.480
Office and WHOI, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.320
But before we break down these statements, I must detail the evolution of this article

09:15.320 --> 09:20.200
as it allows us to study in Chris Sharpe's own words, information detrimental to his

09:20.200 --> 09:21.200
safety.

09:21.200 --> 09:27.880
By 22 September 2024, the article was revised, redacting all information about the Navy, Neuro,

09:27.880 --> 09:31.200
Woods Hole, NGA, NRO, JSOC, etc.

09:31.200 --> 09:37.880
The new Bear Bones edition still discussed the CIA, DS&T, DOD, and DOE, but all true

09:37.880 --> 09:40.480
actionable data was stripped from the piece.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.280
Sharpe was accused by some Twitter users as making quote-unquote stealth edits to remove

09:45.280 --> 09:50.520
information from the article, but he responded by stating quote, this is sourced information.

09:50.520 --> 09:54.880
There is a real, extremely dangerous reason little information has been released about

09:54.880 --> 09:56.520
such programs.

09:56.520 --> 10:00.960
Content from the article was removed because of the threats posed to me, end quote.

10:00.960 --> 10:06.920
By 25 September 2024, five days after the original posting, Sharpe would once again edit the article

10:06.920 --> 10:12.400
and say quote, okay, so someone has recklessly put me at extreme risk, so I have updated

10:12.400 --> 10:18.320
last week's article relating to the UAPDA, reverting back to details previously mentioned.

10:18.320 --> 10:23.360
This time, the details are far more specific, so here it is, the alleged undersea retrieval

10:23.360 --> 10:25.160
program, end quote.

10:25.160 --> 10:29.520
This third edit is quite similar to the first piece, but expands on multiple departments

10:29.520 --> 10:35.900
and agencies named specialized assets and expertise to carry out undersea craft retrievals.

10:35.900 --> 10:41.080
In this latest iteration, Sharpe states for operations, Woods Hole provided deep submergence

10:41.080 --> 10:44.720
vehicles to quote support retrieval efforts, end quote.

10:44.720 --> 10:50.240
Deep submerged rescue vehicles or DSRV will be a crucial aspect of a USO retrieval operation

10:50.240 --> 10:52.640
covered much later on in this project.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.320
The third iteration does powerfully claim the undersea craft or quote, transfer to the

10:57.320 --> 11:01.800
office of naval research, which subsequently hands them over to defense contractors for

11:01.800 --> 11:04.080
detailed analysis, end quote.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.640
From this article, we can extract a powerful thesis, the US Navy works in conjunction with

11:08.640 --> 11:15.800
the CIA, DS&T, alongside JSOC or SOCOM forces, intelligence agencies such as the NRO, NGA,

11:15.800 --> 11:21.560
and shadowy NRO, as well as defense RDT&E facilities and private contractors to retrieve

11:21.560 --> 11:25.360
and store non-human craft found deep undersea.

11:25.360 --> 11:29.800
But let's really break this down, analyzing the targeted role of the CIA's Office of

11:29.800 --> 11:34.480
Global Access alongside JSOC and global soil-based crash retrievals.

11:34.480 --> 11:40.240
We can assume a similar structure for undersea retrievals where the CIA, DS&T, serves as the

11:40.240 --> 11:47.000
logistics coordinator while JSOC provides men-at-arms, industrial security, human intelligence, etc.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.280
In this apparatus, the NRO and NGA would harness reconnaissance satellites to provide SIGINT

11:52.280 --> 11:56.960
or signals intelligence to retrieval teams while the shadowy National Underwater Reconnaissance

11:56.960 --> 12:01.160
Office provides unknown methods of underwater reconnaissance.

12:01.160 --> 12:05.760
In such a system outlined by SHARP, retrieval operations would be done in tandem with the

12:05.760 --> 12:11.680
US Navy and contractors such as Lockheed Martin and their DSRV and Dry Submersible, as well

12:11.680 --> 12:16.240
as non-profit research facilities such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and their

12:16.240 --> 12:18.400
many deep-submergence vehicles.

12:18.400 --> 12:23.520
Finally, in this hypothesized naval UFO program, craft would be taken to various Office of

12:23.520 --> 12:28.520
Naval Research locations before being transferred to defense contractors to study.

12:28.520 --> 12:32.200
But in this program, I do think SHARP is missing a key step here.

12:32.200 --> 12:36.480
Many speak on joint USG contractor UFO legacy programs.

12:36.480 --> 12:41.320
But a cornerstone of my work has been discussing the missing intermediary, federally funded

12:41.320 --> 12:46.440
research and development centers, FFRDCs, and university-affiliated research centers,

12:46.440 --> 12:47.440
UARCs.

12:47.440 --> 12:52.000
I will not bore returning viewers of these details, but I often speak on how these semi-private

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
government-controlled RDT and E-Centers act as liaison between USG-slash-DOD and US Defense

12:59.000 --> 13:04.240
Contractors for UFO Reverse Engineering and Material Exploitation Programs.

13:04.240 --> 13:09.240
Such institutions would serve as subject matter experts and provide necessary R&D work on

13:09.240 --> 13:10.920
project materials.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.780
This would in turn keep knowledge access in T-U-O programs quite strict, only allowing

13:15.780 --> 13:20.720
contractor personnel with a need to know full insights into the full extent of the non-human

13:20.720 --> 13:23.560
materials on which the programs focus.

13:23.560 --> 13:29.060
The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs often entwined with unacknowledged special

13:29.060 --> 13:33.800
access programs, special access programs, and controlled access programs.

13:33.800 --> 13:38.960
Such UARCs include the Applied Physics Laboratories at John Hopkins University and the University

13:38.960 --> 13:43.800
of Washington, as well as the Applied Research Laboratories at the Universities of Hawaii

13:43.800 --> 13:48.920
at Minoa, University of Texas at Austin, and Pennsylvania State University.

13:48.920 --> 13:55.360
Penn State's UARC was established in 1945 by Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker.

13:55.360 --> 14:01.440
Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board Dr. Robert Sarbacher

14:01.440 --> 14:07.000
as participating in 1950's UFO retrieval and reverse engineering programs alongside

14:07.000 --> 14:08.960
Dr. Vannevar Bush.

14:08.960 --> 14:15.320
Walker would be contacted by various UFO researchers in the 1980s and make some startling revelations,

14:15.320 --> 14:21.320
not only admitting he himself was present at the 1965 Kexpert, Pennsylvania UFO crash,

14:21.320 --> 14:26.520
but also claiming he knew of the Majestic 12 and to engage in UFO legacy programs one

14:26.520 --> 14:30.520
would need to know about ESP, Extrasensory Perception.

14:30.520 --> 14:35.560
It is interesting how a former TRW board member and founder of Penn State's UARC would essentially

14:35.560 --> 14:38.880
confess he was part of a UFO legacy program.

14:38.880 --> 14:44.240
And by the way, as recently as 2013 the Office of Naval Research has displayed a keen interest

14:44.240 --> 14:45.760
in studying ESP.

14:45.760 --> 14:51.120
The O&R would even publish a quote, revolutionary program looking into six cents among humans

14:51.120 --> 14:55.000
to train personnel on intuitive decision making, end quote.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.120
Additionally, according to the testimony of Randy Anderson, the Navy, specifically the

14:59.120 --> 15:05.000
Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane and contractor SAIC, has engaged in recovered technologies

15:05.000 --> 15:10.040
that respond to human consciousness at the underground off-world technologies division.

15:10.040 --> 15:16.640
The Navy also engages in a tremendous roster of programs with FFRDC's Well Worth Our Interest,

15:16.640 --> 15:21.600
primarily the Center for Naval Analysis run by the CNA Corporation based out of Crystal

15:21.600 --> 15:23.640
City, Arlington, Virginia.

15:23.640 --> 15:28.560
Returning viewers will recall how a recently implicated Crystal City and a likely massive

15:28.560 --> 15:33.480
underground facility beneath a neighborhood in Pentagon as a major center for UFO legacy

15:33.480 --> 15:37.120
programs SAPs and USAPs.

15:37.120 --> 15:42.400
Many of the acronyms sharp listed in his work regarding undersea retrievals need much further

15:42.400 --> 15:43.480
analysis.

15:43.480 --> 15:48.280
And as we move forward in this investigation, it is paramount to recognize the Navy has

15:48.280 --> 15:53.920
indeed participated in at least one acknowledged USO retrieval operation.

15:53.920 --> 15:59.880
Recall the 1962 Bluegill Triple Prime detonation and subsequent UFO recovery discussed by late

15:59.880 --> 16:02.480
presidential advisor Harold Malmgren.

16:02.480 --> 16:07.800
This event took place during Operation Fishbowl, a series of high altitude nuclear tests.

16:07.800 --> 16:13.680
The Bluegill Triple Prime nuclear test accidentally disabled a nearby UFO that went careening

16:13.680 --> 16:15.080
into the waters below.

16:15.080 --> 16:21.520
The downed craft or quote unquote pod was searched for and recovered by the USS Safeguard.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.920
Historical logs from the Safeguard discussed the vessel alongside others such as the USS

16:25.920 --> 16:31.480
engage steaming to the water crash location, searching in a square grid pattern and employing

16:31.480 --> 16:34.680
divers to recover a quote unquote pod.

16:34.680 --> 16:39.880
During net recovery of this pod, the Safeguard actually lost power and the pod was released

16:39.880 --> 16:41.560
for helicopter pickup.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.000
This is a massively consequential case I would like to explore in more detail later

16:46.000 --> 16:53.640
on, but let's continue with this investigation.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.920
I would be willing to wager most watching this channel have heard of the National Reconnaissance

16:57.920 --> 16:59.480
Officer NRO.

16:59.480 --> 17:07.320
The NRO is considered alongside the CIA, NSA, DIA and NGA to be one of the big five US intelligence

17:07.320 --> 17:08.600
agencies.

17:08.600 --> 17:14.520
This agency within the US DOD has historically designed, built, launched and operated reconnaissance

17:14.520 --> 17:19.920
satellites providing signals intelligence to the NSA, imagery intelligence to the NGA

17:19.920 --> 17:23.280
and measurement and signature intelligence to the DIA.

17:23.280 --> 17:28.140
David Grush worked for both the NRO and NGA where he additionally served as the intelligence

17:28.140 --> 17:31.660
agency's liaison to the UAP task force.

17:31.660 --> 17:38.220
Since 2023, the NRO has had a provable program that tracks UAP projects sentient uncovered

17:38.220 --> 17:40.260
in FOIA documents.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.760
Sentient serves as a quote ongoing research and development program and quote that analyzes

17:44.760 --> 17:47.600
satellite data with AI capabilities.

17:47.600 --> 17:53.100
The program was also tasked with analyzing UAP data such as a six May 2021 incident where

17:53.100 --> 17:55.700
a small tic-tac object was detected.

17:55.700 --> 18:00.460
The sentient report states this tic-tac to be similar to other objects observed in redacted

18:00.460 --> 18:02.020
operating areas.

18:02.020 --> 18:07.860
In 2021, the NRO contributed to the ODNI's or Office of the Director of National Intelligence's

18:07.860 --> 18:12.300
report to Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committee on Progress made by the

18:12.300 --> 18:14.020
UAP task force.

18:14.020 --> 18:19.980
This discussion of the NRO and UFOs are interesting, seen as they contradict a 2015 statement made

18:19.980 --> 18:25.680
by the NRO which stated that no documentation relating to UFOs and that the topic was quote

18:25.760 --> 18:28.960
outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities.

18:28.960 --> 18:34.680
Furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches in the past and has located no records

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
end quote.

18:35.680 --> 18:41.160
The NRO has of course additionally been implicated in providing assistance for UFO crash retrieval

18:41.160 --> 18:42.480
operations.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.640
These accusations have been made by Chris Sharp discussed above and witnesses I've covered

18:46.640 --> 18:53.120
on this channel numerous times including Stephen Greer witness AH as well as USAF Master Sergeant

18:53.120 --> 18:59.800
Edgar Fouchet who claimed the NRO alongside the NSA and CIA managed the TR-3B Reverse

18:59.800 --> 19:03.160
Engineer Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

19:03.160 --> 19:08.520
A fascinating document allegedly released by the NRO surfaced in 1991.

19:08.520 --> 19:13.400
I have covered this document before in relation to Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team, a

19:13.400 --> 19:18.000
possible joint reverse engineering group out of Edwards Air Force Base in the Nevada Test

19:18.000 --> 19:19.600
and Training Range.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.760
This document is again worth our attention because of the countless groups of interest

19:23.760 --> 19:25.200
mentioned throughout.

19:25.200 --> 19:31.640
These include MagiOps, Red Flag MOC, Sea Spray SOG, and AquaTech SOG.

19:31.640 --> 19:36.400
Allegedly Stephen Greer gave this memo to Admiral Thomas Wilson from the Wilson Davis

19:36.400 --> 19:39.400
Notes in a 1997 meeting.

19:39.400 --> 19:44.520
This meeting did occur, this is not disputed, however according to Greer Wilson recognized

19:44.520 --> 19:50.080
at least one of the clandestine groups listed in this memorandum for record from the NRO.

19:50.080 --> 19:55.320
Though the NRO likely works with the CIA, DS&T, and Navy for USO Retrievals they are

19:55.320 --> 19:58.600
not our focus for naval legacy programs.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.200
The NRO was born based on a recommendation to President Eisenhower during a National

20:03.200 --> 20:04.880
Security Council meeting.

20:04.880 --> 20:10.280
The agency was formed to coordinate the Air Forces and CIA's reconnaissance activities.

20:10.280 --> 20:15.680
Lessor known is an additional agency formed to coordinate the CIA's and Navy's reconnaissance

20:15.680 --> 20:19.800
activities, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.600
This agency NRO is known as the Hidden Younger Brother of the NRO.

20:24.600 --> 20:30.560
Implications about this agency and naval USO retrievals are scant, seen as NRO is a classified

20:30.560 --> 20:34.960
black agency, but we will do everything we can to investigate.

20:34.960 --> 20:39.560
NRO itself has been widely considered to be a special access program.

20:39.560 --> 20:44.080
According to publications made by the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, quote,

20:44.080 --> 20:46.800
Most SAPs involve technology projects.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.360
At the Department of Defense there are relatively few SAPs involving sensitive human intelligence

20:51.360 --> 20:54.360
collection or exploitation methods.

20:54.360 --> 20:59.520
Examples of ongoing non-technology SAPs include interrogation protocols for high-level battlefield

20:59.520 --> 21:04.360
detainees in Afghanistan managed by the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Center of the

21:04.360 --> 21:05.360
DIA.

21:05.360 --> 21:09.960
And every single capability of all special mission units of the Joint Special Operations

21:09.960 --> 21:15.240
Command, one entire government agency, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,

21:15.240 --> 21:18.040
is protected by a SAP, end quote.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.880
From this statement we can learn NRO is an extremely rare example of an entire intelligence

21:22.880 --> 21:26.800
agency being protected via a special access program.

21:26.800 --> 21:32.040
But do not be mistaken, NRO is a very real program and we can find snippets of its very

21:32.040 --> 21:37.000
existence here and there including a drastic revelation we will touch on soon.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.460
This includes mention of NRO in a 1975 submission of documents to the Senate Select Committee

21:42.460 --> 21:44.360
on Intelligence.

21:44.360 --> 21:49.040
Included in a long list of National Security Council Intelligence Directives is a National

21:49.040 --> 21:55.280
Security Decision Memorandum 40, which details both NRO and NRO operations.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.280
According to the Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence by Nigel West,

21:59.280 --> 22:04.640
NRO began during the Cold War as a joint Navy CIA group to coordinate and fund special

22:04.640 --> 22:07.240
projects conducted by submarines.

22:07.240 --> 22:12.080
In his book, the U.S. Intelligence Committee, Jeffrey T. Richardson was able to learn even

22:12.080 --> 22:14.320
more about NRO, quote.

22:14.320 --> 22:20.480
In 1969, as a result of an agreement between the CIA and U.S. Navy, an underwater counterpart

22:20.480 --> 22:26.000
to the NRO, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, NRO, was established.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.560
With Secretary of the Navy, John Warner, as its first director, the office served as

22:30.560 --> 22:35.560
a means of managing the conduct of submarine intelligence missions and exploitation of their

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
product.

22:36.560 --> 22:42.000
Those missions involved the recovery of sunken submarines, the Soviet K-129, taping of the

22:42.000 --> 22:48.160
underwater Soviet communication cables, the Ivy Bells, a.k.a. the De Clemson Program,

22:48.160 --> 22:53.000
ocean floor mapping under a program named Desktop, an imagery and sighing collection

22:53.000 --> 22:59.280
from submarines, a program at one time designated the Special Navy Control Program, end quote.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.560
Author Jeffrey T. Richardson was even denied FOIA requests on NRO.

23:03.560 --> 23:08.480
From what we can learn, the agency has deployed several highly specialized ships and submarines

23:08.480 --> 23:14.800
including the USS Parsh, the Hughes-Glomar Explorer, the USS Halibut, the NR-1, and more

23:14.800 --> 23:17.360
recent the USS Jimmy Carter.

23:17.360 --> 23:22.760
Of particular note is the United States' first nuclear-powered submarine launched 1969

23:22.760 --> 23:27.560
the same year as NRO's founding and retired in 2008, the NR-1.

23:27.560 --> 23:32.520
This sub carried out numerous highly classified missions including search, object recovery,

23:32.520 --> 23:37.280
geological survey, oceanographic research and installation and maintenance of underwater

23:37.280 --> 23:38.440
equipment.

23:38.440 --> 23:44.600
One publicly acknowledged NR-1 mission occurred in 1976 with the recovery of an F-14 lost

23:44.600 --> 23:46.280
from an aircraft carrier.

23:46.280 --> 23:52.240
NRO seemingly performed operations to swarm a stranded Soviet submarine in 1981 in Swedish

23:52.960 --> 23:58.600
In response to statements made by former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stating NRO's

23:58.600 --> 24:03.440
submarine operations in Swedish waters were routine defense tests, a senior U.S. official

24:03.440 --> 24:04.440
said quote.

24:04.440 --> 24:07.000
I don't know why Weinberger said what he did.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.880
Covert submarine operations is the most secret thing we have.

24:10.880 --> 24:16.320
The decisions were taken by a subcommittee of DIA and CIA people, most likely the National

24:16.320 --> 24:20.960
Underwater Reconnaissance Office, but I will neither confirm nor deny any operation in

24:20.960 --> 24:22.800
Swedish waters end quote.

24:22.800 --> 24:28.560
An additional high-ranking CIA officer confirmed with the International Peace Research Institute

24:28.560 --> 24:33.800
Oslo that U.S. covert submarine retrieval operations were run in Scandinavian waters

24:33.800 --> 24:40.480
by NRO, whilst directed by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman from 1981 to 1987.

24:40.480 --> 24:45.880
Analyzing the inception of NRO and the retrieval of the K-129 Soviet submarine as detailed

24:45.880 --> 24:50.920
by Jeffrey Richelson, we may gain some keen insights into the organization and their alleged

24:50.920 --> 24:53.000
UFO retrieval missions.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.400
In Blind Man's Bluff, the untold story of American submarine espionage, NRO was established

24:58.400 --> 25:03.920
under CIA Director Richard Helms to address the sinking of the Soviet submarine K-129

25:03.920 --> 25:06.920
outside of Hawaii in 1968.

25:06.920 --> 25:11.480
Though the office was intended to act between the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology

25:11.480 --> 25:17.280
and Office of Naval Intelligence, quote, from the day NRO was formed, the CIA took charge,

25:17.280 --> 25:18.280
end quote.

25:18.280 --> 25:23.880
NRO has seemingly seen a tug of war of control through the CIA and Navy, but by 1972 the Navy

25:23.880 --> 25:29.680
regained some control of NRO, seeing Secretary of the Navy John Warner serve as its director.

25:29.680 --> 25:35.720
However, through NRO, the Navy and CIA DS&T's usage of the GLOMAR Explorer may be worth

25:35.720 --> 25:37.120
analyzing more.

25:37.120 --> 25:42.840
To address K-129, the CIA built the ship the GLOMAR Explorer mentioned above, which launched

25:42.840 --> 25:49.040
in 1972 to recover the sub under Project Jennifer, a.k.a. Project Azorian.

25:49.040 --> 25:54.920
Astoundingly, the ship carried a modern-day price tag of $1.68 billion.

25:54.920 --> 26:00.080
I would like to thank medium author Underscored for this great piece titled General Motors,

26:00.080 --> 26:03.320
GLOMAR Explorer, Lockheed Martin, and UAP Connections.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.600
His article will be in the video description.

26:05.600 --> 26:10.040
The piece explores the GLOMAR Explorer being involved in hidden programs beyond the scope

26:10.040 --> 26:16.720
of K-129 Soviet submarine recovery in 1974, and was additionally used for nearly two decades

26:16.720 --> 26:18.360
by Lockheed Martin.

26:18.360 --> 26:23.040
Since the ship was a NRO creation, we can reasonably assume these clandestine operations

26:23.040 --> 26:26.820
and Lockheed Martin's usage were conducted under NRO.

26:26.820 --> 26:32.160
The article discussed how in 1978 Ocean Minerals Company, whose prime contractor was Lockheed

26:32.160 --> 26:36.960
Missiles and Space Company now Lockheed Martin, leased the GLOMAR Explorer for quote-unquote

26:36.960 --> 26:39.160
deep sea mining operation.

26:39.160 --> 26:43.800
The question must be asked, did Lockheed, NRO, and the GLOMAR additionally partake in

26:43.800 --> 26:46.320
these undersea UFO retrievals?

26:46.320 --> 26:51.160
After all, later in this project, we will address a scintillating 1970s UFO crash retrieval

26:51.160 --> 26:56.320
case in which the GLOMAR Explorer allegedly retrieved a downed non-human craft.

26:56.320 --> 27:01.600
We will also discuss an incredible 1991 USO recovery in this project, in touch on how

27:01.600 --> 27:07.040
I believe NRO provided transportation and logistics assets to the Navy's Project Sand

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
Dollar.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.560
The clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve military-sensitive

27:12.560 --> 27:17.640
hardware and other items with national security importance from the seafloor of the continental

27:17.640 --> 27:20.640
shelf in deepest marine environments.

27:20.640 --> 27:26.200
Sand Dollar seemingly gained actionable leverage when in 1964 a chief scientist of the Special

27:26.200 --> 27:31.800
Project's Office of the US Navy, Dr. John Pena Craven, launched the Deep Submergence

27:31.800 --> 27:37.240
Systems Project which saw the Navy drastically improve deep sea engineering and exploitation

27:37.240 --> 27:45.640
capabilities, but much more on this later.

27:45.640 --> 27:50.640
The most astonishing discussion of NRO actually comes from a man mentioned dozens of times

27:50.640 --> 27:54.480
on this channel who self-admittedly served as its director.

27:54.480 --> 27:59.160
Thank you.

27:59.160 --> 28:07.840
I became the director of Naval Intelligence, 13 September 1974, brand new flag selectee

28:07.840 --> 28:09.560
that year.

28:09.560 --> 28:15.960
I also had a second hat, and they still don't want me to talk about it even now, of director

28:15.960 --> 28:18.440
of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.040
See, I think you have it classified.

28:22.040 --> 28:29.520
It's the organization that procured all of the sensitive reconnaissance systems to collect

28:29.520 --> 28:33.040
intelligence under the surface of the oceans.

28:33.040 --> 28:38.800
Bobby Ray Inman allows us an extremely rare opportunity to understand naval UFO slash

28:38.800 --> 28:43.440
USO legacy programs as well as the likely involvement of NRO.

28:43.440 --> 28:49.760
Inman served as a highly decorated four-star admiral in the US Navy from 1951 to 1982,

28:49.760 --> 28:56.440
while also serving as the NSA and CIA director and director of SAIC and Wackenhut.

28:56.440 --> 29:01.040
Of course, if you are unfamiliar with these two companies, SAIC is a premier contractor

29:01.040 --> 29:04.920
I have discussed and will discuss later in this video as being heavily involved with

29:04.920 --> 29:07.120
UFO legacy programs.

29:07.120 --> 29:12.800
SAIC was likely the contractor described by former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson

29:12.800 --> 29:17.960
as running the Off-World Technologies Division below the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane.

29:18.040 --> 29:22.480
Wackenhut was a contracted security company I have covered before that has often times

29:22.480 --> 29:29.240
been implicated as providing industrial security forces who have guarded UFO-related SAP locations.

29:29.240 --> 29:33.760
And of course, Inman's dual roles within US intelligence and the Navy also suits an

29:33.760 --> 29:36.200
organization like NRO perfectly.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.880
Anyways, Inman states in the above clip he took a hold of the highly secretive NRO in

29:40.880 --> 29:42.600
1974.

29:42.600 --> 29:47.920
Inman had only spoken publicly about NRO once before in an October 2021 interview with

29:47.920 --> 29:51.760
David Zerler, the director of the Caltech Heritage Project.

29:51.760 --> 29:56.000
At this time, Inman served on Caltech's Board of Trustees to which he had been appointed

29:56.000 --> 30:01.440
in 1989 on the behalf of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, and Congress.

30:01.440 --> 30:06.320
While discussing JPL's future as a productive national asset working alongside NASA, Inman

30:06.320 --> 30:11.840
was reminded of his Navy and NSA days during his tenure in the National Underwater Reconnaissance

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
Program.

30:12.840 --> 30:17.440
According to Inman, NRO served as a black program due to its constant need to pursue

30:17.440 --> 30:22.560
evolving, cutting-edge technological capabilities to outsmart adversaries.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.600
Later on in the interview, Inman touched on his role as director of Naval Intelligence

30:26.600 --> 30:31.040
and director of NRO whose very existence was still classified.

30:31.040 --> 30:35.280
In Inman's own words, he was harassed for even mentioning the office, quote,

30:35.280 --> 30:39.920
In recent years when I talked about it, I got a pretty hot letter telling me I was not

30:39.920 --> 30:44.840
permitted to talk in detail since they were all still classified, end quote.

30:44.840 --> 30:48.360
According to Inman, NRO was in essence a black program that, quote,

30:48.360 --> 30:53.460
Acquired the technology for undersea reconnaissance, ranging from conducting imagery of the ocean

30:53.460 --> 30:58.200
floors looking for anything which might be desirable from an intelligence point of view.

30:58.200 --> 31:02.360
Before my time, it had been engaged in the efforts to pick up a submarine off the ocean

31:02.360 --> 31:04.520
floor with the Glomar Explorer.

31:04.520 --> 31:08.720
By the time I took over, it was primarily designed to track the hardware to be used

31:08.720 --> 31:10.880
in modern collection activities.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.320
The actual missions were conducted by the services, by the U.S. Navy, by the submarine

31:15.320 --> 31:17.840
force, by the National Security Agency.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.240
I had already been exposed to the Glomar Explorer program when I was in Hawaii as the

31:22.240 --> 31:25.320
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, end quote.

31:25.320 --> 31:29.960
So from Inman, the U.S. Intelligence Committee in Blind Man's Bluff, we can learn the director

31:29.960 --> 31:35.120
of NRO dealt with technology acquisition and was also a high-ranking naval official ranging

31:35.120 --> 31:38.920
from Secretary of the Navy to Director of Naval Intelligence.

31:38.920 --> 31:43.520
You'll recall how Inman states he was exposed to NRO's Glomar Explorer in Hawaii.

31:43.520 --> 31:51.400
In 1974, the K-129 Soviet wreckage was picked up 1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii, however.

31:51.400 --> 31:57.200
Once again, later in this project, I will bring up an alleged UFO recovery in 1973, conducted

31:57.200 --> 31:59.240
by the Glomar in Hawaii.

31:59.240 --> 32:03.880
Could Inman possibly have been involved in this retrieval in an official capacity?

32:03.880 --> 32:09.520
But why exactly are these words from Admiral and former NRO director Bobby Ray Inman so

32:09.520 --> 32:10.520
important?

32:10.520 --> 32:15.720
I have spoken on this topic quite a few times, but as this directly involves U.S. Navy UFO

32:15.720 --> 32:18.480
legacy programs, let's dive back in.

32:18.480 --> 32:24.960
In 2022, on the Project Unity show, Inman claimed he had found quote-unquote plausible explanations

32:24.960 --> 32:28.280
for all UAP sightings.

32:28.280 --> 32:42.680
In my years' active service, I became intrigued by the whole issue of UFOs, and as I dug

32:42.680 --> 32:53.640
into it, I found there were plausible explanations for virtually everything that we had observed.

32:53.640 --> 32:58.320
Still recently, with the openness of Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, naval officials quite often

32:58.320 --> 33:00.840
denied the existence of UFOs.

33:00.840 --> 33:05.720
This dates all the way back to 1951, where the Office of Naval Research physicist, Ernor

33:05.720 --> 33:11.760
Liddell, stated in a public magazine article that all UAP reports were mirages or balloons.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.560
He stated trained observers were being fooled.

33:14.560 --> 33:20.120
These 2022 statements by Inman contradict much of this man's storied history.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.840
I started out extremely skeptical about this whole thing, I thought this was just rubbish

33:23.840 --> 33:28.960
from the tabloids, but I was surprised to find thousands of U.S. government documents

33:28.960 --> 33:33.280
from intelligence agencies that tended to indicate that there was a little bit more

33:33.280 --> 33:38.200
to this than met the eye, so I went to seek guidance from the various highest levels of

33:38.200 --> 33:42.440
the United States intelligence community, and I was quite alarmed at what I was able

33:42.440 --> 33:43.440
to learn.

33:43.440 --> 33:48.280
Now, we are, in this report that we're now going to show, we're going to hear a conversation

33:48.280 --> 33:49.840
featuring you.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.880
Tell me the context of that conversation.

33:51.880 --> 33:57.160
Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security

33:57.160 --> 34:02.040
Agency in the United States, Deputy Director at CIA, Director of Naval Intelligence, and

34:02.040 --> 34:08.080
a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist, and clearly someone that if this was really

34:08.080 --> 34:14.320
accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man

34:14.320 --> 34:15.640
who had to know.

34:15.640 --> 34:20.280
So I was able to contact him, thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here

34:20.280 --> 34:28.960
in the U.K., and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered

34:28.960 --> 34:32.480
under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have

34:32.480 --> 34:35.400
possession of the hardware associated with this.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.400
In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.400
A craft.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.400
A spaceship.

34:39.400 --> 34:43.840
Several of them, and they were in operational condition, which I assume suggested that they

34:43.840 --> 34:47.720
had been in contact, that they had been given these craft for some reason or another, because

34:47.720 --> 34:49.680
they certainly weren't crashed vehicles.

34:49.680 --> 34:54.800
In a 1989 telephone call, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman would tell NASA mission specialist

34:54.800 --> 35:00.880
Bob Eschler, Deputy Director of the CIA, DSNT, Everett Heineman, would be the best person

35:00.880 --> 35:06.080
to ask if recovered vehicles would be available for technological research outside of military

35:06.080 --> 35:07.080
circles.

35:07.080 --> 35:12.200
To quote Inman in this call, quote, the deputy director for science and technology at CIA

35:12.200 --> 35:13.760
is named Everett Heineman.

35:13.760 --> 35:17.360
He is in fact getting ready to retire in the very near future.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.040
That may make him somewhat more willing to have dialogues than he otherwise would have

35:21.040 --> 35:22.040
had.

35:22.040 --> 35:26.280
When I knew him in that period seven to ten years ago, he was a person of very substantial

35:26.280 --> 35:29.040
integrity and just good common sense.

35:29.040 --> 35:33.120
So as a place to start, he would clearly be high on the list, end quote.

35:33.120 --> 35:38.040
And we actually have recorded snippets of this phone call between Eschler and Inman.

35:38.040 --> 35:44.640
Do you anticipate that any of the recovered vehicles would never become available for

35:44.640 --> 35:48.440
technological research outside of the military circles?

35:48.440 --> 35:53.400
Ten years ago, the answer would have been, whether it's time it evolved, they're beginning

35:53.400 --> 35:57.040
to become more open on it, there's a possibility.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.120
Eschler would go on to receive this call from Admiral Inman.

36:00.120 --> 36:06.360
Mr. Eschler, this is Tom King, an Admiral Inman's office, yet you would be breaching

36:06.360 --> 36:12.280
confidence and or violation of the secret three laws and discussing his involvement

36:12.280 --> 36:13.800
in any matter.

36:13.800 --> 36:18.920
Interesting how Inman, a former neuro director, would refer Eschler to a CIA DS&T director

36:18.920 --> 36:21.240
for recovered anomalous vehicles.

36:21.240 --> 36:26.240
CIA DS&T was, of course, one half of the founding agencies behind neuro.

36:26.240 --> 36:32.200
To note, while Heineman served as CIA DS&T deputy director from 1979 to 1982, he would

36:32.320 --> 36:38.520
go on to direct program B in the National Reconnaissance Program from 1982 to 1989.

36:38.520 --> 36:43.080
Possibly, this is where a neuro director and NRO program director first encountered

36:43.080 --> 36:45.880
UFO legacy programs together.

36:45.880 --> 36:50.080
Heineman and Eschler arranged to meet at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia,

36:50.080 --> 36:52.080
10 August, 1989.

36:52.080 --> 36:57.920
In this meeting, Heineman would deny any knowledge of UFO or UFO legacy programs, however, in

36:57.920 --> 37:04.480
2022, Twitter user RGH underscore UFOs would contact Heineman regarding comments made by

37:04.480 --> 37:08.640
Inman that Heineman was knowledgeable on U.S. UFO programs.

37:08.640 --> 37:13.800
In this instance, Heineman did not deny, but instead said, quote, I am a long way and quite

37:13.800 --> 37:17.840
a few years from working in the area you are researching, end quote.

37:17.840 --> 37:23.040
Heineman would offer to answer any questions relating to UFOs, but never responded to RGH,

37:23.040 --> 37:28.000
and as of this time, I have additionally attempted to contact Heineman to no response.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.440
RGH's inquiries into UFO programs revolved around Heineman's time in the NRO's program

37:33.440 --> 37:38.760
B. As we just mentioned above, program B served as the CIA's initiative to build and operate

37:38.760 --> 37:41.200
satellites for sigint purposes.

37:41.200 --> 37:45.280
Heineman was the first chief of the facility for the ground element of the program in Pine

37:45.280 --> 37:46.800
Gap, Australia.

37:46.800 --> 37:50.720
It is fascinating to think Heineman could have been working on UFO legacy programs in

37:50.720 --> 37:57.320
the 1980s out of the illustrious and infamous Pine Gap for a joint CIA and NRO program.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.520
More pertinent to our investigation today, Inman would additionally connect Echler with

38:01.520 --> 38:05.200
another former director of Naval Intelligence, Sumner Shapiro.

38:05.200 --> 38:09.040
It is unknown if like Inman, Shapiro served on the NRO.

38:09.040 --> 38:14.080
In 1989, Echler met Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with the group

38:14.080 --> 38:19.760
that managed UFO information, and at this time Shapiro was retired as director of Naval

38:19.760 --> 38:23.600
Intelligence and served as an executive with BDM International.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.400
BDM is of course a former defense contractor purchased by Northrop Grumman, I directly

38:28.400 --> 38:32.240
accused of being involved with UFO legacy programs.

38:32.240 --> 38:37.240
Shapiro told Echler factions within the U.S. possess extra-terrestrial vehicles that he,

38:37.240 --> 38:40.240
Shapiro, had even studied at close quarters.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.740
According to the former DNI, teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them

38:44.740 --> 38:47.280
around the country to different laboratories.

38:47.280 --> 38:52.800
This craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an exact sequence

38:52.800 --> 38:54.320
to be put back together.

38:54.320 --> 38:59.160
However, Shapiro was incredibly careful with what information he divulged to Echler, never

38:59.160 --> 39:04.200
specifying where vehicles and technology were taken to protect classified information.

39:04.200 --> 39:09.040
Echler would meet Shapiro for a second time in the Admiral's Virginia home in 1990.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.840
This visit was far less actionable and concluded abruptly.

39:12.840 --> 39:16.120
According to Bob Echler, as relayed by author Timothy Good, quote,

39:42.840 --> 40:00.280
But before we move on from discussing Echler and insights he gained from senior naval officials,

40:00.280 --> 40:05.720
Echler would also claim Navy EMP experiments were utilized out of Pensacola Naval Air Station

40:05.720 --> 40:08.400
to down UFOs for retrievals.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.920
These involved Empress and Empress II onboard EMP generators.

40:12.920 --> 40:18.400
Inman and Shapiro are not the only naval officials who have spoken on UFO legacy programs.

40:18.400 --> 40:23.840
In 2021, now deceased former Navy Director of Science and Technology Development, Nats

40:23.840 --> 40:30.160
Kobitz told Ross Colthart he was, during his service, read into a Navy UFO crash retrieval

40:30.160 --> 40:32.200
and reverse engineering program.

40:32.200 --> 40:37.400
Although Kobitz didn't actively engage with TUO or technologies of unknown origin, he

40:37.400 --> 40:41.960
was read into an active program that had retrieved multiple UAP.

40:41.960 --> 40:47.680
He called me on an open line out of the blue and I could barely believe who he was.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.160
His name was Nats Kobitz.

40:50.160 --> 40:57.400
He was the US Navy's former long-time director of science and technology development, their

40:57.400 --> 41:03.720
chief R&D scientist, their chief geek for many years, for over 30 years.

41:03.720 --> 41:10.120
And sadly, when I caught up with him, he was dying from cancer and faked dictated that

41:10.120 --> 41:12.800
I caught him at the perfect time.

41:12.800 --> 41:19.880
And over several months, he finally opened up to me about what he was on his own admission

41:19.880 --> 41:22.200
read into.

41:22.200 --> 41:28.720
He was briefed on the program and he told me that he had been read into a classified

41:28.720 --> 41:37.440
program involving retrieved non-human technology, recovered alien spacecraft.

41:37.440 --> 41:42.360
He eventually admitted that he was officially briefed that America had retrieved multiple

41:42.360 --> 41:49.280
non-human craft and that he was aware there was a secret operation underway for decades

41:49.280 --> 41:55.360
in his words to undertake to reverse engineer them.

41:55.360 --> 42:02.200
He admitted that most of what he knew was effectively hearsay, although from some excellent

42:02.200 --> 42:03.840
official sources.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.920
This is something he'd been briefed into in his official capacity.

42:08.920 --> 42:15.080
He did admit that on one occasion he was flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, literally

42:15.080 --> 42:22.200
taken deep underground, taken to a secure room and shown what looked like some kind

42:22.200 --> 42:29.320
of bulkhead from a craft which he believed was constructed in a way that defied conventional

42:29.320 --> 42:31.400
explanation.

42:31.400 --> 42:39.200
The craft's skin and inner bulkhead were composites bonded at an atomic level.

42:39.200 --> 42:44.000
He suspected it was non-human intelligence technology.

42:44.000 --> 42:50.080
But being the scientist he was infuriatingly, he wouldn't say to me it was alien tech.

42:50.080 --> 42:57.920
He would just say it was something he had never seen that any human could make.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.920
That was a patriot.

42:58.920 --> 43:02.360
He was a decent, honorable public servant.

43:02.360 --> 43:07.520
He respected the fact that this program was being kept secret for a reason.

43:07.520 --> 43:13.240
But as a scientist, he also recognized that the American public and especially Congress

43:13.240 --> 43:18.400
had the right to know what was being done with taxpayer dollars.

43:18.400 --> 43:24.880
And he frankly told me that as far as he knew, there was no good justification for keeping

43:24.880 --> 43:31.240
it secret.

43:31.240 --> 43:35.880
Remember all the way back to Chris Sharpe's mysterious reporting on USO Legacy programs

43:35.880 --> 43:40.560
involving the CIA, DSNT, Navy, Neuro, SOCOM and others.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.920
To quote Chris in the third iteration of the article, quote, it is further understood that

43:44.920 --> 43:49.800
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has provided deep-submergence vehicles to support

43:49.800 --> 43:51.600
these retrieval efforts, end quote.

43:51.600 --> 43:56.960
Woods Hole, or WHOI as I will call them here, is quote, dedicated to advancing knowledge

43:56.960 --> 44:01.160
of the ocean and its connection with the earth systems through a sustained commitment to

44:01.160 --> 44:05.920
excellence in science, engineering and education, and to the application of this knowledge to

44:05.920 --> 44:08.560
problems facing society, end quote.

44:08.560 --> 44:13.560
The non-profit research and higher education facility is dedicated to the study of marine

44:13.560 --> 44:15.720
science and engineering.

44:15.720 --> 44:20.960
During the Cold War, 1985 to be exact, the US Navy deployed a classified mission to investigate

44:20.960 --> 44:26.680
the wreckage of the USS Thresher and USS Scorpion, which had sunk in the North Atlantic Ocean

44:26.680 --> 44:30.440
at depths of between 10,000 and 15,000 feet.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.360
Sounds like a neuro-investigation, no?

44:32.360 --> 44:36.640
While this mission led to the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, the operational

44:36.640 --> 44:41.680
team and vessel that discovered the RMS Titanic was from Woods Hole.

44:41.680 --> 44:48.040
WHOI employs a host of highly advanced underwater vehicles that include human-occupied submersibles,

44:48.040 --> 44:51.400
remote-controlled vehicles, autonomous and towed robots.

44:51.400 --> 44:57.080
These include the AUV Sentry Autonomous Exploration Vehicle capable of exploring depths of nearly

44:57.080 --> 45:03.720
20,000 feet or 6,000 meters, the HOV Alvin, a three-person research submersible, and the

45:03.720 --> 45:07.920
HOV Deepsea Challenger used by filmmaker James Cameron.

45:07.920 --> 45:14.240
WHOI works closely with US military, specifically the Navy, where it develops technology including

45:14.240 --> 45:20.400
ocean battle space sensors, unmanned undersea vehicles, and acoustic navigation and comm systems.

45:20.400 --> 45:25.680
As a matter of fact, going back decades Woods Hole was involved with the Atomic Energy Commission,

45:25.680 --> 45:30.840
the precursor to the Department of Energy that highly likely housed UFO legacy programs while

45:30.840 --> 45:37.240
also serving as the gatekeepers for UFO data and materials, misclassifying such as trans-classified

45:37.240 --> 45:39.040
foreign nuclear material.

45:39.040 --> 45:45.240
From 1948 to 1949, a gentleman named William Webster served on the Military Liaison Committee

45:45.240 --> 45:47.240
for the Atomic Energy Commission.

45:47.240 --> 45:52.320
Webster was not only a member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation, but was

45:52.320 --> 45:57.800
also a trustee of the Rand Corporation and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.

45:57.800 --> 46:03.920
WHOI even manages the Navy Oceanographic Research Laboratory for the Department of the Navy.

46:03.920 --> 46:10.360
This WHOI lab is now part of the Naval Research Laboratory NRL, however, the National Oceanographic

46:10.360 --> 46:16.400
Research Laboratory was formed by a Federal Contract Research Center, or FCRC, the precursor

46:16.400 --> 46:20.560
to FFRDC, which I talk about quite often.

46:20.560 --> 46:25.680
Present day, Woods Hole also manages projects for the Office of Naval Research, such as Project

46:25.680 --> 46:26.800
Sundance.

46:26.800 --> 46:32.960
In fact, since 2002, Woods Hole has been awarded over $3.4 billion in federal awards

46:33.040 --> 46:36.760
in the form of contracts, subcontracts, and grants.

46:36.760 --> 46:41.720
Analyzing such contracts, we can find some data of extreme interest, such as National

46:41.720 --> 46:46.720
Defense R&D Services with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, whose crane division I have

46:46.720 --> 46:52.840
directly accused runs an underground installation with Science Applications International Corporation,

46:52.840 --> 46:55.680
housing the Off-World Technologies Division.

46:55.680 --> 47:02.640
Historically, WHOI has been awarded these contracts by NSWC via sole-source contracts, a contract

47:02.640 --> 47:08.120
method Dr. Eric Davis has spoken of, that are used in UFO legacy programs to maintain

47:08.120 --> 47:10.560
compartmentalization and secrecy.

47:10.560 --> 47:15.920
Woods Hole is given such sole-source, indefinite delivery contracts because, quote, the government

47:15.920 --> 47:21.840
believes that the supplier has unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained, end quote.

47:21.840 --> 47:28.080
And speaking of SAIC, Woods Hole has also been granted R&D contracts with SAIC and NSWC

47:28.080 --> 47:31.360
Crane Weapon Systems Division, JXN.

47:31.360 --> 47:35.720
But it doesn't stop there, Woods Hole has been given numerous indefinite delivery and

47:35.720 --> 47:41.680
definite quantity NSWC contracts to build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support

47:41.680 --> 47:52.800
unmanned undersea vehicles specifically for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center installations.

47:52.880 --> 47:58.920
Now we finally get to the most interesting part of this video, a deep sea USO recovery

47:58.920 --> 48:03.600
experience that ties together much of what we have discussed on today's episode.

48:03.600 --> 48:09.880
This story first appeared on Art Bell's Coast to Coast call-in episode on 19 April 2002,

48:09.880 --> 48:14.560
and I plan on using clips of the audio here, however, if people would be interested in

48:14.560 --> 48:19.640
fully released audio where I work with a 3D artist to recreate the encounter, please let

48:19.640 --> 48:20.640
me know.

48:20.640 --> 48:25.960
In this live radio call-in show, Art Bell was contacted by a retired Marine Corps Lieutenant

48:25.960 --> 48:26.960
Colonel.

48:26.960 --> 48:31.920
The caller, first name Mark, had been assigned to 22 area camp Pendleton to work with the

48:31.920 --> 48:37.840
first air delivery unit before being stationed at Okinawa, Japan at the Fatima USMC Air

48:37.840 --> 48:38.840
Station.

48:38.840 --> 48:43.800
It was here he began doing rescue diving work on weekends alongside a Navy crew.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.920
Mark would form a friendship with the Lieutenant and the Navy who would go on to become a commander

48:47.920 --> 48:52.040
of a DSRV or Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle unit.

48:52.040 --> 48:59.160
The friendship I made later came back that I was assigned or requested to join this DSRV

48:59.160 --> 49:03.040
unit and did and was reassigned to Virginia.

49:03.040 --> 49:07.480
And basically what we did was a deep sea rescue and recovery.

49:07.480 --> 49:12.720
If we had a downed aircraft, we would go and try to rig the craft to get it back.

49:12.720 --> 49:17.400
Anything, any anomaly that we wanted to look at, basically we were sent, there were several

49:17.400 --> 49:19.440
teams that did the same thing we did.

49:19.440 --> 49:23.400
How deep did you go?

49:23.400 --> 49:28.640
We could go two miles, excess miles, you're pretty much pushing it.

49:28.640 --> 49:32.400
This particular incident I wanted to tell you about was out of my mind.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.720
You're saying you could go over 10,000 feet?

49:34.720 --> 49:35.720
Yes.

49:35.720 --> 49:36.720
Wow.

49:36.720 --> 49:38.720
All right, anyway, go ahead.

49:38.720 --> 49:43.720
Well, I'll say the particular incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile

49:43.720 --> 49:46.320
and a half of water north Atlantic.

49:46.320 --> 49:51.000
The specific mention of DSRV is critical to this entire investigation.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.720
The United States created two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that operated within the U.S.

49:55.720 --> 49:58.720
Navy from 1970 to 2008.

49:58.720 --> 50:04.920
Mystic, DSRV-1 and Avalon, DSRV-2 were products of the Lockheed Missile and Space Company

50:04.920 --> 50:06.840
in Sunnyvale, California.

50:06.840 --> 50:13.120
DSRVs are to this day some of the most technologically advanced submersibles in the entire world.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.960
These two vehicles were capable of deploying anywhere in the world transported within a

50:16.960 --> 50:22.680
truck, C-5 Galaxy, or naval vessel to piggyback efficient routes to rescue crews of stranded

50:22.680 --> 50:25.480
submarines within 72 hours.

50:25.480 --> 50:29.840
These highly advanced submersibles employed a guidance system more complex than Apollo

50:29.840 --> 50:35.240
11's, allowing the DSRVs to hover in place in strong ocean currents to mate with disabled

50:35.240 --> 50:36.440
submarines.

50:36.440 --> 50:42.200
The Navy conducted numerous exercises with DSRVs-1 and 2, but no official rescues were

50:42.200 --> 50:43.680
ever conducted.

50:43.680 --> 50:49.960
And this is due to no American subs sinking since 1971, and 1972 saw the introduction

50:49.960 --> 50:52.160
of DSRVs-1 and 2.

50:52.160 --> 50:57.960
It is interesting to note, DSRV was born from 1964's Deep Submergence Systems Project,

50:57.960 --> 51:03.240
DSSP, to increase and develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities.

51:03.240 --> 51:08.160
The project was initially founded out of the Navy's special program Office, and DSRV's

51:08.160 --> 51:14.720
launch date of 70-71 dovetails closely with the beginning of Neuro in 1969.

51:14.720 --> 51:19.520
Interesting how the DSSP was also founded partly out of the loss of the USS Thresher,

51:19.520 --> 51:23.840
the same sub Woods Hole was attempting to find when it discovered the Titanic.

51:23.840 --> 51:29.360
If this story is true, this means DSRV, Mystic, and Avalon's practice missions were really

51:29.360 --> 51:32.520
to retrieve underwater aircraft and vehicles.

51:32.520 --> 51:37.600
And this is most likely fact, as Dr. John Pena Craven, chief scientist of the special

51:37.600 --> 51:43.240
program's Office of the Navy and first head of the DSSP, wrote regarding DSRV and classified

51:43.240 --> 51:44.560
operations quote,

51:44.560 --> 51:49.160
There were many highly classified missions associated with national security that cannot

51:49.160 --> 51:51.760
be accomplished without a DSRV system.

51:51.760 --> 51:56.200
The specific operational needs of these missions could not be anticipated, but they were certain

51:56.200 --> 51:57.200
to occur.

51:57.200 --> 52:02.360
Thus, a DSRV designed, constructed, and deployed for every conceivable rescue mission would

52:02.360 --> 52:06.920
also be available for the intelligence quote, unquote, mission impossible that were sure

52:06.920 --> 52:09.000
to occur, end quote.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.600
Craven's words here are particularly interesting.

52:11.600 --> 52:16.520
In 1964, Craven was tasked with spearheading the Deep Submergence Systems project, which

52:16.520 --> 52:22.240
led to the creation of the DSRV and other deep clandestine subs like the NR-1 to respond

52:22.240 --> 52:26.800
to unprecedented events at dramatically extended operational depths.

52:26.800 --> 52:32.200
In 1965, Craven was given a high-level intelligence briefing by a Naval intelligence officer

52:32.520 --> 52:38.160
and was informed on the existence of an extremely sensitive program named SandDollar.

52:38.160 --> 52:42.440
From Craven's book, The Silent War, the Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea, we get a

52:42.440 --> 52:45.560
rare chance to learn more about this program.

52:45.560 --> 52:50.000
SandDollar was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items with national

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
security importance from the sea floor of the continental shelf in deep marine environment.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.720
According to the Silent War, SandDollar was buried within the structure of yet another

52:58.760 --> 53:02.800
secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris sub-program.

53:02.800 --> 53:07.680
This hierarchy and compartmentalization of programs is something we have observed extensively

53:07.680 --> 53:11.160
in the Wilson Davis notes and throughout our investigation today.

53:11.160 --> 53:15.760
Craven even wrote the program is still classified to this day, that being 2002, quote, I was

53:15.760 --> 53:20.560
shown an inventory itemizing the items to be known on the seabed and a map of their

53:20.560 --> 53:23.280
distribution throughout the world, end quote.

53:23.280 --> 53:28.800
To expand on this statement, quote, the salvageable items of interest were spread around the globe.

53:28.800 --> 53:33.440
There were plenty of interesting objects on ocean floors worldwide, not just in the Bermuda

53:33.440 --> 53:37.680
Triangle, and there was an equal distribution of these objects between those that were lying

53:37.680 --> 53:40.600
on the continental shelf and those in deep oceans.

53:40.600 --> 53:44.720
There was a skew in favor of the continental shelf because of the shallow water, rocks,

53:44.720 --> 53:49.480
and shoals, but much of that hardware had either been salvaged or scattered by storms,

53:50.200 --> 53:54.760
Craven would even discuss two vessels previously mentioned to have been used in operational

53:54.760 --> 53:57.880
capacity by the Nuro, the Halibut and Seawolf.

53:57.880 --> 54:02.440
Craven claimed there was no need for maximum security for these submarines because they

54:02.440 --> 54:07.240
themselves, quote, they only transported top secret equipment and teams of industry

54:07.240 --> 54:11.720
specialists who would carry out unknown missions in unknown parts of the sea.

54:11.720 --> 54:15.240
The performers and the performances were invisible, end quote.

54:15.240 --> 54:20.840
As we explore this undersea recovery with DSRV units, we can now study the case with a strong

54:20.840 --> 54:26.600
thesis in mind. Chief scientist John Craven was tasked by the US Navy to drastically increase

54:26.600 --> 54:31.880
naval deep sea diving and engineering capabilities to retrieve undersea objects discovered by an

54:31.880 --> 54:34.920
astoundingly compartmented program called Sand Dollar.

54:34.920 --> 54:40.280
Craven's 1964 Deep Submergence Systems project would lead to the creation of clandestine

54:40.280 --> 54:45.480
submersibles that were capable of retrieving, quote, unquote, items of interest from the sea floor.

54:45.480 --> 54:50.040
Some of these submersibles, such as the DSRV units, would be shuttled via mother ships,

54:50.040 --> 54:52.600
including Nuro's Halibut and Seawolf.

54:52.600 --> 54:57.960
So now the question must be asked, was Sand Dollar the Navy's first UFO legacy program

54:57.960 --> 55:02.040
designated with the discovery, monitoring, and retrieval of UFOs?

55:02.040 --> 55:07.000
After all, Craven would state, quote, could I organize and manage a program to carry out

55:07.000 --> 55:11.880
this mission using the assets of the DSSP? Furthermore, could I carry it out in such

55:11.880 --> 55:16.760
a manner that my family and friends and closest professional colleagues would have no idea

55:16.760 --> 55:19.880
that I was involved in such a project? End quote.

55:19.880 --> 55:26.840
From the DSSP, the Navy planned to build six DSRV units and additional DSRVs known as Deep

55:26.840 --> 55:33.560
Submergence Search Vehicles, DSSVs, that were never officially built outside of Mystic and Avalon.

55:33.560 --> 55:38.840
These DSSV-DSRVs were intended for sea floor exploration and recovery,

55:38.840 --> 55:44.280
and to be capable of clandestine operations with an operational depth of 20,000 feet.

55:44.280 --> 55:49.480
So while we dive into Mark's story, I do think it is possible he and his Navy unit were assigned

55:49.480 --> 55:56.600
to a DSSV, not the two acknowledged Mystic and Avalon DSRVs. If this is the case, no such vessel

55:56.600 --> 56:01.000
in which Mark was operating was ever publicly acknowledged to have been built.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.840
But back to the story. Our story takes place in the early summer of 1991 at a depth of roughly

56:06.840 --> 56:14.200
1.5 miles in the North Atlantic 250 nautical miles or roughly 288 standard miles outside of

56:14.200 --> 56:19.880
Aberdeen, Scotland. Looking at 250 nautical mile radius outside of Aberdeen compared with the

56:19.880 --> 56:24.440
Atlantic Ocean depths, we can draw a reasonable estimate of where this retrieval incident would

56:24.440 --> 56:29.480
have taken place. Let us also account for some error in Mark's estimate and give a generous

56:29.560 --> 56:34.920
plus or minus 20% room for error in radius here. Therefore, our radius could be up to

56:34.920 --> 56:41.000
50 nautical miles larger, so we have a standard radius of 345 standard miles.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
And folks using the superior metric system here, I am sorry guys.

56:45.000 --> 56:51.480
Waters in the Atlantic near the UK are actually quite shallow, however. 345 miles almost due west

56:51.480 --> 56:57.160
of Aberdeen sees depths reaching over 8,000 feet, which is over our mile and a half claim.

56:57.160 --> 57:02.440
This area of ocean is known as the Rockall Trough, east of the Rockall Plateau. Hopefully further

57:02.440 --> 57:07.480
data can come from this very specific location at which this retrieval is alleged to have occurred.

57:07.480 --> 57:12.920
Mark's DSRV crew had been sent from Virginia, and as we know from a 2011 Nuclear Regulatory

57:12.920 --> 57:17.640
Commission emails detailing the tsunamis in Japan, both the east and west coast of the

57:17.640 --> 57:23.160
United States had employed a quote, very operational, ready deep-submergence rescue vehicle, end quote.

57:23.240 --> 57:28.760
On the DSRV, Mark served to operate computer equipment on the optical and electronic recognition

57:28.760 --> 57:33.720
side and also worked on mechanical aspects of the vessel with mechanical arms and rigging for

57:33.720 --> 57:38.680
object retrieval. Mark's team was dispatched after a survey vessel in the North Atlantic had

57:38.680 --> 57:43.960
picked up a radioactive signature on the seafloor. A second vessel equipped with a side scan determined

57:43.960 --> 57:48.600
a vessel to be resting on the seafloor. Naval authorities thought this to be a crashed foreign

57:48.600 --> 57:53.640
nuclear submarine. However, the radar signature had shown the object to be smaller than any known

57:53.640 --> 57:59.560
nuclear sub. Upon diving, Mark's DSRV attempted to contact the vessel and immediately realized

57:59.560 --> 58:06.280
this was not a sub, but shaped more like an aircraft. And what they did was send a vessel around

58:06.280 --> 58:12.200
with a side scan, picked up that there was a vessel on the bottom. They thought first possibly a

58:12.200 --> 58:17.240
submarine that had some kind of problem there, not ours obviously. Yes sir. We would have been in

58:17.240 --> 58:25.080
communication. The vessel came back, it was much too small, any sub that they were familiar with.

58:25.720 --> 58:31.160
And at that time we came on site. But you were getting some kind of nuclear signature from it?

58:32.360 --> 58:38.840
Right, there was a radiation from it. And the concern was, was it a weapon, some type of

58:38.840 --> 58:44.040
concealed weapon source or was it actually a power source? Right. And we were brought out

58:44.040 --> 58:50.600
from Virginia, steamed out. And not to give you specific minutes, seconds location, just

58:51.320 --> 58:57.080
approximately 250 miles out of Aberdeen, Scotland is where we were. You can draw a circle and

58:57.080 --> 59:04.680
narrate down pretty quick at that depth. You can limit the waters. Yes sir. But upon diving,

59:04.680 --> 59:12.680
we went down, like I said, just under a mile and a half. And we contacted the vessel,

59:13.560 --> 59:20.360
which we immediately recognized not as a submarine, but more of an aircraft.

59:22.200 --> 59:28.760
Communications back to the top, we were told to go observe, photograph, determine what we had. We

59:28.760 --> 59:36.200
thought at that point we had possibly a Russian or Korean aircraft with some type of contained

59:36.200 --> 59:43.880
weapon source. So as we went in. Yeah, that would be logical. We went in and this particular

59:43.880 --> 59:49.320
vessel was partially in the mud, submerged or buried under some mud, had been there for some

59:49.320 --> 59:54.520
period of time. And how much were you, what were you seeing of it? What shape? What we saw was the,

59:55.800 --> 01:00:02.920
I would say the rear two thirds. It was a triangular shape. It was waged more. Triangular.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.120
Triangular shape. And best likely to describe it, it would be nosed in with about two thirds

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:14.920
exposed to the back. Yes sir. And as you come out the triangular shape at the back, it was rounded

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:21.080
as it came to the corner. What would be the corner of the triangle? They were rounded on both sides.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:28.200
Oh my. Oh really? And this obviously not a conventional aircraft. Well one,

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:35.080
one comment was made in the SRV. The little lieutenant commander is also a good friend was,

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.400
my comment was, I don't believe it's Russian. And his comment was, if it is, it's not Russia

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:48.600
right now, you know, joking. And what, you know, the best way I can describe it, it was a charcoal

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:56.760
gray in color. It had some markings on the side. Sir, sir, listen, I'm coming to a break at the top

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:03.080
of the hour. Can you manage to hold on? I can if you'd like, yes. I would like, yes. Stay right

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.600
there, all right? You located this craft, which was a triangular in shape, and you were seeing the

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:17.720
back portion of it. Right. At this point, we, we'd come over almost what you, I would best describe

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:25.800
as broadside to, to the, the craft, the nose, what I would determine as the nose in was submerged in mud.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:32.360
Mark and his crew had no matching craft or pattern to cross reference this craft. The 60 to 70 foot

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:38.200
charcoal gray triangle with smooth edges, no windows, rivets, seams, or bolts, a rounded rear,

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:44.280
and hieroglyphic writing along the side did not lead the crew to suspect terrestrial origins.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.280
Mark and his Lieutenant Colonel friend both thought the craft to be extraterrestrial,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.880
but did not relay this to the surface out of fear of psych evaluations and to not risk communication

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.800
interception. The surface LPH vessel ordered the DSRV unit to return with still photography

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.680
and video of the craft. We do need to quickly address the markings on the side of the craft

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:11.480
that Mark relayed. And there were markings on the side of it, which were in the, in the skin itself.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.640
And how would you describe those markings? You don't know, I've heard this before, people

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:24.920
try to say hieroglyphics and all of this. It was not a, it was not any, any language or marking

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:32.680
which we would typically see, Russian Arabic, nothing we were trained or had seen previously.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:41.320
But hieroglyphic light. Well, I'll say hieroglyphic light, but more geometric patterns. There weren't

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:46.280
large walking individuals with bird heads and, and you know, when I think of hieroglyphics,

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:53.400
I think of individuals with a head, like a bird or wolf and then human body just didn't have,

01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.760
have those type of patterns. It was more geometric shapes, but, but you could tell some of the

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.720
actual characters repeated quite a bit of it was in mud. And then there'd be gaps

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.280
throughout a mud that you could see some repeating of the character. I have covered in great detail

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:18.200
the high confidence 1965 Kexpert, Pennsylvania, crashed retrieval in which numerous town residents

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:24.920
observed US military forces retrieve and transport a 12 foot acorn like bronze craft. Many such

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.480
witnesses described hieroglyphic style writing around the circumference of the lower lip of the

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.520
craft. And additionally, Danny Sheehan has stated in the classified project Blue Book Files,

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.200
he has seen images of a crashed UFO saucer that display geometric hieroglyphic style characters

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:45.400
along its circumference. This is a fascinating detail and connection to these other cases.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.840
After 12 hours of waiting after returning to the surface, the DSRV crew was ordered to dive again,

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.800
this time taking a marine archaeologist. The archaeologist made sketches of the craft and

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:02.520
even traveled down with his own personal computer. Where did this go from there? I mean, now you've

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:09.080
got this thing ID. Would you suddenly out of the picture or? Well, we're in the picture up,

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:15.320
up to the point where we're rigging and recovering. As I said, we took down a marine archaeologist.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:22.200
And one thing that was very interesting that this individual, we actually monitored currents,

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:30.680
did some things, temperatures and such at the site. He was making quite a bit of notes and,

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.480
you know, really not, not making a lot of comment, but he did make the comment when we asked,

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:43.800
you know, is this recent? Because there was no disturbed area around it, best way to describe it.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:49.800
It looked like it had been in place. And he said that it wasn't any more recent than at least 30 to

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:56.280
40 years, which really threw us back because this thing looked like something beyond, you know,

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.560
where we're at development-wise aircraft. And I still had to rule out that it was not

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:09.560
experimental aircraft at this point, someone's. But the point that he made that the buildup of

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:15.640
the silt mud in the front end would appear that this has fallen in place for a period of 30 years

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:22.600
or somewhere in the range 30 to 40 years. And you have, was there an attempt made at recovery?

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.200
There was a recovery made, not an attempt made, there was a recovery made of the craft.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:34.120
What do you know about that? On the third day of the operation, the DSRV crew dove for a fourth

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.640
time, this time to retrieve the craft. The team first used thrusters to remove silt and mud from

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.920
the craft's midsection. So Mark and others could attach equipment to try and lift the vehicle.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:50.120
Immediate problems arose as this crashed USO did not fall under the same procedures and

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:56.040
weight estimations used for conventional aircraft. Due to this, the DSRV crew had to make size and

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.400
base weight estimations. The craft's weight estimations was based on the closest size conventional

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:10.120
aircraft, the F-14. We had thrusted away a lot of the silt mud from the from the vehicle. Still had

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:16.680
a section, probably about the eight foot that was trapped or under depth, it was more of an angle to

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:23.720
it. So when we rigged it to bring it up rear first, use the best language I can, we were going to

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.120
try to lift the rear end up and bring this thing up on an angle and try to keep everything intact

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:38.040
and go. Yes sir. We're rigging that with our calculation for the rigging, the weight, brought

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:46.520
it up and it went probably about two and a half to three times the ascent as what we anticipated,

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.840
which immediately gave us the feel that we're dealing with something extremely light.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.960
Trailing the craft as it ascended, the DSRV crew noticed the underside of the craft was

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:02.360
completely smooth. No piping, exhaust or mechanical features existed on the underbelly of the triangle.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:07.320
When the vehicle was recovered, Mark got a clear look at the craft. It proved to be six to eight

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:14.280
feet longer than an F-14 at 62 feet, meaning this craft was 68 to 70 feet long. Mark stated

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:20.680
nothing like that existed in 1991 and as of the show in 2002, still nothing like that existed.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.520
The craft was a solid metal form with no cockpit and no windows.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:32.040
Right, it was a little bit, actually a little bit longer than the aircraft would be, probably

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:40.840
six to eight feet, I would say, in excess of what you would anticipate for F-14.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.360
Colonel straight out question is, do you believe that you recovered an alien craft?

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:55.400
I've never, you know, I've had conversations with the individual, my friend that actually was

01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:03.720
there, we're still in contact quite often. I can't definitively say that it was. I can only say that

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:09.800
it was an object that didn't belong there and certainly would not have belonged there 30 or 40

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:17.960
years prior to when we were on site and no visible means of, you know, if you anticipated it was an

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.720
aircraft and I saw a cockpit, I would say it was definitely somebody's here that was in development

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:29.400
but the technology would not allow you to fly to craft 30, 40 years ago.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.720
Within four hours, Mark and his entire crew were steamed off-site. Mark received no feedback or

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.920
debriefing on what the vehicle was, nor did he and his crew receive any threats or warnings,

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.720
not to speak about the incident. However, Mark did state when he joined the DSRV team,

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:52.200
he was ordered to sign some pretty lengthy NDAs. As we know from Dr. Craven and DSRV for clandestine

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.560
usage, this does not come as a shock. Mark would be subject to such intense secrecy regarding his

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.480
work on the DSRV. Mark stated, even if the DSRV retrieved a US vehicle, they were not allowed to

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.600
Art Bell got the original sketches of the retrieval by the naval lieutenant colonel

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.080
and Mark told Bell he would connect him with the naval officer. I am still trying to chase

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.360
down this case with the help of some high-profile naval officials. More investigation does need

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.880
to be done on this case since officially DSRV's mystic and Avalon had an operational depth of

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:29.720
just over one mile and it would be unusual to employ USMC divers for the time. For this reason,

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.760
I do think back to the 1964 proposal of six DSRV and DSSV under the Deep Submergence Systems

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:43.400
Project where only DSRVs one and two were built. Remember back to the words of Dr. John P. Craven,

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.120
chief scientist of the Navy Special Projects Office who discussed many classified operations

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.360
were performed by DSRV teams. I do think it possible DSRV units outside of Mystic and Avalon

01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:00.840
were built with capabilities akin to the DSSV units. 20,000 foot operational depth capacity

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:06.360
with a greater capability for seafloor navigation and object retrieval. And it is interesting of

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.200
course to point out the 1964 Deep Submergence Systems Project DSSP which aimed to increase and

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.680
develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities for Project Sand Dollar which

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:22.600
resulted in the creation of DSRV, occurred just two years after the October 1962 Blue

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:28.120
Guild Triple Prime US Navy UFO recovery. Additionally, this case piqued my interest due

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.720
to the presence of a crash triangle. So often in my videos I discuss many triangular sightings

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:40.840
being alien reproduction vehicles. Whether this be the TR3B XF131 Supercentinal or a long list

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:46.440
of prototypes I have wagered to be built in the late 70s into the early 2000s, I believe the US

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.040
saw heavy clandestine experimentation within USAPs to build triangular shaped alien reproduction

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.240
vehicles. But this triangular case harkens my attention back to the alleged Special Operations

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:04.920
1 Majestic 12 Manual. In this piece the SOM101 allegedly written in 1952 details are given to

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:10.120
extraterrestrial craft types including triangles which according to the document were very new

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.440
and very rare at the time. The DSRV retrieved the triangle allegedly in 1991. The marine

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.800
archaeologists claim the triangle had been buried for 30 to 40 years meaning the crash likely occurred

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:28.600
between 1951 and 1961. Interesting how this date range coincides with the Majestic 12 Special

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.720
Operations Manual claiming new triangular extraterrestrial vehicles were being spotted at the

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:44.280
time of the 1954 Manual. If these retrieval events are true and the inside sources of

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:50.520
Chris Sharp are correct, water-based USO and UFO recoveries are stationed at naval installations

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:56.360
and locations of the Office of Naval Research where they are then utilized in material exploitation

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.800
programs. Let us review some cases and testimony throughout history of downed craft stored at

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.760
naval installations. We will reference numerous sources here including the legendary Leonard

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:12.120
Stringfield whose work I referenced often in my dumb video. Stringfield's crash retrieval status

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:18.680
reports 1 through 7 are in my opinion the best crash retrieval work done by any investigator.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.800
I will also omit stories of China Lake and the testimony of Randy Anderson and the Off-World

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.920
Technologies Division as I have covered these stories and installations and experiences in

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:35.320
depth in the past. Leonard Stringfield was once contacted by letter in 1978 tipping him off to

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.960
Derward Buddy Hack, a CPO radar observer who in 1952 while stationed at the Naval Air Station

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:47.320
Sunnyville, California disappeared out of sight. While serving at the Naval Installation Hack,

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.360
according to his family, accidentally entered a large door of a hangar that was temporarily

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:58.120
unguarded. There he encountered a massive saucer-shaped craft with rows of windows and when

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.160
the guards returned they forced Hack out and threatened him. Stringfield contacted multiple

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.040
members of Hack's family who confirmed hearing the story including his mother who not only confirmed

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.160
Hack's disappearance but also the saucer story. Hack's mother would hear him say quote,

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:20.600
it was certainly no aircraft of ours, end quote. In 1979, 6 February 1979 to be exact,

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:25.400
Stringfield received a letter from one Joan Jeffers. Jeffers stated she knew a retired

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.520
Ustaff Colonel who enlisted in the 40s and retired in the 70s. While stationed at an

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.480
Air Force radar facility, the Colonel would attend weekly commander's calls at the Naval

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:41.880
Air Station in New Brunswick, Maine. At one such meeting in 1956, the Colonel was shown a film by

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.320
Major Lester Goldberg that was apparently shot by the Ustaff. Interesting side note here, one

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.440
Major Lester Goldberg did in fact serve at the Brunswick Naval Air Station at this time and was

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:58.680
the commanding officer of the 654 aircraft control and warning squadron. The film showed a circular

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.880
metal silver colored disc on the ground. The interior of the craft was well lit and featured

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:09.800
smooth walls. The film also showed at least three bodies lying on tables. The beans were short and

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:15.640
they all looked similar in appearance featuring a sheen or gray color. None of the beans had any

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.480
external ears or hair, all appeared to be dead. Further sources of Stringfield, like the anonymous

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:28.280
Lieutenant Colonel X, would even state the Navy housed biologics. Such as in 1975, when Lieutenant

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:34.120
Colonel X claimed quote, bodies are now being flown outside of the US to a secret naval installation

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:40.680
on an island in the Pacific Ocean. End quote. Now the US Navy does employ multiple DOD laboratories

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.240
and MRTFBs or major range and test facility bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These include

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.680
the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center on the Andros Island Bahamas and Pacific Missile

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.200
Range Facility in Hawaii. There is also incredible research I plan to explore in the future conducted

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:04.120
by Dr. Richard Sotter that similar to deep underground military bases, the US Navy employs

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:11.080
deep underwater military bases. And those familiar with my discussion of MRTFB will recall such

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.720
installations as Dugway Proving Ground, Edwards 412 Test Wing, NAWC China Lake, Fort Hachuka,

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.440
the Nevada Test and Training Range, and more. Lieutenant Colonel X also brought forward

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.320
an interesting connection to the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual which claims deceased

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.200
biologics were taken to the Wright Patterson Blue Room while living entities were taken to the

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:39.720
OpNAC BBS 01. Some have guessed OpNAC is similar to OPNAV which is the Office of the Chief of Naval

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:46.120
Operations while BBS is the Bermuda Biological Station, an Atlantic based installation now

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.760
called BIOS. In Crash Retrieval Status Reports 3, Case 15b, Stringfield relayed a cat and mouse

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:58.280
game with witness AF and his brother Pete. This story took place at the Naval Air Base Yuma,

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:04.280
Arizona, now called the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, which is directly near Yuma Proving Ground.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.400
If you remember back to my video on Dumbs, the US Army Corps of Engineers took a tremendous

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:15.400
interest in building underground installations beneath Yuma County, Arizona. This case in question

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.880
really frustrated Stringfield, quote, what seemed to be a case of great potential,

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.800
including the emergence of photographs of a saucer in military custody,

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.360
became less so with the passing of time. Following a series of alleged interferences,

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:33.320
my sources said they feared even greater consequences and backed off into oblivion,

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.680
end quote. Stringfield reckoned this case to either be a ploy or example of the lengths legacy

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:44.520
operations will go to silence and formance. Witness Pete, a former US Marine, claimed to

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.600
have photographed a saucer-like craft at the Naval installation in Yuma, Arizona in 1967.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:56.120
Stringfield tried for months to meet Pete and his brother AF and organized to receive the photos

01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.640
by mail. AF even claimed to have sent numerous letters to Stringfield that were likely intercepted.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.680
Stringfield would speak to the men on the phone and learn Pete had been approached by some sort of

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.040
agency to stay quiet. An intriguing case to mention but a massive dead end for both Leonard

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.480
Stringfield and us. Our most fruitful case in Stringfield status reports can be found

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:23.880
in UFO crash retrieval status reports 3 under case A7. This case takes us to the Great Lakes

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:30.440
Naval Base in Northern Illinois in 1973. While we discuss this case, do keep in mind the Office

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:35.560
of Naval Research has a major Chicago department less than 40 miles away from the Great Lakes

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:41.800
Naval Station. Our encounter comes from one witness R.K., an E-4 grade instructor in Gunnery

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:48.440
School at the Great Lakes Naval Base from March 1973 to September 1974, destined for intelligence

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:55.240
school. I myself am aware of R.K.'s true name and am trying to vet this individual. On 14 July

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:01.160
1980, R.K. came to the House of Stringfield and relayed his encounter. In September 1973,

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.880
while instructor in Gunnery School, R.K. was assigned to guard the premises of a large

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:12.120
Quonset hut at Great Lakes Naval Base with orders not to let anybody within 100 yards.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.320
While on duty, R.K. was approached by a naval officer who handed him a sealed envelope to

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:22.840
deliver to the commander in the Quonset hut. Entering the facility, R.K. observed a strange

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:28.840
metallic craft 30 feet in length and 10 feet in height resting on a wooden platform. According

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:34.920
to R.K., quote, it was light silvery blue and shimmering. It tapered like a teardrop with a flange

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:40.200
running along its topside from one end to the other and there were no windows, end quote. R.K.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.760
could not linger in the hut due to the presence of other guards. Thus, he delivered the envelope

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:50.040
and returned to his post. R.K.'s encounter bore striking resemblance to the testimony of a sailor

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.960
he had met in San Diego just weeks prior whilst on special assignment. According to this sailor,

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.920
a UFO identical to the one R.K. would observe in the coming weeks at the Great Lakes Naval

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:06.920
Station was shot down by the Navy between Hawaii and the mainland in June of 1973.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:12.840
This UFO was picked up via destroyer's radar and came into view making three close passes and one

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:18.520
direct overflight over the destroyer. According to the sailor, the UFO was shot with a lucky hit

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:25.560
and crashed into a 350 foot deep water. The San Diego sailor claimed the object was retrieved by

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:31.480
the Glomar Explorer and shipped to Hawaii and sent stateside and finally to Chicago.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.440
The sailor even provided R.K. a sketch that was identical to what he had seen.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.080
But just hold on a second here, the claims of the Glomar Explorer retrieving the craft

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:48.120
are of significant consequence here. Glomar was run by Nuro, a joint naval in CIA-DSNT effort.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.560
If this story is true, this means the Navy, CIA, and intelligence organizations such as Nuro

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:59.400
downed a UFO and retrieved it from sea. The craft was then shipped to an ONR location where due to

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:04.360
being guarded on a wooden platform was likely destined for further transport and study. This

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:09.160
incident mirrors perfectly the 2024 claims of Chris Sharpe's informants.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.920
Other cases of naval bases in the Office of Naval Research possessing both information of

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:21.000
crashed disks and the materials themselves are plenty. In 1994, former New Mexico State rep

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.280
J. Andrew Kissner stated sources within White Sands Proving Ground in the Naval Research Lab

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:32.120
briefed him on recovered flying disks in 1947. These disks were given to the custody of the

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.640
Atomic Energy Commission and studied by national laboratories such as Los Alamos, Sandia, Rand,

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:44.760
MITRE, etc. This is very similar to my modern-day hypothesis of DOE working alongside FFRDC and

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:51.480
to exploit UFO materials. According to Kissner's naval sources, the UFO programs were signed into

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.440
Presidential Executive Order under Truman in 1948 with the National Security Council

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.400
serving as program coordinator. With support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Research and

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:07.240
Development Board ran by Dr. Vannevar Bush in the Naval Research Lab. Interesting to note as well,

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.920
in 2005, USAF veteran Stephen Walker would claim while serving at the Naval Support Facility in

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:19.080
Diego Garcia, he was exposed to the Navy conducting sensitive operations outside of a large hangar

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.800
at the northern end of the airfield. Base personnel were ordered to stay away from this

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:29.000
quote-unquote empty hangar. One night while the flight line was evacuated, the base was locked

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.360
down and personnel were ordered to stay inside away from windows for the arrival of a classified

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.960
aircraft. Walker claimed that despite listening for the craft for nearly half an hour, he heard no

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:46.200
jet engine, no brakes, no tires hitting the pavement, no idling, or no Air Force sounds.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.400
This experience is very interesting when analyzing the claims of Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet,

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:57.160
who claimed UFO programs were moved out of Area 51 in the early 90s because of intensive scrutiny

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:03.560
from the public on Groom Lake. UFOs, especially the TR-3B Reverse Engineer Triangle programs,

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:09.160
were relocated to various installations including Dugway Proving Ground and Diego Garcia.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:19.080
I must now circle back to early discussion of Neuro and reference back to U.S. Intelligence

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.520
Committee and discussion of Imogen and SIGINT collection from submarines, a program at one

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:30.200
time designated the Special Navy Control Program. Special Navy Control Program is quite similar

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:36.840
to something called the Navy Special Program or NSP. The NSP is a highly elusive naval office

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:42.360
that's similar to Neuro we can only find snippets of. The first ever mention I can find of the

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:49.400
Navy Special Program is in a 1974 Omnibus National Security Council Intelligence Directive alongside

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:55.640
the NRO. Remember, the NRO was not declassified until 1992, so this mention of the National

01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:00.920
Reconnaissance Program, which is the direct funding mechanism for the NRO, is likely to obfuscate

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:06.360
the program. But what exactly is this Navy Special Program mentioned alongside the National

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:12.040
Reconnaissance Program, especially in the context of this NSCID, not wanting to bring

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:18.200
undue attention to both of these programs. Now since NRO was created between the Navy and CIA

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:24.600
DSNT, you may think Navy Special Program refers to NRO. However, the Navy Special Program is itself

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.800
a very real office. Indeed, the Navy Special Program office serves as an umbrella control

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:35.000
system for several naval clandestine undersea operations. However, in this context and due

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.960
to the extreme secrecy of NRO to this day as highlighted by Inman, NRO could have certainly

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:45.960
been rolled under the NSP. To further this thesis, we can look back to an 11 December 1975

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:50.600
declassified memo for the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and others. Here we get a

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:56.440
keen look at the organizational structure of the Navy Special Program. The Navy Special Program was

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:01.800
once designated to run parallel to the National Reconnaissance Program or NRO under the Executive

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:06.040
Committee for the Director of Central Intelligence and the Assistant Secretary for Defense for

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:11.720
Intelligence. Someone really ought to ask Christopher Mellon about the Navy Special Program seen as he

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:18.120
himself served as former ASD slash I. The NSP, according to this memorandum, serves to act for

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:24.440
intelligence collection, similar to the NRO, DIA, or CIA. Having previously detailed the duties of

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:30.920
NRO, I do think this description means NRO is likely hidden within the NSP here, especially given the

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:36.680
timeframe 1975, where throughout our investigation we see NRO's activities really ramping up from

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:43.400
its creation in 1969 throughout the 70s. Therefore, with the Navy Special Program acting as an umbrella

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:49.800
office for numerous Navy clandestine operations, including possibly housing NRO, it is no stretch

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.760
to theorize a program that conducts undersea retrievals of anomalous craft alongside NRO

01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:00.200
that sends such vehicles to the Office of Naval Research locations, to then be studied by federal

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:06.280
elements and defense contractors would be hidden within the NSP. These operations would be compartmented

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.960
and rolled under the Navy Special Program Office. This process for naval UFO legacy programs would

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:18.280
likely remain the same today. After all, as of 26 May 2023, we can find requests for approval

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.920
for special access program facilities by the Navy Special Program central office.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:28.600
Naval legacy programs hidden within the NSP for extensive classification and compartmentalization

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.200
carry sound logic, especially when factoring in statements of former Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.840
Admiral Gallaudet has spoken on congressional record that whilst he is aware of testimony of

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:44.200
naval UFO legacy programs, he did not directly encounter them or was not briefed during his

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.040
prestigious position within the Navy. We can find one intriguing acknowledged CIA program that

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:56.680
likely utilized the Navy Special Program, Project Palladium and its director Samuel Jean Poteet.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:02.200
Poteet served at the NRO, CIA DS&T, as well as served as the technical director of the

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.960
Navy Special Program Office, where he provided naval reconnaissance systems expertise for the CIA

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:13.640
Directorate of Science and Technology. Poteet was a senior central intelligence agency scientific

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:19.160
intelligence officer, inventor, teacher, and association executive. He, quote, provided

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.040
scientific expertise on space and naval reconnaissance systems in the Directorate of Science and

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.320
Technology and served at the National Reconnaissance Office as technical director of the Navy Special

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:34.200
Program's office and as the executive director of the Intelligence Research and Development

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:40.120
Council, end quote. Under the CIA, Poteet spearheaded Project Palladium in the 1960s with

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:46.280
heavy use of naval assets, ships, and submarines. The project employed a variety of clandestine

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:52.200
submarines, radar reflectors, and jamming tactics to trick and gauge Soviet radar capabilities.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:58.360
Essentially, Palladium performed to fill Soviet radar systems with fake UAP signatures. Of course,

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.960
our true interest here lies with Palladium's usage of clandestine subs and Poteet's connection

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:09.080
to the Navy Special Program Office. According to excellent researcher Jeff Cruikshank,

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.760
references to Project Palladium can be found in the Majestic 12 documents. The TERS memo,

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:21.640
dated 28 June 1961, is a majestic document Ryan and Robert Wood have rated with a moderate to high

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.160
authenticity. This memo allegedly sees JFK, right to the Director of Central Intelligence,

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.000
Alan Doliz, in a national security memorandum with the subject, quote,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.920
review of MJ-12 intelligence operations as they relate to Cold War psychological warfare plans,

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:44.040
end quote. It is intriguing to see Alan Doliz did indeed meet with JFK twice, 28 June 1961.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.680
Cruikshank argues the psychological warfare plans referenced in the TERS memo directly

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.600
reference Operation Palladium. Although Palladium didn't get its iconic name until April 1962,

01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:00.360
when Dr. Albert Whelan took over as head of CIA, DS and T, the description of Palladium would appear

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:05.400
again in further majestic documents. And this is supported in the Medium Confidence Operation

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:12.440
Review, the MJ-12 project, allegedly written by Alan Doliz on 5 November 1961. This document

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:18.120
describes how the CIA was mapping the Soviet air defense system by using airborne electronic

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.160
countermeasure equipment and balloon decoys. Such a purpose was to provide a true picture of how

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.760
Soviet air defenses perceived UFOs. The memo discussed future similar psychological warfare

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:34.280
plans very similar to the TERS memo. Details of Project Palladium appearing in early MJ-12

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:40.200
documents dropped to Jamie Chandra in 1984 proved significant. Seen as according to an article

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:46.680
by Jean Petit in Stories of Intelligence Research, only six people knew about Palladium in the 1960s.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:52.040
Since Palladium was not declassified until long after 1984, this implies whoever wrote the

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:58.040
select majestic documents was well aware or a part of Project Palladium. As a matter of fact,

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:03.800
the first time Palladium would be discussed was within a classified manner in a 1998 CIA

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:10.200
journal written about by the aforementioned Jean Petit. Historically, the Navy special program saw

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:17.400
heavy compartmentalization and incredibly strict need to know access. In this 29 October 1974 CIA

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.600
memo titled Clearances Held by NSIC or National Security Council Intelligence Committee Working

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.240
Group Members, discussion was held around National Security Council Working Group programs

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:32.440
overlapping certain compartmented areas of the Navy special program. For read-on access,

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.800
clearance requests were required for a redacted name and National Security Council member and CIA

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:44.920
officer Richard Ober. This NSC memo was sent just a few days after the NRO memo from 1974 we

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:51.720
discussed earlier. We can additionally analyze a fascinating 14 December 1984 memo written to US

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:57.800
Navy Rear Admiral and Director of Naval Intelligence John Butts. The memo thanks John for his personal

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:03.400
sacrifices in arranging meetings in spite of a tooth injury. The writer from within the staff of the

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.960
director of the intelligence community additionally informed Butts they had received a letter from

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:13.080
the secretary of the Navy John Layman concerning the Navy special program. Remembered Layman

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.480
additionally served as director of NRO. This letter apparently took a month to get to the

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.360
desk of the director of central intelligence. The writer additionally suggested John Butts

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:27.160
include a representative from Everett Heinemann's department on the redacted special ad hoc

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:32.520
requirements committee. Remember, Heinemann was labeled by Inman as the CIA DS&T member

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.960
knowledgeable on UFO legacy operations. The work here on the Navy special program is just the

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:43.160
beginning for me and the ties to other subjects we have covered today is extremely interesting.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.920
After all, I have found and attempted to contact numerous former Navy special program personnel.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.720
These include a man who served for three years as a diver in the Navy special program with the

01:30:53.720 --> 01:31:00.440
mobile diving and salvage unit one. I have also contacted one Mr. P. R. who served for eight years

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:07.080
as project lead for Navy special program office and SOCOM acquisition program office. How interesting

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:13.000
this ties into the work of Chris Sharp regarding USO retrievals the Navy and SOCOM especially

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.520
intriguing seen as sharp implicated Lockheed Martin dry submersible as participating in USO

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:24.760
retrieval and since 2023 SOCOM has declared operational capability with Lockheed Martin dry

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:30.520
submersible. And finally, I have contacted one Mr. WH who served for two years as an

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.640
office of Naval intelligence chief information security officer for the Navy special program.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.120
And please understand, I am protecting the identity of these individuals as they very

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:50.760
well may wish to speak on the NSP. Believe it or not, today we have only scratched the surface

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:56.840
of naval UFO legacy programs. In the beginning of this project, I separated naval legacy programs

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:03.160
into four distinct categories monitor, collect, store and exploit. Of course, monitor has been

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:09.880
emitted from today's discussion as has majorly exploit has the Navy successfully created seafaring

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:15.880
ARV a deep sea equivalent to the flux liner. This of course will be another topic for another day.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.680
Today, we've investigated the Navy special program office and Office of Naval Research

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.720
conducting undersea UFO and USO crash retrievals alongside SOCOM private entity such as Lockheed

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:34.600
Martin and Woods Hole and intelligence organizations such as the NRO, NRO and CIA DS&T. We have also

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:40.600
discussed myriad senior naval officials such as Sumner Shapiro, Bobby Ray Inman and Nat Kobitz

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.960
who have all commented on the existence of crash retrieval and material exploitation programs.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:53.080
We have barely begun to dive in and discuss the FFRDC's Naval UARCs and DOD RDT&E facilities

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:58.920
that are highly likely involved with naval UFO legacy programs. Outside of mention of Lockheed,

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:05.480
Woods Hole and SAIC, we have barely even discussed contractors in UFO legacy operations. Outside of

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:10.040
sole source contracts, we have yet to really even dive into how legacy operations within the

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:15.800
Navy are funded. I have spoken before on witness Ed who claimed the existence of a joint UFO reverse

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:20.360
engineering program between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:25.720
After his service at Edwards, Ed would proceed to work at the Pentagon for the Air Force's RDT&E

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:31.480
panel chain where he would claim in two separate years 34 and 40 billion dollars disappeared to

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:36.360
non-authorized transfer of authority funds. Ed would additionally work as liaison between

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:42.120
the Pentagon and various defense contractors as an F-35 program subject matter expert.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.160
As a test director for an electronics warfare group dealing with reverse engineered UFOs out

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:53.240
of the Edwards 412th test group, I have theorized Ed's work on the F-35 also dealt with anomalous

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:58.840
technologies. This is no stretch as the F-35 program has historically carried an incredibly

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:05.000
bloated budget of two trillion dollars. Such bloated budgets with backdoor clandestine UFO

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.680
programs may have also occurred in the Navy and we may get a keen look at such an instance.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:16.440
In 1985, the U.S. Navy faced a massive controversy for an incredibly bizarre occurrence.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:22.360
Scandal arose when in 85 it was discovered the U.S. Navy had paid Grumman Aerospace Corporation

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:30.360
$660 apiece for ashtrays to be included in the E2C Hawkeye. The Navy only began to investigate

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:35.400
how many of these ashtrays had been bought and why they cost so much when an investigator for the

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:41.080
House Government Operations Committee discovered this egregious oversight. From this investigation,

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:46.360
it had also been determined the Navy was paying Grumman $400 per socket wrench that were used

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.920
to adjust the seats of F-14s and the Navy had also increased payments for ground locks from $102

01:34:52.920 --> 01:35:01.000
in 1982 to $2,710 a year later. Shockingly, this investigation would also reveal years prior the

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:08.760
Navy had been charging itself $954 for ashtrays. For such infractions, Defense Secretary Casper

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.360
Weinberger, who made some contested statements about Neuroabove, removed three officers prior

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:20.280
to any investigation, and Grumman aircraft wind that peace prices were so high due to needing

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:25.640
to make a small number of parts to spec. The damage had been done, leading to House Committee

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:31.000
investigators looking into larger naval contracts and discovered, for example, profits on aircraft

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:39.640
carrier contracts were in excess of $753 million or 29.7% and contractor profits on a single Trident

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:46.920
735 submarine were in excess of $96 million or 22%. Where was all this excess money on

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.720
contracts and parts going? I wager since we are discussing contractors such as Grumman,

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:57.080
which I have directly implicated in UFO legacy programs before its merger with Northrop. These

01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.760
funds were siphoned off legitimate contracts or parts to fund clandestine deep-sixed UFO

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:09.320
crash retrieval and material exploitation programs. So after all of this, today has mostly served as

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:15.080
an expose into naval legacy crash retrieval operations and necessary logistics. More and

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:21.480
more in my videos, I plan to speak on naval and special USO legacy programs. This is due to multiple

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:28.520
sources of mine informing me Navy USO programs are more secretive than even standard UFO legacy

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:34.840
operations. Hey guys, it's Gerb and thank you so very much for sticking through with me while we

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:42.920
took this dive into the US Navy and UFO and USO legacy program operations. Now as I said at the

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:49.560
very end of this video from multiple individuals that have worked in legacy programs to our tangentially

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:56.520
aware of them have informed me that the US Navy's programs are the most secretive there are. Why is

01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:02.040
this? Is it because the Navy deals with weapons technology as in the Randy Anderson case with

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:08.200
the gauntlet and the orb that supposedly experienced energetic discharge during recovery? Or is it

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:14.200
because the Navy specifically the ONR is a pristine stop for craft? Or is it because the

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:22.280
transmedium capabilities of UFO are the most coveted aspect of material exploitation and monitoring?

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.440
Or is it possibly because some of the secrecy stems from the possibility there are undersea UFO

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.960
bases and inherently if this is where some craft are stationed and departing from this implies

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:40.200
much secrecy? And that sort of makes a little sense as we've seen with Nuro underwater reconnaissance

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:44.360
underwater reconnaissance systems clandestine submarines are some of the United States most

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:52.120
highly regarded secrets. We have five major intelligence agencies the CIA, DIA, NSA, one of

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.160
my missing NRO and NGA and but Nuro is not on there and we've seen and proven today that Nuro

01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:03.080
does exist. So why is Nuro not listed? Nuro is really what kicked off my investigation into

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.720
this subject back in September with the work of Chris Sharp. When he detailed and changed the

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:14.840
article about undersea retrievals in the ONR, JSOC, SOCOM, Lockheed Martin Woods Hole and Nuro,

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.440
this really kicked off my interest. One of the most intriguing aspects of this project of course

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:26.840
was Bobby Ray Inman, a regular of this channel admitting that he was director of Nuro.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:32.600
And I'm really glad we got to explore a little bit more into Inman and his interactions with

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:39.320
Eschler and Bobby and sorry, excuse me, Everett or R. Evan Heineman as well as Sumner Shapiro.

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:45.560
Again, as I stated, I've received no contact back from Heineman and I've also tried to contact

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:50.680
Shapiro's family. They have not gotten back to me either. I would like to get statements from

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.840
some other people surrounding this case, but Nuro really kicked off this operation. And as

01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:01.720
we've seen with Nuro, as a black program agency, all of its operations have been shrouded in secrecy.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:08.280
Whether this entails usage of the Glomar Explorer, the Halibut, the NR Run, NR One, the Seawolf,

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:15.880
there is so much secrecy surrounding Nuro and that bridges really perfectly into the 1991

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:21.640
retrieval case under witness mark. Now, as I said in the video too, I'm still vetting this case.

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.760
I'm working with some individuals to try to identify mark to try to identify the naval

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:32.200
lieutenant commander and trying to track down those original sketches. I know Art Bell has passed

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.280
away and he was the point of contact for both of these. But I am trying to track that down.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:45.320
So mark story involves a DSRV or as I hypothesized from Craven and the work under the DSSP,

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:51.960
a DSSV, Deep Submergence Search Vehicle. I think those depth capabilities and mechanical arms

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:59.240
and rigging for retrieval of craft suit a DSSV more than a DSRV because DSRV was specifically

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:05.960
created for transfer of crew from a submarine where a DSSV was specifically tailored, never built,

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:11.560
to retrieve vehicles and to retrieve items. I did this fall under Project Sand Dollar.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.200
As we saw with Project Sand Dollar under Craven as well,

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.720
Sand Dollar involved items of interest on the sea floor of particular interest were radioactive

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:27.400
or nuclear emitting items. And as we see in Mark's case, the original side scan from vessels

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:32.520
and other vessels that picked up the signature of the craft, this was emitting some sort of

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.880
radiation to the point where the DSRV crew initially thought this to be a downed Korean or

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.200
Russian aircraft with some sort of nuclear technology. And it is interesting to see as

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:49.160
Mark said he steamed out of Virginia that the 2011 Fukushima documents detail that DSRV units

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.040
were ready and able in the east and west coast of the United States. So let's talk about that

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.080
incident a bit more because it's very rare we can ever find an undersea retrieval. The only

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.720
other example I can think of is Shag Harbor which occurred in 1967 and I would like to tackle that

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.760
case in the future, especially because there is testimony of the US Navy kind of coming in the

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:14.280
US Navy divers and coming in and really taking over the retrieval operation. But Mark's DSRV

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:20.120
crew observes a triangle. And as I said in the video, and as we talk about in this channel quite

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:27.080
often, I oftentimes attribute human origin to triangular craft, whether this be the TR-3B,

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:33.080
the XF-131 Super Sentinel, which I almost put more credence in than the TR-3B or other prototypes

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:38.920
that we discussed throughout the 80s and 90s in the TR-3B video. But this craft featured

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:47.240
hieroglyphic like writing alongside its outer edge, which, similar to Kecksburg and Danny

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:55.160
Sheehan's accounts, is not rare but not common in UFO crash retrieval incidents. The description

01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:02.200
of this craft is very similar to other NHI craft, no landing gear, no mechanical systems,

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:11.000
no cockpit, no glass, no windows, etc. What interests me is the aftermath of the retrieval.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.800
Mark states that after the marine archaeologist and four dives were able to observe the craft and

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:20.760
they were able to get it off the ground and retrieve it, that after a couple hours Mark

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:25.080
and his crew were steamed off site and were never warned not to speak about this incident,

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:30.040
warned not to talk about it or sign further NDAs. Now Mark inherently had to sign NDAs and

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.640
non-disclosure agreements for his work on DSRV, which as we know from John Pena Craven were sent

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.600
almost exclusively on clandestine operations, so it stands to reason there's a heavy amount

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:48.280
of secrecy when you sign on for this crew. But it almost appears as if the steamer of the LPH

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.680
vessel that discovered the craft in the DSRV was still trying to figure out what the heck they

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:57.320
had uncovered because it took a couple hours for Mark and his crew to be steamed off site

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:03.880
and they were never briefed on the incident, debriefed or discussed it further. I do hope Mark

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.160
is still alive and I would like to speak to him, I very much would. And then what is interesting

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:15.640
with Nuro as well as the connection to the 1973 Great Lakes Naval Station case, of course Stringfield

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:23.160
published on this back in the 80s, so the Glomar Explorer and its work with Nuro wasn't very well

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:28.680
known, if at all at this time, the Glomar Explorer had been known for Project Azorian retrieving one

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:38.680
third of the Soviet K-129 submarine, but just the connection of witness JK stating that the

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:45.720
San Diego sailor that he met that saw basically the same craft he saw had told him that it had been

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:51.880
shot down between Hawaii and the mainland by a destroyer and retrieved by the Glomar Explorer,

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:59.000
and this was early 1973. And then there's fascinating connections that Bobby Ray Inman

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.560
stated that in the early 70s, 72 to 74 to be exact, he became aware of the Glomar's activities out in

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:12.040
Hawaii. So there's a lot of really connective tissue here with these statements and I know

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:16.920
I say this in most videos, but our work with the Navy is really just beginning here. There are so

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:24.200
many more facilities we need to look at, so much more investigation into China Lake, because the

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:29.880
Navy and if Chris Sharpe's reporting is correct, the O&R specifically is almost a staging point for

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:35.560
housing craft. Now this makes me wonder, is this, does the Air Force, if they retrieve a craft or

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.680
the Army, if they retrieve a craft, do they initially stage at naval locations to then be

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:46.520
transported again? Does the Navy just satisfy naval UFO legacy programs for storage of craft,

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.800
or do they also operate alongside Army and Air Force? This would surprise me, as everything I

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:58.120
have been told, investigated and seen, is that Army, Air Force, and Navy almost act siloed,

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.160
very different programs, sometimes doing the same thing, but almost no communication to

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.000
adhere to the compartmentalization of these programs, where only the intelligence community

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.920
overlords really know what's going on between programs. So that would be really interesting

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:17.640
to track down. But anyways guys, if anybody watching this video has any experiences or

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:23.240
connections with individuals who have retrieved undersea craft or know of stories of undersea

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.360
craft retrieval, please contact me and I would love to speak to you. But let me know what you

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.400
content, that's not what I do. Only support what you think the channel is worth, and I
