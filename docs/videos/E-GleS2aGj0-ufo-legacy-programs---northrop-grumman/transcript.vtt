WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
The propulsion of these UFOs is unique,

00:04.600 --> 00:05.860
their ability to hover,

00:05.860 --> 00:08.960
their ability to accelerate very rapidly,

00:08.960 --> 00:12.400
their ability to move at very high speeds,

00:12.400 --> 00:15.160
very much higher than anything that we have achieved,

00:15.160 --> 00:17.180
even with our supersonic aircraft.

00:17.180 --> 00:20.420
All of these things, and particularly interestingly,

00:20.420 --> 00:22.520
without sonic booms and the things that we don't

00:22.520 --> 00:24.400
like about our supersonic aircraft,

00:24.400 --> 00:27.360
all of these things indicate a type of propulsion,

00:27.360 --> 00:28.640
which is unique.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.800
Different than anything we know anything about,

00:30.800 --> 00:32.560
and which would be a tremendous value

00:32.560 --> 00:34.960
if we could develop it and use it.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.520
That's the reason I feel with a number of others

00:37.520 --> 00:40.440
who have studied it, that it is a subject

00:40.440 --> 00:44.120
which deserves the highest type of scientific study

00:44.120 --> 00:45.400
and at an early date.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.320
The advantages to be gained are perfectly enormous.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.720
And how long do you feel it will be

00:49.720 --> 00:52.380
before we are flying in UFOs?

00:54.240 --> 00:56.440
Well, this probably is a $64 question

00:56.440 --> 00:58.360
without a question without.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.400
I think it depends, a great deal,

01:00.400 --> 01:03.120
on how rapidly we take them seriously

01:03.120 --> 01:06.280
and how soon we really set up

01:08.200 --> 01:11.000
a scientific study team to work on the subject.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.520
This is where we push the laws of physics.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.480
You see, the technology we make

01:18.480 --> 01:20.840
is what makes the impossible possible.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.880
And it doesn't stop there.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.440
So far on this channel,

01:28.440 --> 01:30.920
we have devoted entire investigations

01:30.920 --> 01:32.720
towards Battelle Memorial Institute

01:32.720 --> 01:35.200
and their possible work on shape memory alloys

01:35.200 --> 01:38.680
recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,

01:38.680 --> 01:40.200
as well as Lockheed Martin

01:40.200 --> 01:42.480
and their intimate decades long involvement

01:42.480 --> 01:44.720
in UFO legacy programs.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.640
After all, high profile US defense contractors

01:47.640 --> 01:50.880
have for decades been accused of actively engaging

01:50.880 --> 01:52.520
in material exploitation

01:52.520 --> 01:54.480
and reverse engineering programs,

01:54.480 --> 01:57.120
focused on technologies of unknown origin

01:57.120 --> 01:59.080
in conjunction with various factions

01:59.080 --> 02:02.440
within US government intelligence and military.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.480
Overall, you know, the government

02:04.480 --> 02:06.920
has been the custodian of a lot of this, right?

02:06.920 --> 02:08.720
And they'll hand recede it out

02:08.720 --> 02:12.520
to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,

02:12.520 --> 02:15.480
which I find highly unethical.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.600
You have basically a sole source arrangement

02:17.600 --> 02:21.600
and you allow certain private corporate elements

02:21.640 --> 02:24.680
to look at this, develop a potential insight

02:24.680 --> 02:26.880
and then sell it back to the government for profit.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.000
And I think that's totally unethical.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.120
Lockheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work,

02:32.120 --> 02:36.760
both in our atmosphere, in space, and even underwater.

02:36.760 --> 02:41.760
There are certain efforts to...

02:42.360 --> 02:43.800
It's a tough question you ask.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.560
I left the Air Force and was sent out to California

02:46.560 --> 02:50.760
at that time to begin establishing my cover basis

02:50.760 --> 02:54.120
as an independent contractor

02:54.120 --> 02:57.640
so that I can serve what was coming down the line next for me.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.640
And that is the path which led to the UAP subject.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.240
These claims are not without merit

03:05.240 --> 03:06.320
as since the inception

03:06.320 --> 03:08.520
of the US military industrial complex,

03:08.520 --> 03:11.080
private defense industry has worked in tandem

03:11.080 --> 03:12.920
with military and intelligence

03:12.920 --> 03:15.080
to bolster US military might

03:15.080 --> 03:19.720
protected by waived, unacknowledged special access programs.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.200
I have directly accused Lockheed Martin,

03:22.200 --> 03:26.560
Patel, Boeing, SAIC, and many other private institutions

03:26.560 --> 03:28.560
and semi-private institutions,

03:28.560 --> 03:32.720
such as UARCs and FFRDCs possessing, experimenting with

03:32.720 --> 03:35.120
and possibly successfully harnessing

03:35.120 --> 03:37.240
non-human technologies.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.720
Today, we focus our sights towards the US Aerospace

03:40.720 --> 03:45.200
and Defense Colossus and father of the B-2 stealth bomber,

03:45.200 --> 03:48.080
Northrop Grumman, often overshadowed

03:48.080 --> 03:49.600
by the infamy of Lockheed

03:49.600 --> 03:52.200
and their involvement in the 2008 failed attempt

03:52.200 --> 03:56.120
to divest recovered NHI materials to the OSAP program.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.600
Northrop Grumman has largely successfully distanced itself

03:59.600 --> 04:01.800
from the spotlight of defense contractors

04:01.800 --> 04:04.680
engaging with UAP legacy programs.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.320
In fact, focused discussion

04:06.320 --> 04:08.800
on the alien reproduction vehicle, Fluxliner,

04:08.800 --> 04:10.440
as relayed by Brad Sorensen

04:10.440 --> 04:13.080
and the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle

04:13.080 --> 04:16.120
discussed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

04:16.160 --> 04:18.440
seemed to primarily focus on Lockheed.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.920
These testimonies highlight the defense contractor

04:20.920 --> 04:23.640
successfully reverse engineering non-human craft

04:23.640 --> 04:25.600
to operate under human control.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.360
But throughout such disclosures,

04:27.360 --> 04:30.120
Lockheed isn't the sole contractor accused

04:30.120 --> 04:32.360
of such highly classified efforts.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.640
Hardly mentioned, but always alongside in the shadows

04:35.640 --> 04:37.200
is Northrop Grumman.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.600
Could Northrop Grumman truly be involved

04:39.600 --> 04:42.040
in material exploitation of technologies

04:42.040 --> 04:44.460
of unknown origin, TUOs?

04:44.460 --> 04:48.340
Just how far does their involvement with UFO studies go?

04:48.340 --> 04:52.340
Join me today as we peer into the shadows to find out.

04:52.340 --> 04:53.900
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb

04:53.900 --> 04:55.660
and thank you so much for joining me

04:55.660 --> 04:58.660
as we touch back to UFOs in the private sector.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.580
This time to Northrop Grumman.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.300
The contractor I believe alongside Lockheed

05:03.300 --> 05:05.940
is the Paramount Aerospace Corporation

05:05.940 --> 05:08.860
entrenched in UFO legacy programs.

05:08.860 --> 05:11.260
From whistleblower testimony to analysis

05:11.260 --> 05:14.220
of Northrop's numerous acquisitions over the decades,

05:14.220 --> 05:17.300
let's thoroughly dive into the legendary Northrop Grumman

05:17.300 --> 05:20.700
and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.260
Let's start by analyzing the history of Northrop

05:28.260 --> 05:32.540
and its many, many, many acquisitions over the decades.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.940
Northrop Grumman is an American aerospace

05:34.940 --> 05:39.060
and defense company employing over 95,000 employees

05:39.060 --> 05:42.020
with an annual revenue of $30 billion.

05:42.020 --> 05:45.340
The industry giant has achieved extraordinary engineering

05:45.340 --> 05:47.180
feat such as aiding in the development

05:47.180 --> 05:49.060
of the James Webb Space Telescope

05:49.060 --> 05:53.660
and directly creating the B-2 Spirit Bomber and B-21 Raider,

05:53.660 --> 05:56.340
the world's only known stealth bombers.

05:56.340 --> 05:59.260
Northrop Grumman operates in four major divisions,

05:59.260 --> 06:02.300
aeronautics, defense, space and mission systems,

06:02.300 --> 06:03.900
outside of military aircraft,

06:03.900 --> 06:06.020
space systems and weapon development.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.500
Northrop also engages in cyber security,

06:08.500 --> 06:12.100
information technology and radar and sensor systems.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.780
Briefly, I do take an extreme interest

06:14.780 --> 06:18.220
in Northrop's C-4 ISR, Command Control,

06:18.220 --> 06:20.540
Communications, Computers, Intelligence,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.460
Surveillance and Reconnaissance,

06:22.460 --> 06:24.540
which falls under Northrop's land-based

06:24.540 --> 06:26.300
critical technology services,

06:26.300 --> 06:28.180
sustainment and modernization.

06:28.180 --> 06:32.060
C-4 ISR is essentially the military's nervous system

06:32.060 --> 06:35.620
consisting of various electronic equipment and technologies

06:35.620 --> 06:37.500
serving to aid the modern warfighter

06:37.500 --> 06:39.380
through data and intelligence.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.220
I am currently working on a thesis

06:41.220 --> 06:44.420
that select contractor C-4 ISR programs

06:44.420 --> 06:48.260
engage in deep-six waved USAPs for crash retrieval

06:48.260 --> 06:52.300
and ARV testing, data and analysis, let me explain.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.740
Northrop was one of the premier contractors

06:54.740 --> 06:58.340
operating C-4 ISR for the Strategic Defense Initiative

06:58.340 --> 07:01.100
instituted under Reagan in 1983.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.340
Northrop created the first laser radar

07:03.340 --> 07:05.220
used in space for SDI.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.900
I have discussed numerous times lines of research

07:07.900 --> 07:12.460
which state SDI focused on Soviet ICBM nuclear defense,

07:12.460 --> 07:15.500
secretly studied and employed offensive capabilities

07:15.500 --> 07:18.780
against UAP and siphoned program funds

07:18.780 --> 07:21.620
to UAP legacy programs such as the DARS,

07:21.620 --> 07:23.420
Defense Advanced Research Center,

07:23.420 --> 07:26.100
proposed to exist in an ARPA document.

07:26.100 --> 07:29.700
SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation,

07:29.700 --> 07:32.820
frequently secures massive hundreds of million dollar

07:32.860 --> 07:34.980
contracts for C-4 ISR

07:34.980 --> 07:37.700
at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.860
I have published extensive research,

07:39.860 --> 07:42.980
SAIC runs an off-world technologies division

07:42.980 --> 07:47.100
to house recovered NHI artifacts at the Crane Naval location.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.580
When discussing witness Ed in the existence

07:49.580 --> 07:51.660
of a joint ARV testing program

07:51.660 --> 07:54.180
out of Edwards Air Force Base in Area 51

07:54.180 --> 07:56.140
under the Edwards 412 test group,

07:56.140 --> 07:59.980
I made reference to a Lockheed Martin ISR case study.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.780
In this study, Lockheed was tasked

08:01.820 --> 08:04.740
with updating the system used by USAF Warfare Center

08:04.740 --> 08:07.540
for Intelligence Collection and Data Processing.

08:07.540 --> 08:10.820
Lockheed reconfigured a two phase security classification

08:10.820 --> 08:14.700
system used by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.300
Yes, the same agency Grush was a part of

08:17.300 --> 08:19.700
when liaison to the UAP task force

08:19.700 --> 08:21.860
and the same agency recently mentioned

08:21.860 --> 08:24.220
by respected journalist Chris Sharp

08:24.220 --> 08:28.060
as participating in undersea UAP crash retrievals.

08:28.060 --> 08:30.500
The system was implemented to the combined air

08:30.540 --> 08:33.420
and space operation center at Nellis Air Force Base,

08:33.420 --> 08:35.620
which is tasked with processing information

08:35.620 --> 08:38.500
for exploitation of time sensitive targets.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.100
At the time I speculated,

08:40.100 --> 08:42.740
although this Lockheed project arose from challenges

08:42.740 --> 08:46.700
in the Nellis Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training Exercise,

08:46.700 --> 08:49.780
could such systems be used to monitor UAP

08:49.780 --> 08:51.860
and UAP crash retrievals?

08:51.860 --> 08:54.060
Although C4 ISR is common

08:54.060 --> 08:56.020
and the nervous system of the armed forces,

08:56.020 --> 08:58.660
I do think analyzing Defense Corporation's

08:58.700 --> 09:02.980
C4 ISR contracts and projects with USAF Army

09:02.980 --> 09:05.220
and Navy can lead to knocking on the door

09:05.220 --> 09:07.780
of UAP program operations.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.140
And after that long discussion,

09:09.140 --> 09:11.860
finally back to the history of Northrop Grumman.

09:11.860 --> 09:15.500
NG arose from the merging of two military aircraft companies,

09:15.500 --> 09:17.500
the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Company

09:17.500 --> 09:20.100
and the Northrop Company in 1994.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.780
Throughout its storied history,

09:21.780 --> 09:24.260
Northrop made a few very key acquisitions.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.700
We will continue to reference over and over

09:27.260 --> 09:28.660
again throughout this project.

09:28.660 --> 09:31.780
One such acquisition occurred in 1999

09:31.780 --> 09:34.060
with procurement of Teledyne Ryan,

09:34.060 --> 09:37.260
developer of surveillance systems at unmanned aircraft.

09:37.260 --> 09:41.060
In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc,

09:41.060 --> 09:43.940
a corporation involved in aerospace, electronics

09:43.940 --> 09:45.980
and the automotive industries.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.380
Outside of computers, systems engineering,

09:48.380 --> 09:51.780
integrated circuits, TRW was a true trailblazer

09:51.780 --> 09:53.300
in spacecraft construction,

09:53.340 --> 09:56.020
building pioneer one, 10 and numerous

09:56.020 --> 09:57.740
space-based observatories.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.980
The defense giant considered TRW,

09:59.980 --> 10:02.340
its quote unquote capstone acquisition

10:02.340 --> 10:04.260
signaling the end to Northrop Grumman's

10:04.260 --> 10:06.220
aggressive purchasing streak.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.780
Why was TRW considered the crown jewel

10:08.780 --> 10:10.100
of Northrop's purchases?

10:10.100 --> 10:11.820
While there is evidence to suggest

10:11.820 --> 10:14.580
this was due to TRW operating a portfolio

10:14.580 --> 10:17.620
of UAP legacy programs upon purchase.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.780
Lengthy investigation must be done

10:19.780 --> 10:22.260
to discover the UFO program portfolio

10:22.260 --> 10:25.020
Northrop may have inherited from TRW.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.220
TRW has long been associated

10:27.220 --> 10:29.100
with a rumored crash retrieval program

10:29.100 --> 10:31.220
run out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,

10:31.220 --> 10:33.660
a topic even touched on by Lou Elizondo

10:33.660 --> 10:35.180
in his book Eminent.

10:35.180 --> 10:37.780
And let's mention that in June of 1960,

10:37.780 --> 10:40.820
TRW spawned the Aerospace Corporation.

10:40.820 --> 10:43.220
The Aerospace Corporation has additionally

10:43.220 --> 10:45.820
been implicated in UFO legacy programs

10:45.820 --> 10:47.740
and served as a place for employment

10:47.740 --> 10:49.580
for OSAP physicist and member

10:49.580 --> 10:52.740
of the Wilson Davis meeting Dr. Eric Davis.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.740
I would additionally like to draw attention

10:54.740 --> 10:58.660
to the year the Aerospace Corporation was founded in 1960

10:58.660 --> 11:00.740
and relate this founding to the testimony

11:00.740 --> 11:03.540
of Lieutenant Colonel Philip J. Corso.

11:03.540 --> 11:07.220
Corso stated 1958 to 1962 oversaw

11:07.220 --> 11:09.580
the golden age of U.S. Army R&D

11:09.580 --> 11:12.260
where Army assets, universities, laboratories,

11:12.260 --> 11:13.980
and private industry were leveraged

11:13.980 --> 11:16.420
to reverse engineer non-human technology

11:16.420 --> 11:18.540
to bolster the U.S. war machine.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.980
Analyzing Army primers from around this time

11:20.980 --> 11:23.580
highlight a period of massive innovation

11:23.580 --> 11:25.580
in Army research and development.

11:25.580 --> 11:29.620
The MITRE Corporation was born during this time in 1959

11:29.620 --> 11:32.220
with lines of research to suggest its formation

11:32.220 --> 11:35.060
was to engage in such research and development projects

11:35.060 --> 11:38.580
alongside Bell Labs, Sperry Rand, et cetera.

11:38.580 --> 11:42.020
The Aerospace Corporation founded just one year post-MITRE,

11:42.020 --> 11:45.580
maybe one additional corporation spawned from TRW

11:45.580 --> 11:48.260
for U.S. Army legacy operations.

11:48.260 --> 11:51.780
And worthy to note, both MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation

11:51.780 --> 11:54.900
are both known as FFRDCs,

11:54.900 --> 11:57.780
federally funded research and development centers.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.460
Present day, the Aerospace Corporation manages

12:00.460 --> 12:03.620
the Aerospace FFRDC for the Department of Defense

12:03.620 --> 12:05.340
and Air Force to support, quote,

12:05.340 --> 12:09.140
national security space programs, end quote.

12:09.140 --> 12:12.220
We are truly the only space enterprise

12:12.220 --> 12:14.380
that exists in the United States.

12:14.380 --> 12:17.060
And I mean this at the agency level in the government,

12:17.060 --> 12:19.820
the FFRDCs in private industry.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.660
There is no other organization

12:21.660 --> 12:25.060
that does national security space, civil and commercial,

12:25.060 --> 12:26.700
and international as well,

12:26.700 --> 12:28.620
that ties these all together with both the breadth

12:28.620 --> 12:30.260
and the depth that we bring to this problem.

12:30.260 --> 12:33.460
I have spoken at length about FFRDCs,

12:33.460 --> 12:35.100
semi-private institutions

12:35.100 --> 12:38.620
that play a crucial hand in UAP legacy programs.

12:38.620 --> 12:41.540
I recommend any of my previous four investigations

12:41.540 --> 12:43.260
to hear more on the subject.

12:43.260 --> 12:46.620
It is intriguing, Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo,

12:46.620 --> 12:48.940
all but admitted the Aerospace Corporation

12:48.940 --> 12:51.460
built from TRW is actively involved

12:51.460 --> 12:53.860
in UAP legacy programs.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.060
And that up to that point,

12:55.060 --> 12:59.780
TRW had been a primary contractor in such UFO programs.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.700
So all this talk about private contractors,

13:01.700 --> 13:02.700
you know, the big Lockheed Martin,

13:02.700 --> 13:05.420
what about federally funded research and development centers,

13:05.420 --> 13:09.220
such as MITRE, RAND, TRIAD, Oak Ridge, and UARC,

13:09.220 --> 13:10.820
so university affiliated research centers,

13:10.820 --> 13:13.100
where do they fall into this?

13:13.100 --> 13:14.620
Only one, and I won't name it.

13:15.620 --> 13:20.100
It started out as a contractor in 1960,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.380
starting not too long after it was born.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.860
It was actually a spinoff of TRW.

13:24.860 --> 13:28.140
So TRW was the principal investigator for the first

13:29.660 --> 13:34.420
roughly what, almost 30, yeah, practically, well, 29 years.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.740
Before we keep discussing TRW,

13:36.740 --> 13:40.420
let's highlight a former U.S. Premier Electronics Manufacturer

13:40.420 --> 13:42.980
implicated in TUO exploitation

13:42.980 --> 13:46.460
by Lieutenant Colonel Corsa with possible ties to MITRE

13:46.460 --> 13:48.500
and the Aerospace Corporation,

13:48.500 --> 13:51.260
this being the company I just mentioned above,

13:51.260 --> 13:53.420
the Sparey RAND Corporation.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.500
In his manuscript, Corsa would reference

13:55.500 --> 13:58.700
the personal memoirs of Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau,

13:58.700 --> 14:00.460
Chief of U.S. Army R&D

14:00.460 --> 14:03.660
and Founder of the Army's Foreign Technology Division,

14:03.660 --> 14:06.060
and how Trudeau would engage in frequent meetings

14:06.060 --> 14:07.500
with Sparey RAND's board,

14:07.500 --> 14:10.620
including legendary General Douglas MacArthur.

14:10.620 --> 14:13.260
Sparey RAND went defunct in 1986

14:13.260 --> 14:16.140
and its former divisions became part of Lockheed Martin,

14:16.140 --> 14:19.780
Raytheon, Honeywell, and you guessed it, Northrop Grumman,

14:19.780 --> 14:23.780
all companies implicated in UFO legacy programs.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.980
But let's get back to TRW.

14:25.980 --> 14:29.300
TRW features some familiar faces of this channel

14:29.300 --> 14:31.380
many will recognize.

14:31.380 --> 14:34.100
Remember if you will, Dr. Eric Walker,

14:34.100 --> 14:37.540
the scientist named by physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher

14:37.580 --> 14:40.460
as participating in UFO crash retrieval meetings

14:40.460 --> 14:44.020
alongside Vannefar Bush in the 1950s.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.700
Walker started Penn State's

14:45.700 --> 14:47.780
University Affiliated Research Center,

14:47.780 --> 14:50.420
self-admitted he knew about the Majestic 12

14:50.420 --> 14:55.300
and was present at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.380
I have always talked about how Walker

14:57.380 --> 15:00.780
is one of the most crucial names in UFO crash retrieval

15:00.780 --> 15:04.980
and reverse engineering programs in the 1950s and 1960s.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.980
Much intrigues me about Walker,

15:06.980 --> 15:11.060
including his position as former chairman of TRW.

15:11.060 --> 15:14.180
TRW has also been discussed at length

15:14.180 --> 15:16.980
by respected researchers such as Richard Dolan

15:16.980 --> 15:20.260
as the primary contractor running a crash retrieval program

15:20.260 --> 15:22.580
under the project named Zodiac.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.260
Project Zodiac, an MJ-12-like entity,

15:25.260 --> 15:26.820
is not our subject today.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.660
However, we may discuss it soon

15:28.660 --> 15:31.740
as the story of Zodiac by pseudonym Sedge Masters

15:31.740 --> 15:33.940
is utterly captivating.

15:33.940 --> 15:37.220
And with TRW, we may just have a paper trail

15:37.220 --> 15:41.020
to connect them and Northrop to legacy operations.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.820
In 2004, former assistant secretary

15:43.820 --> 15:45.500
of housing and urban development,

15:45.500 --> 15:48.380
Catherine Austin Fitz, wrote a paper called

15:48.380 --> 15:51.220
The Black Budget of the United States.

15:51.220 --> 15:54.620
This paper stated a large portion of the nation's wealth

15:54.620 --> 15:57.020
had ongoing leave and illegally diverted

15:57.020 --> 15:59.140
into secret, unaccountable channels

15:59.140 --> 16:03.100
to support clandestine military research and development.

16:03.100 --> 16:06.300
Some to a majority of which had been suggested

16:06.300 --> 16:08.340
to be UAP-related.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.780
While at the HUD department,

16:09.780 --> 16:11.420
Fitz came across information

16:11.420 --> 16:14.940
various high-profile defense contractors accounting systems

16:14.940 --> 16:17.540
were responsible for scrubbing and obfuscating

16:17.540 --> 16:19.740
the direction of these funds.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.660
Although a 1990 federal law mandated

16:22.660 --> 16:25.620
every single U.S. government agency be audited,

16:25.620 --> 16:28.900
the Pentagon never publicly faced a comprehensive audit

16:28.900 --> 16:32.680
until one was launched in December of 2017.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.280
And not to mention since,

16:34.280 --> 16:37.000
the Pentagon has never passed an audit.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.480
And this 2017 audit may have happened solely due

16:40.480 --> 16:43.560
to another Catherine Austin Fitz University paper

16:43.560 --> 16:48.560
detailing $21 trillion in unauthorized spending

16:48.560 --> 16:51.080
in the DOD and Department of Housing

16:51.080 --> 16:54.920
and Urban Development from 1998 to 2015.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.440
In the Wilson Davis memo,

16:56.440 --> 16:58.660
which I have talked about so many times,

16:58.660 --> 17:01.800
Admiral Thomas Wilson relates to Dr. Eric Davis,

17:01.840 --> 17:02.920
the watch committee,

17:02.920 --> 17:06.520
the gatekeepers of the UAP legacy program portfolio,

17:06.520 --> 17:09.160
told Wilson they are organized after an audit

17:09.160 --> 17:12.360
in the 1990s almost blew their cover.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.120
What this means is essentially a failed audit

17:15.120 --> 17:17.800
led to UAP programs being reorganized

17:17.800 --> 17:20.760
under the special access program oversight committee,

17:20.760 --> 17:22.600
senior review group.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.240
Here is where we circle back.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.440
In 2003, Northrop Grumman settled a lawsuit

17:27.440 --> 17:31.400
from the U.S. government for $111 million,

17:31.400 --> 17:34.400
almost $200 million today.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.440
This settlement was due to Northrop subsidiary TRW,

17:38.440 --> 17:42.200
overcharging for government work done on space projects

17:42.200 --> 17:44.840
in the early 1990s.

17:44.840 --> 17:49.120
This suggests TRW's inflated space project contracts

17:49.120 --> 17:51.920
were implicated and uncovered in the failed audit

17:51.920 --> 17:53.880
mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo

17:53.880 --> 17:56.640
that took place in the 1990s.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.560
Timelines indeed match up as the beginning roots

17:59.600 --> 18:03.480
of this lawsuit can be traced back to 1994.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.840
TRW's likely involvement with UAP legacy

18:06.840 --> 18:09.640
waived unacknowledged special access programs

18:09.640 --> 18:11.760
appeared as contract overcharging

18:11.760 --> 18:14.680
to the wider DOD auditing officials,

18:14.680 --> 18:17.160
leading to the lawsuit against TRW

18:17.160 --> 18:20.200
settled by Northrop, utterly fascinating.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.280
If this hypothesis is accurate,

18:22.280 --> 18:26.040
Northrop settled the suit and reorganized their UAP portfolio

18:26.040 --> 18:29.640
under the SAPOX Senior Review Group program reorganization

18:29.640 --> 18:31.440
that was relayed to Wilson.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.000
To make Northrop's purchase of TRW even more interesting,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.360
shortly before Northrop bought TRW in 2002,

18:38.360 --> 18:43.360
TRW had purchased BDM, Braddock Dunn and McDonald in 1997.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.200
BDM was a technical services firm

18:46.200 --> 18:48.320
that headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas,

18:48.320 --> 18:50.360
White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico,

18:50.360 --> 18:52.840
and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.520
BDM specialized in and worked primarily

18:55.520 --> 18:58.040
with missile guidance, application optics,

18:58.040 --> 19:01.640
electronic instrumentation, and radiation physics.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.760
BDM was also founded in 1959,

19:04.760 --> 19:08.560
around the same time as MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.240
BDM was mentioned specifically by Commander Will Miller

19:12.240 --> 19:15.360
of the Wilson Davis Memo in the year 2000.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.280
The former U.S. Navy commander

19:17.280 --> 19:19.440
stated numerous government individuals

19:19.440 --> 19:22.040
such as Defense Intelligence Agency directors

19:22.040 --> 19:24.920
who in this case would have been Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson

19:24.960 --> 19:27.360
were isolated from UAP knowledge.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.520
The quote-unquote keepers of the secrets

19:29.520 --> 19:33.120
resided in DOD middle management and civilian contractors

19:33.120 --> 19:36.360
like Boeing, Lockheed, and BDM.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.720
To learn more about Miller

19:37.720 --> 19:39.360
and why his words carry weight,

19:39.360 --> 19:41.320
I highly recommend watching my video

19:41.320 --> 19:42.680
on the Wilson Davis Memo.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.480
Sure, it's my first video and it's very amateurish,

19:45.480 --> 19:47.760
but there's still some good information there.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.760
BDM could warrant its own video,

19:49.760 --> 19:52.240
but for now, I leave you with this.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.720
Just like FFRDCs, I have talked ad nauseam

19:55.720 --> 19:57.920
of Major General Albert Stubblebine

19:57.920 --> 20:00.840
and how his department, U.S. Army INSCOM

20:00.840 --> 20:02.640
and their previous Special Forces Unit,

20:02.640 --> 20:04.560
the Intelligence Support Activity,

20:04.560 --> 20:08.320
have been historically involved with UAP crash retrieval.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.800
In 1984, Stubblebine was replaced as head of INSCOM

20:11.800 --> 20:15.520
and went on to serve as vice president for BDM.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.960
The following year in 1985,

20:17.960 --> 20:21.320
BDM would host an advanced theoretical physics conference

20:21.320 --> 20:25.360
to discuss UFO reverse engineering opportunities.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.280
And actually, let's not stop there with BDM.

20:28.280 --> 20:31.600
In 1989, NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler

20:31.600 --> 20:34.880
was introduced to retired rear admiral Sumner Shapiro

20:34.880 --> 20:36.600
from Bobby Ray Inman.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.440
Inman was then board member of SAIC and Wackenhut

20:40.440 --> 20:44.180
and former NSA director and CIA deputy director.

20:44.180 --> 20:47.480
I have reason to believe Inman engaged with UAP programs

20:47.480 --> 20:49.040
in each of these four positions,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.080
but that is not our topic for today.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.840
Shapiro told Eschler factions within the U.S.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
possess extraterrestrial vehicles

20:55.840 --> 20:58.960
and that he had even studied one at close quarters.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.200
According to Shapiro, teams would take apart craft,

21:02.200 --> 21:04.600
pack them up and ship them across the country

21:04.600 --> 21:06.200
to different locations.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.280
These craft featured unique interlocking components

21:09.280 --> 21:12.000
that had to be dissembled in an exact sequence

21:12.000 --> 21:13.640
to be put back together.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.000
Rear admiral Shapiro was not only

21:16.000 --> 21:18.080
former director of naval intelligence,

21:18.080 --> 21:23.080
but also BDM international board member at the time, 1989.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.740
To this day, Northrop Grumman maintains

21:25.740 --> 21:28.200
a major corporate presence in Tyson Corner

21:28.200 --> 21:30.720
near the former BDM headquarters.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.880
All of this commentary on TRW, Teledyne Ryan,

21:33.880 --> 21:35.840
which we will get to shortly in BDM,

21:35.840 --> 21:37.680
served to highlight how Northrop Grumman

21:37.680 --> 21:41.160
and its many acquisitions interweave intimately

21:41.160 --> 21:44.100
with numerous cases we have covered on this channel.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.840
If the claims of Philip J. Corso are indeed true,

21:46.840 --> 21:49.480
Northrop's modern day legacy program operations

21:49.480 --> 21:52.320
can likely trace its roots back to the US Army's

21:52.320 --> 21:56.800
golden age of research and development in 1958 to 1962.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.240
This would also mean many of Northrop Corporation

21:59.240 --> 22:00.900
and Northrop Grumman's acquisitions

22:00.900 --> 22:03.040
were to purchase companies that had active,

22:03.040 --> 22:06.080
ongoing UFO legacy programs.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.760
This sort of context is crucial to establish

22:08.760 --> 22:10.880
before we explore whistleblower claims

22:10.880 --> 22:13.920
of Northrop's operations in these programs.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.800
And last thing before we continue,

22:15.800 --> 22:18.940
many individuals think of Lockheed Skunkworks Division

22:18.940 --> 22:21.160
when they picture UFO reverse engineering

22:21.160 --> 22:24.400
and material exploitation programs in the private sector.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.600
Well, in 1992, Northrop created its own

22:27.600 --> 22:30.120
quote unquote answer to Skunkworks.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.080
Northrop created the NATDC,

22:33.080 --> 22:35.840
Northrop Advanced Technology and Design Center

22:35.840 --> 22:40.080
to focus on the company's core key defense programs.

22:40.680 --> 22:45.680
While we have already discussed many of NG's acquisitions

22:46.080 --> 22:48.080
and their ties to UFO legacy programs

22:48.080 --> 22:50.600
from the 1960s to 1990s,

22:50.600 --> 22:52.600
let's back up and trace mentions

22:52.600 --> 22:55.080
and claims surrounding specifically

22:55.080 --> 22:58.280
the Northrop Corporation and later Northrop Grumman.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.040
I often think back to the words of US Army Colonel

23:01.040 --> 23:04.520
and advisor to US Army Futures Command, Carl Nell,

23:04.520 --> 23:05.520
who once stated,

23:06.120 --> 23:08.000
Non-human intelligence exists.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.080
Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.200
This interaction is not new and it's been ongoing.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.040
And there are unelected people in the government

23:18.040 --> 23:19.760
that are aware of that.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.200
And so, Carl, that is quite a bold statement.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
I'm wondering and I'm curious,

23:27.200 --> 23:30.600
how confident are you that that is true?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.000
There's zero doubt.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Nell has served as an outspoken advocate for David Grush

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
and the existence of technologies of unknown origin.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
One has to wonder if this absence of doubt

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
arose from Nell's position as Deputy CTO

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
and Director of Systems Engineering and Integration

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
for 13 years on Northrop Grumman.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
After all, while serving as Northrop's Deputy CTO,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Nell was additionally serving as Command Representative

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
to US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Service,

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Material Program.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Northrop's earliest contributions to legacy programs

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
may trace back to 1968.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
MS Can and GM Andrew of Northrop Northair

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
published a paper on the electro aerodynamics

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
in supersonic flow, suggesting Northrop was researching

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
methods to reduce drag of an aircraft

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
by creating an electrostatic field around the craft.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
This may remind some of T. Townsend-Brown and electro-gravidics.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
In Nick Cook's excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
one Dan Marcus is mentioned, a pseudonym for a source

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
in the British aerospace industry.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Marcus relayed to Cook that in 2002,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
the Pentagon pulled the specific paper and, quote,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
made it disappear, end quote.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Marcus would suggest the B-2 Spirit Bomber

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
applied these concepts to employ an electrostatic field

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
around the aircraft to reduce drag.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
In fact, some UFO researchers such as Michael Schrap

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
and Dr. Richard Boylan take this a step further,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
suggesting the B-2 employs reverse engineered

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
possibly electro-gravidic technology,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
leading to the massive cost of the systems.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
The question is, and Mark talked about this before,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Aviation Week Space Technology, March 9, 1992,

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
had a very interesting article from people

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
who worked at Northrop who were very upset

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
that the technology associated with the B-2 program

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
was not being trickled down to the public industry.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
That's what you see in this diagram right here.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
And then negatively charges the exhaust gases

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
to reduce the infrared signature.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
This is the same type of electro-gravidic technology

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
So this technology might date back a lot earlier

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
than we originally thought.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
The first true mention of Northrop engaging with NHI technology

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
comes from the work of UFO researcher William Hamilton.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Hamilton's book, Cosmic Top Secret,

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
is in my opinion the most underappreciated book

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
in all of ufology.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
It is a truly excellent piece, decades ahead of its time.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
For example, the 1992 book makes the first recorded mention

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
of the term ARV and discussion of the Fluxliner,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
which wouldn't rise to fame until Stephen Greer's

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
2001 disclosure project event.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Mind you, Hamilton did misquote the ARV acronym

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
stating Alien Replicated Vehicle instead of Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
However, my research has shown Hamilton spoke to Bill Scott

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
of Aviation Week in Space Technology

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
to discuss the Brad Sorenson Fluxliner testimony

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
in the early 90s.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
The next time someone tries to say Stephen Greer

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
coined the term ARV, send them this passage.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
And Hamilton actually told Greer about the 1988

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Norton Air Force Base Show Fluxliner incident

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
and actually passed along both primary witness Sorenson

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
and aerospace illustrator McCandlish to Greer.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Hamilton was one of the first to draw serious research

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
to the Antelope Valley, California, near Edwards Air Force Base.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Hamilton drew attention to Lockheed's Gunkworks, Rockwell,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
McDonnell Douglas, and Northrop, all having plants

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
in Palmdale, California.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
The nation's then chief center of aerospace technology

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
in the middle of these complexes sat Air Force Plant 42,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
a name many associate with UAP programs.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
The author of Cosmic Top Secret does not draw attention

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
to the Northrop facility near Palmdale,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
but instead to a secret underground installation

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
north in the Tujachepe Mountains.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Hamilton accuses the Northrop-Tahan Ranch Radar Cross-Section Facility

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
and accompanying underground installation as a UAP program facility.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Very little is known about this facility and the underground extension,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
but let's see what we can dig up.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
This site officially serves as a radar cross-section range.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Quickly, what exactly is a radar cross-section facility?

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
to test aircraft radar signatures.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
The sites utilize large runways and pylons

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
raised from underground on concrete diamonds

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Many RCS facilities saw construction during the Cold War.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
This led the majority of installations being built underground

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
away from Soviet spy satellites.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
In Cosmic Top Secret, William Hamilton discussed numerous statements

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
recounted to him, such as a 1988 sighting of a giant boomerang

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
over the Northrop facility and a flying saucer

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
seen taking off from a building on the property.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
The Northrop RCS facility has recorded several anomalous sightings throughout history,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
oftentimes glowing orbs seen around the facility.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
According to some researchers,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
the facility sees a disproportionate amount of sightings

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
compared to the Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities nearby.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
And this isn't the first time I've discussed this Northrop location.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Remember back to my work on the Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Let's reference forensic artist Bill McDonald's 1992 piece,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
the Tuhachibi Triangle,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
in which the artist drew a reverse-engineered triangular craft

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
detailed to him by disgruntled engineers from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
The engineers hailed from the Northrop RCS facility at Tehan

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
and Lockheed Martin-Hellendale RCS plant.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
According to their testimonies,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
the facilities doubled as UFO reverse engineering

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
and material exploitation locations.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
If you have not seen this investigation,

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
I highly recommend watching as the XF-131 Super Sentinel

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
is absolutely fascinating research.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
And RCS locations have actually seen much discussion in ufology.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
With the contentious Steven Greer in particular,

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
labeling the Hellendale plant as a staging ground for electro-gravitic ARV,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
and a forward operating base employing EMP weapons for ARV testing

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
and downing of non-human vehicles.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
and other senior officials had no idea of this.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
didn't know about it.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I had known about it since the 90s,

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
but I'd never of course flown directly over it

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
since the 1954-55 come out.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
They go up and they hover, they're silent,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
they're electro-gravitic, anti-grab.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
The diamond on the left, you see that it looks like a runway with a diamond?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
there's not an aerodynamic, they just go boom up.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
But they're placed over different diamonds.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
who don't have time to go through.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
And that's where they're put at various elevations

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Now this may seem extreme,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
but there is quite a bit of valid research

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
to discuss weapons that have been designed to down UAP.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
But what more can we factually learn about the underground portion

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
of the Tehan RCS facility?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
The Northrop site would then be discussed

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
in Dr. Richard Sodder's excellent book,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Underground Bases and Tunnels,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
which takes an evidence-based approach

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
to studying subterranean facilities,

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
aka deep underground military bases, DUMMS.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
This is my absolute favorite book on the subject of DUMMS

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
as Sodder tackles the subject often associated with conspiracies

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
with rigorous fact-based research.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Sodder states Northrop alongside numerous Fortune 500 companies

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
such as Lockheed Martin employ high-tech underground centers

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
in California and claims with a high degree of certainty

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
these facilities are, quote,

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
equally engaged in non-conventional high-tech aerospace research,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
end quote.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Dr. Sodder is equally confident the underground portion

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
of the Northrop RCS facility engages

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
in the same non-conventional research,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
but is unsure just how far beneath the Earth

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Northrop's activities extend.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Rumors persist under the site there exist as many

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
as 42 underground levels and connective tunnels

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
to nearby facilities as well as Edwards Air Force Base.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
The validity and very real existence of these locations

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
and tunnels will be another topic for another day

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
as there is quite a volume of valuable research

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
to speak to the legitimacy of interconnected

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
deep underground military bases.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Because yes, I do plan on using Dr. Sodder's research

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
for a full deep dive into DUMMS.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
But I would just like to say that TRW,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Northrop's golden child, also has a storied history

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
in connected subterranean facilities.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
and U.S. National Committee on Tunneling Technology,

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
USNC slash TT, conducted myriad studies, reports,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
and patents on underground ICBM-based design,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
tunneling technologies, tunnel boring machines,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
tunnel depths, et cetera.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
TRW engaged and published a number of studies

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
determining the viability of high-speed

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
ground transportation tunnel design.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
For example, we can analyze this 1968 report

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
where TRW discusses high-speed underground

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
transportation vehicles in tunnel diameters

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
ranging from 80 to 40 feet.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
At a depth of 400 to 2,500 feet.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Another topic for another day, as I stated.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Analyzing McDonald, Sodder, and Hamilton,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
the question must be asked,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
does Northrop Grumman test and operate

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
reverse engineered NHI vehicles?

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
Out of an underground facility beneath the Tehan RCS site,

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS locations

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
do, after all, reside in close proximity to

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Edwards Air Force Base, the former Norton Air Force Base,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
and Palmdale, USAF Plant 42.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Norton and Plant 42 are integral pieces

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
to the Fluxliner ARV testimony of Brad Sorensen

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
and Mark McCandlish.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And carefully connecting research

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
and analyzing the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Ed,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I have accused Edwards Air Force Base

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
and their 412th test group,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
as running a UFO reverse engineering testing program

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
between Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Several testimonies over the decades,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
outside of Echler, Miller, and McDonald's

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
four anonymous engineers have labeled

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Northrop Grumman directly,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
as participating in UFO crash retrieval,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
reverse engineering, and material exploitation.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Many will recall the testimony of Edgar Fouchet

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
and the TR-3B reverse engineer triangular craft.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Many write off Fouchet due to the absence

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
of hard physical proof of his claims.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
However, I do highly recommend viewing my piece

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
on triangle ARVs in general,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
as a tremendous amount of research

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
resulted from Fouchet's disclosures.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
The 250 foot prototype and 600 foot operational

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
TR-3B models according to Fouchet

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
saw test flights over Edwards Air Force Base,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
conducted by the AFFTC Air Force Test Center,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
which oddly enough operates under the 412th test group

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
which we discussed above.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Strange as near Edwards, where these test flights

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
allegedly occur, Northrop has nearby installations,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
both near Palmdale, USAF Plant 42,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
as well as a mysterious underground location

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
where anomalous craft have been reported

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
over the decades.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Fouchet also outright named the contractors

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
responsible for the construction of TR-3B.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
FFRDC's Sandia and Livermore Labs

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
reverse engineer the propulsion device.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But the primary contractors of the project

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
were listed as Lockheed, Boeing,

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Teledyne Ryan, and Northrop.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
I would now like to shift to a fascinating few details

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
from the whistleblower testimony of Colonel Steve Wilson.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Wilson's testimony was made public around 1997,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
shortly before his death,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
through researcher Dr. Richard Boylan.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Boylan has historically published some claims

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I approach with skepticism,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
so I tried multiple times to connect with him

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
regarding Wilson, but have heard nothing.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Colonel Steve Wilson does deserve his own video

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
as this enigmatic figure is well worth investigating.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
And disclaimer, we cannot 100% prove Wilson's

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
40-year military background,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
as numerous articles exist on the web detailing

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
his DD-214 in education, training, and medals.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
However, we do not have any scans or copies

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
of Wilson's official records or images of him in service.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
For this reason, I do also recommend reading

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Kevin Randall's skeptical take on Wilson

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
and Boylan's reporting, which raises concerns,

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
such as 40 years of service listed on Wilson's DD-214,

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
as well as seemingly misreported medals.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
To summarize Wilson's disclosures,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Wilson claimed in 1963 as a captain in the tactical

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
fighter squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
He was assigned to the Majestic 12 and promoted to Major.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Here, the then Major learned of the Majestic 12's

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
modus operandi to control, quote,

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
UFO surveillance and interdictions, retrievals,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
and analysis of records of extraterrestrial

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
spacecraft and occupants, and public access

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
to any information about these matters, end quote.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
As part of his duties, Wilson would be assigned

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
to the First Special Forces Air Command,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
and would undergrow special training with Delta Force

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and the then Black Berets.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
For nine years, Colonel Wilson claimed to visit

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
nearly every Air Force Base in the world

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
and make contact with key people for the Majestic 12 unit.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Wilson states, whilst a Lieutenant Colonel in 1972,

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
he was reassigned from First Special Forces Air Command

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
to Area S-4, near Papouse Lake, south of Area 51,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
by men with CIA credentials.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
I am skipping a tremendous amount of detail here,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
as this is not our subject for today,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
but Wilson would travel 30 stories underground

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
in the facility where he witnessed eight different

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
kinds of non-human craft, as well as an extremely

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
tall woman that appeared to be extraterrestrial.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
According to Wilson, S-4 operated to test

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
anti-gravity reverse engineered vehicles.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
The first successful flight had allegedly occurred

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
on July 18, 1971, a year before his station,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Interesting connection to Echler, Inman, and Shapiro,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
as we stated above.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
After some time at S-4, Wilson would claim to head

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
Project Pounce, an elite Air Force NRO Special Forces unit

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
which retrieved downed UFOs.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Oddly enough, Project Pounce can be observed

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
in the disputed Majestic 12 Project Aquarius document

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
to reduce public concern regarding UFOs.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
So, Wilson has a big, unprovable testimony.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
What does any of this have to do with Northrop Grumman?

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
In his disclosures to Dr. Boylan, Wilson additionally named

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
US Aerospace Vehicles that had been created

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
utilizing reverse engineered non-human technology.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Many of these vehicles would feature anti-gravity systems,

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
and after all of the research we've done on this channel

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
and the words of Jake Barber, maybe this isn't so far-fetched.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
The implications of what you're saying also are that potentially

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
there is some kind of capacity to draw incredible amounts of energy

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
from the quantum vacuum.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
I've seen it.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
You've seen it.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I've seen it.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
There's also, obviously, the capacity to use propulsion systems

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
that are far beyond what we're describing.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Yeah, that seems to be the case as well.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Anti-gravity.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Anti-gravity.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
They know about it.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Anti-gravity, zero point energy.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
Those secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Wilson would state US clandestine military operations

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
began flying the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
but also discussed an anti-gravity disc

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
that glowed intense orange-golden during flight.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Wilson claimed this craft was made by Northrop Aerospace

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
at their secret facility northeast of Lancaster, California.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
This location is quite interesting,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
as it matches the underground Northrop range

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
we discussed earlier in this investigation.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Wilson would even state the Northrop, Lockheed,

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities were connected alongside

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
Area 51 and other sensitive locations via underground train systems.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
Wilson claimed these tunnels were excavated by nuclear subterranes,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
which is actually very interesting.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Nuclear subterranes are massive tunneling machines

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
that work by melting rock with heat supplied

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
via a compact nuclear reactor.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Numerous patents for such machines were designed

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
by Los Alamos National Laboratories in the 1970s,

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
and don't worry, we will fully dive into this in the dumb video.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Boylan had reportedly witnessed this craft in test flight

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
over Area 51 in the Northrop complex near Edwards,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
dubbing it Northrop's Great Pumpkin Disk.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
These two siding locations are another fascinating connection to EDD,

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
and the joint reverse engineering effort between Edwards,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
contractors, and Area 51.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
Wilson made additional mentions to a reverse engineered craft

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
designated the XH-75D, or the XH Shark.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
This craft is allegedly an anti-gravity helicopter

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
designed by Teledyne Ryan San Diego Division.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Wilson claimed these craft were assigned to Delta IV

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
slash the NRO for UFO crash retrievals.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
This mention of NRO and Delta is indeed intriguing.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
Delta Force, part of the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC,

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
has been accused of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
under the CIA Office of Global Access, as has indeed the NRO.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
In fact, the NRO was one of two intelligence agencies,

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
the other being the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
we discussed above with C4ISR.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
David Grush worked on as liaison to the UAP Task Force,

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
where he discovered the existence of UAP legacy programs.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
The NRO was also one of three intelligence agencies

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
alongside the CIA and NSA mentioned by Edgar Fuchet

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
as managing the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Very little has been discussed on this craft,

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
the XH-75D, original drawing by Wilson on screen now.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
And almost no actionable investigation can arise

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
from Wilson's incredibly brief testimony on this craft.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
The Colonel never discussed the intended application

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
or function of the onboard anti-gravity system.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
What I do find interesting is a 2019 design concept

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
created by one of Lockheed Martin's subsidiaries,

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
the Sikorsky Raider X.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Dual rotor helicopters are not rare.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
They are often implemented on helicopters designed for heavy lift.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
One would have to ask why the XH-75D would need dual rotors

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
with an anti-gravity system.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But the Raider X, canceled in 24,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
sought to create a quote,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
agile, survivable compound coaxial helicopter

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
that will equip future aviators to address

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
evolving peer and near-peer threats

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
in the most difficult environments, end quote.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
No further linkages beyond design exist between these platforms.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
However, I do find it interesting the XH-75D,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
drawn by Wilson in 97,

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
looks almost identical to the concept craft

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
proposed by Lockheed in 2019.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
So is the anti-gravity disk in helicopter

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
proposed by Wilson real?

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Well, this is unfortunately a dead end of investigation.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
As I said, Wilson's testimony must be considered

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
little more than third-party research.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Because while it is fascinating

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
and ties intimately to some claims made regarding

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
UAP Legacy Recovery programs throughout history,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
there is little evidence or actionable data to pursue.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
I would, however, like to leave discussion of Wilson

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
with a chart he made regarding the structure

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
of UAP Legacy programs.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Please note, the rendition I am showing now

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
is a recreation of Wilson's 97 chart published in 2001.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Numerous spelling errors can be observed here,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
such as in Lockheed.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
This chart is titled Star Wars City

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
in reference to the Strategic Defense Initiative,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
the program we mentioned above,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
and a program I have discussed many times,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
instituted by Reagan in the 1980s

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
with possible ties to Eisenhower.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
To state again, the SDI program instituted to protect

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
the United States from ballistic nuclear attacks

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
has been referenced by numerous witnesses

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
who have stated the program had a backdoor functionality

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
to act offensively against UAP

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
and back-channeled funds to fund UFO Legacy programs.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
From the chart, Star Wars City

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
located under the Cheyenne Mountain Complex

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
oversees the U.S. Space Counterintelligence Headquarters

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
within the SDI as the nexus of UAP Legacy programs.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
Within this chart, there are numerous institutions

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
one might expect to be associated with UAP retrieval

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
and exploitation programs, the NRO,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
National Security Council, National Security Agency,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
CIA, NORAD, and Majestic 12.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
Adhering to the SDI, Colorado HQ, and Magi,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
there exists a list of contractors

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
alleged to engage with the UAP portfolio.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed,

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and IBM are mentioned.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
We also find Decision Science Applications Inc.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
DSAI was led by former Admiral

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
and recurring character of this project, Bobby Ray Inman,

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
and most likely had its assets handed over to SAIC.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
A contractor I believe is as involved in legacy operations

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
as Northrop or Lockheed.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Another project for another day,

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
as DSAI is quite a worthy investigation.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
DSI, according to the chart and Wilson's testimony,

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
consists of directors of relevant UAP black budget divisions

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
from the aforementioned contractors,

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
as well as Ford Aerospace, which is now part of Northrop Grumman,

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
and Teledyne Ryan,

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
which was one of Northrop's premium purchases.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
When Teledyne Ryan did indeed play a vital role

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
in the Strategic Defense Initiative,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
the contractor was well regarded for designing

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
and producing high-performance aerial targets,

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
which were crucial for testing and evaluation potential

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
for missile defense systems,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
as well as developing advanced sensors

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
that could be used for detecting and tracking

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
incoming ballistic missiles.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
TRW, Northrop's crown jewel,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
additionally aided in the SDI program,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
such as using its locations

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
for high-powered chemical laser testing.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And as we mentioned above,

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Northrop itself takes great pride in aiding in the SDI program

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
in 1983, creating the first laser radar used in space.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
It is fascinating, even in a testimony like Wilson's,

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
we can still find links to Northrop's many acquisitions

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
and UAP legacy programs.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
And now onto a whistleblower by the acronym of A-H

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
that appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
And I must state again, regarding Greer's witnesses,

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
let us analyze the quality and claims of the whistleblower

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
instead of the platform.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
Unfortunately, Greer's poor operational security

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
is ever-present, as clips of A-H are listed

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
in the DPI archive as Arnold House.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I believe I have located this individual

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
and have reached out to talk to him.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I have heard nothing.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
Arnold's testimony revolves around the significant information

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
he gained regarding UAP programs

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
while a surface technician at the Boeing Aerospace Company,

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
as well as insights gained from friend and four-star general,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Curtis LeMay.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
As we dive in, it is crucial to maintain awareness

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
how his disclosures are indeed secondhand.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
As far as his testimony,

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
House never participated directly in program operations.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
His information was handed to him from friends at NSA,

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
CIA, NASA, JPL,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Office of Naval Intelligence Area 51,

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
USAF, Northrop, Boeing, and various generals.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
This information was so complete, according to Greer,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
House briefed Bill Clinton in 1990.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
I have no evidence to confirm this briefing.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
The only possible link I can find is a letter to Clinton from Greer

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
marked 9 July 2000,

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
where Greer requested the city president to disclose

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
UFO-related USAPs at the suggestion of their mutual friend.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
I do find House very worthy of discussion

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
as we can find correspondences with him and Greer

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
as recently as 2018 and as old as December 2000.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Perhaps House, like William Hamilton,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
has served as one of Greer's primary sources of information

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
over the decades.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
In his taped testimony linked in description,

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
House stated one day around 1987

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
at the home of General Curtis LeMay,

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
the infamous general confirmed the Roswell, New Mexico crash.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
House also learned from his NSA friend that Henry Kissinger,

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
George Bush, as well as Ronald Reagan

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the UAP subject.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
His friends in CIA relayed to House

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
that they, along with USAF, had downed NHI craft.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
Arnold even claimed he learned from a friend in the FBI

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
that the Bureau had radar testing that was causing interference

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
with some of the craft resulting in crashes.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
This echoes Lieutenant Colonel Corso's sentiments

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
regarding the crash of the Roswell, New Mexico craft.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
House also learned and relayed there are underground bases

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
testing and maintaining TUOs,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
likely Dugway, Palmdale, California,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
Edwards Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and others.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
Interesting we see Palmdale and Edwards pop up once again.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
But now let's focus directly on Arnold's information

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
regarding Northrop.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
House's entire testimony could lead to an entire video

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
so maybe we will save that for whistleblowers volume 3.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
A.H. stated while at Boeing he met a man

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
in the Army Criminal Investigation Division, CID,

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
who was involved in several crash recovery since 1947

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
and had served in Army CIC, Counter Intelligence Corps, Capacity.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
The gentleman handpicked one of House's friends

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
at the Boeing aircraft company to become part of a UFO

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
crash recovery team in northern New Mexico starting in 1980.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
This friend of A.H. would somehow relay information

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
regarding his time in legacy program operations

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
from 1980 to 1997, 17 years.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
The time of these disclosures is not given, however,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
as investigators we must assume that his friend

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
informed Arnold after leaving program operations in 1997.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
House's friend was ultimately stationed and helped

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
with reverse engineering efforts and testing

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
of non-human craft at Area 51.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
He was not working for the U.S. government or military, however.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
His paychecks during these years in legacy programs

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
came directly from Northrop.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
The source would illustrate Northrop, Lockheed Martin,

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
and Boeing all engaged in UFO reverse engineering efforts

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
at Area 51.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
The facility itself from 1980 to 1997

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
held a tremendous amount of extraterrestrial debris

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
in a containment area.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
This source would also tell House some of the program

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
was shifted to a location in Utah,

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
likely dugway-proving grounds.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
They moved most of the stuff from Area 51,

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Just basically those companies and of course,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Lockheed and Northrop.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
This is very interesting as USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
said the exact same thing.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
Some Area 51 legacy programs were relocated to dugway

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
in the early 1990s.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
I myself have talked about dugway previously

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
and plan to revisit with a contractor witness

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
who claimed to stumble upon a floating saucer craft

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
within a classified testing area on base.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Here is where House's testimony regarding Area 51

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
and Northrop gets really interesting.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
This same friend told Arnold the A51 program

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
to test NHI vehicles and exploit technological materials

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
was called Project Red Light.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
and near, this is very funny, it's near Northrop.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
There's an underground area out there too

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
that he was aware of, but he particularly mentioned

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
and stayed focused on ANZA, California.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
There's some underground areas up there too

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
that they're researching some of this technology

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
This should immediately become familiar to many of my viewers

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
as I have referenced this Project Red Light

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
on numerous occasions.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I have traced first mention of this project

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
to the files of the late legendary researcher

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
Leonard Stringfield, author of Crash Retrieval Status Reports

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
1-7 and relayed by excellent researcher Michael Schrat.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
In a letter dated April 5th, 1980,

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one MH,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
a witness identity Schrat chose not to disclose.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
MH allegedly performed radio maintenance

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
at the atomic proving grounds in Nevada during 1961 to 1963,

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
along with top secret radio work for USAF.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
According to MH, he participated in a top secret operation

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
at Area 51 titled Project Red Light.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Test flights were conducted under this project

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
on a recovered UFO shipped from none other than Edwards Air Force Base.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
The craft was not conventionally powered

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
and stayed silent during operation.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Security was so tight on the project,

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
program personnel were rotated every six months.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
MH claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
American defense contractor encountering difficulties

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
in reverse engineering many of the components comprising the craft.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
I have drawn a parallel between Red Light and the testimony of Ed.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
We have referenced numerous times throughout this project,

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
a joint Edwards Area 51 reverse engineering program

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
out of the Edwards 412th Test Group.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
Well, Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
additionally mentioned Project Red Light.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Fouchet claimed he gathered knowledge

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
defense contractor EGNG was awarded an indefinite contract

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
for Project Red Light to support the DOE and military.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
If you have not heard of EGNG,

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
this is the contractor historically implicated with UAP programs

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
made infamous in the story of Bob Lazar

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
as the contractor that hired him to work out of Site 4.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
This contract gave EGNG responsibility

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and to provide aerial and ground security

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
for highly classified government and military sites.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
If the testimony of Arnold House

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
and his legacy program connections are indeed true,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Northrop Grumman could have indeed served

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
as a project manager for Project Red Light,

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
testing non-human intelligence and alien reproduction vehicles

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
in a joint contractor Edwards 412th Test Group operation.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
Absolutely incredible links to ponder.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
We have no project stork,

56:14.000 --> 56:19.000
we have no direct mention of Lockheed and so forth

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
but almost in a way I find that a little more intriguing

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
for my research.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
With Northrop we devoted so much time

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
to look specifically at Northrop Grumman's acquisitions

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM,

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
connections to Aerospace Corporation and FFRDCs

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
and I find this so fascinating how

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
Northrop's involvement outside of mentions of Fuchshe

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
and a couple other mentions here and there

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
and comments from Jack Northrop at the beginning of the video

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
they seem to purchase up buy-up companies

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
that had legacy operations.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
TRW and its implication in the Wilson Davis Memo

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
and the Phil Pentagon audit that almost outed the senior review group.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
$200 million today Northrop paid

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
to settle that lawsuit for TRW.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Now they acquired them I believe for $6 or $7 billion

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
that's a drop in the bucket

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
but it's interesting that a year after the acquisition

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Northrop's still okay with you know what TRW

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
you're implicated in this massive lawsuit

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
but don't worry we'll pay for it.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
So I find that sort of research absolutely

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
scintillating instead of just direct confirmations

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
and direct ties like we had with Lockheed and Battelle.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
I also find all of the whistleblower testimony

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
of Northrop to be incredibly fast

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
and you know I wouldn't be

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
surprised to see full projects on Steve Wilson

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and Arnold Howe soon.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
Like I mentioned I've tried to connect with House

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
because I do believe with a high degree of certainty

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I have found that individual

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
and Colonel or yeah,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Colonel Steve Wilson is no longer with us

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
he passed in 1997

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
but his testimony is still shrouded in mystery

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
and his legitimacy in USAF

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
is still surrounded in mystery

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
so a lot more to explore there

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
but I find it really interesting

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
from the work of William Hamilton

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
the testimony of AH

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
that there's still these little comments

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
that are ubiquitous around testimony

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
that I still find to be quite accurate

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
mentions of the SDI

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
and UAP Legacy programs mentioned

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Northrop's involvement in underground facilities

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
mention of underground facilities

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
mentioning you know dating to Fouché as well

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
projects being moved from Area 51

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
to Dugway Proving Grounds

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
even mentions of Area 51 in Edwards

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
as we see in Arnold Howe's

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Red Light, Fouché, etc.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So the question must be asked

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
why is Northrop's involvement

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
in Legacy programs operations

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
so shrouded

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
why do they pass under the radar

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
alongside companies like Boeing and Raytheon

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
while Lockheed Martin, while Battelle

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
these guys, I mean even General Electric

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
to a certain degree are always labeled

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
as the prime contractors

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
well I do have someone of a thesis there

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I think Battelle

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
bar biological storage

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
at probably Fort Detrick or Fort Belbois

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
is a little bit out of the game

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
they're a little bit said and done

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I think the three, four primary players

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
if we want to say

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
are Lockheed Boeing

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
who is likely a project manager

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
for operations

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Northrop and Raytheon

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I think these are the big guys

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I think that

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Lockheed is sort of like

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
a hound dog

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Lockheed will respond to a beck and call

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
they will do what is required of them

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
they are the loudest in the room

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
etc. I think Lockheed

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
is

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
they will take advantage of a situation

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
and they are opportunists

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
the reason I say this is the

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
2008 material transfer to OSAP

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
that was blocked by Glenn Gaffney

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
in the CIA

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
directorate of science and technology

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Lockheed itself

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
offered to divest itself of materials

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
now was this

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
to get in the good graces

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
of the CIA

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
the OGA, the DS&T

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
the NRO probably

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
did Lockheed give up

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
materials they could reverse engineer

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Lockheed give away materials they think

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
that any other

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
corporation or agency

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
could reverse engineer

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and garner insights from probably not

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
this was probably materials they thought

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
well if we can't figure it out no one else can

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
so we might as well

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
get in good favor with some people

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and get rid of these materials

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
which is likely from the 1953 Kigman, Arizona crash

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
but that's a whole other conversation

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Northrop

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
their work seems to be shrouded

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
in much more secrecy

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
they are not offering to divest themselves

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
of material they are often seen in the shadows

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
they are often tag-lined

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
in testimonies like Fouche's

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
as the

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
person in the shadows

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
so that makes the question

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
what work are they doing

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
well I believe it's material exploitation

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
reverse engineering and testing of ARV

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and likely project

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
managerial responsibilities

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
for the red light project if that is still ongoing

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
or if that has shifted since Ed's time

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
around

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Nellis and Edwards

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
ending in about 2006 to 2008

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
so if that project is still ongoing

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I think that Lockheed operates

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
similar to

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and I forgot one on the Mount Rushmore of Legacy

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
operations SAIC

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I think Northrop

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
alongside Lockheed alongside SAIC

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Boeing and perhaps Raytheon

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
they operate across all segments

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
of US military have commented numerous times

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
that

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
the Army, the Air Force

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and the Navy

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
their programs are extremely compartmentalized

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
stove piped as Eric Davis said

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
and don't really have much interaction with each other

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
the common threads here are the contractors

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
that interact

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
in programs across compartments

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and possibly the UARCs

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and FFRDCs that do as well

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
there might be some

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
small contractors that help out

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
with Air Force responsibilities

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
and one such company might be

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Alien Science and Technologies

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
helping Ed

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and the project red light

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
if you want to call it that out at Edwards

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
but the project managers

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
the companies that seem to do quite a bit

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
then engage in all facets

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
of legacy program operations

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
operate across all of these boards

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
so is Northrop still

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
ongoing in research I would probably say

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
yes and Northrop has

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
is up to their eyeballs just like SAIC

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
like Lockheed and just like Boeing

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
but these are my personal opinions

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I think that even though much of the research

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
we have studied today is still

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
whistleblower testimony and

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
a bit nebulous at some points

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
like Steve Wilson

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I still think there are numerous fascinating ties

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I mean

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
again I want to harken back

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
to Northrop's many acquisitions

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and even date that back to Sparey Rand

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
when it went defunct

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
its departments going to Northrop Grumman

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and Lockheed and others

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and connections to the Corso testimony

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
all of these neat little threads

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
that kind of tie Northrop

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and its purchasing streak interwoven

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
into stories of legacy

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
program operations it's very fascinating

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
in a sense this project was

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
almost a little bit more conclusive to me

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
than even Lockheed or Battelle

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I would like to know what everybody else here thinks

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
you know perhaps Northrop silence

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
is a sign of danger

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
we don't know all we can do is continue

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
to investigate and if you have any other

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
insights into Northrop

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
or testimony I would love to hear from

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
you and to tell me what you think in the comments

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
with that guys we will move on

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
because I think I've been ranting out for about

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
8 minutes please remember

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
to like and subscribe

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
always look forward to the next project

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
we'll get back in live

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
soon because I would like to talk

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
a little bit about concurring

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
events you know with the whistleblower

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
testimony of Jake Barber

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Dr. John Blitch

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Don Paul Bales

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
and so forth and Fred Baker

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
but I don't want to make that my channel

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I'm not a news of the day type of guy

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
as you all know you know there's a lot

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
of space between the videos so we'll figure

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
out something there so please remember to like

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
and subscribe guys I do have a patreon

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
you can find that on the channel page

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I don't gate keep content all of my

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
research as everybody knows is open source

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
so only support what

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
you think the channel is worth

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
you're not getting much extra there it's just

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
go help me out make these investigations

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
purchasing better camera equipment because

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
as everybody can see this camera isn't great

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
and you know maybe funding

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
my trips to go speak to witnesses

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
which I do plan to do quite soon so

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
thank you so much again for joining me and

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I will catch everybody on the next show

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
later everybody thanks
