0	4600	The propulsion of these UFOs is unique,
4600	5860	their ability to hover,
5860	8960	their ability to accelerate very rapidly,
8960	12400	their ability to move at very high speeds,
12400	15160	very much higher than anything that we have achieved,
15160	17180	even with our supersonic aircraft.
17180	20420	All of these things, and particularly interestingly,
20420	22520	without sonic booms and the things that we don't
22520	24400	like about our supersonic aircraft,
24400	27360	all of these things indicate a type of propulsion,
27360	28640	which is unique.
28840	30800	Different than anything we know anything about,
30800	32560	and which would be a tremendous value
32560	34960	if we could develop it and use it.
34960	37520	That's the reason I feel with a number of others
37520	40440	who have studied it, that it is a subject
40440	44120	which deserves the highest type of scientific study
44120	45400	and at an early date.
45400	48320	The advantages to be gained are perfectly enormous.
48320	49720	And how long do you feel it will be
49720	52380	before we are flying in UFOs?
54240	56440	Well, this probably is a $64 question
56440	58360	without a question without.
58400	60400	I think it depends, a great deal,
60400	63120	on how rapidly we take them seriously
63120	66280	and how soon we really set up
68200	71000	a scientific study team to work on the subject.
72200	74520	This is where we push the laws of physics.
76200	78480	You see, the technology we make
78480	80840	is what makes the impossible possible.
82680	83880	And it doesn't stop there.
84680	88440	So far on this channel,
88440	90920	we have devoted entire investigations
90920	92720	towards Battelle Memorial Institute
92720	95200	and their possible work on shape memory alloys
95200	98680	recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,
98680	100200	as well as Lockheed Martin
100200	102480	and their intimate decades long involvement
102480	104720	in UFO legacy programs.
104720	107640	After all, high profile US defense contractors
107640	110880	have for decades been accused of actively engaging
110880	112520	in material exploitation
112520	114480	and reverse engineering programs,
114480	117120	focused on technologies of unknown origin
117120	119080	in conjunction with various factions
119080	122440	within US government intelligence and military.
122440	124480	Overall, you know, the government
124480	126920	has been the custodian of a lot of this, right?
126920	128720	And they'll hand recede it out
128720	132520	to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,
132520	135480	which I find highly unethical.
135480	137600	You have basically a sole source arrangement
137600	141600	and you allow certain private corporate elements
141640	144680	to look at this, develop a potential insight
144680	146880	and then sell it back to the government for profit.
146880	150000	And I think that's totally unethical.
150000	152120	Lockheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work,
152120	156760	both in our atmosphere, in space, and even underwater.
156760	161760	There are certain efforts to...
162360	163800	It's a tough question you ask.
163800	166560	I left the Air Force and was sent out to California
166560	170760	at that time to begin establishing my cover basis
170760	174120	as an independent contractor
174120	177640	so that I can serve what was coming down the line next for me.
177640	182640	And that is the path which led to the UAP subject.
183360	185240	These claims are not without merit
185240	186320	as since the inception
186320	188520	of the US military industrial complex,
188520	191080	private defense industry has worked in tandem
191080	192920	with military and intelligence
192920	195080	to bolster US military might
195080	199720	protected by waived, unacknowledged special access programs.
199720	202200	I have directly accused Lockheed Martin,
202200	206560	Patel, Boeing, SAIC, and many other private institutions
206560	208560	and semi-private institutions,
208560	212720	such as UARCs and FFRDCs possessing, experimenting with
212720	215120	and possibly successfully harnessing
215120	217240	non-human technologies.
217240	220720	Today, we focus our sights towards the US Aerospace
220720	225200	and Defense Colossus and father of the B-2 stealth bomber,
225200	228080	Northrop Grumman, often overshadowed
228080	229600	by the infamy of Lockheed
229600	232200	and their involvement in the 2008 failed attempt
232200	236120	to divest recovered NHI materials to the OSAP program.
236120	239600	Northrop Grumman has largely successfully distanced itself
239600	241800	from the spotlight of defense contractors
241800	244680	engaging with UAP legacy programs.
244680	246320	In fact, focused discussion
246320	248800	on the alien reproduction vehicle, Fluxliner,
248800	250440	as relayed by Brad Sorensen
250440	253080	and the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle
253080	256120	discussed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
256160	258440	seemed to primarily focus on Lockheed.
258440	260920	These testimonies highlight the defense contractor
260920	263640	successfully reverse engineering non-human craft
263640	265600	to operate under human control.
265600	267360	But throughout such disclosures,
267360	270120	Lockheed isn't the sole contractor accused
270120	272360	of such highly classified efforts.
272360	275640	Hardly mentioned, but always alongside in the shadows
275640	277200	is Northrop Grumman.
277200	279600	Could Northrop Grumman truly be involved
279600	282040	in material exploitation of technologies
282040	284460	of unknown origin, TUOs?
284460	288340	Just how far does their involvement with UFO studies go?
288340	292340	Join me today as we peer into the shadows to find out.
292340	293900	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb
293900	295660	and thank you so much for joining me
295660	298660	as we touch back to UFOs in the private sector.
298660	300580	This time to Northrop Grumman.
300580	303300	The contractor I believe alongside Lockheed
303300	305940	is the Paramount Aerospace Corporation
305940	308860	entrenched in UFO legacy programs.
308860	311260	From whistleblower testimony to analysis
311260	314220	of Northrop's numerous acquisitions over the decades,
314220	317300	let's thoroughly dive into the legendary Northrop Grumman
317300	320700	and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.
325500	328260	Let's start by analyzing the history of Northrop
328260	332540	and its many, many, many acquisitions over the decades.
332540	334940	Northrop Grumman is an American aerospace
334940	339060	and defense company employing over 95,000 employees
339060	342020	with an annual revenue of $30 billion.
342020	345340	The industry giant has achieved extraordinary engineering
345340	347180	feat such as aiding in the development
347180	349060	of the James Webb Space Telescope
349060	353660	and directly creating the B-2 Spirit Bomber and B-21 Raider,
353660	356340	the world's only known stealth bombers.
356340	359260	Northrop Grumman operates in four major divisions,
359260	362300	aeronautics, defense, space and mission systems,
362300	363900	outside of military aircraft,
363900	366020	space systems and weapon development.
366020	368500	Northrop also engages in cyber security,
368500	372100	information technology and radar and sensor systems.
372100	374780	Briefly, I do take an extreme interest
374780	378220	in Northrop's C-4 ISR, Command Control,
378220	380540	Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
380540	382460	Surveillance and Reconnaissance,
382460	384540	which falls under Northrop's land-based
384540	386300	critical technology services,
386300	388180	sustainment and modernization.
388180	392060	C-4 ISR is essentially the military's nervous system
392060	395620	consisting of various electronic equipment and technologies
395620	397500	serving to aid the modern warfighter
397500	399380	through data and intelligence.
399380	401220	I am currently working on a thesis
401220	404420	that select contractor C-4 ISR programs
404420	408260	engage in deep-six waved USAPs for crash retrieval
408260	412300	and ARV testing, data and analysis, let me explain.
412300	414740	Northrop was one of the premier contractors
414740	418340	operating C-4 ISR for the Strategic Defense Initiative
418340	421100	instituted under Reagan in 1983.
421100	423340	Northrop created the first laser radar
423340	425220	used in space for SDI.
425260	427900	I have discussed numerous times lines of research
427900	432460	which state SDI focused on Soviet ICBM nuclear defense,
432460	435500	secretly studied and employed offensive capabilities
435500	438780	against UAP and siphoned program funds
438780	441620	to UAP legacy programs such as the DARS,
441620	443420	Defense Advanced Research Center,
443420	446100	proposed to exist in an ARPA document.
446100	449700	SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation,
449700	452820	frequently secures massive hundreds of million dollar
452860	454980	contracts for C-4 ISR
454980	457700	at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
457700	459860	I have published extensive research,
459860	462980	SAIC runs an off-world technologies division
462980	467100	to house recovered NHI artifacts at the Crane Naval location.
467100	469580	When discussing witness Ed in the existence
469580	471660	of a joint ARV testing program
471660	474180	out of Edwards Air Force Base in Area 51
474180	476140	under the Edwards 412 test group,
476140	479980	I made reference to a Lockheed Martin ISR case study.
479980	481780	In this study, Lockheed was tasked
481820	484740	with updating the system used by USAF Warfare Center
484740	487540	for Intelligence Collection and Data Processing.
487540	490820	Lockheed reconfigured a two phase security classification
490820	494700	system used by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
494700	497300	Yes, the same agency Grush was a part of
497300	499700	when liaison to the UAP task force
499700	501860	and the same agency recently mentioned
501860	504220	by respected journalist Chris Sharp
504220	508060	as participating in undersea UAP crash retrievals.
508060	510500	The system was implemented to the combined air
510540	513420	and space operation center at Nellis Air Force Base,
513420	515620	which is tasked with processing information
515620	518500	for exploitation of time sensitive targets.
518500	520100	At the time I speculated,
520100	522740	although this Lockheed project arose from challenges
522740	526700	in the Nellis Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training Exercise,
526700	529780	could such systems be used to monitor UAP
529780	531860	and UAP crash retrievals?
531860	534060	Although C4 ISR is common
534060	536020	and the nervous system of the armed forces,
536020	538660	I do think analyzing Defense Corporation's
538700	542980	C4 ISR contracts and projects with USAF Army
542980	545220	and Navy can lead to knocking on the door
545220	547780	of UAP program operations.
547780	549140	And after that long discussion,
549140	551860	finally back to the history of Northrop Grumman.
551860	555500	NG arose from the merging of two military aircraft companies,
555500	557500	the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Company
557500	560100	and the Northrop Company in 1994.
560100	561780	Throughout its storied history,
561780	564260	Northrop made a few very key acquisitions.
564260	566700	We will continue to reference over and over
567260	568660	again throughout this project.
568660	571780	One such acquisition occurred in 1999
571780	574060	with procurement of Teledyne Ryan,
574060	577260	developer of surveillance systems at unmanned aircraft.
577260	581060	In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc,
581060	583940	a corporation involved in aerospace, electronics
583940	585980	and the automotive industries.
585980	588380	Outside of computers, systems engineering,
588380	591780	integrated circuits, TRW was a true trailblazer
591780	593300	in spacecraft construction,
593340	596020	building pioneer one, 10 and numerous
596020	597740	space-based observatories.
597740	599980	The defense giant considered TRW,
599980	602340	its quote unquote capstone acquisition
602340	604260	signaling the end to Northrop Grumman's
604260	606220	aggressive purchasing streak.
606220	608780	Why was TRW considered the crown jewel
608780	610100	of Northrop's purchases?
610100	611820	While there is evidence to suggest
611820	614580	this was due to TRW operating a portfolio
614580	617620	of UAP legacy programs upon purchase.
617620	619780	Lengthy investigation must be done
619780	622260	to discover the UFO program portfolio
622260	625020	Northrop may have inherited from TRW.
625020	627220	TRW has long been associated
627220	629100	with a rumored crash retrieval program
629100	631220	run out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
631220	633660	a topic even touched on by Lou Elizondo
633660	635180	in his book Eminent.
635180	637780	And let's mention that in June of 1960,
637780	640820	TRW spawned the Aerospace Corporation.
640820	643220	The Aerospace Corporation has additionally
643220	645820	been implicated in UFO legacy programs
645820	647740	and served as a place for employment
647740	649580	for OSAP physicist and member
649580	652740	of the Wilson Davis meeting Dr. Eric Davis.
652740	654740	I would additionally like to draw attention
654740	658660	to the year the Aerospace Corporation was founded in 1960
658660	660740	and relate this founding to the testimony
660740	663540	of Lieutenant Colonel Philip J. Corso.
663540	667220	Corso stated 1958 to 1962 oversaw
667220	669580	the golden age of U.S. Army R&D
669580	672260	where Army assets, universities, laboratories,
672260	673980	and private industry were leveraged
673980	676420	to reverse engineer non-human technology
676420	678540	to bolster the U.S. war machine.
678580	680980	Analyzing Army primers from around this time
680980	683580	highlight a period of massive innovation
683580	685580	in Army research and development.
685580	689620	The MITRE Corporation was born during this time in 1959
689620	692220	with lines of research to suggest its formation
692220	695060	was to engage in such research and development projects
695060	698580	alongside Bell Labs, Sperry Rand, et cetera.
698580	702020	The Aerospace Corporation founded just one year post-MITRE,
702020	705580	maybe one additional corporation spawned from TRW
705580	708260	for U.S. Army legacy operations.
708260	711780	And worthy to note, both MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation
711780	714900	are both known as FFRDCs,
714900	717780	federally funded research and development centers.
717780	720460	Present day, the Aerospace Corporation manages
720460	723620	the Aerospace FFRDC for the Department of Defense
723620	725340	and Air Force to support, quote,
725340	729140	national security space programs, end quote.
729140	732220	We are truly the only space enterprise
732220	734380	that exists in the United States.
734380	737060	And I mean this at the agency level in the government,
737060	739820	the FFRDCs in private industry.
739820	741660	There is no other organization
741660	745060	that does national security space, civil and commercial,
745060	746700	and international as well,
746700	748620	that ties these all together with both the breadth
748620	750260	and the depth that we bring to this problem.
750260	753460	I have spoken at length about FFRDCs,
753460	755100	semi-private institutions
755100	758620	that play a crucial hand in UAP legacy programs.
758620	761540	I recommend any of my previous four investigations
761540	763260	to hear more on the subject.
763260	766620	It is intriguing, Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo,
766620	768940	all but admitted the Aerospace Corporation
768940	771460	built from TRW is actively involved
771460	773860	in UAP legacy programs.
773860	775060	And that up to that point,
775060	779780	TRW had been a primary contractor in such UFO programs.
779780	781700	So all this talk about private contractors,
781700	782700	you know, the big Lockheed Martin,
782700	785420	what about federally funded research and development centers,
785420	789220	such as MITRE, RAND, TRIAD, Oak Ridge, and UARC,
789220	790820	so university affiliated research centers,
790820	793100	where do they fall into this?
793100	794620	Only one, and I won't name it.
795620	800100	It started out as a contractor in 1960,
800100	802380	starting not too long after it was born.
802380	804860	It was actually a spinoff of TRW.
804860	808140	So TRW was the principal investigator for the first
809660	814420	roughly what, almost 30, yeah, practically, well, 29 years.
814420	816740	Before we keep discussing TRW,
816740	820420	let's highlight a former U.S. Premier Electronics Manufacturer
820420	822980	implicated in TUO exploitation
822980	826460	by Lieutenant Colonel Corsa with possible ties to MITRE
826460	828500	and the Aerospace Corporation,
828500	831260	this being the company I just mentioned above,
831260	833420	the Sparey RAND Corporation.
833420	835500	In his manuscript, Corsa would reference
835500	838700	the personal memoirs of Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau,
838700	840460	Chief of U.S. Army R&D
840460	843660	and Founder of the Army's Foreign Technology Division,
843660	846060	and how Trudeau would engage in frequent meetings
846060	847500	with Sparey RAND's board,
847500	850620	including legendary General Douglas MacArthur.
850620	853260	Sparey RAND went defunct in 1986
853260	856140	and its former divisions became part of Lockheed Martin,
856140	859780	Raytheon, Honeywell, and you guessed it, Northrop Grumman,
859780	863780	all companies implicated in UFO legacy programs.
863780	865980	But let's get back to TRW.
865980	869300	TRW features some familiar faces of this channel
869300	871380	many will recognize.
871380	874100	Remember if you will, Dr. Eric Walker,
874100	877540	the scientist named by physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher
877580	880460	as participating in UFO crash retrieval meetings
880460	884020	alongside Vannefar Bush in the 1950s.
884020	885700	Walker started Penn State's
885700	887780	University Affiliated Research Center,
887780	890420	self-admitted he knew about the Majestic 12
890420	895300	and was present at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.
895300	897380	I have always talked about how Walker
897380	900780	is one of the most crucial names in UFO crash retrieval
900780	904980	and reverse engineering programs in the 1950s and 1960s.
905020	906980	Much intrigues me about Walker,
906980	911060	including his position as former chairman of TRW.
911060	914180	TRW has also been discussed at length
914180	916980	by respected researchers such as Richard Dolan
916980	920260	as the primary contractor running a crash retrieval program
920260	922580	under the project named Zodiac.
922580	925260	Project Zodiac, an MJ-12-like entity,
925260	926820	is not our subject today.
926820	928660	However, we may discuss it soon
928660	931740	as the story of Zodiac by pseudonym Sedge Masters
931740	933940	is utterly captivating.
933940	937220	And with TRW, we may just have a paper trail
937220	941020	to connect them and Northrop to legacy operations.
941020	943820	In 2004, former assistant secretary
943820	945500	of housing and urban development,
945500	948380	Catherine Austin Fitz, wrote a paper called
948380	951220	The Black Budget of the United States.
951220	954620	This paper stated a large portion of the nation's wealth
954620	957020	had ongoing leave and illegally diverted
957020	959140	into secret, unaccountable channels
959140	963100	to support clandestine military research and development.
963100	966300	Some to a majority of which had been suggested
966300	968340	to be UAP-related.
968340	969780	While at the HUD department,
969780	971420	Fitz came across information
971420	974940	various high-profile defense contractors accounting systems
974940	977540	were responsible for scrubbing and obfuscating
977540	979740	the direction of these funds.
979740	982660	Although a 1990 federal law mandated
982660	985620	every single U.S. government agency be audited,
985620	988900	the Pentagon never publicly faced a comprehensive audit
988900	992680	until one was launched in December of 2017.
992680	994280	And not to mention since,
994280	997000	the Pentagon has never passed an audit.
997000	1000480	And this 2017 audit may have happened solely due
1000480	1003560	to another Catherine Austin Fitz University paper
1003560	1008560	detailing $21 trillion in unauthorized spending
1008560	1011080	in the DOD and Department of Housing
1011080	1014920	and Urban Development from 1998 to 2015.
1014920	1016440	In the Wilson Davis memo,
1016440	1018660	which I have talked about so many times,
1018660	1021800	Admiral Thomas Wilson relates to Dr. Eric Davis,
1021840	1022920	the watch committee,
1022920	1026520	the gatekeepers of the UAP legacy program portfolio,
1026520	1029160	told Wilson they are organized after an audit
1029160	1032360	in the 1990s almost blew their cover.
1032360	1035120	What this means is essentially a failed audit
1035120	1037800	led to UAP programs being reorganized
1037800	1040760	under the special access program oversight committee,
1040760	1042600	senior review group.
1042600	1044240	Here is where we circle back.
1044240	1047440	In 2003, Northrop Grumman settled a lawsuit
1047440	1051400	from the U.S. government for $111 million,
1051400	1054400	almost $200 million today.
1054400	1058440	This settlement was due to Northrop subsidiary TRW,
1058440	1062200	overcharging for government work done on space projects
1062200	1064840	in the early 1990s.
1064840	1069120	This suggests TRW's inflated space project contracts
1069120	1071920	were implicated and uncovered in the failed audit
1071920	1073880	mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo
1073880	1076640	that took place in the 1990s.
1076640	1079560	Timelines indeed match up as the beginning roots
1079600	1083480	of this lawsuit can be traced back to 1994.
1083480	1086840	TRW's likely involvement with UAP legacy
1086840	1089640	waived unacknowledged special access programs
1089640	1091760	appeared as contract overcharging
1091760	1094680	to the wider DOD auditing officials,
1094680	1097160	leading to the lawsuit against TRW
1097160	1100200	settled by Northrop, utterly fascinating.
1100200	1102280	If this hypothesis is accurate,
1102280	1106040	Northrop settled the suit and reorganized their UAP portfolio
1106040	1109640	under the SAPOX Senior Review Group program reorganization
1109640	1111440	that was relayed to Wilson.
1111440	1115000	To make Northrop's purchase of TRW even more interesting,
1115000	1118360	shortly before Northrop bought TRW in 2002,
1118360	1123360	TRW had purchased BDM, Braddock Dunn and McDonald in 1997.
1124000	1126200	BDM was a technical services firm
1126200	1128320	that headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas,
1128320	1130360	White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico,
1130360	1132840	and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.
1132840	1135520	BDM specialized in and worked primarily
1135520	1138040	with missile guidance, application optics,
1138040	1141640	electronic instrumentation, and radiation physics.
1141640	1144760	BDM was also founded in 1959,
1144760	1148560	around the same time as MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation.
1148560	1152240	BDM was mentioned specifically by Commander Will Miller
1152240	1155360	of the Wilson Davis Memo in the year 2000.
1155360	1157280	The former U.S. Navy commander
1157280	1159440	stated numerous government individuals
1159440	1162040	such as Defense Intelligence Agency directors
1162040	1164920	who in this case would have been Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson
1164960	1167360	were isolated from UAP knowledge.
1167360	1169520	The quote-unquote keepers of the secrets
1169520	1173120	resided in DOD middle management and civilian contractors
1173120	1176360	like Boeing, Lockheed, and BDM.
1176360	1177720	To learn more about Miller
1177720	1179360	and why his words carry weight,
1179360	1181320	I highly recommend watching my video
1181320	1182680	on the Wilson Davis Memo.
1182680	1185480	Sure, it's my first video and it's very amateurish,
1185480	1187760	but there's still some good information there.
1187760	1189760	BDM could warrant its own video,
1189760	1192240	but for now, I leave you with this.
1192240	1195720	Just like FFRDCs, I have talked ad nauseam
1195720	1197920	of Major General Albert Stubblebine
1197920	1200840	and how his department, U.S. Army INSCOM
1200840	1202640	and their previous Special Forces Unit,
1202640	1204560	the Intelligence Support Activity,
1204560	1208320	have been historically involved with UAP crash retrieval.
1208320	1211800	In 1984, Stubblebine was replaced as head of INSCOM
1211800	1215520	and went on to serve as vice president for BDM.
1215520	1217960	The following year in 1985,
1217960	1221320	BDM would host an advanced theoretical physics conference
1221320	1225360	to discuss UFO reverse engineering opportunities.
1225360	1228280	And actually, let's not stop there with BDM.
1228280	1231600	In 1989, NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler
1231600	1234880	was introduced to retired rear admiral Sumner Shapiro
1234880	1236600	from Bobby Ray Inman.
1236600	1240440	Inman was then board member of SAIC and Wackenhut
1240440	1244180	and former NSA director and CIA deputy director.
1244180	1247480	I have reason to believe Inman engaged with UAP programs
1247480	1249040	in each of these four positions,
1249040	1251080	but that is not our topic for today.
1251080	1253840	Shapiro told Eschler factions within the U.S.
1253840	1255840	possess extraterrestrial vehicles
1255840	1258960	and that he had even studied one at close quarters.
1258960	1262200	According to Shapiro, teams would take apart craft,
1262200	1264600	pack them up and ship them across the country
1264600	1266200	to different locations.
1266200	1269280	These craft featured unique interlocking components
1269280	1272000	that had to be dissembled in an exact sequence
1272000	1273640	to be put back together.
1273640	1276000	Rear admiral Shapiro was not only
1276000	1278080	former director of naval intelligence,
1278080	1283080	but also BDM international board member at the time, 1989.
1283500	1285740	To this day, Northrop Grumman maintains
1285740	1288200	a major corporate presence in Tyson Corner
1288200	1290720	near the former BDM headquarters.
1290720	1293880	All of this commentary on TRW, Teledyne Ryan,
1293880	1295840	which we will get to shortly in BDM,
1295840	1297680	served to highlight how Northrop Grumman
1297680	1301160	and its many acquisitions interweave intimately
1301160	1304100	with numerous cases we have covered on this channel.
1304100	1306840	If the claims of Philip J. Corso are indeed true,
1306840	1309480	Northrop's modern day legacy program operations
1309480	1312320	can likely trace its roots back to the US Army's
1312320	1316800	golden age of research and development in 1958 to 1962.
1316800	1319240	This would also mean many of Northrop Corporation
1319240	1320900	and Northrop Grumman's acquisitions
1320900	1323040	were to purchase companies that had active,
1323040	1326080	ongoing UFO legacy programs.
1326080	1328760	This sort of context is crucial to establish
1328760	1330880	before we explore whistleblower claims
1330880	1333920	of Northrop's operations in these programs.
1333920	1335800	And last thing before we continue,
1335800	1338940	many individuals think of Lockheed Skunkworks Division
1338940	1341160	when they picture UFO reverse engineering
1341160	1344400	and material exploitation programs in the private sector.
1344400	1347600	Well, in 1992, Northrop created its own
1347600	1350120	quote unquote answer to Skunkworks.
1350120	1353080	Northrop created the NATDC,
1353080	1355840	Northrop Advanced Technology and Design Center
1355840	1360080	to focus on the company's core key defense programs.
1360680	1365680	While we have already discussed many of NG's acquisitions
1366080	1368080	and their ties to UFO legacy programs
1368080	1370600	from the 1960s to 1990s,
1370600	1372600	let's back up and trace mentions
1372600	1375080	and claims surrounding specifically
1375080	1378280	the Northrop Corporation and later Northrop Grumman.
1378280	1381040	I often think back to the words of US Army Colonel
1381040	1384520	and advisor to US Army Futures Command, Carl Nell,
1384520	1385520	who once stated,
1386120	1388000	Non-human intelligence exists.
1388000	1391080	Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity.
1391080	1395200	This interaction is not new and it's been ongoing.
1395200	1398040	And there are unelected people in the government
1398040	1399760	that are aware of that.
1399760	1403200	And so, Carl, that is quite a bold statement.
1405200	1407200	I'm wondering and I'm curious,
1407200	1410600	how confident are you that that is true?
1410600	1412000	There's zero doubt.
1413000	1416000	Nell has served as an outspoken advocate for David Grush
1416000	1419000	and the existence of technologies of unknown origin.
1419000	1422000	One has to wonder if this absence of doubt
1422000	1425000	arose from Nell's position as Deputy CTO
1425000	1428000	and Director of Systems Engineering and Integration
1428000	1431000	for 13 years on Northrop Grumman.
1431000	1434000	After all, while serving as Northrop's Deputy CTO,
1434000	1437000	Nell was additionally serving as Command Representative
1437000	1440000	to US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Service,
1440000	1444000	US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Material Program.
1444000	1447000	Northrop's earliest contributions to legacy programs
1447000	1449000	may trace back to 1968.
1449000	1453000	MS Can and GM Andrew of Northrop Northair
1453000	1456000	published a paper on the electro aerodynamics
1456000	1459000	in supersonic flow, suggesting Northrop was researching
1459000	1461000	methods to reduce drag of an aircraft
1461000	1465000	by creating an electrostatic field around the craft.
1465000	1469000	This may remind some of T. Townsend-Brown and electro-gravidics.
1469000	1472000	In Nick Cook's excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point,
1472000	1475000	one Dan Marcus is mentioned, a pseudonym for a source
1475000	1478000	in the British aerospace industry.
1478000	1481000	Marcus relayed to Cook that in 2002,
1481000	1483000	the Pentagon pulled the specific paper and, quote,
1483000	1485000	made it disappear, end quote.
1485000	1488000	Marcus would suggest the B-2 Spirit Bomber
1488000	1491000	applied these concepts to employ an electrostatic field
1491000	1494000	around the aircraft to reduce drag.
1494000	1497000	In fact, some UFO researchers such as Michael Schrap
1497000	1500000	and Dr. Richard Boylan take this a step further,
1500000	1503000	suggesting the B-2 employs reverse engineered
1503000	1505000	possibly electro-gravidic technology,
1505000	1508000	leading to the massive cost of the systems.
1508000	1510000	The question is, and Mark talked about this before,
1510000	1513000	is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye?
1513000	1517000	Aviation Week Space Technology, March 9, 1992,
1517000	1523000	had a very interesting article from people
1523000	1525000	who worked at Northrop who were very upset
1525000	1529000	that the technology associated with the B-2 program
1529000	1532000	was not being trickled down to the public industry.
1532000	1535000	They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges
1535000	1538000	the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature.
1538000	1541000	That's what you see in this diagram right here.
1541000	1543000	And then negatively charges the exhaust gases
1543000	1545000	to reduce the infrared signature.
1545000	1548000	This is the same type of electro-gravidic technology
1548000	1552000	that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s.
1552000	1555000	So this technology might date back a lot earlier
1555000	1557000	than we originally thought.
1557000	1560000	The first true mention of Northrop engaging with NHI technology
1560000	1564000	comes from the work of UFO researcher William Hamilton.
1564000	1566000	Hamilton's book, Cosmic Top Secret,
1566000	1570000	is in my opinion the most underappreciated book
1570000	1572000	in all of ufology.
1572000	1576000	It is a truly excellent piece, decades ahead of its time.
1576000	1580000	For example, the 1992 book makes the first recorded mention
1580000	1583000	of the term ARV and discussion of the Fluxliner,
1583000	1586000	which wouldn't rise to fame until Stephen Greer's
1586000	1588000	2001 disclosure project event.
1588000	1591000	Mind you, Hamilton did misquote the ARV acronym
1591000	1596000	stating Alien Replicated Vehicle instead of Alien Reproduction Vehicle.
1596000	1599000	However, my research has shown Hamilton spoke to Bill Scott
1599000	1601000	of Aviation Week in Space Technology
1601000	1604000	to discuss the Brad Sorenson Fluxliner testimony
1604000	1606000	in the early 90s.
1606000	1608000	The next time someone tries to say Stephen Greer
1608000	1611000	coined the term ARV, send them this passage.
1611000	1614000	And Hamilton actually told Greer about the 1988
1614000	1617000	Norton Air Force Base Show Fluxliner incident
1617000	1620000	and actually passed along both primary witness Sorenson
1620000	1623000	and aerospace illustrator McCandlish to Greer.
1623000	1626000	Hamilton was one of the first to draw serious research
1626000	1630000	to the Antelope Valley, California, near Edwards Air Force Base.
1630000	1634000	Hamilton drew attention to Lockheed's Gunkworks, Rockwell,
1634000	1637000	McDonnell Douglas, and Northrop, all having plants
1637000	1639000	in Palmdale, California.
1639000	1642000	The nation's then chief center of aerospace technology
1642000	1646000	in the middle of these complexes sat Air Force Plant 42,
1646000	1649000	a name many associate with UAP programs.
1649000	1652000	The author of Cosmic Top Secret does not draw attention
1652000	1655000	to the Northrop facility near Palmdale,
1655000	1658000	but instead to a secret underground installation
1658000	1661000	north in the Tujachepe Mountains.
1661000	1665000	Hamilton accuses the Northrop-Tahan Ranch Radar Cross-Section Facility
1665000	1670000	and accompanying underground installation as a UAP program facility.
1670000	1674000	Very little is known about this facility and the underground extension,
1674000	1676000	but let's see what we can dig up.
1676000	1680000	This site officially serves as a radar cross-section range.
1680000	1684000	Quickly, what exactly is a radar cross-section facility?
1684000	1688000	To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves
1688000	1690000	to test aircraft radar signatures.
1690000	1693000	The sites utilize large runways and pylons
1693000	1695000	raised from underground on concrete diamonds
1695000	1699000	as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.
1699000	1703000	Many RCS facilities saw construction during the Cold War.
1703000	1706000	This led the majority of installations being built underground
1706000	1710000	to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies
1710000	1713000	away from Soviet spy satellites.
1713000	1717000	In Cosmic Top Secret, William Hamilton discussed numerous statements
1717000	1721000	recounted to him, such as a 1988 sighting of a giant boomerang
1721000	1724000	over the Northrop facility and a flying saucer
1724000	1726000	seen taking off from a building on the property.
1726000	1731000	The Northrop RCS facility has recorded several anomalous sightings throughout history,
1731000	1734000	oftentimes glowing orbs seen around the facility.
1734000	1736000	According to some researchers,
1736000	1739000	the facility sees a disproportionate amount of sightings
1739000	1743000	compared to the Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities nearby.
1743000	1747000	And this isn't the first time I've discussed this Northrop location.
1747000	1751000	Remember back to my work on the Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle,
1751000	1754000	the XF-131 Super Sentinel.
1754000	1758000	Let's reference forensic artist Bill McDonald's 1992 piece,
1758000	1760000	the Tuhachibi Triangle,
1760000	1764000	in which the artist drew a reverse-engineered triangular craft
1764000	1769000	detailed to him by disgruntled engineers from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
1769000	1773000	The engineers hailed from the Northrop RCS facility at Tehan
1773000	1776000	and Lockheed Martin-Hellendale RCS plant.
1776000	1778000	According to their testimonies,
1778000	1781000	the facilities doubled as UFO reverse engineering
1781000	1784000	and material exploitation locations.
1784000	1786000	If you have not seen this investigation,
1786000	1790000	I highly recommend watching as the XF-131 Super Sentinel
1790000	1793000	is absolutely fascinating research.
1793000	1797000	And RCS locations have actually seen much discussion in ufology.
1797000	1800000	With the contentious Steven Greer in particular,
1800000	1805000	labeling the Hellendale plant as a staging ground for electro-gravitic ARV,
1805000	1810000	and a forward operating base employing EMP weapons for ARV testing
1810000	1813000	and downing of non-human vehicles.
1813000	1816000	Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee
1816000	1819000	and other senior officials had no idea of this.
1819000	1826000	The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system
1826000	1828000	didn't know about it.
1828000	1830000	I had known about it since the 90s,
1830000	1833000	but I'd never of course flown directly over it
1833000	1836000	because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.
1836000	1842000	So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.
1842000	1846000	It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building
1846000	1850000	since the 1954-55 come out.
1850000	1853000	They go up and they hover, they're silent,
1853000	1855000	they're electro-gravitic, anti-grab.
1855000	1859000	The diamond on the left, you see that it looks like a runway with a diamond?
1859000	1861000	It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get,
1861000	1864000	there's not an aerodynamic, they just go boom up.
1864000	1866000	But they're placed over different diamonds.
1866000	1868000	I have a whole series of video and pictures of these
1868000	1869000	who don't have time to go through.
1869000	1872000	And that's where they're put at various elevations
1872000	1877000	and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon
1877000	1882000	to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.
1883000	1885000	Now this may seem extreme,
1885000	1887000	but there is quite a bit of valid research
1887000	1891000	to discuss weapons that have been designed to down UAP.
1891000	1895000	But what more can we factually learn about the underground portion
1895000	1898000	of the Tehan RCS facility?
1898000	1900000	The Northrop site would then be discussed
1900000	1903000	in Dr. Richard Sodder's excellent book,
1903000	1905000	Underground Bases and Tunnels,
1905000	1907000	which takes an evidence-based approach
1907000	1909000	to studying subterranean facilities,
1909000	1913000	aka deep underground military bases, DUMMS.
1913000	1917000	This is my absolute favorite book on the subject of DUMMS
1917000	1921000	as Sodder tackles the subject often associated with conspiracies
1921000	1923000	with rigorous fact-based research.
1923000	1927000	Sodder states Northrop alongside numerous Fortune 500 companies
1927000	1930000	such as Lockheed Martin employ high-tech underground centers
1930000	1934000	in California and claims with a high degree of certainty
1934000	1936000	these facilities are, quote,
1936000	1941000	equally engaged in non-conventional high-tech aerospace research,
1941000	1942000	end quote.
1942000	1945000	Dr. Sodder is equally confident the underground portion
1945000	1947000	of the Northrop RCS facility engages
1947000	1950000	in the same non-conventional research,
1950000	1953000	but is unsure just how far beneath the Earth
1953000	1955000	Northrop's activities extend.
1955000	1958000	Rumors persist under the site there exist as many
1958000	1961000	as 42 underground levels and connective tunnels
1961000	1965000	to nearby facilities as well as Edwards Air Force Base.
1965000	1968000	The validity and very real existence of these locations
1968000	1971000	and tunnels will be another topic for another day
1971000	1974000	as there is quite a volume of valuable research
1974000	1977000	to speak to the legitimacy of interconnected
1977000	1979000	deep underground military bases.
1979000	1983000	Because yes, I do plan on using Dr. Sodder's research
1983000	1985000	for a full deep dive into DUMMS.
1985000	1988000	But I would just like to say that TRW,
1988000	1991000	Northrop's golden child, also has a storied history
1991000	1994000	in connected subterranean facilities.
1994000	1998000	In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
1998000	2001000	and U.S. National Committee on Tunneling Technology,
2001000	2006000	USNC slash TT, conducted myriad studies, reports,
2006000	2009000	and patents on underground ICBM-based design,
2009000	2011000	tunneling technologies, tunnel boring machines,
2011000	2013000	tunnel depths, et cetera.
2013000	2016000	TRW engaged and published a number of studies
2016000	2019000	determining the viability of high-speed
2019000	2021000	ground transportation tunnel design.
2021000	2024000	For example, we can analyze this 1968 report
2024000	2027000	where TRW discusses high-speed underground
2027000	2029000	transportation vehicles in tunnel diameters
2029000	2032000	ranging from 80 to 40 feet.
2032000	2035000	At a depth of 400 to 2,500 feet.
2035000	2038000	Another topic for another day, as I stated.
2038000	2041000	Analyzing McDonald, Sodder, and Hamilton,
2041000	2043000	the question must be asked,
2043000	2045000	does Northrop Grumman test and operate
2045000	2048000	reverse engineered NHI vehicles?
2048000	2052000	Out of an underground facility beneath the Tehan RCS site,
2052000	2056000	the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS locations
2056000	2059000	do, after all, reside in close proximity to
2059000	2062000	Edwards Air Force Base, the former Norton Air Force Base,
2062000	2065000	and Palmdale, USAF Plant 42.
2065000	2068000	Norton and Plant 42 are integral pieces
2068000	2071000	to the Fluxliner ARV testimony of Brad Sorensen
2071000	2072000	and Mark McCandlish.
2072000	2074000	And carefully connecting research
2074000	2077000	and analyzing the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Ed,
2077000	2079000	I have accused Edwards Air Force Base
2079000	2081000	and their 412th test group,
2081000	2084000	as running a UFO reverse engineering testing program
2084000	2087000	between Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range.
2093000	2095000	Several testimonies over the decades,
2095000	2097000	outside of Echler, Miller, and McDonald's
2097000	2099000	four anonymous engineers have labeled
2099000	2101000	Northrop Grumman directly,
2101000	2103000	as participating in UFO crash retrieval,
2103000	2106000	reverse engineering, and material exploitation.
2106000	2109000	Many will recall the testimony of Edgar Fouchet
2109000	2112000	and the TR-3B reverse engineer triangular craft.
2112000	2115000	Many write off Fouchet due to the absence
2115000	2117000	of hard physical proof of his claims.
2117000	2120000	However, I do highly recommend viewing my piece
2120000	2122000	on triangle ARVs in general,
2122000	2124000	as a tremendous amount of research
2124000	2126000	resulted from Fouchet's disclosures.
2126000	2130000	The 250 foot prototype and 600 foot operational
2130000	2132000	TR-3B models according to Fouchet
2132000	2135000	saw test flights over Edwards Air Force Base,
2135000	2139000	conducted by the AFFTC Air Force Test Center,
2139000	2142000	which oddly enough operates under the 412th test group
2142000	2144000	which we discussed above.
2144000	2146000	Strange as near Edwards, where these test flights
2146000	2149000	allegedly occur, Northrop has nearby installations,
2149000	2152000	both near Palmdale, USAF Plant 42,
2152000	2154000	as well as a mysterious underground location
2154000	2156000	where anomalous craft have been reported
2156000	2158000	over the decades.
2158000	2160000	Fouchet also outright named the contractors
2160000	2163000	responsible for the construction of TR-3B.
2163000	2166000	FFRDC's Sandia and Livermore Labs
2166000	2168000	reverse engineer the propulsion device.
2168000	2170000	But the primary contractors of the project
2170000	2172000	were listed as Lockheed, Boeing,
2172000	2175000	Teledyne Ryan, and Northrop.
2175000	2178000	I would now like to shift to a fascinating few details
2178000	2182000	from the whistleblower testimony of Colonel Steve Wilson.
2182000	2185000	Wilson's testimony was made public around 1997,
2185000	2187000	shortly before his death,
2187000	2190000	through researcher Dr. Richard Boylan.
2190000	2192000	Boylan has historically published some claims
2192000	2194000	I approach with skepticism,
2194000	2196000	so I tried multiple times to connect with him
2196000	2198000	regarding Wilson, but have heard nothing.
2198000	2201000	Colonel Steve Wilson does deserve his own video
2201000	2204000	as this enigmatic figure is well worth investigating.
2204000	2207000	And disclaimer, we cannot 100% prove Wilson's
2207000	2209000	40-year military background,
2209000	2212000	as numerous articles exist on the web detailing
2212000	2215000	his DD-214 in education, training, and medals.
2215000	2218000	However, we do not have any scans or copies
2218000	2221000	of Wilson's official records or images of him in service.
2221000	2224000	For this reason, I do also recommend reading
2224000	2226000	Kevin Randall's skeptical take on Wilson
2226000	2229000	and Boylan's reporting, which raises concerns,
2229000	2233000	such as 40 years of service listed on Wilson's DD-214,
2233000	2236000	as well as seemingly misreported medals.
2236000	2238000	To summarize Wilson's disclosures,
2238000	2241000	Wilson claimed in 1963 as a captain in the tactical
2241000	2244000	fighter squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
2244000	2248000	He was assigned to the Majestic 12 and promoted to Major.
2248000	2251000	Here, the then Major learned of the Majestic 12's
2251000	2254000	modus operandi to control, quote,
2254000	2257000	UFO surveillance and interdictions, retrievals,
2257000	2259000	and analysis of records of extraterrestrial
2259000	2262000	spacecraft and occupants, and public access
2262000	2265000	to any information about these matters, end quote.
2265000	2268000	As part of his duties, Wilson would be assigned
2268000	2270000	to the First Special Forces Air Command,
2270000	2273000	and would undergrow special training with Delta Force
2273000	2275000	and the then Black Berets.
2275000	2278000	For nine years, Colonel Wilson claimed to visit
2278000	2280000	nearly every Air Force Base in the world
2280000	2283000	and make contact with key people for the Majestic 12 unit.
2283000	2287000	Wilson states, whilst a Lieutenant Colonel in 1972,
2287000	2290000	he was reassigned from First Special Forces Air Command
2290000	2292000	at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California
2292000	2297000	to Area S-4, near Papouse Lake, south of Area 51,
2297000	2299000	by men with CIA credentials.
2299000	2302000	I am skipping a tremendous amount of detail here,
2302000	2304000	as this is not our subject for today,
2304000	2307000	but Wilson would travel 30 stories underground
2307000	2309000	in the facility where he witnessed eight different
2309000	2312000	kinds of non-human craft, as well as an extremely
2312000	2315000	tall woman that appeared to be extraterrestrial.
2315000	2318000	According to Wilson, S-4 operated to test
2318000	2321000	anti-gravity reverse engineered vehicles.
2321000	2324000	The first successful flight had allegedly occurred
2324000	2328000	on July 18, 1971, a year before his station,
2328000	2331000	which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test.
2331000	2334000	Interesting connection to Echler, Inman, and Shapiro,
2334000	2336000	as we stated above.
2336000	2339000	After some time at S-4, Wilson would claim to head
2339000	2343000	Project Pounce, an elite Air Force NRO Special Forces unit
2343000	2346000	which retrieved downed UFOs.
2346000	2348000	Oddly enough, Project Pounce can be observed
2348000	2352000	in the disputed Majestic 12 Project Aquarius document
2352000	2357000	and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report.
2357000	2360000	Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel
2360000	2363000	to reduce public concern regarding UFOs.
2363000	2366000	So, Wilson has a big, unprovable testimony.
2366000	2370000	What does any of this have to do with Northrop Grumman?
2370000	2373000	In his disclosures to Dr. Boylan, Wilson additionally named
2373000	2376000	US Aerospace Vehicles that had been created
2376000	2379000	utilizing reverse engineered non-human technology.
2379000	2382000	Many of these vehicles would feature anti-gravity systems,
2382000	2385000	and after all of the research we've done on this channel
2385000	2389000	and the words of Jake Barber, maybe this isn't so far-fetched.
2389000	2393000	The implications of what you're saying also are that potentially
2393000	2398000	there is some kind of capacity to draw incredible amounts of energy
2398000	2400000	from the quantum vacuum.
2400000	2401000	I've seen it.
2401000	2402000	You've seen it.
2402000	2403000	I've seen it.
2403000	2408000	There's also, obviously, the capacity to use propulsion systems
2408000	2410000	that are far beyond what we're describing.
2410000	2413000	Yeah, that seems to be the case as well.
2413000	2414000	Anti-gravity.
2414000	2415000	Anti-gravity.
2415000	2417000	They know about it.
2418000	2420000	Anti-gravity, zero point energy.
2420000	2423000	Those secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge.
2423000	2426000	Wilson would state US clandestine military operations
2426000	2430000	began flying the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle,
2430000	2433000	but also discussed an anti-gravity disc
2433000	2436000	that glowed intense orange-golden during flight.
2436000	2440000	Wilson claimed this craft was made by Northrop Aerospace
2440000	2444000	at their secret facility northeast of Lancaster, California.
2444000	2446000	This location is quite interesting,
2446000	2449000	as it matches the underground Northrop range
2449000	2452000	we discussed earlier in this investigation.
2452000	2454000	Wilson would even state the Northrop, Lockheed,
2454000	2458000	and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities were connected alongside
2458000	2463000	Area 51 and other sensitive locations via underground train systems.
2463000	2468000	Wilson claimed these tunnels were excavated by nuclear subterranes,
2468000	2470000	which is actually very interesting.
2470000	2473000	Nuclear subterranes are massive tunneling machines
2473000	2475000	that work by melting rock with heat supplied
2475000	2478000	via a compact nuclear reactor.
2478000	2480000	Numerous patents for such machines were designed
2480000	2484000	by Los Alamos National Laboratories in the 1970s,
2484000	2488000	and don't worry, we will fully dive into this in the dumb video.
2488000	2491000	Boylan had reportedly witnessed this craft in test flight
2491000	2494000	over Area 51 in the Northrop complex near Edwards,
2494000	2497000	dubbing it Northrop's Great Pumpkin Disk.
2497000	2501000	These two siding locations are another fascinating connection to EDD,
2501000	2505000	and the joint reverse engineering effort between Edwards,
2505000	2507000	contractors, and Area 51.
2507000	2511000	Wilson made additional mentions to a reverse engineered craft
2511000	2516000	designated the XH-75D, or the XH Shark.
2516000	2519000	This craft is allegedly an anti-gravity helicopter
2519000	2522000	designed by Teledyne Ryan San Diego Division.
2522000	2525000	Wilson claimed these craft were assigned to Delta IV
2525000	2529000	slash the NRO for UFO crash retrievals.
2529000	2533000	This mention of NRO and Delta is indeed intriguing.
2533000	2537000	Delta Force, part of the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC,
2537000	2541000	has been accused of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals
2541000	2546000	under the CIA Office of Global Access, as has indeed the NRO.
2546000	2550000	In fact, the NRO was one of two intelligence agencies,
2550000	2553000	the other being the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
2553000	2555000	we discussed above with C4ISR.
2555000	2559000	David Grush worked on as liaison to the UAP Task Force,
2559000	2563000	where he discovered the existence of UAP legacy programs.
2563000	2567000	The NRO was also one of three intelligence agencies
2567000	2571000	alongside the CIA and NSA mentioned by Edgar Fuchet
2571000	2574000	as managing the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle.
2574000	2577000	Very little has been discussed on this craft,
2577000	2581000	the XH-75D, original drawing by Wilson on screen now.
2581000	2584000	And almost no actionable investigation can arise
2584000	2587000	from Wilson's incredibly brief testimony on this craft.
2587000	2590000	The Colonel never discussed the intended application
2590000	2594000	or function of the onboard anti-gravity system.
2594000	2598000	What I do find interesting is a 2019 design concept
2598000	2601000	created by one of Lockheed Martin's subsidiaries,
2601000	2604000	the Sikorsky Raider X.
2604000	2606000	Dual rotor helicopters are not rare.
2606000	2609000	They are often implemented on helicopters designed for heavy lift.
2609000	2614000	One would have to ask why the XH-75D would need dual rotors
2614000	2616000	with an anti-gravity system.
2616000	2618000	But the Raider X, canceled in 24,
2618000	2620000	sought to create a quote,
2620000	2623000	agile, survivable compound coaxial helicopter
2623000	2625000	that will equip future aviators to address
2625000	2627000	evolving peer and near-peer threats
2627000	2630000	in the most difficult environments, end quote.
2630000	2634000	No further linkages beyond design exist between these platforms.
2634000	2637000	However, I do find it interesting the XH-75D,
2637000	2639000	drawn by Wilson in 97,
2639000	2642000	looks almost identical to the concept craft
2642000	2644000	proposed by Lockheed in 2019.
2644000	2647000	So is the anti-gravity disk in helicopter
2647000	2649000	proposed by Wilson real?
2649000	2652000	Well, this is unfortunately a dead end of investigation.
2652000	2655000	As I said, Wilson's testimony must be considered
2655000	2657000	little more than third-party research.
2657000	2659000	Because while it is fascinating
2659000	2662000	and ties intimately to some claims made regarding
2662000	2665000	UAP Legacy Recovery programs throughout history,
2665000	2668000	there is little evidence or actionable data to pursue.
2668000	2671000	I would, however, like to leave discussion of Wilson
2671000	2673000	with a chart he made regarding the structure
2673000	2675000	of UAP Legacy programs.
2675000	2678000	Please note, the rendition I am showing now
2678000	2682000	is a recreation of Wilson's 97 chart published in 2001.
2682000	2685000	Numerous spelling errors can be observed here,
2685000	2687000	such as in Lockheed.
2687000	2689000	This chart is titled Star Wars City
2689000	2692000	in reference to the Strategic Defense Initiative,
2692000	2694000	the program we mentioned above,
2694000	2697000	and a program I have discussed many times,
2697000	2699000	instituted by Reagan in the 1980s
2699000	2702000	with possible ties to Eisenhower.
2702000	2705000	To state again, the SDI program instituted to protect
2705000	2708000	the United States from ballistic nuclear attacks
2708000	2710000	has been referenced by numerous witnesses
2710000	2713000	who have stated the program had a backdoor functionality
2713000	2716000	to act offensively against UAP
2716000	2720000	and back-channeled funds to fund UFO Legacy programs.
2720000	2722000	From the chart, Star Wars City
2722000	2724000	located under the Cheyenne Mountain Complex
2724000	2726000	in Colorado Springs, Colorado,
2726000	2729000	oversees the U.S. Space Counterintelligence Headquarters
2729000	2734000	within the SDI as the nexus of UAP Legacy programs.
2734000	2737000	Within this chart, there are numerous institutions
2737000	2740000	one might expect to be associated with UAP retrieval
2740000	2742000	and exploitation programs, the NRO,
2742000	2745000	National Security Council, National Security Agency,
2745000	2748000	CIA, NORAD, and Majestic 12.
2748000	2752000	Adhering to the SDI, Colorado HQ, and Magi,
2752000	2754000	there exists a list of contractors
2754000	2757000	alleged to engage with the UAP portfolio.
2757000	2760000	Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed,
2760000	2764000	Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and IBM are mentioned.
2764000	2767000	We also find Decision Science Applications Inc.
2767000	2770000	DSAI was led by former Admiral
2770000	2773000	and recurring character of this project, Bobby Ray Inman,
2773000	2777000	and most likely had its assets handed over to SAIC.
2777000	2781000	A contractor I believe is as involved in legacy operations
2781000	2783000	as Northrop or Lockheed.
2783000	2785000	Another project for another day,
2785000	2789000	as DSAI is quite a worthy investigation.
2789000	2792000	DSI, according to the chart and Wilson's testimony,
2792000	2796000	consists of directors of relevant UAP black budget divisions
2796000	2798000	from the aforementioned contractors,
2798000	2801000	as well as Ford Aerospace, which is now part of Northrop Grumman,
2801000	2803000	and Teledyne Ryan,
2803000	2806000	which was one of Northrop's premium purchases.
2806000	2809000	When Teledyne Ryan did indeed play a vital role
2809000	2811000	in the Strategic Defense Initiative,
2811000	2813000	the contractor was well regarded for designing
2813000	2816000	and producing high-performance aerial targets,
2816000	2819000	which were crucial for testing and evaluation potential
2819000	2821000	for missile defense systems,
2821000	2823000	as well as developing advanced sensors
2823000	2825000	that could be used for detecting and tracking
2825000	2827000	incoming ballistic missiles.
2827000	2829000	TRW, Northrop's crown jewel,
2829000	2831000	additionally aided in the SDI program,
2831000	2833000	such as using its locations
2833000	2835000	for high-powered chemical laser testing.
2835000	2837000	And as we mentioned above,
2837000	2840000	Northrop itself takes great pride in aiding in the SDI program
2840000	2844000	in 1983, creating the first laser radar used in space.
2844000	2847000	It is fascinating, even in a testimony like Wilson's,
2847000	2850000	we can still find links to Northrop's many acquisitions
2850000	2852000	and UAP legacy programs.
2852000	2856000	And now onto a whistleblower by the acronym of A-H
2856000	2860000	that appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.
2860000	2863000	And I must state again, regarding Greer's witnesses,
2863000	2866000	let us analyze the quality and claims of the whistleblower
2866000	2868000	instead of the platform.
2868000	2871000	Unfortunately, Greer's poor operational security
2871000	2874000	is ever-present, as clips of A-H are listed
2874000	2877000	in the DPI archive as Arnold House.
2877000	2879000	I believe I have located this individual
2879000	2881000	and have reached out to talk to him.
2881000	2883000	I have heard nothing.
2883000	2886000	Arnold's testimony revolves around the significant information
2886000	2888000	he gained regarding UAP programs
2888000	2892000	while a surface technician at the Boeing Aerospace Company,
2892000	2896000	as well as insights gained from friend and four-star general,
2896000	2898000	Curtis LeMay.
2898000	2900000	As we dive in, it is crucial to maintain awareness
2900000	2903000	how his disclosures are indeed secondhand.
2903000	2905000	As far as his testimony,
2905000	2908000	House never participated directly in program operations.
2908000	2911000	His information was handed to him from friends at NSA,
2911000	2914000	CIA, NASA, JPL,
2914000	2916000	Office of Naval Intelligence Area 51,
2916000	2920000	USAF, Northrop, Boeing, and various generals.
2920000	2923000	This information was so complete, according to Greer,
2923000	2926000	House briefed Bill Clinton in 1990.
2926000	2929000	I have no evidence to confirm this briefing.
2929000	2932000	The only possible link I can find is a letter to Clinton from Greer
2932000	2934000	marked 9 July 2000,
2934000	2937000	where Greer requested the city president to disclose
2937000	2941000	UFO-related USAPs at the suggestion of their mutual friend.
2941000	2944000	I do find House very worthy of discussion
2944000	2947000	as we can find correspondences with him and Greer
2947000	2952000	as recently as 2018 and as old as December 2000.
2952000	2954000	Perhaps House, like William Hamilton,
2954000	2957000	has served as one of Greer's primary sources of information
2957000	2959000	over the decades.
2959000	2961000	In his taped testimony linked in description,
2961000	2964000	House stated one day around 1987
2964000	2966000	at the home of General Curtis LeMay,
2966000	2970000	the infamous general confirmed the Roswell, New Mexico crash.
2970000	2973000	House also learned from his NSA friend that Henry Kissinger,
2973000	2976000	George Bush, as well as Ronald Reagan
2976000	2979000	and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the UAP subject.
2979000	2982000	His friends in CIA relayed to House
2982000	2986000	that they, along with USAF, had downed NHI craft.
2986000	2989000	Arnold even claimed he learned from a friend in the FBI
2989000	2992000	that the Bureau had radar testing that was causing interference
2992000	2995000	with some of the craft resulting in crashes.
2995000	2998000	This echoes Lieutenant Colonel Corso's sentiments
2998000	3001000	regarding the crash of the Roswell, New Mexico craft.
3001000	3005000	House also learned and relayed there are underground bases
3005000	3008000	testing and maintaining TUOs,
3008000	3010000	likely Dugway, Palmdale, California,
3010000	3013000	Edwards Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and others.
3013000	3017000	Interesting we see Palmdale and Edwards pop up once again.
3017000	3020000	But now let's focus directly on Arnold's information
3020000	3022000	regarding Northrop.
3022000	3025000	House's entire testimony could lead to an entire video
3025000	3028000	so maybe we will save that for whistleblowers volume 3.
3028000	3031000	A.H. stated while at Boeing he met a man
3031000	3034000	in the Army Criminal Investigation Division, CID,
3034000	3038000	who was involved in several crash recovery since 1947
3038000	3043000	and had served in Army CIC, Counter Intelligence Corps, Capacity.
3043000	3045000	The gentleman handpicked one of House's friends
3045000	3048000	at the Boeing aircraft company to become part of a UFO
3048000	3052000	crash recovery team in northern New Mexico starting in 1980.
3052000	3055000	This friend of A.H. would somehow relay information
3055000	3058000	regarding his time in legacy program operations
3058000	3062000	from 1980 to 1997, 17 years.
3062000	3065000	The time of these disclosures is not given, however,
3065000	3067000	as investigators we must assume that his friend
3067000	3071000	informed Arnold after leaving program operations in 1997.
3071000	3074000	House's friend was ultimately stationed and helped
3074000	3076000	with reverse engineering efforts and testing
3076000	3079000	of non-human craft at Area 51.
3079000	3083000	He was not working for the U.S. government or military, however.
3083000	3086000	His paychecks during these years in legacy programs
3086000	3088000	came directly from Northrop.
3088000	3091000	The source would illustrate Northrop, Lockheed Martin,
3091000	3094000	and Boeing all engaged in UFO reverse engineering efforts
3094000	3096000	at Area 51.
3096000	3099000	The facility itself from 1980 to 1997
3099000	3102000	held a tremendous amount of extraterrestrial debris
3102000	3104000	in a containment area.
3104000	3107000	This source would also tell House some of the program
3107000	3109000	was shifted to a location in Utah,
3109000	3112000	likely dugway-proving grounds.
3112000	3115000	They moved most of the stuff from Area 51,
3115000	3120000	at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.
3121000	3124000	Just basically those companies and of course,
3124000	3126000	Lockheed and Northrop.
3126000	3129000	This is very interesting as USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
3129000	3131000	said the exact same thing.
3131000	3135000	Some Area 51 legacy programs were relocated to dugway
3135000	3137000	in the early 1990s.
3137000	3140000	I myself have talked about dugway previously
3140000	3142000	and plan to revisit with a contractor witness
3142000	3146000	who claimed to stumble upon a floating saucer craft
3146000	3149000	within a classified testing area on base.
3149000	3152000	Here is where House's testimony regarding Area 51
3152000	3155000	and Northrop gets really interesting.
3155000	3158000	This same friend told Arnold the A51 program
3158000	3161000	to test NHI vehicles and exploit technological materials
3161000	3164000	was called Project Red Light.
3164000	3170000	There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area
3170000	3174000	and near, this is very funny, it's near Northrop.
3174000	3177000	There's an underground area out there too
3177000	3181000	that he was aware of, but he particularly mentioned
3181000	3185000	and stayed focused on ANZA, California.
3185000	3187000	There's some underground areas up there too
3187000	3191000	that they're researching some of this technology
3191000	3196000	and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.
3196000	3199000	This should immediately become familiar to many of my viewers
3199000	3201000	as I have referenced this Project Red Light
3201000	3203000	on numerous occasions.
3203000	3205000	I have traced first mention of this project
3205000	3208000	to the files of the late legendary researcher
3208000	3211000	Leonard Stringfield, author of Crash Retrieval Status Reports
3211000	3215000	1-7 and relayed by excellent researcher Michael Schrat.
3215000	3218000	In a letter dated April 5th, 1980,
3218000	3222000	one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one MH,
3222000	3225000	a witness identity Schrat chose not to disclose.
3225000	3228000	MH allegedly performed radio maintenance
3228000	3233000	at the atomic proving grounds in Nevada during 1961 to 1963,
3233000	3236000	along with top secret radio work for USAF.
3236000	3240000	According to MH, he participated in a top secret operation
3240000	3244000	at Area 51 titled Project Red Light.
3244000	3246000	Test flights were conducted under this project
3246000	3251000	on a recovered UFO shipped from none other than Edwards Air Force Base.
3251000	3253000	The craft was not conventionally powered
3253000	3255000	and stayed silent during operation.
3255000	3257000	Security was so tight on the project,
3257000	3260000	program personnel were rotated every six months.
3260000	3263000	MH claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast
3263000	3266000	American defense contractor encountering difficulties
3266000	3270000	in reverse engineering many of the components comprising the craft.
3270000	3273000	I have drawn a parallel between Red Light and the testimony of Ed.
3273000	3276000	We have referenced numerous times throughout this project,
3276000	3280000	a joint Edwards Area 51 reverse engineering program
3280000	3282000	out of the Edwards 412th Test Group.
3282000	3285000	Well, Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
3285000	3287000	additionally mentioned Project Red Light.
3288000	3290000	Fouchet claimed he gathered knowledge
3290000	3294000	defense contractor EGNG was awarded an indefinite contract
3294000	3298000	for Project Red Light to support the DOE and military.
3298000	3300000	If you have not heard of EGNG,
3300000	3304000	this is the contractor historically implicated with UAP programs
3304000	3307000	made infamous in the story of Bob Lazar
3307000	3311000	as the contractor that hired him to work out of Site 4.
3311000	3314000	This contract gave EGNG responsibility
3314000	3318000	to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps
3318000	3320000	and to provide aerial and ground security
3320000	3323000	for highly classified government and military sites.
3323000	3325000	If the testimony of Arnold House
3325000	3328000	and his legacy program connections are indeed true,
3328000	3330000	Northrop Grumman could have indeed served
3330000	3333000	as a project manager for Project Red Light,
3333000	3336000	testing non-human intelligence and alien reproduction vehicles
3336000	3340000	in a joint contractor Edwards 412th Test Group operation.
3340000	3344000	Absolutely incredible links to ponder.
3371000	3374000	We have no project stork,
3374000	3379000	we have no direct mention of Lockheed and so forth
3379000	3382000	but almost in a way I find that a little more intriguing
3382000	3383000	for my research.
3383000	3386000	With Northrop we devoted so much time
3386000	3390000	to look specifically at Northrop Grumman's acquisitions
3390000	3393000	TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM,
3393000	3396000	connections to Aerospace Corporation and FFRDCs
3396000	3400000	and I find this so fascinating how
3400000	3404000	Northrop's involvement outside of mentions of Fuchshe
3404000	3406000	and a couple other mentions here and there
3406000	3409000	and comments from Jack Northrop at the beginning of the video
3409000	3412000	they seem to purchase up buy-up companies
3412000	3415000	that had legacy operations.
3415000	3418000	TRW and its implication in the Wilson Davis Memo
3418000	3422000	and the Phil Pentagon audit that almost outed the senior review group.
3422000	3425000	$200 million today Northrop paid
3425000	3427000	to settle that lawsuit for TRW.
3427000	3430000	Now they acquired them I believe for $6 or $7 billion
3430000	3431000	that's a drop in the bucket
3431000	3434000	but it's interesting that a year after the acquisition
3434000	3436000	Northrop's still okay with you know what TRW
3436000	3438000	you're implicated in this massive lawsuit
3438000	3440000	but don't worry we'll pay for it.
3440000	3444000	So I find that sort of research absolutely
3444000	3447000	scintillating instead of just direct confirmations
3447000	3451000	and direct ties like we had with Lockheed and Battelle.
3451000	3454000	I also find all of the whistleblower testimony
3454000	3456000	of Northrop to be incredibly fast
3456000	3458000	and you know I wouldn't be
3458000	3461000	surprised to see full projects on Steve Wilson
3461000	3463000	and Arnold Howe soon.
3463000	3466000	Like I mentioned I've tried to connect with House
3466000	3468000	because I do believe with a high degree of certainty
3468000	3470000	I have found that individual
3470000	3472000	and Colonel or yeah,
3472000	3474000	Colonel Steve Wilson is no longer with us
3474000	3476000	he passed in 1997
3476000	3479000	but his testimony is still shrouded in mystery
3479000	3482000	and his legitimacy in USAF
3482000	3484000	is still surrounded in mystery
3484000	3485000	so a lot more to explore there
3485000	3487000	but I find it really interesting
3487000	3489000	from the work of William Hamilton
3489000	3491000	the testimony of AH
3491000	3495000	that there's still these little comments
3495000	3497000	that are ubiquitous around testimony
3497000	3500000	that I still find to be quite accurate
3500000	3502000	mentions of the SDI
3502000	3504000	and UAP Legacy programs mentioned
3504000	3507000	Northrop's involvement in underground facilities
3507000	3509000	mention of underground facilities
3509000	3512000	mentioning you know dating to Fouché as well
3512000	3514000	projects being moved from Area 51
3514000	3516000	to Dugway Proving Grounds
3516000	3518000	even mentions of Area 51 in Edwards
3518000	3520000	as we see in Arnold Howe's
3520000	3522000	Red Light, Fouché, etc.
3522000	3524000	So the question must be asked
3524000	3526000	why is Northrop's involvement
3526000	3528000	in Legacy programs operations
3528000	3530000	so shrouded
3530000	3532000	why do they pass under the radar
3532000	3535000	alongside companies like Boeing and Raytheon
3535000	3537000	while Lockheed Martin, while Battelle
3537000	3540000	these guys, I mean even General Electric
3540000	3542000	to a certain degree are always labeled
3542000	3544000	as the prime contractors
3544000	3546000	well I do have someone of a thesis there
3546000	3548000	I think Battelle
3548000	3550000	bar biological storage
3550000	3553000	at probably Fort Detrick or Fort Belbois
3553000	3555000	is a little bit out of the game
3555000	3557000	they're a little bit said and done
3557000	3559000	I think the three, four primary players
3559000	3560000	if we want to say
3560000	3562000	are Lockheed Boeing
3562000	3564000	who is likely a project manager
3564000	3566000	for operations
3566000	3568000	Northrop and Raytheon
3568000	3570000	I think these are the big guys
3570000	3572000	I think that
3572000	3574000	Lockheed is sort of like
3574000	3576000	a hound dog
3576000	3578000	Lockheed will respond to a beck and call
3578000	3580000	they will do what is required of them
3580000	3582000	they are the loudest in the room
3582000	3584000	etc. I think Lockheed
3584000	3586000	is
3586000	3588000	they will take advantage of a situation
3588000	3590000	and they are opportunists
3590000	3592000	the reason I say this is the
3592000	3594000	2008 material transfer to OSAP
3594000	3596000	that was blocked by Glenn Gaffney
3596000	3598000	in the CIA
3598000	3600000	directorate of science and technology
3600000	3602000	Lockheed itself
3602000	3604000	offered to divest itself of materials
3604000	3606000	now was this
3606000	3608000	to get in the good graces
3608000	3610000	of the CIA
3610000	3612000	the OGA, the DS&T
3612000	3614000	the NRO probably
3614000	3616000	did Lockheed give up
3616000	3618000	materials they could reverse engineer
3618000	3620000	Lockheed give away materials they think
3620000	3622000	that any other
3622000	3624000	corporation or agency
3624000	3626000	could reverse engineer
3626000	3628000	and garner insights from probably not
3628000	3630000	this was probably materials they thought
3630000	3632000	well if we can't figure it out no one else can
3632000	3634000	so we might as well
3634000	3636000	get in good favor with some people
3636000	3638000	and get rid of these materials
3638000	3640000	which is likely from the 1953 Kigman, Arizona crash
3640000	3642000	but that's a whole other conversation
3642000	3644000	Northrop
3644000	3646000	their work seems to be shrouded
3646000	3648000	in much more secrecy
3648000	3650000	they are not offering to divest themselves
3650000	3652000	of material they are often seen in the shadows
3652000	3654000	they are often tag-lined
3654000	3656000	in testimonies like Fouche's
3656000	3658000	as the
3658000	3660000	person in the shadows
3660000	3662000	so that makes the question
3662000	3664000	what work are they doing
3664000	3666000	well I believe it's material exploitation
3666000	3668000	reverse engineering and testing of ARV
3668000	3670000	and likely project
3670000	3672000	managerial responsibilities
3672000	3674000	for the red light project if that is still ongoing
3674000	3676000	or if that has shifted since Ed's time
3676000	3678000	around
3678000	3680000	Nellis and Edwards
3680000	3682000	ending in about 2006 to 2008
3682000	3684000	so if that project is still ongoing
3684000	3686000	I think that Lockheed operates
3686000	3688000	similar to
3688000	3690000	and I forgot one on the Mount Rushmore of Legacy
3690000	3692000	operations SAIC
3692000	3694000	I think Northrop
3694000	3696000	alongside Lockheed alongside SAIC
3696000	3698000	Boeing and perhaps Raytheon
3698000	3700000	they operate across all segments
3700000	3702000	of US military have commented numerous times
3702000	3704000	that
3704000	3706000	the Army, the Air Force
3706000	3708000	and the Navy
3708000	3710000	their programs are extremely compartmentalized
3710000	3712000	stove piped as Eric Davis said
3712000	3714000	and don't really have much interaction with each other
3714000	3716000	the common threads here are the contractors
3716000	3718000	that interact
3718000	3720000	in programs across compartments
3720000	3722000	and possibly the UARCs
3722000	3724000	and FFRDCs that do as well
3724000	3726000	there might be some
3726000	3728000	small contractors that help out
3728000	3730000	with Air Force responsibilities
3730000	3732000	and one such company might be
3732000	3734000	Alien Science and Technologies
3734000	3736000	helping Ed
3736000	3738000	and the project red light
3738000	3740000	if you want to call it that out at Edwards
3740000	3742000	but the project managers
3742000	3744000	the companies that seem to do quite a bit
3744000	3746000	then engage in all facets
3746000	3748000	of legacy program operations
3748000	3750000	operate across all of these boards
3750000	3752000	so is Northrop still
3752000	3754000	ongoing in research I would probably say
3754000	3756000	yes and Northrop has
3756000	3758000	is up to their eyeballs just like SAIC
3758000	3760000	like Lockheed and just like Boeing
3760000	3762000	but these are my personal opinions
3762000	3764000	I think that even though much of the research
3764000	3766000	we have studied today is still
3766000	3768000	whistleblower testimony and
3768000	3770000	a bit nebulous at some points
3770000	3772000	like Steve Wilson
3772000	3774000	I still think there are numerous fascinating ties
3774000	3776000	I mean
3776000	3778000	again I want to harken back
3778000	3780000	to Northrop's many acquisitions
3780000	3782000	and even date that back to Sparey Rand
3782000	3784000	when it went defunct
3784000	3786000	its departments going to Northrop Grumman
3786000	3788000	and Lockheed and others
3788000	3790000	and connections to the Corso testimony
3790000	3792000	all of these neat little threads
3792000	3794000	that kind of tie Northrop
3794000	3796000	and its purchasing streak interwoven
3796000	3798000	into stories of legacy
3798000	3800000	program operations it's very fascinating
3800000	3802000	in a sense this project was
3802000	3804000	almost a little bit more conclusive to me
3804000	3806000	than even Lockheed or Battelle
3806000	3808000	I would like to know what everybody else here thinks
3810000	3812000	you know perhaps Northrop silence
3812000	3814000	is a sign of danger
3814000	3816000	we don't know all we can do is continue
3816000	3818000	to investigate and if you have any other
3818000	3820000	insights into Northrop
3820000	3822000	or testimony I would love to hear from
3822000	3824000	you and to tell me what you think in the comments
3824000	3826000	with that guys we will move on
3826000	3828000	because I think I've been ranting out for about
3828000	3830000	8 minutes please remember
3830000	3832000	to like and subscribe
3832000	3834000	always look forward to the next project
3834000	3836000	we'll get back in live
3836000	3838000	soon because I would like to talk
3838000	3840000	a little bit about concurring
3840000	3842000	events you know with the whistleblower
3842000	3844000	testimony of Jake Barber
3844000	3846000	Dr. John Blitch
3846000	3848000	Don Paul Bales
3848000	3850000	and so forth and Fred Baker
3850000	3852000	but I don't want to make that my channel
3852000	3854000	I'm not a news of the day type of guy
3854000	3856000	as you all know you know there's a lot
3856000	3858000	of space between the videos so we'll figure
3858000	3860000	out something there so please remember to like
3860000	3862000	and subscribe guys I do have a patreon
3862000	3864000	you can find that on the channel page
3864000	3866000	I don't gate keep content all of my
3866000	3868000	research as everybody knows is open source
3868000	3870000	so only support what
3870000	3872000	you think the channel is worth
3872000	3874000	you're not getting much extra there it's just
3874000	3876000	go help me out make these investigations
3876000	3878000	purchasing better camera equipment because
3878000	3880000	as everybody can see this camera isn't great
3880000	3882000	and you know maybe funding
3882000	3884000	my trips to go speak to witnesses
3884000	3886000	which I do plan to do quite soon so
3886000	3888000	thank you so much again for joining me and
3888000	3890000	I will catch everybody on the next show
3890000	3892000	later everybody thanks
