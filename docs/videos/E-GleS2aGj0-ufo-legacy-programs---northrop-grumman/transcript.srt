1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
The propulsion of these UFOs is unique,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,860
their ability to hover,

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,960
their ability to accelerate very rapidly,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,400
their ability to move at very high speeds,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,160
very much higher than anything that we have achieved,

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,180
even with our supersonic aircraft.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,420
All of these things, and particularly interestingly,

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,520
without sonic booms and the things that we don't

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,400
like about our supersonic aircraft,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,360
all of these things indicate a type of propulsion,

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,640
which is unique.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,800
Different than anything we know anything about,

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,560
and which would be a tremendous value

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
if we could develop it and use it.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
That's the reason I feel with a number of others

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,440
who have studied it, that it is a subject

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,120
which deserves the highest type of scientific study

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,400
and at an early date.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,320
The advantages to be gained are perfectly enormous.

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,720
And how long do you feel it will be

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,380
before we are flying in UFOs?

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,440
Well, this probably is a $64 question

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,360
without a question without.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I think it depends, a great deal,

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,120
on how rapidly we take them seriously

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,280
and how soon we really set up

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,000
a scientific study team to work on the subject.

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,520
This is where we push the laws of physics.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,480
You see, the technology we make

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,840
is what makes the impossible possible.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,880
And it doesn't stop there.

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,440
So far on this channel,

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,920
we have devoted entire investigations

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,720
towards Battelle Memorial Institute

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
and their possible work on shape memory alloys

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,680
recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
as well as Lockheed Martin

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,480
and their intimate decades long involvement

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,720
in UFO legacy programs.

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,640
After all, high profile US defense contractors

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,880
have for decades been accused of actively engaging

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
in material exploitation

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,480
and reverse engineering programs,

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,120
focused on technologies of unknown origin

45
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,080
in conjunction with various factions

46
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,440
within US government intelligence and military.

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
Overall, you know, the government

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,920
has been the custodian of a lot of this, right?

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
And they'll hand recede it out

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,520
to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,480
which I find highly unethical.

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,600
You have basically a sole source arrangement

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,600
and you allow certain private corporate elements

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,680
to look at this, develop a potential insight

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,880
and then sell it back to the government for profit.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,000
And I think that's totally unethical.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,120
Lockheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work,

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,760
both in our atmosphere, in space, and even underwater.

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,760
There are certain efforts to...

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
It's a tough question you ask.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,560
I left the Air Force and was sent out to California

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,760
at that time to begin establishing my cover basis

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,120
as an independent contractor

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,640
so that I can serve what was coming down the line next for me.

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,640
And that is the path which led to the UAP subject.

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,240
These claims are not without merit

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
as since the inception

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
of the US military industrial complex,

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,080
private defense industry has worked in tandem

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,920
with military and intelligence

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,080
to bolster US military might

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,720
protected by waived, unacknowledged special access programs.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,200
I have directly accused Lockheed Martin,

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,560
Patel, Boeing, SAIC, and many other private institutions

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
and semi-private institutions,

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
such as UARCs and FFRDCs possessing, experimenting with

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
and possibly successfully harnessing

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,240
non-human technologies.

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,720
Today, we focus our sights towards the US Aerospace

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,200
and Defense Colossus and father of the B-2 stealth bomber,

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,080
Northrop Grumman, often overshadowed

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,600
by the infamy of Lockheed

83
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,200
and their involvement in the 2008 failed attempt

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,120
to divest recovered NHI materials to the OSAP program.

85
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,600
Northrop Grumman has largely successfully distanced itself

86
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
from the spotlight of defense contractors

87
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,680
engaging with UAP legacy programs.

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,320
In fact, focused discussion

89
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,800
on the alien reproduction vehicle, Fluxliner,

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,440
as relayed by Brad Sorensen

91
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,080
and the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,120
discussed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

93
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,440
seemed to primarily focus on Lockheed.

94
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,920
These testimonies highlight the defense contractor

95
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,640
successfully reverse engineering non-human craft

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,600
to operate under human control.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
But throughout such disclosures,

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,120
Lockheed isn't the sole contractor accused

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,360
of such highly classified efforts.

100
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,640
Hardly mentioned, but always alongside in the shadows

101
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
is Northrop Grumman.

102
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
Could Northrop Grumman truly be involved

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,040
in material exploitation of technologies

104
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,460
of unknown origin, TUOs?

105
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,340
Just how far does their involvement with UFO studies go?

106
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Join me today as we peer into the shadows to find out.

107
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,900
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb

108
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,660
and thank you so much for joining me

109
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,660
as we touch back to UFOs in the private sector.

110
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,580
This time to Northrop Grumman.

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,300
The contractor I believe alongside Lockheed

112
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,940
is the Paramount Aerospace Corporation

113
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,860
entrenched in UFO legacy programs.

114
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,260
From whistleblower testimony to analysis

115
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,220
of Northrop's numerous acquisitions over the decades,

116
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,300
let's thoroughly dive into the legendary Northrop Grumman

117
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,700
and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,260
Let's start by analyzing the history of Northrop

119
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,540
and its many, many, many acquisitions over the decades.

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,940
Northrop Grumman is an American aerospace

121
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,060
and defense company employing over 95,000 employees

122
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,020
with an annual revenue of $30 billion.

123
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,340
The industry giant has achieved extraordinary engineering

124
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,180
feat such as aiding in the development

125
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,060
of the James Webb Space Telescope

126
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,660
and directly creating the B-2 Spirit Bomber and B-21 Raider,

127
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,340
the world's only known stealth bombers.

128
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,260
Northrop Grumman operates in four major divisions,

129
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,300
aeronautics, defense, space and mission systems,

130
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
outside of military aircraft,

131
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,020
space systems and weapon development.

132
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,500
Northrop also engages in cyber security,

133
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,100
information technology and radar and sensor systems.

134
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,780
Briefly, I do take an extreme interest

135
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,220
in Northrop's C-4 ISR, Command Control,

136
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,540
Communications, Computers, Intelligence,

137
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,460
Surveillance and Reconnaissance,

138
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,540
which falls under Northrop's land-based

139
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,300
critical technology services,

140
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,180
sustainment and modernization.

141
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,060
C-4 ISR is essentially the military's nervous system

142
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,620
consisting of various electronic equipment and technologies

143
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,500
serving to aid the modern warfighter

144
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,380
through data and intelligence.

145
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,220
I am currently working on a thesis

146
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,420
that select contractor C-4 ISR programs

147
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,260
engage in deep-six waved USAPs for crash retrieval

148
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,300
and ARV testing, data and analysis, let me explain.

149
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,740
Northrop was one of the premier contractors

150
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,340
operating C-4 ISR for the Strategic Defense Initiative

151
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,100
instituted under Reagan in 1983.

152
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,340
Northrop created the first laser radar

153
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,220
used in space for SDI.

154
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,900
I have discussed numerous times lines of research

155
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,460
which state SDI focused on Soviet ICBM nuclear defense,

156
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,500
secretly studied and employed offensive capabilities

157
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,780
against UAP and siphoned program funds

158
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,620
to UAP legacy programs such as the DARS,

159
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,420
Defense Advanced Research Center,

160
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,100
proposed to exist in an ARPA document.

161
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,700
SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation,

162
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,820
frequently secures massive hundreds of million dollar

163
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,980
contracts for C-4 ISR

164
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,700
at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.

165
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,860
I have published extensive research,

166
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,980
SAIC runs an off-world technologies division

167
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,100
to house recovered NHI artifacts at the Crane Naval location.

168
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,580
When discussing witness Ed in the existence

169
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,660
of a joint ARV testing program

170
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,180
out of Edwards Air Force Base in Area 51

171
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,140
under the Edwards 412 test group,

172
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,980
I made reference to a Lockheed Martin ISR case study.

173
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,780
In this study, Lockheed was tasked

174
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,740
with updating the system used by USAF Warfare Center

175
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,540
for Intelligence Collection and Data Processing.

176
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,820
Lockheed reconfigured a two phase security classification

177
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,700
system used by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.

178
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,300
Yes, the same agency Grush was a part of

179
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,700
when liaison to the UAP task force

180
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,860
and the same agency recently mentioned

181
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,220
by respected journalist Chris Sharp

182
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,060
as participating in undersea UAP crash retrievals.

183
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,500
The system was implemented to the combined air

184
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,420
and space operation center at Nellis Air Force Base,

185
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,620
which is tasked with processing information

186
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,500
for exploitation of time sensitive targets.

187
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,100
At the time I speculated,

188
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,740
although this Lockheed project arose from challenges

189
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,700
in the Nellis Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training Exercise,

190
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,780
could such systems be used to monitor UAP

191
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,860
and UAP crash retrievals?

192
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,060
Although C4 ISR is common

193
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,020
and the nervous system of the armed forces,

194
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,660
I do think analyzing Defense Corporation's

195
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,980
C4 ISR contracts and projects with USAF Army

196
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,220
and Navy can lead to knocking on the door

197
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,780
of UAP program operations.

198
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,140
And after that long discussion,

199
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,860
finally back to the history of Northrop Grumman.

200
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,500
NG arose from the merging of two military aircraft companies,

201
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Company

202
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,100
and the Northrop Company in 1994.

203
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,780
Throughout its storied history,

204
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,260
Northrop made a few very key acquisitions.

205
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,700
We will continue to reference over and over

206
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,660
again throughout this project.

207
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,780
One such acquisition occurred in 1999

208
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,060
with procurement of Teledyne Ryan,

209
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,260
developer of surveillance systems at unmanned aircraft.

210
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,060
In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc,

211
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,940
a corporation involved in aerospace, electronics

212
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,980
and the automotive industries.

213
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,380
Outside of computers, systems engineering,

214
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,780
integrated circuits, TRW was a true trailblazer

215
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,300
in spacecraft construction,

216
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,020
building pioneer one, 10 and numerous

217
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,740
space-based observatories.

218
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,980
The defense giant considered TRW,

219
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,340
its quote unquote capstone acquisition

220
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,260
signaling the end to Northrop Grumman's

221
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,220
aggressive purchasing streak.

222
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,780
Why was TRW considered the crown jewel

223
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,100
of Northrop's purchases?

224
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,820
While there is evidence to suggest

225
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,580
this was due to TRW operating a portfolio

226
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,620
of UAP legacy programs upon purchase.

227
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,780
Lengthy investigation must be done

228
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,260
to discover the UFO program portfolio

229
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,020
Northrop may have inherited from TRW.

230
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,220
TRW has long been associated

231
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,100
with a rumored crash retrieval program

232
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,220
run out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,

233
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,660
a topic even touched on by Lou Elizondo

234
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,180
in his book Eminent.

235
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,780
And let's mention that in June of 1960,

236
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,820
TRW spawned the Aerospace Corporation.

237
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,220
The Aerospace Corporation has additionally

238
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,820
been implicated in UFO legacy programs

239
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,740
and served as a place for employment

240
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,580
for OSAP physicist and member

241
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,740
of the Wilson Davis meeting Dr. Eric Davis.

242
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I would additionally like to draw attention

243
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,660
to the year the Aerospace Corporation was founded in 1960

244
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,740
and relate this founding to the testimony

245
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,540
of Lieutenant Colonel Philip J. Corso.

246
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,220
Corso stated 1958 to 1962 oversaw

247
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,580
the golden age of U.S. Army R&D

248
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,260
where Army assets, universities, laboratories,

249
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,980
and private industry were leveraged

250
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,420
to reverse engineer non-human technology

251
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,540
to bolster the U.S. war machine.

252
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,980
Analyzing Army primers from around this time

253
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,580
highlight a period of massive innovation

254
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,580
in Army research and development.

255
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,620
The MITRE Corporation was born during this time in 1959

256
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,220
with lines of research to suggest its formation

257
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,060
was to engage in such research and development projects

258
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,580
alongside Bell Labs, Sperry Rand, et cetera.

259
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,020
The Aerospace Corporation founded just one year post-MITRE,

260
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,580
maybe one additional corporation spawned from TRW

261
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,260
for U.S. Army legacy operations.

262
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,780
And worthy to note, both MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation

263
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,900
are both known as FFRDCs,

264
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,780
federally funded research and development centers.

265
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,460
Present day, the Aerospace Corporation manages

266
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,620
the Aerospace FFRDC for the Department of Defense

267
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,340
and Air Force to support, quote,

268
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,140
national security space programs, end quote.

269
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,220
We are truly the only space enterprise

270
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,380
that exists in the United States.

271
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,060
And I mean this at the agency level in the government,

272
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,820
the FFRDCs in private industry.

273
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,660
There is no other organization

274
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,060
that does national security space, civil and commercial,

275
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,700
and international as well,

276
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,620
that ties these all together with both the breadth

277
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,260
and the depth that we bring to this problem.

278
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,460
I have spoken at length about FFRDCs,

279
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,100
semi-private institutions

280
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,620
that play a crucial hand in UAP legacy programs.

281
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,540
I recommend any of my previous four investigations

282
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,260
to hear more on the subject.

283
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,620
It is intriguing, Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo,

284
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,940
all but admitted the Aerospace Corporation

285
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,460
built from TRW is actively involved

286
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,860
in UAP legacy programs.

287
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,060
And that up to that point,

288
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,780
TRW had been a primary contractor in such UFO programs.

289
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,700
So all this talk about private contractors,

290
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
you know, the big Lockheed Martin,

291
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,420
what about federally funded research and development centers,

292
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,220
such as MITRE, RAND, TRIAD, Oak Ridge, and UARC,

293
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,820
so university affiliated research centers,

294
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,100
where do they fall into this?

295
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,620
Only one, and I won't name it.

296
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,100
It started out as a contractor in 1960,

297
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,380
starting not too long after it was born.

298
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,860
It was actually a spinoff of TRW.

299
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,140
So TRW was the principal investigator for the first

300
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,420
roughly what, almost 30, yeah, practically, well, 29 years.

301
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,740
Before we keep discussing TRW,

302
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,420
let's highlight a former U.S. Premier Electronics Manufacturer

303
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,980
implicated in TUO exploitation

304
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,460
by Lieutenant Colonel Corsa with possible ties to MITRE

305
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,500
and the Aerospace Corporation,

306
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,260
this being the company I just mentioned above,

307
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,420
the Sparey RAND Corporation.

308
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,500
In his manuscript, Corsa would reference

309
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,700
the personal memoirs of Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau,

310
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,460
Chief of U.S. Army R&D

311
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,660
and Founder of the Army's Foreign Technology Division,

312
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,060
and how Trudeau would engage in frequent meetings

313
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,500
with Sparey RAND's board,

314
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,620
including legendary General Douglas MacArthur.

315
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,260
Sparey RAND went defunct in 1986

316
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,140
and its former divisions became part of Lockheed Martin,

317
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,780
Raytheon, Honeywell, and you guessed it, Northrop Grumman,

318
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,780
all companies implicated in UFO legacy programs.

319
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,980
But let's get back to TRW.

320
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,300
TRW features some familiar faces of this channel

321
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,380
many will recognize.

322
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,100
Remember if you will, Dr. Eric Walker,

323
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,540
the scientist named by physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher

324
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,460
as participating in UFO crash retrieval meetings

325
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,020
alongside Vannefar Bush in the 1950s.

326
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,700
Walker started Penn State's

327
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,780
University Affiliated Research Center,

328
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,420
self-admitted he knew about the Majestic 12

329
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,300
and was present at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.

330
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,380
I have always talked about how Walker

331
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,780
is one of the most crucial names in UFO crash retrieval

332
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,980
and reverse engineering programs in the 1950s and 1960s.

333
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,980
Much intrigues me about Walker,

334
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,060
including his position as former chairman of TRW.

335
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,180
TRW has also been discussed at length

336
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,980
by respected researchers such as Richard Dolan

337
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,260
as the primary contractor running a crash retrieval program

338
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,580
under the project named Zodiac.

339
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,260
Project Zodiac, an MJ-12-like entity,

340
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,820
is not our subject today.

341
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,660
However, we may discuss it soon

342
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,740
as the story of Zodiac by pseudonym Sedge Masters

343
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,940
is utterly captivating.

344
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,220
And with TRW, we may just have a paper trail

345
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,020
to connect them and Northrop to legacy operations.

346
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,820
In 2004, former assistant secretary

347
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,500
of housing and urban development,

348
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,380
Catherine Austin Fitz, wrote a paper called

349
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,220
The Black Budget of the United States.

350
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,620
This paper stated a large portion of the nation's wealth

351
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,020
had ongoing leave and illegally diverted

352
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,140
into secret, unaccountable channels

353
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,100
to support clandestine military research and development.

354
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,300
Some to a majority of which had been suggested

355
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,340
to be UAP-related.

356
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,780
While at the HUD department,

357
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,420
Fitz came across information

358
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,940
various high-profile defense contractors accounting systems

359
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,540
were responsible for scrubbing and obfuscating

360
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,740
the direction of these funds.

361
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,660
Although a 1990 federal law mandated

362
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,620
every single U.S. government agency be audited,

363
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,900
the Pentagon never publicly faced a comprehensive audit

364
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,680
until one was launched in December of 2017.

365
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,280
And not to mention since,

366
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,000
the Pentagon has never passed an audit.

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,480
And this 2017 audit may have happened solely due

368
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,560
to another Catherine Austin Fitz University paper

369
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,560
detailing $21 trillion in unauthorized spending

370
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,080
in the DOD and Department of Housing

371
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,920
and Urban Development from 1998 to 2015.

372
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,440
In the Wilson Davis memo,

373
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,660
which I have talked about so many times,

374
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,800
Admiral Thomas Wilson relates to Dr. Eric Davis,

375
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,920
the watch committee,

376
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,520
the gatekeepers of the UAP legacy program portfolio,

377
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,160
told Wilson they are organized after an audit

378
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,360
in the 1990s almost blew their cover.

379
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,120
What this means is essentially a failed audit

380
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,800
led to UAP programs being reorganized

381
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,760
under the special access program oversight committee,

382
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,600
senior review group.

383
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,240
Here is where we circle back.

384
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,440
In 2003, Northrop Grumman settled a lawsuit

385
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,400
from the U.S. government for $111 million,

386
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,400
almost $200 million today.

387
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,440
This settlement was due to Northrop subsidiary TRW,

388
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,200
overcharging for government work done on space projects

389
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,840
in the early 1990s.

390
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,120
This suggests TRW's inflated space project contracts

391
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,920
were implicated and uncovered in the failed audit

392
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,880
mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo

393
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,640
that took place in the 1990s.

394
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,560
Timelines indeed match up as the beginning roots

395
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,480
of this lawsuit can be traced back to 1994.

396
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,840
TRW's likely involvement with UAP legacy

397
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,640
waived unacknowledged special access programs

398
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,760
appeared as contract overcharging

399
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,680
to the wider DOD auditing officials,

400
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,160
leading to the lawsuit against TRW

401
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,200
settled by Northrop, utterly fascinating.

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,280
If this hypothesis is accurate,

403
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,040
Northrop settled the suit and reorganized their UAP portfolio

404
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,640
under the SAPOX Senior Review Group program reorganization

405
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
that was relayed to Wilson.

406
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,000
To make Northrop's purchase of TRW even more interesting,

407
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,360
shortly before Northrop bought TRW in 2002,

408
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,360
TRW had purchased BDM, Braddock Dunn and McDonald in 1997.

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
BDM was a technical services firm

410
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,320
that headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas,

411
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,360
White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico,

412
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,840
and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.

413
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,520
BDM specialized in and worked primarily

414
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,040
with missile guidance, application optics,

415
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,640
electronic instrumentation, and radiation physics.

416
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,760
BDM was also founded in 1959,

417
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,560
around the same time as MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation.

418
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,240
BDM was mentioned specifically by Commander Will Miller

419
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,360
of the Wilson Davis Memo in the year 2000.

420
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
The former U.S. Navy commander

421
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
stated numerous government individuals

422
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,040
such as Defense Intelligence Agency directors

423
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,920
who in this case would have been Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson

424
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
were isolated from UAP knowledge.

425
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
The quote-unquote keepers of the secrets

426
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,120
resided in DOD middle management and civilian contractors

427
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,360
like Boeing, Lockheed, and BDM.

428
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,720
To learn more about Miller

429
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,360
and why his words carry weight,

430
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,320
I highly recommend watching my video

431
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,680
on the Wilson Davis Memo.

432
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,480
Sure, it's my first video and it's very amateurish,

433
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,760
but there's still some good information there.

434
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
BDM could warrant its own video,

435
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
but for now, I leave you with this.

436
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,720
Just like FFRDCs, I have talked ad nauseam

437
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,920
of Major General Albert Stubblebine

438
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,840
and how his department, U.S. Army INSCOM

439
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,640
and their previous Special Forces Unit,

440
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,560
the Intelligence Support Activity,

441
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,320
have been historically involved with UAP crash retrieval.

442
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,800
In 1984, Stubblebine was replaced as head of INSCOM

443
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,520
and went on to serve as vice president for BDM.

444
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,960
The following year in 1985,

445
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,320
BDM would host an advanced theoretical physics conference

446
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,360
to discuss UFO reverse engineering opportunities.

447
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,280
And actually, let's not stop there with BDM.

448
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,600
In 1989, NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler

449
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,880
was introduced to retired rear admiral Sumner Shapiro

450
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,600
from Bobby Ray Inman.

451
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,440
Inman was then board member of SAIC and Wackenhut

452
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,180
and former NSA director and CIA deputy director.

453
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,480
I have reason to believe Inman engaged with UAP programs

454
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,040
in each of these four positions,

455
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,080
but that is not our topic for today.

456
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,840
Shapiro told Eschler factions within the U.S.

457
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
possess extraterrestrial vehicles

458
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,960
and that he had even studied one at close quarters.

459
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
According to Shapiro, teams would take apart craft,

460
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,600
pack them up and ship them across the country

461
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
to different locations.

462
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,280
These craft featured unique interlocking components

463
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
that had to be dissembled in an exact sequence

464
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,640
to be put back together.

465
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,000
Rear admiral Shapiro was not only

466
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,080
former director of naval intelligence,

467
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,080
but also BDM international board member at the time, 1989.

468
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,740
To this day, Northrop Grumman maintains

469
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,200
a major corporate presence in Tyson Corner

470
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,720
near the former BDM headquarters.

471
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,880
All of this commentary on TRW, Teledyne Ryan,

472
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,840
which we will get to shortly in BDM,

473
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,680
served to highlight how Northrop Grumman

474
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,160
and its many acquisitions interweave intimately

475
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,100
with numerous cases we have covered on this channel.

476
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,840
If the claims of Philip J. Corso are indeed true,

477
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,480
Northrop's modern day legacy program operations

478
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,320
can likely trace its roots back to the US Army's

479
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,800
golden age of research and development in 1958 to 1962.

480
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,240
This would also mean many of Northrop Corporation

481
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,900
and Northrop Grumman's acquisitions

482
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,040
were to purchase companies that had active,

483
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,080
ongoing UFO legacy programs.

484
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,760
This sort of context is crucial to establish

485
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,880
before we explore whistleblower claims

486
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,920
of Northrop's operations in these programs.

487
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,800
And last thing before we continue,

488
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,940
many individuals think of Lockheed Skunkworks Division

489
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,160
when they picture UFO reverse engineering

490
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,400
and material exploitation programs in the private sector.

491
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Well, in 1992, Northrop created its own

492
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,120
quote unquote answer to Skunkworks.

493
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,080
Northrop created the NATDC,

494
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,840
Northrop Advanced Technology and Design Center

495
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,080
to focus on the company's core key defense programs.

496
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,680
While we have already discussed many of NG's acquisitions

497
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
and their ties to UFO legacy programs

498
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,600
from the 1960s to 1990s,

499
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
let's back up and trace mentions

500
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,080
and claims surrounding specifically

501
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,280
the Northrop Corporation and later Northrop Grumman.

502
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,040
I often think back to the words of US Army Colonel

503
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,520
and advisor to US Army Futures Command, Carl Nell,

504
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
who once stated,

505
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,000
Non-human intelligence exists.

506
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,080
Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity.

507
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,200
This interaction is not new and it's been ongoing.

508
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,040
And there are unelected people in the government

509
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,760
that are aware of that.

510
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
And so, Carl, that is quite a bold statement.

511
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm wondering and I'm curious,

512
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,600
how confident are you that that is true?

513
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,000
There's zero doubt.

514
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Nell has served as an outspoken advocate for David Grush

515
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and the existence of technologies of unknown origin.

516
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
One has to wonder if this absence of doubt

517
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
arose from Nell's position as Deputy CTO

518
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and Director of Systems Engineering and Integration

519
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
for 13 years on Northrop Grumman.

520
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
After all, while serving as Northrop's Deputy CTO,

521
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Nell was additionally serving as Command Representative

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Service,

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Material Program.

524
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Northrop's earliest contributions to legacy programs

525
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
may trace back to 1968.

526
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
MS Can and GM Andrew of Northrop Northair

527
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
published a paper on the electro aerodynamics

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
in supersonic flow, suggesting Northrop was researching

529
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
methods to reduce drag of an aircraft

530
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
by creating an electrostatic field around the craft.

531
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This may remind some of T. Townsend-Brown and electro-gravidics.

532
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
In Nick Cook's excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point,

533
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
one Dan Marcus is mentioned, a pseudonym for a source

534
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in the British aerospace industry.

535
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Marcus relayed to Cook that in 2002,

536
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
the Pentagon pulled the specific paper and, quote,

537
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
made it disappear, end quote.

538
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Marcus would suggest the B-2 Spirit Bomber

539
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
applied these concepts to employ an electrostatic field

540
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
around the aircraft to reduce drag.

541
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
In fact, some UFO researchers such as Michael Schrap

542
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and Dr. Richard Boylan take this a step further,

543
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
suggesting the B-2 employs reverse engineered

544
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
possibly electro-gravidic technology,

545
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
leading to the massive cost of the systems.

546
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The question is, and Mark talked about this before,

547
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye?

548
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Aviation Week Space Technology, March 9, 1992,

549
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
had a very interesting article from people

550
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
who worked at Northrop who were very upset

551
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that the technology associated with the B-2 program

552
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
was not being trickled down to the public industry.

553
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges

554
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature.

555
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's what you see in this diagram right here.

556
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And then negatively charges the exhaust gases

557
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to reduce the infrared signature.

558
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is the same type of electro-gravidic technology

559
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s.

560
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So this technology might date back a lot earlier

561
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
than we originally thought.

562
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The first true mention of Northrop engaging with NHI technology

563
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
comes from the work of UFO researcher William Hamilton.

564
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Hamilton's book, Cosmic Top Secret,

565
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is in my opinion the most underappreciated book

566
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
in all of ufology.

567
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It is a truly excellent piece, decades ahead of its time.

568
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
For example, the 1992 book makes the first recorded mention

569
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
of the term ARV and discussion of the Fluxliner,

570
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
which wouldn't rise to fame until Stephen Greer's

571
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
2001 disclosure project event.

572
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Mind you, Hamilton did misquote the ARV acronym

573
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
stating Alien Replicated Vehicle instead of Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

574
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
However, my research has shown Hamilton spoke to Bill Scott

575
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
of Aviation Week in Space Technology

576
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
to discuss the Brad Sorenson Fluxliner testimony

577
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
in the early 90s.

578
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The next time someone tries to say Stephen Greer

579
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
coined the term ARV, send them this passage.

580
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And Hamilton actually told Greer about the 1988

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Norton Air Force Base Show Fluxliner incident

582
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and actually passed along both primary witness Sorenson

583
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and aerospace illustrator McCandlish to Greer.

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Hamilton was one of the first to draw serious research

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
to the Antelope Valley, California, near Edwards Air Force Base.

586
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Hamilton drew attention to Lockheed's Gunkworks, Rockwell,

587
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
McDonnell Douglas, and Northrop, all having plants

588
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
in Palmdale, California.

589
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The nation's then chief center of aerospace technology

590
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
in the middle of these complexes sat Air Force Plant 42,

591
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
a name many associate with UAP programs.

592
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The author of Cosmic Top Secret does not draw attention

593
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
to the Northrop facility near Palmdale,

594
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but instead to a secret underground installation

595
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
north in the Tujachepe Mountains.

596
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Hamilton accuses the Northrop-Tahan Ranch Radar Cross-Section Facility

597
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and accompanying underground installation as a UAP program facility.

598
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Very little is known about this facility and the underground extension,

599
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
but let's see what we can dig up.

600
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
This site officially serves as a radar cross-section range.

601
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Quickly, what exactly is a radar cross-section facility?

602
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves

603
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
to test aircraft radar signatures.

604
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The sites utilize large runways and pylons

605
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
raised from underground on concrete diamonds

606
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.

607
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Many RCS facilities saw construction during the Cold War.

608
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This led the majority of installations being built underground

609
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies

610
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
away from Soviet spy satellites.

611
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
In Cosmic Top Secret, William Hamilton discussed numerous statements

612
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
recounted to him, such as a 1988 sighting of a giant boomerang

613
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
over the Northrop facility and a flying saucer

614
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
seen taking off from a building on the property.

615
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The Northrop RCS facility has recorded several anomalous sightings throughout history,

616
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
oftentimes glowing orbs seen around the facility.

617
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
According to some researchers,

618
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
the facility sees a disproportionate amount of sightings

619
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
compared to the Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities nearby.

620
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And this isn't the first time I've discussed this Northrop location.

621
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Remember back to my work on the Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle,

622
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

623
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's reference forensic artist Bill McDonald's 1992 piece,

624
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the Tuhachibi Triangle,

625
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
in which the artist drew a reverse-engineered triangular craft

626
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
detailed to him by disgruntled engineers from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

627
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The engineers hailed from the Northrop RCS facility at Tehan

628
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and Lockheed Martin-Hellendale RCS plant.

629
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
According to their testimonies,

630
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
the facilities doubled as UFO reverse engineering

631
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and material exploitation locations.

632
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If you have not seen this investigation,

633
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I highly recommend watching as the XF-131 Super Sentinel

634
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
is absolutely fascinating research.

635
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And RCS locations have actually seen much discussion in ufology.

636
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
With the contentious Steven Greer in particular,

637
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
labeling the Hellendale plant as a staging ground for electro-gravitic ARV,

638
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and a forward operating base employing EMP weapons for ARV testing

639
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and downing of non-human vehicles.

640
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and other senior officials had no idea of this.

642
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system

643
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
didn't know about it.

644
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I had known about it since the 90s,

645
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
but I'd never of course flown directly over it

646
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.

647
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

648
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building

649
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
since the 1954-55 come out.

650
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They go up and they hover, they're silent,

651
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
they're electro-gravitic, anti-grab.

652
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The diamond on the left, you see that it looks like a runway with a diamond?

653
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get,

654
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
there's not an aerodynamic, they just go boom up.

655
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But they're placed over different diamonds.

656
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these

657
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
who don't have time to go through.

658
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And that's where they're put at various elevations

659
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon

660
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.

661
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Now this may seem extreme,

662
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
but there is quite a bit of valid research

663
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to discuss weapons that have been designed to down UAP.

664
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But what more can we factually learn about the underground portion

665
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
of the Tehan RCS facility?

666
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The Northrop site would then be discussed

667
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
in Dr. Richard Sodder's excellent book,

668
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Underground Bases and Tunnels,

669
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
which takes an evidence-based approach

670
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
to studying subterranean facilities,

671
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
aka deep underground military bases, DUMMS.

672
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
This is my absolute favorite book on the subject of DUMMS

673
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
as Sodder tackles the subject often associated with conspiracies

674
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
with rigorous fact-based research.

675
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Sodder states Northrop alongside numerous Fortune 500 companies

676
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
such as Lockheed Martin employ high-tech underground centers

677
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
in California and claims with a high degree of certainty

678
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
these facilities are, quote,

679
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
equally engaged in non-conventional high-tech aerospace research,

680
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
end quote.

681
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Dr. Sodder is equally confident the underground portion

682
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
of the Northrop RCS facility engages

683
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
in the same non-conventional research,

684
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
but is unsure just how far beneath the Earth

685
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Northrop's activities extend.

686
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Rumors persist under the site there exist as many

687
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
as 42 underground levels and connective tunnels

688
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
to nearby facilities as well as Edwards Air Force Base.

689
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The validity and very real existence of these locations

690
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and tunnels will be another topic for another day

691
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
as there is quite a volume of valuable research

692
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
to speak to the legitimacy of interconnected

693
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
deep underground military bases.

694
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Because yes, I do plan on using Dr. Sodder's research

695
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
for a full deep dive into DUMMS.

696
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But I would just like to say that TRW,

697
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Northrop's golden child, also has a storied history

698
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in connected subterranean facilities.

699
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

700
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and U.S. National Committee on Tunneling Technology,

701
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
USNC slash TT, conducted myriad studies, reports,

702
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and patents on underground ICBM-based design,

703
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
tunneling technologies, tunnel boring machines,

704
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
tunnel depths, et cetera.

705
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
TRW engaged and published a number of studies

706
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
determining the viability of high-speed

707
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
ground transportation tunnel design.

708
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
For example, we can analyze this 1968 report

709
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
where TRW discusses high-speed underground

710
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
transportation vehicles in tunnel diameters

711
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
ranging from 80 to 40 feet.

712
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
At a depth of 400 to 2,500 feet.

713
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Another topic for another day, as I stated.

714
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Analyzing McDonald, Sodder, and Hamilton,

715
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the question must be asked,

716
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
does Northrop Grumman test and operate

717
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
reverse engineered NHI vehicles?

718
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Out of an underground facility beneath the Tehan RCS site,

719
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS locations

720
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
do, after all, reside in close proximity to

721
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Edwards Air Force Base, the former Norton Air Force Base,

722
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and Palmdale, USAF Plant 42.

723
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Norton and Plant 42 are integral pieces

724
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to the Fluxliner ARV testimony of Brad Sorensen

725
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and Mark McCandlish.

726
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And carefully connecting research

727
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and analyzing the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Ed,

728
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I have accused Edwards Air Force Base

729
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and their 412th test group,

730
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
as running a UFO reverse engineering testing program

731
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
between Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

732
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Several testimonies over the decades,

733
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
outside of Echler, Miller, and McDonald's

734
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
four anonymous engineers have labeled

735
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Northrop Grumman directly,

736
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
as participating in UFO crash retrieval,

737
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
reverse engineering, and material exploitation.

738
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Many will recall the testimony of Edgar Fouchet

739
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and the TR-3B reverse engineer triangular craft.

740
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Many write off Fouchet due to the absence

741
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
of hard physical proof of his claims.

742
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
However, I do highly recommend viewing my piece

743
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
on triangle ARVs in general,

744
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
as a tremendous amount of research

745
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
resulted from Fouchet's disclosures.

746
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The 250 foot prototype and 600 foot operational

747
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
TR-3B models according to Fouchet

748
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
saw test flights over Edwards Air Force Base,

749
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
conducted by the AFFTC Air Force Test Center,

750
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
which oddly enough operates under the 412th test group

751
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
which we discussed above.

752
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Strange as near Edwards, where these test flights

753
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
allegedly occur, Northrop has nearby installations,

754
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
both near Palmdale, USAF Plant 42,

755
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
as well as a mysterious underground location

756
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
where anomalous craft have been reported

757
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
over the decades.

758
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Fouchet also outright named the contractors

759
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
responsible for the construction of TR-3B.

760
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
FFRDC's Sandia and Livermore Labs

761
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
reverse engineer the propulsion device.

762
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But the primary contractors of the project

763
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
were listed as Lockheed, Boeing,

764
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Teledyne Ryan, and Northrop.

765
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I would now like to shift to a fascinating few details

766
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
from the whistleblower testimony of Colonel Steve Wilson.

767
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Wilson's testimony was made public around 1997,

768
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
shortly before his death,

769
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
through researcher Dr. Richard Boylan.

770
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Boylan has historically published some claims

771
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I approach with skepticism,

772
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
so I tried multiple times to connect with him

773
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
regarding Wilson, but have heard nothing.

774
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Colonel Steve Wilson does deserve his own video

775
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
as this enigmatic figure is well worth investigating.

776
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And disclaimer, we cannot 100% prove Wilson's

777
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
40-year military background,

778
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
as numerous articles exist on the web detailing

779
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
his DD-214 in education, training, and medals.

780
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
However, we do not have any scans or copies

781
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
of Wilson's official records or images of him in service.

782
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
For this reason, I do also recommend reading

783
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Kevin Randall's skeptical take on Wilson

784
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and Boylan's reporting, which raises concerns,

785
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
such as 40 years of service listed on Wilson's DD-214,

786
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
as well as seemingly misreported medals.

787
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
To summarize Wilson's disclosures,

788
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Wilson claimed in 1963 as a captain in the tactical

789
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
fighter squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

790
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
He was assigned to the Majestic 12 and promoted to Major.

791
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Here, the then Major learned of the Majestic 12's

792
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
modus operandi to control, quote,

793
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
UFO surveillance and interdictions, retrievals,

794
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and analysis of records of extraterrestrial

795
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
spacecraft and occupants, and public access

796
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
to any information about these matters, end quote.

797
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
As part of his duties, Wilson would be assigned

798
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
to the First Special Forces Air Command,

799
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and would undergrow special training with Delta Force

800
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and the then Black Berets.

801
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
For nine years, Colonel Wilson claimed to visit

802
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
nearly every Air Force Base in the world

803
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and make contact with key people for the Majestic 12 unit.

804
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Wilson states, whilst a Lieutenant Colonel in 1972,

805
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
he was reassigned from First Special Forces Air Command

806
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California

807
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to Area S-4, near Papouse Lake, south of Area 51,

808
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
by men with CIA credentials.

809
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I am skipping a tremendous amount of detail here,

810
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
as this is not our subject for today,

811
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
but Wilson would travel 30 stories underground

812
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
in the facility where he witnessed eight different

813
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
kinds of non-human craft, as well as an extremely

814
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
tall woman that appeared to be extraterrestrial.

815
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
According to Wilson, S-4 operated to test

816
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
anti-gravity reverse engineered vehicles.

817
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The first successful flight had allegedly occurred

818
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
on July 18, 1971, a year before his station,

819
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test.

820
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Interesting connection to Echler, Inman, and Shapiro,

821
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
as we stated above.

822
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
After some time at S-4, Wilson would claim to head

823
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Project Pounce, an elite Air Force NRO Special Forces unit

824
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
which retrieved downed UFOs.

825
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oddly enough, Project Pounce can be observed

826
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
in the disputed Majestic 12 Project Aquarius document

827
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report.

828
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel

829
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to reduce public concern regarding UFOs.

830
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So, Wilson has a big, unprovable testimony.

831
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What does any of this have to do with Northrop Grumman?

832
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
In his disclosures to Dr. Boylan, Wilson additionally named

833
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
US Aerospace Vehicles that had been created

834
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
utilizing reverse engineered non-human technology.

835
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Many of these vehicles would feature anti-gravity systems,

836
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and after all of the research we've done on this channel

837
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and the words of Jake Barber, maybe this isn't so far-fetched.

838
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The implications of what you're saying also are that potentially

839
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
there is some kind of capacity to draw incredible amounts of energy

840
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
from the quantum vacuum.

841
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I've seen it.

842
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You've seen it.

843
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I've seen it.

844
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There's also, obviously, the capacity to use propulsion systems

845
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that are far beyond what we're describing.

846
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah, that seems to be the case as well.

847
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Anti-gravity.

848
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Anti-gravity.

849
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
They know about it.

850
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Anti-gravity, zero point energy.

851
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Those secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge.

852
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Wilson would state US clandestine military operations

853
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
began flying the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle,

854
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
but also discussed an anti-gravity disc

855
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
that glowed intense orange-golden during flight.

856
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Wilson claimed this craft was made by Northrop Aerospace

857
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
at their secret facility northeast of Lancaster, California.

858
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This location is quite interesting,

859
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
as it matches the underground Northrop range

860
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
we discussed earlier in this investigation.

861
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Wilson would even state the Northrop, Lockheed,

862
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities were connected alongside

863
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Area 51 and other sensitive locations via underground train systems.

864
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Wilson claimed these tunnels were excavated by nuclear subterranes,

865
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
which is actually very interesting.

866
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Nuclear subterranes are massive tunneling machines

867
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
that work by melting rock with heat supplied

868
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
via a compact nuclear reactor.

869
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Numerous patents for such machines were designed

870
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
by Los Alamos National Laboratories in the 1970s,

871
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and don't worry, we will fully dive into this in the dumb video.

872
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Boylan had reportedly witnessed this craft in test flight

873
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
over Area 51 in the Northrop complex near Edwards,

874
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
dubbing it Northrop's Great Pumpkin Disk.

875
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
These two siding locations are another fascinating connection to EDD,

876
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and the joint reverse engineering effort between Edwards,

877
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
contractors, and Area 51.

878
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Wilson made additional mentions to a reverse engineered craft

879
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
designated the XH-75D, or the XH Shark.

880
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
This craft is allegedly an anti-gravity helicopter

881
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
designed by Teledyne Ryan San Diego Division.

882
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Wilson claimed these craft were assigned to Delta IV

883
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
slash the NRO for UFO crash retrievals.

884
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This mention of NRO and Delta is indeed intriguing.

885
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Delta Force, part of the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC,

886
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
has been accused of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals

887
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
under the CIA Office of Global Access, as has indeed the NRO.

888
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
In fact, the NRO was one of two intelligence agencies,

889
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
the other being the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency

890
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
we discussed above with C4ISR.

891
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
David Grush worked on as liaison to the UAP Task Force,

892
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
where he discovered the existence of UAP legacy programs.

893
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The NRO was also one of three intelligence agencies

894
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
alongside the CIA and NSA mentioned by Edgar Fuchet

895
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
as managing the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle.

896
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Very little has been discussed on this craft,

897
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
the XH-75D, original drawing by Wilson on screen now.

898
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And almost no actionable investigation can arise

899
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
from Wilson's incredibly brief testimony on this craft.

900
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The Colonel never discussed the intended application

901
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
or function of the onboard anti-gravity system.

902
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What I do find interesting is a 2019 design concept

903
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
created by one of Lockheed Martin's subsidiaries,

904
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the Sikorsky Raider X.

905
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Dual rotor helicopters are not rare.

906
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
They are often implemented on helicopters designed for heavy lift.

907
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
One would have to ask why the XH-75D would need dual rotors

908
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
with an anti-gravity system.

909
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But the Raider X, canceled in 24,

910
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
sought to create a quote,

911
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
agile, survivable compound coaxial helicopter

912
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
that will equip future aviators to address

913
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
evolving peer and near-peer threats

914
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
in the most difficult environments, end quote.

915
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
No further linkages beyond design exist between these platforms.

916
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
However, I do find it interesting the XH-75D,

917
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
drawn by Wilson in 97,

918
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
looks almost identical to the concept craft

919
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
proposed by Lockheed in 2019.

920
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So is the anti-gravity disk in helicopter

921
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
proposed by Wilson real?

922
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Well, this is unfortunately a dead end of investigation.

923
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
As I said, Wilson's testimony must be considered

924
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
little more than third-party research.

925
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Because while it is fascinating

926
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and ties intimately to some claims made regarding

927
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
UAP Legacy Recovery programs throughout history,

928
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
there is little evidence or actionable data to pursue.

929
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I would, however, like to leave discussion of Wilson

930
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
with a chart he made regarding the structure

931
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
of UAP Legacy programs.

932
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Please note, the rendition I am showing now

933
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
is a recreation of Wilson's 97 chart published in 2001.

934
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Numerous spelling errors can be observed here,

935
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
such as in Lockheed.

936
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This chart is titled Star Wars City

937
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
in reference to the Strategic Defense Initiative,

938
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the program we mentioned above,

939
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and a program I have discussed many times,

940
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
instituted by Reagan in the 1980s

941
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
with possible ties to Eisenhower.

942
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
To state again, the SDI program instituted to protect

943
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
the United States from ballistic nuclear attacks

944
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
has been referenced by numerous witnesses

945
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
who have stated the program had a backdoor functionality

946
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
to act offensively against UAP

947
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and back-channeled funds to fund UFO Legacy programs.

948
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
From the chart, Star Wars City

949
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
located under the Cheyenne Mountain Complex

950
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

951
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
oversees the U.S. Space Counterintelligence Headquarters

952
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
within the SDI as the nexus of UAP Legacy programs.

953
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Within this chart, there are numerous institutions

954
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
one might expect to be associated with UAP retrieval

955
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and exploitation programs, the NRO,

956
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
National Security Council, National Security Agency,

957
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
CIA, NORAD, and Majestic 12.

958
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Adhering to the SDI, Colorado HQ, and Magi,

959
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
there exists a list of contractors

960
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
alleged to engage with the UAP portfolio.

961
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed,

962
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and IBM are mentioned.

963
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We also find Decision Science Applications Inc.

964
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
DSAI was led by former Admiral

965
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and recurring character of this project, Bobby Ray Inman,

966
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and most likely had its assets handed over to SAIC.

967
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
A contractor I believe is as involved in legacy operations

968
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
as Northrop or Lockheed.

969
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Another project for another day,

970
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
as DSAI is quite a worthy investigation.

971
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
DSI, according to the chart and Wilson's testimony,

972
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
consists of directors of relevant UAP black budget divisions

973
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
from the aforementioned contractors,

974
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
as well as Ford Aerospace, which is now part of Northrop Grumman,

975
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and Teledyne Ryan,

976
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
which was one of Northrop's premium purchases.

977
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
When Teledyne Ryan did indeed play a vital role

978
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
in the Strategic Defense Initiative,

979
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
the contractor was well regarded for designing

980
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and producing high-performance aerial targets,

981
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
which were crucial for testing and evaluation potential

982
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
for missile defense systems,

983
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
as well as developing advanced sensors

984
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
that could be used for detecting and tracking

985
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
incoming ballistic missiles.

986
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
TRW, Northrop's crown jewel,

987
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
additionally aided in the SDI program,

988
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
such as using its locations

989
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
for high-powered chemical laser testing.

990
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And as we mentioned above,

991
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Northrop itself takes great pride in aiding in the SDI program

992
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
in 1983, creating the first laser radar used in space.

993
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It is fascinating, even in a testimony like Wilson's,

994
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
we can still find links to Northrop's many acquisitions

995
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and UAP legacy programs.

996
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And now onto a whistleblower by the acronym of A-H

997
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.

998
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And I must state again, regarding Greer's witnesses,

999
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
let us analyze the quality and claims of the whistleblower

1000
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
instead of the platform.

1001
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Unfortunately, Greer's poor operational security

1002
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
is ever-present, as clips of A-H are listed

1003
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
in the DPI archive as Arnold House.

1004
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I believe I have located this individual

1005
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and have reached out to talk to him.

1006
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I have heard nothing.

1007
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Arnold's testimony revolves around the significant information

1008
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
he gained regarding UAP programs

1009
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
while a surface technician at the Boeing Aerospace Company,

1010
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
as well as insights gained from friend and four-star general,

1011
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Curtis LeMay.

1012
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
As we dive in, it is crucial to maintain awareness

1013
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
how his disclosures are indeed secondhand.

1014
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
As far as his testimony,

1015
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
House never participated directly in program operations.

1016
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
His information was handed to him from friends at NSA,

1017
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
CIA, NASA, JPL,

1018
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Office of Naval Intelligence Area 51,

1019
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
USAF, Northrop, Boeing, and various generals.

1020
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
This information was so complete, according to Greer,

1021
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
House briefed Bill Clinton in 1990.

1022
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I have no evidence to confirm this briefing.

1023
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
The only possible link I can find is a letter to Clinton from Greer

1024
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
marked 9 July 2000,

1025
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
where Greer requested the city president to disclose

1026
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
UFO-related USAPs at the suggestion of their mutual friend.

1027
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I do find House very worthy of discussion

1028
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
as we can find correspondences with him and Greer

1029
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
as recently as 2018 and as old as December 2000.

1030
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Perhaps House, like William Hamilton,

1031
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
has served as one of Greer's primary sources of information

1032
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
over the decades.

1033
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In his taped testimony linked in description,

1034
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
House stated one day around 1987

1035
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
at the home of General Curtis LeMay,

1036
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
the infamous general confirmed the Roswell, New Mexico crash.

1037
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
House also learned from his NSA friend that Henry Kissinger,

1038
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
George Bush, as well as Ronald Reagan

1039
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the UAP subject.

1040
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
His friends in CIA relayed to House

1041
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
that they, along with USAF, had downed NHI craft.

1042
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Arnold even claimed he learned from a friend in the FBI

1043
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
that the Bureau had radar testing that was causing interference

1044
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
with some of the craft resulting in crashes.

1045
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This echoes Lieutenant Colonel Corso's sentiments

1046
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
regarding the crash of the Roswell, New Mexico craft.

1047
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
House also learned and relayed there are underground bases

1048
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
testing and maintaining TUOs,

1049
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
likely Dugway, Palmdale, California,

1050
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Edwards Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and others.

1051
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Interesting we see Palmdale and Edwards pop up once again.

1052
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But now let's focus directly on Arnold's information

1053
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
regarding Northrop.

1054
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
House's entire testimony could lead to an entire video

1055
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
so maybe we will save that for whistleblowers volume 3.

1056
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
A.H. stated while at Boeing he met a man

1057
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
in the Army Criminal Investigation Division, CID,

1058
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
who was involved in several crash recovery since 1947

1059
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and had served in Army CIC, Counter Intelligence Corps, Capacity.

1060
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The gentleman handpicked one of House's friends

1061
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
at the Boeing aircraft company to become part of a UFO

1062
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
crash recovery team in northern New Mexico starting in 1980.

1063
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
This friend of A.H. would somehow relay information

1064
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
regarding his time in legacy program operations

1065
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
from 1980 to 1997, 17 years.

1066
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
The time of these disclosures is not given, however,

1067
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
as investigators we must assume that his friend

1068
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
informed Arnold after leaving program operations in 1997.

1069
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
House's friend was ultimately stationed and helped

1070
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
with reverse engineering efforts and testing

1071
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
of non-human craft at Area 51.

1072
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
He was not working for the U.S. government or military, however.

1073
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
His paychecks during these years in legacy programs

1074
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
came directly from Northrop.

1075
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
The source would illustrate Northrop, Lockheed Martin,

1076
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and Boeing all engaged in UFO reverse engineering efforts

1077
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
at Area 51.

1078
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
The facility itself from 1980 to 1997

1079
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
held a tremendous amount of extraterrestrial debris

1080
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
in a containment area.

1081
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This source would also tell House some of the program

1082
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
was shifted to a location in Utah,

1083
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
likely dugway-proving grounds.

1084
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
They moved most of the stuff from Area 51,

1085
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.

1086
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Just basically those companies and of course,

1087
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Lockheed and Northrop.

1088
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
This is very interesting as USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

1089
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
said the exact same thing.

1090
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Some Area 51 legacy programs were relocated to dugway

1091
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
in the early 1990s.

1092
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I myself have talked about dugway previously

1093
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and plan to revisit with a contractor witness

1094
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
who claimed to stumble upon a floating saucer craft

1095
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
within a classified testing area on base.

1096
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Here is where House's testimony regarding Area 51

1097
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and Northrop gets really interesting.

1098
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
This same friend told Arnold the A51 program

1099
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
to test NHI vehicles and exploit technological materials

1100
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
was called Project Red Light.

1101
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area

1102
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and near, this is very funny, it's near Northrop.

1103
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
There's an underground area out there too

1104
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that he was aware of, but he particularly mentioned

1105
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and stayed focused on ANZA, California.

1106
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There's some underground areas up there too

1107
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
that they're researching some of this technology

1108
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.

1109
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
This should immediately become familiar to many of my viewers

1110
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
as I have referenced this Project Red Light

1111
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
on numerous occasions.

1112
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I have traced first mention of this project

1113
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
to the files of the late legendary researcher

1114
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Leonard Stringfield, author of Crash Retrieval Status Reports

1115
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
1-7 and relayed by excellent researcher Michael Schrat.

1116
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
In a letter dated April 5th, 1980,

1117
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one MH,

1118
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
a witness identity Schrat chose not to disclose.

1119
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
MH allegedly performed radio maintenance

1120
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
at the atomic proving grounds in Nevada during 1961 to 1963,

1121
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
along with top secret radio work for USAF.

1122
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
According to MH, he participated in a top secret operation

1123
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
at Area 51 titled Project Red Light.

1124
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Test flights were conducted under this project

1125
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
on a recovered UFO shipped from none other than Edwards Air Force Base.

1126
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
The craft was not conventionally powered

1127
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and stayed silent during operation.

1128
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Security was so tight on the project,

1129
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
program personnel were rotated every six months.

1130
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
MH claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast

1131
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
American defense contractor encountering difficulties

1132
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
in reverse engineering many of the components comprising the craft.

1133
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I have drawn a parallel between Red Light and the testimony of Ed.

1134
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We have referenced numerous times throughout this project,

1135
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
a joint Edwards Area 51 reverse engineering program

1136
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
out of the Edwards 412th Test Group.

1137
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Well, Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

1138
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
additionally mentioned Project Red Light.

1139
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Fouchet claimed he gathered knowledge

1140
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
defense contractor EGNG was awarded an indefinite contract

1141
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
for Project Red Light to support the DOE and military.

1142
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
If you have not heard of EGNG,

1143
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
this is the contractor historically implicated with UAP programs

1144
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
made infamous in the story of Bob Lazar

1145
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
as the contractor that hired him to work out of Site 4.

1146
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
This contract gave EGNG responsibility

1147
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps

1148
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and to provide aerial and ground security

1149
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
for highly classified government and military sites.

1150
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
If the testimony of Arnold House

1151
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and his legacy program connections are indeed true,

1152
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Northrop Grumman could have indeed served

1153
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
as a project manager for Project Red Light,

1154
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
testing non-human intelligence and alien reproduction vehicles

1155
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
in a joint contractor Edwards 412th Test Group operation.

1156
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Absolutely incredible links to ponder.

1157
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We have no project stork,

1158
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
we have no direct mention of Lockheed and so forth

1159
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
but almost in a way I find that a little more intriguing

1160
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
for my research.

1161
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
With Northrop we devoted so much time

1162
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
to look specifically at Northrop Grumman's acquisitions

1163
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM,

1164
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
connections to Aerospace Corporation and FFRDCs

1165
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and I find this so fascinating how

1166
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Northrop's involvement outside of mentions of Fuchshe

1167
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and a couple other mentions here and there

1168
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and comments from Jack Northrop at the beginning of the video

1169
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
they seem to purchase up buy-up companies

1170
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
that had legacy operations.

1171
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
TRW and its implication in the Wilson Davis Memo

1172
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and the Phil Pentagon audit that almost outed the senior review group.

1173
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
$200 million today Northrop paid

1174
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to settle that lawsuit for TRW.

1175
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Now they acquired them I believe for $6 or $7 billion

1176
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
that's a drop in the bucket

1177
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
but it's interesting that a year after the acquisition

1178
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Northrop's still okay with you know what TRW

1179
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you're implicated in this massive lawsuit

1180
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
but don't worry we'll pay for it.

1181
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So I find that sort of research absolutely

1182
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
scintillating instead of just direct confirmations

1183
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
and direct ties like we had with Lockheed and Battelle.

1184
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I also find all of the whistleblower testimony

1185
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
of Northrop to be incredibly fast

1186
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and you know I wouldn't be

1187
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
surprised to see full projects on Steve Wilson

1188
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and Arnold Howe soon.

1189
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Like I mentioned I've tried to connect with House

1190
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
because I do believe with a high degree of certainty

1191
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I have found that individual

1192
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and Colonel or yeah,

1193
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Colonel Steve Wilson is no longer with us

1194
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
he passed in 1997

1195
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
but his testimony is still shrouded in mystery

1196
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and his legitimacy in USAF

1197
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
is still surrounded in mystery

1198
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
so a lot more to explore there

1199
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
but I find it really interesting

1200
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
from the work of William Hamilton

1201
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
the testimony of AH

1202
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
that there's still these little comments

1203
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
that are ubiquitous around testimony

1204
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that I still find to be quite accurate

1205
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
mentions of the SDI

1206
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and UAP Legacy programs mentioned

1207
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Northrop's involvement in underground facilities

1208
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
mention of underground facilities

1209
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
mentioning you know dating to Fouché as well

1210
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
projects being moved from Area 51

1211
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
to Dugway Proving Grounds

1212
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
even mentions of Area 51 in Edwards

1213
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
as we see in Arnold Howe's

1214
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Red Light, Fouché, etc.

1215
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So the question must be asked

1216
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
why is Northrop's involvement

1217
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
in Legacy programs operations

1218
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
so shrouded

1219
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
why do they pass under the radar

1220
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
alongside companies like Boeing and Raytheon

1221
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
while Lockheed Martin, while Battelle

1222
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
these guys, I mean even General Electric

1223
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
to a certain degree are always labeled

1224
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
as the prime contractors

1225
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
well I do have someone of a thesis there

1226
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I think Battelle

1227
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
bar biological storage

1228
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
at probably Fort Detrick or Fort Belbois

1229
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
is a little bit out of the game

1230
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
they're a little bit said and done

1231
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I think the three, four primary players

1232
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
if we want to say

1233
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
are Lockheed Boeing

1234
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
who is likely a project manager

1235
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
for operations

1236
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Northrop and Raytheon

1237
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I think these are the big guys

1238
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I think that

1239
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Lockheed is sort of like

1240
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
a hound dog

1241
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Lockheed will respond to a beck and call

1242
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
they will do what is required of them

1243
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
they are the loudest in the room

1244
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
etc. I think Lockheed

1245
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
is

1246
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
they will take advantage of a situation

1247
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and they are opportunists

1248
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
the reason I say this is the

1249
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
2008 material transfer to OSAP

1250
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
that was blocked by Glenn Gaffney

1251
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
in the CIA

1252
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
directorate of science and technology

1253
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Lockheed itself

1254
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
offered to divest itself of materials

1255
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
now was this

1256
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
to get in the good graces

1257
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
of the CIA

1258
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
the OGA, the DS&T

1259
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
the NRO probably

1260
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
did Lockheed give up

1261
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
materials they could reverse engineer

1262
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Lockheed give away materials they think

1263
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
that any other

1264
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
corporation or agency

1265
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
could reverse engineer

1266
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and garner insights from probably not

1267
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
this was probably materials they thought

1268
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
well if we can't figure it out no one else can

1269
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
so we might as well

1270
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
get in good favor with some people

1271
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
and get rid of these materials

1272
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
which is likely from the 1953 Kigman, Arizona crash

1273
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
but that's a whole other conversation

1274
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Northrop

1275
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
their work seems to be shrouded

1276
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
in much more secrecy

1277
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
they are not offering to divest themselves

1278
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
of material they are often seen in the shadows

1279
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
they are often tag-lined

1280
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
in testimonies like Fouche's

1281
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
as the

1282
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
person in the shadows

1283
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
so that makes the question

1284
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
what work are they doing

1285
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
well I believe it's material exploitation

1286
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
reverse engineering and testing of ARV

1287
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and likely project

1288
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
managerial responsibilities

1289
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
for the red light project if that is still ongoing

1290
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
or if that has shifted since Ed's time

1291
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
around

1292
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Nellis and Edwards

1293
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
ending in about 2006 to 2008

1294
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
so if that project is still ongoing

1295
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I think that Lockheed operates

1296
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
similar to

1297
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and I forgot one on the Mount Rushmore of Legacy

1298
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
operations SAIC

1299
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I think Northrop

1300
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
alongside Lockheed alongside SAIC

1301
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Boeing and perhaps Raytheon

1302
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
they operate across all segments

1303
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
of US military have commented numerous times

1304
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
that

1305
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the Army, the Air Force

1306
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
and the Navy

1307
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
their programs are extremely compartmentalized

1308
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
stove piped as Eric Davis said

1309
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and don't really have much interaction with each other

1310
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
the common threads here are the contractors

1311
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
that interact

1312
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
in programs across compartments

1313
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and possibly the UARCs

1314
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
and FFRDCs that do as well

1315
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
there might be some

1316
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
small contractors that help out

1317
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
with Air Force responsibilities

1318
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
and one such company might be

1319
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Alien Science and Technologies

1320
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
helping Ed

1321
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and the project red light

1322
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
if you want to call it that out at Edwards

1323
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
but the project managers

1324
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
the companies that seem to do quite a bit

1325
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
then engage in all facets

1326
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
of legacy program operations

1327
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
operate across all of these boards

1328
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
so is Northrop still

1329
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
ongoing in research I would probably say

1330
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
yes and Northrop has

1331
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
is up to their eyeballs just like SAIC

1332
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
like Lockheed and just like Boeing

1333
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
but these are my personal opinions

1334
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I think that even though much of the research

1335
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
we have studied today is still

1336
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
whistleblower testimony and

1337
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
a bit nebulous at some points

1338
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
like Steve Wilson

1339
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I still think there are numerous fascinating ties

1340
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I mean

1341
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
again I want to harken back

1342
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
to Northrop's many acquisitions

1343
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and even date that back to Sparey Rand

1344
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
when it went defunct

1345
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
its departments going to Northrop Grumman

1346
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and Lockheed and others

1347
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and connections to the Corso testimony

1348
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
all of these neat little threads

1349
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
that kind of tie Northrop

1350
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and its purchasing streak interwoven

1351
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
into stories of legacy

1352
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
program operations it's very fascinating

1353
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
in a sense this project was

1354
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
almost a little bit more conclusive to me

1355
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
than even Lockheed or Battelle

1356
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I would like to know what everybody else here thinks

1357
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
you know perhaps Northrop silence

1358
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
is a sign of danger

1359
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
we don't know all we can do is continue

1360
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
to investigate and if you have any other

1361
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
insights into Northrop

1362
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
or testimony I would love to hear from

1363
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
you and to tell me what you think in the comments

1364
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
with that guys we will move on

1365
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
because I think I've been ranting out for about

1366
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
8 minutes please remember

1367
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to like and subscribe

1368
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
always look forward to the next project

1369
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
we'll get back in live

1370
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
soon because I would like to talk

1371
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
a little bit about concurring

1372
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
events you know with the whistleblower

1373
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
testimony of Jake Barber

1374
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Dr. John Blitch

1375
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Don Paul Bales

1376
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and so forth and Fred Baker

1377
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
but I don't want to make that my channel

1378
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm not a news of the day type of guy

1379
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
as you all know you know there's a lot

1380
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
of space between the videos so we'll figure

1381
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
out something there so please remember to like

1382
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and subscribe guys I do have a patreon

1383
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
you can find that on the channel page

1384
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't gate keep content all of my

1385
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
research as everybody knows is open source

1386
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
so only support what

1387
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
you think the channel is worth

1388
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
you're not getting much extra there it's just

1389
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
go help me out make these investigations

1390
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
purchasing better camera equipment because

1391
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
as everybody can see this camera isn't great

1392
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
and you know maybe funding

1393
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
my trips to go speak to witnesses

1394
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
which I do plan to do quite soon so

1395
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
thank you so much again for joining me and

1396
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I will catch everybody on the next show

1397
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
later everybody thanks
