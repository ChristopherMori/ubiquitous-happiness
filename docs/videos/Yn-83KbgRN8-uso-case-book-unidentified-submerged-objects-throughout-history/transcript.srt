1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
The United States most well-known UFO investigation panels, Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,320
ran from 1949 to 1969 and collected data on more than 13,000 UFO sightings.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,560
Of this massive body of sightings, 258 cases reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,360
percentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or transmedium objects.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,480
Of course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out, 1952's OpNav Directive

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,760
3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,080
Center, USAF Intelligence, and Director of Naval Intelligence.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,320
So it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
But what about the cases we do have?

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
And what other cases that don't appear in Blue Book that span our history are worth

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
our time?

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,320
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
history.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,120
From Blue Book to the modern day to pre-World War I, let's analyze reported cases of unidentified

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,720
submerged objects.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,640
And guys, today we will not just be sticking with the US, but analyzing global cases I

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,120
find worth studying.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:26,000
As mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Blue Book cases, aka 258 reports, involved sea

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,040
sightings of UFOs.

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,280
And 13 of these reports can be classified as good, meeting merit standards for UFO reporting,

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,240
and a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and transmedium objects.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Found in the annals of Blue Book indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,280
from the ship Marcala on August 4, 1950.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Shockingly, this case is listed by Blue Book as unidentified, and may in fact be my favorite

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,560
case I will discuss today.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,080
At 10pm EDT, the shipmaster, chief mate, and third mate of the MV Marcala saw an unidentified

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,760
elliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest heading northeast.

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,520
Passing within 1,000 feet of the ship, the object hovered no more than 100 feet above

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,000
sea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,160
This object was described as ovular, cylindrically shaped and elliptical, like half an egg cut

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,680
lengthwise.

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,080
The object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,480
All three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,000
passed closely over the ocean.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,360
This event lasted roughly a minute.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,280
We can also hop on board the SS city of Almaco, heading from Yokohama to LA just north of

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,320
the Hawaiian Islands on November 7, 1959.

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,440
Three witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
from four miles north of the ship.

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,200
The light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface, and remember those three

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,360
flashes as they'll come up later.

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,680
The Almaco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,240
Blue Book labeled this case as a meteor, but while such a prosaic explanation might be

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,680
possible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
for an extended time period warrants more investigation.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,000
And if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate near the vicinity

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,920
of Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June 1960.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,360
At 2334 local time, an Operation Range Vessel, co-named Whiskey, was retrieving the data cassette

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,440
from a missile test labeled 1802.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
The small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette, illuminated by strobes

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,920
and monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above.

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,680
As the smaller boat got within three to five hundred yards of the strobe, the crew observed

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,800
a steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,820
and roughly 25 degrees from their boat.

55
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,680
This light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
over the light.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,480
The event lasted for 10 seconds and was spotted by the RCA photographer, test observer, divers

58
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,360
of the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and co-pilot of the recovery plane.

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,280
Blue Book claimed this sighting was a flare, however.

60
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,080
It was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site.

61
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,600
And this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,560
in my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data observed a massive

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
USO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile.

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,520
And speaking of rushed Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,640
the 11th of January 1966.

66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Near 1,000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate Helmsman and bow lookout observed a cigar

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,000
shaped object approach their ship.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,760
The cigar object glowed with an orange-yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,960
a body with a duller glow.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,360
The body had two lights on top and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,820
long and 35 to 40 feet in length.

72
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,360
The object neared the starboard side of the ship from the horizon and then turned 180 degrees

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,800
to avoid going over the vessel.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,200
It approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400 feet.

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,760
After hovering for 30 seconds, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,660
changed directions.

77
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,680
This incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea.

78
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,060
The shipmaster believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search.

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,180
Blue Book identified this case as the Cosmos 33 satellite decay, however, this explanation

80
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,600
does not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes.

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,100
If you would like to read more on ship-based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF

82
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,100
on Maritime UFO and USO research in Blue Book.

83
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,060
This stat-rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Blue Book sightings

84
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,060
between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

85
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:14,300
Of the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific.

86
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,340
This data highlights while there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot,

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,620
UFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water.

88
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,340
Historically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports.

89
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,860
In fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive if not more than our own here in the United

90
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,220
States.

91
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,420
One day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not

92
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,180
the topic of our video today because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO

93
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,100
reports that are indeed worth investigating.

94
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,060
I will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO Secrets by Paul Stonehill

95
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,020
and Philip Mantle, however, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy

96
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,700
of note and can track down additional reporting on.

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,860
Many of these cases are just stories and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified

98
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,780
files like we do with Blue Book, so I will be doing my best to vet these cases.

99
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,580
Let's dive into a handful of the most interesting.

100
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,500
On October 7, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents

101
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Sea.

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,180
Its radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles.

103
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,660
The Volga's Captain Tarantyn approached the bridge to see nine bright disks moving in

104
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,380
from the northeast.

105
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,860
The disks arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes.

106
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,740
During the encounter, ship comlinks malfunctioned, similar to the major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran

107
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,540
UFO incident.

108
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,140
After the disks depart, the ship comms and operations return to normal.

109
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,020
Raising concern in the Soviet Navy, fleet admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov, known

110
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,860
as the Likr, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic

111
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,940
scientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to JANAP-146C and OpNAP Directive 3820.

112
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:20,060
The directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. Asaza and signed

113
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,660
by Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr Novoitsev.

114
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,180
This case was not only discussed in Russia's USO Secrets, but also in Jacques Valais'

115
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,820
book UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union, a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30.

116
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,700
The link to the book, free of course, will be in the video description, so check that

117
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,060
out for yourself.

118
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,940
Kamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia.

119
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,380
The almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Akhatsk from the Pacific Ocean.

120
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,140
According to Russia's USO Secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin

121
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,660
Solomchakov, on a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting

122
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,900
research within a motorboat on Kamchatka Lake.

123
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,020
Suddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of

124
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,460
the lake, in which rose a grey-colored oval object, estimated to be 40 to 60 meters in

125
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,820
length.

126
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,900
The object rose to an altitude of nearly 100 meters and hovered motionlessly.

127
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,020
As it did, the motorboat engine stalled, horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated

128
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,100
away rapidly, restoring functions to their engine.

129
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,780
What fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we

130
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,260
see Kevin Knuth discuss at the Sol Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from

131
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,180
vehicles.

132
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,900
In the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I

133
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,260
have heard.

134
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,500
This information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Ziggle, one of Russia's

135
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,060
most well-respected ufologists.

136
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,340
On June 15, 77, the Soviet ship Novolkuznetsk navigated the Gulf of Gayaquil, Ecuador,

137
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,260
a radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent

138
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
sphere rose from the water.

139
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,420
It flew around the ship, hovered 20 meters over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged, and

140
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,460
dove back into the water.

141
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,540
And with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

142
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,180
I'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on USOs from 2006,

143
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,780
where we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon.

144
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,380
I highly recommend checking out this whole documentary, and of course the link will be

145
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,180
in the description.

146
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,020
But one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO slash USO government documentation is

147
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,420
Australia.

148
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:23,220
The Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers, and files on anomalous

149
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
sightings.

150
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,860
In fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported, UAS Unusual

151
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,580
Aerial Sighting, occurred on January 23rd, 1964, and describes, quote, seen at sea by

152
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,180
crew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia.

153
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,940
Large lights and water made compass go haywire, shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise,

154
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,620
causing lights to pulsate, end quote.

155
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,780
The tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO-USO encounters

156
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,140
and certainly not missed by Australia.

157
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,660
A report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting.

158
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,820
Around this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings

159
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,060
seriously.

160
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,080
See these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included

161
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,100
alongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman

162
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,060
observing a light shoot up from the water, hover, and disappear.

163
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,820
Australian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters very

164
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,100
similar to both the fisherman encounter and our 1977 Soviet encounter.

165
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,100
This 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and

166
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,380
local Aussies observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height, curve

167
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,700
and return to the oceans.

168
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,740
Many of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes once returned to sea.

169
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,900
We're back to our SS City of Almaco case in Project Blue Book.

170
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,540
It is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized

171
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,980
these could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams, however this

172
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,340
does not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and

173
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,180
Americans.

174
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,140
Outside of the Australian government, the citizens of the land down under have some fascinating

175
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,860
stories of USOs.

176
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,220
shooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers.

177
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:38,420
In 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederick Walter and Emma Flavel observed five gray oblong

178
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,080
objects, rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast.

179
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,420
This sighting was also observed by two railroad workers who described five white or light

180
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,260
pink egg shaped objects, rise from the sea but with the added detail of quivering, similar

181
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,860
to our MV Marcolla case mentioned earlier in the video.

182
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,820
Cigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history.

183
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,260
Around the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a

184
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,700
case that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review, 1966-67.

185
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,680
Private pilot C. Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing four or five

186
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,120
mysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island.

187
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,320
Approaching the objects from the sky, there appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow

188
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,440
and up to 100 feet long accompanied by three smaller objects.

189
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,600
The two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the

190
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,040
aircraft approached within two miles.

191
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,640
Initially thought to be whales or submarines, the men in independent sightings from nearby

192
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:54,080
Seabrae Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost

193
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,680
like they did not interact with the water.

194
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,240
This interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the HMNZS Southland case Knuth describes

195
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,920
at the Seoul Foundation, which oddly enough occurred near New Zealand.

196
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,200
We all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he

197
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,000
and his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle

198
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,400
of the ocean in the middle of the night.

199
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,120
But I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case.

200
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,080
What I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th

201
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,000
century that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau.

202
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,280
On November 12, 1887, Captain R.F. Moore of the English steamer the SS Siberian encountered

203
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,320
a USO 10 nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland.

204
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,440
The captain observed an enormous fireball.

205
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,960
Rise from the sea to 50 feet, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky.

206
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,920
At the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and

207
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,640
most difficult to explain electrical phenomena.

208
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,200
But as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea.

209
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,600
In Africa, the Gulf of Guinea 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed

210
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,040
an immense object sinking into the ocean.

211
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,880
The cigar shaped object measured nearly 200 meters long and 300 meters wide.

212
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,040
As the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights

213
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,120
lit at the front and two blue-green lights shining at the other end.

214
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,320
This case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine.

215
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,600
However, seen as popular submarines at this time such as the early German U-boat measured

216
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:48,040
solely 41 meters long, I still find this case anomalous.

217
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,320
And now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel.

218
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,120
Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon

219
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
observed by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere.

220
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,800
And it's worthy to note, this just wasn't an isolated incident.

221
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,880
In fact, the Maritime Light Wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned

222
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
earlier.

223
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,400
We had information that in the ocean, in the seas, in our inner seas,

224
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,880
there were cases of some kind of strange phenomena related to the light of water.

225
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,680
October of 1969, the Arabian Sea.

226
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,640
The command of the Soviet scientific vessel Vladimir Vorobyev unexpectedly woke up

227
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,360
without any sign of fear.

228
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,600
The instruments showed that the massive object was at a depth of 20 meters.

229
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,520
It was still one and a half hundred meters long.

230
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
They ran to the deck.

231
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,120
No, this is not a submarine, as we thought at first.

232
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,680
In the depths of the sea, against the clock arrow, slightly bent,

233
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,680
there were eight bright rays of the length of 200 meters.

234
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,400
The fiery continued for more than half an hour.

235
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Then the spot fell apart into several parts and disappeared.

236
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
Two years before that, the source of light was able to be seen.

237
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
It was in 1967, in the Samzalivi.

238
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
The sailors of several Dutch ships then observed the rotation of huge

239
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
glowing wheels on the water.

240
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
And from the Glenfolle hot spring, it was clearly seen that the object

241
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
that was shining on the water was 20-30 meters in diameter.

242
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
What was it?

243
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
The question remained unanswered.

244
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
In the sea, many times, there were glowing wheels

245
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
that our famous construction engineer, Krylov, called

246
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
underwater ghosts.

247
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
The size of the wheels is sometimes huge, up to several kilometers.

248
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
And many times, they can be seen even from space.

249
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
They are rarely moved, and quite quickly.

250
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
The brightness of the glow on the surface of the sea is such that

251
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
the glare is sometimes visible on the clouds.

252
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
What is it? Without the glow of microorganisms?

253
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
But how to explain the amazing symmetry

254
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
and the huge speed of rotation of the light wheels?

255
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Sometimes the clouds slip on the surface of the sea

256
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
with the speed of a racing car.

257
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Microorganisms cannot move so quickly.

258
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Moreover, the test of water from the wheels often shows

259
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
that there are no even traces of the glowing plankton.

260
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
The light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by

261
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
spokes of brilliant white light.

262
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
That can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air,

263
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
serving as a possibly trans-medium craft.

264
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I must note, also as they talked about in the video,

265
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
some attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction

266
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
between bioluminescent algae and pressure waves

267
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
in an otherwise calm water. However,

268
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus

269
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
on the existence. But let's review the earliest sightings

270
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
of these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many,

271
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
many more sightings of the maritime light wheel

272
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
that have been observed, but I just want to recount a few of the earliest.

273
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
On March 27th, 1873,

274
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
the ship Adelheid voyage from Leban to Singapore.

275
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Captain Ledman noticed a peculiar, blinding,

276
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
milky white light. Appear beneath the waves

277
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
about two ship lengths from the vessel.

278
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Flakes of light described as, quote, flakes of snow

279
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
when driven over the rocks by a strong wind, end quote.

280
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
The light followed the ship traveling at four to five knots

281
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
for roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing.

282
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Ledman stated he had not seen anything like this

283
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
in his 26 years of maritime life.

284
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
We can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia,

285
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
mentioned in an 1873 news article in the Argus.

286
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
An almost USO flap

287
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
was experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901.

288
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
An initial USO sighting

289
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
was reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans,

290
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
a hydrographer for the British Navy on May 15th, 1879.

291
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,600
J. E. Pringle of the HMS Vulture

292
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,600
reported, quote, luminous waves

293
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
or pulsations in the water,

294
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
moving at great speed, end quote, passing under the vulture.

295
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
It was at this time Pringle noticed two objects

296
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
in the east and west, what appeared to be, quote,

297
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
revolving wheels with a center on that bearing

298
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
and whose spokes were illuminated, end quote.

299
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Worthy to note, these two wheels were rotating

300
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
in equal and opposite directions, and the spokes

301
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
were about 25 feet in length.

302
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
It is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water

303
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
as the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here.

304
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
The second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880

305
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,600
by British India Company steamer Patna.

306
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Captain Avern, Mr. Manning Third Officer

307
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
and others observed two enormous luminous wheels

308
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
appear on each side of the ship near 11.30 p.m.

309
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
The wheels were, quote, whirling around,

310
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
the spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship.

311
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
The spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long

312
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
and resemble the birch rods of the Dame School.

313
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Each wheel contained about 16 spokes,

314
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
and the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter.

315
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
The spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around, end quote.

316
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
The men described the appearance of the spokes

317
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
could almost be represented by standing in a boat

318
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
and flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally

319
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
along the surface of the water, round and round.

320
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
The final Persian encounter with this USO

321
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
was observed on April 4th, 1901,

322
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
where Captain Hosean of the steamship Kila encountered, quote,

323
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Vash shafts of light suddenly appeared.

324
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Shaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea,

325
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
but it was only a faint light and in about 15 minutes died out,

326
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,600
having appeared suddenly and having died out gradually.

327
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,600
These shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour.

328
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
From earlier the year of 1880, I just mentioned,

329
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,600
this wheel-like object was possibly seen off the Malabar coast of India

330
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
on January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan.

331
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Ari Harris describes a clear night over calm waters,

332
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
stars shining bright and no moon present.

333
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
At roughly 10 p.m. Harris and the shift's third officer

334
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
noticed a milky white circle in the sky,

335
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
resembling, quote, the nebulae sometimes seen in the heavens.

336
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Approaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel

337
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
to try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object

338
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
and its waves of light.

339
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
The last old example here I will cover

340
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
occurred on the 10th of June, 1909

341
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
and was actually featured in Scientific American,

342
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,600
issue 106-51, which relays

343
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
the Nautical Meteorological Annual

344
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,600
published by the Danish Meteorological Institute,

345
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
a report on a quote, singular phenomena.

346
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
While sailing through the Straits of Malacca,

347
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Captain Gabe of the SS Bintang

348
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
observed a vast revolving wheel of light under the water,

349
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
quote, long arms issuing from a center

350
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
around which the whole system appeared to rotate, end quote.

351
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Surfacing, this wheel was so vast,

352
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
that half of it could be seen at a time

353
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
with the center laying near the horizon,

354
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
the wheel was able to move forward

355
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
and vary in speed and rotation,

356
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
disappearing when the center was right under the vessel.

357
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
And like our last 1880 case,

358
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
these maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water.

359
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
In the same Danish Meteorological Institute,

360
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,600
there reports another instance in 1910,

361
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,600
where Captain Breyer of the Dutch steamship Valencien

362
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
was sailing in the South China Sea.

363
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Here, the captain, first and second mate

364
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
and the first engineer all observed

365
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
an object hovering above the water, quote,

366
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,600
it looked like a horizontal wheel, rapidly turning.

367
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
My friends, thank you so much for watching today,

368
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
as we took a deeper dive into USOs throughout history.

369
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Please excuse the rash guard I'm wearing,

370
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I just got home from training, but phalanx if you're watching,

371
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I'm always open for a sponsor.

372
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
But anyways guys, I got such a great reaction

373
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
from my first video on USO, I had to make a follow up

374
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
and show that it doesn't matter what time period we're in,

375
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
it doesn't matter what country we're in,

376
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
there are stories of unexplained things in the water.

377
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
As far as the maritime light wheel goes,

378
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
I'm pretty torn on that whether that is a craft object

379
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
or possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena.

380
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'll include in the video description

381
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
a kind of not really debunk but a paper,

382
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,600
kind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena,

383
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
but still, the fact that these are seen in the Persian Gulf,

384
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
in Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me,

385
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
but even more fascinating to me are Australian,

386
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Blue Book, and Soviet Files.

387
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
All depicting very similar experiences,

388
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
tic-tac-shaped craft, slash cigars,

389
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
fireballs exiting the water,

390
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,600
fireballs exiting the water that are almost curious about the ship,

391
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
egg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists,

392
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,600
but we see multiple cases of these sort of lightballs

393
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
leaving the water dancing around

394
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
and shooting off into the sky or back into the water.

395
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
As far as the tic-tacs go,

396
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
we often see these things hovering slightly above water

397
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
and multiple cases saying they're quivering or gyrating

398
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
or slowly submerging under the water

399
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
but not affecting the water surface

400
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
similar to the case Kevin Knuth talks about.

401
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,600
So I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena

402
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
by looking in our oceans.

403
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,600
There's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about,

404
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
but couldn't really find reputable sources for,

405
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
such as some Chilean incidents

406
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
that supposedly in the military,

407
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
a fleet of saucers approached a craft.

408
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,600
But until then, we'll just keep digging in case files.

409
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,600
It's a shame that there's not a lot of information at Blue Book.

410
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,600
We can thank OPNAV3820 and JANAP146C for that,

411
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
but we'll work with what we're given.

412
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
If one day I can get in contact with George Knapp

413
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,600
and see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia

414
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
pertain to USO, I would very much like to do that.

415
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
But where I stand now,

416
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,600
USO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon.

417
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
The fact that these craft can operate in air

418
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
or under sea trans-medium objects

419
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
without really changing their flight characteristics

420
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
is insane to me.

421
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
So if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary,

422
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
it's actually really darn good.

423
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
I highly suggest watching it.

424
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,600
It does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USOs.

425
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
And of course, you can listen to someone talk in a Russian accent

426
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
for 45 minutes, so that's great.

427
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
As always, guys, thank you so much for watching.

428
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately,

429
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
with the Kingman video and getting retweeted by Ross.

430
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
So that's been great.

431
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I love all of you guys.

432
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Thanks so much for being here.

433
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Remember to like and retweet.

434
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Leave a comment on the video.

435
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Let me know what you think.

436
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Let me know what cases, crashes, whatever you want me to tackle next.

437
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
That has to do with the phenomenon, of course.

438
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Nothing random.

439
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
So just let me know.

440
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
And again, thanks for being here, guys.

441
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I'll catch you on the next video.
