0	4880	When you hear of a program called the Off-World Technologies Division, you might think of the
4880	10000	U.S. Army's brief in-house group known as the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit that analyzed UFOs
10000	15280	in the 1950s. Or maybe you think of the U.S. Air Force's foreign technology division initially
15280	20480	achieved by Colonel Philip J. Corso, who stated technology such as night vision and fiber optics
20480	26400	were reverse engineered for the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. Whatever you think of when you
26480	31440	hear of the Off-World Technologies Division, there is a first-hand witness who can shed
31440	38080	light on this never-before-heard-of, non-human-intelligence technology exploitation program.
38080	43280	A witness whose claims can be backed by his U.S. Army Green Beret and Special Forces credentials
43280	48240	and verified placement where he claims this anomalous division is stored. It was within
48240	54080	this division stored at the Naval Surface Weapon Center in Crane, Indiana. Green Beret witness
54080	61120	R.A. observed recovered technology not made by human hands. Technology so profound,
61120	66560	strange, and advanced, it seemed the Navy and a certain private company's best and brightest
66560	72560	could not begin to comprehend this tech. What's going on guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so
72560	78960	much for joining me today as we hear from for the first time ever, the first-hand witness testimony
79040	86000	of Special Forces member R.A. in his claims of an Off-World Technologies Division at the NSWC Crane.
86640	92160	R.A.'s testimony may reveal a disturbing and monumental UFO reverse engineering program
92160	97680	nestled within the Navy's premier special weaponry installation. Join me as we conduct an
97680	103680	astounding primary investigation into R.A. his claims and a private defense contractor likely
103680	107440	involved with UFO technology reverse engineering programs.
112080	118480	To start, who exactly is R.A. and why should his testimony be heard? R.A. is easily the most
118480	123200	accomplished and credentialed U.S. soldier I have ever had the pleasure of speaking to. R.A.
123200	129280	is a U.S. Army Special Forces operator, aka a Green Beret, who served within the first Special Forces
129280	135040	Airborne Command. He served as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant, a key element to any Special Forces
135040	139360	division described by the U.S. Army as one of the most highly skilled soldiers in the world.
140080	145920	18 Bravos are tasked with operating and maintaining an array of weaponry, including small arms,
145920	152000	heavy weapons, bombs, and mines, communications equipment, and must be able to employ conventional
152000	157680	and unconventional warfare tactics, and guys this is key. Operate and maintain both allied
157680	162080	and foreign weaponry. His Special Forces accolades have been thoroughly vetted,
162080	167920	with R.A. providing a full list of his certifications as well as his DD 214. He also
167920	173920	completed SEAR, Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape High-Risk Training at Level C,
173920	178960	which is the hardest and most challenging SEAR course. The witness even completed the U.S.
178960	184240	Army's ALC, or Advanced Learning Course, and earned a T.S.S.C.I. Top Secret Sensitive
184320	190000	Compartmented Information Security Clearance. I was connected to R.A. through mutual contacts,
190000	195360	who told me that this R.A. wanted to help disclosure, wanted to tell about his experience,
195360	206080	but wanted to remain anonymous. Between 2013 and 2015, R.A. was sent to the Naval
206080	211520	Surface Warfare Center, located in Crane, Indiana, to train with advanced foreign and domestic
211600	215360	weapon technologies, and their implementation into the armed forces.
215920	221280	The Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC, as I'll be referring it to for the rest of this video,
221280	226560	is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane, alongside the U.S. Army Ammunition Activity,
226560	231920	which stockpiles much of the U.S. mainland's munitions. Crane, Indiana was chosen for these
231920	236880	stockpile duties during World War II, as such a landlocked state location would be difficult to
236880	243120	be targeted by enemy forces. Quote, NSA Crane, home to one of the nation's most important
243120	249680	military laboratories, is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best-kept secret, end quote,
249680	256320	Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana. NSWC is an enormous facility, with several underground layers
256320	261280	highlighted as the premier Navy lab, whose mission is to, quote, provide acquisition and
261280	266800	in-service engineering and technical support for sensors, electronics, electronic warfare,
266800	271280	and special warfare weapons, end quote. Operations at Crane are divided into three
271280	277120	distinct focus areas, strategic missions, electronic warfare, and expeditionary warfare.
277120	281280	But this location doesn't focus just on conventional missions, such as we see in this
281280	285600	recent Duke University research funding announcement titled Long Range Broad Agency
285600	292560	announcement for NSWC Crane. A key focus of Crane programs are advanced concepts and technologies.
293200	298560	NSWC Crane is best described as a Navy federal laboratory with a reputation for national
298560	303680	technical leadership, and a Navy lab that works directly with warfighters to create
303680	309360	comprehensive, innovative solutions at the speed of relevance. The underground presence of this
309360	314800	base is also key to mention here moving forward. Not only are there numerous underground bunkers
314800	319760	for munitions storage hidden below the ground, but also small arms testing resources such as an
319760	326240	underground 100-meter firing range. The naval support activity location holds over 3,000 buildings
326240	334160	spanning 64,000 acres above ground. NSWC Crane is deeply tied to private defense contractors,
334160	340720	employing over 2,489 private contract workers, including one in specific, we will mention in
340720	346400	a little bit. As mentioned before, RA was at Crane to test advanced foreign and domestic weaponry.
346400	351120	The Crane facility has historically worked closely with the U.S. Army for weapons testing,
351120	356160	training, and defensive capabilities, such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq.
356720	363360	And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering, quote, critical technology to maintain fleet
363360	368720	readiness, end quote, such as this black box that was, quote, unknown how it was constructed,
368800	373680	functioned, or how to repair it, end quote. This device was successfully reverse engineered by
373680	380240	electromagnetic warfare experts and designated as critical technology in an AN-SLQ-32 or
380240	386400	SLIC-32 component, a ship-board electronic warfare suite. Also interesting and worthy of note,
386400	392080	NSWC has to adhere to DOD guidebooks for, quote, situations such as this, end quote.
392800	397760	So let's hear from RA for the first time. In his words, why was he at Crane?
398080	403360	It was for a weapons course. So we were, we were specifically going there to train up on the new
403360	410000	Maygun setup and a couple other, like, SOCOM weapons that were coming in, coming online,
410000	417360	like iterations to the SCAR, so some cases that were coming in, and then also to get educated on
417360	422880	some of the enemy technology. So whenever we'd be training like that, that's like TSSCI level
422880	429920	stuff. They'll have stuff that's, for example, they'll have a description of the course and what
429920	433520	you're going to do, and then all the stuff that's going to, that you're going to get taught that's
433520	442400	not able to be written down or, you know, exposed. It'll be, they'll explain that in a different
442400	448400	way. So I would say that. It's like, we knew we were going to get exposed to some other
448400	453840	foreign weapons that they had, they had recently recovered, and we were supposed to kind of just
453840	459920	help provide an input on what we thought about those systems. And they did have them there. They
459920	465040	had some Russian weapons that had bullets that they were, they think they could, Russian force
465040	471200	firing with biologics and bullets. And so we had, we were doing some stuff with that. And so it was,
471200	476800	it was looking at other foreign weapon systems that they were, they were spinning around with,
476880	482000	and the CIA operatives had captured and that they go back to Crain. So if you think about it, like
482000	487920	whatever mechanism they have, logistically, to get that shit from wherever they found it to Crain,
487920	491280	why would they not use that same apparatus to get whatever else they find?
491280	497040	RA was told that out of his class of about 10, him and only one other soldier with TSSCI clearance
497040	501920	would be taken to see the interesting stuff, the quote, foreign adversarial tech.
501920	504720	Yes. So the way that it was kind of weird how that happened, there was only, so there was a
504720	508480	bunch of us in the class, I forget, I mean, you saw a picture, there was only two of us in that
508480	515920	group that had a TSSCI level clearance at the time. And those were the two, we were the two that
515920	521280	got taken to see the other stuff. So they were, the rest of the class didn't see the foreign weapons
522080	526640	they were back in engineering or the awful technology that they had exposed us to. So
527280	530800	nobody else saw that. And then we were also told not to mention next to the rest of the class
531760	534640	that we were the ones getting exposed to that technology. So
535360	540800	after observing tech considered disruptive, such as the experimental Russian bullets RA spoke of,
540800	545120	him and his fellow soldier were taken deep underground to a location that stood out from
545120	552960	the rest of Crain, appearing pristine and quite advanced. We went down into like an R&D area,
552960	560160	that's where it had on-vrooms. So the on-vroom is going to be like an extra layer of security,
560160	565200	right? And then, so it's kind of what it was, we went through a couple checkpoints. I mean,
565200	568480	I remember going through like a door to get to a door to get to that, like that kind of
569520	574560	like compartmentalized, like whether who knows what they were scanning, I don't know,
574560	581680	they're probably checking us for whatever. Obviously, it was like considered like a scare.
581680	587760	So we give up all electronics and everything before we even went down there. So I mean,
587760	591600	you're scrubbed, you know, everything possibly, you don't have anything that could take a note with
591600	597440	or something, you know, you're scrubbed with everything. So then you go through, we went down
597440	602320	the elevator, and like I said, it was, I could tell you're a lower pretty low, because I remember
602320	606880	it being like one outside and then down there it was really cold, just because of the depths.
606880	611840	So we had to be some significant amount below the surface, I don't know how far at all, but
612800	620320	um, and then I went through the checkpoints and then into an arms room area, which is what we're
620320	626480	shocking about again, is that all of crane was old and dilapidated and beat up. I mean, it looks like
626480	631680	in 1970s facility, and you go underground in this area, and it was like a spaceship, you know,
631680	636320	not literally, but I mean, it was so much more advanced than the stuff up top. Like you can
636320	639760	tell this is where the, the shit happened. You know, this is where they maintained and
639760	644800	upgraded and continued to work and all the other stuff that just kind of like let look like shit
644800	651680	on purpose problem. Nothing in crane was labeled. All the buildings were, I mean, like really basic
651680	659280	looking. When we were under, in that particular area, there was, there was labeling on like
659280	665280	different areas. So there was like, I remember seeing a couple signs, I don't know what they
665280	670400	said, I mean, so long ago now, but um, yeah, there was like signage like saying what part you were
670400	676320	in. And what struck me is why I remember that, I think, is because like, I was thinking how big is
676320	680720	this underground area that they have to label where you're at, you know, because if you think about it,
680720	685200	I mean, if we just took an elevator down to the area that was small, then why would you label it?
685200	690240	Oh, this is where you are here. And it felt like it was falling, not like it was this one little area,
690240	696560	you know, it was under the NSWC crane, RA would arrive to observe the off world technologies
696560	706800	division. RA was told by his guide, a private contractor, former military and the same individual
706800	712240	leading the weapons training, quite nonchalantly that they were entering the quote, off world
712240	718000	technologies division end quote. And before he expands on an I asked RA his initial reaction
718000	723840	when he was told quite casually about the division's name. Well, I mean, I was a trained
723840	728320	green beret, so my reaction was stoic, but when I got back to the hotel, I was freaking out.
729040	733920	I mean, because up to that point, I had, I had believed in like, obviously that there were,
734800	738240	you know, probably aliens out there, probably life out there in the universe, of course,
738800	745120	just statistically speaking, but I never thought that I wouldn't have gone as far as if they'd
745120	749040	been here or any of that. But to then to see that these guys were talking about like, was like,
749040	753920	over a coffee break. I was really surprised by that. And me and the other guy had a great
753920	758480	conversation about it when we got back. And it was kind of just like, now what? Because
759280	763040	like the whole world is different to me. And it took me a lot of years. I thought about that for
763040	768240	a lot of years, just was this mean for me, you know? Yeah, I mean, there's a part of me that
768240	773440	was grateful that I got that I know, but that I know I can at least within myself, I can say,
774000	777120	I know that there's another life out there, you know, and I know it because
778000	782240	I was exposed to it in this way. However, that happened. Now I know, you know, and that's,
782240	786880	I'm grateful for that. But at the same time, I don't know what the cost of that's going to end
786880	793360	up being, you know, upon entering this unlabeled division, RA did not enter a normal firing range
793360	798800	or laboratory. He and the other men were greeted to what seemed like a scientific observation
798800	805360	room overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology. So it was, it was basically the
805360	812560	way I would describe it is like a viewing room. And I think it was, you can imagine, like they're
812560	818640	probably we're going to do different types of experiments on these objects and, and the area
818640	823360	that they kept it in or stored it in, you know, or maybe they will just have this setup to be a
823360	826640	piece to come through and look at it, people that weren't there, we're going to the people
826640	830800	that know about this technology. I don't know. But it's clearly set up in a way that
830800	835840	you could see the room that it was displayed in a way that was looked like it was displayed.
835840	839920	I don't know. It was very, it's very possible that they were, it was both on that stuff and
839920	844720	somebody would have drove them from the area we were in. solely RA, the other green beret,
844720	850480	the guide and one staff member were present. The contractor present was quote, pretty normally
850480	856240	dressed and quote, appearing similar to a normal lab technician. One of these devices displayed
856320	862480	was a sphere no bigger than a basketball and seemingly constructed from seamless metal.
862480	869840	Yeah, I don't know. So hard to describe. It just, it looked unnatural. The, the sphere itself was on
869840	875120	like a podium type of thing. And it, from what I could see, it didn't look like it was connected
875120	881360	to the podium. It looked like it was almost repelled off the podium. It was a very, it was a
881360	890640	awkwardly, like almost looked liquid, but it was clearly metallic, seamless.
892960	898080	It just didn't look natural, man. Like if you, if you took a chrome ball the same size,
898080	901680	chrome sphere, polish it up and put it in that room, it would look different than that.
902560	906640	But I can't tell you how, because I don't have anything to reference to that.
906880	912640	It just didn't look right. It didn't look, it looked different than anything I've ever seen.
913440	917440	If you brought that ball in a room to me right now, I was like, this is from another world.
918000	921920	Nobody would doubt that. Everybody in the room would probably be like, yeah, that's something
921920	926320	weird about that, you know? I wondered if this sphere's surface description was similar to the
926320	930320	mother of pearl effect Lance Corporal Jonathan Weighant claimed to have observed from the
930320	936880	crashed UAP in Peru in 1997. RA described this sphere as extremely clear, and the mother of
936880	943120	pearl effect could be accurate if we utilize an oil on water analogy, but with the oil being clear.
943120	948080	RA claimed the sphere had an indent on top that almost looked like where one would put a hand,
948080	950640	but did not get a crystal clear look at this.
951520	955040	About the size of the hand, I wouldn't say there was forehand,
957440	961680	because that would be, I mean, that's my human interpretation of what I would think it would
961680	967280	do, you know? RA's guide told him and the other Green Beret this object and the other piece of
967280	972720	technology somehow interacted with human consciousness. Both the audience they had under
972720	976560	there, they said somehow interacted with consciousness in it, and the way he said it,
976800	985680	and it was why it gets so fuzzy. He said, I wouldn't quote these things, because I'm kind of trying
985680	993600	to just remember the context, and I can, again, like when I meditate, I think about this, I can
993600	999120	usually get more back, but just like sitting here talking and remembering it, it's difficult sometimes.
999120	1005760	But I remember him saying, we don't understand quite how to operate the systems or how they,
1005760	1009520	but they do interact with consciousness. So certain, and some people they interact with,
1009520	1015200	and some people they don't. So certain people will go up to the object and it will respond,
1015200	1018720	and some people go up to the object and it does nothing. So certain types, I don't know if that's
1018720	1024320	related to DNA or to consciousness or whatever, but it's different people will have a different
1024320	1032000	response, and they, they has kind of walked closer to the window, and nothing happened. So we didn't,
1032000	1034880	I mean, I don't know if we got closer to something would have happened, but I don't know if they
1035120	1040000	were even looking for that. But maybe, you know, that's one thing he said that like certain people
1040000	1044880	will go near the object and it will react. He didn't describe how it would react, he said it would react.
1045600	1050160	RA states, once he began to view the pieces of technology, his recollection of these events
1050160	1054480	becomes somewhat fuzzy. There's a really weird component to this, and I don't know what this
1054480	1059680	means. But when I think back to this particular memory, and this never happens to me in any other
1059680	1067040	thing, I get real fuzzy. It gets real fuzzy, like almost like something was purposely done to make
1067040	1071520	it that way. Because I have a very photographic memory and things I've done in the military,
1071520	1078800	like I can tell you the color, the buttons on a shirt of a guy, I snipe from, you know, 800 meters away.
1078800	1086720	So, I mean, for me to not remember this is really bothers me, but there's some cloudiness when I
1086720	1091440	try to access this part of my brain, you know. Maybe it could definitely be the
1092880	1098000	objects themselves that have been. It felt, this is why it's a good quote, because obviously,
1098000	1103280	it felt weird being down there, okay? There's something like, there was just, it's an unnatural
1103280	1109200	feeling. It felt like we were doing something that wasn't normal. I mean, the fact that we were so
1109200	1113600	deep underground, me and the dude were kind of freaked out, but we didn't display that
1113600	1119040	outwardly, because we're trained to not do that. But internally, I was like, what the hell is going
1119040	1124400	on? And when they talk about awkward stuff, they didn't say it like, by the way, aliens are real,
1124400	1128800	like you're anything like of that sort. It was just, oh yeah, this is the awkward technology
1128800	1133520	division. This is Chuck, this is whatever. And just started talking like everything was normal.
1133520	1138640	And we just went along with it because we hadn't thought it was normal. But the first time I'd
1138640	1143920	ever been exposed to it. And it was a lot to take in. So that can be part of it too.
1144560	1149280	Immediately, let's recall the infographics witness whistleblower who claimed anchors were
1149280	1155280	utilized by UAP recovery operators to keep them quote grounded in reality. Dr. Gary Nolan has
1155280	1161360	also done extensive research into the effect of UAP on human cognition. Whatever the phenomenon is,
1162160	1168560	it's capable of manipulating human perception, human consciousness. Right.
1169200	1175280	The other piece of technology R.A. observed is very difficult to describe. He sees it almost as
1175280	1179920	a tablet similar to a gauntlet, something you would put your arm inside. R.A. stated this
1179920	1185440	second device was referred to as a piece of weapon technology, due to the tech producing an energetic
1185440	1189280	discharge during recovery. And same with the other the other thing that looked like something you
1189360	1195440	would put your arm inside, as I described. And supposedly with some type of weapon system that
1195440	1200240	they had recovered from the craft, they knew as a weapon system because it had it had discharged
1200240	1206000	or something, an energy pulse. And they just had talked about that briefly. But all this was like
1206000	1210960	third party saying what they had heard about the object. So they were talking about it between
1210960	1215600	the two guys that worked there. And I think they exposed more than they were supposed to in just
1215680	1219440	in their conversation. And I don't know that they weren't really trying to be
1220240	1223280	much secure with what they were saying. They're pretty comfortable or they've been
1223280	1228080	dealing with this stuff for a while. And this wasn't a big deal to them. So that that was awfully,
1228080	1231760	as you can imagine, because I'm getting exposed to something that's telling me that everything I
1231760	1235840	believe about the world is different. And I'm freaking out inside. And these guys were talking
1235840	1240800	about it like it's no big deal. Like we're at lunch. He said that it was an uncomfortable feeling.
1240800	1246160	But yeah, he he described this stuff. Because I don't remember asking questions.
1247680	1251120	I'll never be like, well, what's it what how did you know this weapon? How do you know that's
1251120	1257120	a weapon? And he said, Oh, they had discharged in the process of them recovering it, that they
1257120	1263120	had discharged an energy pulse or something. Somebody was injured in the process. And they were
1263120	1267760	talking about it a little bit. And then the guy would be like, Oh, remember, they had something
1268720	1272320	other guy would be like, Oh, yeah. And then he was taken to that hospital or whatever.
1274240	1277440	They were talking about it like they were filling each other reminding each other of
1277440	1280640	something about the incident, you know, and that's how we got the information.
1280640	1286320	This weapon technology device was projecting a type of writing that reminded RA of hieroglyphics.
1287200	1288720	I don't know how to describe that man.
1291440	1292880	Almost hieroglyphic, I guess.
1293520	1299120	RA didn't ask about this writing. He wondered if it was even real due to no noticeable projection
1299120	1303600	mechanisms on the device and thought if the characters were actually being displayed into his
1303600	1313200	mind. But during our conversations together, I did run many of the famous symbols and iconography
1313200	1319440	from ufology by RA, such as the famous Roswell I beam, allegedly found amongst the Roswell wreckage
1319440	1325440	depicting NHI symbolism or language. It wasn't until I got to a relatively obscure reference that
1325440	1331520	RA identified iconography similar to what he saw. In 2021, Luella Zando's attorney,
1331520	1337760	Daniel Sheehan, made some startling remarks at UFO mega con. Sheehan claimed in 1977,
1337760	1342640	under orders from President Jimmy Carter, who did have a verifiable interest in UAP,
1342640	1347920	to scour classified portions of Project Blue Book. Now, we've talked extensively about
1347920	1352480	classified programs parallel to Blue Book, so I will skip that for now, but immediately the
1352480	1358240	testimony of Steven Lovekin comes to mind. Amongst the boxes of materials, Sheehan claimed to have
1358240	1364800	come across a series of five or six photographs depicting a downed saucer-shaped UAP, quote,
1364800	1370080	there were maybe five or six in this series of photographs and it hit in this field that had
1370080	1374960	snow on it and it plowed through this big ditch and you could see across this field and it was
1375040	1380320	stuck in the side of this embankment, end quote. Something about these images really stuck out
1380320	1386240	to Sheehan, quote, here's the semicircle of the craft, like this and the edges here, and they were
1386240	1391120	a series of these straight lines with dashes and dots and little horseshoe shapes like this, and
1391120	1396400	they went all the way around the bottom. But that's exactly what they looked like. And it didn't look
1396400	1400800	like the ones at Roswell. These are different. Now, I don't remember in which order they were
1400800	1405920	or the exact sequence, but that's exactly what the shapes were and it was all around,
1405920	1410640	right around the base of the dome of the saucer. I could tell they were Air Force guys because it
1410640	1415680	was snowing and they had these big furry hoods on with their jackets and stuff. And you could tell
1415680	1420320	that they were really excited. You could tell from looking at them as they were photographing this
1420320	1425600	thing, end quote. RA states the symbols Sheehan drew look quite close to the symbols projected
1425600	1432240	from this anomalous technology. And guys, real fast, we do know Blue Book ran from 52 to 69.
1432240	1436960	And since these images are from a classified section of Blue Book, can we factor in the
1436960	1442080	USAF soldiers and snow to try and determine a recovery event? Of course, this isn't the topic
1442080	1448240	of today's video. But let's just take a quick peek. One such possibility is the 1952 Spitzberg
1448240	1453120	in Norway event I will cover in the future. Interesting story here that has some confusing
1453200	1458240	pathways and possible misinformation. Most of what we know here is that the CIA took an
1458240	1464720	interest in reports of a crashed 47 meter disk. Besides this Norway case, not many fit our conditions,
1464720	1468800	so possibly this was actually a retrieval operation that was kept under wraps.
1473280	1478480	After a short time, the two green berets were escorted out of the offworld technologies division.
1479440	1482720	We were escorted out the same way we were escorted in. We went back to the training
1482720	1489840	room until we had been working in and we had a brief, like debrief, like a quick debrief with
1489840	1494640	the guy. I think I remember, I don't remember if that's when we signed some stuff or not. Did you
1494640	1498240	sign anything? And I was like, I don't remember particularly, but afterwards I thought about
1498240	1503520	it as like, I do think we were signing something. But that's not, we do that all the time with
1503520	1509280	everything. It's always just handpaper to you to sign in the military. So it would be hard to
1509280	1514560	pinpoint like, yeah, at this moment we signed an NDA. I probably signed 10 NDAs then didn't know.
1514560	1521920	We were escorted out. We talked about it briefly and then me and the guy had walked back to the
1521920	1526240	parking area together. We were going back to the same hotel. We were talking about it. We were
1526240	1531360	actually staying in the same hotel. So we got back, we talked about it a little and we were
1531680	1536960	both freaked out by the whole thing. Getting back to their hotel, R.A. and his fellow soldier
1536960	1542720	experienced some real ontological shock. R.A. and I are trying to get in contact with the other
1542720	1547840	soldier. After this event, the two lost contact due to not being stationed together. And R.A. even
1547840	1552640	heard rumors the other soldier was killed during a combat operation. We were both in that same,
1552640	1557440	like he was like, what the fuck? You know, that's, that's where we were. I mean, we go back,
1557440	1562560	got back to the hotel and was like, what the fuck? Like, what was that? He's like, so this is all
1562560	1566960	real? Like, we're, we're going through that whole thing, you know? Well, I haven't seen him in years.
1567760	1574080	I try to track him down to talk to him about this. And I wasn't able to find him or get a hold of him
1574080	1578960	or how does that picture? We weren't, we weren't stationed together. We didn't serve together.
1578960	1586080	We were in two far apart units. And, you know, we never was able to find him. And somebody told
1586080	1590800	me he passed and on a mission and that he was going, I don't know. So I don't, I don't know
1591680	1596400	any other way. But I mean, I never spoke to him after that our time together there.
1597040	1602160	After his experience, R.A. did not contact Arrow nor did he contact David Grush,
1602160	1607520	Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, or any of these notable figures. R.A. did not want his name
1607520	1613680	known publicly. To this day, R.A. performs op for opposing force training exercises for special
1613680	1620720	forces units at Area 51. The stuff I do with DOE, Department of Energy, Area 51, they control that
1620720	1626320	land. They hold all the contracts up there. And I'm here and I have a TSSI that was active for
1626320	1632240	12 years. So they'll pull me in and help you train projects. During his training operations,
1632240	1637200	R.A. has been exposed to all types of advanced drone technology, including sphere drones. He says
1637200	1642320	have often been mistaken for UAP and drones disguised as local fauna during the invasion of
1642320	1648480	Syria. He estimates many modern UAP sightings, not all, but especially orbs are in fact highly
1648480	1654400	advanced military drones. I've been exposed to drone technology. I still work, I do work out
1654400	1660480	at various, it's more indicationally still. So like some of the orb technology and so I've seen it.
1662080	1666560	It's not that cool to me anymore. I don't really care. A lot of the stuff that people are seeing
1666560	1673120	is our shit. So but and this really piques my interest. R.A. has also heard of human made
1673120	1678320	triangular craft that operate off of a electro gravitic propulsion. For anyone who wants to
1678320	1682400	learn more about electro gravitics, I highly recommend checking out my friend Jesse Michaels
1682400	1687600	video, the scientist who built UFOs for the CIA starting at about 17 minutes and five seconds.
1687600	1692560	Due to a trusted military contact, citing of a triangular shaped craft, R.A. estimates there
1692560	1698320	are human made triangle shaped craft and NHI based triangle shaped craft. Is this a possible
1698320	1704320	reference to the reverse engineered TR-3B? No, I don't think it was either. I think it was completely
1704320	1710880	foreign, alien, whatever. By the way he described it, the time frame he's talking about, just the
1710880	1716800	way he described it is there's some differences because I asked specific questions that I knew
1716800	1726160	to ask and it wasn't the same. For example, the lighting underneath our craft is incandescent
1726160	1731120	or it might be something more advanced, but it's almost like an incandescent light. So it's turned
1731120	1738640	on and off with a switch, you know. The lighting that he described was like always on and responded
1738640	1743760	to the ship. So I guess the ship would do stuff. You said the lights would brighten the dim. Like
1743760	1749680	he said windows are wasn't even one solid and he drew all this stuff down. He just said it was
1750480	1755120	seven or eight, maybe nine lights that went along the perimeter of the triangle
1756000	1763280	and which are our craftfulness three than I thought, you know. And so this he said had multiple
1763280	1767840	and the size was also the big one. He said it was like the size of three football fields.
1768160	1773360	They're not years at times. And that's just his guess. And it was simply the sound like ours
1773360	1778640	give off a fucking weird sound through these drones, human made triangles and other human
1778640	1784400	made technology are a has seen some truly impressive military tech. But in his own words,
1784400	1789360	all of this pales in comparison to what he observed at the offworld technology division.
1790240	1799280	So RA, a green beret and 18 bravo weapons specialist was sent for weapons training to the
1799280	1804560	naval surface weapons center in Crane, Indiana, whose mission is to provide the American war
1804560	1809280	fighter with the solutions to their toughest technical challenges to better equip a decisive
1809280	1815920	advantage in electromagnetic warfare, strategic missions and expeditionary warfare. Here he
1815920	1820400	learned about domestic and advanced weapon technologies and their implementation into the
1820400	1826480	modern battlefield. Due to his TS SCI clearance, RA was taken with a fellow green beret to Crane's
1826480	1832880	underground section to view more classified tech. His guide, a skinny private contractor employee
1832880	1838640	took the men to a secluded section of crane titled the offworld technologies division. Here,
1838640	1845200	RA was shown tech made by non human intelligence. Technology cranes best and brightest had no idea
1845200	1851760	how to operate. Technology possibly considered to be weaponry. Tech RA was told interacted with a
1851760	1859760	conscious being. NSWC crane employs a whopping 2489 contracting force and does business with
1859760	1865520	numerous defense companies. But one company stands out from the rest due to their historical
1865520	1872400	implication with UAP programs, research into human consciousness and massive contracts with Crane,
1872480	1879360	science applications, international corporation SAIC was started in 1969 and has historically
1879360	1886160	specialized in information technology, engineering and defense, enjoying numerous massive contracts
1886160	1892000	with the Department of Defense. But before we get started a few things, one I need to mention my
1892000	1897760	good friend Kermit for helping me out with the SAIC research. He specializes in researching
1897760	1903920	specifically SAIC so the man is a genius, you can find him on Reddit as frog in badger,
1903920	1909280	his link to his profile will be in the video description. Two, I need to mention the testimony
1909280	1915760	of former SAIC employee Denise McKenzie, who appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure
1915760	1921440	briefing document. McKenzie stated that in the hundreds of millions of dollars awarded to SAIC
1921440	1928080	for government contracts, most contracts had almost zero associated activity. She surmised that
1928080	1933600	black budget money is hidden within legitimate programs and contacts. After discussing these
1933600	1938480	discrepancies and contracts, McKenzie faced harassment within the company. The key to
1938480	1944800	beginning this investigation is analyzing the massive contracts SAIC has enjoyed with NSWC
1944800	1953040	Crane for myriad purposes, such as this 2024 $63 million contract to support NSWC Crane's
1953040	1958720	hypersonic advanced concepts. Weird how this article must be accessed on the web archive,
1958720	1965920	SAIC's internal site pulled this link down around June of 2024. Or how about this 2023
1965920	1974160	$240 million IDIQ, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity SAIC contract to support Crane's
1974160	1979760	Weapon Division instrumentation platform. Weird how this link also disappeared around January
1979760	1988000	of 2024. Another article pulled off of SAIC's site is this 2020 $133 million contract providing
1988000	1992880	mission engineering and integration support for maneuver, engagement, and surveillance
1992880	1997840	section of Crane. And these are just a few contracts, there are many more of interest,
1997920	2005280	such as this 2010 $351 million contract for SAIC to provide technical engineering
2005280	2011440	services to NSWC Crane. This specific contract aimed to support the Joint Special Operations
2011440	2017600	Response Department, JSOC. If you've never heard of JSOC well, this is the department
2017600	2022720	named alongside the CIA's Office of Global Access tasked with UAP crash retrieval and
2022720	2028560	collections. Another video for another day, guys. SAIC's connections to Crane are so massive,
2028560	2034400	we can find myriad modern day job opportunities as a contractor there. And what you may not know
2034400	2040480	is the intimate relationship between SAIC and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of Aero. The good
2040480	2046240	doctor has actually published patents under the company. SAIC has even participated in weapons
2046240	2051760	testing at Crane, quote, our team is right in the midst of that, providing expertise and quote,
2051760	2057280	said Diane Wilson, who manages support for the Small Arms contract. She heads a highly skilled
2057280	2062480	passionate team that she describes as, quote, totally focused on bringing the best technology
2062480	2067840	and the best weapons into the hands of the warfighter, end quote. Sounds very similar to the
2067840	2072800	claims of RA's contractor who was instructing the Green Berets on weapons testing, does it not?
2072800	2078800	So what about SAIC's connection to UAP, reverse engineering, and key here, consciousness related
2078800	2084800	technology? Well, to start, SAIC is eligible under the DoD's corporate portfolio program.
2084800	2090320	Remember how David Grush had private contractors work hand in hand with DoD elements on UAP
2090320	2095200	programs nestled within special access programs? Well, the corporate portfolio program gives
2095200	2102400	defense industrial based corporations like SAIC access to DoD executives, scientists, and management
2102400	2109200	with broad access to special access program portfolios. If this NHI weapons testing program
2109200	2114880	is being siloed to the Navy at Crane and SAIC, this is likely a set of contracts that falls
2114880	2119680	under systems engineering and technical assessment slash research and development,
2119680	2124080	with money split between acknowledged and unacknowledged special access programs.
2124080	2128160	And with the slightest bit of research, we can see that the corporate portfolio program was
2128160	2133600	established in 2020 by former Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen
2133600	2140560	Lorde. After leaving the Pentagon in 2021, she joined SAIC as a strategic advisor.
2140560	2146080	And this brings me back to that 2020 $133 million contract providing mission engineering and
2146080	2151440	integration services for the maneuver, engagement, and surveillance division of Crane. We observe this
2151440	2157280	contract with Crane is an R&D project and falls under special warfare and expeditionary systems.
2157920	2163120	One subset of the contract is the Special Capabilities Branch of Crane. Does this specific
2163120	2167280	contract highlight money going towards the Off-World Technology division? And the connection
2167280	2173440	here gets even more exact and more strange. To mention briefly, SAIC even published a paper
2173440	2179840	around 1990 titled Electric Propulsion Study. This study, referenced by Jesse Michaels relating to
2179840	2185760	T. Townsend Brown in UAP Propulsion, discusses electrogravity. A propulsion mechanism mentioned
2185760	2192160	by RA and often associated with human attempts at NHI craft, such as the Fluxliner Allege Reverse
2192160	2198080	Engineered Craft, or ARV, mentioned by aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish, which operated off
2198080	2204000	of electrogravity propulsion. But does anybody remember the CIA Stargate program in the 1970s
2204000	2209440	and 1980s? The program aimed to study the potential of remote viewing and psychic phenomena for
2209520	2215840	military applications. This program spearheaded by defense contractor SRI International was
2215840	2222160	terminated in 1995 due to the program claiming it had no useful results. There was a corporation
2222160	2227040	doing parallel research into such mental phenomena and consciousness research around this time,
2227040	2235200	and yes, you guessed it, SAIC. SAIC also continued to study these subjects post-1995 when the programs
2235200	2239440	moved out of the military. Diving into this territory is somewhat uncomfortable for me,
2239440	2243440	but let's remember David Grush discussing the Stargate program on JRE.
2244240	2249840	We seem to just possess other skills. I mean, it goes back to like the Stargate program, right,
2249840	2256000	you know, with Declassified by Clinton and sensibly canceled, I guess, in 1996, you know,
2256000	2261280	where you had people trained in remote viewing and like there was feedback loops to confirm what
2261280	2266800	they saw was real and either satellite imagery or human sources where they sketched out a room
2266800	2271120	of where there's hostages and they got a hostage out and they're like, and this is a real story,
2271120	2276800	actually. And Ross Colthart in his Reddit Ask Me Anything stating one word we should be paying
2276800	2282560	attention to is psionic. And of course, the dictionary definition for psionic is the practical
2282560	2288240	use of psychic powers or paranormal phenomena. Right off the bat, there are three extremely
2288240	2294560	impactful SAIC studies I want to mention, protocols for the use of human subjects from SAIC's
2294560	2300160	cognitive science laboratory, and a comprehensive research plan for anomalous mental phenomena
2300160	2307360	from SAIC to the Defense Intelligence Agency, both written in 1991. We also have a 1995 paper titled
2307360	2313280	Evaluation of a Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena, which states SAIC evaluated the
2313280	2319040	research of SRI International and the Stargate program to continue research internally. Here
2319040	2325280	we see another paper titled An Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic Funding. We can see SAIC
2325280	2331840	even coined their own terms for psionics. Anomalous cognition describing extrasensory perception,
2331840	2338960	aka a sixth sense. An anomalous perturbation describing psychokinesis. While these terms
2338960	2345280	may seem extraordinary, we can find a now-deleted 2012 Office of Naval Research paper on a human
2345280	2352480	sixth sense, aka extrasensory perception. So while this territory of psionics and researching human
2352480	2357920	cognition is uncomfortable territory for me, according to RA, the Naval Surface Weapon Center
2357920	2363440	holds off-world technology handled by private contractors, and the technology somehow interacts
2363440	2370160	with conscious beings. While SAIC and the Navy have approvable interest in this field of psionics
2370160	2375680	and human cognition potential. And guys, this is all just mention of SAIC's connection to
2375680	2381920	crane and anomalous human cognition research. There is so much more to discuss with UAP and SAIC,
2381920	2386560	it probably warrants its own video. Like how Commander Will Miller, one of the key players in
2386560	2391600	the Wilson Davis memo, labeled SAIC as one of the prominent contractors who are quote-unquote
2391600	2398560	keepers of the secrets in regards to UAP programs. Or the Stephen Greer 1996 briefing to Congress,
2398560	2405040	which labeled SAIC as a quote-unquote crown jewel relating to UAP projects and facilities.
2405040	2410240	Or lastly, SAIC's inclusion in Catherine Austin Fitz's paper stating quote,
2410240	2414720	large proportion of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret
2414720	2419920	unaccountable channels, end quote. To support Black budget military research and development,
2419920	2425120	I spoke about this paper in the Wilson Davis video, but SAIC and Lockheed were two of the
2425120	2431280	IBM contractors labeled as responsible for obfuscating data on siphoned DoD funds,
2431280	2434640	leading to a failed DoD general accounting office audit.
2439200	2445120	A simple Google Duck Duck Go or any browser of your choosing search will yield zero results for
2445120	2450160	the off-world technologies division. I have personally scoured thousands of documents trying
2450160	2455920	to find any mention of this program named by RA to be nestled within Crane. And well guys,
2455920	2461920	we do have one lead worth chasing. In his book Magic Eyes Only, which is one of the greatest
2461920	2467280	books ever written on crash retrievals, author Ryan S. Wood discusses the legitimacy of the
2467280	2475200	MJ-12SOM-01 or Special Operations Manual. This leak document covers from A to Z, quote,
2475200	2481520	extraterrestrial entities and technology recovery and disposal, end quote. For contextual relevance,
2481520	2487200	Wood mentions a document that appeared in the MJ-12 leaks, allegedly sent by President Franklin
2487200	2494080	D. Roosevelt. This memorandum titled The Special Committee on Non-Terrestrial Science and Technology
2494080	2499760	discusses the application of quote unquote, non-terrestrial technology and the continuation
2499760	2505360	of the quote already hardened research for advanced weapons program, end quote. This title
2505360	2510640	and effort sounds extremely similar to the off-world technologies division description,
2510640	2517200	but the connection here goes deeper. In this memo, Dr. Vannevar Bush is named. If you haven't,
2517200	2522720	I highly recommend checking out my video on Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the U.S. UFO
2522720	2528160	crash retrieval and technology exploitation programs. Physicist and member of the Scientific
2528160	2533520	Research and Development Board, Robert Sarbacher, was outspoken regarding the involvement of Dr.
2533520	2539280	Vannevar Bush and covert UFO programs. During an interview with legendary UFO researcher,
2539280	2546240	Stanton Friedman, Sarbacher name dropped one Dr. Eric A. Walker as a crash retrieval member.
2546240	2552000	Viewers of this video will remember a series of interviews with Dr. Eric A. Walker. Walker dodged
2552000	2557120	many questions when asked about things like the MJ-12. He outright confirmed he was present
2557120	2564000	to the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash, and he also said a few sentences that are often overlooked
2564000	2568800	but incredibly strange in the context of the off-world technologies division and consciousness
2568800	2575440	related technology. This technology RA observed required a conscious observer to perform, activate,
2575440	2581680	or whatever it does. When asked about people within the UFO issue, Dr. Walker discusses how
2581760	2588160	few people are capable of handling this issue. He states, quote, how good is your sixth sense?
2588720	2594320	How much do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it and how to use it, you would not be
2594320	2606000	taken in. Only a few know about it, end quote. Another DOD slash DOE contractor involved with
2606000	2613120	NSWC Crane I want to briefly explore here is Sandia National Labs. If you remember from my 1950s
2613120	2619360	Dell Rio crash retrieval video, UAP crash material were allegedly stored in the Atomic Energy Commission
2619360	2626080	Sandia Labs facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. In that video, I drew the connection to AT&T,
2626080	2632400	manager of Sandia at the time, being implicated in UAP technology transfer. SAIC has massive
2632480	2639440	contracts itself with Sandia National Labs, such as this 2013 five-year 228 million dollar
2639440	2646800	IT consolidation contract. But what really interests me here is this 2023 technology transfer between
2646800	2653680	NSWC Crane, Sandia Labs, and other participants for advanced hypersonic technology. Of course,
2653680	2659200	hypersonics have existed since the 1970s with Soviet vehicles, and there are sources connected
2659280	2664560	to the IC that tell me Sandia's stealth plasma physics regarding hypersonic craft is of real
2664560	2669760	interest here. However, I do think this is worth mentioning because of some interesting context.
2669760	2675600	In 2023, attorney Daniel Sheehan implicated the defense contractor Radiance Technologies being
2675600	2681520	involved with UAP reverse engineering. Sheehan claimed Radiance's prompt global strike program
2681520	2686480	leveraged reverse engineered UAP technologies for their hypersonic missile development program.
2687040	2691120	Probably not much of a connection here, but after Sheehan's claims, it is interesting to see
2691120	2698080	both SAIC and Sandia National Labs connected to each other and NSWC with the hypersonics program.
2702320	2708720	The connection between the U.S. Navy, SAIC, and UAP programs go even deeper. Meet NASA
2708720	2713840	mission specialist Bob Ulsler, a now deceased engineer who explored robotic sciences and
2713840	2720160	created remote controlled machines for the U.S. space agency. Ulsler had a keen interest in UFOs.
2720160	2725680	In 1989, Ulsler met with Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, whose incredible credentials include
2725680	2731600	former NSA director and director of naval intelligence. Inman told Ulsler about quote
2731600	2739440	unquote recovered vehicles available for research. Do you anticipate that any of the
2740080	2748480	recovered vehicles would ever become available for technological research outside of the
2748480	2754400	military circles? Again, I honestly don't know. Ten years ago, the answer would have been no.
2755360	2760640	Whether a time has evolved or they're beginning to become open on it is a possibility.
2760640	2766080	Inman even referred Ulsler to speak with Everett Heineman of the CIA, DS&T, and former director
2766080	2773200	of naval intelligence Sumner Shapiro for more information on UAP recoveries. In 1992, Inman
2773200	2780320	would leave the federal service and join the board of SAIC. According to Ulsler, an alien contact
2780320	2785600	by Timothy Good, Ulsler met retired rear Admiral Shapiro under the guys he was interested in working
2785600	2791360	within the group that manages UAP information. Shapiro stated to Ulsler that the U.S. possesses
2791360	2797040	extra terrestrial vehicles and that Shapiro had even studied one up close. According to Shapiro,
2797040	2802400	teams would disassemble the craft, pack up the parts and ship them to labs across the continental
2802400	2808480	United States. Did NSWC Crane receive some sort of craft component? Navy suits thought to be
2808480	2814160	utilized as a weapon system? If you want to learn more about Ulsler, see the video description for
2814160	2819360	a series of interviews. I may cover him further in the future as Ulsler has much more to say
2819360	2825040	about UAP, including the possibility the Navy utilizes EMP weaponry to interfere with craft
2825040	2830240	flight systems. So perhaps there's some really interesting further research to be done on the U.S.
2830240	2835120	Navy in particular, testing and receiving parts of downed or crashed UAP.
2839840	2846800	And to touch on briefly, back in 2017 at Navy Air Station Pax River, American aerospace engineer
2846800	2852560	and inventor with a PhD in mechanical and aerospace engineering, Salvador Pais,
2852560	2858320	filed a patent for a triangle slash diamond shaped craft that exhibits anti-gravitic effects and
2858320	2864880	strongly resembles a TR-3B, a ledge reverse engineered triangle craft. The patent was supported
2864880	2871920	by Naval Air Enterprise CTO, James Sheehy, and then approved. This craft design described by Pais is
2871920	2877600	able to create and manipulate fields and quantum vacuum around the craft, leading to craft propulsion.
2877600	2882400	I'd leave this to smarter physics people than I, but I would really recommend watching Salvatore
2882400	2887920	Pais's episode on Kurt Gimungals, The Theory of Everything. And in his book, In Plain Sight,
2887920	2892880	Ross Colthart relays a conversation with former U.S. Navy director of science and technology
2892880	2898800	development, Nat Corbett's. Corbett state he made a few quote unquote discrete inquiries
2898800	2904000	into Pais's craft patent and Nav Air Pax River. None of his Navy colleagues had any
2904000	2909360	information on Pais or his patents. Corbett stated quote, if there is anything near a
2909360	2915600	working anti-gravity craft, they've kept it very quiet end quote. Pax River is a very important
2915600	2921280	message here. Located in Virginia, Nav Air Pax River is almost a counterpart to Nav Sea Crane.
2921280	2928000	Pax River also has a storied history of contracts with SAIC. Pais, his patents exotic propulsion,
2928000	2934480	Nav Air and Pax River were worth briefly mentioning to me just due to the strangeness of NSWC Crane's
2934480	2940560	Nav Sea's sister facility Pax River. Perhaps similar programs of NHI technology reverse
2940560	2947120	engineering efforts are conducted at this facility as well. What's up guys it's Gerb,
2947120	2953280	I hope you enjoyed this look into RA and the off-world technologies division nestled within
2953280	2960480	NSWC Crane, Indiana. This project has been exceptional for me to work on. I've got to talk
2960480	2967360	to some incredible people like RA. I need to shout out again Kermit for all the SAIC research
2968400	2972960	and just the amount of research that stemmed from this small testimony. I mean let's think
2972960	2980160	about this. RA stated that he was at an SWC. He was taken deep underground by a contractor.
2980160	2986240	I'm willing to bet my best bucket it's an SAIC person shown an off-world technologies
2986240	2992080	division with two pieces of technology on display that interact with human consciousness.
2992960	2998560	This begs the question are these the only two pieces of technology that this off-world technology
2998560	3005200	has or are there multiple and these really are what kind of RA was thinking about just put on
3005200	3012480	display. Right now I'm working with RA to actually get some drawings and possible 3D models of what
3012480	3017360	he saw. I think that would really help everybody kind of visualize what he's seen and so forth.
3017360	3023600	I was stunned at the amount of available research just from hearing about these two objects especially
3023600	3030720	the symbology that RA saw and how it connected to she hand symbols. When he stated in 2021 he saw
3030720	3038640	these on an image of a downed craft. Just truly truly fantastic stuff. I forgot to mention in the
3038640	3046560	video just because there's so much I couldn't fit everything in. In I think late July of 2023
3047120	3054560	RA contacted Stephen Greer and the disclosure project to tell this story. He emailed them about
3054560	3061040	his story and they never got back to him. So that was weird but if you want to read about his
3061040	3066400	files in there I think he's witness number 10127. But I really hope you guys enjoyed this. Let me
3066400	3074640	know what you think with the off-world technologies division and its connections to you know possibly
3074640	3082080	that FDR MJ12 memo from 44. There is an offshoot of parallel research here and this is just incredible
3082080	3088560	that this ties into the MJ12 and everything too. So I really hope you guys enjoyed this video. I'm
3088560	3093760	sorry it took me so long. This has just been a lot of investigation a lot of research as we can see
3093760	3098960	that this off-world technologies division has research from everywhere from NSWC Crane in their
3098960	3106320	contracts with SAIC all the way to Salvatore, Pais and Pax River. So if you guys wouldn't mind
3107040	3112160	drop a like, drop a subscription and share this video around if you can. You know I can't get the
3112160	3117760	same sort of video output as some of the other creators in this space. I got a lot more research
3117760	3121280	and stuff to put into my video. So if you could share it around I'd appreciate it and let me know
3121280	3126800	below what you guys think of RA and his story. Let me know if you have come across any other stories
3126800	3131120	that may fit into this investigation. Help me investigate further. If you know or if you've
3131120	3136720	heard of the off-world technologies division please tell me because I would love to have any sort of
3136720	3142000	documents or research I can. There is one really interesting tie-in I've been thinking of lately.
3142000	3148800	Does anybody remember when Jason Sands came public on Twitter? You remember the whistleblower that
3148800	3153440	came before him his name was Steve who actually introduced Sands didn't say him by name but kind
3153440	3156800	of set his story and this is what had Sands come forward on Twitter. Well do you remember the other
3156800	3161360	guy who came forward I think on Courtney I can't remember her last name's page his name was Martin
3161360	3168080	he claimed to be in like a kind of remote viewing programs growing up. Well I listened to his testimony
3168640	3175040	and one of his claims was that when he was a part of these programs there was a time where I think
3175040	3182160	there was eight scientists brought a briefcase into a room and opened it and in this briefcase
3182160	3189200	was a sphere the size of a basketball very clear looking that Martin was told chose who it interacted
3189200	3196240	with I think he said so I've actually connected with Martin I'm talking to him now I'm really keen
3196240	3201280	to get to the bottom of his story too and see if there's any sort of connections I can make there
3201280	3205680	because this is just really perplexing as I said in the video just kind of the stuff with
3205680	3210480	consciousness SAI's research into remote viewing and stuff this is really weird territory for me
3210480	3215680	I'm a real nuts and bolts type guy when it comes to UAP I like the fact so whenever there's any
3215680	3220320	sort of distortion of human cognition like in the whistleblower like in the infographics whistleblower
3220320	3227360	video or technology that interacts with human consciousness or like p3 assets like Mike Herrera
3227360	3232720	talks about it's all very new territory for me so you know it's strange expeditions for me I'm sure
3232720	3239520	it is for you too sometimes just because growing up I am just the UFO guy I like the craft I like
3239520	3243520	the crash retrieval I like the reverse engineering but the more you study this phenomenon I think
3243520	3249360	the guys on mysterious universe said it the stranger it gets a lot of a lot of high strangeness
3249360	3254480	and weirdness gets here so again guys remember to leave a like and thank you so much I will
3254480	3255600	catch you all in the next show
