0	6560	In March of 2024, the Infographics show, a popular and excellent channel with custom animations
6560	13200	and fantastic storytelling posted a video titled, US Special Forces Confession, I Recovered Crash
13200	19920	UFOs. Although the channel has covered the UAP subject in the past, this entry stood out entirely.
20480	25840	The video covers the testimony of an individual who encountered a crashed UAP while serving in
25840	32480	Vietnam. With engaging storytelling and mesmerizing animations, the Infographics team highlights how
32480	39120	this sighting saw the soldier read into covert UAP operations and details his work on the program.
39680	44560	Astonishing details of UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering are highlighted in this
44560	49520	account very similar to the claims of David Grush. I'm sure many people saw this video,
49520	55440	enjoyed it, and moved on. Just as many watched it and thought, huh, I wonder if this is real.
55440	60480	But the narrator starts this video with a statement that almost forces us to analyze the
60480	66720	entire video line by line. Note, the following is based on testimony provided over a series of
66720	72160	interviews and written correspondence, edited and cut together in an attempt to create a cohesive
72160	78000	timeline of the events as described. Do these events recount the experience of a real anonymous
78000	84240	whistleblower? Is this story rooted in fact, and are there elements we can verify? And why did he
84240	90240	speak to the Infographics show? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you for joining me as we conduct
90240	96480	a full breakdown and analysis of the Infographics show's US Special Forces Confession, I Recovered
96480	102640	UFOs. Since its release, I have played this testimony over and over and over in my head.
102640	107760	Is it possible that these events and details recount the true testimony of someone on a UFO
107760	113360	crash retrieval program? I think it is well worth investigating their story. Searching for holes or
113440	119600	confirmable elements, because this could very well be the most crucial first-hand whistleblower of all time.
125040	129920	To start, our witness states, and I will be calling him our witness for the duration of this video,
129920	136480	that our story begins in 1968, during the Vietnam conflict along the Vietnam-Kimbodia border.
136480	142480	Before we get into his story, we do have two interesting Vietnam cases that may be contextually
142480	147360	relevant to our Infographics whistleblower. We can check in on the ever-relevant Stephen
147360	152560	Greer redacted witness log to analyze the statements and emails of witness 10622.
153120	160880	10622 served as CTR Communication Technician Radio in the US Navy from 1966 to 1970,
160880	166880	on the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier. It was in June of 1968 on official duties,
166960	172880	he received scrambled messages mentioning at least 11 UAP were tracked on visual and radar.
173680	179680	And on September 9, 1968, several US helicopter pilots and soldiers stationed at a Marine Corps
179680	185600	base in Dong Ha, Vietnam had a close encounter with a fast-moving object. This object had green
185600	191760	and white lights and engaged in maneuvers for 20 minutes. Anyways, our witness states his US military
191760	197440	unit was performing an LRRP, a long-range reconnaissance patrol tracking supply routes into
197440	203760	South Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as marking out sites for a B-52 bombing raid the following year.
203760	209120	This tiny snippet in the video gives us so much to unpack. The following year of 1969,
209120	215760	a covert bombing raid did in fact occur. On March 18, 1969, the Strategic Air Command commenced
215760	222400	Operation Menu, not declassified until 2000 by President Bill Clinton. Operation Menu was a year
222400	229680	long B-52 bombing campaign that ravaged Eastern Cambodia, and that mention LRRP may be one of
229680	235120	the most significant pieces to solving this puzzle. Long-range reconnaissance patrol was a special
235120	241200	unit acting in Vietnam, Company E 52nd Infantry, attached to the 1st Calvary Division in the
241200	249200	US Army. This unit operated in Vietnam from 1967 to 1969, well within the time frame of our witness
249200	255840	and participated in two of the largest battles of Vietnam, the Tet Offensive and Siege of Que Son.
256400	263280	In late October of 1968, Company E 52nd Infantry was relocated and headquartered at Phuoc Vinh,
263280	269680	north of Vietnam. The division's area of operations was designated along the Cambodian border in
269680	276080	Tainin, Bin Long, and Phuoc Long provinces, all in South Vietnam. These areas contained
276080	282240	significant routes for enemy infiltration into the Saigon area from Cambodia. So if our witness
282240	288080	is telling the truth and this crash is real, this event occurred in October to December 1968 within
288080	295840	the Company E 52nd Infantry, LRRP, stationed out of Phuoc Vinh. So far, his testimony lines up exactly
295920	302000	with real events. And finally back to our story, a quote unquote object appeared overhead the witness
302000	308480	in his platoon, emitting a bright red orange glow appearing to be melting. The object quickly moved
308480	314240	out of sight, but only five or six seconds later, a large crash followed by a dull thump
314240	319600	reverberated throughout the jungle. The platoon figured this must have been a US plane, so knowing
319600	324800	better than to risk long range radio communications being intercepted by Soviet agents, they moved
324800	330320	to secure the crash site. Arriving at the site, the platoon knew immediately this was not a US
330320	336080	plane classified or acknowledged. The only prosaic explanation the soldiers could think of was a crash
336080	342880	base probe, something from NASA or the Soviets. The craft was egg shaped, dull gray and metallic,
342880	347680	and seemingly cracked open. Again we see the description this craft appeared to be made
347680	354560	from a single piece of metal with no bolts, seams, or screws. This sighting and craft description
354560	360240	give us a lot to work off of actually. What immediately stands out to me is this red orange
360240	365120	glow the craft emanated while flying over the jungle. There are two cases within our crashes
365120	370160	timeframe that are worth mentioning that are similar to this. We can look to November 22nd
370160	379360	of 1968 to NICAP case 681122. On this date in Albany, Georgia, a glowing yellow white oval UFO
379360	385360	was seen from a car, directed a light beam at the vehicle and flew away changing colors to red and
385360	393040	orange. And let's head to move France on December 15th 1968. Reported in a book translated as UFO,
393040	398240	the first complete file on close encounters in France. We can find a case where an egg shaped
398240	403680	object the size of a car moved quickly without making noise, emanating orange reflections.
404400	410560	But let's not forget an event that occurred just a year earlier on March 24th 1967 highlighted in
410560	416880	the sworn affidavits by Captain Robert Salas and others at Malmstrom Air Force Base. I covered this
416880	424160	case in my UFO and nukes video, but this event saw a red orange oval UAP appear over the base,
424160	431200	disabling the ICBMs of Malmstrom. And this mention of an egg shaped object comes up again and again
431760	436400	in ufology. We will talk about this more later in the video with the witnesses experience within
436400	441680	the program. But let's look at the testimony of aerospace contractor Eric Taper to Aero,
441680	447680	who recounted an egg shaped metallic UFO being kept at Area 51 in the 1980s. The description
447680	453280	of this craft is almost identical to the Vietnam encounter. And lastly, the molten feel of the
453280	458400	craft reminds me closely of the mother of pearl effect displayed on the skin of the craft Lance
458400	463360	Corporal Jonathan Waygant claimed to have observed in the jungles of Peru in 1997.
464000	468880	Our platoon of Marines called in the crash only to hear there were already birds in root and
468880	475120	ordered to secure the crash. Quickly, a pair of F4 jets fell into orbit overhead. The mention of
475120	481040	the McDonnell Douglas F4 Phantom II may seem small, but this is actually a huge detail in our
481040	487680	story. In June of 1986, former Betul Corps contractor James McCamble told ufology Jacques
487680	494000	Valais he met with a military contact with the wild weasels, a codename given by USAF for aircraft
494000	498800	equipped with anti radiation missiles and tasked with the suppression of enemy air defenses in
498800	505760	Vietnam. This contractor told McCamble F4 jets were equipped with EM detection equipment to detect
505760	511760	UAP during the war. Dr. Steven Greer may have an additional witness adding valuable context these
512000	519120	claims. Witness 10272 claims to have worked for a UK based contractor installing low observable
519120	525200	radar assemblies on F4 fighters at area 51. Along with these claims, the witness alleges to have
525200	531200	been involved in the evaluation of hardware from NHI craft. Anyways, infantry then touched down
531200	535920	and acted in perimeter security, but I want to note the witness states they were allowed nowhere
535920	541520	near the craft. They were deployed in a wide swath. It took two days for the craft to be removed from
541520	547200	the jungle, all with the help of SOF, Special Operations Forces, Navy and Air Force officials
547200	552400	on site who had already been read into the program. The mention of the Air Force is no surprise here.
553120	559120	Ever since the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash and the involvement of USAF General Roger Raimi,
559120	564160	the Air Force has long been entwined with the study of UAP. Again, I would like to recommend
564160	572400	my Moondust video and USAF Document AFC-1E draft policy, which states Project UFO and Moondust,
572400	576720	both headquartered out of the Air Force, have collection responsibilities for UAP
576720	581920	and descended foreign space vehicles. The Navy is a bit more interesting. Sure,
581920	587760	we have Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who speaks openly about UAP and OPNAV regulations to restrict
587760	593200	UAP reporting I covered in my USO videos, but I can't help thinking about the Wilson Davis memo.
593200	599040	After all, if this memo is true, which I fully believe it is, DIA Director and Vice Admiral
599040	609600	Thomas Wilson was Stonewalled from reading into the program. This was our witness's first ever
609600	615280	interaction with the program. Throughout Vietnam, several rapid reaction units were on standby
615280	620320	for retrieval purposes, and it's here the witness adds some interesting context.
620400	625120	That's what everyone called it, the program, and there were several rapid reaction units
625120	629920	stationed throughout in theater. See, we learned from the Korean War that these things are attracted
629920	634880	to conflict, and I guess that makes sense. It's probably one of the most interesting things we
634880	639520	do. A lot of people think this whole mess started in World War II, and maybe it did,
639520	643840	but the program got put together during the Korean War, and that's when it was official.
643840	650880	The Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953. While the first US-based retrieval of a UAP occurred in
650880	657440	Roswell in 1947, it is possible the program took a few years to put together. If we are going to
657440	662480	believe the MJ-12 documents, the program in charge of UAP investigation, crash retrieval,
662480	667520	and reverse engineering, operated under US President Truman and briefed President Eisenhower
667520	676240	who took office in 1953. This means the program was put together during 1945 more like 1947 to 1950,
676800	681840	fitting in nicely with the realm of the Korean War. We can of course guess the program was already
681840	687280	implemented by 1950 when senior radio engineer wrote to the Canadian Controller of Telecommunications
687280	692880	in the Department of Transport stating the US was actively engaged in studying UAP in an effort
692880	698320	so classified it rated even higher than the H-bomb. This information was provided to the
698320	704480	engineer Wilbert B. Smith by physicist and member of the US Research and Development Board and
704480	709360	student under Einstein, Robert Sarbacher. I highly recommend my video on this subject,
709360	715280	as it very well may cover the early days of the program. The witness also states,
715280	720320	these things are attracted to conflict. Well, we know from numerous stories including
720320	725760	Robert Salas and Mounds from Air Force Base, UAP have a direct interest in observing and interacting
725760	731440	with nuclear arms. We know from the testimony of Bob Jacobs, UAP have even an interest in dummy
731440	737440	flights of ICBMs. And if the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash is true, let's remember this happening
737440	743760	during Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which oversaw extensive nuclear testing. It certainly looks like
744400	751600	they want to understand how far we've advanced in our nuclear fizzle kind of technologies at the
751600	756400	very least. I mean, it looks like preparatory probing activity. It might be innocent kind
756400	762320	of scientific gathering. Could be ISR probing. Anyways, it was at this time the witness and
762320	767360	his fellow platoon mates were read into the program. Joining the program was by force.
767360	772640	The soldiers were faced with this or a general discharge. Likely drug charges are an Article
772640	778240	15, which gives military commanders an easy way to punish minor infractions breaching military
778240	784560	conduct. This draws my attention to an alleged crash retrieval that occurred on April 12, 1954,
784560	789920	related to Leonard Stringfield by a witness K.A. You can read about this in Stringfield's UFO
789920	794880	crash retrieval status report three, amassing the evidence. And the link, of course, will be in the
794880	800800	description. In this incident, K.A. and the USAF crew rescue four out of Roswell Air Force Base
800800	806560	were dispatched to a site 25 to 30 miles northwest where they observed a metallic saucer crashed
806560	811840	edgewise into the sand with a dome in its center. A ground crew and fatigues was already at this
811840	817600	site prevented the men from getting closer and began tagging debris and scattered NHI bodies.
817600	823280	K.A. returned to Roswell was debriefed for three days in a quote unquote living hell and told by
823280	828480	men identifying as intelligence officers in civilian clothes not to speak about the incident.
828480	834240	Reading to K.A. a law that referred to a fine imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge.
834800	839040	Our witness states his introduction to the program was highly compartmentalized.
839040	844240	He was only told what he needed to know. This mirrors accurately the compartmentalization
844240	849760	discussed in the Wilson Davis memo. The four programs that referred Admiral Wilson to the
849760	854880	program were quote part of it in different compartments placed in different layers of
854880	860560	the compartment's pyramid split up to do different things of parts of it. It is interesting to hear
860560	866960	our witness state I didn't even realize those damn things were from space until I actually saw a body.
866960	872080	So some of these craft are indeed from space and some are manned vessels. We know from my
872080	877840	fast walker video there is factual evidence USG elements had a term for objects entering or
877840	884000	leaving Earth's atmosphere denoted as fast walkers and defense support satellites were likely
884000	889680	used to monitor these objects. And the subject of bodies can be pretty contentious but like David
889680	894960	Gruss said well naturally when you recover something that's either landed or crashed
896400	902960	sometimes you encounter dead pilots and believe it or not as fan as fantastical as that sounds
904480	909200	it's true. The witness states the more he figured out the more he was read into the program.
909200	914320	He never learned all the truth but knew enough he felt compelled to come forward especially as an
914320	920080	aging gentleman. Serving in Vietnam I would put this individual's age at around 74 or older
920720	925520	and claiming he had been out of the program for 20 years means his service in the program
925520	932400	occurred from around 1969 to 2004. The witness even discusses David Grush commenting on his
932400	937440	approach to speaking publicly and labeling him a patriot. He even confirms the involvement of
937440	942880	aerospace contractors and sophisticated disinformation. I don't think we need to expand
942880	947200	on these topics too much in general as I have multiple videos exploring the full involvement
947200	952320	of Lockheed Martin and Battelle Memorial Institute's interaction with UAP and fully covered the
952320	957840	birth of the UAP stigma. Check out those videos for some valuable context here. After being read
957840	962960	into the program the witness's unit was put back on duty but broken up and placed in horrific
962960	969120	combat engagements. Five of the original 12 died in combat. I know five of the original 12
969120	974960	died in combat. Three more badly wounded. I think they were trying to kill us off. If this broken
974960	980960	up team still served with the first Calvary Division LRRP we may in fact be able to track these
980960	986800	names. Of the 1,000 men who served in this unit 45 were killed in Vietnam and Cambodia.
987440	992400	And the witness states a year after the initial crash he was officially brought into the program
992400	997680	where his primary job was no longer being a soldier but he was now part of the program.
997680	1002400	So with this information we can conclude that these soldiers were killed between October to
1002400	1009200	December of 1968 where the crash occurred and October to December of 1969 when he was brought
1009200	1014480	into the program and we'll give an error factor of around plus or minus let's say three months.
1014480	1020480	I have actually found a memorial site dedicated to those served and fell in the LRRP unit within
1020480	1026000	the first Calvary Division. Analyzing the casualty list we can try and trace the deaths of these brave
1026000	1031440	soldiers from the time of our crash October to December 68 and our witness being read into the
1031440	1038480	program October to December 1969. So we're left with 16 possible names. If we filter out soldiers
1038480	1044320	who died of non-hostile actions we are left with eight possible names. If our witness is telling the
1044320	1050240	truth five of eight of these names are likely platoon mates of his who observed the crashed
1050240	1056080	egg-shaped UAP. It didn't happen often but these things did fall out of the sky where people would
1056080	1061120	see something land or witness beings happening more often than people know and we'd swoop in as
1061120	1065440	fast as we could in case there was anything to snatch up. I think we pulled three total
1065440	1070960	craft out of theater and not just Vietnam. Damn near started a war with China in one recovery.
1070960	1076240	Up to three craft in Vietnam well perhaps there are others who can expand on this. Within
1076240	1082800	Stephen Greer's redacted witness list we return to again and again and again we find witness 10659
1082800	1088880	quote first hand involvement in Vietnam crash slash retrieval of ET craft involved directly
1088880	1096480	with ET technology POC to other military UFO events including dad's presence at 1954 Edwards
1097200	1102240	Air Force Base UFO landing. I do think this witness is separate from our infographics witness due to
1102240	1109040	the claims of dad's presence at a 1954 Edwards AFB landing. The witness comments how one retrieval
1109040	1114160	almost started a war with China the program only getting the upper hand due to China's primitive
1114160	1120640	early warning systems. David Grush has commented on this a multi-decade long cold war between the
1120640	1126480	U.S. China and other U.S. adversaries. We're in a competition with their adversaries to understand
1126480	1133760	this and it's a it's a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long and
1134320	1139440	you know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states
1139440	1146480	accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to the subject and I think
1146480	1154000	the up to secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where a country might make a
1154000	1161440	breakthrough let's say we that's an adversary of ours and it is so destabilizing. You say there's
1161440	1168240	been a cold war behind the scenes with Russia and China. There has been a cold war against our
1168240	1172880	with our with our peer adversaries yeah. The witness also states recoveries in the ocean would be
1172880	1179200	near impossible that Europe was another hotspot for UFO activity. This was due to curiosity
1179200	1184480	towards the always militarized European mainland especially within the Cold War and a few decades
1184480	1189600	removed from World War two. Europe was able to keep a tighter lid on the subject especially with
1189600	1194320	the European populace quote turning their nose up at the whole UFO thing end quote.
1194720	1204640	The crafts themselves were extraordinary that's the only way to describe them I wasn't there for
1204640	1208960	every single recovery obviously but they kept collections of them in different places and
1208960	1214560	I got to see two of the collections. The question of craft housing and material handling is done
1214560	1219920	is always fascinating starting with a quote unquote collection of craft as we know from
1219920	1226160	David Grush the USG is in possession of up to 12 to 15 craft. When you say crash retrieval what
1226160	1232720	do you mean? These are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles you know call it
1232720	1238880	spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed.
1238880	1247200	We have spacecraft from another species. We do yeah. How many? Quite a number. You're kidding.
1247200	1252960	No. These claims have been echoed by numerous whistleblowers including alleged S4 project
1252960	1260000	Aquarius biologist Dan Burish. Sit tight for a video on him but he claimed nine hangar bays housed
1260000	1267200	UAP and reverse engineered vehicles including the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash at S4. The witness
1267200	1272800	states Wright Patterson and the foreign technology division is a red herring that this is where the
1272800	1277760	Soviets would have immediately come looking quote we faked some stuff going into Wright Patterson
1277760	1283840	and quote it's likely in the early days of the program Wright Pat housed both crashes and biological
1283840	1289520	material and we only have to look at Roswell to guess that this means that either before or during
1289520	1295600	the witness's tenure in the program program duty shifted away from the airbase and any sort of
1295600	1302000	material or crash hiding at Wright Pat from roughly 1969 to 2004 our hoax is perpetrated by
1302000	1306960	the program. Now there is some conflicting information here as I think back to the testimony
1306960	1312960	of Senator Barry Goldwater who in 1975 was Stonewalled by General Curtis LeMay into accessing
1312960	1318960	the blue room at Wright Pat where UAP information and materials were likely stored. Possibly this
1318960	1324640	means Wright Pat held a database or record of UAP and program activity but not actual materials
1324880	1330480	and biologics. There were these co-opsites run by the government and the big defense contractors
1330480	1336000	people like Raytheon, Boeing, everyone knows their names but also people like Texas Instruments.
1336000	1341680	It was a whole umbrella but the little guys only got a tiny piece of the puzzle. Some guys from TI
1341680	1346480	would get a piece of something and then be asked to figure out how it works never being told where
1346480	1351360	it came from and on its own I'm sure these eggheads had their suspicions but it's hard to tell if
1351360	1357360	something's actually alien. Raytheon, Boeing, and Texas Instruments are specifically name dropped
1357360	1362560	and we can infer TI is one of the quote-unquote little guys mentioned here as the witness proposes
1362560	1368000	the example of TI getting a little piece of something. Can we find one interesting connection
1368000	1373920	for each of these three companies? Well to start we can find Raytheon name drop specifically alongside
1373920	1380400	Lockheed Martin, Aerospace Corp, TRW, etc. by Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Haish
1380400	1387360	as one of a major aerospace company in which the legacy UAP programs hide. In 1956,
1387360	1392000	Boeing was mentioned in a special weapons study of aviation studies examination of
1392000	1398080	electro-gravity systems. This piece references a project winner haven which suggests construction
1398080	1404080	of a saucer creating a local gravitational field designated to serve as a USAF interceptor.
1404640	1408960	Boeing was one such company mentioned on working on these anti-gravity rigs.
1409600	1415280	When we hear Texas Instruments we think of the TI-84 calculator that got me through college at
1415280	1421600	least I do. But TI also operates within the aerospace and defense industries. Unfortunately,
1421600	1428640	there is not much to confirm here as the only link to TI I can find is a 1961 establishment of the
1428640	1433360	Southwest Center for Advanced Studies by TI to work on gravitational physics.
1433840	1443680	And finally on to everybody's favorite subject the craft. The witness makes a very curious
1443680	1449360	claim. Although he knows these craft can operate in a microgravity medium he does not know if they
1449360	1454400	are really spacecraft and wonders if quote that's where they want us to think they are coming from
1454400	1459920	end quote. The witness comments ufology has done a pretty good job at compiling craft shape.
1459920	1465360	So you got your flying eggs your tic-tacs I guess you now call them we just call them pills your
1465360	1470640	old fashioned saucers bells triangles whole message shapes but the ones that crash are
1470640	1477120	almost always the eggs and the bells. In Aero's data from 1996 to 2023 we can actually find the
1477120	1483120	most commonly reported UAP configurations. Factoring out spheres and lights which in my opinion
1483120	1488880	often have a more possible prosaic explanation than other configurations we can see commonly
1488880	1494160	cited craft shapes accurately reflect our witnesses list. Eggs and bell shapes are the
1494160	1499440	most frequently crashed objects according to our witness sometimes disintegrating on impact
1499440	1504320	and our witness claims these are likely unmanned drones. We have already covered some really
1504320	1509760	interesting and possibly credible eggs and oval shaped objects Eric Tabor and Jonathan Wagan.
1509760	1516400	But what about this bell there is a fascinating and perplexing case that occurred in 1965 in
1516400	1521920	Kecksburg Pennsylvania I plan to cover soon. Allegedly a bell shaped almost acorn object
1521920	1526560	crashed in the area. This case was covered extensively by Leonard Stringfield so if you'd
1526560	1532240	like to brush up before my video I recommend reading his UFO crash retrievals the inner sanctum
1532240	1538400	status report 6 and if you remember from my Robert Sarbacher video Dr. Eric Walker an alleged
1538400	1544080	original program manager claimed to have been on site and at location for this crashed object.
1544080	1549280	Our witness declares the saucers are the crown jewels and he only ever participated in the
1549280	1554320	recovery of two such craft. I probably don't need to dive too much into the importance of
1554320	1560080	discs or saucers in UFO lore but let's see if we can investigate the witnesses aid in a crash
1560080	1565760	retrieval in South America. The saucer we recovered and hit the side of a rocky outcropping on its
1565760	1571840	way down it smashed the rock to pieces then took out a quarter mile of trees if it had happened
1571840	1576400	on the outskirts of civilization the whole UFO mystery would have been public knowledge by now
1576400	1581520	that's how much destruction that thing cost but the craft itself was relatively unharmed.
1581520	1587680	I will be using the date frame 1969 to 2004 I derived earlier for our witnesses time in the
1587680	1592960	program. I can find three relevant cases for my all-time favorite crash retrieval handbook
1592960	1599600	Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood. We will not be covering the 1997 Jonathan Wagan Peru case
1599600	1607040	or the 1978 Moondust retrieval in Bolivia as these craft are explicitly stated as not saucer-like.
1607040	1611920	One example can be found that was also relayed in the notes of Leonard Stringfield dated March
1611920	1618720	23rd 1978. In his notes Stringfield spoke with one Bob Berry who claimed a UFO crash retrieval
1618720	1625920	occurred on November 11th 1975. Berry close to Lima Peru this craft was unmanned and measured 12
1625920	1631440	feet high and 8 feet in diameter. If what our witnesses saying is true and mostly egg slash
1631440	1636240	bells are unmanned this may not be a saucer but still worth mentioning the outer surface was
1636240	1642240	metallic with material deemed to be non-terrestrial. Another possible event occurred in Potorio's
1642240	1648480	Chile 1978 pulled from the files of Bob Pratt also he learned while in the area a year later
1648480	1654000	a tremendous explosion occurred that woke up all 3,000 people in the area all houses shook and
1654000	1658880	everyone thought a blast furnace had exploded. Engineers determined the event was an air burst
1658880	1663760	the explosion occurred in the air and the blast force exerted downwards. Following the crash
1663760	1669600	American operatives and NASA coveralls arrived at the scene questioning witnesses. An American or
1669600	1675600	Soviet spacecraft maybe but when Bob Pratt filed FOIA request to NASA and the CIA they responded
1675600	1680560	they had no data on the event. And we can find a third case that's also mentioned in Stringfield's
1680560	1686720	UFO crash retrieval syndrome status report two new sources new data which discusses an October 3rd
1686720	1693520	1980 saucer crash in Piedra de la Guía, Argentina. Here witnesses in a 300 mile radius saw what
1693520	1699280	appeared to be a saucer shaped fireball come down from the skies and explode near 7 p.m. Some
1699280	1704160	witnesses claim the fireball flew in circles before crashing exhibiting intelligent control.
1704880	1709760	Captain Carlos Lima then head of the space research division of the Argentinian Air Force
1709840	1715840	officially investigated the incident he found four burned spots circular and 10 to 18 meters in
1715840	1722240	diameter and notice what appeared quote to be the product of combustion originated by liquid fuel
1722240	1728240	or some sort of material with a very high temperature end quote could any of these cases are possibly
1728240	1733680	the Varginia Brazil case so excellently covered by James Fox be the crash our witness mentioned
1734320	1738960	when the witness reached the administrative side of the program he learned saucers were formed from
1738960	1745120	a single piece of material or put together at an atomic level quote even the entrance is invisible
1745120	1750560	until it actually opens and quote but interiors could be accessed through destructive and non
1750560	1755600	destructive means I have recently covered two witnesses whose claims mirror these statements
1755600	1761840	identically MS who declared the UFO he observed undergoing inspections at Dugway Proving Ground
1761840	1768080	was quote flawless like it had been 3d printed and RB who claimed the saucer he guarded in
1768080	1774480	1963 had a door panel with tolerances so tight not even a piece of paper could fit through the seams
1779920	1784240	the first mention of biologics comes with the South American saucer retrieval
1784240	1789840	once access was gained to the craft the interior reeked of decaying organic material the quote
1789840	1795920	unquote things inside were dead I call them things on purpose not out of disrespect or anything like
1795920	1800640	that I just don't think any of us were ever convinced they were actually living creatures
1800640	1806320	well not in the sense that you and I are these biologics featured a crude digestive system
1806320	1811440	only enough to process basic proteins and such leading the witness and program to believe these
1811440	1817120	things were similar to biological androids the typical gray alien depicted in media is
1817120	1821840	allegedly accurate but these beings are a little taller than the famous humanoids and possess
1821840	1827360	large but not massive eyes the witness remarks how these beings were raised in a dimly lit
1827360	1832800	environment supported by their dimly lit craft these creatures feature long limbs and knees
1832800	1838880	quote not in the right places end quote the subject of almost android like living beings has been
1838880	1845280	echoed by many including dr gary nolyn I think that part of what we are seeing here I mean look
1845360	1852640	if you're an intelligence are you gonna go down on a planet with a bunch of angry monkeys
1852640	1859680	who might kill you no unlikely you'll send some intermediary well what kind of intermediary
1859680	1864720	you're gonna send you're gonna send something that maybe almost looks like them but isn't them
1864720	1870880	so I think and this is again from inside the intelligence community most of what we think
1870880	1880880	we're seeing are avatars biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions
1881440	1890880	if you will and that's that's the current view of that's a that is a it is a hypothesis living
1890880	1896480	by a logics had been recovered by our witness specifically at a near UK based retrieval this
1896480	1902160	event occurred at the same time of a meteor strike in the UK area and I actually think I may have
1902160	1909120	found this incident this story occurred in May of 1996 in Boyle Ireland locals witnessed a meteor
1909120	1915040	or an aerial craft heading towards land appearing to misjudge its approach shearing trees and landing
1915040	1921120	in the lake allegedly several occupants were taken into custody by a retrieval team and significant
1921120	1927280	military activity including American soldiers continued for the following six months even
1927280	1932640	local police were instructed to stay away the American soldier bit here is key as our witness
1932640	1937440	states Europe has a default agreement with the United States that recovered materials go to the
1937440	1943680	US but quote that's the price you pay for having a superpower watch your back at this crash site
1943680	1949200	the witness states two of five of the craft's crew survived light bruising covered the dead from
1949200	1954720	the hard landing the program has ruthlessly strict protocols for dealing with live biologics
1954720	1960640	according to our witness these rules include never leveling a weapon at a bean and for that matter
1960640	1966080	security is positioned well away and out of sight from the biologics immediately taking
1966080	1971680	readings to ensure nothing toxic or hazardous is present near the craft and medical personnel
1971680	1977920	are then sent to the craft area or interior including the lead doctor known as the ambassador
1977920	1984560	who always spoke at least english chinese spanish and russian the biologics at this uk crash just
1984560	1990320	stood around aimlessly solely reacting to basic stimuli as the team entered the craft after the
1990320	1996800	door opened on its own the beans were even let out of the craft like school children in this
1996800	2002160	instance and almost any other where live biologics were recovered the witness remarks the beans live
2002160	2007920	at most a few days before they keel over dead these points alongside the fact that beans could
2007920	2013280	breathe earth's atmosphere are used by the witness to support the hypothesis they are like drones or
2013280	2018880	biological computers like gary nolan said whatever's making these things just creates a biological
2018880	2024240	crew when it needs one and they do their job and nothing else at least that was our theory because
2024240	2028880	their bodies didn't seem built to last and the eggheads found it suspicious that they were able
2028960	2034640	to breathe our atmosphere so easily of course we do not have access to any living or deceased
2034640	2040480	nhi biologics in the public sector so are there at least any parallels we can draw from the witness
2040480	2046000	the subject of biologics and their taxonomy is one of the most contentious subjects in uap the
2046000	2052320	visual of the classic gray alien small beans varying in color with elongated limbs frail bodies
2052320	2058400	enlarged head large to enormous eyes tiny to non-existent noses and mouths have been echoed
2058400	2065120	since the dawn of uap lore from roswell to kingman to abductee claims to myriad files in the lennard
2065120	2071040	string field files similar descriptions of non-human biologics pop up everywhere and this
2071040	2075520	isn't mentioning countless accusations of the program being in possession of living and dead
2075520	2081280	beans unfortunately this is also one of the most lied about and hoaxed aspects of the phenomenon
2081280	2087360	so for now we must stick to the direct confirmation of biological retrieval confirmed by grush sometimes
2087360	2093120	you encounter um dead pilots and relate statements of quote little gray men whose ships had crashed
2093120	2098320	or had been shot down being kept on ice by the air force technology division at right paterson
2098320	2103760	air force base end quote as stated by former special assistant to the deputy director of the cia
2104320	2109280	victor marchetti our witness goes back to pondering why it is saucers and maybe one or two other
2109280	2114000	types actually have a manned crew i'm guessing maybe one of these is the triangular shape the
2114000	2120080	witness in the program had a theory quote this was all being fabricated for us and even tasked
2120080	2125920	nasa to look for where something like a big 3d printer could be in the solar system some facility
2125920	2131120	or computer just making these crafts and these things and sending them to earth and sometimes
2131120	2136000	they crashed or they just landed and didn't take off like whatever was doing this wanted us to
2136000	2140880	recover the craft i don't know if they ever found anything though there was some excitement for a
2140880	2146080	while it's hard to hide heat in space and obviously making these crafts on such a large scale
2146080	2151680	would give off a lot of heat or maybe not maybe they use physics we don't even understand these
2151680	2157200	are some very charged statements with a lot to unpack we do know around the time of our witnesses
2157200	2163520	involvement in the program nasa openly denied studying ufo's however we can find a letter to
2163520	2171040	nasa chief of ground operations safety dated december 13th 1977 this page observed only via
2171040	2177200	foyer request is directed towards the nasa administrator about ufo's detailing quote what
2177200	2183600	could be a piece of a ufo end quote was examined at los alamos for a period of over two months
2183600	2190880	additionally on page 121 and 126 of this black vault pdf detailing nasa foyer requests we can see
2191040	2197760	internal memo admit the agency conducted a ufo hard evidence analysis program titled ufo heap
2197760	2204880	around the late 70s and this 3d printer has actually a very real basis in 20th century physics the
2204880	2211520	idea of a universal constructor or self-replicating automata was first proposed in the 1940s by
2211520	2217920	physicist john von neumann who by the way was listed as being involved in ufo recovery along
2217920	2224000	with vanavar bush and robert oppenheimer by physicist robert sarbacher i talked about earlier
2224000	2230000	his theory explores how a sub faster than light civilization can colonize a galaxy the automata
2230000	2235120	involve robotic or nano robotic systems that replicate by creating miniature copies of themselves
2235120	2241680	which grow over time such a feat would require an abundance of material so maybe this heat signature
2241680	2246960	the witness mentioned occurred near our asteroid belt but the replicator hub nestled within the
2246960	2252480	dark regions of a solar system for creating craft and i guess biologics is an extremely plausible
2252480	2258560	scenario this even rings identically to the alleged four-chan whistleblower who stated a ufo
2258560	2263440	replicator lies within our oceans and these statements by our witness quote whatever was
2263440	2268960	doing this wanted us to recover the craft and quote is widely known within ufology as donation
2268960	2275200	craft this subject has been touched on by david grush call it spacecraft if you will non-human
2275280	2280720	exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed is the subject of eric taber's
2280720	2286720	aero testimony as this egg-shaped craft was simply found untouched in the desert and features
2286720	2293200	in many corners of ufology the witness makes multiple mentions to failed in 1990s successful
2293200	2301040	attempts to down uap craft one failure occurred in iran and i am almost positive this is the 1976
2301040	2306960	iran major jeffari case the successful downing of uap craft is something i have covered often
2306960	2312560	including in my last video where witness tb states the usg developed technology within the star wars
2312560	2318240	program to down craft people have been hurt by these craft according to the witness but theorizes
2318240	2323600	this is incidental and a byproduct of the craft themselves manned or unmanned the craft have
2323600	2329760	the ability to distort perception and mess with minds quote unquote anchors were formed for recovery
2329760	2334960	operatives to keep them grounded in reality for instance if you and i were on a security team
2334960	2339840	and approached a craft would say okay the craft is resting up against a big oak tree and there's
2339840	2344400	a gray boulder on the other side you think of that picture and it would help with the confusion
2344400	2349680	whenever that effect happened kind of warded off this messing with human cognition has been
2349680	2355280	mentioned extensively by dr gary nolan and even mentioned an atyp slide nine leaked from christ
2355280	2361040	for melons personal website and lastly what do they want the witness doesn't know the program
2361040	2366880	strongly supports the donation theory where the craft are gifted maybe the technology is gifted
2366880	2372960	to not cause massive disruption within our own evolution we had another conclusion though this
2372960	2377680	one more disturbing maybe they just left these crafts lying around because they were easy to build
2378400	2383440	hey guys thank you so much for watching as i broke down the infographics whistleblower who
2383440	2390640	claimed to have first-hand experience in the crash retrieval program my objective of this video
2390640	2395440	was to analyze some of these claims relate them to ufology at large as well as try to investigate
2395440	2401680	as much as we could about this whistleblower to see if their testimony and the individual is fact
2401680	2409360	or fiction so i think i feel pretty confident in us being able to kind of determine the time frame
2409360	2415760	of this initial event in vietnam occurring october to december in 1968 in company e 52nd
2415760	2421680	infantry in the first calvary division l r r p close to saigon and south vietnam probably fourth
2421680	2428160	long and i'm pretty confident in five of the eight or nine names i may have messed that up who
2428160	2435520	following died in combat after the initial sighting of the uap from our whistleblower and i'm also
2435520	2441600	pretty confident in this introduction to the program october to december in 1969 and his years
2441600	2450400	of service 1969 to 2004 i'm also medium confident on the three south america crashes and ireland
2450400	2458000	uk crash that occurred in 1996 these are all uh not very known cases pretty kind of low key but
2458000	2463200	you know these kind of fit our timetable fit um fit our interest fit what we were looking for so
2464160	2470560	guys i do have a theory on who this whistleblower might be i now this could very well be false
2471440	2476160	i don't think it holds much water more so than dates and kind of interesting coincidences lining
2476160	2482240	up because if i had to put money on it i do think this whistleblower is offering some uh true testimony
2482240	2487040	here i don't think this is as simple as just something fictitious is a very interesting
2487040	2492560	testimony and a lot of things that line up to you follow g yet large but the theory remember
2492640	2498160	just a theory uh for those of you who watched my last video the witness tb do you remember the
2498160	2506160	general that he said showed classified uap derived cloaking technology in 2004 and was thus
2506160	2513360	investigated demoted a star and retired this is general john m rigs guys i think it's possible
2513920	2519360	that this whistleblower is this aforementioned general general john m rigs why do i think that
2519360	2528720	well john m rigs enlisted in the u.s army in 1965 was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1969
2529520	2536480	and he then went on to achieve 1100 hours of flight time earning himself a distinguished cross
2537520	2543200	remember what he said in theater in vietnam a rapid reaction unit this would make sense that if he
2543200	2548080	then got his uh flying license in the military helicopter pilot he would have then served on
2548080	2553120	that rapid reaction unit possibly providing perimeter security and and flying the team there
2553680	2560480	right so his time in the military was 1965 when he enlisted 1969 when he was commissioned an officer
2560480	2569440	to 2004 john m rigs was forced to retire in 2004 2005 so this lines up exactly with our witnesses
2569440	2574800	tenure in the program as well and our witness states eventually he moved over to the administrative
2574800	2581280	side of the program right well john m rigs was promoted to general and higher up in the military
2581280	2588720	worked with congress he was also stationed at a u.s army base in in um i'm trying to look in in
2588720	2595120	germany i'm not quite sure when this is but this would line up with our u uh u k based crash would
2595120	2601120	it not kind of a as our witness says that europe is always ready in a constant state of war that
2601200	2606960	you know these objects are attracted to conflict there um again this theory doesn't hold much
2606960	2611680	water but we know that if this story about john m rigs is true which i do believe it is because
2612480	2622240	i do with the credibility of of tb's claims mr rigs is also well aware of uap drive tech
2622240	2627280	reverse engineering and crash retrieval efforts and let's not forget once he retired after allegedly
2627280	2632960	showing a bae systems employee classified technology he went on to then serve as an aviation
2632960	2639840	and strategic defense consultant so not much besides dates and i don't want to kick off an
2639840	2643840	investigation i can't control because there's still so much more to investigate with this but
2643840	2649520	that is my little theory right now um if you guys have watched this and you have another theory
2649520	2654160	let me know what it is because i'm i'm investigating i really want to get to the bottom of this because
2654160	2659600	this is such an interesting story and as we can see that a 25 minute video takes over 40 minutes
2659600	2664560	to kind of analyze and not just watching the video right like you guys know i'm not just a
2665600	2670640	screen cap in the video plan me pausing every couple of minutes and giving my thoughts no we're
2670640	2674960	linking documents we're linking cases we're linking relevant video footage and clips so
2675840	2681040	yeah that shows you how much meat is on the bone of this specific case i think it's enthralling
2681040	2686400	and i really have tried to get in contact with the infographics team everything short of paying
2686400	2690640	to to become a member of theirs to join their discord which i i just might at this point
2690640	2695360	because i really want to find this out but i hope you guys have just as great of a time
2695920	2700480	kind of sifting through this video as i did in and joining me on this venture as we try to learn
2700480	2706880	more about this whistleblower and determine if this is a real individual and real experience
2706880	2712160	i know i find the um the biologics the androids one of the most interesting things ever since
2712160	2720160	grush came out last summer of 2023 and talked about biologics that statement as he testified to
2720160	2726160	congress biologics dead pilots as he said to ross colthart has enthralled me and and hearing gary
2726160	2730960	nolan talk about the hypothesis of biological androids that's just something i found so interesting
2731600	2736560	if any of you guys listen to the podcast mysterious universe i think this was back in 2017 i can't
2736560	2742880	remember exactly when they did a show on this exact subject kind of like the classic grays being a
2742880	2750000	biological android so for the better part of a decade now i've been thinking about this theory
2750000	2754320	it's just been so interesting to my head so you know watching this whistleblower say that these
2754320	2759600	biologics are like children respond to basic stimuli keel over and dead and die when their purpose
2759600	2763600	is done it's just so fascinating to me so in the comments guys let me know what you think please
2763600	2766880	remember to like and subscribe always remember i got a patreon if you think the channel's worth
2766880	2771440	anything i don't gatekeep any content uh just support what you think the channel's worth and uh
2771440	2774640	please let me know what you think i'd love to get some more discussion around this video and i
