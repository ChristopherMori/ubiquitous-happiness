0	5220	What's going on guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so much for joining me for this in-person
5220	9760	interview with UMC Vet and Arrow whistleblower Michael Herrera.
9760	13020	Before we get into this interview, there's just a couple things I want to touch on.
13020	16980	I co-hosted this interview with my good friend Joey is not my name.
16980	21080	Many of you will remember him from my first video on Michael or have seen him around Reddit
21080	25580	and Twitter as one of the first people to really start investigating Michael's claims
25580	29600	of his experience in 2009 in Indonesia seriously.
29600	33400	When we sat down to conduct this interview, we sought to really ask some of the lesser
33400	38040	asked questions and lesser known details of Michael's encounter in 2009 and his claims
38040	40720	of meeting a Black program insider.
40720	44680	So we do kind of expect you to be somewhat familiar with Michael's story, at least know
44680	48880	the base details of his 2009 experience and his follow-up claims.
48880	52580	If you haven't, I highly recommend checking out my original video on Michael that I did
52580	56520	with Joey or watch his Sean Ryan show podcast appearance.
56520	59240	Both are fantastic videos, I highly recommend checking them out.
59280	62760	If you're not too familiar with Michael's story, if you'll remember back to my Marines
62760	67360	and UFOs video, you'll recall this is the first time I ever covered Michael's story
67360	70720	and I was super dismissive of him, super skeptical.
70720	74760	That's why after all these months of talking to Joey, talking to Michael, sharing meals
74760	79560	with Michael, hosting Joey and conducting this interview, I'm super excited to revisit
79560	85240	this case as it's one I've been privately investigating on my own for quite a while.
85240	89960	So without further ado, please enjoy this interview with Joey is not my name and Michael
89960	90960	Herrera.
100960	105280	So you guys get to the top of the hill and of course this is when you observe this object.
105280	108720	Who, which part of your team first observed this?
108720	114680	It had to have been, it wasn't me, it was somebody else and they were more pointing
114680	116480	like, what is that?
116480	121160	And so this was a big misconception for me at first, Joey had to kind of help me visualize
121160	124200	this as I'm sure it was for a lot of other people too.
124200	129320	You guys only saw the top triangular section and some lights of this.
129320	133240	Not really lights, lights didn't happen until the thing actually took off.
133240	137440	But you can see, I mean, if you're going to try to think that these are two trees, right?
137440	140280	And that's kind of like where you can see the top part of it, but then you see the other
140280	143840	part, but you can't make out the whole size of it, right?
143840	146120	Because you have trees and everything distorting it.
146120	150120	So really only we saw was something changing colors often this little thing that I had
150120	153120	visual on and you see it moving around.
153120	155000	It's like, it's not a building.
155000	158920	I mean, we thought it was a building at a point, but I mean, it's just off in the distance
158920	164520	right there and it's changing colors and something that you have green vegetation sticks out like
164520	165520	a sore thumb.
165520	168720	It's easier to say if it was a building because I mean, you'd expect kind of buildings to
168720	172560	be in that area, but this area didn't have any of those buildings, didn't have anything
172560	173560	like that.
173560	176800	So who made the decision to kind of go forward and check this out?
176800	177800	It wasn't me.
177800	181880	And it was the person in charge and that's who was the one that did that.
181880	185800	As you approach the object, you could only still see just above the tree line, the top
185800	186800	of the object.
186800	187800	You could see the whole thing.
187800	193480	Yeah, so when we got down that hill and it was something we weren't allowed to do obviously
193480	197680	because you're not supposed to abandon your, whatever your post is.
197680	199320	Yeah, I'm curious about that.
199320	207120	Can you describe what was going on at the LZ at the time where you guys decided, I mean,
207120	212720	to make this decision, this risky decision to go and check out whatever this was?
212720	215240	So I don't remember much going on at the LZ.
215240	218400	I just remember taking video of that helicopter that was off in the distance.
218400	220040	It wasn't like it was super close.
220040	226280	Did you guys feel like that helicopter was part of your responsibility to guard or was
226280	227280	it like?
227280	230920	I just assumed that there probably was other people there or probably other Marines on
230920	233560	board that they were probably dropping off in that area.
233560	235280	That would be my assumption.
235280	241400	I don't remember thinking anything like that back then, you know, 14, 15 years ago.
241400	245640	Yeah, I mean, I can imagine, you know, whatever you guys saw.
245640	251320	Well, something that wasn't, it was abnormal and, you know, yeah, curiosity is a good thing
251320	252320	to an extent.
252320	255560	But I tell people all the time, curiosity is what kills a cat.
255560	258520	And it's something in this way that it changed our lives.
258520	260960	Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't a light decision.
260960	266640	It was a risky decision and you guys made the choice and, I mean, we didn't even rack
266640	267640	around in the chamber.
267640	273040	It's just like we weren't expecting to really get into anything like that.
273040	275120	You know, it was just walking down, trying to see what that is.
275120	278560	And then if it wasn't nothing, we're just going to go back up the hill and resume to
278560	279560	what we were doing.
279560	282480	And obviously it led to what we experienced.
282480	286080	When you're walking, you know, you guys are at the top of the hill.
286080	289360	The decision is made to go check this thing out.
289360	294120	And at the top of the hill, you don't actually see any people.
294120	296160	You didn't see those, the trucks yet.
296160	299240	You're just seeing the top of the craft.
299240	304480	So you guys go down the moment of interception with these guys.
304480	307840	Can you describe?
307840	314760	I think, I think what gets lost on a lot of people is how fast it happened and how quickly
314760	316840	they took control of the situation.
316840	319320	I mean, what was your first impression when you saw these guys?
319320	321800	Well, I heard people yelling at us.
321800	323000	That's what got my attention.
323000	328000	And when we saw weapons in their hands pointed at us, you're not going to move, you're not
328000	331320	going to raise your weapon up because obviously that's the point.
331320	335360	And then obviously, and during the briefing, I had touched on in numerous interviews that
335360	339680	there was a possible SEAL team that was out there trying to handle things that they were
339680	340680	tasked on.
340680	342640	What they were specifically doing, I don't know.
342640	345520	But I remember in the ward room that that's what they were talking about, having some
345520	349480	sort of element of US Navy SEALs there.
349480	352800	And for a second, we thought it may have been them and we're just like, oh, shit, here's
352800	353800	these guys.
353800	357800	You know, they don't, then obviously we were going to talk or something or just go, but
357800	363100	these guys were not, these guys were not carrying themselves as SEALs and they didn't have anything
363100	364960	identifying on them.
364960	369000	And obviously they were screaming at us, telling us to put our weapons, you know, put our hands
369000	371780	up in the air because we had slings on our stuff, right?
371780	375760	So that's when we're putting our hands up in the air and every single one of us did the
375760	376760	same thing.
376760	379840	It's not like, I mean, how are we going to raise a weapon that doesn't even have a full
379840	380840	chamber?
380840	382480	What are you going to do at that point?
382480	386560	If you even rack that round and try to bring it up, they've already got their muzzles pointed
386560	387720	at you.
387720	392160	It's almost like a police officer coming up to your vehicle when they do a traffic stop
392360	396160	and they feel threatened or they may have an indication that your vehicle matches the
396160	400040	description of somebody who has had a gun pointed at them, for example, where they would
400040	403380	believe that it's reasonable suspicion for them to deploy their firearm.
403380	406960	Are you going to move suddenly and make him think you're going to reach for something
406960	408400	and he just blasts you?
408400	409400	No.
409400	412640	And how did these men approach you in a tactical column, a pincer?
412640	414440	We were the one that was in a tactical column.
414440	419520	They had, so if I was looking at this and we kind of started, and that's when we naturally
419520	424680	kind of spread out like walking towards them, and that's when they basically had four guys
424680	428520	on this side and they have four guys on this side.
428520	433040	And I talked to numerous special operators about this type of tactic and they called
433040	438200	a nosebleed, which is where they have basically interlocking fields of fire with this direction
438200	439200	on one target.
439200	447480	It's a very rookie, easy thing to do and these guys, they already had that position.
447480	451360	So it tells me that maybe there could have been more operators that were around that
451360	455500	area, maybe on the other side of the craft, on the other side of where the trucks may
455500	460000	have went off, which I didn't see them go off anywhere.
460000	464000	But from what I've been told, there was more than just those guys there.
464000	469280	So if we would have gotten into any kind of conflict, we were severely outnumbered already.
469280	472300	At what point did the craft become fully visible?
472300	475920	When we got to the bottom of the hill and we walked a little bit forward and it started
475920	477400	to clear out.
477400	479080	And that's when this thing was just sitting there.
479080	481640	And then the men approached you right after you noticed it?
481640	482640	Correct.
482640	485320	As soon as we broke that threshold of getting into that clearing is where they basically
485320	486520	had us intercepted.
486520	489920	It's not like we could run behind anything because you can't.
489920	490920	Right.
490920	495480	And the trees weren't like big red oak trees where you could hide behind.
495480	502120	I remember the trees probably being as big as this water bottle, at least how thick,
502120	505160	probably a little bit thicker, but that's not enough to stop anything.
505600	508840	It's not enough to hide behind and not get hit.
508840	514160	So everybody has the whole, they think they're John Wick until they're in that situation,
514160	517120	but it's like I would like to see anybody else in that situation to see what they would
517120	518120	have done.
518120	521640	Because knowing what type of operators we encountered now that I've already been through
521640	527880	all of this, been briefed on it, been included to an extent, none of us would have been a
527880	530280	match for those guys.
530280	534160	And so what did these men do as they trained the rifles on you as they approached you?
534160	536760	So they were pointed, they were screaming at us.
536760	542080	You could actually hear them flip everything off safe because it's not a bull click.
542080	546120	And where we were at, obviously, there's not a lot of noise coming from the hill obviously
546120	550120	because everything that's going on over there is basically silent because you have a hill
550120	551560	blocking everything.
551560	555320	And then the craft's not emitting any kind of noise except for that little hum or that
555320	556320	guitar amp.
556320	559960	I mean, it's not exactly like a guitar amp or like a transformer, but something similar
559960	560960	to that.
560960	564120	You actually replicated pretty good to an extent.
564120	569480	So and that wasn't as audible compared to when everything started to go on and when
569480	574480	they had us, because we weren't at the, where we just broke that threshold, right?
574480	578280	We actually pulled up a little bit more as they were telling us to.
578280	581840	And so they had their weapons on every single one of us.
581840	586160	And there was only six of us, there was eight of them, which means that it's easy for them
586160	589760	just to, I mean, I don't even know if their weapons are full auto.
589760	591280	And they probably could be.
591280	594280	There's or not, there are only three round bursts or semi-automatic and most of the time
594280	599200	they teach us to shoot in a semi-automatic, you know, one round per person, a kill shot
599200	600200	at least.
600200	601200	So, I mean, it's not a head shot.
601200	604800	I mean, you have a T-Box and what you're trained for combat marksmanship, but these guys could
604800	607680	have full automatic M4s.
607680	612080	I wouldn't have rolled it out, you know, which means that they just need to, each person
612080	615520	doing a couple round bursts, three to five round bursts, I mean, it's going to get everybody
615520	616520	where we were at.
616960	624320	Now, one thing that people bring up is, you know, you did have, you had your camera,
624320	628560	at the top of the hill, you actually got some pictures of what you guys were seeing.
628560	632280	I remember at least a couple of photographs, but I remember a video as well.
632280	633280	That's right.
633280	635920	I remember a video and that's when I had a dump pouch, which all of us did have a dump
635920	641280	pouch, but I had it right here all the time and that's where we basically put expended
641280	644560	magazines because you're not going to drop them because you have to reuse them.
644560	650720	So it also helped, too, if you had carry extra ammo because if you had some malfunction
650720	656640	or sometimes we use the saws with, because my had regular saw drum pouches on my stuff,
656640	661120	where I could put a drum here and a drum here and then I had grenade pouches up here.
661120	665440	And most of the time, I would just put magazines and whatever the easiest side to reach was
665440	666840	and that's basically what I had.
666840	671920	So we didn't have like M4 or M16 pouches.
671920	677640	I had saw drum pouches where I had all the mags in, which we had a combat load, six mags.
677640	678640	They disarmed you, right?
678640	679640	Yes.
679640	684240	That was kind of their first, like once they approached you, you described how they were
684240	687200	very methodical and how they did that.
687200	691920	They wanted to gain control of the situation, which they had that control, right, but they're
691920	696680	going to sleep better because they took our weapons from us and slung them and going through
696680	698800	making sure that we had our magazines out.
698800	702640	It wasn't like they were spending us like some law enforcement officer checking you,
702640	704800	tracking around your ankles, anything like that.
704800	705960	They're not doing that.
705960	709480	The only thing that they searched us with was our military IDs where they knew they were
709480	713920	at, which is what my suspicion was that these guys were former military at some point because
713920	716560	they knew exactly where our IDs were.
716560	720320	And you said they interacted with your IDs with something that what we would recognize
720320	721840	today as a modern day smartphone.
721840	722840	Yes.
722840	725520	So they had something that I referred to as a bat system that we were trained on, which
725520	728000	is like a biometrics and tracking system.
728000	732400	It could be the acronym for it, but I just remember saying bats.
732400	734260	And they tried that first.
734260	736080	So they put that away and they had these things.
736080	739040	I mean, it wasn't like, because iPhones were kind of bulky back in the day and they had
739040	744560	blackberries and I had a Sony Ericsson MP3 phone that was pretty bulky.
744560	748160	And they had something that was really thin.
748160	749440	And that's what they were using.
749440	755160	So it could have been something that was comparable, but then again, I don't know.
755160	757240	So while you're getting searched, the craft is in the background.
757240	760680	For anybody that hasn't heard you describe this craft, can you tell us what it looks
760680	761680	like?
761680	768680	So I remember as, because there was corners, which means to me it was an octagonal shape.
768680	771640	Actually, could you, would you mind drawing it for us?
771640	772640	Let's see.
772640	773640	I got pens over here.
773640	774640	Let me, yeah, let's...
774640	776200	I like that idea.
776200	777200	That would be cool.
777200	778200	And you know what?
778200	779200	I'm going to move.
779200	781200	All right.
781200	783880	So what did this thing, what did this craft look like?
783880	784880	Okay.
784880	786960	So this is going from our point of view, right?
786960	787960	That I can remember.
787960	789960	So I'm just going to say this is like vegetation, right?
789960	792680	And this is to represent that clearing.
792680	797160	What I remember is kind of like a pyramid shape at the top like this, because I remember
797160	802280	seeing some shading and some were kind of brighter than others.
802280	803280	Like this.
803280	810440	Then I remember it doing like this and then it had corners, right?
810440	814080	This may be looking a little bit strange, but this is just a rough draft.
814080	816400	It used to be a better artist back in the day.
816400	821360	And I remember seeing these vents, at least that's what it looks like on each of the corners
821360	822360	like this.
822360	831080	So there's a vent here, and it was like it was positioned on the lines, like this.
831080	837960	And then on each corner, when this thing took off, it had lights that would pop on, which
837960	841800	would have been like red, yellow, green, and blue are the only ones I remember that kind
841800	844400	of had a line that went like this.
844400	853240	And it had some sort of scale pattern that I estimate is octagonal, but it could honestly
853240	856080	be circular, it could be square.
856080	864280	I wasn't close enough to depict it, but this is where this was the blackest, darkest thing
864280	865960	that I have ever seen in my life.
866480	870000	It's almost like light got absorbed into this, and I don't know if this is just because
870000	871000	of the craft.
871000	878560	It may help with a function, but there's probably third graders or something that say they can
878560	882400	probably do a better job than this, and I'd probably agree with them.
882400	885040	So now what about the platform?
885040	889200	Platform underneath was kind of like it was raised like this, not off the ground, but
889200	890440	just like an incline.
890760	896920	And it went underneath like this, and it was around the same kind of length as a craft,
896920	903360	and it had kind of some points on it as well, which obviously it fits under the craft when
903360	904840	we saw that happen.
904840	911120	And it wasn't like where we were at, I would say this is approximately even the same distance
911120	911920	as it was.
911920	916240	There was not like there was any light or materials on here that I remember seeing.
916240	919680	But then you have, I'm going to draw stick figures.
919800	923240	So I'm just going to draw them black, because these are black team guys.
923240	935480	I know this is not a van Gogh or a Mona Lisa drawer, but I'm just trying to gather everybody's
935480	940960	attention to see how, what I can recall as this and all these guys, and we were essentially
940960	946800	in this area kind of online, four, five, six, right?
946800	953480	We weren't like evenly spaced out, but you guys can kind of see how there's six of us,
953480	955680	there's eight of them, they've got good field of view.
955680	960360	We can see this going on the background, and I'm going to draw a line through this, but
960360	964520	basically where the directions or the trucks came from were from our left.
964520	967360	So they're coming up and then they would go like this.
967360	971840	I don't remember seeing them go off the platform and going somewhere else.
971840	975960	I just remember them going on here, but then we're also facing the fact that we're dealing
975960	977920	with these guys at the same time.
977920	980080	So our focus is going back and forth.
980080	983000	One, you don't see anything that looks like that ever.
983000	987680	Two, you're not in a situation where that happens either.
987680	995320	So as I wish there was more details that I can remember aside from that, but that is
995320	998800	what I briefly recall as far as what the craft looked like.
998800	1003760	Besides changing colors from a light matte gray to a dark matte black, the whole thing.
1003760	1006680	And so before this craft took off, what did this platform do?
1006680	1010880	So this craft kind of sunk down a little bit like this.
1010880	1013000	This platform itself raised up.
1013000	1014880	And there were trucks and other crates?
1014880	1016600	I don't remember seeing the trucks.
1016600	1020840	They could have been because where we were at, and mind you, I didn't see it as it started
1020840	1022640	going up.
1022640	1028600	I saw it when we were going back and forth, and the only thing that got my attention and
1028600	1032520	I'm sure it got everybody else's attention, and I'm only speaking from my point of view
1032520	1036480	was the only thing that got my attention was something was moving.
1036480	1039120	And because your eyes are used to attract movement, right?
1039120	1040900	It's just something that gets your attention.
1040900	1047600	So when I saw that raising up, it was already, what I'd estimate, over R, if we're only
1047600	1052200	5, 10 to 6 feet tall, it was probably almost 10 feet off the ground.
1052200	1054920	Did it raise rapidly or in kind of a slow motion?
1054920	1056120	Not super rapid.
1056120	1061360	It was enough to kind of be slow, but still enough to where you could catch it.
1061360	1066840	I don't remember seeing any kind of containers going up with it or trucks or nothing.
1066840	1071760	I just remember seeing the front profile, the truck, with a trailer behind it, and that
1071760	1075320	was why I was able to see that cylinder in front of that container.
1075320	1080000	Let's get another piece of paper and draw the trucks.
1080000	1081800	And actually, I want to show you this too.
1081800	1084000	That drawing is going to be worth a lot of money someday.
1084000	1085000	Oh, yeah.
1085000	1086000	Keep that.
1086000	1087000	Let me do this.
1087000	1089000	Oh, get the signature.
1089000	1090000	Cool.
1091000	1093840	This is probably my favorite part of the interview.
1093840	1094840	You drawing this stuff?
1094840	1095840	It's awesome.
1095840	1096840	I feel like I'm in kindergarten right now.
1096840	1097840	Showing off your colors.
1097840	1098840	It shapes that you recognize.
1098840	1108560	But it's cool because it helps you kind of describe, as you're doing it, you know.
1108560	1112320	All right, so, all right, trucks.
1112320	1115080	All right, so what are these trucks, the containers with them?
1115080	1116320	Could you describe those?
1116320	1117320	Yeah.
1117440	1120240	Like I said, I only saw it from certain profiles.
1120240	1123760	And what I remember distinctly with these, I don't remember seeing like a Ford logo or
1123760	1127240	nothing like a Chevy Duramax on the hood or nothing like that.
1127240	1130520	We obviously were kind of far away in comparison to that.
1130520	1136360	So I'm going to draw three different views or profiles, which I remember seeing these
1136360	1137360	trucks.
1137360	1139960	So the first one's going to be as if it was coming towards us.
1139960	1143800	So there's going to be like a headlight here.
1143800	1149040	There's like a grill, right, a bumper.
1149040	1153440	And I had like a, I remember having like kind of like a hitch is what I'm assuming.
1153440	1159720	And then, there's another headlight here.
1159720	1170680	Again, I'm going to apologize ahead of time that this isn't going to be, I remember seeing.
1170680	1177320	Now, when you say you didn't see logos, like you didn't see Ford or Chevy, but you stated
1177320	1181360	what kind of trucks they were, though, recognize the body style.
1181360	1182360	Yeah.
1182360	1186080	And I would say that their Ford F 350s is what I would assume they were.
1186080	1191480	Did you just say that Uncigno was black dollar or gotcha?
1191480	1197880	What I do recall seeing is I had like these things on the sides here, kind of like vents,
1197880	1199920	but they're not really vents.
1199920	1205840	And it's kind of remind me of what they had on military hummers for night vision.
1205840	1209040	So that's kind of what they had on there, which tells me that they run these at night
1209040	1210560	time as well.
1210560	1215640	And these were like big, aggressive off-road tires, right?
1215640	1217840	Truck bed, okay.
1217840	1224160	You can kind of see these cases, which are Pelican cases on the back.
1224160	1226560	And what are Pelican cases for anybody who doesn't know?
1226560	1232440	I mean, it's a brand, but these are weapons, because we had the same ones that we transport
1232440	1233440	weapons with.
1233440	1234440	And that's just...
1234440	1235840	Do they carry small arms, munitions?
1235840	1238240	Yeah, stuff like that.
1238240	1247120	So then this was hooked to a trailer that had four wheels like this, okay, trailer.
1247120	1256320	And the only thing I remember seeing of this container, I had the ridges kind of like
1256320	1258560	a shipping container, but not much.
1258560	1264600	I had the cylinder that's kind of on the front right here.
1264600	1270400	So I wanted to show you this.
1270400	1274440	Let me just throw this right in front of that, so that camera gets it.
1274440	1276640	What do you think of that?
1276640	1279120	Looks identical, but then again...
1279120	1281960	Now, the other thing...
1281960	1286240	I remember seeing it having four or two tires on each side, right?
1286240	1288720	So a dual axle, yep.
1288720	1296840	So this was another thing I found where they actually have the Connex box on top of it.
1296840	1302280	With more aggressive tires, but this looks shockingly familiar.
1302280	1304280	Because that's like the type of...
1304280	1305880	I mean, that's a shipping crate, you know?
1305880	1310680	I think this is called a TriCon configuration, so they're all standardized, like the sizes
1310680	1312960	and stuff.
1312960	1313960	And these were outfitted.
1313960	1319360	They had these cylinders on the front right here that would come to find out it's actually
1319360	1320360	oxygen supply.
1320360	1321360	Yeah.
1321360	1322840	So draw those cylinders.
1322840	1323840	Okay.
1323840	1329640	So I'm going to black it out completely because the cylinder itself was black, and that's why...
1329640	1333760	And initially, when you saw this, you hypothesized this might be humidity control for something
1333760	1334760	like drugs.
1334760	1335760	Or drugs, right?
1335760	1339960	That's what I testified to Aaron with, because I didn't think it was people.
1339960	1344120	That was in my thought process at the time.
1344120	1348160	And we'll talk about Aero in a little bit, but so you testified to Aero before you did
1348160	1349960	the NPC in June of 2023.
1349960	1350960	Yes.
1350960	1351960	Okay.
1351960	1352960	Yep.
1352960	1353960	That was...
1353960	1355800	I had testified last year to Aero.
1355800	1356800	It was late April.
1356800	1357800	Okay.
1357800	1358800	Late April, 2023.
1358800	1359800	Okay.
1359800	1360800	Late April, 2023.
1360800	1361800	Yep.
1361800	1364800	All right.
1364800	1366400	So that's kind of the view that...
1366400	1368840	That's really good.
1368840	1371800	So and then obviously the side view...
1371800	1375320	So cylinders basically spanning the whole width of the container.
1375320	1376320	Yeah.
1376320	1377320	Correct.
1377320	1378320	It wasn't like a small one.
1378320	1379320	It was just a whole width.
1379320	1380320	Correct.
1380320	1381320	All right.
1381320	1385320	So here's where the tires would be from the side profile of that trailer.
1385320	1389760	Of course, there was no white wheel as it was all black.
1389760	1394840	I remember seeing kind of the back.
1395840	1396840	Okay.
1396840	1405440	And then this container right here.
1405440	1408160	This is the cylinder from a side view.
1408160	1409160	Okay.
1409160	1413080	Truck bed right here.
1413080	1415120	How many trucks total do you remember seeing?
1415120	1416120	Four.
1416120	1417120	Four.
1417120	1418840	And did each one also have weapons crates or just...
1418840	1419840	Yes.
1419840	1420840	Each one of them had these...
1420840	1422520	What you would call pelican cases.
1422520	1423520	Okay.
1423640	1426800	But just weapons cases is what they definitely look like.
1426800	1428360	Were the cases opened, closed?
1428360	1429360	Closed.
1429360	1430360	Okay.
1434360	1436600	And the windows are remember being kind of dark.
1436600	1437600	So...
1437600	1442400	Could you recall any other operators or people in the trucks besides just the drivers?
1442400	1447800	I remember one truck that went on the platform and now the door, at least some of the doors
1447800	1448800	open.
1448800	1449800	I can't recall.
1449800	1452400	Were there any people standing on the platforms?
1452400	1453400	Yeah.
1453400	1454720	I don't remember.
1454720	1460020	But I don't remember seeing people on the platforms.
1460020	1461020	So that is kind of...
1461020	1462920	And these are black, of course, right?
1462920	1468120	So that's a side view of what that is, right?
1468120	1469120	Okay.
1469120	1472840	Which, I mean, obviously these were black, the shipping container was black, everything
1472840	1473840	like that.
1473840	1477000	The other profile I'm going to draw is going to be from the rear.
1477000	1479440	Did each truck have a shipping container attached to it?
1479440	1480440	Yes.
1480440	1481440	Okay.
1481440	1483280	So here's a container right here.
1483280	1484480	I don't remember seeing the bars.
1484480	1485480	Hatch doors on the back.
1485480	1486480	Yep.
1486480	1487480	Like this.
1487480	1488480	Okay.
1488480	1498720	Can't really see the cylinder at this point, but I'll just indicate it being there.
1498720	1502280	You also said that they were up armored?
1502280	1503280	Yeah.
1503280	1504280	I mean, it's so...
1504280	1505520	What did you mean by that?
1505520	1509200	So they looked a little beefier, thicker material, you know what I mean?
1509200	1511360	Like they look like they'd be bullet resistant.
1511360	1512360	Okay.
1512920	1516080	You can see a regular truck and they're kind of like, okay, it's a regular truck, but these
1516080	1517800	look like they were reinforced.
1517800	1519880	Kind of like a secret service car?
1519880	1522440	Yeah, to an extent, but...
1522440	1523440	Okay.
1523440	1524440	All right.
1524440	1531640	So there's a container like that, which we're not elevated, but this is just to put perspective
1531640	1538640	of the truck and just so how we were seeing it from the back.
1538640	1542280	That's the only views that I remember seeing these trucks.
1542560	1545360	Because you were in front of the craft and they kind of came out in a little bit of a
1545360	1546360	circle.
1546360	1547840	The left side like this and then went up that direction.
1547840	1548840	Okay.
1548840	1549840	It wasn't like they went straight.
1549840	1551480	They were going up to that platform.
1551480	1552480	Okay.
1552480	1553480	So you see the craft.
1553480	1556480	You're basically getting weapons checked, weapons stripped from this team.
1556480	1557720	What happens then?
1557720	1559720	So they're going through each of us, taking our stuff.
1559720	1562880	They take our magazines out of our pouches and they kick them off.
1562880	1566680	They got one guy off in a distance that I remember was a standoff distance, like more
1566680	1567840	than 10 feet.
1567840	1571120	So obviously we tried to run and grab our stuff and he's just going to light this up
1571120	1572120	if he wanted to.
1572160	1575200	They had a different rifle platform to the main guys.
1575200	1576200	So same load out with all of them.
1576200	1577200	They all had the same stuff.
1577200	1578200	Yeah.
1578200	1580680	They had the same kind of, I mean they may have different attachments, but I remember
1580680	1586960	most of the parts seeing ACOGs on each one of them with the PEC-16 illuminators on those.
1586960	1589040	Those is what I remember seeing.
1589040	1595320	One thing I've always been curious about, did you notice any of them like talking on
1595320	1596320	the radio to someone?
1596320	1598320	One guy had a radio and I don't remember him talking to anybody.
1598320	1603280	I just remember seeing it and with the antenna coming up that he had pressed to his vest.
1603280	1607240	But he was the main guy that was kind of telling people what to do.
1607240	1610960	And he was mainly the one besides another guy that was, you know, and shit, it was like
1610960	1611960	he will fucking kill you.
1611960	1614400	You know, it's easy to get lost out here, etc.
1614400	1621360	Did it seem like, you know, when they intercepted you guys, obviously there were other guys
1621360	1627840	in the trucks doing their thing, did you have the impression that like all of a sudden there
1627840	1630360	were like, oh shit, we need to wrap this up and get out?
1630360	1632880	Or were they kind of just not really even caring about what was going on?
1632880	1636400	I don't think they were kind of caring was they may have not even saw what was going
1636400	1637400	on.
1637400	1638400	They could have.
1638400	1640400	I mean, I don't know that speculation at this point.
1640400	1644480	Yeah, clearly we're getting into speculation there.
1644480	1650320	But yeah, I'm just, it's like I also think about the fact that this, you know, the earthquake,
1650320	1653840	you know, the whole reason this operation was there was because there was an earthquake
1653840	1660080	on it was the end of or the first of September or end of October.
1660080	1665760	It was the end of September and then I think it was September 30th, if I'm not mistaken.
1665760	1666760	Don't quote me on that.
1666760	1667760	Yeah.
1667760	1668760	Yeah.
1668760	1669760	No, I think that's I think that's correct.
1669760	1675480	So and then, you know, the Denver shows up on the ninth.
1675480	1681280	So we're, you know, nine, 10 days after the initial earthquake and, you know, just, you
1681280	1686320	know, obviously speculation here, but it's like, it kind of seems weird that why would
1686320	1691480	this operation be occurring nine days after the earthquake?
1691480	1696080	You know, of course, afterwards you've kind of been told like what that operation was
1696080	1703160	all about and, you know, recruiting people in disaster or struck in areas.
1703160	1707640	But who's to say that was like maybe they had been conducting those same operations
1707640	1708640	all week long.
1708640	1709800	They could have been.
1709800	1710800	They could have been.
1711160	1715840	And believe me, those are some questions I've asked some of these gentlemen that I'm working
1715840	1720040	with and they, you know, they don't know because everything's compartmentalized.
1720040	1724120	I'm hoping one day maybe one of them that I come across does know because I'm going
1724120	1730680	to ask him a lot of questions because I mean, I mean, just like anybody listening or watching
1730680	1735120	to this or anybody who wants this to come out and come forward, I'm a hundred percent
1735120	1736120	with them.
1736120	1737800	I want this to come full circle just like anybody else.
1737800	1739480	I'm just as impatient.
1739480	1744360	The only difference that separates me from anybody else is the experience, but also having
1744360	1748080	knowledge of what's going on to an extent, at least with what I've been exposed to.
1748080	1750560	I just have a little bit more information.
1750560	1754440	So you get to the point, you know, they're threatening you, they give you your weapons
1754440	1760960	back and tell you to go, you know, back, back up the hill, don't go back.
1760960	1767040	When you get to the top of the hill, what do you see happening at the LZ?
1767040	1772760	I just remember me because I remember once we broke the top and all of a sudden I remember
1772760	1774680	seeing some of our guys just start running.
1774680	1776720	So I'm following suit with them, right?
1776720	1780280	Because if anything's going to happen to us, it's going to get the attention of everybody
1780280	1781640	else.
1781640	1787480	And I remember seeing some people, but it wasn't like it was like close up.
1787480	1792080	I just remember when we ran back, we had our weapons strapped to our back that were very
1792080	1795240	tight, uncomfortably tight, right?
1795240	1797760	Because it's compressing your vest.
1797760	1802760	And remember having a gash on my right part of my neck because we had like a yoke or like
1802760	1803880	a collar on our vest.
1803880	1808840	And I remember that when they put that through that it actually kind of the slings we had
1808840	1812640	weren't the best quality and they're not soft.
1812640	1818040	They're plastic and polymer, whatever it is or cloth, whatever material they make out of
1818040	1819040	them and it's very hard.
1819040	1822160	So it kind of cuts you up a little bit.
1822160	1827640	And then I remember us getting back there and I remember seeing a couple people off in
1827640	1831960	the distance as far as some villagers or whoever the civilians were.
1831960	1834600	And there was some other military personnel.
1834600	1837120	I don't remember them being Marines.
1837120	1843080	I don't remember what, they may have been the Indonesian military could have been there,
1843080	1847000	but they were still off kind of at a distance compared to where we were at.
1847000	1850500	And there was this gunnery sergeant that was there and I've never seen this guy before.
1850500	1852120	I don't know if he was attached to the ship.
1852120	1854480	I don't know if he was brought by any other means.
1854480	1856880	I have never seen this guy before.
1856880	1862120	Now gunnery sergeant, you recognize it because you see his rank, right?
1862120	1868400	Now gunnery sergeant, that rank is specific to the Marines, isn't it?
1868400	1869400	Correct.
1869400	1873800	Okay, so when you speculate that maybe he was assigned to the ship or attached to the
1873800	1876240	ship I think you kind of say, what do you mean by that?
1876480	1884760	So each ship, if they're, from my understanding, again, I don't know 100%, but from my understanding
1884760	1890680	there are some ships that have like a combat loading group or somebody who's basically
1890680	1892920	loading Marine stuff onto a ship.
1892920	1896680	I don't know the specific, I can't remember what it's called.
1896680	1898800	They also have some Marines that are red patches.
1898800	1904880	They have a red patch on their cover and then they have red patches on some of their blouse.
1904880	1909800	They have some on their shoulder pocket and some on their cargo pockets.
1909800	1911480	And this guy didn't have those.
1911480	1914040	I thought I can recall anyway.
1914040	1916720	He may have, he may not have, I don't remember.
1916720	1921760	But I remember this rank because obviously it was a little hard to see it because woodlands
1921760	1925920	have black shapes and sometimes it distorts that and if you end up calling somebody by
1925920	1930160	the wrong rank you get to pay for it with pushups or get screamed at, right?
1930160	1934320	So which honestly, if I was in that position I would have screamed at people and tried
1934320	1937160	to fuck with them too for getting my rank wrong.
1937160	1939080	So it happens.
1939080	1947440	But when you ran back to the LZ, you were running towards the helicopter?
1947440	1948440	No.
1948440	1949440	Okay.
1949440	1950440	The helicopter was not there yet.
1950440	1951440	Okay.
1951440	1952440	So what's back?
1952440	1957800	He had a radio that he was talking with and he was communicating with whatever the pilots
1957800	1959960	or whoever it was.
1959960	1964920	So what happened when we got there, he kind of like, first of all, for security, why do
1964920	1967160	we have our weapons slung on our back?
1967160	1968160	That's out of place.
1968160	1971080	No Marines going to have that going on.
1971080	1975120	And that's what I think he was mainly more upset with was because that we were supposed
1975120	1981440	to be our weapons proper, no magazines in, you know, which obviously they put our stuff
1981440	1984440	in, but they put it into where it'd be very inconvenient to try to load it up and then
1984440	1986320	go deal with it.
1986320	1991760	So I think that, thinking back to that, I think that that's mainly why he was upset
1991760	1997880	was because, okay, well, you guys look fucked up is mainly what I would assume, right?
1997880	2000240	I'm just speculating at that point.
2000240	2007600	But I remember us stepping off to the side, off in a distance a little bit, and we're
2007600	2009320	basically squaring ourselves up.
2009320	2014280	We're taking our weapons off of each other, giving it to us, putting a magazine in and
2014280	2017520	having to resume the normal carry.
2017520	2020920	And so this gunnery sergeant is standing just in the clearing where the LZ where you guys
2020920	2021920	were dropped off.
2021920	2022920	Correct.
2022920	2026040	Was he surrounded by a platoon of Marines or was it just this gunnery sergeant?
2026040	2027040	Just him.
2027040	2028040	And other people off in the distance.
2028040	2029040	And other people off in the distance.
2029040	2032280	So they may have linked up and then he probably told them to go away or whatever he was doing.
2032280	2033720	I have no clue.
2033720	2038800	And then because he was on the radio, that's when CH-53 came in and picked everybody up.
2038800	2041880	Now on this CH-53, did you recognize the pilot?
2041880	2043920	Was this the same helicopter that dropped you off?
2043920	2045480	I don't recall any of that.
2045480	2049920	I just remember seeing the CH-53 and that's when it landed and we just boarded up on that
2049920	2050920	thing.
2050920	2051920	I don't remember.
2051920	2056080	I mean, obviously our point of view, I don't remember looking at a pilot I never had a
2056080	2057920	chance to and it's the same thing with this.
2057920	2060480	I don't know specifically who was flying or what.
2060480	2063840	And so nobody said to the gunnery sergeant, what you guys just experienced?
2063840	2064840	No.
2064840	2065840	Okay.
2065840	2070560	So you came to the LZ, you got off the helicopter, that helicopter left, you go to the top at
2070560	2077680	a certain point, a second helicopter comes at a different location, drops off supplies.
2077680	2079840	Was that the one that had a cargo net?
2079840	2080840	Yes it did.
2080840	2083440	Because I took pictures and video of that coming in.
2083440	2093360	So that helicopter is dropping that net and that's when you crest the hill, kind of at
2093360	2098440	some point there, you crest the hill to go investigate the craft.
2098440	2103400	You come back, that helicopter is now gone.
2103400	2107360	What I'm assuming is they dropped the cargo off and then they may have landed and let
2107360	2108360	people out.
2108360	2113520	But by the time you came back, there was no helicopter that was there.
2113520	2117720	That helicopter was gone but then there was obviously the supplies that they had dropped
2117720	2118720	off.
2118720	2119720	Off of the distance.
2119720	2122440	So do you remember seeing what was happening with any of that?
2122440	2123440	Like were there people?
2123440	2127280	I remember seeing people over there and they could have been supplies but they were off
2127280	2128840	at a good distance.
2128840	2134200	And so where the gunnery sergeant was, was he near some supplies too?
2134200	2138560	If I can recall, there could have been some boxes or something he was messing with that
2138560	2141200	was there.
2141200	2145960	There may have been boxes, I don't really recall.
2145960	2153800	I mean, what he have even, is there a chance that he didn't even know you guys were there
2153800	2155440	and he was kind of like.
2155440	2156440	Could have been the case.
2156520	2158800	Like where are you guys coming from?
2158800	2159800	What's going on?
2159800	2160800	It could have been the case.
2160800	2164640	I mean, like I said, I really don't know.
2164640	2165640	It's speculation.
2165640	2169240	But I just remember seeing a gunnery sergeant there who was like, you guys looked fucked
2169240	2172840	up and he was yelling at us for that reason.
2172840	2180160	And so from that period of time to when you left the LZ, you were basically just doing
2180160	2181160	what?
2181160	2183880	Just hanging around, waiting for the helicopter to show up?
2183880	2187720	And we were just kind of walking around by ourselves, of course, trying to make it look
2187720	2190200	like we're secure in the area.
2190200	2191200	Okay.
2191200	2193400	So you kind of resumed that role of security?
2193400	2196920	Even though through our heads, we're going like, what the fuck just happened guys?
2196920	2200480	Were you guys discussing this amongst yourselves or was everybody pretty stone cold?
2200480	2202640	We were stone cold.
2202640	2203640	Nobody wanted to talk about this.
2203640	2205520	Was there any point that you guys discussed it with each other?
2205520	2213040	When we got in town to Subic Bay, the only question I had asked one of them was, are
2213080	2218240	you going to say anything about this or tell your wife and he goes, absolutely not.
2218240	2219440	And that's literally it.
2219440	2223240	And have you encouraged these fellow Marines you were with to come forward and tell their
2223240	2224240	story to?
2224240	2225240	No.
2225240	2226240	Okay.
2226240	2228840	They're not happy with me for obvious reasons.
2228840	2230720	I don't blame them.
2230720	2233800	This wasn't something that, you know, I try to get one of them to help me with this to
2233800	2234800	an extent.
2234800	2239920	And his response, which everybody has seen publicly, was kind of the indicator that
2239920	2242920	something did happen, that something was wrong.
2243000	2246840	And that's for people who don't know the text that was featured in the Daily Mail article.
2246840	2248360	That basically says, leave me out of this.
2248360	2253000	That was when I had members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asking me to have some
2253000	2260360	and to message one of them that I was still in contact with, seeing if he could tell anything
2260360	2263320	anonymously to them, which they already know who he is.
2263320	2269000	I've already provided everybody the names to these guys among the Pentagon Arrow.
2269000	2270000	They all have that.
2270280	2273720	Do you know if they've been contacted by Senate Intelligence Committee or any of these?
2273720	2278960	Not that I'm aware, because I'm pretty sure I would have gotten probably yelled at or
2278960	2281160	fuck you or something.
2281160	2286880	So you guys get picked up by the CH-53 Superstarion, returned to the USS Denver.
2286880	2291040	How long, what would you say the time elapsed was from the second you were in the Chow Hall
2291040	2293520	approached by the major to returning to the ship?
2293520	2296440	Well, we didn't get approached by the major when there was in the Chow Hall.
2296440	2298160	It was other Marines, other people.
2298160	2301080	I don't remember specifically how that happened.
2301080	2302080	So who called the volunteers?
2302080	2303320	She wasn't gathering everybody up.
2303320	2305720	These were higher up.
2305720	2307920	It could have been staff sergeants or sergeants or something.
2307920	2311840	It says, hey, you guys want to come with this?
2311840	2316840	So whoever was at that point, you're going to meet in the ward room at this time.
2316840	2318680	And I don't remember the specifics of the time.
2318680	2320160	I don't remember who told us.
2320160	2321720	I mean, that's just so long ago.
2321720	2323760	Yeah, but it's just helpful to kind of understand the context.
2323760	2328200	It wasn't anybody in my typical chain of command, which was, you know, because obviously
2328200	2330960	they were kind of more the, hey, you guys are needed for this.
2330960	2335000	And these were just mission volunteers, not hand selected, like strong operatives or anything
2335000	2336000	like that?
2336000	2337400	No, they just randomly put us in sticks.
2337400	2340200	That's all I remember them kind of organizing.
2340200	2342800	You're in this stick, you guys are in this stick.
2342800	2346520	So it wasn't like it was something that was very well planned or based off your skill
2346520	2349120	set or what chain of command or whatever this was.
2349120	2350120	Yeah.
2350120	2356480	So like, I think we can kind of go chronologically through like your experience in Indonesia.
2356480	2359480	So like the first thing I'm wondering is like, what, what did the typical day look
2359480	2361320	like for you on the Denver?
2361320	2362320	On the ship?
2362320	2363320	Yeah.
2363320	2367240	Like when you were, when you were like en route to Indonesia, like I know you were assigned
2367240	2372000	to the officer's chow, like what would kind of a typical day look like for you just like
2372000	2373480	on the ship?
2373480	2378400	So typically, if I can recall this accurately, I mean, because every day blends together in
2378400	2379400	this.
2379400	2380400	Yeah.
2380400	2382400	Plus it was like 15 years ago at this point.
2382400	2386400	So I mean, you typically go to have Reveley, everybody would get up, but obviously we'd
2386400	2390800	get up early because we were either helping with breakfast and having to serve up that
2390800	2395480	and at least, you know, which there's, it's not like we were just serving food because
2395480	2396480	we didn't do that.
2396480	2401960	We were just more, I think, trying to set stuff up, try to clean stuffs, you know.
2401960	2407480	So the cooks actually took actual good care of their job because they're working for the
2407480	2409280	officers, which is great.
2409280	2411560	So they want to take pride in what they do.
2411560	2415280	We got to eat really good because of it compared to what the other guys got to eat.
2415280	2417360	So that was always good.
2417360	2418360	So breakfast...
2418360	2422920	It's kind of like a full-time job, like that assignment was, was kind of like, you would
2422920	2427360	report for doing officer's chow and it was like an eight-hour shift type of thing?
2427360	2428360	Yeah.
2428360	2429360	Or was it okay?
2429360	2431800	Sometimes they'd cut you like with a break so you could either go, which I went to the
2431800	2437480	gym on ship or I went back and then slept for a bit or whatever it is.
2437480	2442120	So there's always things that you can do because when they task you to work on to that, that's
2442120	2444400	where you're spending your time.
2444400	2450320	So how does it work with, you know, especially for me because like I don't have any, you
2450320	2456240	know, military experience, you know, you have like a chain of command that you're a part
2456240	2458660	of, you know, as a Marine.
2458660	2463440	But I know there's, you know, when you're on the ship, you've described kind of like,
2463440	2465160	it's like a separate chain of command or like...
2465160	2466160	Correct.
2466160	2468880	Because what, who you're reporting to are like the Marines that are in charge of that
2468880	2472720	part of the Marines that are on the ship with logistics.
2472720	2475840	All they basically did was say, hey, your number's been picked, you're going to go over
2475840	2477600	here while you're on ship, which is great.
2477600	2478600	Yeah.
2478600	2479960	Because like I said, we got to have fun doing it.
2479960	2484800	We got to eat better than everybody else, you know, so it was something that I enjoyed
2484800	2488720	doing because I got to eat tuna all the time, I got peanut butter, I got all the good stuff.
2488720	2489720	We got T-bone steaks.
2489720	2492760	Everybody else got the little tiny cuts and we got full T-bones.
2492760	2493760	Yeah.
2493760	2497600	So you would work in child with people that weren't necessarily in your immediate team
2497600	2501040	or platoon, just random people on the ship whose numbers were called for same duty.
2501040	2502040	Correct.
2502040	2503480	I mean, it wasn't really a number basis.
2503480	2509920	They just selected whoever, whatever amount they needed, they've all been told us to,
2509920	2512080	you know, this is what you're going to do.
2512080	2517160	And typically during that, I do remember deploying, at least being forward-deployed
2517160	2523040	to Japan a couple weeks to, I think, a month before the whole main element did because
2523040	2528040	they got us ready and we went on ship before everybody else did too, because we're obviously
2528040	2529200	working this detail.
2529200	2534040	So they have to kind of read you up on things, show you how to do things, and then when the
2534040	2540520	whole thing kicks off, get on ship and everybody's just, you know, so for weeks we were on ship
2540520	2543200	with nobody else in our boarding, which was cool too.
2543200	2548120	So they were trying to figure out where Marines were being assigned to, if that makes sense.
2548120	2553320	Now, so when you got, you know, you spoke about getting briefed in the ward room, that
2553320	2554880	was where you were assigned.
2554880	2557440	So how did that exactly go down?
2557440	2562440	Like were you like in the middle of, you know, working in the kitchen and then you just heard
2562440	2566240	someone call out like, you know, hey, we need some volunteers, was it?
2566240	2567240	I think it was that.
2567240	2569560	I don't remember that part specifically.
2569600	2571840	I just remember the key things.
2571840	2577440	I remember who briefed us, which was a female major, and then they were putting up pictures
2577440	2580400	of Obama when he was a kid, saying there was family members were there.
2580400	2584520	So the things that really stuck out of place, I kind of, what I remember mostly.
2584520	2587840	Now did you, you had actually brought this up earlier.
2587840	2590000	Had you ever seen that woman before?
2590000	2591000	No.
2591000	2593280	Like was she dressed in navy, do you soft blue?
2593280	2596520	She was in, she was in our Mar-Pat Woodlands.
2596520	2597520	Okay.
2597520	2598520	So USMC.
2598520	2599520	Okay.
2599520	2602400	So were there other people who were kind of brought to volunteer with you?
2602400	2606720	Were they in the mess hall with you when the major comes in and is requesting volunteers?
2606720	2610680	Yes, some of them, not all of them, but some of them.
2610680	2614200	And so at this time, like your immediate squad, team leader, the other people you're with,
2614200	2616680	they're doing other duties on the ship.
2616680	2619680	They're doing whatever the unit's doing, typically.
2619680	2621840	So that's how that works.
2621840	2624000	Now we weren't in a combat situation.
2624000	2628800	So that's why that it was a little bit different because it's more relaxed.
2628920	2632320	Now if this was something that was combat oriented, then they really wouldn't pull us
2632320	2636240	off to do anything like this because we'd be training and doing whatever we had to do
2636240	2637240	with our unit.
2637240	2638240	Right.
2638240	2640800	Because I know there's a lot of questions about like team leaders and so forth.
2640800	2645000	So when you're on an active mission with a team leader, you'd be with them like glue,
2645000	2648520	but on ships, you're assigned to your actual duties and so forth.
2648520	2649520	Correct.
2649520	2651880	And it also kind of depends on what details you're doing, obviously.
2651880	2654040	So I mean, it's not like that for everybody.
2654040	2658280	There's people, yeah, you have an acting team leader who's just a guy who fills that billet.
2658280	2662120	He could be somebody else that's not, in our instance, was not in our platoon or squad
2662120	2663120	or anything like that.
2663120	2669560	So what kind of typical check-in would you have to do with any superior while on the
2669560	2670560	ship?
2670560	2674800	So when we would report to that, they'd obviously kind of take roll call, make sure everybody
2674800	2677120	was there and then that's pretty much it.
2677120	2681240	It wasn't, I mean, because really it's not like rocket science, for example.
2681240	2686160	So you know, but it was, you also reported to Navy personnel too because they're the
2686160	2688080	ones that you're typically helping and assisting.
2688080	2689080	They're part of the ship.
2689080	2690080	Correct.
2690080	2692840	So they have more kind of what you would call a higher billet at that point because it's
2692840	2693840	their ship.
2693840	2694840	Yeah.
2694840	2700200	That makes a lot of sense because that's really helpful just from someone who's not military
2700200	2702840	that provides a lot of context.
2702840	2708120	Now so during the actual briefing that you were given about the mission that you were
2708120	2715080	about to partake on, were there other people in the ward room during that briefing or was
2715680	2722680	it, so like there could potentially be bystanders that kind of overheard the mission briefing
2722680	2723680	essentially.
2723680	2728960	So anybody who was in there were some key leaders, but there was also some other NCOs.
2728960	2730880	There were a lot of people I didn't know.
2730880	2737360	So I'm just thinking there could potentially be witnesses that would have seen you, seen
2737360	2738360	the briefing.
2738360	2739360	If they remember.
2739360	2740360	Yeah.
2740360	2741360	I mean, right.
2741360	2746160	You know, I mean, like I said, I don't remember anybody else besides some of the guys, but
2746160	2749920	I just remember the thing that stuck out was a female major because she was beautiful.
2749920	2750920	Yeah.
2750920	2752480	Somebody that's, you know, of course you're on ship.
2752480	2755000	You're like, man, I see a lot of women around.
2755000	2756360	So there was that.
2756360	2760440	And then obviously the whole thing with Obama, you really don't see anything like that.
2760440	2763080	It's not something you're really briefed on most of the time.
2763080	2764480	So I wanted to show this to you.
2764480	2768400	Does this look like what that word would look like?
2768400	2772920	I was trying to find a picture of like the actual Denver.
2772920	2773920	Yeah.
2773920	2774920	That would.
2774920	2778880	That is a different ship, but it's the same, you know, the same class.
2778880	2779880	Yeah.
2779880	2785680	And from what I can recall, because they had a wall where the projector was hitting and
2785680	2786680	that's where they were given.
2786680	2788360	But that's kind of similar, at least from this view.
2788360	2789360	Yeah.
2789360	2792520	I mean, but then again, it looks a lot like other ward rooms that were on other ships
2792520	2793520	that I've been on.
2793520	2797280	Well, just to get a general idea of the size, like for me thinking like half a tier, because
2797280	2799000	a ward room is essentially a cafeteria.
2799000	2800000	Yeah.
2800000	2801000	It's just like a fancy.
2801000	2802000	Smaller because obviously, yeah, correct.
2802000	2803000	Yeah.
2803000	2807480	So it's kind of a more small, intimate kind of setting.
2807480	2808480	Correct.
2808480	2809880	What else can you remember from this briefing?
2809880	2812400	What was the mission operation directive?
2812400	2814120	What was the mission time?
2814120	2818480	I don't remember any of those fine details.
2818480	2822120	Just because one, it's been a long time.
2822120	2829480	But two, the only things I can recall is literally the female major briefing us and then pictures
2829480	2833600	of Obama when he was a kid, his parents, just stuff that really stuck out.
2833600	2834600	Yeah.
2834600	2838160	And I actually found evidence of Obama.
2838160	2843720	He spent a lot of time in Indonesia when he was a child and that's all public knowledge.
2843720	2847160	So it's interesting that they had included that.
2847160	2851840	But I mean, just overall, like in general, what was your understanding of like what you
2851880	2854920	guys were about to go security security security.
2854920	2855920	Yeah.
2855920	2860440	But I think it was there was there was a delivery of supplies, you can go to it to a remote
2860440	2861440	village.
2861440	2865240	You know, there's plenty of evidence that that says that the right helicopter, the heavy
2865240	2869800	lift helicopters, the super stallions on the Denver were specifically going to be tasked
2869800	2876040	to go to remote villages because roads were being blocked off by by landslides and stuff.
2876040	2879200	And so you're saying security for the elderly.
2879200	2880200	Yeah.
2880200	2881200	Yeah.
2881280	2887320	The whole point in this isn't something that just even what that female major was saying,
2887320	2890800	but it's just even the fact that everybody knows that this is the second largest terrorist
2890800	2891800	capital in the world.
2891800	2895880	And very, it's a very Muslim dominant area.
2895880	2896880	You know what I mean?
2896880	2899400	So there's people that typically aren't going to be very friendly of us.
2899400	2902120	And that's kind of the first concerns they were having.
2902120	2903560	Why they did things the way they did.
2903560	2904560	I don't know.
2904560	2905560	I didn't plan it.
2905560	2906960	I wasn't in charge with that.
2906960	2911520	So there's things that even I have questions or it's like, why would you do that?
2911520	2912520	Yeah.
2912520	2916480	And what was the protocol after the briefing where you immediately ordered to go to a armory
2916480	2921040	locker, check out weapons and ammunition and report to the super stallions?
2921040	2924320	So all they told us to do was basically get.
2924320	2930800	So they got all her stuff and we went to the armory to draw what and they already had weapons
2930800	2933320	picked for us because that was a sawgunner.
2933320	2937720	So we don't, they didn't, we're not using a saw for this type of ordeal, you know, because
2937720	2939920	it's not, you're not going into combat.
2939920	2942520	So that's how I remember because I was a sawgunner.
2942520	2945880	I never really was issued an M16.
2945880	2950840	First time I, when I got there, I was actually issued a 203 with an M16A4 and that was with
2950840	2952480	Gulf company.
2952480	2958080	And they said that the reason why they wanted me to do that was because I was the boot and
2958080	2962480	they're looking for the people with the grenade launcher because they know it's a team leader.
2962480	2964520	So meaning that the enemy's going to target you.
2964520	2968600	So which, I mean, it was, it was cool because I'm like, I get to carry a grenade launcher,
2968600	2973480	but then I liked the saw because it's a belt-fed automatic weapon and I like that better.
2973480	2979480	And so naturally being used to them 16, it's stuck because I like having a machine gun.
2979480	2980480	Yeah.
2980480	2981480	Full auto.
2981480	2982480	Yeah.
2982480	2983480	And I eat.
2983480	2987960	So, you know, the whole idea of you providing security, you know, and initially a lot of
2987960	2993360	people would say like, oh, that's baloney, like no one would have weapons on a humanitarian
2993360	2994360	mission.
2994360	2999800	Because really the overall operation was humanitarian relief, deliverance, supplies, and people
2999800	3001720	like, oh, you would never have weapons.
3001720	3007960	But I found Rear Admiral Richard Landolt, who's the Rear Admiral who debriefed you after
3007960	3010320	your mission on the ship.
3010320	3015960	He actually did a sort of like a press conference briefing and I'll just read a part of the
3015960	3018240	quote here.
3018240	3024760	So once the 53s came aboard on the morning of the 9th of October, we put them to work
3024760	3029520	first getting survey teams out to the countryside to see where it would be the best locations
3029520	3034600	to drop the cargo that we want to get there and also to get people in place because when
3034600	3039440	these helicopters start showing up with cargo, the first concern is crowd control, you know,
3039440	3044880	so you don't want people, you know, rushing the helicopters and another little interesting
3044880	3051280	thing that kind of supports this that I found was photographs from the 9th and the 10th
3051280	3059680	of the Indonesian military because there was also Indonesian military doing relief as well.
3059680	3064000	And there's a picture of the helicopter in a whole bunch of locals just like all over
3064000	3066960	the helicopter, just like mobbing it.
3066960	3073160	Totally makes sense that there would be a mission like that to provide security and
3073160	3078880	not to mention we've, you know, at this point, have found numerous photographs of people,
3078880	3081400	of Marines doing exactly that.
3081400	3086480	They had rifles and were, you know, providing security around the helicopters.
3086480	3087480	Right.
3087480	3088480	Well, I mean, security is needed.
3088480	3092520	It's just common sense at that point, you know, as much as people would say in the military
3092520	3095840	or at least in the Marine Corps, common sense is not common virtue, but you still got to
3095840	3099960	protect and have a barrier between everybody else because second largest terrorist capital
3099960	3100960	in the world.
3100960	3104440	There's also desperate people who are desperate to do anything for help.
3104440	3108240	And you have that combination of things that can get pretty tricky.
3108240	3114160	Thankfully, we didn't have that, but thankfully, I would have rather have experienced that
3114160	3116080	compared to what we did experience.
3116080	3117080	Right.
3117080	3118080	Yeah, so.
3118080	3123520	Now, do you remember, do you remember which day you did your mission?
3123520	3125640	I don't recall specifically the day.
3125640	3127960	That's kind of what I'm having trouble with.
3127960	3130080	I don't know if it was the ninth or the 10th.
3130080	3131640	So the ship arrived.
3131640	3135840	So there's a little bit of discrepancy on the exact date and I think it comes down to
3135840	3140400	the time zone of like whatever press organization reported it.
3140400	3145520	But like, for instance, right in this testimony from, from the rear admiral, you know, he
3145520	3147600	says the ninth.
3147600	3152400	So it seems like it was like early morning on the ninth or like late at night on the
3152400	3154400	eighth.
3154400	3158080	So was it like, do you remember it being the very first day that the ship arrived?
3158080	3161320	Oh, so, I mean, we never really went topside.
3161320	3166560	So I don't, you know, we're in the kitchen or in the wardrobe or anything like that working.
3166560	3172840	So I don't remember specifically where the only thing I remember is them turning the
3172840	3176400	phones off because they had these phone banks that you have on ship and they turn it off
3176400	3178520	for about a couple of weeks.
3178520	3181480	And because I was going to call my dad and be like, Hey, we're here, you know, but they
3181480	3183000	didn't want that.
3183000	3186560	So I don't remember specifically the day.
3186560	3192800	I do remember that when we were on foot that it was had to have been somewhere in the early
3192800	3197920	afternoon or probably late morning, that timeframe, I'm not entirely sure.
3197920	3199120	I can't recall that.
3199120	3205240	I wish I could because then I can kind of pinpoint where things may have, we can coordinate
3205240	3206240	it somehow.
3206240	3211400	What, at what point did you realize that you weren't going to have radios?
3211400	3212480	I wasn't a radio guy.
3212480	3213920	So that wasn't, that wasn't my thing.
3213920	3217920	So like wasn't even on your radar to like think, Oh, Oh, do we have radios?
3217920	3218920	Yeah.
3218920	3219920	Cause I'm not used to that.
3219920	3222720	I mean, they trained us on the radios, but it wasn't something that we ever really had.
3222720	3226880	I mean, I wasn't a team leader, a squad leader at that point, you know, so I didn't have
3226880	3227880	access to that.
3227880	3228880	And that wasn't a concern.
3228880	3231480	My concern was just what I was dealing with.
3231480	3236600	So I don't remember radios, you know, and the fact is, is I don't remember seeing anybody
3236600	3237600	have radios.
3237600	3240520	And the thing is, is it's a humanitarian mission.
3240520	3242080	It's not a combat operation.
3242080	3245880	You know, so it's not like you're stepping out, expecting you get into firefights and
3245880	3246880	things like that.
3246880	3247880	Yeah.
3247880	3248880	Just humanitarian.
3248880	3251480	So when you guys were gearing up for the mission, you just thought whoever they designated
3251480	3256200	kind of squad or team leader for this operation, they would have something like that, correct.
3256200	3258160	And I think there's been a lot of confusion about these points.
3258160	3263560	So this mission happened during one of your designated shifts in the chow hall with a
3263560	3266000	team that was not your designated team leader.
3266000	3267000	Okay.
3267000	3268000	Correct.
3268000	3273400	You know, the acting as a team leader, you know, so which happens, you know, in situations
3273400	3275360	like this, at least this is my experience.
3275360	3279320	I can't speak for everybody else, but just with what I personally dealt with, this is
3279320	3280560	how it went for us.
3280560	3286840	Now going back to the rifles, you know, like I said, at this point, I found so much evidence
3286840	3289720	that there were definitely Marines there with rifles.
3289720	3295160	However, there were a lot of photographs of guys basically just providing labor, you know,
3295160	3298080	moving boxes, loading helicopters, things like that.
3298080	3304160	And one thing that was interesting that I learned from multiple platoon members that
3304160	3311800	I had reached out to and spoke to, they told me that there was like this rumor that some
3311800	3317640	of the first Marines that flew in had rifles and they got like chewed out by like an Air
3317640	3323440	Force Colonel and were told to like go back to the ship because it was like bad optics.
3323440	3326920	I'm curious, did you ever hear that rumor?
3326920	3330160	I don't remember ever seeing an Air Force Colonel.
3330160	3331160	Yeah.
3331160	3334080	I remember seeing Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, which everybody knows about that.
3334080	3337460	So but as far as an Air Force Colonel, I don't, I don't understand how an Air Force
3337460	3340760	Colonel would have jurisdiction over that kind of operation anyway.
3340760	3341760	Yeah.
3341760	3344480	He wouldn't be in a role to tell Marines that they have to go back to a ship.
3344480	3345480	That's somebody else.
3345480	3346480	Yeah.
3346480	3351120	I found that, I found that odd as well, but I, you know, I didn't know, you know, not,
3351120	3352120	not knowing anything about it.
3352120	3357520	I didn't understand a Navy Fullbird Captain or a Marine Colonel for that matter.
3357520	3361440	He would have the authority to say something like that because what you're talking about
3361440	3365920	is the money and the resources to get X amount of people from ship to shore.
3365920	3367800	So it's going to just, it's going to cost money.
3367800	3369520	It's just going to not make sense at that point.
3369520	3375320	So you got on the helicopter and you flew to Tobbing Airport, which it's not named
3375320	3379320	that anymore, but you said that you never got off the helicopter at the airport.
3379320	3381160	It was basically just, you know,
3381200	3383320	we landed and that's what I remember too.
3383320	3387640	And this is kind of what I was able to provide people because we'd never gone off.
3387640	3388640	Right.
3388640	3391400	And I can know that basically the direction of when we were flying off the ship that
3391400	3394040	they could see the ocean and they can start to see the land.
3394040	3396920	So it kind of tells you somewhat the direction of where you're heading.
3396920	3401080	All I remember from the airport that we landed on was that there was blue roofs.
3401080	3402080	Yeah.
3402080	3403800	That's the only thing I can indicate out of that.
3403800	3405960	What I'm getting at is it's, it's perfectly plausible.
3405960	3410800	If you guys, you know, didn't get off the helicopters, it's perfectly plausible.
3410800	3415960	You could have landed there and not caused any sort of stir by walking around with rifles
3415960	3417880	because you didn't get out, get off the helicopter.
3417880	3419280	Yeah, we weren't, we didn't.
3419280	3423800	So because I remember that too, because we were sleeping on a helicopter because that's
3423800	3424800	what you do.
3424800	3427280	You know, you get used to in transport everywhere.
3427280	3431240	We did in seven tons of AVs, helicopters, all that fun stuff.
3431240	3435160	So you're just like, I'm just getting a ride and you can fall asleep anywhere at this point.
3435160	3439240	So and it's boring, you know, it's not like it's anything.
3439240	3440240	So it's just humanitarian.
3440240	3443960	You know, we're hoping at that point that there would have been something, but not in
3443960	3449280	the indication of what we experienced, but you know, something outside of that.
3449280	3455120	So when we, because what I do remember vaguely is when we landed on the airstrip and I remember
3455120	3459360	seeing other helicopters basically trailing behind us and land.
3459360	3461880	And then we were sitting there.
3461880	3467200	I don't remember the time or how long we were sitting there, but I remember then us taking
3467200	3468200	off.
3469160	3470160	It's 53.
3470160	3471160	Okay.
3471160	3473600	There may have been some 46 is two.
3473600	3478880	I'm not entirely sure, but I only remember the Denver and I only remember being on a
3478880	3479880	CH 53.
3479880	3482760	I don't remember any kind of other helicopters that were on that deck.
3482760	3483760	Yeah.
3483760	3487000	I never really spent much time topside.
3487000	3492080	The only reason I bring that up is it's, I'm wondering if those were the same helicopters
3492080	3495840	that ended up following you guys to the LZ, you know, because I know you had said that
3495840	3502440	there were other helicopters because they're, that could be plausible as far as I know.
3502440	3506400	The Super Stallions were only the ones that came on the Denver.
3506400	3508040	Like there weren't any additional Super.
3508040	3509040	Yeah.
3509040	3511480	I don't, I don't remember, you know, I don't remember any of that.
3511480	3512480	Right.
3512480	3516840	I mean, there's been plenty of ships that have been on where I remember seeing 46s, which
3516840	3519840	are the dual, the egg beaters, if you will.
3519840	3523960	I remember seeing plenty of those, you know, but as far as the Denver, I don't really recall
3523960	3524960	that.
3525080	3526080	And I could have not been.
3526080	3527080	Yeah.
3527080	3528080	I just don't know.
3528080	3534680	Even if your mission happened after the point where those guys supposedly got yelled at
3534680	3538800	for bringing rifles, like it's plausible that you could have had your mission even after
3538800	3544160	that point and just slip by on notice because you didn't get off the helicopter, you know.
3544160	3552680	So the flight to the LZ described the view that you have outside the back of the helicopter.
3552680	3558600	So coming from the airport, I can remember just looking at the ocean and then we were
3558600	3565800	getting, I remember seeing some very heavy vegetation and kind of like hills, wasn't
3565800	3568320	like flat with trees or bushes or anything.
3568320	3573680	It was like getting thicker and was, I remember seeing some hills, not from the helicopter,
3573680	3577400	but because when you get off the bird, they have one area where you can't go because you
3577400	3581280	have this big tail rotor and you don't want to run underneath the thing.
3581280	3584960	So they always say either I think is go to the right or the left, I can't remember.
3584960	3589880	But whatever the, whatever side that tail rotor is not on is where you're egressing
3589880	3590880	the helicopter.
3590880	3596600	And then basically you would form a 360 around the helicopter to provide that security and
3596600	3599080	then it'd take off.
3599080	3603760	And then you basically would get into formation and you'd patrol out from there.
3603760	3610480	I don't really recall when I got off the helicopter what I really saw at that point.
3610480	3614440	I do remember seeing some hills and remember seeing some big, thick vegetation.
3614440	3619720	I don't remember if I saw any villagers or other personnel or people there.
3619720	3624800	Backing up just a step, like when you guys were at the airport, were there any supplies
3624800	3626440	loaded on the helicopter?
3626440	3631080	So this was strictly a personnel transport and were there any other people on the helicopter
3631080	3633600	that were being taken to the LZ or was it just us?
3633600	3634600	It was just us.
3634600	3639400	And then you have the crew chief and you have some other crew support and then the pilots
3639400	3640400	obviously.
3641320	3645760	I don't really, I only recall one crew chief who's just basically walking up and down watching
3645760	3646920	everybody doing their job.
3646920	3649400	I don't remember anybody else.
3649400	3655040	I just remember just one guy and I don't remember seeing any kind of boxes or stuff
3655040	3656040	that they would store in there.
3656040	3658800	And obviously we didn't have anything on the bottom because how are you going to land at
3658800	3660600	the airport when you have something underneath?
3660600	3661600	Yeah.
3661600	3666680	Like a cargo hook type of thing, which some of the helicopters were transporting stuff
3666680	3667680	that way.
3667960	3672400	You landed at the LZ, you describe it as a hasty LZ.
3672400	3673400	Yeah.
3673400	3679400	Now, I've come to learn that's like a technical term, that means something very specific.
3679400	3684600	Are you using it in that way or what does that mean for someone who doesn't know?
3684600	3686720	Hasty is kind of like off the hip.
3686720	3688520	It's not something very thought out.
3688520	3691760	It's just like, okay, where can we, okay, right there looks good.
3691760	3692760	Right?
3692760	3695640	And that's maybe what they were thinking as far as the pilots are concerned.
3695640	3699760	I don't know, but maybe they had it designated, but it just seemed to me because we were kind
3699760	3702360	of the first ones there that it'd be hasty in my opinion.
3702360	3705720	But then when everything else is set up, some other Marines that probably come in were like,
3705720	3706720	okay, this is secured.
3706720	3707720	It's something set up.
3707720	3710200	It may not be a hasty LZ at that point.
3710200	3713080	But when we approached it, I just remember not really seeing anybody there.
3713080	3715320	So it's kind of like, okay, we'll.
3715320	3718480	So there was no, so there weren't, there wasn't anyone at the LZ when you landed?
3718480	3719480	Yeah.
3719480	3720840	I don't recall that.
3720840	3724640	There could have been some bystanders off to the, off in the distance that maybe saw
3724640	3729840	the attention or saw what was going on that decided to come up at a later point.
3729840	3732720	But yeah, as far as arriving there, I don't remember seeing anybody.
3732720	3737080	So you guys step off the CH-53, your primary objective is to provide security.
3737080	3738640	What do you guys do right when you step off the helicopter?
3738640	3744040	Well, we saw this opportunity to take the slope because we have visual around everything.
3744040	3748080	It allows us to basically act within that protocol, right?
3748080	3751880	As being in a tactical advantage of being in an elevated position is where you want
3751880	3752880	to be.
3752880	3755160	And that's what, you know, that wasn't the one that made the decision.
3755160	3758360	The guy that was in charge of us was the one that made that decision.
3758360	3764440	You know, it wasn't terribly too far in comparison, but at the same point, when you have visual
3764440	3770880	of that and you're also watching some other stuff happen, I remember really seeing one
3770880	3775080	helicopter that actually had the cargo net on the bottom that was flown in, dropped it
3775080	3777520	off and then it banked off to the right.
3777520	3784640	What I'm curious is like, what was your initial impression when you got off the helicopter,
3784640	3791760	like in comparison to your briefing, like your expectations that were set by the briefing,
3791760	3797600	and then the reality of you getting off this helicopter and you're there, first of all,
3797600	3799320	you said the helicopter left, right?
3799320	3802600	Like it dropped you guys off, it's gone.
3802600	3806720	You guys have no radio, there's really no one around.
3806720	3808760	You guys are the only people there.
3808760	3815760	So like, can you remember, like, was there an adjustment to your expectations of like
3815760	3818680	the reality of the situation versus what you were expecting?
3818680	3822200	Honestly, I thought it was more like, hey, we're not doing shit with this.
3822200	3823200	Yeah.
3823200	3826840	It's like it's just going to be boring to standing around looking at people like, you
3826840	3830520	know, and that's why I had a video camera when I was taking pictures and video because
3830520	3834200	I remember getting the one helicopter that dropped off something on video and I remember
3834200	3839320	getting it and needless to say, it wasn't at the point where we, you know, because we
3839320	3841040	were conditioned three with our weapons.
3841040	3843320	It wasn't like it was chambered around or nothing.
3843320	3848920	We just had a magazine inserted, safety was on, the bolt was all the way forward, weapon
3848920	3853560	was on safe and the ejection port cover was closed as it states in the condition rules,
3853560	3854640	right?
3854640	3857720	So I thought it was just, oh yeah, we're just going to be standing around.
3857720	3861520	This is just going to be kind of boring, you know, even trying to help out with boxes or
3861520	3865280	something probably would have been more helpful in comparison here because you're actually
3865280	3866280	doing something.
3866280	3867280	Yeah.
3867280	3868280	Right.
3868280	3869280	So, you know.
3869280	3870280	That lines up perfect.
3870280	3874560	Like every single person I've talked to who was on this operation, you know, doing different
3874560	3879960	missions on the operation described the same situation where they felt it was like boring.
3879960	3883200	It was like an excuse to get off the ship.
3883200	3886520	You know, obviously you're doing a good deed and you, and you know, it's, it's a good experience
3886520	3891320	from that perspective, but it's interesting to hear that because I think a lot of people
3891320	3895160	have this misconception that this was like, you know, because you had mentioned that,
3895160	3899400	oh, you know, you were notified there were terrorists in the, in the location that you
3899400	3901320	guys were like super on alert.
3901320	3906920	Like this was like, you were ready to engage an enemy and, and you know, that sort of thing.
3906920	3907920	Nothing like that.
3907920	3910320	Were you surprised when the helicopter took off?
3910320	3911320	Yeah.
3911320	3912320	Okay.
3912320	3916280	And did you have any sort of estimated timeframe when it was to return or the mission duration?
3916280	3918000	I have no clue about that.
3918000	3924080	You guys are, I suppose the squad leader decided that you guys should go up to the top of the
3924080	3925080	hill, right?
3925080	3930080	And you know what, it makes sense because we were out in the open and you don't necessarily
3930080	3933600	want to be out in the open if you've got no support at that end.
3933600	3937080	So where we were at was kind of hidden and you kind of get in the vegetation a little
3937080	3938080	bit more.
3938080	3942440	So I can kind of understand why he would say, let's go ahead and push up this direction.
3942440	3946800	Now you've mentioned a second helicopter flying in.
3946800	3951480	You had your camera, you know, you, you took some pictures of that helicopter coming in.
3951480	3957240	But did you, I almost remember you saying that it, it didn't fly to the same landing
3957240	3959760	point that your helicopter did.
3959760	3960760	It landed somewhere.
3960760	3961760	Off in the distance.
3961760	3962760	Yeah.
3962760	3963760	A little bit further away.
3963760	3967760	So that makes me wonder kind of how big was the LZ essentially?
3967760	3969760	Like was it was kind of just like an open area?
3969760	3972880	Was it just like a, no, no, it was, it was pretty open.
3972880	3976200	I remember it kind of being open, but that's where I remember the hills and stuff because
3976320	3979680	there was like an open area with thick, tall grass, right?
3979680	3983840	And it was kind of, I would assume muddy because it's a tropical terrain, obviously.
3983840	3988440	It wasn't like we were on a dirt road or something that was already, you know, cleared
3988440	3991120	out to be used as transportation.
3991120	3994960	So I think it was just more in a sense that there's a clear area over here.
3994960	3999240	And obviously there was, they probably, the second helicopter probably saw other people
3999240	4002760	that were probably close to that area and assumed that those are the people.
4002800	4005080	For us, we were off in the distance.
4005080	4007560	So whether or not he could see us at that point, I don't know.
4007560	4011920	I assume he wouldn't be able to, but because where we were at, I mean, there's trees, you
4011920	4012920	know.
4012920	4013920	Yeah.
4013920	4018120	So you didn't see any sort of like preparation to the LZ, like they didn't cut down trees
4018120	4019120	ahead of time.
4019120	4020120	You didn't see any red tape.
4020120	4025920	Cause I've seen some photographs of other LZs that showed like red tape kind of closing
4025920	4026920	off the area.
4026920	4027920	Yeah.
4027920	4029680	I don't remember any red tape or seeing that kind of stuff.
4029680	4030680	So.
4030680	4031680	Right.
4031680	4035000	So what the time elapsed was from the second you left the chow hall to returning to the
4035000	4036000	Denver.
4036000	4037000	I had it been a couple hours.
4037000	4038000	Okay.
4038000	4039000	Had it been a couple hours.
4039000	4040000	But not like a full day.
4040000	4041000	No, it was not a full day.
4041000	4042000	It had to have been a couple hours.
4042000	4043000	It was nothing.
4043000	4047400	Something that could have taken place within the span of a chow hall shift.
4047400	4048400	Like the time you'd spend working.
4048400	4049400	Probably more than that too.
4049400	4050400	Okay.
4050400	4055120	You know, because it had to be a couple hours, man, you know, it wasn't, wasn't like an all
4055120	4056120	day thing.
4056120	4057120	Okay.
4057120	4058120	Thankfully.
4058120	4061400	You know what I forgot to ask is the, what was the weather like at the LZ?
4061920	4062920	Sunny.
4062920	4063920	Yeah.
4063920	4064920	Yep.
4064920	4065920	Sunny.
4065920	4066920	I remember, I remember because it was hot.
4066920	4067920	I mean, it was hot.
4067920	4071040	Regardless of, I guess, if there, even if there was cloud cover, it still would be hot because
4071040	4072400	it's tropical.
4072400	4079840	I don't remember really, I don't remember actually looking up at the sky to see if there were
4079840	4081240	clouds or if it was sunny.
4081240	4086320	I just remember it being hot, assuming it was sunny.
4086320	4090400	And so when you get back to the Denver, how does it work?
4090400	4093840	Like, you know, you have your rifle, you have to like go back to the armory or something.
4093840	4096560	We dropped everything off there, given the magazines.
4096560	4097560	Wasn't my magazines.
4097560	4098560	It was somebody else's.
4098560	4100560	What do you mean by that?
4100560	4103560	Well, there's the armor that gave us those magazines that were full.
4103560	4104560	Because you were saw.
4104560	4105920	So you had your own weapon assigned.
4105920	4106920	Yep.
4106920	4112240	I had my own magazines, but actually remember if I actually had those on my vest too, or
4112240	4118480	if I were to left them locked up or in a typically had those in my assault pack, which I didn't
4118480	4126720	bring an assault pack with me, trying to think, remember, yeah, it was somebody else's magazines,
4126720	4127720	for sure.
4127720	4128720	So it wasn't mine.
4128720	4132400	Because this was a loner M16, loner magazines from assigned to a different soldier.
4132400	4139440	People compare you to like the like the Dodie and Benowitz story, and I'm like, that's completely
4139440	4146160	different because Benowitz didn't have this like a undeniable experience where he saw
4146160	4147160	an anti-radio.
4147160	4148160	Correct.
4149160	4153800	Yeah, radio communications and he speculated that it could be ET and Dodie just egged
4153800	4154800	that on.
4154800	4155800	Correct.
4155800	4156800	Yeah.
4156800	4157800	This is totally different.
4157800	4158800	And this is coming from Dodie himself.
4158800	4159800	I asked him kind of what that whole thing was.
4159800	4160800	Yeah.
4160800	4164240	He said, yeah, well, somebody said they heard something, Paul, and this is what I was told
4164240	4165240	to do.
4165240	4166240	Right.
4166240	4167240	That's what he said.
4167240	4170120	So I mean, like it makes, it just logically makes no sense.
4170120	4176280	Like if you were making this up, if a disinfo agent were to come and like, be like, yeah,
4176280	4179160	I know about your operation that you stumbled upon.
4179160	4180160	Yeah.
4180160	4182400	It's like, if you made it up, you would know that he's lying.
4182400	4183400	Well, exactly.
4183400	4187080	Because how could he tell you that he knows about operations and stuff if it was made
4187080	4188080	up?
4188080	4189600	Like it just doesn't make any sense.
4189600	4190600	No.
4190600	4193800	I mean, I wish it was made up because then I wouldn't have to have been going through
4193800	4199440	losing my fucking hair and having the, you know, sleepless nights and literally just,
4199440	4202280	I wouldn't be in the uncomfortable position I would be in.
4202280	4203280	Yeah.
4203280	4204640	And it's not fun being in this position.
4204640	4205640	It really isn't.
4205640	4209240	I mean, that's why I tell people, especially, I'm not encouraging my guys to come forward
4209240	4213360	and let's say if this thing blows hope and then all of a sudden everything is able to
4213360	4219760	be proven true, and let's just say these insiders at some point ever do, or some information
4219760	4224240	comes out that's physical that literally no shit can prove everything, then maybe they
4224240	4225240	would.
4225240	4226240	I don't know.
4226240	4227240	Yeah.
4227240	4228240	But it put them in a different position.
4228240	4231800	But right now, I mean, even for myself, they know that I'm uncomfortable and they kind
4231800	4234640	of like, well, it's your fucking fault.
4234640	4235640	I don't blame them.
4235640	4239560	I mean, but if I didn't see what I saw and somebody else from a different perspective
4239560	4242560	was telling this story, I don't know how I would react to that.
4242560	4244920	Probably, I probably wouldn't believe it.
4244920	4248800	I'd probably be, but that's the only thing is before any of this happened, I was not
4248800	4250840	somebody who believed in this shit.
4250840	4254440	I was somebody who was like, okay, well, this guy's out of his fucking mind or, you know,
4254440	4258080	well, you got, so you're, let me guess, you're in Mississippi and you're fishing and you
4258080	4261160	saw a fucking craft and you saw a fucking graze.
4261160	4262400	Okay.
4262400	4264920	What episode of X Files are you talking about?
4264920	4266400	That's how I would think of it.
4266400	4271920	But then having my experience is just like, if I experienced this, okay, maybe there
4271920	4273560	might be some validity to what they're saying.
4273560	4274560	I don't know.
4274560	4278560	I wasn't there, but I know based off of being in my shoes, it's like, it's hard to say somebody
4278560	4283520	else is not true or to try to point out the flaws or anything like that.
4283520	4285920	I know what it's like to be in somebody's shoes like that.
4285920	4287440	Granted, I didn't see ETs.
4287440	4290920	I saw operators and I saw it was clearly man-made.
4290920	4294560	It was, didn't do shit on a normal helicopter or plane did.
4294560	4295560	I can tell you that.
4295560	4296560	Right.
4296560	4301360	I mean, it's like an unmistakable experience like it's not like something you saw at a
4301360	4302360	distance.
4302360	4303360	I was like, oh, that looks weird.
4303360	4304360	Like this thing's right here.
4304360	4305360	Yep.
4305360	4306360	You see it.
4306360	4307360	It's huge.
4307360	4308360	We're close enough to hear it.
4308360	4309360	Yeah.
4309360	4310360	You know, right.
4310360	4311360	That's kind of the point.
4311360	4312360	And you saw it fly off.
4312360	4313360	Yep.
4313360	4314360	I mean, it's like, didn't have a rotor.
4314360	4315360	It wasn't like a helicopter.
4315360	4316360	It wasn't a plane.
4316360	4317360	Yeah.
4317360	4319440	And no rotor wash on the vegetation.
4319440	4320440	Nothing.
4320960	4324040	It was like it was isolated in itself.
4324040	4326000	Like it didn't disturb any of the environment.
4326000	4328080	It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
4328080	4332680	And I wanted to be a fighter pilot and I knew pretty much what kind of aircraft we had at
4332680	4337600	our disposal as a Marine Corps and especially the Air Force only has a certain amount of
4337600	4340560	planes they're using, helicopters, same thing.
4340560	4342400	There's only so many.
4342400	4346360	This obviously was an Indonesian military equipment.
4346360	4351000	I don't remember anybody come and saying, hey, yeah, Indonesian military has something
4351000	4355280	that's sophisticated or Chinese or Japanese or for that matter.
4355280	4356280	Right.
4356280	4357280	You know.
4357280	4358280	Yeah.
4358280	4362240	I find it interesting to, you know, you testified to Arrow and like I noticed in the historical
4362240	4370200	report, you know, they emphasize like belief and like, you know, basically trying to say,
4370200	4374520	you know, people might believe what they saw or anything, but we can't prove that they're
4374520	4375520	lying.
4375520	4382320	And I'm like, what you're describing is an unmistakable testimony.
4382320	4386120	There's no, it's not like you could say like, oh, well, maybe he believes that's what he
4386120	4388280	saw, but maybe it was something different.
4388280	4389280	I know what I said.
4389280	4393360	There's no way it was, you know, some normal thing.
4393360	4397520	If anybody was to have seen this, they would remember this for the rest of their lives.
4397520	4400200	It's so distinct because this never happens.
4400200	4401200	Right.
4401200	4402200	It's stumbling.
4402200	4404560	I mean, in some ways people think, oh, it's stumbling on the goal.
4404560	4405560	No, it's really not.
4405560	4411520	But in some cases of saying that, yes, we have this technology because there's human involvement,
4411520	4412520	obviously.
4412520	4415720	It's not like there's an ETs and they're floating, flying in this damn thing.
4415720	4419000	And there's just operators who just choose to be there.
4419000	4422840	I mean, it's completely manmade.
4422840	4427320	And with the human involvement just tells me, okay, well, manmade human involvement means
4427320	4430560	it's some group has it.
4430560	4433820	Now I know who it is to an extent.
4433820	4436600	And speaking of Aero, I really wanted to kind of fast forward to when you talked to him
4436600	4438320	in April of 2023.
4438320	4439320	What was that like?
4439320	4443000	Well, like an interrogation to an extent.
4443000	4447280	And so you spoke directly to Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, right?
4447280	4450120	He's the only one that I can confirm that yes, I talked to.
4450120	4455240	I know the other gentleman, but what I signed stating that I was not allowed to divulge
4455240	4458920	where we met at or who was also there.
4458920	4461120	But Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the interview.
4461120	4462600	And I think he was in everybody's interview.
4462600	4464320	I'll have to ask other whistleblowers.
4464320	4467720	I personally know if he was sitting in there with them, but he was there.
4467720	4471600	What was his demeanor like when you were speaking to him?
4471600	4472960	Not really interested.
4472960	4474720	Everybody else was taking notes.
4474720	4479240	He was more interested in the fact of, because he only asked three questions and the three
4479240	4481360	questions were all the same.
4481360	4484160	It was who were these operators?
4484160	4485800	I already stated once, I don't know.
4485800	4487040	I'm not going to know the second time.
4487040	4488560	I'm not going to know the third time.
4488560	4495520	I know a little bit now of what group they're a part of and what their backgrounds may be.
4495520	4497880	But I don't know who they directly are.
4497880	4502240	And if it was any of the people that I've been talking and working with, I would remember
4502240	4504240	who they are based off their faces.
4504240	4505920	And none of them are those guys.
4505920	4509400	When you testified to him, did Dr. Kirkpatrick say he'd follow up?
4509400	4510760	Did he say what was going to happen next?
4510760	4511760	Oh, yeah.
4511760	4512760	We'll follow up on it.
4512760	4517840	Because I had asked them if they could get the satellite imagery of that day and they
4517840	4520880	said they had access to that.
4520880	4526680	It's been more than a year and they have yet to have anybody contact me from Arrow saying
4526680	4528200	that, yes, we have the imagery.
4528200	4529520	Where can you point out?
4529520	4533520	Because compared to 14, 15 years ago, it's going to look different.
4533520	4534800	Maybe they expanded the city.
4534800	4537040	There's things that vegetation have grown.
4537040	4541880	There's any numerous things that could have happened between at that point to now.
4541880	4546360	And how did you feel when the historical report volume one came out that was a complete
4546360	4550480	misprint lie of your testimony stating you saw an extraterrestrial vehicle?
4550480	4551480	Correct.
4551480	4552480	I didn't say extraterrestrial.
4552480	4555680	And I didn't say there were US special forces.
4555680	4558000	None of that came out of my mouth.
4558000	4562520	And you got to think that that's a purposeful omission to say those things because that's
4562520	4564000	blatantly false.
4564000	4565000	Correct.
4565000	4569640	I've stated in every single interview and even in the National Press Club and even with
4569640	4574480	some gentlemen that I've still in touch with who was in the skiff with me, he for one knows
4574480	4578120	I never said anything like that because he was sitting right here when I was talking
4578120	4581160	to Kirk Patrick among others.
4581160	4585320	So I was pretty upset at the fact, but you can't really be upset because you already
4585320	4588920	kind of expected them to do something like this and that's just what they do.
4588920	4594920	Was there, because I think some of the people who testified to Arrow, there was a written
4594920	4598880	memorandum for record of their testimony.
4598960	4601880	Do you know if there was any written record of what you told them?
4601880	4602880	I don't remember that either.
4602880	4606000	I remember them taking notes and handwriting everything trying to get the details.
4606000	4609880	But I think it was something that the witness would sign.
4609880	4613400	They would read over it like, okay, yeah, this is what my testimony, they would sign
4613400	4618840	it for record to be like, this is my testimony that I provided to Arrow.
4618840	4621960	I signed several documents.
4621960	4622960	That could have been one of them.
4622960	4624040	I don't recall that.
4624040	4629000	I remember saying a nondisclosure saying that I would not talk about who specifically
4629000	4632880	was there besides Dr. K already admitting that he was in our interviews.
4632880	4634200	So that's easy.
4634200	4635360	The other gentleman, I can't.
4635360	4639600	And then the location, I can't talk about that.
4639600	4642080	That's legal binding because it's not anything illegal.
4642080	4644520	So I have to respect that.
4644520	4646840	What other memorandums have you seen for the Arrow?
4646840	4652440	Because I've only seen Eric Tabers, who of course is a second hand kind of commenter.
4652440	4661560	Well, I think there was something that was FOIA release from the Black Vault that I had
4661560	4669360	recognized was a direct, it was the same exact form that you had shown me.
4669360	4670360	So I had recognized that.
4670360	4673160	And that was provided for me to look over before making that trip.
4673160	4676560	Prior to, yeah, it wasn't like the actual one you signed, but it was kind of a review.
4676560	4679600	Yeah, because there were screenshots of this gentleman's cell phone that he sent me who's
4679600	4680600	involved with that.
4680880	4683960	Did you watch his interviews with Steven Greenstreet?
4683960	4684960	It'll just piss you off.
4684960	4688640	I don't watch any of his shit, dude, because I just know it's all bullfucking lies.
4688640	4692640	There was supposed to be a second piece that completely got moved.
4692640	4696640	You know what would get people's views if they, hey, Sean, go ahead and come on to this
4696640	4697640	podcast.
4697640	4699640	Here's the whistleblowers.
4699640	4702560	Hey, buddy, how's it going?
4702560	4703560	Haven't seen you in a while.
4703560	4705720	Thanks for being a fucking dick.
4705720	4706720	He would never.
4706720	4707720	He said he would.
4707840	4708840	Guess what?
4708840	4710960	I can contradict the shit that he's talking about.
4710960	4711960	So can other people.
4711960	4716120	He said he wouldn't do any more media appearances after getting caught at a 2018 skinlocker ranch
4716120	4717120	briefing.
4717120	4718120	He's live.
4718120	4721880	Well, Brandon actually had posted that.
4721880	4722880	Because he did the same thing.
4722880	4724280	I didn't talk to him about this.
4724280	4725280	I wasn't at this meeting.
4725280	4728320	And then Brandon just posted the picture on Twitter.
4728320	4731320	I remember I hit Brandon up at that point.
4731320	4732320	Yeah.
4732320	4741280	What I actually kind of find funny is, so Nathan came forward.
4741280	4748840	Your team leader claims that you're making this all up.
4748840	4755360	First of all, it's like, so he was unvetted with Patrick.
4755360	4760520	It was framed as if he was in a position.
4760520	4766080	There's no situation where Nathan would have seen the UFO because from your testimony,
4766080	4769560	he wasn't part of your squad that was there.
4769560	4771680	So he wouldn't have seen the UFO, right?
4771680	4772680	Not at all.
4772680	4773680	Yeah.
4773680	4779240	So for him to be like, yeah, we were on this mission, but we didn't see the UFO doesn't
4779240	4780240	make sense.
4780240	4783720	Because whatever mission he did, obviously he didn't see the UFO.
4783720	4785840	No, and that wasn't on the same one with him.
4785840	4786840	Exactly.
4786840	4788520	Nor was this a secret night mission.
4788520	4789520	No, it was not.
4789520	4791560	It was a secret, and it did not involve aliens.
4791560	4792840	Not at all.
4792840	4795680	I never spoke seeing ETs, guys.
4795680	4799640	That's kind of why this is boring in comparison to other people's stuff.
4799640	4800880	But no, it was not a night mission.
4800880	4802960	That would have sucked if it had been our night.
4802960	4804800	We didn't have night vision with us.
4804800	4808040	My Kevlar, and I didn't even have a Rhino mount to mount anything because I always kept
4808040	4812240	that off because it just get in the way during the daytime.
4812400	4826480	Quickly I had, on my Kevlar I usually had goggles that were clear lenses.
4826480	4830040	Most of the time it was just easy to pop those off and put them on just because, you know,
4830040	4834760	I didn't like having darks because they just really fucked with my vision and just, I hated
4834760	4835760	it.
4835760	4840040	And not only that, but these were ESS and they fogged up like you wouldn't believe.
4840160	4843360	At least clears are easier to deal with that as opposed to the dark lenses.
4843360	4845520	But yeah, Nathan wasn't with me.
4845520	4849440	Yeah, and I mean, so like one thing that I find kind of funny, like when you think about
4849440	4853800	it, you know, if, you know, he's saying you made this all up.
4853800	4859760	And so if that's the case, it means not only did you decide to make up a story about UFOs,
4859760	4863840	but you decided the actual mission I went on with Nathan, I'm going to pretend that
4863840	4866600	didn't happen too, which makes no sense whatsoever.
4867600	4877240	And I mean, really the only thing that makes Nathan's testimony have any weight whatsoever
4877240	4880920	is simply the fact that you're denying that you were ever on a mission with him because
4880920	4883880	you could have very easily have just said, yeah, I did two missions.
4883880	4885480	I did one with him and I had this other one.
4885480	4886480	Yeah, I didn't do two missions.
4886480	4892360	So it's like, it's just like anyone with half a brain would like know that, you know, if
4892360	4896560	you were making this all up, just say, yeah, I went on this real mission with Nathan.
4896560	4899360	Well, yeah, it could easily have said something like that.
4899360	4904800	If that was really the case, if I wanted to lie about you, but then obviously the insiders
4904800	4905800	wouldn't exist.
4905800	4910040	And you know, well, that's the biggest thing for me is like, why would this insider be
4910040	4911040	approaching?
4911040	4912040	And it's just not one guy.
4912040	4913040	It's multiple.
4913040	4914040	You know what I mean?
4914040	4918480	So why would they spend any time to try to help me if I was lying to anybody?
4918480	4923980	Why would they expose themselves and their parts of it in details that I personally know?
4923980	4925800	They wouldn't take that chance.
4926160	4930400	They're already, their butts already puckered up just like mine compared because obviously
4930400	4935320	what they're having to deal with personally, they wouldn't subject themselves to going
4935320	4936680	to somebody who's lying.
4936680	4939360	It doesn't make any sense.
4939360	4947040	But so Nathan, the thing that's most compelling about Nathan is, you know, he is who he says
4947040	4948040	he is.
4948040	4949040	Correct.
4949040	4950040	You know, he was your team leader.
4950040	4951040	At one point, yes.
4952040	4953600	He was on that operation.
4953600	4954600	He was on the ship.
4954600	4956880	All of that stuff logically lines up.
4956880	4961560	And he has this photograph of two people on a helicopter.
4961560	4964440	He says one of them is you.
4964440	4965440	You've denied that.
4965440	4966440	You said it's not you.
4966440	4967440	Correct.
4967440	4968440	I know who it is.
4968440	4969440	I'm not going to say who it is, but I know who it is.
4969440	4970440	Yeah.
4970440	4978800	So the thing, the thing that's interesting though is someone found a match in the camouflage
4978800	4982840	between that photo and another photo of you.
4982840	4984520	Is it the Daily Mail photo?
4984520	4985520	Yeah.
4985520	4986520	Yeah.
4986520	4989800	Because there's only two photos that I know that have been released.
4989800	4994200	One of them was when I sent to Josh Bosworth with Daily Mail because they're like, hey,
4994200	4995640	do you have any pictures you want to?
4995640	4996640	Yeah.
4996640	4998520	I believe it's you helmet on holding the saw.
4998520	4999520	Correct.
4999520	5000520	So yes.
5000520	5001720	And I mean, but here's the thing.
5001720	5003160	It's a medium rag that I was wearing.
5003160	5005480	A lot of them are the same patterns of that way.
5005480	5009360	It's not like it's a fingerprint of one specific thing.
5009360	5012080	I mean, it's odd that it's in the same location.
5012080	5017080	Like I know like some of the patterns repeat and that you can find examples of this all
5017080	5022320	over of finding like the pattern, you know, on a leg here and then on a different uniform.
5022320	5024640	Like it'll be on like the other leg or whatever.
5024640	5025640	Right.
5025640	5028200	And but it's like some of the patterns don't even look identical.
5028200	5029200	Just a minor pain.
5029200	5030200	Yeah.
5030200	5031200	You know, that's just where we're at.
5031920	5037560	So you don't think there's any possibility that like it was it was a picture of you on
5037560	5038560	a different day?
5038560	5040040	No, that was not me.
5040040	5043120	It just simply facial structure doesn't look the same as mine.
5043120	5044120	Yeah.
5044120	5045120	It's not even me.
5045120	5048320	I mean, even everybody I've showed that knows me is like, that's not fucking you, dude.
5048320	5049320	Yeah.
5049320	5051440	People text me like this guy saying it's you.
5051440	5052440	That's not you.
5052440	5053440	Yeah.
5053440	5055840	So I mean, if that's what he's got, that's what he's got.
5055840	5056840	That's not me.
5056840	5058720	Right.
5058720	5062920	But his intention with this is I don't know, but they're just, I mean, you guys have a
5062920	5063920	history.
5063920	5066960	I mean, oh, he doesn't like me flat out and the feelings mutual.
5066960	5070920	But the thing is I moved, I got with what I'm dealing with in my life and that's all
5070920	5072080	I'm focused on.
5072080	5073960	I'm not making money off of this stuff.
5073960	5076520	This doesn't get me anywhere financially.
5076520	5080840	What it does provide is understanding and stuff that I wish I never learned, but the
5080840	5084680	truth had to be known and I'm thankful at least these insiders were able to show details
5084680	5090080	and share me details as well of what they were personally dealing with because these
5090080	5092360	guys are working in that organization.
5092360	5093360	Yeah.
5093360	5099640	So let's let's fast forward to that kind of modern day after your whole experience.
5099640	5103520	You don't talk about this for many years.
5103520	5109600	What motivated you to come forward in because you signed an NDA that basically died in your
5109600	5113080	life and correct and all of all of us did sign that.
5113080	5116680	So what motivated you to come forward?
5116680	5118800	What was your objective?
5118800	5122360	Well, I just think the truth should have been out.
5122360	5127000	I don't think that this should be secret and I don't think people should be dying and
5127000	5130400	being threatened about ETs or craft or anything.
5130400	5132400	It just sounds ridiculous to me.
5132400	5138920	So my motivation was, you know what, somebody else out there besides the guys I was with
5138920	5146680	and myself have had to have similar experiences and maybe maybe there's a chance in hell that
5146680	5149080	mine connects the dots for something.
5149080	5154800	Maybe my story can help other people to an extent as crazy as it sounds and don't get
5154800	5155800	me wrong.
5155800	5160080	I agree that it's absolutely sounds fucking nuts, but they're not in my shoes and I wish
5160080	5163720	some people were because it'd be like, you guys would just shut up.
5163720	5164720	You guys would stay quiet.
5164720	5166760	You guys were like, yeah, that's not cool to talk about.
5166760	5172120	I don't enjoy talking about it, but that was kind of my, my intention was maybe that this
5172120	5177560	could help paint a picture or contribute in some way, shape or form.
5177560	5178560	Yeah.
5178560	5182160	And I think, you know, there was, there were whistleblower protections that had recently
5182160	5189920	been been passed and I think I remember you talking about that kind of being part of your
5189920	5190920	motivation like that.
5190920	5191920	Yeah.
5191920	5195880	Now that I have a safety net to an extent making the NDA illegal, you know, so obviously
5196000	5201160	I haven't had any ramifications of that because it's not like, I mean, I've had harassment,
5201160	5204960	but you know, and the harassment service is more of like, okay, well, obviously I'm pissing
5204960	5211440	the right people off, you know, so if I, again, I have documentation of all the harassment
5211440	5215560	that I've talked to with multiple people who know what's going on.
5215560	5219000	If I was making any of this up, there wouldn't be this harassment, there wouldn't be these
5219000	5224520	insiders or wouldn't be this, I wouldn't have a leg to stand on with, with other facts.
5224760	5228680	Now there are facts in my world that says somebody else observing outside of my circle,
5228680	5233240	they may say, okay, in their world it may not be facts, but for me in my world it is.
5233240	5239040	When I first connected with you after my initial Reddit post kind of just researching the military
5239040	5244880	side of the operation and like realizing that, you know, everything you said to a letter
5244880	5251400	was accurate regarding the kind of surrounding circumstances and I was like, okay, well what's
5251400	5255640	next, you know, and so we, you know, I reached out, we connected.
5255640	5263120	If I'm honest, I actually grew more skeptical as we started talking because you all of a
5263120	5267680	sudden started talking about this insider and I'm like, this is weird, like what are
5267680	5272960	the chances that you would have this experience and now all of a sudden someone telling you
5272960	5276920	that they know what you saw and they want to meet with you.
5276920	5281000	So you know, I didn't have anybody else that I was talking to with this, I don't, I don't
5281040	5284080	have a lot of friends, I don't care to have a lot of friends, I got a lot of acquaintances,
5284080	5286640	I got a lot of people who know who I am to an extent.
5286640	5290200	My world is just business and that's what I, you know, I separate this from business
5290200	5295640	because business is what my livelihood and my employees are, that's what I care about
5295640	5298520	as well as the disclosure of wanting the truth to come out.
5298520	5302800	So it's not like I had anybody else to say, hey, and then when I saw what you were doing
5302800	5308480	and I saw the attention to detail and everything that you were piecing together, that kind
5308520	5312360	of put something in my mind to say, you know what, maybe this guy can help me out to an
5312360	5317880	extent, maybe there's things that he could probably pinpoint or, or connect the dots
5317880	5323160	on and just your attention to detail was just something that's like, you know what, this
5323160	5325720	guy's got to ship together.
5325720	5329600	Maybe I'm able to provide information to you that, because you seem like you, you're well
5329600	5331040	versed in this, I'm not.
5331040	5335200	I know what I experienced and there's other things I'm now learning, especially with your
5335240	5339640	guys' help, especially pointing out to me things that I can pass on to other people
5339640	5342920	and say, yeah, Rene, is this having any legitimacy to it?
5342920	5349200	So, yeah, I was surprised at the amount of trust that you kind of put into me, right?
5349200	5353400	Because like if you had, if you had like told stuff to the wrong person, you could have
5353400	5357960	been, but I had a good chance of reading you and kind of gauging you, which is why we had
5357960	5359960	a phone call that we initially had.
5359960	5368400	And the biggest, the, the most craziest, biggest moment for me was, you know, you were talking
5368400	5370520	about this insider who wanted to meet with you.
5370520	5371840	I was so skeptical.
5371840	5374320	It sounded so crazy, but like I had nothing to lose.
5374320	5378480	It wasn't like I was this podcaster who like had to report on the story.
5378480	5383160	Like I could back away from the whole thing if I, if it fell apart and I felt sketchy
5383160	5384160	about it.
5384160	5385760	I was like, you know what, let's just see what happens.
5385760	5389920	We had a phone call the day before I recorded that without your knowledge.
5390480	5396240	Oh, I was freaked out because these guys could have done anything.
5396240	5397240	I was going to their backyard.
5397240	5400640	I wanted to scream at you and like say, dude, don't go.
5400640	5405720	I know, but I had to, I had to learn the truth and that's what they were offering.
5405720	5406720	They weren't offering money.
5406720	5408200	They weren't offering anything like that.
5408200	5413120	They were offering a chance to set me and set the record straight of what I witnessed.
5413120	5420000	And I think after keeping this, you know, it's quiet for 14 plus years.
5420000	5421360	I think I deserve the truth.
5421360	5426120	I think everybody deserves the truth because for what's going on is absolute bullshit of
5426120	5433000	why it's secret and why these guys feel in the right mind that they want to kidnap people
5433000	5440400	or offer them a way out of their situation and use them as a biological equipment in
5440400	5443920	these programs is just, it doesn't sit well with me.
5443920	5449440	I understand why, but I think if there was some kind of government intervention with
5449440	5453240	this that there may be good people that want to volunteer, maybe see what they can do and
5453240	5454960	if they can, that's their thing.
5454960	5459760	And I understand that these guys are also doing the same thing, but I think they're
5459760	5461760	given false promises.
5461760	5465040	I think they're being misled like they are because that's why they're partaking in this
5465040	5468040	and they don't understand the magnitude of what they're doing.
5468040	5472120	And from my current knowledge, I know that a lot of them don't know what they're getting
5472120	5476640	involved with because they're heavily drugged and they can't recall what they're doing specifically
5476640	5478560	with what they're making contact with.
5478560	5479560	Yeah.
5479560	5480560	I wanted to ask you about this.
5480560	5486240	So it was during the NPC, you learned that these crates weren't trafficking drugs, but
5486240	5488600	people.
5488600	5490880	So I did a two day event prior to that.
5490880	5493520	It was June 10th, 11th and 12th.
5493520	5496000	Was it the 12th that the NPC was on?
5496000	5497000	Yeah.
5497000	5502120	And then a Daily Mail article came out the 10th or 11th and the NPC was out of the 12th.
5502120	5510080	Because I had talked to Josh Boswell with Daily Mail prior to going to DC.
5510080	5513460	And Greer was the one that set all that up.
5513460	5522640	And my goal as much as I possibly can is having some transparency because I think that's important.
5522640	5525500	And as uncomfortable it is for me to be public.
5525500	5532220	I don't enjoy it, but if I'm able to provide in any kind of asset to disclosure in any
5532220	5535300	kind of way, I'm not here for money.
5535300	5536300	Everybody knows that.
5536300	5538740	I sleep good because I'm not for that cause.
5538740	5542140	I make my own money as you guys know, you guys have seen.
5542140	5547500	So and it's even crazier that I got employees that don't know what I'm doing.
5547500	5549780	And I don't talk about it freely.
5549780	5551300	There's some people who do and they're kind of curious.
5551300	5553380	Did they just like kind of find out on their own?
5553380	5554380	Yeah.
5555380	5557340	Some people talk.
5557340	5561180	So I assume that some people don't know because nobody asks me.
5561180	5565100	Some people have seen what I did and they're texting me, man, that's, you know, they kind
5565100	5566580	of try to get in detail with it.
5566580	5568700	I'm like, I can't tell you much, man.
5568700	5576100	You know this, you know, just jumping back to, I just wanted to emphasize that the biggest
5576100	5580500	moment for me and you actually at this point, you're kind of like totally read into all
5580500	5582340	of the evidence that I have.
5582340	5589620	So like that meeting you had with the insider was the pivotal moment for me because that
5589620	5595460	conversation that you and I had prior to the day before that meeting gave me very specific
5595460	5601820	starting point to be able to track the helicopter.
5601820	5609580	I knew the location where you guys were meeting and it just, it set up a way for me to verify
5609580	5610580	a lot of things.
5610580	5611580	Correct.
5611700	5613140	It was an important piece of evidence.
5613140	5616460	And so that is what led me to...
5616460	5618260	To verify on your own accord.
5618260	5620580	To verify without you even knowing.
5620580	5621580	Correct.
5621580	5622580	Where you went.
5622580	5625180	I was really surprised when you told me after the fact.
5625180	5627300	I was like, how the fuck did you find that?
5627300	5631780	And I was like, okay, now that it's obvious after that point.
5631780	5638260	And I think it was a good slip up to an extent because it was able to at least pinpoint somebody
5638260	5640620	to be able to verify.
5640620	5647380	Because with that helicopter flight, you were as well as I was able to provide other events
5647380	5648380	that were going on.
5648380	5652460	Yeah, that was the other thing because like prior to me revealing to you that I like
5652460	5657620	tracked it on radar, I was like, hey, do you remember what time you took off and you told
5657620	5660980	me and it was exactly what the radar said?
5660980	5662340	I was like, holy crap.
5662340	5670180	And then, yeah, there were some kind of limited time kind of events that were happening on
5670180	5676420	the ground that could be visible from the air and you corroborated that.
5676420	5685700	I was able to cross check that with local news and like I've spoken to you about how
5685700	5689860	I authenticated the evidence and used...
5689860	5693780	And the only thing I could say without going into specifics is you know where I went.
5693780	5694780	Yeah.
5694780	5698020	That's all we're going to talk about at the moment.
5698020	5702460	And I know you know now because he's provided and I've okayed that because I think some
5702460	5703620	people should know.
5703620	5705660	I trust you guys.
5705660	5709500	You've been by my side for a year without finally meeting you today.
5709500	5711780	It's still crazy.
5711780	5712780	Yes.
5712780	5715620	But I can tell because I read people very well.
5715620	5716740	That's where sales comes into.
5716740	5719100	I can kind of gauge.
5719100	5723380	And I know that you're for the truth and I know you are too.
5723380	5724380	And I am as well.
5724380	5728020	We're all in the same shoes as far as wanting this to come forward and wanting this whole
5728020	5731740	thing to stop because our way of life can improve.
5731740	5736460	The Insider provided a lot of information for you to disseminate.
5736460	5737460	Yes.
5737460	5746660	And granted, it was tough for me because they were in attendance and it was a group of day,
5746660	5747660	not pronouns.
5747700	5749940	They were in the NPC 2023.
5749940	5752300	They were there but they were also there at the other events.
5752300	5753980	The one three days before.
5753980	5755660	It was two days.
5755660	5757860	So it was a 10th, 11th and 12th.
5757860	5762340	So it was during, was that on a Monday, the NPC?
5762340	5764100	Let me look real quick.
5764100	5767020	So you were talking about just a couple of days before the NPC.
5767020	5769380	That's when you first kind of met these insiders.
5769380	5774940	So I didn't meet them directly but I know that they were in attendance.
5775820	5781780	And when I had presented on that Saturday, I believe, is when it was.
5781780	5782780	Saturday and Sunday.
5782780	5789940	Yeah, I think it was the Saturday and Sunday because I got in Friday afternoon or morning
5789940	5791580	and then they went to the hotel.
5791580	5795700	I had dinner with Greer and everybody kind of met them.
5795700	5799940	Actually, it was a couple of drinks at the hotel.
5799940	5803140	And then we got our rooms, got everything situated.
5803140	5806060	Going downstairs, I introduced my wife to everybody too that I've already been kind
5806060	5808940	of somewhat familiar with and talking to.
5808940	5812540	And it was my first time of meeting some people like Michael Stratton person, Dr. Greer
5812540	5813540	in person.
5813540	5816980	Well, no, that'd be the second time because he was here in Boulder.
5816980	5821140	That's when I first actually met him and I was in 2017.
5821140	5828420	And I was, I just kind of felt that he was somebody at the time who was talking about
5828420	5834260	this and there were some things that he had hinted that were may have been maybe other
5834260	5837060	people of experience would have experienced that he was talking to.
5837060	5839940	So I wanted to tell him, Hey, this was my situation.
5839940	5844660	You know, anybody else who went through this, maybe it's something I can convey and compare
5844660	5845660	notes to this person.
5845660	5851500	And of course, they don't, some of them are dead and some of them refuse to talk understandably.
5851500	5853540	But yes, these insiders were there.
5853540	5858660	So when I had did that event and it may be on YouTube, I can't find it anywhere.
5858660	5862860	It may be on YouTube or some, because I know it was recorded because Dr. Greer and myself
5862860	5867740	were kind of frustrated that their audio and video people were kind of slacking.
5867740	5878980	I had given my piece that day and I had expressed that what I hypothesized was drugs, right?
5878980	5884020	And that's when Dr. Greer pulled me aside and showed me his phone that had text message
5884020	5886900	from this individual that had, he had this encrypted app.
5886900	5893860	It was not signal with some other high tech communication platform did not look like signal.
5893860	5899780	And I read the text message and what that text message said was, and my wife was actually
5899780	5904260	sitting on the couch in the, in the green room and I was close to her and Dr. Greer was standing
5904260	5906660	to my right.
5906660	5912860	And the text message said, I don't want to leave Michael hanging, but I know what Michael
5912860	5920340	saw and he went through this whole, he wrote a Bible essentially of what it was to an extent.
5920340	5928100	But he had talked, he wanted to now talk to Dr. Greer privately and discuss what it was.
5928100	5932620	And so I, at that point, because I was, I was volunteered security for him, which is
5932620	5936380	what I'm doing with this too, but it's more of me to kind of see what the fuck else is
5936380	5937380	going on.
5937380	5939100	That's just how I can get information.
5939100	5943900	So you do, you perform, you help benefit somebody, but you also get to kind of learn more in
5943900	5947860	depth with what's kind of being going on and you get to be in the sensitive meetings and
5947860	5953540	stuff and kind of really see, so it's kind of my personal way to kind of disseminate
5953540	5957300	information and maybe be able to understand.
5957300	5962820	That's just my curiosity, but I met that gentleman, which of course he didn't know that I knew
5962820	5966060	who he was to an extent because Greer said he was going to meet with him and maybe they
5966100	5971420	were going to put me in a green room and have a face-to-face conversation, which never happened.
5971420	5975580	And then I wake up to a text message that he sent me at two o'clock in the morning.
5975580	5980940	I don't remember what day, I still have it because I have it all saved, of course, just
5980940	5981940	in case.
5981940	5984980	I have a paper trail just in case anything happens.
5984980	5997060	And he had said that a gentleman's name, to an extent, knows what I saw and would like
5997060	6002900	to talk to me about it, and he is the knock, non-official covers what that stands for in
6002900	6012180	the CIA term, and he gave me his phone number, which is one of many, at least that number.
6012180	6018940	So I was like, oh shit, okay, and it wasn't like I wasn't expecting it because I was like,
6018940	6023380	okay, this guy probably won't bother with me, he'll just tell Dr. Greer everything and
6023380	6029460	then Dr. Greer will tell me what I dealt with and experienced, but that wasn't the case.
6029460	6036500	So I sat on it for probably about a day or two because I was like, okay, here's a point
6036500	6040860	and I'll return realistically, and then I was like, you know what, fuck it.
6040860	6048060	So you're referring to he wanted to meet with you, what was the message that you sat on?
6048060	6052900	So the message I sat on was Dr. Greer providing me his contact information.
6052900	6054340	So that's what I sat on.
6054340	6059820	And so I was just thinking every scenario in my head, like oh fuck, what am I going
6059820	6066260	to, what is this doing, am I getting set up, was part of that too, I mean it's a percentage.
6066260	6069020	Because I'm nervous, you know, I've already kind of said my piece, I'm nervous now the
6069020	6075900	whole world knows what I disclosed and it was very uncomfortable, I hate fucking being
6075900	6080940	public, but it's just, it's something that needs to be done.
6080940	6087380	And he had, I called him and he did not answer and he did not have a voicemail set, so then
6087380	6091820	I texted him and he responded immediately.
6091820	6095620	And I have it, I have the text messages and basically what he said, he was going to fly
6095620	6101220	me out somewhere and he was going to be able to provide me documentation among other things
6101220	6107180	that will help me with this, but now that I came forward, these guys were working in
6107180	6111180	that organization that I witnessed doing this operation.
6111180	6115220	He had some insight to tell me and that's what we did, we met up and you had the phone
6115220	6122620	call of that and you have some details about where I met this gentleman particularly and
6122620	6125620	where he flew me off to, to provide me more information.
6125620	6130100	Now why do you feel like he wanted to meet you in person versus just talking on the phone
6130100	6132220	or video call, that sort of thing?
6132220	6133420	Like what was that?
6133420	6136460	I think it was establishing trust.
6136460	6141220	It's easy to talk to people on the phone, getting face to face with people and having
6141220	6142620	them tell you things.
6142620	6147300	Now granted, when him and I met and we were sitting across from each other, and I've said
6147300	6151540	this in multiple interviews, but I had my phone off because he had had this one that
6151540	6156620	can detect any chips and I showed you the text message, or the message that he sent
6156620	6161780	me talking about why they did that and which they're all chipped.
6161780	6165540	So that's all I'm going to say about that.
6165540	6170860	But I guess it was a chance to get the truth and I can tell when he was talking to me that
6170860	6175700	he was very fidgety and very nervous because he doesn't know who I am and I don't know
6175700	6176700	who he is.
6176700	6180000	So him being nervous, but he looked through my background.
6180000	6183520	He looked at every possible detail about me, so he knew everything.
6183520	6188440	So I know that he knew that wasn't some asset planted in trying to fish people out, which
6188440	6192360	I know is a concern of theirs, which is why they're screening people heavily and do what
6192360	6194000	they do.
6194000	6200800	So which I was just as nervous and that's when he, during that interview or meet up,
6200800	6207120	that meeting, that's when he provided me a sidearm as a way to establish trust.
6207240	6211920	And I looked at the bullets and there were no struck primers, nothing like that, popped
6211920	6217840	it in, wrapped it, put it on a lap like this and nobody else was armed.
6217840	6222400	At that point, I kind of started getting to know him a little bit personally, some personal
6222400	6226920	details about who he is and what he does and other things.
6226920	6230520	He's got a family, which is great because it tells me he's on the right side of things
6230520	6235000	and he loves his family very much as you should.
6235080	6240160	And that kind of gave me hope that, okay, this guy actually is taking that into consideration,
6240160	6241160	which tells me everything.
6241160	6246320	And his body language was also what conveyed it to me too because he's very fidgety with
6246320	6247320	his watch.
6247320	6250600	He's kind of like trying to adjust himself and it's like, okay, I know you're telling
6250600	6254480	the truth because this is making you uncomfortable as much as it is making me.
6254480	6259040	And there was also sort of an apology that he gave to you.
6259040	6260040	Yes, he did.
6260040	6261040	Can you talk about that a little bit?
6261080	6265600	He apologized saying that he's sorry that we went through that, that it's absolutely
6265600	6269760	unnecessary and it's bullshit and that shouldn't be happening to anybody.
6269760	6273560	And he knows of instances where they, yes, they have murdered people, not him directly,
6273560	6275600	but he will never kill a patriot.
6275600	6280400	He will never kill innocent people, but that guy will murder and kill bad guys as it should
6280400	6282480	be because he's like a sheepdog.
6282480	6284880	And all of these guys that I'm working with are the same way.
6284880	6286680	They're all good people.
6286680	6290320	And some people have had confusion to say, oh, we're, we're, how the gunpoint with these
6290320	6294600	guys and all of a sudden they're welcoming me in and, and giving me this, this knowledge
6294600	6295600	and trust.
6295600	6297080	No, it's not the same people.
6297080	6298080	These are the good guys.
6298080	6299080	Very few.
6299080	6302520	So these guys weren't involved with the operation you witnessed in 2009.
6302520	6303520	No, they were not.
6303520	6305120	But they are aware of those types of.
6305120	6306120	Yes.
6306120	6310440	And they've been on similar operations as that to my understanding.
6310440	6313880	And so he showed you some things.
6313880	6314880	Yes.
6315080	6316640	You've said you went underground.
6316640	6318640	I can't talk about any of this.
6318640	6319640	Okay.
6319640	6324320	I don't, I don't, I'm not going to ask you what you saw.
6324320	6330240	What I, what I want to ask you is why did he show you that in the sense of?
6330240	6336400	What, what you could ask is what the things that he has been able to show you were proof.
6336400	6340640	It was a way of him able to prove who he said, who he really was.
6340640	6343280	That's exactly what I was.
6343280	6347560	It wasn't like I can just take his word and just say, okay, I trust you.
6347560	6352000	It was a way for them to say, these are the real deal guys.
6352000	6355080	Because it's not like anybody can just see this shit.
6355080	6359360	And I hope one day I can get to a point where I can talk about that.
6359360	6362400	And because it is, it is mind blowing.
6362400	6366800	And I thought what I witnessed on, in 14, 15 years ago was mind blowing.
6366800	6368280	Yes, it is.
6368280	6373120	But now you actually see things face to face of what, you know.
6373760	6385560	Because, I'll put it this way, that facility, if these guys were to link up with two politicians
6385560	6392480	and then give them a free access card to everything, it would single-handedly blow the doors
6392480	6400640	off of this whole chicanery of misinformation and all the lies and all the deceit that are
6400640	6401640	being there.
6401640	6402640	This would prove everything.
6403160	6407280	They're doing that right now, but they're trying to plan it out.
6407280	6410560	And what way I don't know, but that's what their goal is.
6410560	6417760	And I can't give any details about that being mic'd up and all this, but I can tell you otherwise.
6417760	6419160	But they're upset.
6419160	6422080	A lot of them are upset.
6422080	6428520	I guess what I'm getting at is like, what's their objective with this?
6428520	6434280	With reaching out to you and informing this partnership or relationship with you, what
6434280	6436200	is their ultimate motive?
6436200	6442360	Because these are people who are first-hand participants in the program.
6442360	6444280	Yes, for 30-plus years.
6444280	6445280	Yeah.
6445280	6449280	And so their pro-disclosure to a certain extent?
6449280	6451720	Pro-American, pro-freedom, pro-life.
6451720	6456000	You know, obviously they don't like that people are being murdered over this kind of stuff.
6456000	6458280	So there's kind of factions within...
6458280	6462880	Yes, that's exactly what people call the program, and these are kind of considered the good
6462880	6472160	guys who want to support some level of disclosure and restore an oversight by Congress.
6472160	6478760	So the other reason is that these guys were somewhat tasked to try to go through us or
6478760	6480960	infiltrate, right?
6480960	6485960	I think what would have happened is these guys would have been whistleblowers or considered
6485960	6487960	whistleblowers themselves.
6487960	6492240	Not in a public fashion like I'm doing or anybody else that's in my shoes.
6492240	6499960	But I think what happened was now that I came forward and what I experienced is directly
6499960	6504800	related and directly involved with what they've been doing, it was more of a chance for them
6504800	6510120	to say, okay, we can lay low, but now we have a spokesperson for us that can get this information
6510120	6514560	out and help us get information out to the right people.
6514560	6517520	And that was successful and they'll be able to do that.
6517520	6521920	But I was also successful and able to get them in contact with certain other prominent
6521920	6522920	people.
6522920	6526000	Do these guys, these insiders have any fear of coming forward?
6526000	6530400	I personally have talked to some whistleblowers who are allegedly afraid to speak because
6530400	6534560	they will lose pension, they will basically, they and their family will not have a way
6534560	6535560	to provide.
6535560	6541760	Yes, they will lose everything if this is not done correctly and carefully.
6541760	6544760	And again, I don't know if these guys are coming forward.
6544760	6547640	I can't specifically say that, I don't know.
6547640	6550480	I just, maybe one day they will.
6550480	6551480	Who knows?
6551480	6561280	What do you think needs to happen or if you can convey what these guys have said, what
6561280	6567120	needs to happen or change in order for more first-hand participants like them to be able
6567120	6569480	to come forward, what needs to happen?
6569480	6573720	The tables need to flip as far as the, the majority of these people in these programs
6573720	6575120	are good people.
6575120	6579520	That's what I, from my own interactions with some of these people, granted I'm not working
6579520	6581360	with everybody, right?
6581360	6585240	But the ones that I know very well now, they're good people, they got their heart in the right
6585240	6588020	place and they got the right mindset for this.
6588020	6594080	What would need to happen is that the tables need to turn as far as them flipping the tables
6594080	6599600	on their own programs, meaning taking control of them personally, getting the bad guys or
6599600	6604520	neutralizing that, however, because what people need to understand is that this group is the
6604520	6610760	enforcement arm of even the political corruption that's going on because they have assets in
6610760	6617720	certain places in government, local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, military, everywhere.
6617720	6623120	So if they were able to single-handedly take the bad guys out or flip the script or gain
6623120	6629120	control of that, because right now there's a war between the good and bad of these factions.
6629120	6632960	The bad guys want to keep this secret and they want to keep this technology to themselves
6632960	6637920	and they want to commit crimes against humanity with this technology and have this power and
6637920	6643000	control while the good guys want this to come forward and everybody benefit from it and
6643000	6646320	us as a species be able to survive.
6646320	6649840	Also the fact that they know directly what is going on because they're living in this
6649840	6650840	world.
6651200	6653720	Day-to-day job, so to speak.
6653720	6658200	So I think now that they have an opportunity to understand that this is affecting other
6658200	6664880	people besides me, besides, I mean, it's affecting all of us because we could be, we could really
6664880	6674280	be far in life with this technology and not only that, we could stop shooting down NHI
6675280	6682760	because who's to say, I've never met any of them, I don't know any ETs or NHI, I can't,
6682760	6685160	never came face to face with them.
6685160	6690760	What I can tell you is that I know that the universe is massive and there's multi-dimensional
6690760	6695640	universes or however this works with the theories that people have proposed and if that really
6695640	6701200	is the case, the possibility that we can come across a species that ain't going to be too
6701200	6703760	friendly with us is a possibility.
6703760	6708400	So you're telling, and this is what the concept is, so this group is going to target them,
6708400	6717080	shoot them down in the deserts, all over the world, in secluded areas and they are going
6717080	6722920	to come across at a point maybe someday that they're going to shoot down the wrong type
6722920	6727480	and maybe that type becomes a type that decides that, hey, you know what, we don't need these
6727480	6732960	people around, we don't need this species around and they decide that we as people
6732960	6740960	who don't even partake in that nonsense have to pay for it, meaning that our lives end
6740960	6746800	as they can instantly do it if they wanted to with what I have been told and what I've
6746800	6752800	understand how powerful they are if they're able to travel inter-dimensionally and through
6752800	6756640	time and space and be able to show up here and go to any other place that they want to
6756640	6763640	go and be able to control craft through consciousness and be able to pretty much, the way that they
6763640	6768080	even said that, and this is just speculation of course because I've never seen this personally,
6768080	6771680	but the way that they are actually able to be go through things, be inter-dimensional
6771680	6776800	so it can be in 3D or just have the image of, but they can also pass through solid objects
6776800	6781040	like it's almost them, their molecules or atoms splitting between all of those to separate
6781040	6787120	them somehow, so that's just speculation, but that's what I've been told.
6787120	6792160	And so if you have something that advanced and some very smart that can end our lives,
6792160	6796280	this whole planet if they wanted to, and for some reason they choose not to, but yet we
6796280	6802360	keep shooting them down, and that means us as a human species.
6802360	6807000	So you described kind of the next step forward is for the good guys to kind of flip the tables
6807120	6814120	on the bad guys, but what about the whole side of like legislation? Is that still an important
6817280	6818280	factor?
6818280	6824960	Well that allows certain things to happen to where there's involvement from both sides
6824960	6830160	because there's laws that have to be abided by, there has to be military involvement to
6830160	6836660	an extent, and there also has to be a law enforcement effort because essentially there's
6836660	6840060	a lot of laws being broken with all of these, and that's kind of the thing that maybe they
6840060	6843580	can get them on a technicality to get some laws passed that now all of a sudden these
6843580	6848100	guys can't hide within that because now there's proof that there's stuff going on that the
6848100	6851420	law enforcement like U.S. Marshals for example, because they have jurisdiction everywhere,
6851420	6857820	it could be the ones to execute whatever they need to, that's just technically speaking.
6857820	6864740	And what about like how can we get more people like the insiders you're working with to come
6864780	6869980	forward? Are there, you know, there seems to be kind of like, yeah, we have whistleblower
6869980	6872580	protection, but it's really not enough.
6872580	6875020	It's really not enough, and that's exactly their concern.
6875020	6879580	Yeah, so what do they think needs to be done from that aspect?
6879580	6884260	These politicians need to get their shit together, and they can't be corrupt like we're seeing
6884260	6888420	with the whole pushback of the M&N domain and all that kind of stuff because these aerospace
6888420	6892100	companies are paying some of these guys. So of course, hey, we'll throw you an X amount
6892100	6896180	of money if you play ball for us and make it to where it's hard for them to accomplish
6896180	6898860	what they want because then all of a sudden the game's up.
6898860	6902020	These aerospace companies know what's going on. They're going to pretend that they don't,
6902020	6906500	but they have access to this shit. And it may not even be the executives of these companies
6906500	6910580	who know what's going on, but the contractors and the people that are within these groups
6910580	6913060	know exactly what's going on and have access to it.
6913060	6918020	And it's a very, it's relatively a small number. It's not like every single Boeing personnel
6918020	6924780	or a Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or Northrop Grumman for that matter would have, every single
6924780	6929260	person knows what's going on. They don't. Only certain groups in that do.
6929260	6933060	And to touch quickly on what you were talking about about shooting down these craft, are
6933060	6937300	you aware of in the program with these insiders if there's kind of an ethical tug of war going
6937300	6938300	on that?
6938300	6939300	100%.
6939300	6940300	Okay.
6940300	6944980	And that's kind of why they feel the need to want to divulge information to me to spread
6944980	6948740	it to you guys and to the world for that matter.
6948740	6953540	The other aspect of it too is over these installations that civilian aircraft are being targeted as
6953540	6958020	well when they're flying into these temporary flight restricted areas or TFRs.
6958020	6961820	And it's in people, they will go for a flight, want to go see some scenic views of some of
6961820	6966340	these areas that are beautiful nearby, but happen to stumble into the area just like we
6966340	6972900	did at the wrong point of time. And now they get hit with these experimental weapons. Well,
6972900	6977460	you can't even call them experimental because they're using them. They're not known. They're
6977460	6978900	relatively, yeah.
6978900	6983500	Are you aware of what these offensive UAP weapons are, how they work?
6983500	6988700	I can't give specifics to it. It's a lot of them. I've only been, I only know of a few,
6988700	6991860	but as far as the other ones that are more cutting edge, because like again, they keep
6991860	6996180	refining their systems because they want to make sure that they can just take them out
6996180	7002820	with a single hit and have an easier time doing it, I would suppose. That's just speculation,
7002820	7007780	but they're always refining their stuff. They're always refining their reverse engineer
7007780	7012620	technologies as well, which is why they test these weapons systems on them. So they had
7012620	7018380	to explain that they put them, they put craft on balloons, have them go up to high altitude
7018380	7022140	and then they hit them with these weapons because there's nobody aboard, right? And
7022140	7025220	then they also have them stationary on the ground and they can hit them at different
7025220	7034660	angles to make sure that it's, but what they have explained to me was that their EMP proof,
7034660	7041660	what they have, they are, they are not vulnerable to any kind of modern ammunition like rifle
7041660	7048020	bullets or 50 cal machine gun ammo or ammunition or rounds. Missiles can't penetrate through
7048020	7049020	their weapons.
7049020	7050020	You're talking about UAP?
7050020	7051020	That they have, yes.
7051020	7052020	Okay.
7052020	7053020	They meaning?
7053020	7054020	Yes.
7054020	7055020	That they've designed and made.
7055020	7056020	Oh, okay.
7056020	7061020	So like the ARV reverse engineer, okay.
7061020	7065140	Yes. Most of the ones that are coming out, and this is what some of the insiders had
7065140	7072740	said. They are having a very hard time distinguishing the real craft from NHI compared to the ones
7072740	7078580	that they've got. That's how far they've came with this technology. They can't identify
7078580	7081500	one from the other. It's getting to that point.
7081500	7087820	So it's practically been a year, almost within a week since you came forward.
7087820	7088820	Correct.
7088820	7096620	What's next for you? Has your motivation for coming forward now changed? Has your objective
7096620	7102940	now changed now that you've met with the insider and kind of gotten involved with that side?
7102940	7108940	Yes it has because I feel like I can now help these guys in any way that I possibly can.
7108940	7113140	I've been doing that behind the scenes and it's good. It feels good to do that. It feels
7113140	7117380	good to be on the right set of history with this and when everything does come to a head,
7117380	7122100	hopefully there can be some positive movements that blow this all wide open and we can all
7122100	7125380	benefit. We could all be better people at the end of the day. That's what I want. That's
7125380	7126820	my mission.
7126820	7131140	The other aspect is obviously being provided the information that people are being taken
7131140	7136900	and used in these programs. That doesn't sit well with me. When I heard that, I couldn't
7136940	7140420	sleep for a week. There's many times where I've hidden in the bathroom and literally
7140420	7145100	busted down fucking crime because it's like, I couldn't do anything to stop that at that
7145100	7152100	time, which sucks to know that. You're completely helpless. So I feel like it's my mission
7152100	7157660	to get the right oversight to an extent and maybe there can be things that can happen
7157660	7163740	on a global scale that get these programs to be known programs and maybe the right ways
7163740	7167820	can be done with these where people don't have to be sedated. People don't have to be
7167820	7172980	treated as if they're biological equipment or pink assets, as they call them, that they
7172980	7178420	can actually have people gain a foothold and do this peacefully and make us all better
7178420	7185300	people and everybody can live happily. Everybody can live evolved. We can stop paying utilities
7185300	7190100	because free energy will be a thing. Maybe I got fast cars, but maybe I can get some
7190140	7194940	faster shit that I can drive around or fly around in for that matter. However, that comes
7194940	7201940	about. But I think what the optimism is that our world can be significantly better, but
7204380	7209620	we have to go through some very hard times for this to happen. I don't have children,
7209620	7214380	but I know you do and I know that your children do benefit from having a better world that
7214380	7218020	they can grow up and experience and not have to go through the corruption and see what
7218140	7222780	we're dealing with as people right now who understand what's going on. And I know these
7222780	7228340	insiders families also deserve the same. Like I said, I don't want any money from this.
7228340	7233100	All I want is for this to come forward. All I want is this world to get better and change.
7233100	7240100	That's my mission. Anybody who has any problems with me not accepting money? Tough shit.
7241140	7245620	I make my own money. I'm not bought and paid for like most of these people who try to keep
7245660	7249780	this shit hidden or secret or threaten them. They can threaten me all they want, but all
7249780	7254460	it's doing is pissing us off and get us pissed off enough. And we actually do something that
7254460	7260460	actually, because here's the problem. As much as I would like to say or believe me, everybody,
7260460	7266380	because what I'm saying can be verified to an extent, which I choose not to because I'm
7266380	7273380	keeping people safe in the process, as you guys know, but be skeptical.
7275980	7280140	Because there are people coming forward who should not be or they're muddying the waters
7280140	7284820	to an extent and they're very known people. I don't get in drama of this shit. I don't
7284820	7289580	care to. I've got my direction of where I'm going and that's what I'm focused on. I let
7289580	7295140	other people gossip and talk while I'm just focused. So that's what they can do. People
7295140	7298820	need to understand that yes, as much as I want people to believe what I'm saying, but
7298820	7303460	at the end of the day, disclosure is about evidence. It's not about testimony. It's not
7303460	7307780	about what I say. If I had proof.
7307780	7311300	So you think evidence is coming at some point?
7311300	7317100	Very much so. How it will happen, I have no idea. But I hope it does and I hope it comes
7317100	7320740	full force because then it's going to kind of catch a lot of people with their pants
7320740	7324580	down. People who pretend in the government that they don't know what's going on, but
7324580	7329660	they fully will do because they're getting paid from it under the table. So it's going
7329660	7333980	to be interesting how, oh yeah, you didn't know that this existed, but here's some documentation
7333980	7338140	or some people are saying that you were being paid for it. But yet they got this material
7338140	7343940	or whatever it is that they have that's actually out. And now people know for a fact, oh shit,
7343940	7350020	NHIRT exists guys. And we've had access to this and we've been in communication to an
7350020	7352460	extent for a very long time.
7352460	7358380	And I just got to ask two quick closing questions if you don't mind. I think it was on the Total
7358380	7363580	Disclosure podcast. You talked about that you had been in contact with David Grush. Can
7363580	7365180	you comment on that?
7365180	7367580	I've talked to him and that's all I can say.
7367580	7371060	Okay. And two, this is just kind of a personal one because I've seen this bounced around
7371060	7377020	a lot. I have seen many people call you Joey and Joey your publicist. You two are not the
7377020	7380220	same person. And Joey, are you Michael's publicist?
7380220	7381220	Not at all.
7381220	7383860	Are you anything other than a private citizen who's investigating Michael's case?
7383860	7385180	Just a random guy.
7385180	7386460	Are you paid for by Michael?
7386460	7387460	No.
7387460	7388460	Oh man.
7388460	7389460	Yeah.
7389460	7393340	I know. I can imagine that's the skepticism going on.
7393340	7401180	It's just like Reddit. Most people are just anonymous on Reddit. And I just remained anonymous
7401180	7406180	and now I'm showing my face now for the first time and just trying to crack that open a
7406180	7407180	little bit.
7407180	7408180	Yeah.
7408180	7411780	Well, I mean, there'll be a right time where everything can be divorced and everybody can
7411780	7416140	sleep better, you know? But I just saw what you were doing on Reddit and it's like, you
7416140	7419820	know what? You're a very good person to get information out. I don't know anybody else.
7419820	7424940	And thanks to you, thanks to you, you've been able to link me up with people who have.
7424940	7425940	That's true too.
7425940	7426940	Yeah.
7426940	7429700	You're very good at networking too. And that's part of the reason why I'm successful is
7429700	7434100	because networking is key. And that's, I use the same approach with disclosure. So if
7434100	7438700	I'm in touch with people who are pivotal with this movement, then I'm able to contribute
7438700	7443380	in ways that I possibly can to bring this forward to an extent or however far we can
7443380	7448020	get. And you introduced me to him, you know, which is great because you guys are wonderful
7448020	7452820	guys, very good people, you know? So it's good talking to you guys and just even shooting
7452820	7456100	a shit when we're not talking about this kind of stuff, you know?
7456100	7458820	I can't believe we're sitting here and this is just.
7458820	7459820	I know.
7459820	7460820	It's been a long time coming.
7460820	7464060	It's been a long time. I'm like, you know, if I had time to go out there, I'd definitely
7464060	7468340	go out there and see where, you know, what your part of the world is like and see what
7468340	7470340	you do day to day and you get to experience.
7470340	7472740	You certainly keep busy with everything that you've got to do.
7472740	7477500	Yeah. I'm surprised I'm not completely bald yet. It's getting there, but I got some hymns
7477500	7482620	I'm trying. So hopefully that helps. But, you know, if not, then I'm just going to be
7482620	7484620	another whistleblower that's bald.
7484620	7485620	Yeah, dude. Rock it.
7485620	7493620	Well, this was awesome. I'm, you know, so grateful that you sat down with us and just,
7493680	7498180	yeah, excited to kind of see how things unfold moving forward.
7498180	7505180	Well, from what I kind of understand, it may be pivotal to a point where we get to grip
7505300	7510700	on the right way and it comes forward and everybody understands. It doesn't have to
7510700	7511460	be secret anymore.
