0	6080	He called me on an open line out of the blue, and I could barely believe who he was.
6080	8560	His name was Nat Cobitz.
8560	15800	He was the US Navy's former longtime director of science and technology development.
15800	22760	Their chief R&D scientist, their chief geek for many years, for over 30 years.
22760	28040	He was a beautiful guy, and it was an act of courage on his part.
28200	30200	I remember one of the conversations I had with him was,
30200	31840	do you think there's any good reason?
31840	35640	Because this is the thing I wrestle with, and I know you do as well.
35640	37600	What's the dirty secret?
37600	39440	Why can't we know this?
39440	43440	You know, if the US has recovered technology, why can't we know?
43440	46480	And he hadn't been told that.
46840	51440	And he had that rigid doctrinaire thing about how he wasn't read into that part of it.
52000	54880	And that was a compartmentalized issue.
54880	56280	He wasn't entitled to know about.
56280	58920	What he told me was that he'd been told
58920	64240	that the United States had recovered multiple craft, multiple craft.
64240	67800	And he implied very strongly that Roswell and another case
67800	71680	I'm interested in, Aztec and Kingman, all real incidents.
73280	76000	It didn't start or end with Roswell.
76040	79960	On this channel, we have covered myriad of UFO crash retrieval cases
79960	84080	ranging from brief overviews to exhaustive, full investigations.
84400	86400	These cases differ greatly.
86400	91000	Some featuring a wealth of witnesses, paper trails or threads of investigation,
91000	97040	such as 1933 Magenta, Italy, 1965 Kexford, Pennsylvania, in 1953,
97040	101520	Kingman, Arizona, while other cases are plagued by a lack of witnesses,
101520	106440	controversy or incomplete investigation, such as 2008 Needles, California,
106440	111240	1950 El Indio, Texas or 1974 Koyame, Mexico.
111480	116440	There is one UFO crash retrieval case that seems to exist somewhere in the middle,
116440	122840	a case that is often overshadowed by the most infamous UFO crash retrieval case of all time,
122840	128680	1947's Roswell, that occurred just eight months after in northern New Mexico.
128680	133800	This case is marred by controversy, yet bolstered by tremendous investigation
133800	137160	and witness testimony, a case that has been debunked,
137160	141640	labeled as a hoax several times over, but yet still refuses to die.
141640	147640	The 25 March 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash retrieval.
147640	154280	This incident to me offers unbridled insights into the complexity of UFO crash retrieval,
154280	159080	while the story of the saucer and biologics retrieval has remained consistent across the
159080	164360	decades from several unconnected first and second hand witnesses and informants.
164360	170360	The accusations and reprisals levied against those who have dared to discuss Aztec are indeed
170360	176760	astounding. I'm sure many watching this video are already apprehensive to hear the word Aztec,
176760	180760	after all, the Aztec crash is not without its problems.
180760	187240	The initial sources of the story, Silas Newton and Leo Jabauer are after all convicted conmen,
187240	192760	so this means the case is a simple hoax as Wikipedia and several UFO researchers like
192760	198280	to point out, right? Or is the reputation of these men and the quality of the endless debunks
198280	204520	against Aztec just as complex as the rest of the story itself? Why in the world would I cover a
204520	211160	case that so many have written off as a hoaxed event perpetuated to sell oil-finding devices?
211160	216680	Taking a step back and analyzing almost 80 years of research on this case reveals to me,
216680	223800	just as William Steinman titled his 1986 book, that Aztec is indeed a well-kept secret.
223800	228600	From similarities with the Aztec crash transport and the words of former director of naval
228600	234280	intelligence Sumner Shapiro in conversation with NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler to the
234280	239320	possible involvement of some of the United States' most legendary scientists including
239320	245960	Vannevar Bush, John von Neumann, and J. Robert Oppenheimer. To bizarre late 40s and early 50s
245960	252920	efforts by US agencies such as AFOSI, Air Force Office of Special Investigation, and FBI's attempts
252920	259560	to intercept photos of the crash disc, every single avenue of the Aztec case is rich with
259560	265880	the call for investigation. The Aztec crash may just give us access to travel back in time
265880	272280	and analyze the fledgling years of UFO legacy program operations. Not only to study how the
272280	277880	United States' top minds were employed to study recovered technologies of unknown origin,
277880	283400	but also to gauge the severity with which UFO retrieval teams would attempt to rectify the
283400	290680	public folly that was the July 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. So, travel back in time with me
290680	298040	to the early morning of 25 March 1948 onto a rocky mesa just 12 miles northeast of Aztec,
298040	304200	New Mexico, and let's investigate the case of an enormous crashed disc of non-human origin
304200	309800	taken into the custody of US military and scientists and the ensuing sophisticated campaign
309800	315880	of organized disinformation. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and I am thrilled for you to join me today
315880	323320	as we discuss a case that in my opinion requires a Herculean amount of analysis and investigation,
323320	330840	the 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash retrieval. This investigation serves to comprehensively
330840	337160	analyze the story of Aztec, the witnesses, sources, and reporters involved, the attempts to prove the
337160	343560	case a hoax, as well as the possible structure of early UFO crash retrieval organizations in the
343560	351160	possible involvement of the ever elusive Majestic 12. So, did a 99.9 foot diameter disc manned by
351160	359160	14 to 16 humanoids really crash just south of Durango, Colorado in 1948? Did Bush, Oppenheimer,
359160	364440	Von Neumann, and other esteemed scientists personally investigate the retrieved disc?
364440	369880	Did the interplanetary phenomenon unit really disassemble and take the craft to Los Alamos
369880	375080	National Labs? Or is this case, just as Wikipedia would have you believe,
375080	381640	just a simple hoax by the con men Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer will join me today as we try and
381640	387560	find out. And before we get started, as I just mentioned, the structure of the Aztec case is
387560	393160	labyrinthine, possibly purposely so, and due to the complexity of this case we will primarily
393160	399160	reference six key sources, three of which are sublime books written about the crash saucer,
399160	405960	the legendary 1950s behind the flying saucers by Frank Scali, which introduced the world to Aztec.
405960	412680	1986's hidden gem, UFO crash at Aztec, a well-kept secret by one of my favorite UFO
412680	418120	researchers, William Steinman, which resurrected the case while naming possible officials and
418120	424760	scientists behind the retrieval. 2015's the Aztec UFO incident, the case, evidence,
424760	430920	an elaborate cover-up of one of the most perplexing crashes in history by Scott and Suzanne Ramsey,
430920	435720	which carefully and excellently evaluates the witnesses and sources of Aztec,
435720	440440	addresses skeptics and debunkers, and carefully evaluates the case as a whole.
440440	445560	The last, which is technically a collection of works, is the legendary UFO researcher Leonard
445560	450920	Stringfield and his magnum opus UFO crash retrieval status reports one through seven,
450920	455880	which introduces a plethora of new witnesses, sources, and information to the case.
455880	461080	You may have noticed here, I only listed four of six sources. Well, this is because we will
461080	467640	also address, study, and evaluate the two major debunks to the New Mexico flying saucer retrieval.
467640	473960	1952's flying saucers and the mysterious little men, written by the jealous JP Kahn,
473960	479800	which shot to destroy the Aztec case, author Frank Scali and Scali sources Silas Newton,
479800	486600	and the amalgamation of nine scientists called Dr. G. Kahn falsely labeled as one singular man,
486600	494120	Leo Gabauer. As well as 1975's, the flying saucer crash of 1948 is a hoax by Mike McKellen,
494120	499240	which released just one year after sources of Leonard Stringfield breathed new life into the
499240	505320	case. Now real fast, last thing, many who watch this channel know Steinman's book is one of the
505320	512680	most elusive and coveted UFO crash retrieval books of all time. After all, only 1,000 copies were
512680	517560	ever printed. But guys, I am thrilled to say for this project, I have purchased this title for
517560	524040	myself so we can enjoy high quality scans of pages and images. And with all that out of the way,
524040	525640	let us finally dive in.
525960	535960	Following the Second World War and sitting at the dawn of the Cold War, the Southern U.S. State of New
535960	541400	Mexico was ripe with atomic energy and weapons development. The state employed numerous high
541400	547000	powered radar installations to defend crown jewel weapons testing in RDT&E facilities,
547000	551960	such as Los Alamos National Labs, White Sands Missile Range, and Sandia National Labs from
551960	559080	Soviet bomber attacks. By 1948, the year of our incident, the elder UFO legacy program Gatekeeping
559080	564920	Structure, the Atomic Energy Commission, was engaged in one project, Twinkle, a program that
564920	571480	analyzed UFOs, including green fireballs at Los Alamos, Sandia, and Holloman Air Force Base.
571480	576440	Therefore, I'd say it's safe for us to assume the Atomic Energy Commission in the newly formed
576440	582440	United States Air Force radars detected an object of unknown origin near Aztec, New Mexico,
582440	588600	roughly 160 miles from Los Alamos. Indeed, sources of William Steinman would appear on record in
588600	595000	1986, claiming the craft was identified by three separate Southwest radar installations.
595000	600360	Viewers of my channel will likely recall mention of Los Alamos and Sandia in almost every single
600360	606440	project I do as engaging in UFO legacy program operations from craft and material housing
606440	612040	to TUO or technologies of unknown origin exploitation, and we will expand on this much
612040	618360	more later on. Numerous eyewitnesses described seeing a low-flying saucer-shaped object wobbling
618360	623880	as if it were in peril, colliding or nearly colliding with nearby mesas until it was seen
623880	629960	crashing in nearby Hart Canyon. The subject of local eyewitnesses to Aztec is of tremendous
629960	634840	importance to our investigation, and we will discuss virtually all publicly named Aztec
634840	641160	witnesses later on in our investigation. Citizens, ranchers, two policemen, and nearby
641160	647240	oil field workers quickly arrived to the crash scene. To this day, it is still unknown what
647240	652520	caused this crash after Roswell. Several researchers believe somehow high-powered radar
652520	657960	interfered with the craft's propulsion systems. These sentiments were shared by Colonel Philip
657960	663400	J. Corso of the U.S. Army Foreign Technology Division, who theorized the Roswell crash just
663400	669080	eight months prior had crashed due to radar interference. This becomes all the more interesting
669080	675720	as we describe this crash retrieval. All eyewitness accounts describe the craft as fully undamaged,
675720	680680	but perhaps there is credence to the theory the craft was down via high-powered radar.
680680	685240	During their boots on the ground crusade to validate or falsify the Aztec crash,
685240	691400	Scott and Suzanne Ramsey met with one Lee Crane. Crane worked in the Aztec area during 1950.
691400	698520	Crane discussed how USAF personnel from the El Vado 767 AC&W radar site originally the
698520	703800	Los Alamos radar installation to protect Los Alamos, and one of the sites likely involved with the
703800	709640	tracking of non-human saucers would frequent the same diner as Crane. These Air Force personnel
709640	714760	would bring in freshly killed, half-cooked ducks that they stated had been knocked out of the air
714760	718680	by powerful microwave radar being used at the facility.
718680	723960	Now viewers of my channel will absolutely recall, as recently as my project on SAIC,
723960	729400	that I frequently discuss how Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative,
729400	734520	built to protect the United States from Soviet ICBMs, secretly engaged in highly
734520	740920	compartmentalized, deep-sixed UFO program operations, some of which harnessed STIs,
740920	747000	lethality, and target hardening or particle beam weapons programs to offensively target UFOs with
747000	753480	microwave or X-ray weaponry. In this project, I discussed how SAIC would have likely been the
753480	759000	prime contractor aiding the SDI in shooting down non-human craft, and quite the interesting
759000	764760	connection here. Possibly, these weapons against UFOs were accidentally discovered during the late
764760	772280	1940s. But now, let's get back to late March 1948 on top of the Hart Canyon Mesa. Consistent
772280	777560	across eyewitness statements ranging from the sources of Skully, Newton, and the Ramses are
777560	785720	reports of an enormous craft measuring 99.9 feet, resting virtually undamaged atop the Mesa at an
785720	792120	angle. Though crashed, could this saucer have landed on its own guidance? The saucer appeared
792120	798280	of a light metal composition, absent from any rivets, bolts, screws, signs of welding,
798280	804120	landing gear, or propulsion systems. In the middle of the bizarre craft sat what appeared to be a
804120	811320	crew cabin, an almost sphere measuring 18 feet in diameter and 6 feet in height. Locals from
811320	817560	Aztec and oilfield workers began to climb aboard the craft, remarking how light the material was.
817640	823000	In quickly on scene, witnesses described a helicopter flying overhead. The site was almost
823000	830040	surreal to eyewitnesses such as Doug Nolan, as the likely Sikorsky H-5 series or Bell H-13 was
830040	836440	quite new technology. Rapidly, men in uniform, unknown if army or air force, as the two were
836440	841880	recently separated, pulled to the scene in jeeps that were befitting of the US Army.
841880	846760	Multiple witness testimonies surrounding Aztec state the recovery effort was conducted out of
846760	852200	the USAF Walker Base in New Mexico. Allegedly, personnel were flown to Durango, Colorado,
852200	856840	where a short drive was completed to the crash site. This will be explored further later by
856840	863400	witnesses such as USAF Airmen known as pseudonym George, and Walker Air Force Base was the new name
863400	869880	for Roswell Army Airfield. The onsite military immediately separated citizens at the crash
869880	874520	site, informing them never to speak about the incident and informing the locals on scene.
874520	879080	The object was extremely important to US national security.
879080	883960	Now, Frank Scully's early 50s recount of Aztec, as informed by Silas Newton,
883960	889880	states investigators onsite were able to gain access to the craft via punctured porthole.
889880	895160	As investigators approached the seemingly glass like windows, they observed these portholes were
895160	901800	not glass, but indeed semi-translucent. Inside the craft, two humanoid bodies were
901800	907320	observed slumped over an instrument panel that appeared to be but four feet high, charred,
907320	913480	and possibly mangled. According to Scully, investigators jammed a wood or metal rod
913480	918280	into the mysteriously punctured porthole poking and prodding at the instrument panel
918280	924520	until a panel opened up giving access to the craft. Inside the vehicle appeared to be a separate
924600	930120	crew cabin where 12 to 14 separate bodies lay dead on the ground.
930120	934520	While the story of the crash, the retrieval process, and the method of gaining entry to
934520	939560	the craft are near identical, Steinman's account introduces far more specific,
939560	945800	such as named onsite scientific retrieval personnel. Steinman writes the 30 to 40-year-old
945800	951560	seasoned military members on scene were members of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, a long
951560	957560	forgotten US Army division shown to Steinman by the Freedom of Information Act to exist solely
957560	963240	through institutional memory. IPU has its own controversy and juicy alleged report in the
963240	969560	Majestic 12 leaks which we will address in a section specifically on IPU. According to Steinman's
969560	975640	sources, the impact area of the craft was relayed to Air Defense Commander General George C. Marshall,
975640	980680	who then contacted the IPU and head of the Majestic 12, the illustrious,
980680	985480	head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush.
986120	992840	Steinman first learned of the existence of IPU in the early 1980s so it is intriguing by 1986.
992840	998680	He had learned the IPU allegedly operated out of Camp Hale, Colorado and served the function
998680	1004920	to collect and deliver disabled or crashed disks to certain specific secret locations.
1004920	1011000	Now, Vannevar Bush in the M.J. 12. Bush is named Adnausium in the Majestic documents,
1011000	1017160	most famously the Eisenhower Briefing Document as M.J. 1, the head of the secret organization
1017160	1022360	created under President Harry Truman to act as the original UFO legacy program.
1022920	1029560	But Bush's ties to UFOs are not solely relegated to the Majestic documents. Later in this project,
1029560	1037000	we will discuss physicist and prodigy of Einstein, Robert A. Sarbacher, who claimed in 1950 UFO
1037000	1042680	programs were classified higher than the H-bomb and operated under Vannevar Bush. Keep an eye out
1042680	1049000	for this section later on. Accompanying Bush in the IPU was a team of eight other scientists we
1049000	1053960	will touch on when we cover in greater detail Steinman's work, but these included Dr. Robert
1053960	1060200	J. Oppenheimer, Dr. John von Neumann, and Dr. Detlev Bronk. Four of these men have been labeled
1060200	1067240	as original Majestic 12 members. On site, according to Steinman's work, the team accessed the craft
1067240	1073800	via punctured porthole. Inside the cabin sat two humanoid figures, with 12 more bodies littered
1073800	1081720	across the chamber. With Aztec, we do see varying reports of 12 to 16 bodies. Instrument panels
1081720	1087960	around the craft wall showed high-tech screens sprawled with glyphic-style writing. From Randy
1087960	1096200	Anderson to Mark's 1991 Deep Sea Recovery to 1965 Kexburg, glyphic iconography is inseparable
1096200	1102760	from non-human technology. A quote-unquote book was found inside the craft or better described as a
1102760	1109240	pamphlet of plastic displaying the same glyphic-style writing. General Marshall allegedly passed this
1109240	1114760	on to two leading cryptologists, William F. Freedman and Lambrose C. Calihamos,
1114760	1120680	who were unsuccessful in their attempts to decipher the codes. Physiologist and biophysicist
1120680	1126600	Dr. Detlev Bronk ordered the bodies to be placed on dry ice. According to Steinman's sources,
1126600	1132360	Air Research Corporation supplied freezing equipment as director of R&D of the corporation,
1132360	1138440	Dr. Paul A. Scherer was both a colleague of Vannevar Bush and a cryogenic specialist.
1139000	1144760	As a quick detour, I do find it rather fascinating in 1954 under the administration
1144760	1150520	of the recent presidential incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dr. Paul A. Scherer was one
1150520	1156040	of 12 scientists named onto the board of directors of a group called the American Association for
1156040	1161800	the Advancement of Science that sought radical changes in the scientific community. This panel
1161800	1167400	of esteemed scientists sought to harness global scientific advancements for humanity's progress
1167400	1173080	instead of preserving, quote, the secrecy of scientific knowledge we already have, end quote.
1173080	1179000	Seen as Dwight D. Eisenhower is often cited as the president who lost control of UFO legacy
1179000	1184680	programs, who ran an administration in which non-human crash retrieval and material exploitation
1184680	1190920	programs broke free from traditional oversight channels and gained unprecedented autonomy.
1190920	1196680	How fascinating is it that Dr. Paul A. Scherer, a scientist alleged to have participated in
1196680	1203640	non-human biologics retrieval in 1948, desperately sought to see the end of scientific secrecy
1203640	1208040	under the guise of national security following the Truman administration?
1208040	1213640	Dr. Bronk would allegedly go on to detail full autopsies for the pilots, which were published in
1213640	1220200	the legendary Ever Elusive and Deep Sixth Project Blue Book Slash Sign Report Number 13.
1220280	1226600	These bodies feature disproportionately large heads, slant eyes, small noses, and mouths.
1226600	1231880	The creatures weighed solely 40 pounds on average with small torsos and thin necks.
1231880	1237080	The fingers of the creatures were webbed and internal systems revealed no digestive systems
1237080	1243640	or gastrointestinal tracts, no alimentary or intestinal canal, and no reproductive organs.
1243640	1248440	Instead of blood, the circulatory system of the creatures was comprised of a colorless
1248440	1254840	liquid with no red cells that smelled like ozone. These creature descriptions sound near
1254840	1261640	identical to that of the EBE1 detailed in the controversial yet provocative 1950s Majestic
1261640	1266280	12 Special Operations Manual 1 I have covered in detail with Ryan Wood.
1266280	1271320	Now, I must mention here is where there are slight variances between Scully's and Steinman's
1271320	1276760	description of the biologics. Scully described the beans as almost perfectly humanoid,
1276840	1282760	just scaled differently with perfect teeth. The retrieval process of the crashed disc at Aztec
1282760	1287640	took up to two weeks. Helicopters certainly were unable to provide the necessary carrying
1287640	1294040	capacity to retrieve the 99.9-foot disc, so how in the world was it extracted?
1294040	1299400	These points here to me offer some of the most fascinating insights into Aztec.
1299400	1305320	Some non-human craft and incredible testimonies hurt decades after the Aztec event.
1305400	1310840	The craft was dismantled. The science team figured out the large ring of metal rotated
1310840	1316920	around the centralized, stabilized cabin. Indeed, the scientists were able to dismantle the craft.
1316920	1321960	The vehicle was manufactured in segments which fitted into grooves and were pinned together
1321960	1328840	around the base. The vehicle was divided into the crew cabin in three equal-sized pieces of the disc.
1329480	1332040	Now, stop me if you've heard this before.
1332600	1338280	Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security Agency
1338280	1343320	in the United States, deputy director at CIA, director of Naval Intelligence and a variety of
1343320	1349960	intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really accurate, that
1349960	1356440	there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man who had to know. So,
1356440	1362120	I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the UK.
1363080	1369880	And this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered under
1369880	1374040	national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have possession
1374040	1377960	of the hardware associated with this. In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon.
1377960	1379800	A craft, a spaceship.
1379800	1382120	Several of them, and they were in operational condition.
1382760	1387480	Bobby Ray Inman, one of if not the most critical figure to this channel,
1387480	1392840	served as director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, a four-star Navy Admiral,
1392840	1398040	director of Naval Intelligence, deputy director of Central Intelligence, director of the NSA,
1398040	1405640	and board member of SAIC Wackenhut and possibly DSAI. And Inman seems to connect to every project
1405640	1411400	I do these days. I have multiple videos where Inman is discussed at length, so I highly recommend
1411400	1417720	checking out any of these projects. Famously, in a 1989 recorded phone call with NASA mission
1417720	1423080	specialist Bob Echler, Inman volunteered CIA directorate of science and technology deputy
1423080	1429720	director and NRO program B director R. Everett Heineman as the person to ask about recovered
1429720	1435320	UFOs becoming available for technological research. Inman would additionally connect
1435320	1440360	Bob Echler with another former director of Naval Intelligence, Sumner Shapiro.
1440360	1446440	In 1989, Echler met Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with the quote-unquote
1446440	1453160	group that managed UFO information. At this time, Shapiro was retired as DNI and served as an
1453160	1458360	executive with BDM International. BDM, of course, is another former defense contractor
1458360	1463400	purchased by Northrop Grumman I have directly accused of being involved with the UFO Legacy
1463400	1469400	program operations. Shapiro informed Echler, factions within the U.S. possessed extraterrestrial
1469400	1475400	vehicles that he, Shapiro, had even studied at close quarters. According to the former DNI,
1475400	1479800	teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them around the country to different
1479800	1485720	laboratories. The craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an
1485720	1492040	exact sequence to be put back together. Was Shapiro talking about the Aztec case? After all,
1492040	1498680	in how many UFO crash retrieval cases do we hear of a craft being dismantled in a complex and
1498680	1505160	direct method? Let's also focus on this rotatable crew compartment. USAF Master Sergeant Edgar
1505160	1511400	Fouchet claimed the TR-3B alien reproduction vehicle whose propulsion systems were reverse-engineered
1511400	1517320	by Lawrence Livermore Labs and Sandia National Labs from non-human propulsion systems featured a
1517320	1523160	rotatable crew compartment within the triangle. The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring called
1523160	1528520	the magnetic field disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything
1528520	1533560	you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore laboratories developed a reverse
1533560	1539000	engineered MFD and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology
1540200	1542360	but you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you.
1543320	1549080	Anyways, after careful dismantling of the craft, multiple concrete pads still available to this
1549080	1556120	day were constructed to assist three M25 Dragon wagon tank transports which were stored in New
1556120	1562200	Mexico bases post-World War II. Indeed, the Ramses were able to find Bureau of Reclamation
1562200	1568200	records from 1948 discussing heavy earth moving equipment, cranes, and low-boys being used to
1568200	1574200	move concrete and steel structures in Aztec for the Manco's project. Mention of the Bureau of
1574200	1579720	Reclamation possibly supplying equipment for moving of the Aztec craft gives us means to pause
1579720	1585240	and reflect. Seen as in works prior, I have discussed tunneling contracts for tunnel boring
1585240	1590920	machines under the Bureau of Reclamation secretly engaging in clandestine operations to aid in
1590920	1596040	the construction of deep underground military bases in their alleged connective tunnel systems.
1596680	1602680	The convoy carrying enormous pieces of a disk avoided roads to Aztec and drove the wreckage
1602680	1608360	to Los Alamos National Labs. The bodies were transported away, likely to write patterns in
1608360	1614120	Air Force Base, and the craft remained at Los Alamos for over a year before being transported
1614120	1619800	again. The craft being shipped around serves as another nod to Shapiro, no? And quickly,
1619800	1625000	just in case you are unfamiliar with my other work, mention of Los Alamos as the first destination
1625000	1630760	for the craft is of massive consequence. I've previously discussed extensive ties with Los
1630760	1635800	Alamos National Labs, a Department of Energy federally funded research and development center,
1635800	1642280	and deep underground military bases, UFO legacy program gatekeepers, possible material exploitation
1642280	1648360	programs, etc. But relevant to today's discussion, let's look back to 1994 to the
1648360	1654920	words of former New Mexico State Representative J. Andrew Kistner. Kistner stated sources within
1654920	1660840	White Sands Proving Ground and the Naval Research Lab informed him that two to four flying disks
1660840	1667400	were recovered during 1947 and 1948, and the disks were possessed and analyzed by both
1667400	1673080	Los Alamos National Labs and Sandia National Labs 7th Division under control of the Atomic
1673080	1679320	Energy Commission. Kistner's sources claimed that institutions such as MIT, Brookhaven National
1679320	1684840	Labs, the Rand Corporation, and Joint Research and Development Board, created partly and shared
1684840	1691160	by Dr. Vannevar Bush, played a quote unquote major role following the 1947 crashes.
1691720	1695720	Additionally prudent to Aztec, Kistner mentioned Project Supremacy,
1695720	1702440	a possible UFO related program created in 1947 that operated specifically to track and perform
1702440	1709400	data acquisition on triangulated New Mexico radar sites. The New Mexico State Rep would even state
1709400	1716040	his sources claimed presidential executive order signed in 1948 allowed the Atomic Energy Commission
1716040	1721240	full custody of the recovered disks with the National Security Council serving as program
1721240	1726280	coordinator with support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Naval Research Laboratory,
1726280	1732520	and Dr. Bush's Research and Development Board. One might recall here how Dr. Eric Davis spoke
1732520	1738360	of PEEDS, a presidential emergency action document signed in the 50s by President Eisenhower to
1738360	1745320	structure UFO legacy program operations outside of congressional oversight. In fact, post-Roswell
1745320	1752520	early July 1947, leading up to the morning of 25 March 1948, we may have even more actionable
1752520	1757960	intelligence that signifies elements of the United States government and military were actively
1757960	1765560	engaging in establishing programs to deal with recovered non-human craft. On 29 January 1947,
1765560	1771960	Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy, original accused MJ12 member and
1771960	1779160	likely murder victim James V. Forestall, established AFSWP, the Armed Forces Special
1779160	1786200	Weapons Project. This AFSWP was tasked to manage nuclear weapons jointly staffed by U.S. Army and
1786200	1795000	Navy. At this time, the AFSWP operated within Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs. As we know
1795080	1803000	from the 2023 and 2024 UAPDA legislation, UFO data, materials, etc., have historically been
1803000	1810440	misclassified as trans-classified foreign nuclear information under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement.
1810440	1817080	This threat is indeed intriguing that possibly the AFSWP out of Los Alamos and Sandia handled
1817080	1822760	the wreckage of both the Roswell and Aztec crashes and served as the foundation out of which the
1822760	1829560	Atomic Energy Commission established a 1954 agreement to obfuscate and hide UFO data.
1830440	1835320	But now that we have covered the basis of the Aztec crash, let's really start to dive in.
1840440	1846360	The Aztec crash made its way into the public zeitgeist with Frank Scully's 1950 best-selling
1846360	1851560	book Behind the Flying Saucers. Though Scully had previously written about this incident in
1851560	1857640	1949 in two variety magazine columns, Behind the Flying Saucers served as a
1857640	1863240	second real book on flying saucers after Donald Keyhoe's Flying Saucers are real.
1863240	1868600	Scully's book truly served as the impetus for conversations between physicist and consultant
1868600	1874120	to Vannevar Bush's Research and Development Board Robert Sarbacher and Canadian radio engineer
1874120	1880120	Wilbert B. Smith that would ultimately lead to Canada's first two official programs on UFOs,
1880120	1885640	Project Magnet and Second Story. We will expand on this much later in the investigation,
1885640	1892120	and I also have an entire video on Sarbacher. But Wilbert B. Smith asking Sarbacher about
1892120	1897320	Frank Scully's best seller and how much of it was ultimately true led to one of the most
1897320	1902920	fascinating memos of all time. Sarbacher informs Smith that not only the contents of
1902920	1908440	Behind the Flying Saucers were fundamentally correct, but also that flying saucers exist.
1908440	1913880	The subject of UFOs is classified in the United States even higher than the H-bomb.
1913880	1919000	And efforts to capture and study UFOs were spearheaded by Vannevar Bush.
1919000	1924760	Scully's book reported the Aztec incident as we discussed prior. Besides the data from Steinman,
1924760	1931560	which we identified, Scully also reported that up to 1950 there had been four such recoveries.
1931560	1937400	Within the book, Scully suggested based on his plentiful sources, UFOs operated on magnetic
1937400	1943240	principles, and that finally brings us to Scully's sources, the linchpin of this entire video.
1944040	1950360	Scully's source of the Aztec crash was one Mr. Silas M. Newton, a complicated, questionable,
1950360	1956760	and intriguing character who requires ample time to investigate, as well as Mr. G,
1956760	1962520	an amalgamation of up to eight scientists. Newton claimed no first-hand experience with
1962520	1968280	the crash retrieval, bar-handling equipment retrieved, souvenirs claimed in pieces taken from
1968280	1974360	the crash. Newton's information came to him from his close, first-hand confidence, the enigmatic
1974360	1982440	Mr. G. Indeed, a 1952 debunk on Aztec attempted to label Mr. G as just one man, the equally
1982440	1989160	complicated Leo Gabauer, but this is simply not the case. Using the work of Suzanne and Scott Ramsey,
1989160	1994440	as well as William Steinman, we will actually attempt to name as many of the Mr. G's as
1994440	1999480	possible later in this investigation. After all, throughout the book, Scully would describe the
1999480	2005160	collection of G's as having, quote, more degrees than a thermometer, end quote. Scully and Newton
2005160	2010680	would take these names with them to the grave. Scully first heard of the Aztec event from Silas
2010680	2016840	Newton, owner of the Newton Oil Company with a truly checkered past. The two had a relationship
2016840	2022040	for multiple years, and early on when discussing flying saucers, Newton invited Scully to the
2022040	2027800	Mojave Desert to test an oil-finding device called a doodle bug that Newton would later
2027800	2033880	on face charges for, a fraudulent device that may just have more basis in reality than Hoke's
2033880	2039960	arguments would admit. Newton would introduce Scully to Dr. G, and Dr. G would tell Scully
2039960	2045320	much of what we had covered today, the recovery being intact, low salamos retrieving the vehicle,
2045320	2050840	the craft operated by magnetism, and that some sort of plastic pamphlet was found in the craft
2050840	2057640	with symbols that were not successfully deciphered. Dr. G infamously showed Scully a cube-like device
2057640	2063160	that admitted sounds like a radio, and small gear-like objects and discs that they claimed
2063160	2068600	originated from the Aztec craft, implying these men were actually at the crash site.
2068600	2073560	The men would even show Scully images of the craft, and keep this in mind as these images
2073560	2078680	will become important throughout the video, even Scully's widow claimed she had personally seen
2078680	2084360	these photographs. But Scully wasn't the first person to whom Silas Newton would disclose
2084360	2089960	information on Aztec. No, after receiving information about the crash from the enigmatic
2089960	2096120	pool of Mr. G, likely scientists with whom Newton had previously worked alongside in the oil industry,
2096120	2101640	and before the publishing of Behind the Flying Saucers, Newton had lectured on the crash event
2101640	2108920	at the University of Denver on 8 March 1950 under the pseudonym Scientist X. At this lecture,
2108920	2114520	Newton took the place of the original speaker, possibly a Mr. G, and discussed the flying saucer
2114520	2120440	crash in an effort to interest the students in UFOs. Thankfully, radio salesman and engineer
2120440	2126040	George Kohler from Denver KMYR who was friends with Newton and possibly some of the Mr. Gs
2126040	2131240	helped set up this event. Kohler investigated the lecture, and thanks to the Ramsay's keen
2131240	2136360	research skills, both the recording as well as items from Newton's drawings on the chalkboard
2136360	2142440	were found in Scully's archive. In this 1950 lecture, Newton discussed a crash of a flying
2142440	2149160	saucer that occurred two years prior in a 500 mile radius to Denver, drew details of the craft
2149160	2155000	seen on screen now, and discussed complex magnetism as the craft's propulsive force.
2155000	2159240	Clearly, this lecture did not go unnoticed, as the day after the lecture,
2159240	2164360	months before the release of Scully's bestseller, Air Force Office of Special Investigation visited
2164360	2171000	KMYR Denver looking for Kohler. After two days of trying, Kohler was interrogated by Special Agent
2171000	2176520	Hansen in Unger about Newton, flying saucers, possible cube-like radios retrieved from the
2176520	2182360	crash, and more. Thanks to the Ramsay's again for finding and reproducing this interrogation,
2182360	2187400	in a bizarre twist of events following Newton's lecture on the saucer and the release of behind
2187400	2192840	the flying saucers in September of 1950, multiple other U.S. agencies were tracking
2192840	2199720	leads and leaks on the Aztec crash. On 30 September 1950, the Army CID, or Criminal
2199720	2205080	Investigation Division, reported that a sting operation was staged at the Edelweiss Bar in
2205080	2211560	Melwyn Hotel in Denver. FBI and CID were trying to intercept the sale of photographs of the
2211560	2218280	Aztec saucer from one LD McLaughlin to Mr. Klein from the Baltimore Sun. The Ramsay's filed
2218280	2223720	Freedom of Information Act requests for more documents than the scant few we possess,
2223720	2229880	but were informed that all were destroyed, and in another fork in the road, there was no Mr. Klein
2229880	2235640	that worked for the Baltimore Sun at this time. So six months after Newton discussed the Aztec
2235640	2241880	crash at the University of Denver, the FBI and CID attempted to intercept photos of the crash,
2241880	2245080	and remember, Scully's widow claimed to see such photos.
2250280	2255400	Shortly after the release of behind the flying saucers, the case was at large labeled a hoax
2255400	2262120	due to a September 1952 publication by San Francisco Chronicle writer J. P. Kahn. Kahn
2262120	2266920	effectively killed the story by making the retrieval appear phony, discrediting Scully
2266920	2273720	in his most damaging act, discrediting Scully's sources, Newton and Dr. G. After all, around the
2273720	2280360	time of J. P. Kahn's article, Newton and one Dr. G, Leo Gabauer, who Kahn labeled as the singular
2280360	2286680	man behind Dr. G, were charged with defrauding Denver businessman Herman Flater. Around the use
2286680	2293320	of an oil-finding device we discussed called the Doodle Bug. This damning publication and context
2293320	2299160	around Kahn, Newton, and Gabauer's charges are well worth our time and analysis, as there is
2299160	2304440	far more here than meets the eye, including questioning the sourcing methods and honesty
2304440	2311720	of the hero of the hoax, J. P. Kahn. To quote the Ramses for decades, the 1948 Aztec crash
2311800	2317800	has looked like this quote. Frank Scully's story was going along great until a top shelf
2317800	2323320	journalist by the name of J. P. Kahn broke the big story of a bunch of Kahn men who had robbed
2323320	2328680	poor investors out of their life savings in a worthless oil scheme so that they were destitute
2328680	2335320	and standing in bread lines. Thank God for J. P. Kahn. He saved the day by exposing these Kahn men
2335320	2340680	who were taking in money and never paying a dime back. These horrible Kahn men were arrested and
2340760	2346440	sent off to jail, and the Aztec story was nothing more than a fiction concocted by a bunch of bad
2346440	2352360	and nasty crooks. End quote. While Newton is far from the only source and witness of Aztec,
2352360	2357960	the story has largely been marred and labeled a hoax due to Kahn's damning piece on Newton.
2357960	2364120	Predating behind the flying saucers, Scully and Kahn actually shared history. In 1949,
2364120	2369320	Kahn approached Scully when he got wind of the saucer story in Variety Magazine. Kahn wished to
2369320	2375560	capitalize off of the craze that was flying saucers. Kahn attempted to purchase the flying
2375560	2381000	saucer story for the San Francisco Chronicle from Scully in a disgraceful lowball.
2381000	2386360	The two failed to agree to terms with Scully defiantly resting on his laurels of the validity
2386360	2392200	of the story over any amount of money. Strangely, Kahn returned to the Chronicle claiming to his
2392200	2397720	superiors that he and Scully had actually agreed to terms. During these failed business
2397720	2403480	dealings, Scully had introduced Kahn to Newton at Scully's home. Kahn became almost obsessed with
2403480	2408600	Newton and the Aztec story, following Newton to San Francisco to get a one and a half hour
2408600	2413000	meeting with the oilman. Newton would write regarding the dinner with Kahn, quote,
2413000	2418440	the talk was saucers, saucers. The theme of their talk was that I owed something to the world and
2418440	2424760	I should let the Chronicle guide me end quote. End quote. The meeting lasted one and a half hours.
2424760	2429480	They wanted their great conservative paper to get to the bottom, document the whole thing,
2429480	2435320	and if they thought it was true, then give it to the world, end quote. Ironically, Newton also said,
2435320	2441000	quote, they would satisfy anyone that they would protect the identity of all concerned, end quote.
2441640	2446600	Kahn would fully turn his story pitch away from Scully towards Newton, wishing for Newton to
2446680	2455640	assemble the entire roster of Dr. G for $25,000 in 1952 money in 50% royalties in any publication.
2455640	2459720	Kahn would famously state in his debunk that during these meetings with Newton,
2459720	2465480	Silas showed him quote unquote gears from the crash site. But dubiously, Kahn would steal one of
2465480	2471480	these pieces, have it tested, and determine the relic was simply common aluminum. Now as it turns
2471480	2476920	out, these pieces from a saucer given to Newton were indeed copies, and while Newton and Scully
2476920	2481560	had more than likely seen the real collection of items from Dr. G, the items in Newton's
2481560	2487560	possessions were little more than replicas. This approach by Newton does make logical sense here.
2487560	2494440	Recall in 1950, AFOSI interrogating radio salesman Kohler about parts from a flying saucer the day
2494440	2500680	after Newton's University of Denver lecture. In addition, recall how the FBI and Army CID were
2500680	2507560	actively hunting Aztec photos. JP Kahn would, as a nail in the coffin to Aztec, label one Mr.
2507560	2514840	Leo Gabauer as the sole Dr. G and implicate the two men in oil fraud. So before we move on to this
2514840	2521320	criminal case that effectively shredded Newton, Scully, Dr. G, and Aztec, let's go ahead and
2521320	2527400	dive into Gabauer. Leo A. Gabauer was a phoenix based physical scientist that specialized in
2527400	2533000	magnetics. Gabauer was a known associate and friend of Newton, and one of the inventors
2533000	2538120	refers to harness the oil-finding devices infamously called the Doodle Bug.
2538120	2543560	Now quickly, I have seen some reports that state Newton and Gabauer claimed the Doodle Bug operated
2543560	2549240	off of non-human technology recovered at Aztec. I have never seen any of these statements from
2549240	2555400	Newton, Gabauer, or Scully that claim this. In fact, the Doodle Bug seemingly has far more basis
2555400	2561880	in scientific reality that we will discuss soon. In his debunked piece, Kahn defiantly stated Gabauer
2561880	2567960	was the sole Dr. G and Newton had informed him of such. The basis for this claim, none.
2568760	2575080	Gabauer would continuously state in writing, sworn in court, etc., that he was not Dr. G,
2575080	2581960	so Gabauer was not the Mr. G, but was he a Mr. G? This point is extremely interesting,
2581960	2587240	as Gabauer may have been in fact one of the Dr. G's relaying information to Newton,
2587240	2590680	but like everything with this story, nothing is so simple.
2590680	2596920	In 1986, Steinman would suggest Gabauer and Newton were a targeted leak of information from
2596920	2603560	none other than a real Dr. G, Majestic 12 member, and scientist on site for the Aztec crash,
2603560	2609320	Dr. Carl A. Highland. Dr. Highland was the founder and owner of the Highland Research
2609320	2614200	and Exploration Company based in Denver. Highland was born in Hamburg, Germany, attended the
2614200	2620120	universities of Heidelberg and Hamburg, gaining his directorate in the latter in 1923,
2620120	2625960	destined for a career in geology and geophysics. Highland came to the US in 1935,
2625960	2630280	where he worked as a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines,
2630280	2635400	and operated within the nearby oil fields. During his time in Colorado, Highland worked
2635480	2640520	alongside many of the scientists we will discuss in this chapter, and more than likely engaged
2640520	2646360	with Leo Gabauer for work on magnetic detection devices as well as successful Denver-based
2646360	2652200	oil man Silas M. Newton. Some even suggest Highland was originally the scientist X,
2652200	2657480	supposed to speak at the 1950 University of Denver lecture until Newton took his place.
2658120	2663480	Researchers outside of Steinman have come to the same conclusion, such as one Richard Ogden,
2663480	2668840	who wrote in his 1960s unpublished book that he deduced the field of scientist who could in
2668840	2675400	fact be Dr. G, based on Solly's description and arrived at one Dr. Carl A. Highland.
2675400	2680280	After all, Scully would state one of the Mr. G's lived in Denver and was able to fly to
2680280	2685880	the Aztec crash site in two or three hours and that Newton drove with him from Denver to Phoenix.
2686440	2691880	But let's get back to Scully, Newton, Kahn, Gabauer, and the story of the court case.
2691880	2696600	After failing to purchase the saucer story from Scully and Newton, being duped by the
2696600	2703000	copy parts after stealing from Silas, and whether malice or ignorance falsely labeled Dr. G as one
2703000	2709960	Leo Gabauer, J.P. Kahn acted on his vendetta to destroy the Aztec story, both on paper and behind
2709960	2716600	the scenes. This can be confirmed in a 15 June 1952 letter from Scully to the attorney of Silas
2716600	2722840	M. Newton, A. Brigham Rose. The letter discusses Kahn approaching Scully in 1949 when he got
2722840	2729160	wind of Aztec from Scully's Variety Magazine article. By 1951, Kahn had tried and failed
2729160	2734360	repeatedly to purchase the story. Kahn quickly became obsessed with Newton and admitted to
2734360	2740280	Scully he had stolen Newton's replica craft material and replaced it with slug. The letter
2740280	2747000	additionally stated by late 1951, Kahn visited Scully saying he had been duped, claiming Newton
2747000	2752520	and G were to be arrested, that he wanted the hoax exposed and to be written under Scully's name,
2752520	2756680	otherwise they would accuse Scully of being involved in the hoax as well.
2756680	2765320	On 25 April 1951, J.P. Kahn wrote to J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI regarding Silas Newton.
2765320	2770440	The letter stated that Newton had leaked the Aztec case to Scully and that he was a man with
2770440	2776680	a checkered criminal history. Kahn also tipped off Hoover that Newton was engaged in the preparation
2776680	2783160	of a hoax or swindle of large proportions. Strangely enough, the director of the FBI found
2783160	2790440	time to reply by 3 May 1951 stating the FBI was, quote, to determine if Newton is violating
2790440	2795160	federal statutes in claiming to be engaged in government research of a secret nature
2795160	2800280	or in the perpetration of a hoax or swindle of large proportions, end quote.
2800280	2806920	By 15 May 1951, Kahn responded to Hoover alerting that director information had been made available
2806920	2813080	to FBI special agents regarding Newton's activities. Now, I find it extremely odd the
2813080	2819320	director of the FBI would find time to reply to a San Francisco Chronicle writer within a month.
2819320	2824840	Perhaps as FBI and CID were conducting sting operations to intercept Aztec photographs
2824840	2831240	in 1950, the bureau was keen to chase down any leads surrounding the Aztec case.
2831240	2837320	After all, the FBI did have a bizarre file on Newton written roughly one year prior on 31
2837320	2843800	March 1950. This letter also written to Hoover stated that allegedly a redacted name was told
2843800	2850760	to have said to another redacted man, Silas Newton, aka Mr. X, had knowledge of a flying disc in
2850760	2856440	recovered bodies. Some of the details here are incorrect, of course. However, it is intriguing
2856440	2862120	the FBI was already keeping tabs on Newton just a few short weeks after his Denver lecture on
2862120	2868040	saucers. And just a few short weeks after, AFOSI interrogated the man who recorded the
2868040	2874120	lecture, George Kohler. I also find it equally fascinating Scott and Suzanne Ramsey pried
2874120	2882760	289 pages of Silas Newton documents from the FBI, yet the bureau claimed 100 plus pages were still
2882760	2888360	unreleasable. The FBI did register multiple documents on Newton before Khan got to them.
2888360	2895560	One file dated 18 February 1941 reported that, quote, Silas Newton had a very substantial income,
2895560	2900840	good character, good habits, and no record of lawsuit, collections, or bankruptcy. Both his
2900840	2905880	companies were reputable concerns, and there was no indication of espionage activities,
2905880	2912120	end quote. Now of course, the time period of FBI and J. Edgar Hoover investigating Newton
2912120	2919800	does encourage us to reflect on the 1950 HODL memo. On 22 March 1950, J. Edgar Hoover received an
2919800	2925160	official memorandum from Washington Special Agent Guy HODL concerning information on flying
2925160	2931800	saucers. The memo discussed information relayed to Special Agent R. H. Kurtzman by police Special
2931800	2937720	Investigator Carl Howe and his unnamed informant. According to the memo, an Air Force investigator
2937720	2943240	stated three flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico, measuring 50 feet in diameter with
2943240	2949800	raised centers, manned by humanoid biologics that measured three feet tall dressed in metallic cloth
2949800	2955560	of a very fine texture. These saucers were apparently found in New Mexico due to high-powered
2955560	2961400	radar setup in New Mexico interfering with saucer mechanisms. Until this memo was released fully
2961400	2966120	redacted, many thought the source of this information was Newton. While the memo discussed
2966120	2972600	crafts similar to Aztec, albeit off-dimension-wise, it is intriguing to continuously hear descriptions
2972600	2978360	of high-powered radar interfering with craft mechanics. Anyways, I digress.
2978360	2984680	Khan's outreach to the FBI was very successful. Khan additionally located one Herman Flater,
2984680	2990760	a Denver businessman who had a series of successful, poor, and speculative business deals.
2990760	2995400	Flater had invested large sums of money into Newton's oil wells, which paid him pretty
2995400	3001160	handsome royalties. And the doodle bug, Flater was convinced would make him millions of dollars.
3001160	3006120	Recall the doodle bug was a term used for an electronic sensing equipment device used to
3006120	3011080	find oil, gas, water, and whatever else the inventor claimed the unit could locate.
3011640	3016840	Khan told Flater, quote, you will never see a nickel of your investment because you,
3016840	3022360	my friend, have been victim of a Khan artist, end quote. This quote was reported in Frank
3022360	3027720	Scully's book, Armor Bright. Over his dealings with Khan, Flater was convinced the two men
3027720	3034200	should seek the FBI to pursue legal action against Newton. In 1951, Flater eventually
3034200	3039240	wished, with the aid of the FBI, to file a criminal case against Newton in his compatriot
3039240	3046520	of the doodle bug, Leo Gabauer. As he decided, he felt hustled out of 250 grand by the two men.
3046520	3052600	Again odd, as Flater was actively receiving royalties from Newton's successful oil fields.
3052600	3056840	Flater would claim that every time Gabauer utilized the doodle bug machine,
3056840	3062520	he had positive results. However, every time Flater would use the device, nothing happened.
3062600	3068920	Curiously, the FBI could not find one federal judge to entertain a federal criminal case in
3068920	3074920	Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, all states in which Newton conducted business.
3074920	3079320	Flater's attorney eventually went to a magistrate in Denver to prosecute the case
3079320	3085880	locally, and charges were filed on 10 October 1952. The initial charges levied at Newton in
3085880	3091320	Gabauer was, quote, interstate transportation of stolen property, end quote, which was defined
3091320	3097080	as Newton transporting Herman Flater's personal checks across state lines to California to deposit
3097080	3102440	them into his bank account. The next charges levied were quote unquote worthless machinery,
3102440	3109640	which led to the arrest of Gabauer in Phoenix and Newton in Los Angeles on 18 October 1952.
3109640	3116200	Whilst building the case, the FBI found 32 of 33 of Newton and Gabauer's investors were quite
3116280	3120840	pleased with their investments. Flater was the standout pressing charges.
3120840	3127720	The trial started on 10 November 1953, and proceedings lasted until 29 December 1953,
3127720	3133400	when Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer were found guilty of fraud. Based on the work of William
3133400	3139560	Steinman analyzing court records, it is crucial to analyze how this case was prosecuted.
3139560	3144760	Disgruntled businessman Herman Flater was the first prosecution witness to take the stand,
3144760	3150360	presenting his main complaint as his, quote, inability to operate Gabauer's oil detecting
3150360	3155720	device, end quote. Flater's testimony lasted two weeks, and again, he felt as though Newton
3155720	3164120	and Gabauer defrauded him of $250,000. On 17 November 1953, the defense for Gabauer presented,
3164120	3169800	as evidence, a signed contract by Flater that gave him interest in three of the oil detecting
3169800	3175080	devices in return for his investment. Flater strangely denied signing these documents,
3175080	3179240	however, eyewitnesses testified to observing Flater's sign.
3179240	3186440	On 20 November 1953, prosecution called Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Professor Dr. James
3186440	3191560	Meredith to the stand. Meredith was asked as an expert in geophysical exploration,
3191560	3196760	if he could prove Gabauer's doodle bugs were legitimate tools. Meredith was shown a device
3196760	3203000	that was, quote, unquote, very similar to Gabauer's oil detecting tool, but not his device.
3203000	3208280	The device presented in court was one that the district attorney had purchased at a local war
3208280	3215960	surplus store for $4.45 and was, quote, very similar to the one Gabauer used, end quote.
3215960	3220760	The Colorado School of Mines doctor testified regarding the false instrument, quote,
3220760	3227160	these so-called doodle bugs couldn't detect submarines, much less oil and or gas deposits,
3227160	3232200	end quote. A second witness, this time a research engineer for the University of Denver,
3232200	3238520	examined the same knockoff devices and testified that it, quote, couldn't find anything, end quote.
3238520	3244200	Now let's also take a look at the defense here. Defense attorney Melman served Flater with a subpoena,
3244200	3249400	ordering Flater to produce a small health machine he supposedly produced and sold part
3249400	3255640	interest into Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer. So in the same exchange of interest here to this court
3255640	3261320	case, Flater was buying into the oil detecting device, but Flater was also trying to sell Newton
3261320	3267480	and Gabauer on a nebulous, quote unquote, health machine. The judge bizarrely decided that this
3267480	3273160	health machine was not relevant to the case. The second witness called by defense testified
3273160	3279240	with photo evidence that Gabauer had successfully located three water wells on his company property.
3279480	3285720	Additional witnesses claimed Gabauer's device had successfully found oil on their 100,000 acre
3285720	3293400	land, quote, Mr. Gabauer's machine defined 35 oil wells for me. Earlier this year, 1953,
3293400	3301240	I sold 89% in one of these wells for $1.75 million, end quote, testified oil Tejon field
3301240	3307080	ranch owner Horace Steele, quote, I drilled two wells on my own initiative after Mr. Gabauer told
3307080	3312760	me not to. On the basis of surveys taken by his machine, both of these wells turned out dry.
3312760	3319320	I paid Gabauer $10,000 for the complete survey. It was worth every penny, end quote. Mind you,
3319320	3324680	according to court records, JP Kahn was on the sideline assisting every step of the way with
3324680	3332120	the prosecution of Gabauer and Newton. In a rather bizarre twist on 18 December 1953, prosecution
3332120	3338280	called Thor Severson, a Denver Post reporter. Severson had attended Newton's March 1953
3338280	3344040	university lecture on flying saucers. According to court records, Severson showed a now famous
3344040	3349880	photograph displaying Scully, Newton, and George Kohler and claimed without evidence this meeting
3349880	3356520	conspiratorially discussed oil detecting devices. The confusing trial of Newton and Gabauer eventually
3356600	3363000	came to an end. The two were found guilty of fraud and faced up to 30 years in prison, but
3363000	3369960	the case evaporated. The men were never sentenced and faced no fines. Curiously, Newton agreed to
3369960	3377800	pay a sum of $18,000 to cover court costs, as though this was a civil case, not criminal prosecution.
3378360	3384120	But the damage was done. The Aztec story was officially dead and buried. Kahn's conquest
3384120	3389000	of vengeance had been successful. Even though upon his passing, manager of Kahn's estate,
3389000	3394200	Robert McClay, produced cover art for Kahn's attempts to push more flying saucer stories in
3394200	3401400	the 1960s. With the facts of this case, one must ask why were Newton and Gabauer even charged?
3401400	3406760	Scott and Suzanne Ramsey argue this court case was punishment to Newton for introducing Dr.
3406760	3413080	G to Scully, wasting Newton's time delivering him stress and draining him of tremendous amounts of
3413080	3419000	money. Closer to modern day, many who disclose information on UFO crash retrievals or alien
3419000	3424680	reproduction vehicles face similar reprisals. These include Jonathan Weigant and Mark McCandelish,
3424680	3429000	both of whom were craftily targeted by the IRS after their disclosures.
3429640	3435240	Now after that entire long-winded court case section, and before we move on, we must discuss a
3435240	3441960	never-finished autobiography dated 1954 written by Newton and found within the Scully archive by
3442040	3448600	Scott and Suzanne Ramsey. Quickly, let's recap what we know about Newton. Newton was born 19 July
3448600	3454600	1897 and earned a bachelor degree at Baylor, studied at Yale, and performed postgraduate work
3454600	3459560	at the University of Berlin. Newton became a successful oil entrepreneur because of his
3459560	3465320	background as a geophysicist who studied petroleum under the earth. The oil man's relationships
3465320	3470920	would lead him to connect with Leo Gabauer and Dr. G, where Newton both likely heard about the Aztec
3470920	3477400	crash and prototype oil-fighting devices. Newton would disclose data of the crash alongside Dr. G
3477400	3483160	to Frank Scully and even take the place of a lecturer at the University of Denver in 1950.
3483160	3489000	Newton is also a convicted, but never sentenced con man, and as we discussed, there is more than
3489000	3494680	meet the eye to his court case. But what did Newton have to write about himself? Within the
3494680	3499800	manuscript, Newton wrote openly about his friendship with Gabauer and did in fact have a business
3499800	3505240	deal that went south with Denver businessman Herman Flater. Newton saw his University of Denver
3505240	3511080	lecture as the focal point of his entire story. Indeed, the manuscript shows Newton had a deep
3511080	3516200	fascination of magnetics and displayed both an admirable effort to understand the history of
3516200	3522920	magnetism as well as strong conviction flying saucers did indeed operate off of magnetic principles.
3522920	3527960	Again, Newton recounted how he originally was not supposed to speak at this lecture.
3527960	3533800	One of the quote-unquote men of science, likely comprising Dr. G, was to be the lecturer.
3533800	3539880	quote, some four years ago, I dared to stand before an audience in a so-called hall of learning
3539880	3544360	and tell a packed body of students a story I had heard about a phenomenon on which
3544360	3549480	are guardians of space. The Air Force, together with the Air Force of Canada and Great Britain
3549480	3555400	and other nations, have spent millions trying to identify what they term unidentified aerial
3555400	3561080	objects. They also call it quote-unquote project blue book to give it a proper cloak of mystery
3561080	3566600	here in the USA, end quote. Newton defiantly stated regarding the lecture quote,
3566600	3571960	as to my talk, it wasn't long before the finger of prosecution began pointing my way
3571960	3576520	and they've scorched my hide already, but I haven't recanted, end quote.
3576520	3582520	And while on the subject, a quick note here is well worth referencing. In the 1970s, UFO
3582520	3588840	investigator and former CIA officer Carl Flock claimed to have obtained a diary kept by Silas Newton.
3589800	3594280	This diary allegedly discussed Newton revealing that in the early 1950s,
3594280	3599480	he was contacted by US military officials who wished to speak to him about Aztec.
3599480	3605240	Newton was told the military knew the Aztec story to be bogus. However, they still wished him to
3605240	3611320	spread the story far and wide to whoever would listen. Flock never produced this diary and after
3611320	3617000	unrelenting pursuit by Scott Ramsey, admitted his source for this diary was Newton's nephew.
3617000	3623320	Now, Newton's sons were both still alive at this time, so one might ask why Newton's nephew would
3623320	3629240	be in possession of the diary. But nevertheless, Flock never produced material evidence of these
3629240	3635080	statements. But back to Newton's manuscript, Silas recalled his tarring and feathering with a
3635080	3640920	rather melancholic tone, writing quote, when the day comes and one of the silent invaders of our
3640920	3646600	skies sets down and we are greeted by the people of another planet. I'm wondering if they too will
3646600	3652120	be stoned in the marketplace. Me thinks they already know our ways and ere they do visit us,
3652120	3656760	they'll be in a position to protect themselves against our gangster methods and our shoot first
3656760	3662280	and investigate afterwards system, end quote. In the manuscript, Newton would discuss how
3662280	3668280	Canadian radio engineer Wilbur B Smith had his complete and unwavering admiration for studying
3668680	3674760	saucer magnetic propulsion. And this revelation is enormous and we will soon relate it to Sarbacher.
3674760	3680600	Newton's fascination with magnetics makes perfect sense when we piece together that likely before
3680600	3686840	World War Two, Newton knew select oil and gas scientists who went into top secret work for
3686840	3693160	Vannevar Bush during World War Two. These scientists, as we will discuss soon, would have been an
3693160	3700520	ideal team to study downed UFO saucers found during 1947 to 1950 and Newton would have
3700520	3706200	likely stayed in touch with them to assist in the development of magnetic anomaly detection devices
3706200	3712760	or MADS that were then and still are called doodle bugs and possibly receive first hand
3712760	3719400	information on UFO crash retrievals along the way. Indeed, according to the Aztec UFO incident,
3719480	3725160	a separate 1950 wire recording archived at the University of Washington saw Newton speak of
3725160	3731800	doing magnetic research in the Mojave Desert with a top magnetic scientist in 1949. In this
3731800	3737080	recording, Newton recalled mentioning reading about flying saucers to the scientist, to which
3737080	3742120	the scientist retorted that he had driven from Denver to Phoenix and when he drove past New
3742120	3747400	Mexico, he thought he wished Silas Newton was there so he could show Newton where the saucer
3747400	3753160	had landed. According to Newton, the scientist recalled the Rocky Plateau northeast of Aztec
3753160	3759480	and how they, the scientists in the military, had arrived from Durango, Colorado. Miraculously,
3759480	3765240	I do believe I have found this exact wire, or one similar recorded three March 1950,
3765240	3771240	so let's listen to Silas himself. In the summer of 1949, while engaged in
3771880	3775480	magnetic research in the Mojave Desert in California,
3777880	3786360	I was driving one day with one of my associates who happens to be rated the top
3786360	3793800	magnetic scientist of the United States. In conversation with this gentleman,
3794760	3806680	I had occasion to mention a report about flying saucers. I said,
3806680	3813720	Dr, do you happen to know anything about them? His answer was starting. He said to me,
3815160	3819800	he said, I thought about you last week when I came down from Denver to Phoenix.
3820040	3829000	When I passed Aztec, New Mexico, I said to my wife, I wish Silas was here,
3830040	3835240	because I would take him out and show him where the first flying saucer landed
3836280	3843400	in the United States. I said, Dr, do you mean to tell me that one of these ships landed
3844360	3847320	and that the American people don't know anything about it?
3849240	3863160	He said, two telescopes saw this flying saucer or an unidentified ship, and
3863480	3873640	they watched its position on the telescope and estimated approximately where it would land.
3875720	3888680	Within two to three hours after the landing, our force officials reached the flying field
3888680	3902040	at Durango and took off in their search for this object. When they found it, it was in a
3902680	3910680	very rocky, high plateau territory about 16 miles east of Aztec, New Mexico.
3911000	3924200	They immediately threw a guard around it, and about seven of our magnetic group of scientists
3925000	3935080	were called in to examine this strange ship. Now, before we move on, I leave you with this
3935080	3939080	powerful quote on page 228 from Newton's manuscript.
3965800	3971000	I have, however, not only been libeled and lied about, but I have been pictured as the deliberate
3971000	3976680	author of the whole idea. And to follow it up, the same people who defamed me in print
3976680	3982360	then framed up a prosecution that even at this hour seems to me like some horrible nightmare
3982360	3993960	from which I will awaken in time. The Ramses and myself share the sentiment the trial of Newton
3994600	4000760	was targeted retaliation for leaking information about the Aztec case. William Steinman presents
4000760	4005800	a far more dramatic and consequential reason for the court case of Newton and Gebauer. These
4005800	4010840	conclusions will also lead us to discuss in depth the doodle bug, which may just be the
4010840	4018120	linchpin of the whole case, tying in together Aztec, Mr. G, Newton, Scholle, Gebauer, and possibly
4018120	4023560	the Majestic Twelve. Recall how Steinman's investigation and sources led him to conclude
4023560	4030200	Dr. Carl A. Highland was not only one of the real Mr. G's, but also an MJ-12 member and
4030200	4036440	first-hand participant of the Aztec UFO crash. Dr. Carl Highland owned the Highland Research
4036440	4041880	and Exploration Company based in Denver, Colorado. Steinman claims Highland's business was quite
4041880	4047080	familiar with devices used for detecting oil wells and water, and that Gebauer had even
4047080	4052600	consulted with Highland's company. Steinman's theory goes Highland and Gebauer sought ways to
4052600	4058200	test modified and developed magnetic aerial detection equipment from World War II, anti-summering
4058200	4065160	programs, and thus the two engaged with oil man Silas Newton. In fact, Steinman argued Highland
4065160	4071400	and Gebauer were not only acquaintances, but also research compatriots. In his book, Steinman and
4071400	4078280	Furs, Gebauer, and Highland worked and lived together in 1935 in Antarctica for a US government
4078280	4083400	research project. According to the researcher, the two would later be involved with top secret
4083400	4088840	development of magnetic aerial detection, anti-summering technology, and then post-war,
4088840	4095240	adapt such technology back to underground oil, gas, water, and or other detection.
4095240	4100120	I should, however, note that Steinman does not offer exhibits of evidence or context around
4100120	4105000	these statements, so while I have no reason to doubt him here, we still cannot prove Highland
4105000	4112120	and Gebauer 100% worked and lived alongside one another. Furthermore, Steinman would also claim
4112120	4117560	Gebauer worked at the Phoenix and Los Angeles Division of Air Research Company. Recall how
4117560	4123160	Air Research Company and its founder, Dr. Paul Sherer, a colleague of Vannevar Bush and member
4123160	4127640	of the Research and Development Board, was allegedly called to action to provide freezing
4127640	4133720	equipment to preserve the Aztec bodies. Another interesting connection that I find
4133720	4138200	little to back up, however, it should be mentioned the Ramses additionally stated
4138200	4143800	Gebauer had served high positions within the Air Research Laboratories around 1946,
4143800	4149560	according to Better Business Bureau records. But back to Highland, Highland was involved in
4149560	4155160	early uses of the magnetometer for both geophysical exploration purposes and for detecting
4155160	4161400	submarines during World War II. Steinman argued Highland was the initial source of the Aztec leak,
4161400	4167320	disclosing information, photographs, materials, etc. to Newton and Gebauer.
4167320	4172680	When the Majestic 12 or whatever UFO legacy program entity was controlling dissemination
4172680	4178760	of information around this time found out, Highland was forced to withdraw from the March 1950
4178760	4183720	University of Denver lecture where scientist X, Silas Newton, took his place.
4209720	4213480	Highland explained to his visitor that he could not do so with a clear conscience
4213480	4218680	and look Gebauer in the eye knowing that they had both developed these devices together.
4220040	4225880	This ultimately, according to the theory, led to Dr. James Meredith, a co-worker of Highland at
4225880	4232840	the Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Department, to testify against Gebauer with fraudulent devices.
4232840	4238200	Recall how Steinman connected the doodle bug with World War II submarine detecting equipment.
4238200	4243240	This is where our story gets incredibly strange and perhaps there is more to the
4243240	4249080	inappropriately named doodle bug than meets the eye. Remember, several witnesses testified in
4249080	4254360	support of Gebauer and Newton that their device was indeed successful at finding oil or water
4254360	4260120	deposits. Gebauer's device, if real, may have been an early iteration of a magnetic anomaly
4260120	4265640	detection device or MAD and this device, like Steinman proposed, could have connected Gebauer
4265640	4271720	and Newton to the Aztec saucer. Newton and Gebauer, as stated in Newton's never-finished autobiography,
4271720	4276840	were familiar with scientists before the Second World War who were working on finding oil-finding
4276840	4282440	devices that transitioned to work under Vannevar Bush for secretive submarine detection missions
4282440	4288120	in both theaters of World War II. After all, according to Scully, the Dr. G scientists were
4288120	4293400	quote unquote top shelf and worked on secretive projects during the Second World War. Scully
4293400	4298920	additionally labeled some of the Dr. Gs as working out the means by which Japanese submarines were
4298920	4305320	detected by magnetic devices. So let's really pull on this thread here. In 1930, a company was
4305320	4313400	founded by Dr. J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott called Geophysical Services Inc. quote,
4313400	4319320	Karcher was an American geophysicist and businessman who invented the reflection Seismograph applying
4319320	4325240	for patents in 1919. He eventually commercialized the process by which most of the world's oil
4325240	4331480	reserves were discovered. McDermott was a geophysicist and pioneer of providing seismic services to the
4331480	4338680	petroleum industry. The original GSI was founded in 1930 to offer the first ever reflection Seismograph
4338680	4345480	exploration services to the oil industry, end quote. In 1917, when John Karcher revealed his
4345480	4351000	formula for calculating the depth of subsurface formations, he knew he had developed something
4351000	4357800	very important. His discovery led to a plan for someday using seismic waves to map structures
4357800	4364360	far below the earth's surface. The oil producing world would come to know the reflection Seismograph
4364360	4369800	as the instrument which fulfilled that plan. I do not think it is any stretch here to assume
4369800	4376520	GSI sought prolific and successful oil men in the American Southwest like Silas Newton to test
4376520	4382760	their groundbreaking products. By 1939, the founders of GSI started another company which
4382760	4389320	acted as GSI's parent company called the Colorado Corporation. The purpose here was to keep GSI in
4389320	4395080	the reflection Seismograph business exploring oil and gas whilst the Colorado Corps could continue
4395080	4402840	to branch into new ventures. By 1941, Eugene McDermott along with several key employees purchased GSI
4402840	4408760	from Colorado Corp. Immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor, GSI and the reflection
4408760	4414120	seismograph technologies were recruited to secretive projects for anti-summarine warfare.
4414840	4420120	The National Defense Research Council was setting up the organizations through which university
4420120	4426280	and industry people were to be pulled together to tackle specific jobs in technology and design
4426280	4434600	for the war effort. GSI had a hidden asset, its long experience in building sophisticated
4434600	4440920	electronic equipment for its own use. This experience and Johnson's frequent trips to
4440920	4445560	Washington led to some engineering and development tasks for the Army Signal Corps
4446280	4450440	and a contract for airborne magnetic submarine detectors for the Navy.
4450440	4457880	By 1942, GSI had become a DOD contractor in Navy war production engineering, specifically focused
4457880	4463640	on using their technology for submarine detection. GSI was recruited by the Office of Scientific
4463640	4468680	Research and Development, an office set up by the US government during World War II to quote,
4468680	4474600	engage the brightest scientific minds and the great machinery of industry in the pursuit of victory
4474600	4482360	and quote, the head of this OSRD was of course accused MJ1 and lead scientist for the Aztec crash,
4482360	4489560	Dr. Vannevar Bush. Working under Vannevar Bush, the OSRD and Navy War Department, GSI was divided
4489560	4495240	into four groups, the Laboratory Manufacturing Division, Apparatus Division, Equipment Group,
4495240	4501880	and Defense Systems and Electronics Group, aka DSEG. So hold on here and let's get this straight.
4501880	4508520	GSI was developing oil detecting devices used possibly by Silas M. Newton before being recruited
4508520	4514680	in World War II by Dr. Vannevar Bush and the OSRD in order to adapt their technology for
4514680	4521320	anti-submarine programs. This ties in perfectly to the statements made by Steinman and Scully
4521320	4528920	in their publishing. But that's not all here and far from it. GSI would later on in 1951 become
4528920	4534920	Texas Instruments, a contractor accused of housing UFO legacy program operations.
4534920	4541720	It is comical to me how Texas Instruments themselves refer to legendary GSI geophysicists,
4541720	4548440	geologists, engineers, scientists, and others who performed seismic survey tasks as doodlebuggers.
4549160	4554760	But as GSI sounds like a perfect corporation that fits the description of the workplace of one,
4554760	4560840	if not multiple Mr. G's, are there any former GSI employees that really fit our conditions?
4561480	4568120	One possible source of Dr. G was GSI co-founder Eugene McDermott. McDermott was a luminary and
4568120	4574040	genius, himself registering five of the early GSI patents that greatly earned the respect of
4574040	4580360	Vannevar Bush. If Bush did indeed spearhead the Aztec retrieval, a trusted and respected genius
4580360	4585800	like McDermott would make an obvious candidate for a scientist on the team. McDermott was active
4585800	4592840	with GSI since its inception in the 1930s, when GSI was largely working with oil and gas detection,
4592840	4597960	possibly working in allowing Newton and Gebauer to test their technologies.
4597960	4603000	McDermott was revered by his employees, such as Cecil Green, who would go on to serve as
4603000	4608520	president and chairman when GSI became Texas Instruments. In a comical statement relevant
4608520	4614760	to the subject of UFOs, according to Green, McDermott had extreme skills in reverse engineering
4614760	4621560	almost anything he was given. The co-founder of GSI, J. Clarence Karcher, makes an additional
4621560	4628200	possibility for a Mr. G, as he originally applied for patents in reflection seismology in 1921.
4628200	4633880	According to an engraved monument, quote, proved the validity of the reflection seismograph as a
4633880	4639880	useful tool in the search for oil, end quote. While not directly an employee of GSI, we have
4639880	4645400	already discussed Carl Highland and how he possibly leaked the Aztec story to his compatriot,
4645400	4653000	Leo Gebauer. Additionally, outside, but possibly tangential to GSI, we have two Mr. Gs of interest,
4653000	4658440	Otto German Arnold Schmidt and John Tarrant's Tate. Schmidt was an accomplished expert of
4658440	4664360	biophysics, bioengineering, electrical engineering, and magnetism. In 1937, Schmidt
4664360	4669560	even performed research at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, which I have previously
4669560	4675720	connected to undersea UFO crash retrievals. By March 1941, Schmidt was appointed by Dr.
4675720	4682200	Vannevar Bush as the official investigator for the National Defense Research Committee, or NDRC.
4682200	4688760	Shortly after, the NDRC evolved into Bush's famous OSRD, or the Office of Scientific Research
4688760	4695400	and Development. As we discussed with GSI, the role of OSRD in World War II was clearly defined,
4695400	4701800	a hard military focus helmed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. Schmidt would join John Tarrant's Tate
4701800	4708200	retrofitting PBY Catalina amphibious bombers with magnetic detecting equipment known as MAD,
4708200	4713720	Magnetic Anomaly Detector, later referred to as Magnetic Airborne Detector Device.
4713720	4719480	As we mentioned earlier, Gubauer's device could have possibly existed as early iterations of the
4719480	4725720	Magnetic Anomaly Detector. However, conclusions drawn by the fantastic research of the Ramses
4725720	4731320	point specifically to John Tarrant's Tate as a likely Mr. G, quote,
4731320	4736360	he had more degrees than a thermometer and had received them from such diverse institutions
4736360	4741800	as the Armour Institute, Creighton University, and the University of Berlin, he is the scientist
4741800	4749000	I have called Dr. G, end quote. Frank Scully when discussing one of the scientists known as Dr. G,
4749000	4754360	Tate earned his master's degree in physics and electrical engineering at the University of Omaha,
4754360	4761240	nestled in Nebraska alongside Creighton University, and earned his doctorate at the University of Berlin.
4761240	4767400	During World War I, quote, Tate and his colleagues verified the existence of discrete energy levels
4767400	4771800	and showed that there was a difference in the amount of energy required to spur radiation
4771800	4775880	and the amount of energy that is needed for ionization. This helped connect
4775880	4780600	Bohr's theory and those of Heisenberg and Schrödinger in quantum mechanics, end quote.
4781240	4786280	During the Second World War, Tate was recruited by Vannevar Bush to work for anti-summering
4786280	4791880	programs with the NDRC, which would later on become the OSRD. Tate would enjoy prestigious
4791880	4797480	positions during the war, including scientific advisor for the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet,
4797480	4803080	Assistant Chief of the Office of Field Services of OSRD, and the Director of Operations, Research,
4803080	4808040	and Chief Member of the Rocket Ordnance Division and National Defense Research Committee.
4808040	4814040	In July of 2011, Scott and Suzanne Ramsey traveled to the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis
4814040	4819160	to study archival material on Tate's life and work. Here they found evidence Tate had
4819160	4825080	actually traveled to the Southwest at the time of Aztec. Quote, in front of a large audience,
4825080	4830280	Tate stated that during a recent trip, he had experienced something that had changed his life.
4831400	4836120	According to him, what he had seen could change the way that energy is generated,
4836120	4841560	how food is produced, and overall how humanity could be served. This was a complete reversal
4841640	4847800	of his normal retiring attitude, end quote. From Highland to Tate and Dr. G's relation to Newton
4847800	4853640	and Gebauer, this chapter has served to attempt to unveil at least some of the nebulous Dr. G,
4853640	4860680	and also demonstrate Gebauer's doodle bug was not a fanciful object bought for $4.45 at a surplus
4860680	4866360	store, but instead based on real technology from real scientists, many of whom were connected with
4866360	4871400	geophysical services Inc. that would bridge the technology for submarine detection equipment
4871400	4875480	in World War II and foster close relationships with Vannevar Bush.
4881880	4886440	Thus far, we have discussed the Aztec crash, according to our primary sources,
4886440	4891000	outlined at the start of this project. I do want to spend a little bit of time
4891000	4897160	narrowing in on some of the work Steinman did in his 1986 epic UFO crash at Aztec,
4897160	4903240	a well kept secret. This enormous book only saw 1,000 copies printed, and as I stated at
4903240	4908760	the beginning of this project, I have purchased a copy for high quality scans for this video.
4908760	4915560	In his book, Steinman revolutionized the Aztec case by mentioning the IPU, MJ-12, and actually
4915560	4920520	identifying the team of scientists he claimed were present for the crash recovery, including
4920680	4927160	Vannevar Bush, Von Neumann, Highland, etc. Now, as much as I love this book and want to praise it,
4927160	4932680	Steinman remained throughout the book, somewhat cagey about his sources and origins of information.
4932680	4938040	Examples include definitive mention Leo Gebauer and Highland worked alongside one another without
4938040	4943640	evidence, an involvement of the IPU without firmly stating his sourcing or rationale.
4943640	4948840	So, as we have been doing, we must try and draw our own parallels and conclusions based upon the
4948840	4954360	research presented. Steinman became intrigued with behind the flying saucers after he once
4954360	4960040	read about the Aztec case in Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7.
4960040	4964840	The researcher wrote his epic based upon the foundation the Aztec crash was true,
4964840	4969160	but started back at square one to derive his own sources and methods.
4969160	4973960	Viewers of my channel know I reference often and hold a great deal of respect for Steinman,
4973960	4980280	a true researcher who admirably cold-contacted many figures associated with UFO legacy programs
4980280	4986200	and crash retrievals. The case portrayed by Steinman is remarkably similar to the case discussed by
4986200	4991400	Scully, Newton, and several Aztec witnesses completely disconnected from the original
4991400	4997480	Aztec reporting crew. So, no, Sean Kirkpatrick, there is no circular reporting here.
4997480	5003160	The major difference in Steinman's reporting is how access was gained to the craft. Thus far,
5003160	5008280	we have heard different testimony of oil field workers to the recovery team exploiting an existing
5008280	5013240	hole in one of the craft's portholes to open a doorway in the vehicle. Steinman's account
5013240	5018680	states one of the accredited scientists on site observed a knob-shaped protrusion with a button
5018680	5024440	in the middle through one of the craft portholes. The unnamed scientist thus ordered for the team
5024440	5029800	to pick up hammers and beat the porthole glass out. Then we return to what we have heard already,
5029800	5034360	where the team used a long pole to poke around in the craft and eventually open it.
5034360	5039240	Intriguing to me in this passage here is Steinman's reporting Bush's team attempted
5039240	5044280	myriad solutions to disassemble the enormous craft for removal, cutting torches,
5044280	5049160	diamond drills, diamond cutting saws, and more. But no device would face the metal,
5049160	5050920	let alone penetrate the material.
5051400	5057400	Quote, finally, one scientist after a very thorough examination found a place on the inside
5057400	5062680	where there was some sort of interlocking key device. When he pulled on the device,
5062680	5066840	a seam opened up on the ship at that particular location from top to bottom.
5067880	5072920	He continued around the ship and found several of these devices at equally spaced intervals.
5072920	5077000	Here was the key to disassembly problem that they had been looking for, end quote.
5077560	5082600	Again, I am strongly reminded of the words of director of naval intelligence and BDM
5082600	5088360	board member Sumner Shapiro. In his work, Steinman professed to contain knowledge of personnel,
5088360	5092920	brought in to study the craft over a year after its recovery. But unfortunately,
5092920	5097720	he did not detail where and how he obtained this data, but it is, nevertheless,
5097720	5103080	worth our time to study. Steinman stated, a little over a year and a half after the recovery,
5103080	5109160	November of 1949 to be exact, Dr. Eric Henry Wayne was called onto the project.
5109160	5111960	Now, does this name sound familiar to anyone?
5112680	5117000	Wayne worked as a consultant to the Wright Air Development Center on Aerodynamic
5117000	5121800	Metallurgical Design for the Structure Division and served on the staff for the University of
5121800	5127960	Cincinnati. Wayne was also one of the key scientific figures mentioned along the 1953
5127960	5133720	Kingman, Arizona crash retrieval. I previously made a video on Kingman, one of my all-time favorite
5133720	5139720	crash retrieval events, and of course, Wayne was mentioned. You know, David gave them first-hand
5139720	5146600	direct information from his sources of where to look, where to find the spacecraft, where to
5146600	5152520	literally go and open the door. Oh, by the way, there's a spacecraft recovered from Aztec. Open
5152520	5157640	this door, oh yeah, that's the one from Kingman. If Wayne really was involved with Aztec, perhaps
5157640	5162840	his efforts to understand the craft were indeed successful. Seen as during Kingman, while spearheading
5162840	5167800	the Office of Special Studies at Wright-Patterson Airfield, Wayne was suspected of leading the
5167800	5174040	reverse engineering team on the crashed non-human craft. As I said in my Kingman video, which still
5174040	5180440	holds true, Wayne has proved exceedingly difficult to track down, almost as if he was erased from
5180440	5186040	public record. All I can prove with Wayne is that he was indeed the head of the Office of Special
5186040	5191000	Studies at Wright-Patt and involved with Operation Upshot Knot-Hole. The nuclear test
5191000	5197480	thought to have been the impetus of the Kingman's craft's crash. All the way back in 1986, Steinman
5197480	5203000	understandably found difficulty digging up info on Wayne, thus believing the Majestic 12
5203000	5208600	wished to keep their prize scientist off public record. Steinman was able to wrangle up tiny
5208600	5214920	references to Wayne, his obituary for example, in the April 1961 edition of Mechanical Engineering
5214920	5220520	Magazine. The obituary shed more light on this enigmatic figure possibly connected to
5220520	5226040	Aztec and Kingman. Wayne hailed from Austria and after earning his degrees in teaching in Cincinnati,
5226040	5232120	Ohio, Wayne began work on secret government projects in 1949 at Wright Development Center.
5232120	5238280	In 1956, Wayne's department was moved to Sandia Laboratory Complex at Kirtland Air Force Base,
5238280	5243720	where he remained until his death. Remember, Sandia and Kirtland are two of the most critical
5243720	5249960	names in my research on UFO legacy program operation locations. Admirably, Steinman
5249960	5255480	contacted an individual in Albuquerque who knew Wayne very well. The individual was mentioned
5255480	5261880	only by the name MW. MW stated Wayne's personal papers were all confiscated by military
5261880	5266520	intelligence upon his death, placed behind lock and key of a highly secretive section
5266520	5271560	of the library at Kirtland Air Force Base. Wishing to discuss saucers off a line that
5271560	5277160	was likely being tampered with, Steinman and MW planned to exchange letters. Steinman never
5277160	5282360	heard back from MW, but did notice his mail being tampered with and a tracking device stuck to his
5282360	5288840	van. Unfortunately, the enigma that is Dr. Eric Wang persists today. Who was Wang? Was he called
5288840	5294040	in to assist with the Aztec crash in regards to study and duplication, and did he spearhead the
5294360	5296440	1953 Kingman crash recovery?
5301720	5307160	Historically, the Aztec case has rested solely on the credibility of Silas Newton. Since he
5307160	5311640	is a convicted conman, though the story is not that simple, the whole case has been labeled
5311640	5317480	by publications such as the ever-reliable Wikipedia as a hoax. But are there eyewitnesses
5317480	5323080	to the crash? Are there individuals who saw the disc, touched the disc, or perhaps participated
5323080	5328200	in the retrieval first hand? Well, thanks to the tireless work of Steinman and the Ramses,
5328200	5332600	yes indeed, we do. And let's briefly explore a few here.
5332600	5339000	Valentin Archuleta initially disclosed his testimony to William Steinman in 1982 under the pseudonym
5339000	5344520	VA. Archuleta served in World War II and was deployed to the harrowing eastern theater in the
5344520	5351320	Philippines. Archuleta was captured, but miraculously survived the horrific Japanese POW camps.
5351320	5355400	After the war, Archuleta served as a rancher in Aztec, New Mexico.
5355400	5362360	Valentin claimed early one morning between 1948 to 1950, he was outperforming his usual chores.
5362360	5366360	The rancher heard a large explosion. Looking in the direction of the sound,
5366360	5372040	Archuleta observed a huge disc-shaped craft, larger than his house, with a dome on top,
5372040	5377880	passed within 200 yards of him overhead. This disc appeared to be in trouble, skimming as low as
5377880	5382280	100 feet over the ground and wobbled as it careened overhead.
5382280	5387240	Valentin described the disc striking the corner of a 150-foot cliff face,
5387240	5391800	shooting sparks and rocks in every direction. The Ramses have sought and believed to have
5391800	5396200	found this location. Archuleta proceeded to call the military in Albuquerque,
5396200	5402040	aka Kirtland Air Force Base, a base I have on myriad occasions associated with UFO crash
5402040	5407480	retrieval operations. Valentin requested the Air Force call him back to explain what was happening,
5407480	5414760	but was never contacted again. Now, paramount to the whole Aztec story is, of course, oil. Recall,
5414760	5418360	all the way back to the beginning of this video when we described the event,
5418360	5425160	oil workers were some of the first civilians on scene. In 1948, 19-year-old Doug Nolan worked
5425160	5430680	for the El Paso Oil Company. Early one morning, Nolan was on his way to pick up his supervisor
5430680	5435880	Bill Ferguson to proceed to a grueling day of work in the oil field south of Aztec.
5435880	5439880	Bill and form Doug, a brush fire, had started on Hart Canyon Road,
5439880	5445480	12 miles northeast of Aztec. Since this fire was supposedly burning near some of the company's
5445480	5450920	oil drip tanks, the two dispatched towards the area. Arriving to the tanks, Bill and Doug were
5450920	5456440	greeted by several other oil workers already on scene to investigate. The two were told something
5456440	5463320	strange was sitting atop the hill. Quote, the craft was extremely large. We realized the craft
5463320	5469960	was smooth with no noticeable seams, rivets, bolts, or weld marks. It looked as if it was molded.
5469960	5475400	The craft was brushed aluminum, looking to be very smooth, but not highly polished aluminum,
5475400	5480360	like you would see on an airplane, end quote. Doug and the other men climbed atop the craft,
5480360	5485880	resting at an angle on the mesa, looking for some sort of entry point. The men found a small
5485880	5491880	porthole type feature atop the dome, quote, the windows or portholes looked like mirrors until
5491880	5497400	you would get closer, then you could see right through them, end quote. Just as the Aztec story
5497400	5503320	goes, Doug stated one porthole featured a hole no bigger than the size of a quarter. Inside the craft,
5503320	5508840	Doug would claim to see two bodies, quote, slumped over what appeared to be a control panel of sorts,
5508840	5514200	end quote. Quote, by the time the local law enforcement showed up, Bill, who was ignoring
5514200	5518920	the orders to stay away from the craft, was trying to poke around the craft with a firepull or
5518920	5525240	something he pulled off one of the trucks. Soon, he hit something, and a door or walkway appeared.
5525240	5530600	Some of us had to look inside and see what else was in there, and if anyone was in need of help,
5530600	5536520	end quote. The small bodies inside were charred a dark brown, likely burned to a crisp,
5536520	5542040	but the craft's interior was undamaged. Doug described the disc as 100 feet across,
5542040	5548200	describing the craft as having a very thin cross section, only 18 to 20 feet high and very thin
5548200	5553800	at the edges. Doug did describe some strange markings on the outer edge of the craft.
5553800	5559640	Gold color rings, three if I remember correctly, that ran around the entire outer edge of the disc,
5559640	5564600	end quote. Quite a number of locals began to arrive to the scene, according to Nolan,
5564600	5570840	including cattle ranchers Mr. and Mrs. Knight, who warned the oil workers to get away from the disc.
5570840	5575640	Doug's testimony recounts the circling of a helicopter overhead, which stood out to him
5575640	5582120	almost as bizarrely as the disc. A law enforcement officer, now identified as Manuel Sandoval from
5582120	5587480	the nearby Cuba, New Mexico, arrived on scene, claiming he had followed the low-flying disc
5587480	5593320	in a northerly direction. Similar to Archuleta, Sandoval described seeing the craft as wobbly
5593320	5599400	and fluttering like a leaf. The policeman quickly took initiative, ordering locals off the craft.
5599400	5604600	More men, including a local officer, pulled to the scene, who informed Sandoval the military
5604600	5609320	was well aware of the craft and that everybody should leave the area at once.
5609320	5615160	The military eventually showed up, in Doug's words, in a very big way. Doug was impressed with
5615160	5620600	how fast the uniformed men showed to scene. He was unaware if the men were USAF or ARMY,
5620600	5625560	as the two were recently separated, but their vehicles did, according to Doug, look ARMY.
5626120	5631640	Now, these men were not young guys, according to Doug's eyes. They appeared seasoned,
5631640	5636920	assertive, and well-trained, possibly IPU, if Steinman's theories are correct.
5636920	5641400	The military on scene quickly assembled everyone present and divided the people for
5641400	5646280	interview. The uniformed men told Doug and presumably others, quote,
5646280	5651720	This event was extremely important to the United States, that we were responsible for our national
5651720	5656360	security and that we will never talk to anyone about this event, end quote.
5656360	5661000	Other eyewitnesses described almost identical crash sites to Scott Ramsay.
5661080	5666680	These include Ken Farley, who while on his deathbed in 1999, disclosed to Ramsay,
5666680	5672360	Farley was visiting his aunt in Durango, Colorado, north of Aztec, and was on his way to Cedar Hill,
5672360	5678920	New Mexico, to see a friend the early morning of 25 March 1948. After his friend suggested they
5678920	5684600	check out a lot of activity on a nearby dirt road, the two drove to Hart Canyon Road.
5684600	5689640	Following the dust and dirt clouds from other cars, the two men got out and walked on top of the
5689640	5696040	mesa. The two men saw a huge object with people ranging from oil field workers to an older couple,
5696040	5702200	possibly the knights walking around the craft, quote. We saw a large disc shaped object,
5702200	5707800	aluminum in color, but not really very shiny, sort of dull aluminum. I could not see any
5707800	5713640	structures as far as doors or windows. The entire craft was very smooth. The craft did not appear
5713640	5719320	to have any damage, but lay on the mesa at a funny angle and sort of rested on its belly.
5719400	5723320	The disc had a bubble or protrusion on the bottom from what I can remember,
5723320	5729640	and also one on the top. It sort of reminded me of two pie pans with a bubble for a top and bottom.
5729640	5735640	The top bubble was larger than the bottom. The craft was lying at an angle, maybe 12 degrees or so,
5735640	5741880	end quote. Ken described the scene, two police officers on site, likely Sandoval and the local
5741880	5747480	officer, were asking folks to leave. Oil field workers were climbing all over the craft and
5747480	5753240	an old couple, again the knights, yelled at the men to get off. Shortly after, according to Ken,
5753240	5759560	disgruntled military personnel arrived whisking people off site. In a truly incredible turn of
5759560	5766280	events, the Ramses have located two Aztec witnesses on the side of the recovery efforts.
5766280	5771720	In 2001, Scott Ramsey interviewed a USAF veteran by the pseudonym George.
5771800	5775880	Ramsey states the identity of George was known by multiple researchers,
5775880	5780440	including the legendary Stanton Freedman. George claimed to be stationed as an airman
5780440	5787000	of the Walker Air Force Base in 1948. Formerly known as the infamous Roswell Army Airfield,
5787000	5791960	George claimed the Aztec retrieval was indeed coordinated out of Walker AFB.
5791960	5797880	Perfectly suited after Roswell Army Airfield had garnered experience retrieving non-human craft
5797880	5803400	solely eight months prior. George explained to Scott Ramsey the retrieval operation was
5803400	5808920	highly compartmentalized, with information restricted to a need-to-know basis concerning
5808920	5814200	the work to which each individual was assigned, similar to the Manhattan Project. George's
5814200	5818680	directive was to keep personnel records for everyone who was working the recovery.
5819640	5829720	Though he was not in the loop on everything, far from it in fact,
5829720	5835400	George claimed to see daily intelligence reports concerning progress made and people involved.
5835400	5839000	George stated the retrieval process took every part of two weeks.
5849000	5877560	Now, of course, if you've been paying attention, there is an issue here. If Dr.
5877560	5882920	Carl Highland was indeed present at Aztec, George failed his duties as the Ramses were able to
5882920	5888520	place Highland in the American Southwest at the time of Aztec. George recalled the Air Force based
5888520	5894200	out of Walker Air Force Base and Army Fifth Base out of Colorado as well as a few other select
5894200	5900200	basers or locations were involved in the crash. And recall how Steinman stated the U.S. Army
5900200	5905480	Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit arrived to the Aztec crash from Camp Hale, Colorado.
5905480	5911400	And while we're here, let's reference back to the U.S. Army CID slash FBI Sting Operation
5911400	5918360	conducted in 1950 to purchase Aztec crash photographs. Far removed from Newton, Scully,
5918360	5924360	or any of the main characters of the Aztec case, official memorandums discussing the Sting referenced
5924360	5929480	the Fifth Army Intelligence Division Regional Office being involved in receiving information
5929480	5934760	and interviewing witnesses surrounding the Sting. George claimed the personnel involved in the
5934760	5940280	recovery were highly trained and seasoned, similar to the IPU claims of Steinman and
5940280	5957480	eyewitness testimony of Doug Nolan. We can take this away from George's testimony.
5957480	5963160	The issues with the Roswell recovery led to Aztec featuring new people and new procedures,
5963160	5968040	and though George was not privy to policy, the Aztec proceedings were handled by highly
5968040	5973640	trained professionals. He had no direct knowledge, but George wagered the craft was taken to Los
5973640	5978680	Alamos. After the event, George noticed a tremendous amount of equipment at the then
5978680	5985240	Atomic Energy Commission lab, including flatbed and low-boy trucks. Interesting here, George also
5985240	5990680	claimed to see photos of the craft. As of course did Scully's wife, and as we know, elements of
5990680	5997640	the U.S. DOD and IC were interested in intercepting such images. Possibly paramount to our entire
5997640	6002840	investigation, Ramsay asked George if the Air Force was upset with Scully, who wrote the
6002840	6015480	first book on Aztec, and a bestseller at that. If George's account is true, this tremendously
6015480	6020520	strengthens the argument Newton and Gabbower were put through grueling trial as punishment for
6020520	6031560	leaking the story. Tangential to our story today, but just as Aztec was born from Scully's behind
6031560	6037560	the flying saucers, so too did the book give rise to the testimony of one of the most critically
6037560	6045240	overlooked characters in all of UFO lore, Dr. Robert Sarbacher. In 1950, Canadian government
6045240	6050200	senior radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith wrote to the Controller of Telecommunications
6050200	6055640	in the Department of Transport requesting for Canada to begin its first official investigation
6055640	6063320	into UFOs, specifically studying complex magnetism as a form of propulsion. This document was never
6063320	6068920	supposed to be public. The classification of this document was likely accidentally downgraded.
6068920	6076120	The document was classified top secret until 15 September 1969 and remained largely hidden until
6076120	6083080	UFO researchers Arthur Bray and Stanton Friedman obtained a copy in 1978. In this letter, Smith
6083080	6089800	made three astounding claims told to him by a source within Washington regarding UFOs.
6089800	6095480	1. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States government,
6095480	6104040	higher even than the H-bomb. 2. Flying saucers exist. 3. Their modus operandi is unknown,
6104040	6109080	but concentrated efforts are being made by a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush.
6110360	6116840	4. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance.
6117480	6122760	Wilbert Smith, a man whom Silas Newton shared a tremendous amount of respect for, would go
6122760	6128360	on to spearhead Canada's first two UFO programs, Projects Magnet and Second Story.
6128360	6135240	3. Smith was possibly even exposed to technologies of unknown origin by U.S. government officials,
6135240	6141240	but of course, that is not our story today. The source of Wilbert B. Smith for this profound
6141240	6148200	memo, 1. Dr. Robert Sarbacher. Sarbacher served as a respected physicist and consultant to
6148200	6153720	Vannevar Bush's and the DoD's Research and Development Board in the 1950s under the Truman
6153720	6159560	administration. The esteemed Harvard graduate and student of Einstein served as the founder and
6159560	6165480	dean of Georgia Institute of Technology, director of research at WED Labs, scientific consultant
6165480	6170440	to the U.S. Marines and as mentioned earlier, involved in the Joint Research and Development
6170440	6176600	Board. Sarbacher's research specialized in remote-controlled rockets, though curiously,
6176600	6182440	Sarbacher has largely been wiped from the annals of history similar to Dr. Eric Henry Wang.
6183000	6189320	On 15 September 1950, Wilbert Smith interviewed Robert Sarbacher. Smith stated he had read
6189320	6193960	Scullies behind the flying saucers and wished to know how much of the book was fact,
6193960	6199960	to which Sarbacher replied, quote, the facts reported in the book are substantially correct,
6199960	6205640	end quote. The two would discuss magnetic propulsion systems behind UFOs before Smith's
6205640	6212040	source would inform Smith of the shocking points made in the 1950 memo. Beginning his research on
6212040	6217400	Aztec after being struck by behind-the-flying saucers, William Steinman quickly attempted to
6217400	6223880	track down Robert Sarbacher. The accomplished physicist stated he himself had no association
6223880	6229560	with any of the people involved with UFO crash recoveries and had no specifics on dates of
6229560	6235640	successful recoveries. However, Sarbacher had been invited to participate in several discussions
6235640	6241320	regarding recoveries whilst consulting with the R&D board but was never given access to personally
6241320	6247320	attend. Sarbacher still did attest meetings regarding UFO crash retrievals were held by
6247320	6252440	the Military Research and Development Board at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and involved
6252440	6258200	figures such as John von Neumann, Vannevar Bush, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, three key
6258200	6264200	U.S. scientists and three figures linked to the Aztec crash. Though he did not receive
6264200	6270280	materials or photographs, Sarbacher had been privy to UFO crash reports during his official
6270280	6274520	Pentagon duties. In the direct words of Sarbacher, quote,
6274520	6279240	About the only thing I remember at this time is that certain materials reported to have come
6279240	6284680	from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories
6284680	6290920	analyzed them very carefully. There were reports that instruments or people operating these machines
6290920	6296920	were also very lightweight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and acceleration
6296920	6301800	associated with their machinery. I remember in talking with some of the people at the office
6301800	6307160	that I got the impression these quote unquote aliens were constructed like certain insects we've
6307160	6312440	observed on earth, wherein because of the low mass the inertial forces involved in operation of
6312440	6318520	these instruments would be quite low. I still do not know why the higher order of classification
6318520	6323080	has been given and why the denial of the existence of these devices, end quote.
6323640	6329160	Obviously, Sarbacher's described lightweight materials closely resemble the metals described
6329160	6334920	from the Roswell and Aztec wreckage. And we do, of course, have a possible paper trail of custody
6334920	6340600	here. As in my video on Battelle Memorial Institute, I discussed the contractor receiving pieces of the
6340600	6346840	Roswell wreckage to test on the now coveted material used in many industries such as aerospace and
6346840	6353080	medical, night and all. However, Sarbacher's description of biologics do somewhat differ here.
6353080	6358840	Certainly, the biologics described in Aztec and Roswell sound far more humanoid than insect,
6358840	6364120	but this could attest to the likelihood multiple non-human species have visited and crashed on
6364120	6369480	the planet. As we continue, I would strongly suggest reading the book by Grant Cameron,
6370040	6376760	UFOs Area 51 and Government Informants. On a future unknown date, Steinman would write to UFO
6376760	6380840	researcher Grant Cameron. The letter would discuss friend of Cameron and Steinman,
6380840	6387320	the legendary Stanton Freedman, had also tracked down Sarbacher in 1983. According to Sarbacher,
6387320	6392120	quote, I did not attend the meetings at right field concerning the recovered saucers,
6392120	6397160	but there was one person who attended all of the meetings. I can't remember his name.
6397160	6402680	He wrote a book on electrical engineering, was a member of the RDB, and was the head of the
6402680	6408600	electrical engineering department at a university in Pennsylvania, end quote. Based on this statement,
6408600	6413960	Steinman did some digging on his own volition and derived a name. Steinman received direct
6413960	6420360	confirmation of this name, another one of the most under discussed names in all of UFO lore
6420360	6428280	and usual of this channel, one Dr. Eric A. Walker. I'm sure he needs no introduction here,
6428280	6434760	but let's alongside Sarbacher discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker. The genius that was Dr. Walker was born
6434760	6442600	in 1910. He received his BS in engineering in 1932, MBA in 1933, and his DSC in 35,
6442600	6447720	all from Harvard University. In his early professional years, Walker would teach mathematics
6447800	6452680	and electrical engineering at Tufts College. Walker would then join the University of Connecticut,
6452680	6457160	where he taught electrical engineering and initiated courses for a special war training
6457160	6463400	program. It is widely thought that here is where Walker met Dr. Vannevar Bush and likely became
6463400	6469560	initiated into UFO programs. During the Second World War, the doctor would join the Underwater
6469560	6473720	Sound Laboratory at Harvard University, where he would quickly find himself in charge of
6473720	6479400	ordinance, specifically weapons. The accomplished scientist studies in Underwater Sound Lab led
6479400	6484120	to the creation of the homing torpedo, which shall Walker be awarded with the Naval Ordinance
6484120	6490520	Development Award and a Presidential Certificate of Merit. By 1944, Walker would join Vannevar
6490520	6495560	Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development, and by 45, Walker would join Penn
6495560	6501160	State University, which he would later become president of. It was at Penn State, at the behest
6501160	6507720	of the Navy, Walker would create the Applied Research Laboratory, now a DOD-designated U.S. Navy
6507720	6514920	UARC, or University-affiliated Research Center. Now, I talk in extreme detail in most of my projects
6514920	6520680	about UARCs and their semi-private corporate counterparts, FFRDCs, Federally Funded Research
6520680	6526600	and Development Centers. Involvement in UFO legacy program operations, so, reference any of these
6526600	6532360	projects for more on that topic. Recall how Sarbacher set in 1950, as consultant to the
6532360	6538440	Defense Research Board, UFO crash retrieval meetings were held at Wright Patterson by the R&D Board
6538440	6545480	spearheaded by Vannevar Bush. While in that same year of 1950, Walker sat on the R&D Board and would
6545480	6552520	later go on to serve as its executive secretary from 1950 to 1952. Indeed, Stanton Friedman's
6552520	6557720	Sharp Eye uncovered an early 1950s document from the Department of the Army to chairman
6557720	6563960	of the U.S. Communications Intelligence Board, USCIB. The subject of this document is, quote,
6563960	6569480	indoctrination for special intelligence for Mr. Eric Arthur Walker, end quote.
6569480	6576200	Walker would go on to assist in many DOD and IC projects, including Project Azorian in 1972,
6576200	6582440	to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K-129 at the behest of the National Underwater Reconnaissance
6583240	6587080	Office. Now this is interesting, as I have directly connected the vessel used,
6587080	6593160	the Glomar Explorer, and the highly secretive Nuro to undersea UFO crash retrieval operations,
6593160	6599400	and I highly recommend viewing that project. Throughout the 1980s, the name Dr. Eric A.
6599400	6605720	Walker was kept secret by select UFO investigators, such as Stanton Friedman and William Steinman,
6605720	6611480	in hopes the doctor could be convinced to publicly disclose his involvement in UFO crash retrievals
6611480	6617640	and material exploitation programs. William Steinman first reached out to Dr. Walker on 19
6617640	6625000	March 1948. Walker's response was bizarre, to say the least. Dr. Walker typed on the lower portion
6625000	6629800	of Steinman's sent letter, and the doctor even cut off Steinman's return address and stamped it
6629800	6636200	on the front of his envelope, the correspondence read in all caps, quote, Stop. Don't try and
6636200	6643160	find me. I came on that machine, I will leave May 15, ergo, quiet, quiet, quiet, end quote.
6643720	6650680	Steinman would attempt to contact Walker again on 31 May 1984, with no response. But on 30 August
6650680	6656920	1987, the ever-persistent Steinman would call Walker, and to his surprise, Walker answered.
6657480	6662360	Straight to the punch, Steinman told Walker he wished to speak on meetings at Wright Patterson
6662360	6668120	in 49-50, concerning military recoveries of flying saucers and their occupants.
6668120	6672680	Just as shocking as Walker even answering the call, he would state, quote,
6672680	6676120	Yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter.
6676120	6679080	Why do you want to know about that? End quote.
6679080	6684840	In this 1987 conversation, Walker would reveal he knew of the Majestic 12, in fact,
6684840	6691560	he had for 40 years, so all the way back to 1947. Then gave Steinman a bizarre reference to Don
6691560	6697000	Quixote, quote, I believe that you're chasing after windmills and fighting with windmills.
6697960	6703000	Walker told Steinman the researchers' efforts were futile, but still the doctor would see
6703000	6708760	if he could wrangle up any of the 1950 Wright Patterson notes. But to this day, I have heard
6708760	6713480	nothing of these notes making their way to the public. Now, I know I'm spending a significant
6713480	6718360	amount of time on Walker and Sarbacher, but the fact behind the flying saucers containing the
6718360	6723880	Aztec story led to the discovery of two of the most critical and understudied individuals in the
6723880	6729480	subject is paramount to our investigation. Several UFO researchers would approach Walker
6729480	6733560	in the late 1980s, but few were able to speak with him.
6733560	6739640	In conversations with Henry Azad de Hel, aka Armin Victorian, Walker would reveal he was present
6739640	6746040	for the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash retrieval, an all-time favorite case of mine.
6746040	6751240	Walker would tell Victorian, quote, Only a couple people are capable of handling this issue.
6751240	6756120	Unless your mind ability is like Einstein's or likewise, I do not think you can achieve
6756120	6762520	anything, end quote. Walker would even bring up ESP, extra sensory perception, stating, quote,
6762520	6766360	How good is your sixth sense? How much do you know about ESP,
6766360	6772600	unless you know about it and how to use it? You would not be taken in. Only a few know about it,
6772600	6777720	end quote. Believe it or not, we could spend another two hours here on Walker and cover
6777720	6784280	perplexing coded letters returned to Steinman, 1988 conversations with T. Scott Crane stating
6784280	6790360	Walker would no longer speak on UFOs and much more. What secrets could Walker have possibly
6790360	6798600	held onto regarding Aztec? My wager many as Walker joined the DRB one year following the incident, 1949.
6803560	6809320	Integral to Steinman's 1986 reconstruction of the Aztec retrieval is the interplanetary
6809320	6815880	phenomenon unit, or IPU, as we will call it from here on out. I have discussed the IPU many times
6815880	6821400	before, including speaking on the documents with Ryan Wood, who has served alongside his late father,
6821400	6826520	Dr. Robert Wood, as the premier researchers attempting to authenticate or disprove the
6826520	6832120	majestic 12 documents. Since the IPU is so integral to piecing together the retrieval,
6832120	6837000	let's spend some time reviewing the infamous interplanetary phenomenon unit.
6837000	6843480	Now frustratingly, Steinman never presented strong evidence for why IPU, stationed out of Camp Hale,
6843480	6850200	Colorado, was the on-site military team securing the craft and crash LZ, only reporting the word
6850200	6857240	from sources. Steinman was, however, one of the trailblazing researchers to prove the IPU's existence.
6857240	6864360	Like just about everything related to Majestic 12, or UFO crash retrievals, IPU is not without
6864360	6869720	controversy. Researchers such as Brad Sparks and Kevin Randall have professed quote-unquote
6869720	6875960	truth about the IPU, claiming this unit was no more than the input-processing unit of Army
6875960	6882920	Intelligence's later Army AFSTC, Foreign Science and Technology Center. Basically, IPU was the
6882920	6889080	incoming document's mailroom for Army S&T post-Sputnik in the 1968 Space Era.
6889080	6895720	Sparks claims the IP moniker has been misrepresented as interplanetary phenomenon because the real
6895720	6902440	unit to him did handle the receipt and forwarding of UFO reports. FOIA documents we will discuss
6902440	6908120	have labeled the IPU as existing through quote-unquote institutional memory. Sparks believe this is
6908120	6915240	because Army FOIA officers have simply misremembered around the IPU. Now, I find great fault in this
6915240	6921240	reporting and very little research of substance, but now that we have addressed the IPU counterpoints,
6921240	6926360	let's begin to dive in. We will primarily address the work of Robert and Ryan Wood,
6926360	6931800	as well as UFO researcher Anthony Bergalea here. Please check out their respective sites,
6932520	6939320	MajesticDocuments.com and UFOExplorations.com. In 1980, the late Richard Hall, Associate of
6939320	6944600	Mufon and NiCAP, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the U.S. Army, requesting
6944600	6951000	information concerning Army Intelligence records relating to UFOs. It is unknown and debated if
6951000	6956760	Hall actually said the words interplanetary phenomenon unit in his FOIA letter. Hall was
6956760	6961560	advised by Colonel William Guild, Director of Army Counterintelligence, that quote,
6961560	6966360	please be advised that the interplanetary phenomenon unit of the Scientific and Technical
6966360	6971480	Branch Counterintelligence Directorate was disestablished in the late 1950s and never
6971480	6976840	reactivated. All records pertaining to this unit were surrendered to the U.S. Air Force Office of
6976840	6983400	Special Investigations with Operation Blue Book, end quote. Fast forwarding to 1984, we find Steinman
6983480	6989560	conducting similar FOIAs for IPU. Steinman was additionally told the IPU was disestablished
6989560	6994360	and all records were transferred to USAF in the late 1950s. According to Lieutenant Colonel
6994360	7000040	Lance Cornyn, the IPU was formed as an in-house project as an interest item for an Assistant
7000040	7005960	Chief of Staff for Intelligence. The IPU was never a unit or formally recognized mission
7005960	7012920	or authority, only through institutional memory did the Army CIC have any recollection of the IPU.
7012920	7019880	Let's fast forward again to 1987 to above top secret author Timothy Good, who filed similar FOIAs.
7019880	7026440	Good was given the exact same spiel as Steinman and Hall. Good was given the same spiel as Steinman
7026440	7032120	and Hall. So, what can we learn from these FOIAs? A. The Army confirmed with the Army
7032120	7038120	Department of Counterintelligence there was in fact an interplanetary phenomenon unit or IPU.
7038120	7045400	B. The IPU was disestablished in the late 1950s. C. The IPU records were quote-unquote
7045400	7051400	surrender to the Air Force in conjunction with Project Blue Book. D. The unit was a quote-unquote
7051400	7056440	in-house project as an interest item for an unnamed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence.
7057000	7063320	E. The unit lacked formal function, mission, or authority. F. It is only through quote-unquote
7063320	7067000	institutional memory that the Army knows of the IPU's existence.
7067560	7072680	If IPU records were given over to Project Blue Book, why are there no records of IPU
7072680	7078040	in Blue Book's many reports? With the Army's response, it is clear there is recollection of
7078040	7084920	IPU, but the Army CIC is not forthcoming about information or records. Years later, Kufon,
7084920	7091800	or the computer UFO network, received a reply from AFOSI that IPU material had been destroyed,
7091800	7098600	but offered no further information. This contradicts Army reports the IPU maintained no
7098600	7103480	records. Some further intriguing breadcrumbs have been reported by Anthony Burgalia.
7103480	7110360	The Defense Central Index of Investigations, DCII, is a DOD Automated Control Index that
7110360	7116200	identifies and reports on investigations conducted by all DOD investigative agencies.
7116200	7121320	Essentially, this served as the most complex and comprehensive acknowledged military
7121320	7127080	and intelligence data center in existence. In the early 1980s, researcher John Frick
7127080	7132840	became aware of DCII computer printouts made under the command of the legendary general
7132840	7138920	Douglas MacArthur that related to UFO sightings and investigations. The first line of the short
7139880	7149560	quote, I have not seen this printout reproduced, but if real, fully destroys the IPU counterargument
7150120	7156520	proposed by Brad Sparks. Frick even stated some of his sources, such as the former AFOSI agent
7156520	7164360	Rudolph M. Schelmar, revealed that MacArthur's IPU files were indeed transferred in 1962 to AFOSI.
7164360	7169720	Perhaps IPU really did operate under MacArthur. After all, the general would discuss quote
7169720	7177240	unquote interplanetary war in 1955 and 1962 addresses. Remember here, Army FOIA stated
7177240	7184280	IPU was an interest item for a joint chief of staff for intelligence, aka a G2. MacArthur's G2
7184280	7189400	was Colonel Charles A. Willoughby, who later became chief of MacArthur's intelligence staff.
7189400	7194840	Willoughby also retired as a major general. Brigalia reported Willoughby was even equated
7194840	7200680	with the legendary Philip J. Corso. However, researchers such as Timothy Good suggest the
7200680	7206600	IPU did not operate directly under MacArthur, but by someone from even higher rank, MacArthur's
7206600	7213160	immediate superior, General George C. Marshall, Army chief of staff and later US Secretary of
7214120	7219320	Defense. George C. Marshall is additionally considered by the woods as the origin for the IPU
7219320	7225800	and remember William Steinman reported Marshall himself mobilized the IPU for the Aztec retrieval.
7225800	7230680	Now let's move into discussing the IPU as it appears throughout the majestic documents.
7230680	7235960	I'm going to skip over Thomas Cantwell, the enigmatic self-proclaimed IPU member who gave
7235960	7240760	several majestic document drops to Timothy Cooper. So if you want to learn more about him,
7240760	7244440	go watch my Majestic Documents investigation with Ryan Wood.
7244440	7248040	If you are wondering why I am mentioning majestic documents at all,
7248040	7253480	I additionally recommend watching that same piece. Within the majestic documents are two files
7253480	7259240	alleged to be records from the IPU themselves. The interplanetary phenomenon unit field order
7259240	7267240	dated July 1947, given to Tim Cooper by Cantwell via UPS between 1993 and 1996,
7267240	7275560	as well as the IPU report dated July 1947, given to Cooper from Cantwell personally in July of 1995.
7275560	7280840	Now the quote-unquote leak dates of these IPU documents should put to bed any theory
7280840	7286920	Steinman took the IPU reports at face value and constructed his Aztec case around the two documents.
7286920	7291400	Outside of the two alleged internal IPU documents, there are several majestic
7291400	7297480	documents that mention the IPU. These include a 5 March 1942 memo from George Marshall to
7297480	7302360	President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussing the recovery of an unidentified airplane following
7302360	7308280	the infamous 1942 Battle of Los Angeles. Marshall says in this disputed document,
7308280	7313960	the craft was likely of interplanetary origin and suggested a special intelligence unit be
7313960	7319000	created for further investigation of the phenomenon. But let's start here with the short
7319000	7326360	IPU field order dated July 4, 1947 and marked top secret. The one page memo directs a commanding
7326360	7331800	officer to take a counterintelligence team to a UFO crash site and report to the G2 at
7331800	7337240	Conrant Field, New Mexico, which is of course Roswell. The commanding officer was to take a
7337240	7343160	non-commission OIC, an aeronautical engineer, a scientist, a security officer, and a medical
7343160	7350520	doctor and to provide a report by the 28th of July. The IPU report, dated July 22, 1947,
7350520	7355320	gives us far more to work with and let's break this down a little bit as I have connected this
7355320	7360360	document to various crash retrievals in the past. The intelligence assessment references
7360360	7367480	recovery of multiple fallen objects from 4 to 6 July 1947. This possibly lends credence to Roswell
7367480	7373960	featuring multiple UFO crash retrievals. Now the document was prepared by the Army IPU, Scientific
7373960	7379800	and Technical Branch, Counterintelligence Directorate at the behest of G2, the exact same descriptors of
7379800	7386040	IPU given to 1980s researchers from FOIA. But to play devil's advocate, this document released
7386040	7392760	in 1995. So if it is a hoax, the authors of the hoax could have easily copied known IPU details
7392760	7397880	from researchers such as Steinman and Hall. What interests me here though is mention of
7397880	7403720	a special radiobiological team accompanied by an SED and security detail from Sandian
7403720	7409400	National Labs under orders from Colonel Hasbrook. Armed forces special weapons project being
7409400	7415000	ordered to secure the immediate area surrounding the Roswell crash site. Select scientists from
7415000	7420120	the Atomic Energy Commission were amongst this team, including Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer,
7420120	7425320	father of the atomic bomb, an accused member of the Aztec crash by Steinman a little less than
7425320	7431640	one decade earlier. But that's not all. The IPU also stated Dr. Detlev Bronk was in charge of
7431640	7437800	biologic autopsies just as in the Aztec case. The document states President Truman would be given
7437800	7442520	a limited briefing on the incident by General Hoyt Vandenberg, but that General Eisenhower,
7442520	7447480	later president, would actually be shown the recovery of the wreckage. According to majestic
7447480	7454120	documents lore, the 1952 Eisenhower briefing document disclosed details of Roswell to Eisenhower.
7454120	7459560	If he had already been briefed by the IPU, why the double briefing? Well, this could be explained
7459560	7465000	as the illustrious MJ-12 was established according to the Eisenhower briefing document later in
7465000	7471080	September 1947, so the double briefing makes sense. The ties between Aztec, Roswell,
7471720	7478200	and Maj. 12 are indeed intriguing as the IPU report states George Marshall was the only cabinet member
7478200	7483880	to date to know about crashed UFOs, but that Secretary of Defense James Forstall would be
7483880	7490440	briefed on certain aspects. In Maj. 12 lore, Truman and Forstall engaged in September 1947
7490440	7496200	meetings to establish the Majestic-12. To learn more about Forstall and his untimely demise,
7496200	7501880	I also again recommend watching my Maj. 12 video. Just as in the Aztec case,
7501880	7507400	recovered craft were stored at Los Alamos and access was gate kept by one Lieutenant General
7507400	7514200	Collins. Now addressing point nine in the document here, I have connected this to the 1974 Koyama
7514200	7520520	Mexico UFO crash retrieval, a fascinating and scintillating case. According to the document,
7520520	7526440	Sandia Personnel suffered some sort of form of non-human containment breach, possibly hazardous
7526440	7532280	liquids or gas, and three technicians were killed. Ultimately here, the study of the IPU
7532280	7537720	does not lead us to any hard conclusions. The illustrious unit exists, but its memories and
7537720	7543480	records have been destroyed. I do find it utterly fascinating the sources of Steinman informed him,
7543480	7549080	Marshall, and the IPU helmed the Aztec recovery many years before the quote unquote leaks of
7549080	7554920	these documents. And although these Maj. 12 IPU documents released years after Steinman's research
7554920	7559400	are rightly disputed and we cannot lean on them for any definitive statements,
7559400	7565160	they paint striking parallels between the Roswell crash and Aztec crash just eight months later.
7570280	7575080	Like any good crash retrieval case before his passing, the legendary Leonard Stringfield wrote
7575080	7580840	about, connected with sources, and reported on Aztec. Viewers of my channel will absolutely
7580840	7586680	recognize I often celebrate Stringfield and his UFO crash retrieval status reports one through seven
7586680	7592440	as the best work on UFO crash retrieval operations period. Stringfield was approached by Steinman
7592440	7599320	in 1985 to write the foreword for the 1986 epic that is the ultra rare UFO crash at Aztec a well
7599320	7604520	kept secret. In his foreword, Stringfield wrote he was incredibly hesitant to re-engage with the
7604520	7609400	case. Stringfield admitted he too had been conditioned that the case was nothing more than
7609400	7616360	a hoax, schemed by Silas Newton and his dubious partner in crime, Leo Gabauer. Stringfield stated
7616360	7622120	he was equally initially swindled by debunks presented by William or Bill Moore at a Mouffon
7622120	7629240	symposium in 1985. Moore would around 1989 admit he was working with the US intelligence community
7629240	7632200	to sow disinformation into the subject of UFOs.
7659240	7672680	Steinman's convictions and thoroughness led to Stringfield re-engaging with the case,
7672680	7679560	but what history did he have with Aztec? Let's travel back to 1974 when Aztec had long been
7679560	7685960	labeled a hoax due to the sketchy reporting of JP Kahn. One John Spencer Carr, a retired South
7685960	7690360	Florida professor of mass communications at the University of South Florida Tampa,
7690360	7695400	went public with what he professed to be new information regarding the Aztec incident in
7695400	7701560	October of 1974. Fortunately, Steinman obtained clippings of Carr's testimony in an October
7701560	7708200	1974 Clearwater Sun issue. Carr stated he had in his possession what he deemed to be credible
7708200	7714280	information regarding Aztec, disclosed to him by five sources including a senior USAF official
7714280	7719560	involved in the retrieval. Carr claimed the craft and bodies of Aztec were flown to Edwards
7719560	7725480	Air Force Base and ultimately taken to Wright Patterson. Two locations I do strongly suspect
7725480	7731160	are engaged in UFO legacy program operations, but almost as soon as it was resurrected,
7731160	7737480	Aztec was once again demolished shortly after in 1975 in an article in official UFO by Mike
7737480	7745000	McKellen titled the UFO crash of 1948 is a hoax. Admittedly, Carr did seemingly report many of
7745000	7751000	the Aztec details incorrectly or was confusing Aztec with another case, claiming a crash date
7751000	7757400	of 12 February 48, claiming military men approached a 30 foot saucer with guns drawn and the presence
7757400	7763400	of 12 non-human bodies dead from decompression. In the interest of time, we will not cover Carr's
7763400	7769000	claims in McKellen's debunk as we did Newton and Kahn, but where does Stringfield fit in here?
7769000	7773800	Carr and Stringfield would speak extensively after Carr went public in 1974, but Carr would
7773800	7781000	never reveal his sources. On 6 February 1982, Carr, fearing his own mortality, would disclose
7781000	7786520	the name of his Air Force source to Stringfield in Leonard's own words, quote. When Professor
7786520	7792360	Carr named his source, I sat back dumbfounded. I knew his name well in research and recalled some of
7792360	7798120	the source's comments on UFOs while he served as an Air Force officer. But Carr was quick to tie
7798120	7803640	a string to his disclosure, stating please Len, keep the name to yourself, please spare me any
7803640	7810040	trouble as long as I live, end quote. Carr and ultimately Steinman would reignite Stringfield's
7810040	7817400	waning interest in Aztec and by 1989 in UFO crash retrieval status report five, Stringfield was writing
7817400	7822600	again about Aztec and mentioning the case in the same sentences as Roswell and Kingman,
7822600	7829480	two crashes I and many others place extreme confidence in. In 1991 status report six,
7829480	7834200	Stringfield would discuss and reproduce a fascinating new witness to the Aztec case.
7834840	7839400	Stringfield was given permission to reproduce the report on the crash at Farmington,
7839400	7846440	written in 1991 by Chuck Oldham. Oldham had in 1990 come in contact with an Aztec informant,
7846440	7851080	a former alleged military officer with high security clearances. And together,
7851080	7856280	the two published the witness's disclosures, as well as diagrams and images of the craft and
7856280	7862520	biologics. The witness described accessing classified files, discussing crashed alien craft
7862520	7867880	in their occupants. Within the files, the witness stumbled upon what was an image of a perfectly
7867880	7874200	intact circular shaped craft, lying tilted five to 10 degrees on one side on the ground in the
7874200	7879880	desert. The craft was metallic, appearing similar to brushed aluminum. There did not appear to be a
7879880	7885320	crater or ground surface disturbance caused by the impact. The report referenced to the image
7885320	7890040	and craft in great detail. The witness claimed the report listed the craft was retrieved near the
7890040	7896440	town of Farmington, New Mexico, just south of Aztec prior to 1950. The report stated, but the
7896440	7901720	witness was unable to confirm in the photographs that the dome part of the saucer featured porthole
7901720	7906840	type features, though they were not made of any glass. Just like the Aztec story goes,
7906840	7913000	one porthole had a puncture, the diameter of a pencil. The report listed the retrieval team tried
7913000	7918280	diamond drills, acetylene torches, and more on the porthole, but nothing was able to damage the
7918280	7924760	craft and porthole. This reminds me closely of the 1963 RB case I covered in UFO whistleblowers
7924760	7930840	volume two. And just like the rest of our Aztec testimonies, an accidental fiddling of the damaged
7930840	7935640	porthole led to the craft opening. One point here, though, is at odds with the rest of our
7935640	7940680	Aztec discussion. The witness claimed the craft was 30-something feet in diameter.
7940680	7944840	The beams inside, according to Oldham Source, were four foot tall humanoids,
7944840	7950920	badly charred, wearing a strong woven fabric flight suit. The report author concludes the craft
7950920	7956920	likely operated on magnetic or gravitational fields to travel great distances in a minuscule
7956920	7957720	amount of time.
7986920	7993480	Not so sure about the Aztec case. Since that time, there have been multiple individuals that I respect
7993480	7997240	quite a bit who have talked about this case and said there's a little more than meets the eye than
7997240	8003880	the JP Kahn debunk. Of course, with Ross Goldhardt on Jesse Michael saying, Nat Kobitz
8003880	8008920	directly or strongly inferred or directly told him that the Aztec case was real,
8009640	8014920	I thought, well, now might be the time to dive in and give this case a fair shake as possible.
8015720	8020760	If you're like me and arrive at similar conclusions, I do wager that this case likely
8020760	8026920	happened and I do wager it's a very complicated case. Similar to Roswell, we might be confusing
8026920	8032280	details of multiple cases. With the UFO report, the crash at Farmington and some other witness
8032280	8038840	testimony, specifically Professor Carr, multiple individuals talk about a 30-plus foot saucer
8038840	8044360	crashing and not a 99.9 diameter disc. Maybe there's some details getting confused here,
8044360	8050760	but believe it or not, and I know I say this in every video, I think this project really
8050760	8055080	only scratches the surface of Aztec. Remember how much time we devoted to
8055080	8062840	IPU? Well, as it turns out, there's even more majestic documents. I don't know if you can see
8062840	8068120	it on the camera right here that involve Aztec. Now, why did I not include this right here?
8068120	8075800	This 45-page, I think it's a DIA majestic document that Ryan and Robert Wood have not even discussed
8076600	8082280	very long. Well, this is because this document drop came out in 2017 through a radio show host
8082280	8087080	from a trusted source. I can't remember the woman's name right now. I believe it's her first name,
8087080	8091720	Heather. But I would like to get in contact with her to find out who this trusted source is. Of
8091720	8098440	course, a majestic documents drop in 2017 is decades beyond when the majority of documents drop
8098440	8104600	between 1984 and 1996, let's say. So I'm quite intrigued why this specific set of documents
8105240	8111800	was leaked in 2017, a very critical date in UFO lore. But the reason I didn't speak about this is
8111800	8117240	because this document says some pretty bizarre things, pretty outlandish things specifically
8117240	8125080	about Nikola Tesla. It reads almost like a novel. It's a really good read, which is
8125800	8130120	kind of why I take apprehension here. But also because this majestic document, again,
8130120	8132760	I'll put it right up here and I'll put the link in the video description,
8133400	8139800	pretty much tells the Aztec case verbatim in the same style of story as Steinman.
8140360	8144360	So it talks about IPU. It talks about all the recovery methods Steinman talks about. So
8145000	8150440	one of my preliminary theories here is that this document drop, of course, as soon as a ton of
8150440	8155960	interest starts back up in UFOs around 2017, quite possibly this document drop was meant to muddy
8155960	8163240	the water surrounding the Aztec case. And maybe by recovering Steinman's account of the case that
8163240	8167800	it just means, hey, Steinman could have ripped this off a random majestic document that existed
8167800	8171880	way back in the day. So that's why I didn't include this. And speaking of Steinman and
8171880	8178440	majestic documents, you know, the IPU report and field order dropped in 1995 in 1996, I believe
8178440	8183480	are the dates off the top of my head. Now, one of the things I grappled with back and forth is,
8183480	8189880	did Steinman have a previous experience with these documents? And he constructed his Aztec case
8189880	8195800	based upon the IPU report specifically, because as we know, General George Marshall, others,
8196520	8203240	the IPU, the Sandia, Los Alamos are mentioned within that document. But I, and perhaps there
8203240	8208280	could be creams here, because the same thing with Dr. Eric Walker, Steinman did keep his name secret
8208280	8212360	for quite a few years and hope that, you know, Walker would speak out, perhaps there's a world
8212360	8217480	in which that majestic document was released to some researchers back in the 80s, the IPU reports.
8217480	8222440	And it was kept a little secret until Thomas Cantwheel gave the documents to Timothy Cooper
8222440	8230840	back in 1996, I believe the IPU report was. But I digress, there's nothing to substantiate that
8230840	8236760	theories, but it is interesting nonetheless. And again, this ultra top secret majestic report
8236760	8242680	from the DIA comes out in 2017, telling the Steinman account of Aztec verbatim. So,
8243320	8247960	I'm not quite sure what to do with this document. Perhaps I'll make a majestic documents follow
8247960	8252920	up part two where we can analyze some of the more controversial documents,
8254600	8260200	project Aquarius, maybe this document and some others. So maybe we'll do that in the future.
8260200	8265240	But I'd like to know what you guys think about this video. I mean, I'll tell you what right now.
8265240	8269320	I don't think I've ever said the word doodle bug so much in my life. It was pretty tough
8269320	8274280	recording the script, trying to talk about magnetic anomaly detection devices and Carl
8274280	8282040	Highland and RSI. I mean, geospatial services, Inc. GSI, my apologies, and try and say doodle
8282040	8287160	bug with a straight face. But when I found Texas Instrument in 1980, their 30 year history is
8287160	8292360	saying, Hey, we pay respects to our doodle buggers back in the day. I got a little bit more relaxed
8292360	8298200	about saying such things. So I know in this video, there was a lot of information discussed. And
8298840	8305320	you know, if you're going to purchase one book or pursue one lead after this, I can't recommend
8305320	8311400	enough buying the Ramses book that I have right here. The book is it is fantastic. It is exactly
8311400	8318200	how I like to do research. All sources are always cited. There's a massive reference tab. There's
8318200	8322360	numerous pictures. I mean, there's stuff I didn't even speak about in this video, such as the Ramses
8322360	8327240	hiring, you know, various professionals who weren't even into UFOs to reconstruct how the
8327240	8331880	Hart Canyon roads could have been used to transport the huge disk to Los Alamos. So
8332440	8337240	a ton more groundwork in that book. And, you know, I barely even scratched the surface with it.
8338120	8343560	And of course, we got the big boy here. This step certainly put a dent in my pocket. It's a pretty
8343560	8349320	expensive book. But if I was going to do a video on Aztec, I needed the book. There's so much awesome
8349320	8356280	artwork and some truly astonishing things written by Steinman here. I expressed it multiple times
8356280	8363960	in the video, but I do have frustration. Steinman so cavalierly discusses, as fact, hey, the IPU
8363960	8371320	retrieved the disk, General George Marshall got the call, you know, Highlands, sorry, Oppenheimer,
8371320	8377400	Vannevar Bush, they were all there at the site, especially Chirur and Dr. Detlef Bronck, but
8377400	8384520	doesn't give any, you know, references to his sources or even corroborating evidence. So although
8384520	8389880	he has a ton of exhibits throughout the book, and these include scanned documents, JP Kahn's debunk,
8389880	8396120	Mike McKellen's debunk, Robert Carr's testimony, he does lack there. So that is my biggest critique
8396120	8401160	of the book. But I do think it's excellent, especially the work on Dr. Eric Henry Wang.
8402280	8408760	That is a thread that continues to persist to my research today. Who was Wang? Why can I find
8408760	8417080	nothing about him besides the odd civil engineering atribune to him as he's passed and
8417080	8421400	solely his mention in Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which of course, Arthur Stanzel claimed he worked
8421400	8427800	under Dr. Eric Henry Wang for the Kingman incident and that Dr. Wang spearheaded the
8427800	8432680	reverse engineering and retrieval efforts for that. So the parallels between Aztec, Roswell,
8432680	8438760	and Kingman, I know I said in the video, are endless. These cases seem to be handled and
8438760	8443640	executed the recoveries in an extremely similar manner. You can kind of tell with the Aztec case
8443640	8448440	what's interesting to me is different methods and approaches after the folly that was Roswell.
8449800	8453160	And that included when that knucklehead Silas Newton started talking about the event.
8454120	8460920	Did Carl Highland discuss to Leo Cabauer and Silas Newton? Was he the informant of Aztec?
8460920	8465960	Maybe. I know that Steinman really presses this and I really applaud his theory there.
8466520	8472520	But if we could just have tangible evidence that under Highland's company, Leo Cabauer worked
8472520	8477880	there or Cabauer and Highland worked together in Antarctica in the 30s, like Steinman said,
8479240	8485080	the thesis would be so much stronger. I mean, even if we had evidence that Cabauer worked for Dr. Paul
8485080	8491880	Scherer in the kind of cryogenic containment units meant to freeze the biologics, we'd have so much
8491880	8498200	more to chew on there. And let me know what you think about the court case as well. I've never
8498200	8503720	covered court proceedings before, but I found it pretty interesting, especially Dr. James Meredith
8503720	8508760	of Colorado School of Mines, who was indeed in the same department as Highland, testifying that
8508840	8517240	the Doodle Bug could not find oil, let alone a submarine, and he analyzed war surplus store
8517240	8523560	parts that was quote unquote very similar to the Doodle Bug purchased for $4.45. We also proved
8523560	8528680	whether it's the work of GSI, even patents from Vannevar Bush and other patents that
8528680	8535880	magnetic anomaly detection devices or reflective seismograph technology, both of these, for the
8535880	8542040	sole purpose of finding oil was extensively utilized pre-World War II. And then in World War II,
8542040	8546520	many of the corporations or many of the brightest minds that are working on reflective seismology
8546520	8552040	or MADs to detect oil are brought in by Vannevar Bush to the OSRD to make submarine detecting
8552040	8558840	equipment. So that is relayed by Scully in the 50s for the secret war projects. That is some very
8558840	8563720	tangible stuff to work with. What else do we have that's tangible to work with? We have the Sting
8563720	8571320	operation in 50 from CID and FBI. That is interesting. We have discussions of J. Edgar Hoover
8571320	8577560	messaging about Silas Newton. Now, I don't blame individuals for at the beginning of this video
8577560	8581720	if they made it all through the end first saying, Gerb, why are you covering Aztec? It was proven
8581720	8587080	a hoax. I was victim of this as well. As I said at the beginning of this rant, so was Leonard
8587080	8592680	Stringfield. And I love that in the forward to William Steinman's book Leonard Stringfield said,
8592680	8598600	I was taken by the work of J. Pecan and Bill Moore. Bill Moore, of course, we showed him on
8598600	8603560	the move on Symposium in 89 saying he was working with intelligence agencies. Perhaps Bill Moore,
8603560	8607480	you know, there's some theories floating around that Bill Moore and Richard Doty made some majestic
8607480	8613560	documents. Maybe they had a hand in this puppy right here. But let's discuss Aztec Moore. I
8613560	8618040	say this again, this is just to kickstart research into this case. And I want to know what everybody
8618040	8623080	thinks. And, you know, before we log off for the day, a couple of action items. I was just
8623640	8632920	out of town for a to go on a show. And there I got to meet an individual who's making a documentary.
8634680	8641960	I got a signed poster here from Mr. Luigi. I think it's Vendett Tilley, right?
8642920	8647880	For Project Gravitar. You know, I had been interested in this case in this documentary
8647880	8653000	since I met Chris Ramsey back at the November hearings. And he was telling me all about,
8653000	8656840	hey, you know, I've been talking to Luigi, I've been paying attention to Gravitar,
8656840	8661080	and there's going to be a lot they're talking about Bob Lazar in this new documentary. If you
8661080	8665080	know anything about me, you'll know I've been infatuated with the story of Bob since I was a
8665080	8670920	wee youngster. But I tend not to talk about Bob because I am so biased towards him. And I will
8671080	8676360	always acknowledge that more than anything, I want to believe Bob Lazar. So I tend to
8677240	8683080	not be able to critically analyze pro or con statements with Bob. So I tend to keep him out.
8683080	8690040	But I got to see some stuff with Project Gravitar. And guys, please be excited. This is awesome.
8690040	8694760	This is exactly what I wanted from the Jeremy Corbell documentary. Luigi said to me,
8696360	8700680	you know, maybe I'm putting too much information in. And guys, if you're watching this channel and
8700680	8708280	made it here, we like too much information. So Project Gravitar is very strict on reducing drama,
8708280	8714200	following leads, especially names, full names. You know, you might have heard some names
8714200	8719240	associated with Bob's case, but we're talking full names and identified individuals. And
8720200	8729160	the photorealistic recreated S4 is something to behold. That is wicked, wicked, wicked cool.
8729240	8734120	So yeah, if you see my wall, you already see the sports model drawn by Bob and the propulsion
8734120	8738280	system by Bob. Now I'm going to have this signed Project Gravitar poster by Bob. So
8738840	8744360	it's turned into a bit of a Volkanovski and Bob shrine. If anybody has some awesome artwork
8744360	8748520	they would like to send in, please let me know. And I'll give you kind of like a PO box or a
8748520	8752840	shipping address because I would love to hang up some diagrams, some really cool art on the wall.
8752840	8758920	So please get in contact with me, uapgurb at gmail.com or uapgurb at protonmail.com. And
8758920	8762680	let's get that started because I want to feature some more artwork. Channel wise,
8762680	8765560	I got some huge stuff coming up for the channel that I'm pretty excited about.
8766280	8772200	You know, a lot of huge projects like this. It seems like every project I make these days,
8772200	8776680	I can't really get it under an hour and 45 minutes. So we'll just keep rolling with that.
8776680	8781160	I got some good ideas in the tank and some good stuff coming up outside of the channel too and
8781160	8788600	stuff around the channel. So please keep up with that. Remember guys, I do have a Patreon,
8788600	8793880	I'd love if you went and subscribed and gave me money every month. I don't gatekeep content,
8793880	8797960	so there's no restricted content on there. Or I'll probably start up YouTube memberships as
8797960	8803320	well. So feel free to give me money every month there. I don't gatekeep content. So only give
8803320	8807160	what you think the channel is worth. But if you're not going to do that, totally fine,
8807160	8810760	please at least like and subscribe the video, give me a comment what you think. I am just thrilled
8810760	8815400	that everybody is here watching and I'm incredibly blessed to have people watching the videos,
8815400	8820440	making it all the way through. So thank you so much. And again, let me know what you thought
8820440	8825160	about the Aztec case. This is just the beginning of me talking about it. So with that being said,
8825160	8830120	remember to like and subscribe. Let me know what you think and I will see everybody on the next
8830120	8832520	show. Thank you so much. Bye.
