WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
He called me on an open line out of the blue, and I could barely believe who he was.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.560
His name was Nat Cobitz.

00:08.560 --> 00:15.800
He was the US Navy's former longtime director of science and technology development.

00:15.800 --> 00:22.760
Their chief R&D scientist, their chief geek for many years, for over 30 years.

00:22.760 --> 00:28.040
He was a beautiful guy, and it was an act of courage on his part.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.200
I remember one of the conversations I had with him was,

00:30.200 --> 00:31.840
do you think there's any good reason?

00:31.840 --> 00:35.640
Because this is the thing I wrestle with, and I know you do as well.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.600
What's the dirty secret?

00:37.600 --> 00:39.440
Why can't we know this?

00:39.440 --> 00:43.440
You know, if the US has recovered technology, why can't we know?

00:43.440 --> 00:46.480
And he hadn't been told that.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.440
And he had that rigid doctrinaire thing about how he wasn't read into that part of it.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.880
And that was a compartmentalized issue.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.280
He wasn't entitled to know about.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.920
What he told me was that he'd been told

00:58.920 --> 01:04.240
that the United States had recovered multiple craft, multiple craft.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.800
And he implied very strongly that Roswell and another case

01:07.800 --> 01:11.680
I'm interested in, Aztec and Kingman, all real incidents.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.000
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.960
On this channel, we have covered myriad of UFO crash retrieval cases

01:19.960 --> 01:24.080
ranging from brief overviews to exhaustive, full investigations.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.400
These cases differ greatly.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.000
Some featuring a wealth of witnesses, paper trails or threads of investigation,

01:31.000 --> 01:37.040
such as 1933 Magenta, Italy, 1965 Kexford, Pennsylvania, in 1953,

01:37.040 --> 01:41.520
Kingman, Arizona, while other cases are plagued by a lack of witnesses,

01:41.520 --> 01:46.440
controversy or incomplete investigation, such as 2008 Needles, California,

01:46.440 --> 01:51.240
1950 El Indio, Texas or 1974 Koyame, Mexico.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.440
There is one UFO crash retrieval case that seems to exist somewhere in the middle,

01:56.440 --> 02:02.840
a case that is often overshadowed by the most infamous UFO crash retrieval case of all time,

02:02.840 --> 02:08.680
1947's Roswell, that occurred just eight months after in northern New Mexico.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.800
This case is marred by controversy, yet bolstered by tremendous investigation

02:13.800 --> 02:17.160
and witness testimony, a case that has been debunked,

02:17.160 --> 02:21.640
labeled as a hoax several times over, but yet still refuses to die.

02:21.640 --> 02:27.640
The 25 March 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash retrieval.

02:27.640 --> 02:34.280
This incident to me offers unbridled insights into the complexity of UFO crash retrieval,

02:34.280 --> 02:39.080
while the story of the saucer and biologics retrieval has remained consistent across the

02:39.080 --> 02:44.360
decades from several unconnected first and second hand witnesses and informants.

02:44.360 --> 02:50.360
The accusations and reprisals levied against those who have dared to discuss Aztec are indeed

02:50.360 --> 02:56.760
astounding. I'm sure many watching this video are already apprehensive to hear the word Aztec,

02:56.760 --> 03:00.760
after all, the Aztec crash is not without its problems.

03:00.760 --> 03:07.240
The initial sources of the story, Silas Newton and Leo Jabauer are after all convicted conmen,

03:07.240 --> 03:12.760
so this means the case is a simple hoax as Wikipedia and several UFO researchers like

03:12.760 --> 03:18.280
to point out, right? Or is the reputation of these men and the quality of the endless debunks

03:18.280 --> 03:24.520
against Aztec just as complex as the rest of the story itself? Why in the world would I cover a

03:24.520 --> 03:31.160
case that so many have written off as a hoaxed event perpetuated to sell oil-finding devices?

03:31.160 --> 03:36.680
Taking a step back and analyzing almost 80 years of research on this case reveals to me,

03:36.680 --> 03:43.800
just as William Steinman titled his 1986 book, that Aztec is indeed a well-kept secret.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.600
From similarities with the Aztec crash transport and the words of former director of naval

03:48.600 --> 03:54.280
intelligence Sumner Shapiro in conversation with NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler to the

03:54.280 --> 03:59.320
possible involvement of some of the United States' most legendary scientists including

03:59.320 --> 04:05.960
Vannevar Bush, John von Neumann, and J. Robert Oppenheimer. To bizarre late 40s and early 50s

04:05.960 --> 04:12.920
efforts by US agencies such as AFOSI, Air Force Office of Special Investigation, and FBI's attempts

04:12.920 --> 04:19.560
to intercept photos of the crash disc, every single avenue of the Aztec case is rich with

04:19.560 --> 04:25.880
the call for investigation. The Aztec crash may just give us access to travel back in time

04:25.880 --> 04:32.280
and analyze the fledgling years of UFO legacy program operations. Not only to study how the

04:32.280 --> 04:37.880
United States' top minds were employed to study recovered technologies of unknown origin,

04:37.880 --> 04:43.400
but also to gauge the severity with which UFO retrieval teams would attempt to rectify the

04:43.400 --> 04:50.680
public folly that was the July 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. So, travel back in time with me

04:50.680 --> 04:58.040
to the early morning of 25 March 1948 onto a rocky mesa just 12 miles northeast of Aztec,

04:58.040 --> 05:04.200
New Mexico, and let's investigate the case of an enormous crashed disc of non-human origin

05:04.200 --> 05:09.800
taken into the custody of US military and scientists and the ensuing sophisticated campaign

05:09.800 --> 05:15.880
of organized disinformation. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and I am thrilled for you to join me today

05:15.880 --> 05:23.320
as we discuss a case that in my opinion requires a Herculean amount of analysis and investigation,

05:23.320 --> 05:30.840
the 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash retrieval. This investigation serves to comprehensively

05:30.840 --> 05:37.160
analyze the story of Aztec, the witnesses, sources, and reporters involved, the attempts to prove the

05:37.160 --> 05:43.560
case a hoax, as well as the possible structure of early UFO crash retrieval organizations in the

05:43.560 --> 05:51.160
possible involvement of the ever elusive Majestic 12. So, did a 99.9 foot diameter disc manned by

05:51.160 --> 05:59.160
14 to 16 humanoids really crash just south of Durango, Colorado in 1948? Did Bush, Oppenheimer,

05:59.160 --> 06:04.440
Von Neumann, and other esteemed scientists personally investigate the retrieved disc?

06:04.440 --> 06:09.880
Did the interplanetary phenomenon unit really disassemble and take the craft to Los Alamos

06:09.880 --> 06:15.080
National Labs? Or is this case, just as Wikipedia would have you believe,

06:15.080 --> 06:21.640
just a simple hoax by the con men Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer will join me today as we try and

06:21.640 --> 06:27.560
find out. And before we get started, as I just mentioned, the structure of the Aztec case is

06:27.560 --> 06:33.160
labyrinthine, possibly purposely so, and due to the complexity of this case we will primarily

06:33.160 --> 06:39.160
reference six key sources, three of which are sublime books written about the crash saucer,

06:39.160 --> 06:45.960
the legendary 1950s behind the flying saucers by Frank Scali, which introduced the world to Aztec.

06:45.960 --> 06:52.680
1986's hidden gem, UFO crash at Aztec, a well-kept secret by one of my favorite UFO

06:52.680 --> 06:58.120
researchers, William Steinman, which resurrected the case while naming possible officials and

06:58.120 --> 07:04.760
scientists behind the retrieval. 2015's the Aztec UFO incident, the case, evidence,

07:04.760 --> 07:10.920
an elaborate cover-up of one of the most perplexing crashes in history by Scott and Suzanne Ramsey,

07:10.920 --> 07:15.720
which carefully and excellently evaluates the witnesses and sources of Aztec,

07:15.720 --> 07:20.440
addresses skeptics and debunkers, and carefully evaluates the case as a whole.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.560
The last, which is technically a collection of works, is the legendary UFO researcher Leonard

07:25.560 --> 07:30.920
Stringfield and his magnum opus UFO crash retrieval status reports one through seven,

07:30.920 --> 07:35.880
which introduces a plethora of new witnesses, sources, and information to the case.

07:35.880 --> 07:41.080
You may have noticed here, I only listed four of six sources. Well, this is because we will

07:41.080 --> 07:47.640
also address, study, and evaluate the two major debunks to the New Mexico flying saucer retrieval.

07:47.640 --> 07:53.960
1952's flying saucers and the mysterious little men, written by the jealous JP Kahn,

07:53.960 --> 07:59.800
which shot to destroy the Aztec case, author Frank Scali and Scali sources Silas Newton,

07:59.800 --> 08:06.600
and the amalgamation of nine scientists called Dr. G. Kahn falsely labeled as one singular man,

08:06.600 --> 08:14.120
Leo Gabauer. As well as 1975's, the flying saucer crash of 1948 is a hoax by Mike McKellen,

08:14.120 --> 08:19.240
which released just one year after sources of Leonard Stringfield breathed new life into the

08:19.240 --> 08:25.320
case. Now real fast, last thing, many who watch this channel know Steinman's book is one of the

08:25.320 --> 08:32.680
most elusive and coveted UFO crash retrieval books of all time. After all, only 1,000 copies were

08:32.680 --> 08:37.560
ever printed. But guys, I am thrilled to say for this project, I have purchased this title for

08:37.560 --> 08:44.040
myself so we can enjoy high quality scans of pages and images. And with all that out of the way,

08:44.040 --> 08:45.640
let us finally dive in.

08:45.960 --> 08:55.960
Following the Second World War and sitting at the dawn of the Cold War, the Southern U.S. State of New

08:55.960 --> 09:01.400
Mexico was ripe with atomic energy and weapons development. The state employed numerous high

09:01.400 --> 09:07.000
powered radar installations to defend crown jewel weapons testing in RDT&E facilities,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.960
such as Los Alamos National Labs, White Sands Missile Range, and Sandia National Labs from

09:11.960 --> 09:19.080
Soviet bomber attacks. By 1948, the year of our incident, the elder UFO legacy program Gatekeeping

09:19.080 --> 09:24.920
Structure, the Atomic Energy Commission, was engaged in one project, Twinkle, a program that

09:24.920 --> 09:31.480
analyzed UFOs, including green fireballs at Los Alamos, Sandia, and Holloman Air Force Base.

09:31.480 --> 09:36.440
Therefore, I'd say it's safe for us to assume the Atomic Energy Commission in the newly formed

09:36.440 --> 09:42.440
United States Air Force radars detected an object of unknown origin near Aztec, New Mexico,

09:42.440 --> 09:48.600
roughly 160 miles from Los Alamos. Indeed, sources of William Steinman would appear on record in

09:48.600 --> 09:55.000
1986, claiming the craft was identified by three separate Southwest radar installations.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.360
Viewers of my channel will likely recall mention of Los Alamos and Sandia in almost every single

10:00.360 --> 10:06.440
project I do as engaging in UFO legacy program operations from craft and material housing

10:06.440 --> 10:12.040
to TUO or technologies of unknown origin exploitation, and we will expand on this much

10:12.040 --> 10:18.360
more later on. Numerous eyewitnesses described seeing a low-flying saucer-shaped object wobbling

10:18.360 --> 10:23.880
as if it were in peril, colliding or nearly colliding with nearby mesas until it was seen

10:23.880 --> 10:29.960
crashing in nearby Hart Canyon. The subject of local eyewitnesses to Aztec is of tremendous

10:29.960 --> 10:34.840
importance to our investigation, and we will discuss virtually all publicly named Aztec

10:34.840 --> 10:41.160
witnesses later on in our investigation. Citizens, ranchers, two policemen, and nearby

10:41.160 --> 10:47.240
oil field workers quickly arrived to the crash scene. To this day, it is still unknown what

10:47.240 --> 10:52.520
caused this crash after Roswell. Several researchers believe somehow high-powered radar

10:52.520 --> 10:57.960
interfered with the craft's propulsion systems. These sentiments were shared by Colonel Philip

10:57.960 --> 11:03.400
J. Corso of the U.S. Army Foreign Technology Division, who theorized the Roswell crash just

11:03.400 --> 11:09.080
eight months prior had crashed due to radar interference. This becomes all the more interesting

11:09.080 --> 11:15.720
as we describe this crash retrieval. All eyewitness accounts describe the craft as fully undamaged,

11:15.720 --> 11:20.680
but perhaps there is credence to the theory the craft was down via high-powered radar.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.240
During their boots on the ground crusade to validate or falsify the Aztec crash,

11:25.240 --> 11:31.400
Scott and Suzanne Ramsey met with one Lee Crane. Crane worked in the Aztec area during 1950.

11:31.400 --> 11:38.520
Crane discussed how USAF personnel from the El Vado 767 AC&W radar site originally the

11:38.520 --> 11:43.800
Los Alamos radar installation to protect Los Alamos, and one of the sites likely involved with the

11:43.800 --> 11:49.640
tracking of non-human saucers would frequent the same diner as Crane. These Air Force personnel

11:49.640 --> 11:54.760
would bring in freshly killed, half-cooked ducks that they stated had been knocked out of the air

11:54.760 --> 11:58.680
by powerful microwave radar being used at the facility.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.960
Now viewers of my channel will absolutely recall, as recently as my project on SAIC,

12:03.960 --> 12:09.400
that I frequently discuss how Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative,

12:09.400 --> 12:14.520
built to protect the United States from Soviet ICBMs, secretly engaged in highly

12:14.520 --> 12:20.920
compartmentalized, deep-sixed UFO program operations, some of which harnessed STIs,

12:20.920 --> 12:27.000
lethality, and target hardening or particle beam weapons programs to offensively target UFOs with

12:27.000 --> 12:33.480
microwave or X-ray weaponry. In this project, I discussed how SAIC would have likely been the

12:33.480 --> 12:39.000
prime contractor aiding the SDI in shooting down non-human craft, and quite the interesting

12:39.000 --> 12:44.760
connection here. Possibly, these weapons against UFOs were accidentally discovered during the late

12:44.760 --> 12:52.280
1940s. But now, let's get back to late March 1948 on top of the Hart Canyon Mesa. Consistent

12:52.280 --> 12:57.560
across eyewitness statements ranging from the sources of Skully, Newton, and the Ramses are

12:57.560 --> 13:05.720
reports of an enormous craft measuring 99.9 feet, resting virtually undamaged atop the Mesa at an

13:05.720 --> 13:12.120
angle. Though crashed, could this saucer have landed on its own guidance? The saucer appeared

13:12.120 --> 13:18.280
of a light metal composition, absent from any rivets, bolts, screws, signs of welding,

13:18.280 --> 13:24.120
landing gear, or propulsion systems. In the middle of the bizarre craft sat what appeared to be a

13:24.120 --> 13:31.320
crew cabin, an almost sphere measuring 18 feet in diameter and 6 feet in height. Locals from

13:31.320 --> 13:37.560
Aztec and oilfield workers began to climb aboard the craft, remarking how light the material was.

13:37.640 --> 13:43.000
In quickly on scene, witnesses described a helicopter flying overhead. The site was almost

13:43.000 --> 13:50.040
surreal to eyewitnesses such as Doug Nolan, as the likely Sikorsky H-5 series or Bell H-13 was

13:50.040 --> 13:56.440
quite new technology. Rapidly, men in uniform, unknown if army or air force, as the two were

13:56.440 --> 14:01.880
recently separated, pulled to the scene in jeeps that were befitting of the US Army.

14:01.880 --> 14:06.760
Multiple witness testimonies surrounding Aztec state the recovery effort was conducted out of

14:06.760 --> 14:12.200
the USAF Walker Base in New Mexico. Allegedly, personnel were flown to Durango, Colorado,

14:12.200 --> 14:16.840
where a short drive was completed to the crash site. This will be explored further later by

14:16.840 --> 14:23.400
witnesses such as USAF Airmen known as pseudonym George, and Walker Air Force Base was the new name

14:23.400 --> 14:29.880
for Roswell Army Airfield. The onsite military immediately separated citizens at the crash

14:29.880 --> 14:34.520
site, informing them never to speak about the incident and informing the locals on scene.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.080
The object was extremely important to US national security.

14:39.080 --> 14:43.960
Now, Frank Scully's early 50s recount of Aztec, as informed by Silas Newton,

14:43.960 --> 14:49.880
states investigators onsite were able to gain access to the craft via punctured porthole.

14:49.880 --> 14:55.160
As investigators approached the seemingly glass like windows, they observed these portholes were

14:55.160 --> 15:01.800
not glass, but indeed semi-translucent. Inside the craft, two humanoid bodies were

15:01.800 --> 15:07.320
observed slumped over an instrument panel that appeared to be but four feet high, charred,

15:07.320 --> 15:13.480
and possibly mangled. According to Scully, investigators jammed a wood or metal rod

15:13.480 --> 15:18.280
into the mysteriously punctured porthole poking and prodding at the instrument panel

15:18.280 --> 15:24.520
until a panel opened up giving access to the craft. Inside the vehicle appeared to be a separate

15:24.600 --> 15:30.120
crew cabin where 12 to 14 separate bodies lay dead on the ground.

15:30.120 --> 15:34.520
While the story of the crash, the retrieval process, and the method of gaining entry to

15:34.520 --> 15:39.560
the craft are near identical, Steinman's account introduces far more specific,

15:39.560 --> 15:45.800
such as named onsite scientific retrieval personnel. Steinman writes the 30 to 40-year-old

15:45.800 --> 15:51.560
seasoned military members on scene were members of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, a long

15:51.560 --> 15:57.560
forgotten US Army division shown to Steinman by the Freedom of Information Act to exist solely

15:57.560 --> 16:03.240
through institutional memory. IPU has its own controversy and juicy alleged report in the

16:03.240 --> 16:09.560
Majestic 12 leaks which we will address in a section specifically on IPU. According to Steinman's

16:09.560 --> 16:15.640
sources, the impact area of the craft was relayed to Air Defense Commander General George C. Marshall,

16:15.640 --> 16:20.680
who then contacted the IPU and head of the Majestic 12, the illustrious,

16:20.680 --> 16:25.480
head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush.

16:26.120 --> 16:32.840
Steinman first learned of the existence of IPU in the early 1980s so it is intriguing by 1986.

16:32.840 --> 16:38.680
He had learned the IPU allegedly operated out of Camp Hale, Colorado and served the function

16:38.680 --> 16:44.920
to collect and deliver disabled or crashed disks to certain specific secret locations.

16:44.920 --> 16:51.000
Now, Vannevar Bush in the M.J. 12. Bush is named Adnausium in the Majestic documents,

16:51.000 --> 16:57.160
most famously the Eisenhower Briefing Document as M.J. 1, the head of the secret organization

16:57.160 --> 17:02.360
created under President Harry Truman to act as the original UFO legacy program.

17:02.920 --> 17:09.560
But Bush's ties to UFOs are not solely relegated to the Majestic documents. Later in this project,

17:09.560 --> 17:17.000
we will discuss physicist and prodigy of Einstein, Robert A. Sarbacher, who claimed in 1950 UFO

17:17.000 --> 17:22.680
programs were classified higher than the H-bomb and operated under Vannevar Bush. Keep an eye out

17:22.680 --> 17:29.000
for this section later on. Accompanying Bush in the IPU was a team of eight other scientists we

17:29.000 --> 17:33.960
will touch on when we cover in greater detail Steinman's work, but these included Dr. Robert

17:33.960 --> 17:40.200
J. Oppenheimer, Dr. John von Neumann, and Dr. Detlev Bronk. Four of these men have been labeled

17:40.200 --> 17:47.240
as original Majestic 12 members. On site, according to Steinman's work, the team accessed the craft

17:47.240 --> 17:53.800
via punctured porthole. Inside the cabin sat two humanoid figures, with 12 more bodies littered

17:53.800 --> 18:01.720
across the chamber. With Aztec, we do see varying reports of 12 to 16 bodies. Instrument panels

18:01.720 --> 18:07.960
around the craft wall showed high-tech screens sprawled with glyphic-style writing. From Randy

18:07.960 --> 18:16.200
Anderson to Mark's 1991 Deep Sea Recovery to 1965 Kexburg, glyphic iconography is inseparable

18:16.200 --> 18:22.760
from non-human technology. A quote-unquote book was found inside the craft or better described as a

18:22.760 --> 18:29.240
pamphlet of plastic displaying the same glyphic-style writing. General Marshall allegedly passed this

18:29.240 --> 18:34.760
on to two leading cryptologists, William F. Freedman and Lambrose C. Calihamos,

18:34.760 --> 18:40.680
who were unsuccessful in their attempts to decipher the codes. Physiologist and biophysicist

18:40.680 --> 18:46.600
Dr. Detlev Bronk ordered the bodies to be placed on dry ice. According to Steinman's sources,

18:46.600 --> 18:52.360
Air Research Corporation supplied freezing equipment as director of R&D of the corporation,

18:52.360 --> 18:58.440
Dr. Paul A. Scherer was both a colleague of Vannevar Bush and a cryogenic specialist.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.760
As a quick detour, I do find it rather fascinating in 1954 under the administration

19:04.760 --> 19:10.520
of the recent presidential incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dr. Paul A. Scherer was one

19:10.520 --> 19:16.040
of 12 scientists named onto the board of directors of a group called the American Association for

19:16.040 --> 19:21.800
the Advancement of Science that sought radical changes in the scientific community. This panel

19:21.800 --> 19:27.400
of esteemed scientists sought to harness global scientific advancements for humanity's progress

19:27.400 --> 19:33.080
instead of preserving, quote, the secrecy of scientific knowledge we already have, end quote.

19:33.080 --> 19:39.000
Seen as Dwight D. Eisenhower is often cited as the president who lost control of UFO legacy

19:39.000 --> 19:44.680
programs, who ran an administration in which non-human crash retrieval and material exploitation

19:44.680 --> 19:50.920
programs broke free from traditional oversight channels and gained unprecedented autonomy.

19:50.920 --> 19:56.680
How fascinating is it that Dr. Paul A. Scherer, a scientist alleged to have participated in

19:56.680 --> 20:03.640
non-human biologics retrieval in 1948, desperately sought to see the end of scientific secrecy

20:03.640 --> 20:08.040
under the guise of national security following the Truman administration?

20:08.040 --> 20:13.640
Dr. Bronk would allegedly go on to detail full autopsies for the pilots, which were published in

20:13.640 --> 20:20.200
the legendary Ever Elusive and Deep Sixth Project Blue Book Slash Sign Report Number 13.

20:20.280 --> 20:26.600
These bodies feature disproportionately large heads, slant eyes, small noses, and mouths.

20:26.600 --> 20:31.880
The creatures weighed solely 40 pounds on average with small torsos and thin necks.

20:31.880 --> 20:37.080
The fingers of the creatures were webbed and internal systems revealed no digestive systems

20:37.080 --> 20:43.640
or gastrointestinal tracts, no alimentary or intestinal canal, and no reproductive organs.

20:43.640 --> 20:48.440
Instead of blood, the circulatory system of the creatures was comprised of a colorless

20:48.440 --> 20:54.840
liquid with no red cells that smelled like ozone. These creature descriptions sound near

20:54.840 --> 21:01.640
identical to that of the EBE1 detailed in the controversial yet provocative 1950s Majestic

21:01.640 --> 21:06.280
12 Special Operations Manual 1 I have covered in detail with Ryan Wood.

21:06.280 --> 21:11.320
Now, I must mention here is where there are slight variances between Scully's and Steinman's

21:11.320 --> 21:16.760
description of the biologics. Scully described the beans as almost perfectly humanoid,

21:16.840 --> 21:22.760
just scaled differently with perfect teeth. The retrieval process of the crashed disc at Aztec

21:22.760 --> 21:27.640
took up to two weeks. Helicopters certainly were unable to provide the necessary carrying

21:27.640 --> 21:34.040
capacity to retrieve the 99.9-foot disc, so how in the world was it extracted?

21:34.040 --> 21:39.400
These points here to me offer some of the most fascinating insights into Aztec.

21:39.400 --> 21:45.320
Some non-human craft and incredible testimonies hurt decades after the Aztec event.

21:45.400 --> 21:50.840
The craft was dismantled. The science team figured out the large ring of metal rotated

21:50.840 --> 21:56.920
around the centralized, stabilized cabin. Indeed, the scientists were able to dismantle the craft.

21:56.920 --> 22:01.960
The vehicle was manufactured in segments which fitted into grooves and were pinned together

22:01.960 --> 22:08.840
around the base. The vehicle was divided into the crew cabin in three equal-sized pieces of the disc.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.040
Now, stop me if you've heard this before.

22:12.600 --> 22:18.280
Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security Agency

22:18.280 --> 22:23.320
in the United States, deputy director at CIA, director of Naval Intelligence and a variety of

22:23.320 --> 22:29.960
intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really accurate, that

22:29.960 --> 22:36.440
there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man who had to know. So,

22:36.440 --> 22:42.120
I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the UK.

22:43.080 --> 22:49.880
And this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered under

22:49.880 --> 22:54.040
national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have possession

22:54.040 --> 22:57.960
of the hardware associated with this. In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.800
A craft, a spaceship.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.120
Several of them, and they were in operational condition.

23:02.760 --> 23:07.480
Bobby Ray Inman, one of if not the most critical figure to this channel,

23:07.480 --> 23:12.840
served as director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, a four-star Navy Admiral,

23:12.840 --> 23:18.040
director of Naval Intelligence, deputy director of Central Intelligence, director of the NSA,

23:18.040 --> 23:25.640
and board member of SAIC Wackenhut and possibly DSAI. And Inman seems to connect to every project

23:25.640 --> 23:31.400
I do these days. I have multiple videos where Inman is discussed at length, so I highly recommend

23:31.400 --> 23:37.720
checking out any of these projects. Famously, in a 1989 recorded phone call with NASA mission

23:37.720 --> 23:43.080
specialist Bob Echler, Inman volunteered CIA directorate of science and technology deputy

23:43.080 --> 23:49.720
director and NRO program B director R. Everett Heineman as the person to ask about recovered

23:49.720 --> 23:55.320
UFOs becoming available for technological research. Inman would additionally connect

23:55.320 --> 24:00.360
Bob Echler with another former director of Naval Intelligence, Sumner Shapiro.

24:00.360 --> 24:06.440
In 1989, Echler met Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with the quote-unquote

24:06.440 --> 24:13.160
group that managed UFO information. At this time, Shapiro was retired as DNI and served as an

24:13.160 --> 24:18.360
executive with BDM International. BDM, of course, is another former defense contractor

24:18.360 --> 24:23.400
purchased by Northrop Grumman I have directly accused of being involved with the UFO Legacy

24:23.400 --> 24:29.400
program operations. Shapiro informed Echler, factions within the U.S. possessed extraterrestrial

24:29.400 --> 24:35.400
vehicles that he, Shapiro, had even studied at close quarters. According to the former DNI,

24:35.400 --> 24:39.800
teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them around the country to different

24:39.800 --> 24:45.720
laboratories. The craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an

24:45.720 --> 24:52.040
exact sequence to be put back together. Was Shapiro talking about the Aztec case? After all,

24:52.040 --> 24:58.680
in how many UFO crash retrieval cases do we hear of a craft being dismantled in a complex and

24:58.680 --> 25:05.160
direct method? Let's also focus on this rotatable crew compartment. USAF Master Sergeant Edgar

25:05.160 --> 25:11.400
Fouchet claimed the TR-3B alien reproduction vehicle whose propulsion systems were reverse-engineered

25:11.400 --> 25:17.320
by Lawrence Livermore Labs and Sandia National Labs from non-human propulsion systems featured a

25:17.320 --> 25:23.160
rotatable crew compartment within the triangle. The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring called

25:23.160 --> 25:28.520
the magnetic field disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything

25:28.520 --> 25:33.560
you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore laboratories developed a reverse

25:33.560 --> 25:39.000
engineered MFD and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology

25:40.200 --> 25:42.360
but you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you.

25:43.320 --> 25:49.080
Anyways, after careful dismantling of the craft, multiple concrete pads still available to this

25:49.080 --> 25:56.120
day were constructed to assist three M25 Dragon wagon tank transports which were stored in New

25:56.120 --> 26:02.200
Mexico bases post-World War II. Indeed, the Ramses were able to find Bureau of Reclamation

26:02.200 --> 26:08.200
records from 1948 discussing heavy earth moving equipment, cranes, and low-boys being used to

26:08.200 --> 26:14.200
move concrete and steel structures in Aztec for the Manco's project. Mention of the Bureau of

26:14.200 --> 26:19.720
Reclamation possibly supplying equipment for moving of the Aztec craft gives us means to pause

26:19.720 --> 26:25.240
and reflect. Seen as in works prior, I have discussed tunneling contracts for tunnel boring

26:25.240 --> 26:30.920
machines under the Bureau of Reclamation secretly engaging in clandestine operations to aid in

26:30.920 --> 26:36.040
the construction of deep underground military bases in their alleged connective tunnel systems.

26:36.680 --> 26:42.680
The convoy carrying enormous pieces of a disk avoided roads to Aztec and drove the wreckage

26:42.680 --> 26:48.360
to Los Alamos National Labs. The bodies were transported away, likely to write patterns in

26:48.360 --> 26:54.120
Air Force Base, and the craft remained at Los Alamos for over a year before being transported

26:54.120 --> 26:59.800
again. The craft being shipped around serves as another nod to Shapiro, no? And quickly,

26:59.800 --> 27:05.000
just in case you are unfamiliar with my other work, mention of Los Alamos as the first destination

27:05.000 --> 27:10.760
for the craft is of massive consequence. I've previously discussed extensive ties with Los

27:10.760 --> 27:15.800
Alamos National Labs, a Department of Energy federally funded research and development center,

27:15.800 --> 27:22.280
and deep underground military bases, UFO legacy program gatekeepers, possible material exploitation

27:22.280 --> 27:28.360
programs, etc. But relevant to today's discussion, let's look back to 1994 to the

27:28.360 --> 27:34.920
words of former New Mexico State Representative J. Andrew Kistner. Kistner stated sources within

27:34.920 --> 27:40.840
White Sands Proving Ground and the Naval Research Lab informed him that two to four flying disks

27:40.840 --> 27:47.400
were recovered during 1947 and 1948, and the disks were possessed and analyzed by both

27:47.400 --> 27:53.080
Los Alamos National Labs and Sandia National Labs 7th Division under control of the Atomic

27:53.080 --> 27:59.320
Energy Commission. Kistner's sources claimed that institutions such as MIT, Brookhaven National

27:59.320 --> 28:04.840
Labs, the Rand Corporation, and Joint Research and Development Board, created partly and shared

28:04.840 --> 28:11.160
by Dr. Vannevar Bush, played a quote unquote major role following the 1947 crashes.

28:11.720 --> 28:15.720
Additionally prudent to Aztec, Kistner mentioned Project Supremacy,

28:15.720 --> 28:22.440
a possible UFO related program created in 1947 that operated specifically to track and perform

28:22.440 --> 28:29.400
data acquisition on triangulated New Mexico radar sites. The New Mexico State Rep would even state

28:29.400 --> 28:36.040
his sources claimed presidential executive order signed in 1948 allowed the Atomic Energy Commission

28:36.040 --> 28:41.240
full custody of the recovered disks with the National Security Council serving as program

28:41.240 --> 28:46.280
coordinator with support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Naval Research Laboratory,

28:46.280 --> 28:52.520
and Dr. Bush's Research and Development Board. One might recall here how Dr. Eric Davis spoke

28:52.520 --> 28:58.360
of PEEDS, a presidential emergency action document signed in the 50s by President Eisenhower to

28:58.360 --> 29:05.320
structure UFO legacy program operations outside of congressional oversight. In fact, post-Roswell

29:05.320 --> 29:12.520
early July 1947, leading up to the morning of 25 March 1948, we may have even more actionable

29:12.520 --> 29:17.960
intelligence that signifies elements of the United States government and military were actively

29:17.960 --> 29:25.560
engaging in establishing programs to deal with recovered non-human craft. On 29 January 1947,

29:25.560 --> 29:31.960
Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy, original accused MJ12 member and

29:31.960 --> 29:39.160
likely murder victim James V. Forestall, established AFSWP, the Armed Forces Special

29:39.160 --> 29:46.200
Weapons Project. This AFSWP was tasked to manage nuclear weapons jointly staffed by U.S. Army and

29:46.200 --> 29:55.000
Navy. At this time, the AFSWP operated within Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs. As we know

29:55.080 --> 30:03.000
from the 2023 and 2024 UAPDA legislation, UFO data, materials, etc., have historically been

30:03.000 --> 30:10.440
misclassified as trans-classified foreign nuclear information under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement.

30:10.440 --> 30:17.080
This threat is indeed intriguing that possibly the AFSWP out of Los Alamos and Sandia handled

30:17.080 --> 30:22.760
the wreckage of both the Roswell and Aztec crashes and served as the foundation out of which the

30:22.760 --> 30:29.560
Atomic Energy Commission established a 1954 agreement to obfuscate and hide UFO data.

30:30.440 --> 30:35.320
But now that we have covered the basis of the Aztec crash, let's really start to dive in.

30:40.440 --> 30:46.360
The Aztec crash made its way into the public zeitgeist with Frank Scully's 1950 best-selling

30:46.360 --> 30:51.560
book Behind the Flying Saucers. Though Scully had previously written about this incident in

30:51.560 --> 30:57.640
1949 in two variety magazine columns, Behind the Flying Saucers served as a

30:57.640 --> 31:03.240
second real book on flying saucers after Donald Keyhoe's Flying Saucers are real.

31:03.240 --> 31:08.600
Scully's book truly served as the impetus for conversations between physicist and consultant

31:08.600 --> 31:14.120
to Vannevar Bush's Research and Development Board Robert Sarbacher and Canadian radio engineer

31:14.120 --> 31:20.120
Wilbert B. Smith that would ultimately lead to Canada's first two official programs on UFOs,

31:20.120 --> 31:25.640
Project Magnet and Second Story. We will expand on this much later in the investigation,

31:25.640 --> 31:32.120
and I also have an entire video on Sarbacher. But Wilbert B. Smith asking Sarbacher about

31:32.120 --> 31:37.320
Frank Scully's best seller and how much of it was ultimately true led to one of the most

31:37.320 --> 31:42.920
fascinating memos of all time. Sarbacher informs Smith that not only the contents of

31:42.920 --> 31:48.440
Behind the Flying Saucers were fundamentally correct, but also that flying saucers exist.

31:48.440 --> 31:53.880
The subject of UFOs is classified in the United States even higher than the H-bomb.

31:53.880 --> 31:59.000
And efforts to capture and study UFOs were spearheaded by Vannevar Bush.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.760
Scully's book reported the Aztec incident as we discussed prior. Besides the data from Steinman,

32:04.760 --> 32:11.560
which we identified, Scully also reported that up to 1950 there had been four such recoveries.

32:11.560 --> 32:17.400
Within the book, Scully suggested based on his plentiful sources, UFOs operated on magnetic

32:17.400 --> 32:23.240
principles, and that finally brings us to Scully's sources, the linchpin of this entire video.

32:24.040 --> 32:30.360
Scully's source of the Aztec crash was one Mr. Silas M. Newton, a complicated, questionable,

32:30.360 --> 32:36.760
and intriguing character who requires ample time to investigate, as well as Mr. G,

32:36.760 --> 32:42.520
an amalgamation of up to eight scientists. Newton claimed no first-hand experience with

32:42.520 --> 32:48.280
the crash retrieval, bar-handling equipment retrieved, souvenirs claimed in pieces taken from

32:48.280 --> 32:54.360
the crash. Newton's information came to him from his close, first-hand confidence, the enigmatic

32:54.360 --> 33:02.440
Mr. G. Indeed, a 1952 debunk on Aztec attempted to label Mr. G as just one man, the equally

33:02.440 --> 33:09.160
complicated Leo Gabauer, but this is simply not the case. Using the work of Suzanne and Scott Ramsey,

33:09.160 --> 33:14.440
as well as William Steinman, we will actually attempt to name as many of the Mr. G's as

33:14.440 --> 33:19.480
possible later in this investigation. After all, throughout the book, Scully would describe the

33:19.480 --> 33:25.160
collection of G's as having, quote, more degrees than a thermometer, end quote. Scully and Newton

33:25.160 --> 33:30.680
would take these names with them to the grave. Scully first heard of the Aztec event from Silas

33:30.680 --> 33:36.840
Newton, owner of the Newton Oil Company with a truly checkered past. The two had a relationship

33:36.840 --> 33:42.040
for multiple years, and early on when discussing flying saucers, Newton invited Scully to the

33:42.040 --> 33:47.800
Mojave Desert to test an oil-finding device called a doodle bug that Newton would later

33:47.800 --> 33:53.880
on face charges for, a fraudulent device that may just have more basis in reality than Hoke's

33:53.880 --> 33:59.960
arguments would admit. Newton would introduce Scully to Dr. G, and Dr. G would tell Scully

33:59.960 --> 34:05.320
much of what we had covered today, the recovery being intact, low salamos retrieving the vehicle,

34:05.320 --> 34:10.840
the craft operated by magnetism, and that some sort of plastic pamphlet was found in the craft

34:10.840 --> 34:17.640
with symbols that were not successfully deciphered. Dr. G infamously showed Scully a cube-like device

34:17.640 --> 34:23.160
that admitted sounds like a radio, and small gear-like objects and discs that they claimed

34:23.160 --> 34:28.600
originated from the Aztec craft, implying these men were actually at the crash site.

34:28.600 --> 34:33.560
The men would even show Scully images of the craft, and keep this in mind as these images

34:33.560 --> 34:38.680
will become important throughout the video, even Scully's widow claimed she had personally seen

34:38.680 --> 34:44.360
these photographs. But Scully wasn't the first person to whom Silas Newton would disclose

34:44.360 --> 34:49.960
information on Aztec. No, after receiving information about the crash from the enigmatic

34:49.960 --> 34:56.120
pool of Mr. G, likely scientists with whom Newton had previously worked alongside in the oil industry,

34:56.120 --> 35:01.640
and before the publishing of Behind the Flying Saucers, Newton had lectured on the crash event

35:01.640 --> 35:08.920
at the University of Denver on 8 March 1950 under the pseudonym Scientist X. At this lecture,

35:08.920 --> 35:14.520
Newton took the place of the original speaker, possibly a Mr. G, and discussed the flying saucer

35:14.520 --> 35:20.440
crash in an effort to interest the students in UFOs. Thankfully, radio salesman and engineer

35:20.440 --> 35:26.040
George Kohler from Denver KMYR who was friends with Newton and possibly some of the Mr. Gs

35:26.040 --> 35:31.240
helped set up this event. Kohler investigated the lecture, and thanks to the Ramsay's keen

35:31.240 --> 35:36.360
research skills, both the recording as well as items from Newton's drawings on the chalkboard

35:36.360 --> 35:42.440
were found in Scully's archive. In this 1950 lecture, Newton discussed a crash of a flying

35:42.440 --> 35:49.160
saucer that occurred two years prior in a 500 mile radius to Denver, drew details of the craft

35:49.160 --> 35:55.000
seen on screen now, and discussed complex magnetism as the craft's propulsive force.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.240
Clearly, this lecture did not go unnoticed, as the day after the lecture,

35:59.240 --> 36:04.360
months before the release of Scully's bestseller, Air Force Office of Special Investigation visited

36:04.360 --> 36:11.000
KMYR Denver looking for Kohler. After two days of trying, Kohler was interrogated by Special Agent

36:11.000 --> 36:16.520
Hansen in Unger about Newton, flying saucers, possible cube-like radios retrieved from the

36:16.520 --> 36:22.360
crash, and more. Thanks to the Ramsay's again for finding and reproducing this interrogation,

36:22.360 --> 36:27.400
in a bizarre twist of events following Newton's lecture on the saucer and the release of behind

36:27.400 --> 36:32.840
the flying saucers in September of 1950, multiple other U.S. agencies were tracking

36:32.840 --> 36:39.720
leads and leaks on the Aztec crash. On 30 September 1950, the Army CID, or Criminal

36:39.720 --> 36:45.080
Investigation Division, reported that a sting operation was staged at the Edelweiss Bar in

36:45.080 --> 36:51.560
Melwyn Hotel in Denver. FBI and CID were trying to intercept the sale of photographs of the

36:51.560 --> 36:58.280
Aztec saucer from one LD McLaughlin to Mr. Klein from the Baltimore Sun. The Ramsay's filed

36:58.280 --> 37:03.720
Freedom of Information Act requests for more documents than the scant few we possess,

37:03.720 --> 37:09.880
but were informed that all were destroyed, and in another fork in the road, there was no Mr. Klein

37:09.880 --> 37:15.640
that worked for the Baltimore Sun at this time. So six months after Newton discussed the Aztec

37:15.640 --> 37:21.880
crash at the University of Denver, the FBI and CID attempted to intercept photos of the crash,

37:21.880 --> 37:25.080
and remember, Scully's widow claimed to see such photos.

37:30.280 --> 37:35.400
Shortly after the release of behind the flying saucers, the case was at large labeled a hoax

37:35.400 --> 37:42.120
due to a September 1952 publication by San Francisco Chronicle writer J. P. Kahn. Kahn

37:42.120 --> 37:46.920
effectively killed the story by making the retrieval appear phony, discrediting Scully

37:46.920 --> 37:53.720
in his most damaging act, discrediting Scully's sources, Newton and Dr. G. After all, around the

37:53.720 --> 38:00.360
time of J. P. Kahn's article, Newton and one Dr. G, Leo Gabauer, who Kahn labeled as the singular

38:00.360 --> 38:06.680
man behind Dr. G, were charged with defrauding Denver businessman Herman Flater. Around the use

38:06.680 --> 38:13.320
of an oil-finding device we discussed called the Doodle Bug. This damning publication and context

38:13.320 --> 38:19.160
around Kahn, Newton, and Gabauer's charges are well worth our time and analysis, as there is

38:19.160 --> 38:24.440
far more here than meets the eye, including questioning the sourcing methods and honesty

38:24.440 --> 38:31.720
of the hero of the hoax, J. P. Kahn. To quote the Ramses for decades, the 1948 Aztec crash

38:31.800 --> 38:37.800
has looked like this quote. Frank Scully's story was going along great until a top shelf

38:37.800 --> 38:43.320
journalist by the name of J. P. Kahn broke the big story of a bunch of Kahn men who had robbed

38:43.320 --> 38:48.680
poor investors out of their life savings in a worthless oil scheme so that they were destitute

38:48.680 --> 38:55.320
and standing in bread lines. Thank God for J. P. Kahn. He saved the day by exposing these Kahn men

38:55.320 --> 39:00.680
who were taking in money and never paying a dime back. These horrible Kahn men were arrested and

39:00.760 --> 39:06.440
sent off to jail, and the Aztec story was nothing more than a fiction concocted by a bunch of bad

39:06.440 --> 39:12.360
and nasty crooks. End quote. While Newton is far from the only source and witness of Aztec,

39:12.360 --> 39:17.960
the story has largely been marred and labeled a hoax due to Kahn's damning piece on Newton.

39:17.960 --> 39:24.120
Predating behind the flying saucers, Scully and Kahn actually shared history. In 1949,

39:24.120 --> 39:29.320
Kahn approached Scully when he got wind of the saucer story in Variety Magazine. Kahn wished to

39:29.320 --> 39:35.560
capitalize off of the craze that was flying saucers. Kahn attempted to purchase the flying

39:35.560 --> 39:41.000
saucer story for the San Francisco Chronicle from Scully in a disgraceful lowball.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.360
The two failed to agree to terms with Scully defiantly resting on his laurels of the validity

39:46.360 --> 39:52.200
of the story over any amount of money. Strangely, Kahn returned to the Chronicle claiming to his

39:52.200 --> 39:57.720
superiors that he and Scully had actually agreed to terms. During these failed business

39:57.720 --> 40:03.480
dealings, Scully had introduced Kahn to Newton at Scully's home. Kahn became almost obsessed with

40:03.480 --> 40:08.600
Newton and the Aztec story, following Newton to San Francisco to get a one and a half hour

40:08.600 --> 40:13.000
meeting with the oilman. Newton would write regarding the dinner with Kahn, quote,

40:13.000 --> 40:18.440
the talk was saucers, saucers. The theme of their talk was that I owed something to the world and

40:18.440 --> 40:24.760
I should let the Chronicle guide me end quote. End quote. The meeting lasted one and a half hours.

40:24.760 --> 40:29.480
They wanted their great conservative paper to get to the bottom, document the whole thing,

40:29.480 --> 40:35.320
and if they thought it was true, then give it to the world, end quote. Ironically, Newton also said,

40:35.320 --> 40:41.000
quote, they would satisfy anyone that they would protect the identity of all concerned, end quote.

40:41.640 --> 40:46.600
Kahn would fully turn his story pitch away from Scully towards Newton, wishing for Newton to

40:46.680 --> 40:55.640
assemble the entire roster of Dr. G for $25,000 in 1952 money in 50% royalties in any publication.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.720
Kahn would famously state in his debunk that during these meetings with Newton,

40:59.720 --> 41:05.480
Silas showed him quote unquote gears from the crash site. But dubiously, Kahn would steal one of

41:05.480 --> 41:11.480
these pieces, have it tested, and determine the relic was simply common aluminum. Now as it turns

41:11.480 --> 41:16.920
out, these pieces from a saucer given to Newton were indeed copies, and while Newton and Scully

41:16.920 --> 41:21.560
had more than likely seen the real collection of items from Dr. G, the items in Newton's

41:21.560 --> 41:27.560
possessions were little more than replicas. This approach by Newton does make logical sense here.

41:27.560 --> 41:34.440
Recall in 1950, AFOSI interrogating radio salesman Kohler about parts from a flying saucer the day

41:34.440 --> 41:40.680
after Newton's University of Denver lecture. In addition, recall how the FBI and Army CID were

41:40.680 --> 41:47.560
actively hunting Aztec photos. JP Kahn would, as a nail in the coffin to Aztec, label one Mr.

41:47.560 --> 41:54.840
Leo Gabauer as the sole Dr. G and implicate the two men in oil fraud. So before we move on to this

41:54.840 --> 42:01.320
criminal case that effectively shredded Newton, Scully, Dr. G, and Aztec, let's go ahead and

42:01.320 --> 42:07.400
dive into Gabauer. Leo A. Gabauer was a phoenix based physical scientist that specialized in

42:07.400 --> 42:13.000
magnetics. Gabauer was a known associate and friend of Newton, and one of the inventors

42:13.000 --> 42:18.120
refers to harness the oil-finding devices infamously called the Doodle Bug.

42:18.120 --> 42:23.560
Now quickly, I have seen some reports that state Newton and Gabauer claimed the Doodle Bug operated

42:23.560 --> 42:29.240
off of non-human technology recovered at Aztec. I have never seen any of these statements from

42:29.240 --> 42:35.400
Newton, Gabauer, or Scully that claim this. In fact, the Doodle Bug seemingly has far more basis

42:35.400 --> 42:41.880
in scientific reality that we will discuss soon. In his debunked piece, Kahn defiantly stated Gabauer

42:41.880 --> 42:47.960
was the sole Dr. G and Newton had informed him of such. The basis for this claim, none.

42:48.760 --> 42:55.080
Gabauer would continuously state in writing, sworn in court, etc., that he was not Dr. G,

42:55.080 --> 43:01.960
so Gabauer was not the Mr. G, but was he a Mr. G? This point is extremely interesting,

43:01.960 --> 43:07.240
as Gabauer may have been in fact one of the Dr. G's relaying information to Newton,

43:07.240 --> 43:10.680
but like everything with this story, nothing is so simple.

43:10.680 --> 43:16.920
In 1986, Steinman would suggest Gabauer and Newton were a targeted leak of information from

43:16.920 --> 43:23.560
none other than a real Dr. G, Majestic 12 member, and scientist on site for the Aztec crash,

43:23.560 --> 43:29.320
Dr. Carl A. Highland. Dr. Highland was the founder and owner of the Highland Research

43:29.320 --> 43:34.200
and Exploration Company based in Denver. Highland was born in Hamburg, Germany, attended the

43:34.200 --> 43:40.120
universities of Heidelberg and Hamburg, gaining his directorate in the latter in 1923,

43:40.120 --> 43:45.960
destined for a career in geology and geophysics. Highland came to the US in 1935,

43:45.960 --> 43:50.280
where he worked as a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines,

43:50.280 --> 43:55.400
and operated within the nearby oil fields. During his time in Colorado, Highland worked

43:55.480 --> 44:00.520
alongside many of the scientists we will discuss in this chapter, and more than likely engaged

44:00.520 --> 44:06.360
with Leo Gabauer for work on magnetic detection devices as well as successful Denver-based

44:06.360 --> 44:12.200
oil man Silas M. Newton. Some even suggest Highland was originally the scientist X,

44:12.200 --> 44:17.480
supposed to speak at the 1950 University of Denver lecture until Newton took his place.

44:18.120 --> 44:23.480
Researchers outside of Steinman have come to the same conclusion, such as one Richard Ogden,

44:23.480 --> 44:28.840
who wrote in his 1960s unpublished book that he deduced the field of scientist who could in

44:28.840 --> 44:35.400
fact be Dr. G, based on Solly's description and arrived at one Dr. Carl A. Highland.

44:35.400 --> 44:40.280
After all, Scully would state one of the Mr. G's lived in Denver and was able to fly to

44:40.280 --> 44:45.880
the Aztec crash site in two or three hours and that Newton drove with him from Denver to Phoenix.

44:46.440 --> 44:51.880
But let's get back to Scully, Newton, Kahn, Gabauer, and the story of the court case.

44:51.880 --> 44:56.600
After failing to purchase the saucer story from Scully and Newton, being duped by the

44:56.600 --> 45:03.000
copy parts after stealing from Silas, and whether malice or ignorance falsely labeled Dr. G as one

45:03.000 --> 45:09.960
Leo Gabauer, J.P. Kahn acted on his vendetta to destroy the Aztec story, both on paper and behind

45:09.960 --> 45:16.600
the scenes. This can be confirmed in a 15 June 1952 letter from Scully to the attorney of Silas

45:16.600 --> 45:22.840
M. Newton, A. Brigham Rose. The letter discusses Kahn approaching Scully in 1949 when he got

45:22.840 --> 45:29.160
wind of Aztec from Scully's Variety Magazine article. By 1951, Kahn had tried and failed

45:29.160 --> 45:34.360
repeatedly to purchase the story. Kahn quickly became obsessed with Newton and admitted to

45:34.360 --> 45:40.280
Scully he had stolen Newton's replica craft material and replaced it with slug. The letter

45:40.280 --> 45:47.000
additionally stated by late 1951, Kahn visited Scully saying he had been duped, claiming Newton

45:47.000 --> 45:52.520
and G were to be arrested, that he wanted the hoax exposed and to be written under Scully's name,

45:52.520 --> 45:56.680
otherwise they would accuse Scully of being involved in the hoax as well.

45:56.680 --> 46:05.320
On 25 April 1951, J.P. Kahn wrote to J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI regarding Silas Newton.

46:05.320 --> 46:10.440
The letter stated that Newton had leaked the Aztec case to Scully and that he was a man with

46:10.440 --> 46:16.680
a checkered criminal history. Kahn also tipped off Hoover that Newton was engaged in the preparation

46:16.680 --> 46:23.160
of a hoax or swindle of large proportions. Strangely enough, the director of the FBI found

46:23.160 --> 46:30.440
time to reply by 3 May 1951 stating the FBI was, quote, to determine if Newton is violating

46:30.440 --> 46:35.160
federal statutes in claiming to be engaged in government research of a secret nature

46:35.160 --> 46:40.280
or in the perpetration of a hoax or swindle of large proportions, end quote.

46:40.280 --> 46:46.920
By 15 May 1951, Kahn responded to Hoover alerting that director information had been made available

46:46.920 --> 46:53.080
to FBI special agents regarding Newton's activities. Now, I find it extremely odd the

46:53.080 --> 46:59.320
director of the FBI would find time to reply to a San Francisco Chronicle writer within a month.

46:59.320 --> 47:04.840
Perhaps as FBI and CID were conducting sting operations to intercept Aztec photographs

47:04.840 --> 47:11.240
in 1950, the bureau was keen to chase down any leads surrounding the Aztec case.

47:11.240 --> 47:17.320
After all, the FBI did have a bizarre file on Newton written roughly one year prior on 31

47:17.320 --> 47:23.800
March 1950. This letter also written to Hoover stated that allegedly a redacted name was told

47:23.800 --> 47:30.760
to have said to another redacted man, Silas Newton, aka Mr. X, had knowledge of a flying disc in

47:30.760 --> 47:36.440
recovered bodies. Some of the details here are incorrect, of course. However, it is intriguing

47:36.440 --> 47:42.120
the FBI was already keeping tabs on Newton just a few short weeks after his Denver lecture on

47:42.120 --> 47:48.040
saucers. And just a few short weeks after, AFOSI interrogated the man who recorded the

47:48.040 --> 47:54.120
lecture, George Kohler. I also find it equally fascinating Scott and Suzanne Ramsey pried

47:54.120 --> 48:02.760
289 pages of Silas Newton documents from the FBI, yet the bureau claimed 100 plus pages were still

48:02.760 --> 48:08.360
unreleasable. The FBI did register multiple documents on Newton before Khan got to them.

48:08.360 --> 48:15.560
One file dated 18 February 1941 reported that, quote, Silas Newton had a very substantial income,

48:15.560 --> 48:20.840
good character, good habits, and no record of lawsuit, collections, or bankruptcy. Both his

48:20.840 --> 48:25.880
companies were reputable concerns, and there was no indication of espionage activities,

48:25.880 --> 48:32.120
end quote. Now of course, the time period of FBI and J. Edgar Hoover investigating Newton

48:32.120 --> 48:39.800
does encourage us to reflect on the 1950 HODL memo. On 22 March 1950, J. Edgar Hoover received an

48:39.800 --> 48:45.160
official memorandum from Washington Special Agent Guy HODL concerning information on flying

48:45.160 --> 48:51.800
saucers. The memo discussed information relayed to Special Agent R. H. Kurtzman by police Special

48:51.800 --> 48:57.720
Investigator Carl Howe and his unnamed informant. According to the memo, an Air Force investigator

48:57.720 --> 49:03.240
stated three flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico, measuring 50 feet in diameter with

49:03.240 --> 49:09.800
raised centers, manned by humanoid biologics that measured three feet tall dressed in metallic cloth

49:09.800 --> 49:15.560
of a very fine texture. These saucers were apparently found in New Mexico due to high-powered

49:15.560 --> 49:21.400
radar setup in New Mexico interfering with saucer mechanisms. Until this memo was released fully

49:21.400 --> 49:26.120
redacted, many thought the source of this information was Newton. While the memo discussed

49:26.120 --> 49:32.600
crafts similar to Aztec, albeit off-dimension-wise, it is intriguing to continuously hear descriptions

49:32.600 --> 49:38.360
of high-powered radar interfering with craft mechanics. Anyways, I digress.

49:38.360 --> 49:44.680
Khan's outreach to the FBI was very successful. Khan additionally located one Herman Flater,

49:44.680 --> 49:50.760
a Denver businessman who had a series of successful, poor, and speculative business deals.

49:50.760 --> 49:55.400
Flater had invested large sums of money into Newton's oil wells, which paid him pretty

49:55.400 --> 50:01.160
handsome royalties. And the doodle bug, Flater was convinced would make him millions of dollars.

50:01.160 --> 50:06.120
Recall the doodle bug was a term used for an electronic sensing equipment device used to

50:06.120 --> 50:11.080
find oil, gas, water, and whatever else the inventor claimed the unit could locate.

50:11.640 --> 50:16.840
Khan told Flater, quote, you will never see a nickel of your investment because you,

50:16.840 --> 50:22.360
my friend, have been victim of a Khan artist, end quote. This quote was reported in Frank

50:22.360 --> 50:27.720
Scully's book, Armor Bright. Over his dealings with Khan, Flater was convinced the two men

50:27.720 --> 50:34.200
should seek the FBI to pursue legal action against Newton. In 1951, Flater eventually

50:34.200 --> 50:39.240
wished, with the aid of the FBI, to file a criminal case against Newton in his compatriot

50:39.240 --> 50:46.520
of the doodle bug, Leo Gabauer. As he decided, he felt hustled out of 250 grand by the two men.

50:46.520 --> 50:52.600
Again odd, as Flater was actively receiving royalties from Newton's successful oil fields.

50:52.600 --> 50:56.840
Flater would claim that every time Gabauer utilized the doodle bug machine,

50:56.840 --> 51:02.520
he had positive results. However, every time Flater would use the device, nothing happened.

51:02.600 --> 51:08.920
Curiously, the FBI could not find one federal judge to entertain a federal criminal case in

51:08.920 --> 51:14.920
Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, all states in which Newton conducted business.

51:14.920 --> 51:19.320
Flater's attorney eventually went to a magistrate in Denver to prosecute the case

51:19.320 --> 51:25.880
locally, and charges were filed on 10 October 1952. The initial charges levied at Newton in

51:25.880 --> 51:31.320
Gabauer was, quote, interstate transportation of stolen property, end quote, which was defined

51:31.320 --> 51:37.080
as Newton transporting Herman Flater's personal checks across state lines to California to deposit

51:37.080 --> 51:42.440
them into his bank account. The next charges levied were quote unquote worthless machinery,

51:42.440 --> 51:49.640
which led to the arrest of Gabauer in Phoenix and Newton in Los Angeles on 18 October 1952.

51:49.640 --> 51:56.200
Whilst building the case, the FBI found 32 of 33 of Newton and Gabauer's investors were quite

51:56.280 --> 52:00.840
pleased with their investments. Flater was the standout pressing charges.

52:00.840 --> 52:07.720
The trial started on 10 November 1953, and proceedings lasted until 29 December 1953,

52:07.720 --> 52:13.400
when Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer were found guilty of fraud. Based on the work of William

52:13.400 --> 52:19.560
Steinman analyzing court records, it is crucial to analyze how this case was prosecuted.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.760
Disgruntled businessman Herman Flater was the first prosecution witness to take the stand,

52:24.760 --> 52:30.360
presenting his main complaint as his, quote, inability to operate Gabauer's oil detecting

52:30.360 --> 52:35.720
device, end quote. Flater's testimony lasted two weeks, and again, he felt as though Newton

52:35.720 --> 52:44.120
and Gabauer defrauded him of $250,000. On 17 November 1953, the defense for Gabauer presented,

52:44.120 --> 52:49.800
as evidence, a signed contract by Flater that gave him interest in three of the oil detecting

52:49.800 --> 52:55.080
devices in return for his investment. Flater strangely denied signing these documents,

52:55.080 --> 52:59.240
however, eyewitnesses testified to observing Flater's sign.

52:59.240 --> 53:06.440
On 20 November 1953, prosecution called Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Professor Dr. James

53:06.440 --> 53:11.560
Meredith to the stand. Meredith was asked as an expert in geophysical exploration,

53:11.560 --> 53:16.760
if he could prove Gabauer's doodle bugs were legitimate tools. Meredith was shown a device

53:16.760 --> 53:23.000
that was, quote, unquote, very similar to Gabauer's oil detecting tool, but not his device.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.280
The device presented in court was one that the district attorney had purchased at a local war

53:28.280 --> 53:35.960
surplus store for $4.45 and was, quote, very similar to the one Gabauer used, end quote.

53:35.960 --> 53:40.760
The Colorado School of Mines doctor testified regarding the false instrument, quote,

53:40.760 --> 53:47.160
these so-called doodle bugs couldn't detect submarines, much less oil and or gas deposits,

53:47.160 --> 53:52.200
end quote. A second witness, this time a research engineer for the University of Denver,

53:52.200 --> 53:58.520
examined the same knockoff devices and testified that it, quote, couldn't find anything, end quote.

53:58.520 --> 54:04.200
Now let's also take a look at the defense here. Defense attorney Melman served Flater with a subpoena,

54:04.200 --> 54:09.400
ordering Flater to produce a small health machine he supposedly produced and sold part

54:09.400 --> 54:15.640
interest into Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer. So in the same exchange of interest here to this court

54:15.640 --> 54:21.320
case, Flater was buying into the oil detecting device, but Flater was also trying to sell Newton

54:21.320 --> 54:27.480
and Gabauer on a nebulous, quote unquote, health machine. The judge bizarrely decided that this

54:27.480 --> 54:33.160
health machine was not relevant to the case. The second witness called by defense testified

54:33.160 --> 54:39.240
with photo evidence that Gabauer had successfully located three water wells on his company property.

54:39.480 --> 54:45.720
Additional witnesses claimed Gabauer's device had successfully found oil on their 100,000 acre

54:45.720 --> 54:53.400
land, quote, Mr. Gabauer's machine defined 35 oil wells for me. Earlier this year, 1953,

54:53.400 --> 55:01.240
I sold 89% in one of these wells for $1.75 million, end quote, testified oil Tejon field

55:01.240 --> 55:07.080
ranch owner Horace Steele, quote, I drilled two wells on my own initiative after Mr. Gabauer told

55:07.080 --> 55:12.760
me not to. On the basis of surveys taken by his machine, both of these wells turned out dry.

55:12.760 --> 55:19.320
I paid Gabauer $10,000 for the complete survey. It was worth every penny, end quote. Mind you,

55:19.320 --> 55:24.680
according to court records, JP Kahn was on the sideline assisting every step of the way with

55:24.680 --> 55:32.120
the prosecution of Gabauer and Newton. In a rather bizarre twist on 18 December 1953, prosecution

55:32.120 --> 55:38.280
called Thor Severson, a Denver Post reporter. Severson had attended Newton's March 1953

55:38.280 --> 55:44.040
university lecture on flying saucers. According to court records, Severson showed a now famous

55:44.040 --> 55:49.880
photograph displaying Scully, Newton, and George Kohler and claimed without evidence this meeting

55:49.880 --> 55:56.520
conspiratorially discussed oil detecting devices. The confusing trial of Newton and Gabauer eventually

55:56.600 --> 56:03.000
came to an end. The two were found guilty of fraud and faced up to 30 years in prison, but

56:03.000 --> 56:09.960
the case evaporated. The men were never sentenced and faced no fines. Curiously, Newton agreed to

56:09.960 --> 56:17.800
pay a sum of $18,000 to cover court costs, as though this was a civil case, not criminal prosecution.

56:18.360 --> 56:24.120
But the damage was done. The Aztec story was officially dead and buried. Kahn's conquest

56:24.120 --> 56:29.000
of vengeance had been successful. Even though upon his passing, manager of Kahn's estate,

56:29.000 --> 56:34.200
Robert McClay, produced cover art for Kahn's attempts to push more flying saucer stories in

56:34.200 --> 56:41.400
the 1960s. With the facts of this case, one must ask why were Newton and Gabauer even charged?

56:41.400 --> 56:46.760
Scott and Suzanne Ramsey argue this court case was punishment to Newton for introducing Dr.

56:46.760 --> 56:53.080
G to Scully, wasting Newton's time delivering him stress and draining him of tremendous amounts of

56:53.080 --> 56:59.000
money. Closer to modern day, many who disclose information on UFO crash retrievals or alien

56:59.000 --> 57:04.680
reproduction vehicles face similar reprisals. These include Jonathan Weigant and Mark McCandelish,

57:04.680 --> 57:09.000
both of whom were craftily targeted by the IRS after their disclosures.

57:09.640 --> 57:15.240
Now after that entire long-winded court case section, and before we move on, we must discuss a

57:15.240 --> 57:21.960
never-finished autobiography dated 1954 written by Newton and found within the Scully archive by

57:22.040 --> 57:28.600
Scott and Suzanne Ramsey. Quickly, let's recap what we know about Newton. Newton was born 19 July

57:28.600 --> 57:34.600
1897 and earned a bachelor degree at Baylor, studied at Yale, and performed postgraduate work

57:34.600 --> 57:39.560
at the University of Berlin. Newton became a successful oil entrepreneur because of his

57:39.560 --> 57:45.320
background as a geophysicist who studied petroleum under the earth. The oil man's relationships

57:45.320 --> 57:50.920
would lead him to connect with Leo Gabauer and Dr. G, where Newton both likely heard about the Aztec

57:50.920 --> 57:57.400
crash and prototype oil-fighting devices. Newton would disclose data of the crash alongside Dr. G

57:57.400 --> 58:03.160
to Frank Scully and even take the place of a lecturer at the University of Denver in 1950.

58:03.160 --> 58:09.000
Newton is also a convicted, but never sentenced con man, and as we discussed, there is more than

58:09.000 --> 58:14.680
meet the eye to his court case. But what did Newton have to write about himself? Within the

58:14.680 --> 58:19.800
manuscript, Newton wrote openly about his friendship with Gabauer and did in fact have a business

58:19.800 --> 58:25.240
deal that went south with Denver businessman Herman Flater. Newton saw his University of Denver

58:25.240 --> 58:31.080
lecture as the focal point of his entire story. Indeed, the manuscript shows Newton had a deep

58:31.080 --> 58:36.200
fascination of magnetics and displayed both an admirable effort to understand the history of

58:36.200 --> 58:42.920
magnetism as well as strong conviction flying saucers did indeed operate off of magnetic principles.

58:42.920 --> 58:47.960
Again, Newton recounted how he originally was not supposed to speak at this lecture.

58:47.960 --> 58:53.800
One of the quote-unquote men of science, likely comprising Dr. G, was to be the lecturer.

58:53.800 --> 58:59.880
quote, some four years ago, I dared to stand before an audience in a so-called hall of learning

58:59.880 --> 59:04.360
and tell a packed body of students a story I had heard about a phenomenon on which

59:04.360 --> 59:09.480
are guardians of space. The Air Force, together with the Air Force of Canada and Great Britain

59:09.480 --> 59:15.400
and other nations, have spent millions trying to identify what they term unidentified aerial

59:15.400 --> 59:21.080
objects. They also call it quote-unquote project blue book to give it a proper cloak of mystery

59:21.080 --> 59:26.600
here in the USA, end quote. Newton defiantly stated regarding the lecture quote,

59:26.600 --> 59:31.960
as to my talk, it wasn't long before the finger of prosecution began pointing my way

59:31.960 --> 59:36.520
and they've scorched my hide already, but I haven't recanted, end quote.

59:36.520 --> 59:42.520
And while on the subject, a quick note here is well worth referencing. In the 1970s, UFO

59:42.520 --> 59:48.840
investigator and former CIA officer Carl Flock claimed to have obtained a diary kept by Silas Newton.

59:49.800 --> 59:54.280
This diary allegedly discussed Newton revealing that in the early 1950s,

59:54.280 --> 59:59.480
he was contacted by US military officials who wished to speak to him about Aztec.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:05.240
Newton was told the military knew the Aztec story to be bogus. However, they still wished him to

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:11.320
spread the story far and wide to whoever would listen. Flock never produced this diary and after

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:17.000
unrelenting pursuit by Scott Ramsey, admitted his source for this diary was Newton's nephew.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.320
Now, Newton's sons were both still alive at this time, so one might ask why Newton's nephew would

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:29.240
be in possession of the diary. But nevertheless, Flock never produced material evidence of these

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:35.080
statements. But back to Newton's manuscript, Silas recalled his tarring and feathering with a

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.920
rather melancholic tone, writing quote, when the day comes and one of the silent invaders of our

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.600
skies sets down and we are greeted by the people of another planet. I'm wondering if they too will

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.120
be stoned in the marketplace. Me thinks they already know our ways and ere they do visit us,

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.760
they'll be in a position to protect themselves against our gangster methods and our shoot first

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:02.280
and investigate afterwards system, end quote. In the manuscript, Newton would discuss how

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:08.280
Canadian radio engineer Wilbur B Smith had his complete and unwavering admiration for studying

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.760
saucer magnetic propulsion. And this revelation is enormous and we will soon relate it to Sarbacher.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:20.600
Newton's fascination with magnetics makes perfect sense when we piece together that likely before

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.840
World War Two, Newton knew select oil and gas scientists who went into top secret work for

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:33.160
Vannevar Bush during World War Two. These scientists, as we will discuss soon, would have been an

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:40.520
ideal team to study downed UFO saucers found during 1947 to 1950 and Newton would have

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:46.200
likely stayed in touch with them to assist in the development of magnetic anomaly detection devices

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:52.760
or MADS that were then and still are called doodle bugs and possibly receive first hand

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:59.400
information on UFO crash retrievals along the way. Indeed, according to the Aztec UFO incident,

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:05.160
a separate 1950 wire recording archived at the University of Washington saw Newton speak of

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:11.800
doing magnetic research in the Mojave Desert with a top magnetic scientist in 1949. In this

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.080
recording, Newton recalled mentioning reading about flying saucers to the scientist, to which

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.120
the scientist retorted that he had driven from Denver to Phoenix and when he drove past New

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.400
Mexico, he thought he wished Silas Newton was there so he could show Newton where the saucer

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.160
had landed. According to Newton, the scientist recalled the Rocky Plateau northeast of Aztec

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.480
and how they, the scientists in the military, had arrived from Durango, Colorado. Miraculously,

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:45.240
I do believe I have found this exact wire, or one similar recorded three March 1950,

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:51.240
so let's listen to Silas himself. In the summer of 1949, while engaged in

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.480
magnetic research in the Mojave Desert in California,

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:06.360
I was driving one day with one of my associates who happens to be rated the top

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:13.800
magnetic scientist of the United States. In conversation with this gentleman,

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:26.680
I had occasion to mention a report about flying saucers. I said,

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:33.720
Dr, do you happen to know anything about them? His answer was starting. He said to me,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.800
he said, I thought about you last week when I came down from Denver to Phoenix.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:49.000
When I passed Aztec, New Mexico, I said to my wife, I wish Silas was here,

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.240
because I would take him out and show him where the first flying saucer landed

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:03.400
in the United States. I said, Dr, do you mean to tell me that one of these ships landed

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.320
and that the American people don't know anything about it?

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:23.160
He said, two telescopes saw this flying saucer or an unidentified ship, and

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:33.640
they watched its position on the telescope and estimated approximately where it would land.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:48.680
Within two to three hours after the landing, our force officials reached the flying field

01:04:48.680 --> 01:05:02.040
at Durango and took off in their search for this object. When they found it, it was in a

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:10.680
very rocky, high plateau territory about 16 miles east of Aztec, New Mexico.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:24.200
They immediately threw a guard around it, and about seven of our magnetic group of scientists

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:35.080
were called in to examine this strange ship. Now, before we move on, I leave you with this

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.080
powerful quote on page 228 from Newton's manuscript.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:11.000
I have, however, not only been libeled and lied about, but I have been pictured as the deliberate

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.680
author of the whole idea. And to follow it up, the same people who defamed me in print

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.360
then framed up a prosecution that even at this hour seems to me like some horrible nightmare

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:33.960
from which I will awaken in time. The Ramses and myself share the sentiment the trial of Newton

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:40.760
was targeted retaliation for leaking information about the Aztec case. William Steinman presents

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.800
a far more dramatic and consequential reason for the court case of Newton and Gebauer. These

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.840
conclusions will also lead us to discuss in depth the doodle bug, which may just be the

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:58.120
linchpin of the whole case, tying in together Aztec, Mr. G, Newton, Scholle, Gebauer, and possibly

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.560
the Majestic Twelve. Recall how Steinman's investigation and sources led him to conclude

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:10.200
Dr. Carl A. Highland was not only one of the real Mr. G's, but also an MJ-12 member and

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:16.440
first-hand participant of the Aztec UFO crash. Dr. Carl Highland owned the Highland Research

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:21.880
and Exploration Company based in Denver, Colorado. Steinman claims Highland's business was quite

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:27.080
familiar with devices used for detecting oil wells and water, and that Gebauer had even

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:32.600
consulted with Highland's company. Steinman's theory goes Highland and Gebauer sought ways to

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.200
test modified and developed magnetic aerial detection equipment from World War II, anti-summering

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.160
programs, and thus the two engaged with oil man Silas Newton. In fact, Steinman argued Highland

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:51.400
and Gebauer were not only acquaintances, but also research compatriots. In his book, Steinman and

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:58.280
Furs, Gebauer, and Highland worked and lived together in 1935 in Antarctica for a US government

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.400
research project. According to the researcher, the two would later be involved with top secret

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:08.840
development of magnetic aerial detection, anti-summering technology, and then post-war,

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:15.240
adapt such technology back to underground oil, gas, water, and or other detection.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.120
I should, however, note that Steinman does not offer exhibits of evidence or context around

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:25.000
these statements, so while I have no reason to doubt him here, we still cannot prove Highland

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.120
and Gebauer 100% worked and lived alongside one another. Furthermore, Steinman would also claim

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.560
Gebauer worked at the Phoenix and Los Angeles Division of Air Research Company. Recall how

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:43.160
Air Research Company and its founder, Dr. Paul Sherer, a colleague of Vannevar Bush and member

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.640
of the Research and Development Board, was allegedly called to action to provide freezing

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.720
equipment to preserve the Aztec bodies. Another interesting connection that I find

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.200
little to back up, however, it should be mentioned the Ramses additionally stated

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.800
Gebauer had served high positions within the Air Research Laboratories around 1946,

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.560
according to Better Business Bureau records. But back to Highland, Highland was involved in

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:15.160
early uses of the magnetometer for both geophysical exploration purposes and for detecting

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.400
submarines during World War II. Steinman argued Highland was the initial source of the Aztec leak,

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:27.320
disclosing information, photographs, materials, etc. to Newton and Gebauer.

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.680
When the Majestic 12 or whatever UFO legacy program entity was controlling dissemination

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:38.760
of information around this time found out, Highland was forced to withdraw from the March 1950

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.720
University of Denver lecture where scientist X, Silas Newton, took his place.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.480
Highland explained to his visitor that he could not do so with a clear conscience

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.680
and look Gebauer in the eye knowing that they had both developed these devices together.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.880
This ultimately, according to the theory, led to Dr. James Meredith, a co-worker of Highland at

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:32.840
the Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Department, to testify against Gebauer with fraudulent devices.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:38.200
Recall how Steinman connected the doodle bug with World War II submarine detecting equipment.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.240
This is where our story gets incredibly strange and perhaps there is more to the

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:49.080
inappropriately named doodle bug than meets the eye. Remember, several witnesses testified in

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:54.360
support of Gebauer and Newton that their device was indeed successful at finding oil or water

01:10:54.360 --> 01:11:00.120
deposits. Gebauer's device, if real, may have been an early iteration of a magnetic anomaly

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.640
detection device or MAD and this device, like Steinman proposed, could have connected Gebauer

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.720
and Newton to the Aztec saucer. Newton and Gebauer, as stated in Newton's never-finished autobiography,

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.840
were familiar with scientists before the Second World War who were working on finding oil-finding

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.440
devices that transitioned to work under Vannevar Bush for secretive submarine detection missions

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:28.120
in both theaters of World War II. After all, according to Scully, the Dr. G scientists were

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:33.400
quote unquote top shelf and worked on secretive projects during the Second World War. Scully

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.920
additionally labeled some of the Dr. Gs as working out the means by which Japanese submarines were

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:45.320
detected by magnetic devices. So let's really pull on this thread here. In 1930, a company was

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:53.400
founded by Dr. J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott called Geophysical Services Inc. quote,

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:59.320
Karcher was an American geophysicist and businessman who invented the reflection Seismograph applying

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:05.240
for patents in 1919. He eventually commercialized the process by which most of the world's oil

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.480
reserves were discovered. McDermott was a geophysicist and pioneer of providing seismic services to the

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:18.680
petroleum industry. The original GSI was founded in 1930 to offer the first ever reflection Seismograph

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:25.480
exploration services to the oil industry, end quote. In 1917, when John Karcher revealed his

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.000
formula for calculating the depth of subsurface formations, he knew he had developed something

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.800
very important. His discovery led to a plan for someday using seismic waves to map structures

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:44.360
far below the earth's surface. The oil producing world would come to know the reflection Seismograph

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.800
as the instrument which fulfilled that plan. I do not think it is any stretch here to assume

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:56.520
GSI sought prolific and successful oil men in the American Southwest like Silas Newton to test

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:02.760
their groundbreaking products. By 1939, the founders of GSI started another company which

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:09.320
acted as GSI's parent company called the Colorado Corporation. The purpose here was to keep GSI in

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:15.080
the reflection Seismograph business exploring oil and gas whilst the Colorado Corps could continue

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:22.840
to branch into new ventures. By 1941, Eugene McDermott along with several key employees purchased GSI

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.760
from Colorado Corp. Immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor, GSI and the reflection

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:34.120
seismograph technologies were recruited to secretive projects for anti-summarine warfare.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.120
The National Defense Research Council was setting up the organizations through which university

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:46.280
and industry people were to be pulled together to tackle specific jobs in technology and design

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:54.600
for the war effort. GSI had a hidden asset, its long experience in building sophisticated

01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.920
electronic equipment for its own use. This experience and Johnson's frequent trips to

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.560
Washington led to some engineering and development tasks for the Army Signal Corps

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:10.440
and a contract for airborne magnetic submarine detectors for the Navy.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:17.880
By 1942, GSI had become a DOD contractor in Navy war production engineering, specifically focused

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.640
on using their technology for submarine detection. GSI was recruited by the Office of Scientific

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.680
Research and Development, an office set up by the US government during World War II to quote,

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:34.600
engage the brightest scientific minds and the great machinery of industry in the pursuit of victory

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:42.360
and quote, the head of this OSRD was of course accused MJ1 and lead scientist for the Aztec crash,

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:49.560
Dr. Vannevar Bush. Working under Vannevar Bush, the OSRD and Navy War Department, GSI was divided

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:55.240
into four groups, the Laboratory Manufacturing Division, Apparatus Division, Equipment Group,

01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:01.880
and Defense Systems and Electronics Group, aka DSEG. So hold on here and let's get this straight.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:08.520
GSI was developing oil detecting devices used possibly by Silas M. Newton before being recruited

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:14.680
in World War II by Dr. Vannevar Bush and the OSRD in order to adapt their technology for

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:21.320
anti-submarine programs. This ties in perfectly to the statements made by Steinman and Scully

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:28.920
in their publishing. But that's not all here and far from it. GSI would later on in 1951 become

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.920
Texas Instruments, a contractor accused of housing UFO legacy program operations.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:41.720
It is comical to me how Texas Instruments themselves refer to legendary GSI geophysicists,

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:48.440
geologists, engineers, scientists, and others who performed seismic survey tasks as doodlebuggers.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.760
But as GSI sounds like a perfect corporation that fits the description of the workplace of one,

01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:00.840
if not multiple Mr. G's, are there any former GSI employees that really fit our conditions?

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:08.120
One possible source of Dr. G was GSI co-founder Eugene McDermott. McDermott was a luminary and

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:14.040
genius, himself registering five of the early GSI patents that greatly earned the respect of

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.360
Vannevar Bush. If Bush did indeed spearhead the Aztec retrieval, a trusted and respected genius

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:25.800
like McDermott would make an obvious candidate for a scientist on the team. McDermott was active

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:32.840
with GSI since its inception in the 1930s, when GSI was largely working with oil and gas detection,

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.960
possibly working in allowing Newton and Gebauer to test their technologies.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.000
McDermott was revered by his employees, such as Cecil Green, who would go on to serve as

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.520
president and chairman when GSI became Texas Instruments. In a comical statement relevant

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.760
to the subject of UFOs, according to Green, McDermott had extreme skills in reverse engineering

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:01.560
almost anything he was given. The co-founder of GSI, J. Clarence Karcher, makes an additional

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:08.200
possibility for a Mr. G, as he originally applied for patents in reflection seismology in 1921.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:13.880
According to an engraved monument, quote, proved the validity of the reflection seismograph as a

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.880
useful tool in the search for oil, end quote. While not directly an employee of GSI, we have

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:25.400
already discussed Carl Highland and how he possibly leaked the Aztec story to his compatriot,

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:33.000
Leo Gebauer. Additionally, outside, but possibly tangential to GSI, we have two Mr. Gs of interest,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.440
Otto German Arnold Schmidt and John Tarrant's Tate. Schmidt was an accomplished expert of

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:44.360
biophysics, bioengineering, electrical engineering, and magnetism. In 1937, Schmidt

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:49.560
even performed research at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, which I have previously

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:55.720
connected to undersea UFO crash retrievals. By March 1941, Schmidt was appointed by Dr.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:02.200
Vannevar Bush as the official investigator for the National Defense Research Committee, or NDRC.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:08.760
Shortly after, the NDRC evolved into Bush's famous OSRD, or the Office of Scientific Research

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:15.400
and Development. As we discussed with GSI, the role of OSRD in World War II was clearly defined,

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:21.800
a hard military focus helmed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. Schmidt would join John Tarrant's Tate

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:28.200
retrofitting PBY Catalina amphibious bombers with magnetic detecting equipment known as MAD,

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.720
Magnetic Anomaly Detector, later referred to as Magnetic Airborne Detector Device.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:39.480
As we mentioned earlier, Gubauer's device could have possibly existed as early iterations of the

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:45.720
Magnetic Anomaly Detector. However, conclusions drawn by the fantastic research of the Ramses

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.320
point specifically to John Tarrant's Tate as a likely Mr. G, quote,

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.360
he had more degrees than a thermometer and had received them from such diverse institutions

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.800
as the Armour Institute, Creighton University, and the University of Berlin, he is the scientist

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:09.000
I have called Dr. G, end quote. Frank Scully when discussing one of the scientists known as Dr. G,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.360
Tate earned his master's degree in physics and electrical engineering at the University of Omaha,

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:21.240
nestled in Nebraska alongside Creighton University, and earned his doctorate at the University of Berlin.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:27.400
During World War I, quote, Tate and his colleagues verified the existence of discrete energy levels

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.800
and showed that there was a difference in the amount of energy required to spur radiation

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.880
and the amount of energy that is needed for ionization. This helped connect

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.600
Bohr's theory and those of Heisenberg and Schrödinger in quantum mechanics, end quote.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:46.280
During the Second World War, Tate was recruited by Vannevar Bush to work for anti-summering

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:51.880
programs with the NDRC, which would later on become the OSRD. Tate would enjoy prestigious

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:57.480
positions during the war, including scientific advisor for the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet,

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:03.080
Assistant Chief of the Office of Field Services of OSRD, and the Director of Operations, Research,

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.040
and Chief Member of the Rocket Ordnance Division and National Defense Research Committee.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:14.040
In July of 2011, Scott and Suzanne Ramsey traveled to the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:19.160
to study archival material on Tate's life and work. Here they found evidence Tate had

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:25.080
actually traveled to the Southwest at the time of Aztec. Quote, in front of a large audience,

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:30.280
Tate stated that during a recent trip, he had experienced something that had changed his life.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:36.120
According to him, what he had seen could change the way that energy is generated,

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.560
how food is produced, and overall how humanity could be served. This was a complete reversal

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:47.800
of his normal retiring attitude, end quote. From Highland to Tate and Dr. G's relation to Newton

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:53.640
and Gebauer, this chapter has served to attempt to unveil at least some of the nebulous Dr. G,

01:20:53.640 --> 01:21:00.680
and also demonstrate Gebauer's doodle bug was not a fanciful object bought for $4.45 at a surplus

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:06.360
store, but instead based on real technology from real scientists, many of whom were connected with

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.400
geophysical services Inc. that would bridge the technology for submarine detection equipment

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.480
in World War II and foster close relationships with Vannevar Bush.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:26.440
Thus far, we have discussed the Aztec crash, according to our primary sources,

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.000
outlined at the start of this project. I do want to spend a little bit of time

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.160
narrowing in on some of the work Steinman did in his 1986 epic UFO crash at Aztec,

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:43.240
a well kept secret. This enormous book only saw 1,000 copies printed, and as I stated at

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.760
the beginning of this project, I have purchased a copy for high quality scans for this video.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:55.560
In his book, Steinman revolutionized the Aztec case by mentioning the IPU, MJ-12, and actually

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:00.520
identifying the team of scientists he claimed were present for the crash recovery, including

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:07.160
Vannevar Bush, Von Neumann, Highland, etc. Now, as much as I love this book and want to praise it,

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.680
Steinman remained throughout the book, somewhat cagey about his sources and origins of information.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:18.040
Examples include definitive mention Leo Gebauer and Highland worked alongside one another without

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:23.640
evidence, an involvement of the IPU without firmly stating his sourcing or rationale.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:28.840
So, as we have been doing, we must try and draw our own parallels and conclusions based upon the

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:34.360
research presented. Steinman became intrigued with behind the flying saucers after he once

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:40.040
read about the Aztec case in Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.840
The researcher wrote his epic based upon the foundation the Aztec crash was true,

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.160
but started back at square one to derive his own sources and methods.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:53.960
Viewers of my channel know I reference often and hold a great deal of respect for Steinman,

01:22:53.960 --> 01:23:00.280
a true researcher who admirably cold-contacted many figures associated with UFO legacy programs

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:06.200
and crash retrievals. The case portrayed by Steinman is remarkably similar to the case discussed by

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:11.400
Scully, Newton, and several Aztec witnesses completely disconnected from the original

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:17.480
Aztec reporting crew. So, no, Sean Kirkpatrick, there is no circular reporting here.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:23.160
The major difference in Steinman's reporting is how access was gained to the craft. Thus far,

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:28.280
we have heard different testimony of oil field workers to the recovery team exploiting an existing

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:33.240
hole in one of the craft's portholes to open a doorway in the vehicle. Steinman's account

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:38.680
states one of the accredited scientists on site observed a knob-shaped protrusion with a button

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:44.440
in the middle through one of the craft portholes. The unnamed scientist thus ordered for the team

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.800
to pick up hammers and beat the porthole glass out. Then we return to what we have heard already,

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:54.360
where the team used a long pole to poke around in the craft and eventually open it.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:59.240
Intriguing to me in this passage here is Steinman's reporting Bush's team attempted

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:04.280
myriad solutions to disassemble the enormous craft for removal, cutting torches,

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.160
diamond drills, diamond cutting saws, and more. But no device would face the metal,

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.920
let alone penetrate the material.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:17.400
Quote, finally, one scientist after a very thorough examination found a place on the inside

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.680
where there was some sort of interlocking key device. When he pulled on the device,

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.840
a seam opened up on the ship at that particular location from top to bottom.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.920
He continued around the ship and found several of these devices at equally spaced intervals.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.000
Here was the key to disassembly problem that they had been looking for, end quote.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.600
Again, I am strongly reminded of the words of director of naval intelligence and BDM

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:48.360
board member Sumner Shapiro. In his work, Steinman professed to contain knowledge of personnel,

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.920
brought in to study the craft over a year after its recovery. But unfortunately,

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.720
he did not detail where and how he obtained this data, but it is, nevertheless,

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.080
worth our time to study. Steinman stated, a little over a year and a half after the recovery,

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:09.160
November of 1949 to be exact, Dr. Eric Henry Wayne was called onto the project.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.960
Now, does this name sound familiar to anyone?

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.000
Wayne worked as a consultant to the Wright Air Development Center on Aerodynamic

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.800
Metallurgical Design for the Structure Division and served on the staff for the University of

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:27.960
Cincinnati. Wayne was also one of the key scientific figures mentioned along the 1953

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:33.720
Kingman, Arizona crash retrieval. I previously made a video on Kingman, one of my all-time favorite

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:39.720
crash retrieval events, and of course, Wayne was mentioned. You know, David gave them first-hand

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:46.600
direct information from his sources of where to look, where to find the spacecraft, where to

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.520
literally go and open the door. Oh, by the way, there's a spacecraft recovered from Aztec. Open

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.640
this door, oh yeah, that's the one from Kingman. If Wayne really was involved with Aztec, perhaps

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.840
his efforts to understand the craft were indeed successful. Seen as during Kingman, while spearheading

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:07.800
the Office of Special Studies at Wright-Patterson Airfield, Wayne was suspected of leading the

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:14.040
reverse engineering team on the crashed non-human craft. As I said in my Kingman video, which still

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:20.440
holds true, Wayne has proved exceedingly difficult to track down, almost as if he was erased from

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:26.040
public record. All I can prove with Wayne is that he was indeed the head of the Office of Special

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.000
Studies at Wright-Patt and involved with Operation Upshot Knot-Hole. The nuclear test

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.480
thought to have been the impetus of the Kingman's craft's crash. All the way back in 1986, Steinman

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:43.000
understandably found difficulty digging up info on Wayne, thus believing the Majestic 12

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.600
wished to keep their prize scientist off public record. Steinman was able to wrangle up tiny

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:54.920
references to Wayne, his obituary for example, in the April 1961 edition of Mechanical Engineering

01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:00.520
Magazine. The obituary shed more light on this enigmatic figure possibly connected to

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.040
Aztec and Kingman. Wayne hailed from Austria and after earning his degrees in teaching in Cincinnati,

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:12.120
Ohio, Wayne began work on secret government projects in 1949 at Wright Development Center.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:18.280
In 1956, Wayne's department was moved to Sandia Laboratory Complex at Kirtland Air Force Base,

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.720
where he remained until his death. Remember, Sandia and Kirtland are two of the most critical

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:29.960
names in my research on UFO legacy program operation locations. Admirably, Steinman

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.480
contacted an individual in Albuquerque who knew Wayne very well. The individual was mentioned

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.880
only by the name MW. MW stated Wayne's personal papers were all confiscated by military

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.520
intelligence upon his death, placed behind lock and key of a highly secretive section

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.560
of the library at Kirtland Air Force Base. Wishing to discuss saucers off a line that

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:57.160
was likely being tampered with, Steinman and MW planned to exchange letters. Steinman never

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.360
heard back from MW, but did notice his mail being tampered with and a tracking device stuck to his

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:08.840
van. Unfortunately, the enigma that is Dr. Eric Wang persists today. Who was Wang? Was he called

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.040
in to assist with the Aztec crash in regards to study and duplication, and did he spearhead the

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.440
1953 Kingman crash recovery?

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:27.160
Historically, the Aztec case has rested solely on the credibility of Silas Newton. Since he

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.640
is a convicted conman, though the story is not that simple, the whole case has been labeled

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.480
by publications such as the ever-reliable Wikipedia as a hoax. But are there eyewitnesses

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:43.080
to the crash? Are there individuals who saw the disc, touched the disc, or perhaps participated

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:48.200
in the retrieval first hand? Well, thanks to the tireless work of Steinman and the Ramses,

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.600
yes indeed, we do. And let's briefly explore a few here.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:59.000
Valentin Archuleta initially disclosed his testimony to William Steinman in 1982 under the pseudonym

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.520
VA. Archuleta served in World War II and was deployed to the harrowing eastern theater in the

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:11.320
Philippines. Archuleta was captured, but miraculously survived the horrific Japanese POW camps.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.400
After the war, Archuleta served as a rancher in Aztec, New Mexico.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:22.360
Valentin claimed early one morning between 1948 to 1950, he was outperforming his usual chores.

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.360
The rancher heard a large explosion. Looking in the direction of the sound,

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:32.040
Archuleta observed a huge disc-shaped craft, larger than his house, with a dome on top,

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:37.880
passed within 200 yards of him overhead. This disc appeared to be in trouble, skimming as low as

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.280
100 feet over the ground and wobbled as it careened overhead.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:47.240
Valentin described the disc striking the corner of a 150-foot cliff face,

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.800
shooting sparks and rocks in every direction. The Ramses have sought and believed to have

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.200
found this location. Archuleta proceeded to call the military in Albuquerque,

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:02.040
aka Kirtland Air Force Base, a base I have on myriad occasions associated with UFO crash

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:07.480
retrieval operations. Valentin requested the Air Force call him back to explain what was happening,

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:14.760
but was never contacted again. Now, paramount to the whole Aztec story is, of course, oil. Recall,

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.360
all the way back to the beginning of this video when we described the event,

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:25.160
oil workers were some of the first civilians on scene. In 1948, 19-year-old Doug Nolan worked

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:30.680
for the El Paso Oil Company. Early one morning, Nolan was on his way to pick up his supervisor

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:35.880
Bill Ferguson to proceed to a grueling day of work in the oil field south of Aztec.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.880
Bill and form Doug, a brush fire, had started on Hart Canyon Road,

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:45.480
12 miles northeast of Aztec. Since this fire was supposedly burning near some of the company's

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.920
oil drip tanks, the two dispatched towards the area. Arriving to the tanks, Bill and Doug were

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:56.440
greeted by several other oil workers already on scene to investigate. The two were told something

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:03.320
strange was sitting atop the hill. Quote, the craft was extremely large. We realized the craft

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:09.960
was smooth with no noticeable seams, rivets, bolts, or weld marks. It looked as if it was molded.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:15.400
The craft was brushed aluminum, looking to be very smooth, but not highly polished aluminum,

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:20.360
like you would see on an airplane, end quote. Doug and the other men climbed atop the craft,

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:25.880
resting at an angle on the mesa, looking for some sort of entry point. The men found a small

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:31.880
porthole type feature atop the dome, quote, the windows or portholes looked like mirrors until

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:37.400
you would get closer, then you could see right through them, end quote. Just as the Aztec story

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:43.320
goes, Doug stated one porthole featured a hole no bigger than the size of a quarter. Inside the craft,

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:48.840
Doug would claim to see two bodies, quote, slumped over what appeared to be a control panel of sorts,

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:54.200
end quote. Quote, by the time the local law enforcement showed up, Bill, who was ignoring

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:58.920
the orders to stay away from the craft, was trying to poke around the craft with a firepull or

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:05.240
something he pulled off one of the trucks. Soon, he hit something, and a door or walkway appeared.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:10.600
Some of us had to look inside and see what else was in there, and if anyone was in need of help,

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:16.520
end quote. The small bodies inside were charred a dark brown, likely burned to a crisp,

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:22.040
but the craft's interior was undamaged. Doug described the disc as 100 feet across,

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:28.200
describing the craft as having a very thin cross section, only 18 to 20 feet high and very thin

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:33.800
at the edges. Doug did describe some strange markings on the outer edge of the craft.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:39.640
Gold color rings, three if I remember correctly, that ran around the entire outer edge of the disc,

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:44.600
end quote. Quite a number of locals began to arrive to the scene, according to Nolan,

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:50.840
including cattle ranchers Mr. and Mrs. Knight, who warned the oil workers to get away from the disc.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:55.640
Doug's testimony recounts the circling of a helicopter overhead, which stood out to him

01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:02.120
almost as bizarrely as the disc. A law enforcement officer, now identified as Manuel Sandoval from

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:07.480
the nearby Cuba, New Mexico, arrived on scene, claiming he had followed the low-flying disc

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:13.320
in a northerly direction. Similar to Archuleta, Sandoval described seeing the craft as wobbly

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:19.400
and fluttering like a leaf. The policeman quickly took initiative, ordering locals off the craft.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:24.600
More men, including a local officer, pulled to the scene, who informed Sandoval the military

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.320
was well aware of the craft and that everybody should leave the area at once.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:35.160
The military eventually showed up, in Doug's words, in a very big way. Doug was impressed with

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:40.600
how fast the uniformed men showed to scene. He was unaware if the men were USAF or ARMY,

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.560
as the two were recently separated, but their vehicles did, according to Doug, look ARMY.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:51.640
Now, these men were not young guys, according to Doug's eyes. They appeared seasoned,

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:56.920
assertive, and well-trained, possibly IPU, if Steinman's theories are correct.

01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.400
The military on scene quickly assembled everyone present and divided the people for

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:06.280
interview. The uniformed men told Doug and presumably others, quote,

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.720
This event was extremely important to the United States, that we were responsible for our national

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.360
security and that we will never talk to anyone about this event, end quote.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.000
Other eyewitnesses described almost identical crash sites to Scott Ramsay.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.680
These include Ken Farley, who while on his deathbed in 1999, disclosed to Ramsay,

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:32.360
Farley was visiting his aunt in Durango, Colorado, north of Aztec, and was on his way to Cedar Hill,

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:38.920
New Mexico, to see a friend the early morning of 25 March 1948. After his friend suggested they

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:44.600
check out a lot of activity on a nearby dirt road, the two drove to Hart Canyon Road.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:49.640
Following the dust and dirt clouds from other cars, the two men got out and walked on top of the

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:56.040
mesa. The two men saw a huge object with people ranging from oil field workers to an older couple,

01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:02.200
possibly the knights walking around the craft, quote. We saw a large disc shaped object,

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:07.800
aluminum in color, but not really very shiny, sort of dull aluminum. I could not see any

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:13.640
structures as far as doors or windows. The entire craft was very smooth. The craft did not appear

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:19.320
to have any damage, but lay on the mesa at a funny angle and sort of rested on its belly.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.320
The disc had a bubble or protrusion on the bottom from what I can remember,

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:29.640
and also one on the top. It sort of reminded me of two pie pans with a bubble for a top and bottom.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.640
The top bubble was larger than the bottom. The craft was lying at an angle, maybe 12 degrees or so,

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:41.880
end quote. Ken described the scene, two police officers on site, likely Sandoval and the local

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:47.480
officer, were asking folks to leave. Oil field workers were climbing all over the craft and

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:53.240
an old couple, again the knights, yelled at the men to get off. Shortly after, according to Ken,

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:59.560
disgruntled military personnel arrived whisking people off site. In a truly incredible turn of

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:06.280
events, the Ramses have located two Aztec witnesses on the side of the recovery efforts.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.720
In 2001, Scott Ramsey interviewed a USAF veteran by the pseudonym George.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.880
Ramsey states the identity of George was known by multiple researchers,

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.440
including the legendary Stanton Freedman. George claimed to be stationed as an airman

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:27.000
of the Walker Air Force Base in 1948. Formerly known as the infamous Roswell Army Airfield,

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.960
George claimed the Aztec retrieval was indeed coordinated out of Walker AFB.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:37.880
Perfectly suited after Roswell Army Airfield had garnered experience retrieving non-human craft

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.400
solely eight months prior. George explained to Scott Ramsey the retrieval operation was

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.920
highly compartmentalized, with information restricted to a need-to-know basis concerning

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.200
the work to which each individual was assigned, similar to the Manhattan Project. George's

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.680
directive was to keep personnel records for everyone who was working the recovery.

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:09.720
Though he was not in the loop on everything, far from it in fact,

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:15.400
George claimed to see daily intelligence reports concerning progress made and people involved.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.000
George stated the retrieval process took every part of two weeks.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:57.560
Now, of course, if you've been paying attention, there is an issue here. If Dr.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:02.920
Carl Highland was indeed present at Aztec, George failed his duties as the Ramses were able to

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:08.520
place Highland in the American Southwest at the time of Aztec. George recalled the Air Force based

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:14.200
out of Walker Air Force Base and Army Fifth Base out of Colorado as well as a few other select

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:20.200
basers or locations were involved in the crash. And recall how Steinman stated the U.S. Army

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.480
Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit arrived to the Aztec crash from Camp Hale, Colorado.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:31.400
And while we're here, let's reference back to the U.S. Army CID slash FBI Sting Operation

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:38.360
conducted in 1950 to purchase Aztec crash photographs. Far removed from Newton, Scully,

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:44.360
or any of the main characters of the Aztec case, official memorandums discussing the Sting referenced

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:49.480
the Fifth Army Intelligence Division Regional Office being involved in receiving information

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.760
and interviewing witnesses surrounding the Sting. George claimed the personnel involved in the

01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:00.280
recovery were highly trained and seasoned, similar to the IPU claims of Steinman and

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:17.480
eyewitness testimony of Doug Nolan. We can take this away from George's testimony.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:23.160
The issues with the Roswell recovery led to Aztec featuring new people and new procedures,

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.040
and though George was not privy to policy, the Aztec proceedings were handled by highly

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.640
trained professionals. He had no direct knowledge, but George wagered the craft was taken to Los

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.680
Alamos. After the event, George noticed a tremendous amount of equipment at the then

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:45.240
Atomic Energy Commission lab, including flatbed and low-boy trucks. Interesting here, George also

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:50.680
claimed to see photos of the craft. As of course did Scully's wife, and as we know, elements of

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:57.640
the U.S. DOD and IC were interested in intercepting such images. Possibly paramount to our entire

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.840
investigation, Ramsay asked George if the Air Force was upset with Scully, who wrote the

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:15.480
first book on Aztec, and a bestseller at that. If George's account is true, this tremendously

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.520
strengthens the argument Newton and Gabbower were put through grueling trial as punishment for

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:31.560
leaking the story. Tangential to our story today, but just as Aztec was born from Scully's behind

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.560
the flying saucers, so too did the book give rise to the testimony of one of the most critically

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:45.240
overlooked characters in all of UFO lore, Dr. Robert Sarbacher. In 1950, Canadian government

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.200
senior radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith wrote to the Controller of Telecommunications

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.640
in the Department of Transport requesting for Canada to begin its first official investigation

01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:03.320
into UFOs, specifically studying complex magnetism as a form of propulsion. This document was never

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.920
supposed to be public. The classification of this document was likely accidentally downgraded.

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:16.120
The document was classified top secret until 15 September 1969 and remained largely hidden until

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:23.080
UFO researchers Arthur Bray and Stanton Friedman obtained a copy in 1978. In this letter, Smith

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:29.800
made three astounding claims told to him by a source within Washington regarding UFOs.

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.480
1. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States government,

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:44.040
higher even than the H-bomb. 2. Flying saucers exist. 3. Their modus operandi is unknown,

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:49.080
but concentrated efforts are being made by a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:56.840
4. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:02.760
Wilbert Smith, a man whom Silas Newton shared a tremendous amount of respect for, would go

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.360
on to spearhead Canada's first two UFO programs, Projects Magnet and Second Story.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:15.240
3. Smith was possibly even exposed to technologies of unknown origin by U.S. government officials,

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:21.240
but of course, that is not our story today. The source of Wilbert B. Smith for this profound

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:28.200
memo, 1. Dr. Robert Sarbacher. Sarbacher served as a respected physicist and consultant to

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.720
Vannevar Bush's and the DoD's Research and Development Board in the 1950s under the Truman

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:39.560
administration. The esteemed Harvard graduate and student of Einstein served as the founder and

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:45.480
dean of Georgia Institute of Technology, director of research at WED Labs, scientific consultant

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:50.440
to the U.S. Marines and as mentioned earlier, involved in the Joint Research and Development

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:56.600
Board. Sarbacher's research specialized in remote-controlled rockets, though curiously,

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:02.440
Sarbacher has largely been wiped from the annals of history similar to Dr. Eric Henry Wang.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:09.320
On 15 September 1950, Wilbert Smith interviewed Robert Sarbacher. Smith stated he had read

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.960
Scullies behind the flying saucers and wished to know how much of the book was fact,

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:19.960
to which Sarbacher replied, quote, the facts reported in the book are substantially correct,

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:25.640
end quote. The two would discuss magnetic propulsion systems behind UFOs before Smith's

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:32.040
source would inform Smith of the shocking points made in the 1950 memo. Beginning his research on

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.400
Aztec after being struck by behind-the-flying saucers, William Steinman quickly attempted to

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.880
track down Robert Sarbacher. The accomplished physicist stated he himself had no association

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:49.560
with any of the people involved with UFO crash recoveries and had no specifics on dates of

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:55.640
successful recoveries. However, Sarbacher had been invited to participate in several discussions

01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:01.320
regarding recoveries whilst consulting with the R&D board but was never given access to personally

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:07.320
attend. Sarbacher still did attest meetings regarding UFO crash retrievals were held by

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:12.440
the Military Research and Development Board at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and involved

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:18.200
figures such as John von Neumann, Vannevar Bush, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, three key

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:24.200
U.S. scientists and three figures linked to the Aztec crash. Though he did not receive

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:30.280
materials or photographs, Sarbacher had been privy to UFO crash reports during his official

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:34.520
Pentagon duties. In the direct words of Sarbacher, quote,

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:39.240
About the only thing I remember at this time is that certain materials reported to have come

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.680
from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:50.920
analyzed them very carefully. There were reports that instruments or people operating these machines

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:56.920
were also very lightweight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and acceleration

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:01.800
associated with their machinery. I remember in talking with some of the people at the office

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:07.160
that I got the impression these quote unquote aliens were constructed like certain insects we've

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.440
observed on earth, wherein because of the low mass the inertial forces involved in operation of

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:18.520
these instruments would be quite low. I still do not know why the higher order of classification

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.080
has been given and why the denial of the existence of these devices, end quote.

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.160
Obviously, Sarbacher's described lightweight materials closely resemble the metals described

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.920
from the Roswell and Aztec wreckage. And we do, of course, have a possible paper trail of custody

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:40.600
here. As in my video on Battelle Memorial Institute, I discussed the contractor receiving pieces of the

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:46.840
Roswell wreckage to test on the now coveted material used in many industries such as aerospace and

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:53.080
medical, night and all. However, Sarbacher's description of biologics do somewhat differ here.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:58.840
Certainly, the biologics described in Aztec and Roswell sound far more humanoid than insect,

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:04.120
but this could attest to the likelihood multiple non-human species have visited and crashed on

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:09.480
the planet. As we continue, I would strongly suggest reading the book by Grant Cameron,

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:16.760
UFOs Area 51 and Government Informants. On a future unknown date, Steinman would write to UFO

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.840
researcher Grant Cameron. The letter would discuss friend of Cameron and Steinman,

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:27.320
the legendary Stanton Freedman, had also tracked down Sarbacher in 1983. According to Sarbacher,

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:32.120
quote, I did not attend the meetings at right field concerning the recovered saucers,

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:37.160
but there was one person who attended all of the meetings. I can't remember his name.

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:42.680
He wrote a book on electrical engineering, was a member of the RDB, and was the head of the

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:48.600
electrical engineering department at a university in Pennsylvania, end quote. Based on this statement,

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.960
Steinman did some digging on his own volition and derived a name. Steinman received direct

01:46:53.960 --> 01:47:00.360
confirmation of this name, another one of the most under discussed names in all of UFO lore

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:08.280
and usual of this channel, one Dr. Eric A. Walker. I'm sure he needs no introduction here,

01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:14.760
but let's alongside Sarbacher discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker. The genius that was Dr. Walker was born

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:22.600
in 1910. He received his BS in engineering in 1932, MBA in 1933, and his DSC in 35,

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:27.720
all from Harvard University. In his early professional years, Walker would teach mathematics

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.680
and electrical engineering at Tufts College. Walker would then join the University of Connecticut,

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:37.160
where he taught electrical engineering and initiated courses for a special war training

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:43.400
program. It is widely thought that here is where Walker met Dr. Vannevar Bush and likely became

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:49.560
initiated into UFO programs. During the Second World War, the doctor would join the Underwater

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.720
Sound Laboratory at Harvard University, where he would quickly find himself in charge of

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:59.400
ordinance, specifically weapons. The accomplished scientist studies in Underwater Sound Lab led

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.120
to the creation of the homing torpedo, which shall Walker be awarded with the Naval Ordinance

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:10.520
Development Award and a Presidential Certificate of Merit. By 1944, Walker would join Vannevar

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.560
Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development, and by 45, Walker would join Penn

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:21.160
State University, which he would later become president of. It was at Penn State, at the behest

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:27.720
of the Navy, Walker would create the Applied Research Laboratory, now a DOD-designated U.S. Navy

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:34.920
UARC, or University-affiliated Research Center. Now, I talk in extreme detail in most of my projects

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:40.680
about UARCs and their semi-private corporate counterparts, FFRDCs, Federally Funded Research

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:46.600
and Development Centers. Involvement in UFO legacy program operations, so, reference any of these

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:52.360
projects for more on that topic. Recall how Sarbacher set in 1950, as consultant to the

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:58.440
Defense Research Board, UFO crash retrieval meetings were held at Wright Patterson by the R&D Board

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:05.480
spearheaded by Vannevar Bush. While in that same year of 1950, Walker sat on the R&D Board and would

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:12.520
later go on to serve as its executive secretary from 1950 to 1952. Indeed, Stanton Friedman's

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.720
Sharp Eye uncovered an early 1950s document from the Department of the Army to chairman

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:23.960
of the U.S. Communications Intelligence Board, USCIB. The subject of this document is, quote,

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:29.480
indoctrination for special intelligence for Mr. Eric Arthur Walker, end quote.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:36.200
Walker would go on to assist in many DOD and IC projects, including Project Azorian in 1972,

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:42.440
to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K-129 at the behest of the National Underwater Reconnaissance

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.080
Office. Now this is interesting, as I have directly connected the vessel used,

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:53.160
the Glomar Explorer, and the highly secretive Nuro to undersea UFO crash retrieval operations,

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:59.400
and I highly recommend viewing that project. Throughout the 1980s, the name Dr. Eric A.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:05.720
Walker was kept secret by select UFO investigators, such as Stanton Friedman and William Steinman,

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.480
in hopes the doctor could be convinced to publicly disclose his involvement in UFO crash retrievals

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.640
and material exploitation programs. William Steinman first reached out to Dr. Walker on 19

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:25.000
March 1948. Walker's response was bizarre, to say the least. Dr. Walker typed on the lower portion

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.800
of Steinman's sent letter, and the doctor even cut off Steinman's return address and stamped it

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:36.200
on the front of his envelope, the correspondence read in all caps, quote, Stop. Don't try and

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:43.160
find me. I came on that machine, I will leave May 15, ergo, quiet, quiet, quiet, end quote.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:50.680
Steinman would attempt to contact Walker again on 31 May 1984, with no response. But on 30 August

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:56.920
1987, the ever-persistent Steinman would call Walker, and to his surprise, Walker answered.

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:02.360
Straight to the punch, Steinman told Walker he wished to speak on meetings at Wright Patterson

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.120
in 49-50, concerning military recoveries of flying saucers and their occupants.

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.680
Just as shocking as Walker even answering the call, he would state, quote,

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.120
Yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.080
Why do you want to know about that? End quote.

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:24.840
In this 1987 conversation, Walker would reveal he knew of the Majestic 12, in fact,

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:31.560
he had for 40 years, so all the way back to 1947. Then gave Steinman a bizarre reference to Don

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:37.000
Quixote, quote, I believe that you're chasing after windmills and fighting with windmills.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:43.000
Walker told Steinman the researchers' efforts were futile, but still the doctor would see

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.760
if he could wrangle up any of the 1950 Wright Patterson notes. But to this day, I have heard

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.480
nothing of these notes making their way to the public. Now, I know I'm spending a significant

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:58.360
amount of time on Walker and Sarbacher, but the fact behind the flying saucers containing the

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:03.880
Aztec story led to the discovery of two of the most critical and understudied individuals in the

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:09.480
subject is paramount to our investigation. Several UFO researchers would approach Walker

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:13.560
in the late 1980s, but few were able to speak with him.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:19.640
In conversations with Henry Azad de Hel, aka Armin Victorian, Walker would reveal he was present

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:26.040
for the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash retrieval, an all-time favorite case of mine.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:31.240
Walker would tell Victorian, quote, Only a couple people are capable of handling this issue.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:36.120
Unless your mind ability is like Einstein's or likewise, I do not think you can achieve

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:42.520
anything, end quote. Walker would even bring up ESP, extra sensory perception, stating, quote,

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.360
How good is your sixth sense? How much do you know about ESP,

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:52.600
unless you know about it and how to use it? You would not be taken in. Only a few know about it,

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:57.720
end quote. Believe it or not, we could spend another two hours here on Walker and cover

01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:04.280
perplexing coded letters returned to Steinman, 1988 conversations with T. Scott Crane stating

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:10.360
Walker would no longer speak on UFOs and much more. What secrets could Walker have possibly

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:18.600
held onto regarding Aztec? My wager many as Walker joined the DRB one year following the incident, 1949.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:29.320
Integral to Steinman's 1986 reconstruction of the Aztec retrieval is the interplanetary

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:35.880
phenomenon unit, or IPU, as we will call it from here on out. I have discussed the IPU many times

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:41.400
before, including speaking on the documents with Ryan Wood, who has served alongside his late father,

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:46.520
Dr. Robert Wood, as the premier researchers attempting to authenticate or disprove the

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:52.120
majestic 12 documents. Since the IPU is so integral to piecing together the retrieval,

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:57.000
let's spend some time reviewing the infamous interplanetary phenomenon unit.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.480
Now frustratingly, Steinman never presented strong evidence for why IPU, stationed out of Camp Hale,

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:10.200
Colorado, was the on-site military team securing the craft and crash LZ, only reporting the word

01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:17.240
from sources. Steinman was, however, one of the trailblazing researchers to prove the IPU's existence.

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:24.360
Like just about everything related to Majestic 12, or UFO crash retrievals, IPU is not without

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.720
controversy. Researchers such as Brad Sparks and Kevin Randall have professed quote-unquote

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:35.960
truth about the IPU, claiming this unit was no more than the input-processing unit of Army

01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:42.920
Intelligence's later Army AFSTC, Foreign Science and Technology Center. Basically, IPU was the

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:49.080
incoming document's mailroom for Army S&T post-Sputnik in the 1968 Space Era.

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:55.720
Sparks claims the IP moniker has been misrepresented as interplanetary phenomenon because the real

01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:02.440
unit to him did handle the receipt and forwarding of UFO reports. FOIA documents we will discuss

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:08.120
have labeled the IPU as existing through quote-unquote institutional memory. Sparks believe this is

01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:15.240
because Army FOIA officers have simply misremembered around the IPU. Now, I find great fault in this

01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:21.240
reporting and very little research of substance, but now that we have addressed the IPU counterpoints,

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:26.360
let's begin to dive in. We will primarily address the work of Robert and Ryan Wood,

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:31.800
as well as UFO researcher Anthony Bergalea here. Please check out their respective sites,

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:39.320
MajesticDocuments.com and UFOExplorations.com. In 1980, the late Richard Hall, Associate of

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.600
Mufon and NiCAP, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the U.S. Army, requesting

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:51.000
information concerning Army Intelligence records relating to UFOs. It is unknown and debated if

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.760
Hall actually said the words interplanetary phenomenon unit in his FOIA letter. Hall was

01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:01.560
advised by Colonel William Guild, Director of Army Counterintelligence, that quote,

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.360
please be advised that the interplanetary phenomenon unit of the Scientific and Technical

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.480
Branch Counterintelligence Directorate was disestablished in the late 1950s and never

01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:16.840
reactivated. All records pertaining to this unit were surrendered to the U.S. Air Force Office of

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:23.400
Special Investigations with Operation Blue Book, end quote. Fast forwarding to 1984, we find Steinman

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:29.560
conducting similar FOIAs for IPU. Steinman was additionally told the IPU was disestablished

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:34.360
and all records were transferred to USAF in the late 1950s. According to Lieutenant Colonel

01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:40.040
Lance Cornyn, the IPU was formed as an in-house project as an interest item for an Assistant

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:45.960
Chief of Staff for Intelligence. The IPU was never a unit or formally recognized mission

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:52.920
or authority, only through institutional memory did the Army CIC have any recollection of the IPU.

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:59.880
Let's fast forward again to 1987 to above top secret author Timothy Good, who filed similar FOIAs.

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:06.440
Good was given the exact same spiel as Steinman and Hall. Good was given the same spiel as Steinman

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:12.120
and Hall. So, what can we learn from these FOIAs? A. The Army confirmed with the Army

01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:18.120
Department of Counterintelligence there was in fact an interplanetary phenomenon unit or IPU.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:25.400
B. The IPU was disestablished in the late 1950s. C. The IPU records were quote-unquote

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:31.400
surrender to the Air Force in conjunction with Project Blue Book. D. The unit was a quote-unquote

01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:36.440
in-house project as an interest item for an unnamed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.320
E. The unit lacked formal function, mission, or authority. F. It is only through quote-unquote

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:47.000
institutional memory that the Army knows of the IPU's existence.

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:52.680
If IPU records were given over to Project Blue Book, why are there no records of IPU

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:58.040
in Blue Book's many reports? With the Army's response, it is clear there is recollection of

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:04.920
IPU, but the Army CIC is not forthcoming about information or records. Years later, Kufon,

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:11.800
or the computer UFO network, received a reply from AFOSI that IPU material had been destroyed,

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:18.600
but offered no further information. This contradicts Army reports the IPU maintained no

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:23.480
records. Some further intriguing breadcrumbs have been reported by Anthony Burgalia.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:30.360
The Defense Central Index of Investigations, DCII, is a DOD Automated Control Index that

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:36.200
identifies and reports on investigations conducted by all DOD investigative agencies.

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:41.320
Essentially, this served as the most complex and comprehensive acknowledged military

01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:47.080
and intelligence data center in existence. In the early 1980s, researcher John Frick

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:52.840
became aware of DCII computer printouts made under the command of the legendary general

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:58.920
Douglas MacArthur that related to UFO sightings and investigations. The first line of the short

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:09.560
quote, I have not seen this printout reproduced, but if real, fully destroys the IPU counterargument

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:16.520
proposed by Brad Sparks. Frick even stated some of his sources, such as the former AFOSI agent

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:24.360
Rudolph M. Schelmar, revealed that MacArthur's IPU files were indeed transferred in 1962 to AFOSI.

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:29.720
Perhaps IPU really did operate under MacArthur. After all, the general would discuss quote

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:37.240
unquote interplanetary war in 1955 and 1962 addresses. Remember here, Army FOIA stated

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:44.280
IPU was an interest item for a joint chief of staff for intelligence, aka a G2. MacArthur's G2

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:49.400
was Colonel Charles A. Willoughby, who later became chief of MacArthur's intelligence staff.

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:54.840
Willoughby also retired as a major general. Brigalia reported Willoughby was even equated

01:59:54.840 --> 02:00:00.680
with the legendary Philip J. Corso. However, researchers such as Timothy Good suggest the

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:06.600
IPU did not operate directly under MacArthur, but by someone from even higher rank, MacArthur's

02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:13.160
immediate superior, General George C. Marshall, Army chief of staff and later US Secretary of

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:19.320
Defense. George C. Marshall is additionally considered by the woods as the origin for the IPU

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:25.800
and remember William Steinman reported Marshall himself mobilized the IPU for the Aztec retrieval.

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.680
Now let's move into discussing the IPU as it appears throughout the majestic documents.

02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:35.960
I'm going to skip over Thomas Cantwell, the enigmatic self-proclaimed IPU member who gave

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:40.760
several majestic document drops to Timothy Cooper. So if you want to learn more about him,

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.440
go watch my Majestic Documents investigation with Ryan Wood.

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:48.040
If you are wondering why I am mentioning majestic documents at all,

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:53.480
I additionally recommend watching that same piece. Within the majestic documents are two files

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:59.240
alleged to be records from the IPU themselves. The interplanetary phenomenon unit field order

02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:07.240
dated July 1947, given to Tim Cooper by Cantwell via UPS between 1993 and 1996,

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:15.560
as well as the IPU report dated July 1947, given to Cooper from Cantwell personally in July of 1995.

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:20.840
Now the quote-unquote leak dates of these IPU documents should put to bed any theory

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:26.920
Steinman took the IPU reports at face value and constructed his Aztec case around the two documents.

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:31.400
Outside of the two alleged internal IPU documents, there are several majestic

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:37.480
documents that mention the IPU. These include a 5 March 1942 memo from George Marshall to

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.360
President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussing the recovery of an unidentified airplane following

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:48.280
the infamous 1942 Battle of Los Angeles. Marshall says in this disputed document,

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:53.960
the craft was likely of interplanetary origin and suggested a special intelligence unit be

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.000
created for further investigation of the phenomenon. But let's start here with the short

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:06.360
IPU field order dated July 4, 1947 and marked top secret. The one page memo directs a commanding

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:11.800
officer to take a counterintelligence team to a UFO crash site and report to the G2 at

02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:17.240
Conrant Field, New Mexico, which is of course Roswell. The commanding officer was to take a

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:23.160
non-commission OIC, an aeronautical engineer, a scientist, a security officer, and a medical

02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:30.520
doctor and to provide a report by the 28th of July. The IPU report, dated July 22, 1947,

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.320
gives us far more to work with and let's break this down a little bit as I have connected this

02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:40.360
document to various crash retrievals in the past. The intelligence assessment references

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:47.480
recovery of multiple fallen objects from 4 to 6 July 1947. This possibly lends credence to Roswell

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:53.960
featuring multiple UFO crash retrievals. Now the document was prepared by the Army IPU, Scientific

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.800
and Technical Branch, Counterintelligence Directorate at the behest of G2, the exact same descriptors of

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:06.040
IPU given to 1980s researchers from FOIA. But to play devil's advocate, this document released

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:12.760
in 1995. So if it is a hoax, the authors of the hoax could have easily copied known IPU details

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:17.880
from researchers such as Steinman and Hall. What interests me here though is mention of

02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:23.720
a special radiobiological team accompanied by an SED and security detail from Sandian

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:29.400
National Labs under orders from Colonel Hasbrook. Armed forces special weapons project being

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:35.000
ordered to secure the immediate area surrounding the Roswell crash site. Select scientists from

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.120
the Atomic Energy Commission were amongst this team, including Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer,

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:45.320
father of the atomic bomb, an accused member of the Aztec crash by Steinman a little less than

02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:51.640
one decade earlier. But that's not all. The IPU also stated Dr. Detlev Bronk was in charge of

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:57.800
biologic autopsies just as in the Aztec case. The document states President Truman would be given

02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:02.520
a limited briefing on the incident by General Hoyt Vandenberg, but that General Eisenhower,

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.480
later president, would actually be shown the recovery of the wreckage. According to majestic

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:14.120
documents lore, the 1952 Eisenhower briefing document disclosed details of Roswell to Eisenhower.

02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:19.560
If he had already been briefed by the IPU, why the double briefing? Well, this could be explained

02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:25.000
as the illustrious MJ-12 was established according to the Eisenhower briefing document later in

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.080
September 1947, so the double briefing makes sense. The ties between Aztec, Roswell,

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:38.200
and Maj. 12 are indeed intriguing as the IPU report states George Marshall was the only cabinet member

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.880
to date to know about crashed UFOs, but that Secretary of Defense James Forstall would be

02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:50.440
briefed on certain aspects. In Maj. 12 lore, Truman and Forstall engaged in September 1947

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:56.200
meetings to establish the Majestic-12. To learn more about Forstall and his untimely demise,

02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:01.880
I also again recommend watching my Maj. 12 video. Just as in the Aztec case,

02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:07.400
recovered craft were stored at Los Alamos and access was gate kept by one Lieutenant General

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:14.200
Collins. Now addressing point nine in the document here, I have connected this to the 1974 Koyama

02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:20.520
Mexico UFO crash retrieval, a fascinating and scintillating case. According to the document,

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:26.440
Sandia Personnel suffered some sort of form of non-human containment breach, possibly hazardous

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:32.280
liquids or gas, and three technicians were killed. Ultimately here, the study of the IPU

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:37.720
does not lead us to any hard conclusions. The illustrious unit exists, but its memories and

02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:43.480
records have been destroyed. I do find it utterly fascinating the sources of Steinman informed him,

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:49.080
Marshall, and the IPU helmed the Aztec recovery many years before the quote unquote leaks of

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:54.920
these documents. And although these Maj. 12 IPU documents released years after Steinman's research

02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:59.400
are rightly disputed and we cannot lean on them for any definitive statements,

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:05.160
they paint striking parallels between the Roswell crash and Aztec crash just eight months later.

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:15.080
Like any good crash retrieval case before his passing, the legendary Leonard Stringfield wrote

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:20.840
about, connected with sources, and reported on Aztec. Viewers of my channel will absolutely

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:26.680
recognize I often celebrate Stringfield and his UFO crash retrieval status reports one through seven

02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:32.440
as the best work on UFO crash retrieval operations period. Stringfield was approached by Steinman

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:39.320
in 1985 to write the foreword for the 1986 epic that is the ultra rare UFO crash at Aztec a well

02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:44.520
kept secret. In his foreword, Stringfield wrote he was incredibly hesitant to re-engage with the

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:49.400
case. Stringfield admitted he too had been conditioned that the case was nothing more than

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:56.360
a hoax, schemed by Silas Newton and his dubious partner in crime, Leo Gabauer. Stringfield stated

02:06:56.360 --> 02:07:02.120
he was equally initially swindled by debunks presented by William or Bill Moore at a Mouffon

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:09.240
symposium in 1985. Moore would around 1989 admit he was working with the US intelligence community

02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:12.200
to sow disinformation into the subject of UFOs.

02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:52.680
Steinman's convictions and thoroughness led to Stringfield re-engaging with the case,

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:59.560
but what history did he have with Aztec? Let's travel back to 1974 when Aztec had long been

02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:05.960
labeled a hoax due to the sketchy reporting of JP Kahn. One John Spencer Carr, a retired South

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:10.360
Florida professor of mass communications at the University of South Florida Tampa,

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:15.400
went public with what he professed to be new information regarding the Aztec incident in

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:21.560
October of 1974. Fortunately, Steinman obtained clippings of Carr's testimony in an October

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:28.200
1974 Clearwater Sun issue. Carr stated he had in his possession what he deemed to be credible

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:34.280
information regarding Aztec, disclosed to him by five sources including a senior USAF official

02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.560
involved in the retrieval. Carr claimed the craft and bodies of Aztec were flown to Edwards

02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:45.480
Air Force Base and ultimately taken to Wright Patterson. Two locations I do strongly suspect

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:51.160
are engaged in UFO legacy program operations, but almost as soon as it was resurrected,

02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:57.480
Aztec was once again demolished shortly after in 1975 in an article in official UFO by Mike

02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:05.000
McKellen titled the UFO crash of 1948 is a hoax. Admittedly, Carr did seemingly report many of

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:11.000
the Aztec details incorrectly or was confusing Aztec with another case, claiming a crash date

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.400
of 12 February 48, claiming military men approached a 30 foot saucer with guns drawn and the presence

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:23.400
of 12 non-human bodies dead from decompression. In the interest of time, we will not cover Carr's

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:29.000
claims in McKellen's debunk as we did Newton and Kahn, but where does Stringfield fit in here?

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.800
Carr and Stringfield would speak extensively after Carr went public in 1974, but Carr would

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:41.000
never reveal his sources. On 6 February 1982, Carr, fearing his own mortality, would disclose

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.520
the name of his Air Force source to Stringfield in Leonard's own words, quote. When Professor

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:52.360
Carr named his source, I sat back dumbfounded. I knew his name well in research and recalled some of

02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:58.120
the source's comments on UFOs while he served as an Air Force officer. But Carr was quick to tie

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:03.640
a string to his disclosure, stating please Len, keep the name to yourself, please spare me any

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:10.040
trouble as long as I live, end quote. Carr and ultimately Steinman would reignite Stringfield's

02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:17.400
waning interest in Aztec and by 1989 in UFO crash retrieval status report five, Stringfield was writing

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:22.600
again about Aztec and mentioning the case in the same sentences as Roswell and Kingman,

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:29.480
two crashes I and many others place extreme confidence in. In 1991 status report six,

02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:34.200
Stringfield would discuss and reproduce a fascinating new witness to the Aztec case.

02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.400
Stringfield was given permission to reproduce the report on the crash at Farmington,

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:46.440
written in 1991 by Chuck Oldham. Oldham had in 1990 come in contact with an Aztec informant,

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:51.080
a former alleged military officer with high security clearances. And together,

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:56.280
the two published the witness's disclosures, as well as diagrams and images of the craft and

02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:02.520
biologics. The witness described accessing classified files, discussing crashed alien craft

02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.880
in their occupants. Within the files, the witness stumbled upon what was an image of a perfectly

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:14.200
intact circular shaped craft, lying tilted five to 10 degrees on one side on the ground in the

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:19.880
desert. The craft was metallic, appearing similar to brushed aluminum. There did not appear to be a

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:25.320
crater or ground surface disturbance caused by the impact. The report referenced to the image

02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.040
and craft in great detail. The witness claimed the report listed the craft was retrieved near the

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:36.440
town of Farmington, New Mexico, just south of Aztec prior to 1950. The report stated, but the

02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:41.720
witness was unable to confirm in the photographs that the dome part of the saucer featured porthole

02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.840
type features, though they were not made of any glass. Just like the Aztec story goes,

02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:53.000
one porthole had a puncture, the diameter of a pencil. The report listed the retrieval team tried

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.280
diamond drills, acetylene torches, and more on the porthole, but nothing was able to damage the

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.760
craft and porthole. This reminds me closely of the 1963 RB case I covered in UFO whistleblowers

02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:10.840
volume two. And just like the rest of our Aztec testimonies, an accidental fiddling of the damaged

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.640
porthole led to the craft opening. One point here, though, is at odds with the rest of our

02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:20.680
Aztec discussion. The witness claimed the craft was 30-something feet in diameter.

02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.840
The beams inside, according to Oldham Source, were four foot tall humanoids,

02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:30.920
badly charred, wearing a strong woven fabric flight suit. The report author concludes the craft

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:36.920
likely operated on magnetic or gravitational fields to travel great distances in a minuscule

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:37.720
amount of time.

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:13.480
Not so sure about the Aztec case. Since that time, there have been multiple individuals that I respect

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:17.240
quite a bit who have talked about this case and said there's a little more than meets the eye than

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:23.880
the JP Kahn debunk. Of course, with Ross Goldhardt on Jesse Michael saying, Nat Kobitz

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:28.920
directly or strongly inferred or directly told him that the Aztec case was real,

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:34.920
I thought, well, now might be the time to dive in and give this case a fair shake as possible.

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.760
If you're like me and arrive at similar conclusions, I do wager that this case likely

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:46.920
happened and I do wager it's a very complicated case. Similar to Roswell, we might be confusing

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:52.280
details of multiple cases. With the UFO report, the crash at Farmington and some other witness

02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:58.840
testimony, specifically Professor Carr, multiple individuals talk about a 30-plus foot saucer

02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:04.360
crashing and not a 99.9 diameter disc. Maybe there's some details getting confused here,

02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:10.760
but believe it or not, and I know I say this in every video, I think this project really

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:15.080
only scratches the surface of Aztec. Remember how much time we devoted to

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:22.840
IPU? Well, as it turns out, there's even more majestic documents. I don't know if you can see

02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:28.120
it on the camera right here that involve Aztec. Now, why did I not include this right here?

02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:35.800
This 45-page, I think it's a DIA majestic document that Ryan and Robert Wood have not even discussed

02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:42.280
very long. Well, this is because this document drop came out in 2017 through a radio show host

02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:47.080
from a trusted source. I can't remember the woman's name right now. I believe it's her first name,

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:51.720
Heather. But I would like to get in contact with her to find out who this trusted source is. Of

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:58.440
course, a majestic documents drop in 2017 is decades beyond when the majority of documents drop

02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:04.600
between 1984 and 1996, let's say. So I'm quite intrigued why this specific set of documents

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:11.800
was leaked in 2017, a very critical date in UFO lore. But the reason I didn't speak about this is

02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:17.240
because this document says some pretty bizarre things, pretty outlandish things specifically

02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:25.080
about Nikola Tesla. It reads almost like a novel. It's a really good read, which is

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:30.120
kind of why I take apprehension here. But also because this majestic document, again,

02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:32.760
I'll put it right up here and I'll put the link in the video description,

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:39.800
pretty much tells the Aztec case verbatim in the same style of story as Steinman.

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:44.360
So it talks about IPU. It talks about all the recovery methods Steinman talks about. So

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.440
one of my preliminary theories here is that this document drop, of course, as soon as a ton of

02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:55.960
interest starts back up in UFOs around 2017, quite possibly this document drop was meant to muddy

02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:03.240
the water surrounding the Aztec case. And maybe by recovering Steinman's account of the case that

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.800
it just means, hey, Steinman could have ripped this off a random majestic document that existed

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.880
way back in the day. So that's why I didn't include this. And speaking of Steinman and

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:18.440
majestic documents, you know, the IPU report and field order dropped in 1995 in 1996, I believe

02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.480
are the dates off the top of my head. Now, one of the things I grappled with back and forth is,

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:29.880
did Steinman have a previous experience with these documents? And he constructed his Aztec case

02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:35.800
based upon the IPU report specifically, because as we know, General George Marshall, others,

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:43.240
the IPU, the Sandia, Los Alamos are mentioned within that document. But I, and perhaps there

02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:48.280
could be creams here, because the same thing with Dr. Eric Walker, Steinman did keep his name secret

02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:52.360
for quite a few years and hope that, you know, Walker would speak out, perhaps there's a world

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:57.480
in which that majestic document was released to some researchers back in the 80s, the IPU reports.

02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:02.440
And it was kept a little secret until Thomas Cantwheel gave the documents to Timothy Cooper

02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:10.840
back in 1996, I believe the IPU report was. But I digress, there's nothing to substantiate that

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:16.760
theories, but it is interesting nonetheless. And again, this ultra top secret majestic report

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:22.680
from the DIA comes out in 2017, telling the Steinman account of Aztec verbatim. So,

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.960
I'm not quite sure what to do with this document. Perhaps I'll make a majestic documents follow

02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:32.920
up part two where we can analyze some of the more controversial documents,

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:40.200
project Aquarius, maybe this document and some others. So maybe we'll do that in the future.

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:45.240
But I'd like to know what you guys think about this video. I mean, I'll tell you what right now.

02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.320
I don't think I've ever said the word doodle bug so much in my life. It was pretty tough

02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:54.280
recording the script, trying to talk about magnetic anomaly detection devices and Carl

02:17:54.280 --> 02:18:02.040
Highland and RSI. I mean, geospatial services, Inc. GSI, my apologies, and try and say doodle

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:07.160
bug with a straight face. But when I found Texas Instrument in 1980, their 30 year history is

02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:12.360
saying, Hey, we pay respects to our doodle buggers back in the day. I got a little bit more relaxed

02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:18.200
about saying such things. So I know in this video, there was a lot of information discussed. And

02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:25.320
you know, if you're going to purchase one book or pursue one lead after this, I can't recommend

02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:31.400
enough buying the Ramses book that I have right here. The book is it is fantastic. It is exactly

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:38.200
how I like to do research. All sources are always cited. There's a massive reference tab. There's

02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.360
numerous pictures. I mean, there's stuff I didn't even speak about in this video, such as the Ramses

02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:47.240
hiring, you know, various professionals who weren't even into UFOs to reconstruct how the

02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:51.880
Hart Canyon roads could have been used to transport the huge disk to Los Alamos. So

02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:57.240
a ton more groundwork in that book. And, you know, I barely even scratched the surface with it.

02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:03.560
And of course, we got the big boy here. This step certainly put a dent in my pocket. It's a pretty

02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:09.320
expensive book. But if I was going to do a video on Aztec, I needed the book. There's so much awesome

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:16.280
artwork and some truly astonishing things written by Steinman here. I expressed it multiple times

02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:23.960
in the video, but I do have frustration. Steinman so cavalierly discusses, as fact, hey, the IPU

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:31.320
retrieved the disk, General George Marshall got the call, you know, Highlands, sorry, Oppenheimer,

02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:37.400
Vannevar Bush, they were all there at the site, especially Chirur and Dr. Detlef Bronck, but

02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:44.520
doesn't give any, you know, references to his sources or even corroborating evidence. So although

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:49.880
he has a ton of exhibits throughout the book, and these include scanned documents, JP Kahn's debunk,

02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:56.120
Mike McKellen's debunk, Robert Carr's testimony, he does lack there. So that is my biggest critique

02:19:56.120 --> 02:20:01.160
of the book. But I do think it's excellent, especially the work on Dr. Eric Henry Wang.

02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:08.760
That is a thread that continues to persist to my research today. Who was Wang? Why can I find

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:17.080
nothing about him besides the odd civil engineering atribune to him as he's passed and

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:21.400
solely his mention in Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which of course, Arthur Stanzel claimed he worked

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:27.800
under Dr. Eric Henry Wang for the Kingman incident and that Dr. Wang spearheaded the

02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:32.680
reverse engineering and retrieval efforts for that. So the parallels between Aztec, Roswell,

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:38.760
and Kingman, I know I said in the video, are endless. These cases seem to be handled and

02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:43.640
executed the recoveries in an extremely similar manner. You can kind of tell with the Aztec case

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:48.440
what's interesting to me is different methods and approaches after the folly that was Roswell.

02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:53.160
And that included when that knucklehead Silas Newton started talking about the event.

02:20:54.120 --> 02:21:00.920
Did Carl Highland discuss to Leo Cabauer and Silas Newton? Was he the informant of Aztec?

02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:05.960
Maybe. I know that Steinman really presses this and I really applaud his theory there.

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:12.520
But if we could just have tangible evidence that under Highland's company, Leo Cabauer worked

02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:17.880
there or Cabauer and Highland worked together in Antarctica in the 30s, like Steinman said,

02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:25.080
the thesis would be so much stronger. I mean, even if we had evidence that Cabauer worked for Dr. Paul

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:31.880
Scherer in the kind of cryogenic containment units meant to freeze the biologics, we'd have so much

02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:38.200
more to chew on there. And let me know what you think about the court case as well. I've never

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:43.720
covered court proceedings before, but I found it pretty interesting, especially Dr. James Meredith

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:48.760
of Colorado School of Mines, who was indeed in the same department as Highland, testifying that

02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:57.240
the Doodle Bug could not find oil, let alone a submarine, and he analyzed war surplus store

02:21:57.240 --> 02:22:03.560
parts that was quote unquote very similar to the Doodle Bug purchased for $4.45. We also proved

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:08.680
whether it's the work of GSI, even patents from Vannevar Bush and other patents that

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:15.880
magnetic anomaly detection devices or reflective seismograph technology, both of these, for the

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:22.040
sole purpose of finding oil was extensively utilized pre-World War II. And then in World War II,

02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.520
many of the corporations or many of the brightest minds that are working on reflective seismology

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:32.040
or MADs to detect oil are brought in by Vannevar Bush to the OSRD to make submarine detecting

02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:38.840
equipment. So that is relayed by Scully in the 50s for the secret war projects. That is some very

02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:43.720
tangible stuff to work with. What else do we have that's tangible to work with? We have the Sting

02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:51.320
operation in 50 from CID and FBI. That is interesting. We have discussions of J. Edgar Hoover

02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:57.560
messaging about Silas Newton. Now, I don't blame individuals for at the beginning of this video

02:22:57.560 --> 02:23:01.720
if they made it all through the end first saying, Gerb, why are you covering Aztec? It was proven

02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:07.080
a hoax. I was victim of this as well. As I said at the beginning of this rant, so was Leonard

02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:12.680
Stringfield. And I love that in the forward to William Steinman's book Leonard Stringfield said,

02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:18.600
I was taken by the work of J. Pecan and Bill Moore. Bill Moore, of course, we showed him on

02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:23.560
the move on Symposium in 89 saying he was working with intelligence agencies. Perhaps Bill Moore,

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:27.480
you know, there's some theories floating around that Bill Moore and Richard Doty made some majestic

02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:33.560
documents. Maybe they had a hand in this puppy right here. But let's discuss Aztec Moore. I

02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:38.040
say this again, this is just to kickstart research into this case. And I want to know what everybody

02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:43.080
thinks. And, you know, before we log off for the day, a couple of action items. I was just

02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:52.920
out of town for a to go on a show. And there I got to meet an individual who's making a documentary.

02:23:54.680 --> 02:24:01.960
I got a signed poster here from Mr. Luigi. I think it's Vendett Tilley, right?

02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:07.880
For Project Gravitar. You know, I had been interested in this case in this documentary

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:13.000
since I met Chris Ramsey back at the November hearings. And he was telling me all about,

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.840
hey, you know, I've been talking to Luigi, I've been paying attention to Gravitar,

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:21.080
and there's going to be a lot they're talking about Bob Lazar in this new documentary. If you

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:25.080
know anything about me, you'll know I've been infatuated with the story of Bob since I was a

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:30.920
wee youngster. But I tend not to talk about Bob because I am so biased towards him. And I will

02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:36.360
always acknowledge that more than anything, I want to believe Bob Lazar. So I tend to

02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:43.080
not be able to critically analyze pro or con statements with Bob. So I tend to keep him out.

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:50.040
But I got to see some stuff with Project Gravitar. And guys, please be excited. This is awesome.

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:54.760
This is exactly what I wanted from the Jeremy Corbell documentary. Luigi said to me,

02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:00.680
you know, maybe I'm putting too much information in. And guys, if you're watching this channel and

02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:08.280
made it here, we like too much information. So Project Gravitar is very strict on reducing drama,

02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:14.200
following leads, especially names, full names. You know, you might have heard some names

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:19.240
associated with Bob's case, but we're talking full names and identified individuals. And

02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:29.160
the photorealistic recreated S4 is something to behold. That is wicked, wicked, wicked cool.

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:34.120
So yeah, if you see my wall, you already see the sports model drawn by Bob and the propulsion

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.280
system by Bob. Now I'm going to have this signed Project Gravitar poster by Bob. So

02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:44.360
it's turned into a bit of a Volkanovski and Bob shrine. If anybody has some awesome artwork

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:48.520
they would like to send in, please let me know. And I'll give you kind of like a PO box or a

02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:52.840
shipping address because I would love to hang up some diagrams, some really cool art on the wall.

02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:58.920
So please get in contact with me, uapgurb at gmail.com or uapgurb at protonmail.com. And

02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:02.680
let's get that started because I want to feature some more artwork. Channel wise,

02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:05.560
I got some huge stuff coming up for the channel that I'm pretty excited about.

02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:12.200
You know, a lot of huge projects like this. It seems like every project I make these days,

02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.680
I can't really get it under an hour and 45 minutes. So we'll just keep rolling with that.

02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:21.160
I got some good ideas in the tank and some good stuff coming up outside of the channel too and

02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:28.600
stuff around the channel. So please keep up with that. Remember guys, I do have a Patreon,

02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.880
I'd love if you went and subscribed and gave me money every month. I don't gatekeep content,

02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:37.960
so there's no restricted content on there. Or I'll probably start up YouTube memberships as

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:43.320
well. So feel free to give me money every month there. I don't gatekeep content. So only give

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.160
what you think the channel is worth. But if you're not going to do that, totally fine,

02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:50.760
please at least like and subscribe the video, give me a comment what you think. I am just thrilled

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:55.400
that everybody is here watching and I'm incredibly blessed to have people watching the videos,

02:26:55.400 --> 02:27:00.440
making it all the way through. So thank you so much. And again, let me know what you thought

02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:05.160
about the Aztec case. This is just the beginning of me talking about it. So with that being said,

02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:10.120
remember to like and subscribe. Let me know what you think and I will see everybody on the next

02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:12.520
show. Thank you so much. Bye.
