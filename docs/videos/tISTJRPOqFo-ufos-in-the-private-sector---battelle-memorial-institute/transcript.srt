1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Meet Battelle Memorial Institute, a private non-profit applied sciences and technology

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,600
development company whose mission is to, quote, deliver scientific discovery and applied

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,160
research that makes the world a better place to live.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,560
This private non-profit has a prolific list of USG-contracted work, including classified

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
SAPs.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,920
Battelle has a storied history in the technological development of our US society, including research

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,480
into the fabrication of uranium for the Manhattan Project from 39 to 52, development of the

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,600
photocopy machine and UPC barcode system, work on combustion, electronics, energy, conversion,

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,640
propellants, all for Apollo 11, and military research into biological and chemical weapons

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,040
slash defense systems and more.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,880
Today, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at Los

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,320
Alamos National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, as well

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,720
as Oak Ridge National Lab, all of which are DOE-sponsored labs.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,200
So we already see some ties here with Battelle and the USG UAP work in Los Alamos and the

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
DOE.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
But what if I told you, Battelle is harboring a dark secret, that the company has a long

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,800
history of studying UFOs, aiding the USG and USAF in the UFO cover-up, and has even conducted

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,640
analysis on UFO material.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,840
Hey guys, it is UAP Gerb and we are finally going to start to dive into one of the most

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
fascinating aspects of the UFO phenomena, the private sector's connection to the study

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
of UFOs.

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,200
Numerous key figures such as David Grush, Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Eric Davis, former

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,960
Senator Harry Reid, and more have made direct statements that USG defense contractors have

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,200
a direct hand in the reverse engineering and crash retrieval of UAP.

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,640
So today we are going to dive into one such company with real dirty hands on work of UFO

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,560
material and research, the Battelle Memorial Institute.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,720
The earliest tracing of Battelle and UFOs goes to something called Project Stork.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,000
In 1952, the director of the Central Intelligence received a memorandum titled Flying Saucers,

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,880
which detailed an arrangement between ATIC, the Air Force Technology Intelligence Committee,

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,120
and Battelle Memorial Institute for the contractor to establish a machine indexing system for

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,000
official reports of UFO sightings.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,080
On the 9th of January, 1953, Battelle's Dr. Howard C. Cross proposes that the ongoing

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,160
Project Stork, quote, assists the Air Force in reassuring the public that everything

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,800
is well under control with respect to the UFO problem.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,400
At the time, this memo was classified secret and even calls to attention Captain Edward

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
J. Ruppelt, the project's sign, grudge, and bluebook director.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,600
I've talked about him in the history of the stigma, so check that video out if you haven't.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,960
If you'll remember from that same video, in 1953, the Robertson Panel was conducted

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:12,440
to ensure that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status

40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,240
and suggest the public there is no legitimate evidence of their existence.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,080
While the Robertson Panel was conducted, Battelle had been commissioned around the same time

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,000
to separately analyze all Air Force UFO cases away from bluebook or these official panels

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,880
under codename STORK.

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,920
This project paralleled to bluebook and was even mentioned by J. Allen Heineck during

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,480
his attempted testimony at the Robertson Panel.

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,800
Thanks to the efforts of SUFON, the computer UFO network, I have been able to find all

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
seven Project STORK status reports.

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,440
That is another analysis for another day, however, all parts of course will be provided

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,560
in the video description.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,720
On the 5th of May, 1955, Battelle and ATIC published a comprehensive analysis of 3,200

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,880
UFO sightings titled Special Report 14.

52
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,320
This report concluded that UFO are not aerial aircraft beyond human scientific knowledge

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,200
because no physical matter had ever been recorded from any UFO sighting.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,480
But if we dig deeper, there is a massive contradiction here from Battelle's claim that no physical

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
matter had ever been recovered.

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Six years earlier in 1949, Battelle had been contracted by none other than Wright-Patterson

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Air Force Base to perform analysis on shape memory alloys.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,280
See on screen now and in the video notes the first and second progress report covering the

59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:39,760
period of September 1st to October 21st, 1949 on research and development of titanium alloys.

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:49,880
The bulk of these investigations focus on Nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy, a metal

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,800
that would not be officially discovered until 1961 by Dr. William J. Bueller.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,920
So Battelle was performing analysis on the nickel-titanium shape metal alloy, now known

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,360
as Nitinol, over 10 years prior to its official discovery?

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
Well what exactly is Nitinol?

65
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,480
For you material scientists out there and I am not one of you, Nitinol has the unique

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,200
properties of super-elasticity and shape memory.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,600
The metal can be subjected to high levels of stress and snap back to its original shape

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,080
when pressure is released, showing no deformation on the material.

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,440
Nitinol is also elastochloric where the material heats up when exposed to a mechanical force

70
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
field.

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
When this heat is released into the environment and the force field is removed, the material

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,240
super cools and extracts the same amount of heat from the environment again.

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,560
If I am not stressing this enough, Nitinol is a remarkable material that is exceedingly

74
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,440
difficult to manufacture due to the exceptionally high and tight compositional control required

75
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,340
and the tremendous reactivity of titanium.

76
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,360
The material is even used for thermal and electrical actuators, implants due to the

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,480
material's biocompatibility and structural dampening.

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,020
So again, Battelle was contracted to perform a material analysis on an alloy that is exceedingly

79
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,000
difficult to make, requiring vacuum arc remelting or vacuum induction remelting to manufacture

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,500
today in the 21st century, but had this material in the late 40s specifically 1949?

81
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,880
And does this alloy not sound almost exactly like the material that was discovered in the

82
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,720
1947 Roswell crash, that Jesse Marcell described as an exceedingly light metal that would retain

83
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
its shape after deformation?

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,480
And remember, Jesse Marcell was a military officer who was taken to the UFO crash debris

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,360
field with rancher Mac Brazel, who discovered these materials and then was later told by

86
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,780
General Rami to pose with balsa wood and aluminum foil to push the weather balloon theory and

87
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,380
all of this is in Marcell's own words.

88
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,780
More damming is that this debris from a UFO was supposedly shipped to none other than,

89
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,460
you guessed it, Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

90
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:16,100
So to summarize, I am directly inferring that the 1947 Roswell crash led to the discovery

91
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,080
of the material known as Nitinol and thus Wright Patterson Air Force Base and the US

92
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,500
Air Force contracted Battel to perform a material analysis on Nitinol in 1949 over 10 years

93
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,780
before its quote unquote official discovery in the private sector.

94
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,860
But this wouldn't be a UAP Grr video without the mention of the Atomic Energy Commission,

95
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
would it not?

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,020
Well this study by Battel into titanium base alloys was a research and development project

97
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,860
under the Atomic Energy Commission.

98
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,340
For those of you who have never watched one of my videos, UFO records and materials have

99
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,540
been classically misclassified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement under Trans-classified

100
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,520
Nuclear Foreign Material.

101
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,500
With this report, Battel's work on titanium alloys is one of very few studies without

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
classification.

103
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,660
It's not labeled as classified, unclassified, or declassified, but rather is labeled as

104
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
restricted.

105
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,700
Essentially, this is a private sector classification standard in which only need to know read-in

106
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,800
access is solely allowed.

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,020
If you've never heard of this before, people like David Grush have spoken that part of

108
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,620
the reason that private industries are used for UFO studies is because they have their

109
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,380
own legal classification standards that can't be breached by people with SAP access like

110
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Grush himself.

111
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:43,440
But even more perplexing, these studies into Nitinol were not declassified until 2010,

112
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,760
but we can go deeper because I have the most bizarre connection to make with Battel and

113
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,640
this Nitinol UFO material.

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,880
Within Battel Report 2, we observe an inconspicuous subsection titled, quote, Analytical Methods

115
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:07,040
for Titanium-Based Alloys by Juan A.C. Eckert and E.J. Center, a senior research chemical

116
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,480
engineer who worked for Battel from 1939 to 1957.

117
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
Looking out of the ordinary, right?

118
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,240
Center's section of the report deals with titanium purity.

119
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,520
Exceptionally pure titanium is needed to make Nitinol memory metal due to the high reactivity

120
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,840
as titanium, as I mentioned above.

121
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,880
So keep E.J. Center's name in mind, because let's travel to the summer of 1994 and read

122
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:39,000
into the Ohio UFO notebook by Dr. Irene Scott and the MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network Board

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
of Directors.

124
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,720
This piece titled, quote, The Ohio UFO Crash Connection and Other Stories, details an informant

125
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,040
who came to MUFON in 1992.

126
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,440
This man attended North High School in Columbus, Ohio in the late 1950s.

127
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,980
In 1958, he dated a girl named Kathy Center.

128
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,700
One night while visiting her home, her father, one Elroy John Center, told them while working

129
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,400
at Battel, and remember he left in 1957, he was, quote, responsible for a project which

130
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,440
required him to study parts retrieved from a flying saucer.

131
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,880
This section of E.J. Center is under one decoding the I-beam of the MUFON report.

132
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,580
Roswell enthusiasts will know that Major Jesse Marcell, who was taken by Rancher Mack Braswell

133
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:38,320
to the debris field, found an I-beam amongst the wreckage and memory metal, which had strange

134
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
characters on it resembling hieroglyphs.

135
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
What's crucial to remember here, guys, is that although MUFON reports on E.J. Center

136
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,360
and his work on flying saucers for Battel in 1994, E.J. Center's 1949 work on Knittenall

137
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,320
was not declassified until 2010.

138
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,420
So making this connection unless E.J. Center was really, in fact, working on materials

139
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,260
from a crashed disc for Battel, likely the Roswell wreckage, and blabbed about it once

140
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,180
he left Battel in 1958, would be impossible.

141
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,260
To put the cherry on top here, you JRE fans will remember famed computer scientist and

142
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,820
ufologist Jacques Vallée, appearing on JRE, the Joe Rogan podcast, on the 4th of December

143
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,960
2020, with the Phenomenon director James Fox.

144
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,120
If you haven't seen the Phenomenon by Fox, I highly recommend checking this out, as well

145
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,880
as Moment of Contact, which is about the Varginia Brazil UFO case.

146
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,880
He's got great documentaries, but anyways.

147
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,520
Jacques is famous for spending many years connecting the private sector to official

148
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,240
USG investigation, and within this podcast, he references one of the entities that helps

149
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,460
control the UFO phenomena, and the study of it in intelligence agencies is, quote,

150
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
a private contractor.

151
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,260
But Vallée nervously states he does not wish to disclose who, in fact, has UFO materials.

152
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,780
Fox comes to all of our rescue to suggest the name of the group indirectly by stating

153
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,700
its involvement with the 1953 Robertson panel.

154
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,340
As we studied above, this is Battel Memorial Institute.

155
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,040
I honestly don't know if I'm able to use JRE clips from Spotify for copyright inclusion,

156
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
so I'm not going to do that here.

157
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,760
But if you wish to check this out, this is JRE, episode 1574, and begin at about an hour

158
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,040
and 42 minutes in, where Jacques starts talking about pieces of metal recovered from UFOs.

159
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,440
And this is where the discussion about what private industry has these materials and where

160
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,120
Battel is suggested by Fox and Vallée himself.

161
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,380
And lastly, Battel actually has shocking connections to Arrow and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, our modern-day

162
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,300
disinformation agent.

163
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,140
Kirkpatrick and Arrow were directed to report to one Ronald Moultrie, the Undersecretary

164
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:10,300
of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and almost definitely one of the hostile witnesses

165
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,180
on David Grush's list.

166
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,000
If you'll remember from my Sean Kirkpatrick and Arrow video in 2022, Arrow and the DoD

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,880
awarded a company called Sandcorp, a contract of $1.9 million for Arrow support services.

168
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,480
This Sandcorp specializes in preventing leaks and stopping whistleblowers, okay, and guess

169
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,560
who oversaw this contract?

170
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,200
The Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security won Ronald Moultrie.

171
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,180
Additionally, on the 16th December 2022, Ronald Moultrie and Sean Kirkpatrick actually held

172
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,820
a public press conference that they have not seen evidence of crashed UFOs that suggest

173
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,620
they are craft from another planet or dimension.

174
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,060
They additionally suggest there have been no crash recoveries.

175
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,460
So here, alongside Kirkpatrick, we see that Ronald Moultrie is vested and interested in

176
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,220
playing down UAP and stopping whistleblowers, right?

177
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,440
Well, the honorable Ronald Moultrie is actually a board member of Battelle, and has been since

178
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,400
2016, and worse yet, Moultrie has tried to scrub this from his record, including taking

179
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,800
down his board membership from his LinkedIn page.

180
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,120
But fortunately, Pogo.com stated on its website that Moultrie had been an advisory board

181
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,760
member at Battelle, and fortunately grabbed screenshots before Moultrie took this down

182
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,640
as I'm showing on screen right now.

183
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,100
So even up to the modern day, Battelle has its hooks, sank in the USG, and is controlling

184
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,740
the UAP narrative.

185
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:49,900
So, Battelle, not only have they played their hand in investigating UFOs for the USG and

186
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,660
Air Force, but they've also aided in quelling public interest in UFOs by saying there's

187
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,460
nothing to them, and studying UFO material, such as Nitinol, which was likely recovered

188
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
from the Roswell crash.

189
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,200
Guys, if I can't stress this enough, the story of the EJ Center, in 1949, he worked

190
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,680
for Battelle, studying the Nickel Titanium alloys, and this was not declassified until

191
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,920
2010, but in 1994, the Ohio Muffin General reported on EJ Center, who said he worked

192
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,040
on parts of a flying saucer once he left Battelle in 58.

193
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,820
That connection is just obscene, and really adds another kernel of credibility to this

194
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,060
already baffling case with a ton of supporting evidence.

195
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,020
I hope you guys enjoyed this look into Battelle.

196
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,860
Battelle's hands are insanely dirty in UFOs.

197
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,860
So is Lockheed Martin, so is the Carlisle Group.

198
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,980
I will make videos about those as well, but I hope everybody learned something today.

199
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,380
For the people in the know, and I know I have a lot of fans who probably know a lot more

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,600
than I do in some aspects of UAP, there was a leaker online about eight months ago in

201
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:10,600
2023, I believe, who claimed he was a biologist at Battelle, working on EBOs, extraterrestrial

202
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,520
biological organisms, if I think it is.

203
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,680
He goes into the whole taxonomy of supposed aliens found and retrieved, crashed, and dead.

204
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
I decided not to include that just because, of course, there is a possibility that is

205
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,140
a LARP, and I don't have supporting evidence right now for those claims.

206
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,980
They are quite insane.

207
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,820
Maybe I'll do a video on that in the future too, but I know some of you guys are probably

208
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,780
thinking why didn't he include that, why didn't he talk about that.

209
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,460
But that's why, just because I can't put together a body of evidence and make a well-researched

210
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,660
thesis for that, quote unquote, whistleblower.

211
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,620
So maybe another time, give me 100 hours to look into that.

212
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,620
But I hope you guys are having a great week.

213
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I am sure not.

214
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,600
I'm sorry if I'm disheveled, I'm a huge UFC fan, and last night I had to watch my favorite

215
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,200
fighter in the world, Alexander Volkanovsky, get knocked out.

216
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,400
So I'm a little under the weather, so your guys' support means the most.

217
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Please remember to like and subscribe, and I will catch you guys on the next video.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,500
Thank you.
