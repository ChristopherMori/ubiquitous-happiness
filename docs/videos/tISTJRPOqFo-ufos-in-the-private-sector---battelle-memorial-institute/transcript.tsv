0	5880	Meet Battelle Memorial Institute, a private non-profit applied sciences and technology
5880	11600	development company whose mission is to, quote, deliver scientific discovery and applied
11600	15160	research that makes the world a better place to live.
15160	20560	This private non-profit has a prolific list of USG-contracted work, including classified
20560	21560	SAPs.
21560	26920	Battelle has a storied history in the technological development of our US society, including research
26920	32480	into the fabrication of uranium for the Manhattan Project from 39 to 52, development of the
32480	38600	photocopy machine and UPC barcode system, work on combustion, electronics, energy, conversion,
38600	44640	propellants, all for Apollo 11, and military research into biological and chemical weapons
44640	47040	slash defense systems and more.
47040	52880	Today, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at Los
52880	58320	Alamos National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, as well
58320	63720	as Oak Ridge National Lab, all of which are DOE-sponsored labs.
63720	68200	So we already see some ties here with Battelle and the USG UAP work in Los Alamos and the
68200	69200	DOE.
69200	74240	But what if I told you, Battelle is harboring a dark secret, that the company has a long
74240	81800	history of studying UFOs, aiding the USG and USAF in the UFO cover-up, and has even conducted
81800	84640	analysis on UFO material.
84640	89840	Hey guys, it is UAP Gerb and we are finally going to start to dive into one of the most
89840	94960	fascinating aspects of the UFO phenomena, the private sector's connection to the study
94960	95960	of UFOs.
95960	101200	Numerous key figures such as David Grush, Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Eric Davis, former
101200	106960	Senator Harry Reid, and more have made direct statements that USG defense contractors have
106960	112200	a direct hand in the reverse engineering and crash retrieval of UAP.
112200	118640	So today we are going to dive into one such company with real dirty hands on work of UFO
118640	123560	material and research, the Battelle Memorial Institute.
123560	129720	The earliest tracing of Battelle and UFOs goes to something called Project Stork.
129720	136000	In 1952, the director of the Central Intelligence received a memorandum titled Flying Saucers,
136000	140880	which detailed an arrangement between ATIC, the Air Force Technology Intelligence Committee,
140880	146120	and Battelle Memorial Institute for the contractor to establish a machine indexing system for
146120	149000	official reports of UFO sightings.
149000	156080	On the 9th of January, 1953, Battelle's Dr. Howard C. Cross proposes that the ongoing
156080	161160	Project Stork, quote, assists the Air Force in reassuring the public that everything
161160	165800	is well under control with respect to the UFO problem.
165800	170400	At the time, this memo was classified secret and even calls to attention Captain Edward
170400	175040	J. Ruppelt, the project's sign, grudge, and bluebook director.
175040	179600	I've talked about him in the history of the stigma, so check that video out if you haven't.
179600	184960	If you'll remember from that same video, in 1953, the Robertson Panel was conducted
184960	192440	to ensure that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status
192440	196240	and suggest the public there is no legitimate evidence of their existence.
196240	201080	While the Robertson Panel was conducted, Battelle had been commissioned around the same time
201080	207000	to separately analyze all Air Force UFO cases away from bluebook or these official panels
207000	208880	under codename STORK.
208880	212920	This project paralleled to bluebook and was even mentioned by J. Allen Heineck during
212920	216480	his attempted testimony at the Robertson Panel.
216480	220800	Thanks to the efforts of SUFON, the computer UFO network, I have been able to find all
220800	223800	seven Project STORK status reports.
223800	227440	That is another analysis for another day, however, all parts of course will be provided
227440	229560	in the video description.
229560	236720	On the 5th of May, 1955, Battelle and ATIC published a comprehensive analysis of 3,200
236720	239880	UFO sightings titled Special Report 14.
239880	245320	This report concluded that UFO are not aerial aircraft beyond human scientific knowledge
245320	250200	because no physical matter had ever been recorded from any UFO sighting.
250240	255480	But if we dig deeper, there is a massive contradiction here from Battelle's claim that no physical
255480	257480	matter had ever been recovered.
257480	263280	Six years earlier in 1949, Battelle had been contracted by none other than Wright-Patterson
263280	267600	Air Force Base to perform analysis on shape memory alloys.
267600	272280	See on screen now and in the video notes the first and second progress report covering the
272280	279760	period of September 1st to October 21st, 1949 on research and development of titanium alloys.
280480	289880	The bulk of these investigations focus on Nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy, a metal
289880	296800	that would not be officially discovered until 1961 by Dr. William J. Bueller.
296800	302920	So Battelle was performing analysis on the nickel-titanium shape metal alloy, now known
302920	307360	as Nitinol, over 10 years prior to its official discovery?
307360	310320	Well what exactly is Nitinol?
310320	314480	For you material scientists out there and I am not one of you, Nitinol has the unique
314480	318200	properties of super-elasticity and shape memory.
318200	322600	The metal can be subjected to high levels of stress and snap back to its original shape
322600	327080	when pressure is released, showing no deformation on the material.
327080	332440	Nitinol is also elastochloric where the material heats up when exposed to a mechanical force
332440	333440	field.
333440	337600	When this heat is released into the environment and the force field is removed, the material
337600	342240	super cools and extracts the same amount of heat from the environment again.
342240	347560	If I am not stressing this enough, Nitinol is a remarkable material that is exceedingly
347560	354440	difficult to manufacture due to the exceptionally high and tight compositional control required
354440	357340	and the tremendous reactivity of titanium.
357340	363360	The material is even used for thermal and electrical actuators, implants due to the
363360	367480	material's biocompatibility and structural dampening.
367480	373020	So again, Battelle was contracted to perform a material analysis on an alloy that is exceedingly
373020	380000	difficult to make, requiring vacuum arc remelting or vacuum induction remelting to manufacture
380000	387500	today in the 21st century, but had this material in the late 40s specifically 1949?
387500	392880	And does this alloy not sound almost exactly like the material that was discovered in the
392880	400720	1947 Roswell crash, that Jesse Marcell described as an exceedingly light metal that would retain
400720	402720	its shape after deformation?
402720	407480	And remember, Jesse Marcell was a military officer who was taken to the UFO crash debris
407480	412360	field with rancher Mac Brazel, who discovered these materials and then was later told by
412360	418780	General Rami to pose with balsa wood and aluminum foil to push the weather balloon theory and
418780	421380	all of this is in Marcell's own words.
421380	426780	More damming is that this debris from a UFO was supposedly shipped to none other than,
426780	429460	you guessed it, Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
429460	436100	So to summarize, I am directly inferring that the 1947 Roswell crash led to the discovery
436100	442080	of the material known as Nitinol and thus Wright Patterson Air Force Base and the US
442080	449500	Air Force contracted Battel to perform a material analysis on Nitinol in 1949 over 10 years
449500	453780	before its quote unquote official discovery in the private sector.
453780	458860	But this wouldn't be a UAP Grr video without the mention of the Atomic Energy Commission,
458860	459860	would it not?
459860	465020	Well this study by Battel into titanium base alloys was a research and development project
465020	467860	under the Atomic Energy Commission.
467860	472340	For those of you who have never watched one of my videos, UFO records and materials have
472340	479540	been classically misclassified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement under Trans-classified
479540	481520	Nuclear Foreign Material.
481520	486500	With this report, Battel's work on titanium alloys is one of very few studies without
486500	487500	classification.
487500	492660	It's not labeled as classified, unclassified, or declassified, but rather is labeled as
492660	493660	restricted.
493660	499700	Essentially, this is a private sector classification standard in which only need to know read-in
499700	501800	access is solely allowed.
501800	506020	If you've never heard of this before, people like David Grush have spoken that part of
506020	510620	the reason that private industries are used for UFO studies is because they have their
510620	515380	own legal classification standards that can't be breached by people with SAP access like
515380	516380	Grush himself.
516380	523440	But even more perplexing, these studies into Nitinol were not declassified until 2010,
523440	529760	but we can go deeper because I have the most bizarre connection to make with Battel and
529760	532640	this Nitinol UFO material.
532640	538880	Within Battel Report 2, we observe an inconspicuous subsection titled, quote, Analytical Methods
538880	547040	for Titanium-Based Alloys by Juan A.C. Eckert and E.J. Center, a senior research chemical
547040	552480	engineer who worked for Battel from 1939 to 1957.
552480	554640	Looking out of the ordinary, right?
554640	558240	Center's section of the report deals with titanium purity.
558240	563520	Exceptionally pure titanium is needed to make Nitinol memory metal due to the high reactivity
563520	565840	as titanium, as I mentioned above.
565840	571880	So keep E.J. Center's name in mind, because let's travel to the summer of 1994 and read
571880	579000	into the Ohio UFO notebook by Dr. Irene Scott and the MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network Board
579000	580600	of Directors.
580600	587720	This piece titled, quote, The Ohio UFO Crash Connection and Other Stories, details an informant
587720	591040	who came to MUFON in 1992.
591040	596440	This man attended North High School in Columbus, Ohio in the late 1950s.
596440	600980	In 1958, he dated a girl named Kathy Center.
600980	607700	One night while visiting her home, her father, one Elroy John Center, told them while working
607700	614400	at Battel, and remember he left in 1957, he was, quote, responsible for a project which
614400	619440	required him to study parts retrieved from a flying saucer.
619440	625880	This section of E.J. Center is under one decoding the I-beam of the MUFON report.
625880	631580	Roswell enthusiasts will know that Major Jesse Marcell, who was taken by Rancher Mack Braswell
631580	638320	to the debris field, found an I-beam amongst the wreckage and memory metal, which had strange
638320	641440	characters on it resembling hieroglyphs.
641440	646160	What's crucial to remember here, guys, is that although MUFON reports on E.J. Center
646160	653360	and his work on flying saucers for Battel in 1994, E.J. Center's 1949 work on Knittenall
653360	657320	was not declassified until 2010.
657320	662420	So making this connection unless E.J. Center was really, in fact, working on materials
662420	667260	from a crashed disc for Battel, likely the Roswell wreckage, and blabbed about it once
667260	671180	he left Battel in 1958, would be impossible.
671180	677260	To put the cherry on top here, you JRE fans will remember famed computer scientist and
677260	683820	ufologist Jacques Vallée, appearing on JRE, the Joe Rogan podcast, on the 4th of December
683820	687960	2020, with the Phenomenon director James Fox.
687960	692120	If you haven't seen the Phenomenon by Fox, I highly recommend checking this out, as well
692120	695880	as Moment of Contact, which is about the Varginia Brazil UFO case.
695880	698880	He's got great documentaries, but anyways.
698880	703520	Jacques is famous for spending many years connecting the private sector to official
703520	710240	USG investigation, and within this podcast, he references one of the entities that helps
710240	715460	control the UFO phenomena, and the study of it in intelligence agencies is, quote,
715460	717460	a private contractor.
717460	724260	But Vallée nervously states he does not wish to disclose who, in fact, has UFO materials.
724260	729780	Fox comes to all of our rescue to suggest the name of the group indirectly by stating
729780	734700	its involvement with the 1953 Robertson panel.
734700	739340	As we studied above, this is Battel Memorial Institute.
739340	745040	I honestly don't know if I'm able to use JRE clips from Spotify for copyright inclusion,
745040	746840	so I'm not going to do that here.
746840	752760	But if you wish to check this out, this is JRE, episode 1574, and begin at about an hour
752760	760040	and 42 minutes in, where Jacques starts talking about pieces of metal recovered from UFOs.
760040	764440	And this is where the discussion about what private industry has these materials and where
764440	768120	Battel is suggested by Fox and Vallée himself.
768120	775380	And lastly, Battel actually has shocking connections to Arrow and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, our modern-day
775380	777300	disinformation agent.
777300	783140	Kirkpatrick and Arrow were directed to report to one Ronald Moultrie, the Undersecretary
783140	790300	of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and almost definitely one of the hostile witnesses
790300	792180	on David Grush's list.
792180	798000	If you'll remember from my Sean Kirkpatrick and Arrow video in 2022, Arrow and the DoD
798000	804880	awarded a company called Sandcorp, a contract of $1.9 million for Arrow support services.
804880	809480	This Sandcorp specializes in preventing leaks and stopping whistleblowers, okay, and guess
809480	811560	who oversaw this contract?
811560	817200	The Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security won Ronald Moultrie.
817200	823180	Additionally, on the 16th December 2022, Ronald Moultrie and Sean Kirkpatrick actually held
823180	828820	a public press conference that they have not seen evidence of crashed UFOs that suggest
828820	831620	they are craft from another planet or dimension.
831620	835060	They additionally suggest there have been no crash recoveries.
835060	841460	So here, alongside Kirkpatrick, we see that Ronald Moultrie is vested and interested in
841460	845220	playing down UAP and stopping whistleblowers, right?
845400	851440	Well, the honorable Ronald Moultrie is actually a board member of Battelle, and has been since
851440	858400	2016, and worse yet, Moultrie has tried to scrub this from his record, including taking
858400	861800	down his board membership from his LinkedIn page.
861800	867120	But fortunately, Pogo.com stated on its website that Moultrie had been an advisory board
867120	871760	member at Battelle, and fortunately grabbed screenshots before Moultrie took this down
871760	873640	as I'm showing on screen right now.
873640	880100	So even up to the modern day, Battelle has its hooks, sank in the USG, and is controlling
880100	882740	the UAP narrative.
882740	889900	So, Battelle, not only have they played their hand in investigating UFOs for the USG and
889900	895660	Air Force, but they've also aided in quelling public interest in UFOs by saying there's
895660	902460	nothing to them, and studying UFO material, such as Nitinol, which was likely recovered
902480	904080	from the Roswell crash.
904080	911200	Guys, if I can't stress this enough, the story of the EJ Center, in 1949, he worked
911200	916680	for Battelle, studying the Nickel Titanium alloys, and this was not declassified until
916680	923920	2010, but in 1994, the Ohio Muffin General reported on EJ Center, who said he worked
923920	928040	on parts of a flying saucer once he left Battelle in 58.
928040	932820	That connection is just obscene, and really adds another kernel of credibility to this
932820	937060	already baffling case with a ton of supporting evidence.
937060	940020	I hope you guys enjoyed this look into Battelle.
940020	944860	Battelle's hands are insanely dirty in UFOs.
944860	946860	So is Lockheed Martin, so is the Carlisle Group.
946860	950980	I will make videos about those as well, but I hope everybody learned something today.
950980	955380	For the people in the know, and I know I have a lot of fans who probably know a lot more
955400	962600	than I do in some aspects of UAP, there was a leaker online about eight months ago in
962600	970600	2023, I believe, who claimed he was a biologist at Battelle, working on EBOs, extraterrestrial
970600	972520	biological organisms, if I think it is.
972520	977680	He goes into the whole taxonomy of supposed aliens found and retrieved, crashed, and dead.
977680	981600	I decided not to include that just because, of course, there is a possibility that is
981620	986140	a LARP, and I don't have supporting evidence right now for those claims.
986140	987980	They are quite insane.
987980	992820	Maybe I'll do a video on that in the future too, but I know some of you guys are probably
992820	995780	thinking why didn't he include that, why didn't he talk about that.
995780	1000460	But that's why, just because I can't put together a body of evidence and make a well-researched
1000460	1003660	thesis for that, quote unquote, whistleblower.
1003660	1007620	So maybe another time, give me 100 hours to look into that.
1007620	1009620	But I hope you guys are having a great week.
1009620	1010620	I am sure not.
1010640	1014600	I'm sorry if I'm disheveled, I'm a huge UFC fan, and last night I had to watch my favorite
1014600	1018200	fighter in the world, Alexander Volkanovsky, get knocked out.
1018200	1021400	So I'm a little under the weather, so your guys' support means the most.
1021400	1025000	Please remember to like and subscribe, and I will catch you guys on the next video.
1025000	1025500	Thank you.
