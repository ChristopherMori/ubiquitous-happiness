1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Until recently, UFOs have been seen as anomalous craft operating in deep space, near Earth orbit,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,360
within Earth's atmosphere, and occasionally, whether purposefully or due to a mysterious

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,480
crash, touching our planet's surface.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,120
But a fascinating aspect of the trans-medium capabilities of these craft has long been

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,560
forgotten.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,480
Until Commander David Fraver's sighting of the tic-tac, which seemingly communicated

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,600
with something churning under the water's surface, military footage showing UAP entering

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,840
or leaving Earth's waters, in the incredible efforts of Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,320
What's up guys, it's UAPGurb, and today I want to cover the history and some famous

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,520
historical sightings of one of the most overlooked aspects of the phenomenon, undersea UFOs,

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,600
or unidentified submerged objects.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
The idea UFOs are not only operating in our skies, but also the most unexplored regions

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,360
of our planet is both profound and somewhat disturbing.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,600
So let's not waste time, let's get right into it.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,400
Shockingly, the study of USOs is not a recent undertaking.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,800
In fact, we can head all the way back to the early days of Project Blue Book in 1951.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,280
USAF Major Dewey Fernet, Blue Book member, undertook one project interloper with the

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,360
aid of the US Navy.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,040
The goal of this project was to investigate both aerial and undersea UAP.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,400
Regardless of serving as a sitting Blue Book member, Fernet's operation interloper was

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,600
curiously an extra governmental investigation, meaning it was exempt from all Freedom of Information

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,440
Act requests.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,880
Whether this was directed by USG Elements or not, I'm not quite sure.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,360
However, in 1953, interloper briefed the CIA, but the project's findings never reached

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,440
Congress or the American people.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,760
Today, only three case files remain from Fernet's project, cases 26, 27, and 28.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,440
Case 26 covers US Navy Lieutenant George P. Williams, who alongside with his nine-man

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,720
crew in their Navy Fleet Logistics Air Wing plane, observed a trans-medium UFO depart

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,040
the ocean and traverse the skies between Kefalvik, Iceland, and Newfoundland.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,520
The object, initially mistaken for a ship, rose from beneath the clouds and approached

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,640
the Navy aircraft at a, quote, terrifying closing rate.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,720
The object hovered near the air wing's port site before disappearing at alarming speeds.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,280
The object was described as elliptical or cigar-shaped, measuring a minimum of 200 feet

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,920
with a red-orange glow along the periphery.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,320
The other two surviving cases do not fit our investigation today, but still check this out.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,600
Case 27 highlights the experience of a South African Airways constellation craft en route

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
from London to Johannesburg.

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,960
Near the Kenya border, the airplane crossed over the crater of a long-extinct volcano where

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,960
the pilots noticed a silvery disk stationed deep within the crater.

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,840
The disk took off at a high rate of speed straight up and out of sight of the craft.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,200
Next we can look at the 24th of April, 1952, where the Air Force Technical Intelligence

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,220
Center is written by AFOIN-XSG, regarding the possible connection of submarine contacts.

43
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,220
This letter addressed to one Colonel Dunn attaches nine reports of submarine contacts

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,260
with UFOs, specifically flying disks, with the assistance of ONI, the Office of Naval

45
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Intelligence.

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,860
Unfortunately, these reports are unavailable, but what is interesting are the Navy UFO sightings

47
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,260
listed in the 1950s.

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,260
This information is relayed in Timothy Goode's book, Need to Know, UFOs, the Military and

49
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,260
Intelligence.

50
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,340
This information is supplied by respected ufologist Leonard Stringfield, who I covered

51
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,820
in the Kingman Air of Zona Crash.

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,540
Stringfield was informed of thousands of ONI UAP reports from 1952 to 1956.

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,340
But I skipped over this mysterious sender of the nine reports, AFOIN-XSG.

54
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,100
AFOIN is the Air Force Office of Intelligence, and we can assume that this SG is a special

55
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
group.

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,860
Curiously, we can look back to Edward J. Ruppel, a man I have talked about extensively, who

57
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,460
served as director of Project Grudge and Blue Book.

58
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,820
Ruppel stated that AFOIN was conducting a more complete investigation of UFOs parallel

59
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,700
to Blue Book in the later uncovered Battelle's Project Stork.

60
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,900
Ruppel stated AFOIN's technical capabilities branch and collection control branch were specific

61
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,820
offices doing UFO related work.

62
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,220
Was this Air Force special group tasked with investigating the nine USO reports one of

63
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,180
the US government's real secret UFO investigation groups?

64
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,820
To me, it appears likely.

65
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,580
In 1979, Kufan, the computer UFO network, filed FOIA requests for information on the

66
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,660
mysterious special group.

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,380
All requests were denied under executive order, citing the national security need to maintain

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,780
classification.

69
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,740
The trail here in the 1950s goes much deeper as well.

70
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:24,100
In 1954, JANAP, the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication, published Directive 146C, where

71
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,740
both Airborne and Waterborne UFO were to be reported under service, communication instructions

72
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,180
for reporting vital intelligence sightings, and Merrant.

73
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,380
I'm guessing this means maritime intelligence.

74
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,100
This meant both civilians and pilots were prohibited from discussing officially reported

75
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
sightings.

76
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,940
As service and Merrant sightings were subject to the Communications Act of 1934 and espionage

77
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,740
laws, violators would receive a prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.

78
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,340
And if you've watched a single one of my videos, you probably know I talk often about

79
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,420
USAF Regulation 200-2.

80
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,940
So I expect everybody knows that by heart, but if you don't, this regulation restricted

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,980
all official UFO reporting to be sent to ATIC and not Blue Book.

82
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:17,940
Well, in that same year, 1954, January 23rd, to be precise, the US Navy issued OPNAV, the

83
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,500
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Directive 3820, which required UAP sightings referenced

84
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,620
as flying object reports, to be sent to the Director of ATIC, the Director of USAF Intelligence,

85
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,980
and the Director of Naval Intelligence.

86
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,180
This report, which we can find a copy of in Donald Keyho's book, The Flying Saucer

87
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,500
Conspiracy, directly cites JANAP-146C.

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:49,940
With the implementation of 1953's USAF Regulation 200-2, OPNAV Directive 3820, and JANAP-146C,

89
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,460
we enter the slow descent into the dark ages of UFO reporting, starting with explanations

90
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,740
of swamp gas and weather balloons.

91
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,820
So our paper trail here becomes relatively sparse, and we have to start to rely on claims

92
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,780
of USO studies and experiences.

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,260
We must travel all the way to 1985, where ufologist Jacques VallÃ©e claims in Forbidden

94
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Science Pacific Heights, a collection of his personal journals, that a source at NARCAP,

95
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,980
the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, told him that a large

96
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,540
collection of UFO and USO files were being stored at Norton Air Force Base.

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,300
Norton has historically been associated with UAP or NHI research, such as being named by

98
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,420
Stephen Greer and the disclosure project in his alleged briefing to Congress in 1996.

99
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,980
But let's move on to a really curious rabbit hole from 2017.

100
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,700
Of course, with an absence of official documentation, this story should be taken with some skepticism.

101
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,180
But let's tackle the claims by astronomer Mark Dantonio.

102
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,500
With Dantonio, president of FX Models, a company with naval contracts was taken for a ride

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,140
in a naval submarine as a thank you for his company's contract work.

104
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,460
While undersea, the sonar team picked up what they called a fast mover, traveling at several

105
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,780
hundred knots.

106
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,060
For reference, most submarines and torpedoes travel at roughly 40 knots.

107
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,780
The commanding officer told the sonar operator to, quote, log it and dog it, end quote, essentially

108
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,900
bury in the encounter.

109
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,100
And years later, Mark asked a senior naval figure about the fast mover program.

110
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,260
I bet you can all guess the response.

111
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,540
Sorry, Mark, I can't talk about that program.

112
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,060
These two Dantonio essentially confirmed the program's existence, especially since the

113
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,420
figure told Mark that USOs were common and that there was a program in place to classify

114
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,460
and log and determine the speed of them, but those reports go into a vault.

115
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,260
Of course, remember, this is all just alleged testimony, we have no way to prove this right

116
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,740
now.

117
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,480
But the year of 2022 is where chatter around USO became much louder and really made its

118
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,820
way into the public zeitgeist.

119
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,260
I'd like to take a look at the published notes of Oak Shannon, a figure I haven't mentioned

120
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,700
since the Wilson Davis memo video.

121
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,740
Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Department

122
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,260
of Energy Nuclear Physicists, confirmed the authenticity of the Wilson Davis memo, but

123
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
that's not our focus for today.

124
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,860
These notes, published in 2022, recall Oak's time at the Advanced Theoretical Working Group,

125
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,660
held at BDM's International's McLean Secure Facility, and classified using DOE controls

126
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,460
in 1985.

127
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,340
These notes contain some fascinating information and I highly recommend reading them.

128
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,620
You already know, just check the show notes.

129
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,620
But alongside mention of some UFO hotspots such as Mount Hayes, Alaska, Shannon jots

130
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,780
down the Navy has intelligence on an underwater UFO hotspot near Gulfo San Matisse off the

131
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,700
coast of Argentina.

132
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,320
And we can also look at ex-CIA operative John Ramirez, the man who made the Galactic Federations

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,700
claims famous, who in 2022 claimed he had heard rumors of a relationship between the

134
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,980
Office of Naval Research and the CIA Office of Scientific and Weapons Research slash WINPAC,

135
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,500
the Weapons Intelligence Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center, where USO materials

136
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,900
are recovered and transferred to the CIA.

137
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Interesting connections here, seen as there are some insane CIA UAP rabbit holes, but I

138
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:34,980
want to save this for a more focused video on the topic.

139
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,740
And now we get to absolutely the most credible figure to speak on USO, who featured on Sol's

140
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:48,260
November 2023 panel, Timothy Galladette, retired US Navy Rear Admiral, former assistant secretary

141
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,140
of commerce for oceans and atmosphere within the US Department of Commerce, and former

142
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,340
administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

143
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,060
Here I am an ocean scientist for three and a half decades, and I sit in a lot of meetings

144
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,220
with leading ocean scientists still today, but it just it kind of mystifies me that more

145
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,300
people are intellectually curious about what the story of the century is, and that's these,

146
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,540
these that are occurring in the water.

147
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,300
On a fascinating news nation interview with Ross Coltart, Galladette has made some profound

148
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
statements such as,

149
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,580
We're being visited by non-human intelligence with technology we really don't understand,

150
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,660
and with intentions we don't understand it all either.

151
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,860
Now that really has surprised me to hear that from a former very high ranking flag officer

152
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,100
in the US Navy to actually say you're stating categorically that you believe NHI, non-human

153
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,580
intelligence, are real.

154
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Absolutely.

155
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,580
I think it's about time that we do disclose that we, we are in contact with non-human intelligence.

156
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,380
There is so much of interest I want to cover on the Rear Admiral, such as his Sol Foundation

157
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,960
discussion surrounding viewing the gimbal and go fast videos, but having them mysteriously

158
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,220
removed from his inbox.

159
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,000
Or how in his recent tweet, Galladette comments on the Sol Cal anomaly, possibly USO related

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,020
being scrubbed from Google Earth.

161
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,700
But let's focus now on his 2024 Sol published white paper, Beneath the Surface.

162
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,520
We may learn more about UAP by looking in the ocean.

163
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,620
This excellent paper was written by Galladette, and besides highlighting the obvious threat

164
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,640
to maritime security, the paper frames the importance of USO's study as an unprecedented

165
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,820
opportunity for maritime science and the subject should be elevated to national research priorities.

166
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:43,940
Galladette calls for action to uncover the unknown unknowns associated with UAP and USO's

167
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,500
due to the concerning non-reaction of the DOD regarding unidentified objects with unexplainable

168
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,620
characteristics entering US water space.

169
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,900
In the executive summary of the piece, the Rear Admiral makes a beautiful statement quote.

170
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:04,280
Yet, however concerning the security implications of UAP are, the scientific ramifications are

171
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:10,800
nothing short of world changing, pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,720
have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air sea interface in ways

173
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,720
not possible for anything made by humans.

174
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,960
And several pieces of congressional legislation support these observations by defining UAP

175
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,360
as trans-medium vehicles.

176
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,420
The stunning implication is that engineering, material science, and physics beyond the state

177
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,300
of the art are needed to produce and operate these objects.

178
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,460
This knowledge could transform such fields as air and maritime transportation, energy

179
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:48,180
generation, agriculture, communication, computing, manufacturing, space travel, virtually every

180
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,660
imaginable economic sector, not to mention defense.

181
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,720
Another study of UAP may lead to discoveries that make those of the scientific revolution

182
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,120
in the 17th and 18th centuries look like baby steps.

183
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,760
Throughout this paper, Gallaudet draws attention to the massive disparity between investigating

184
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,140
UAP operating in our skies and UAP operating within our oceans.

185
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,200
This is especially highlighted in the abysmal Aero Historical Report Volume 1, which makes

186
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,820
a grand total of zero references to any cases or whistleblowers having to do with USO or

187
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,020
maritime situations.

188
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,460
As I mentioned in the opening statement of this video, and this is really cool to see,

189
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:37,140
Gallaudet mentioned the Tic Tac case as observed in 2004 by the Navy FA-18F Super Hornets where

190
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:43,100
the pilots observed the UAP hovering just above roiling ocean whitewater, possibly indicating

191
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,580
a larger UAP below the surface.

192
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:52,120
Other cases highlighted in this paper include the Trans-Medium UAP, filmed in 2013 in Aguadilla,

193
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,640
Puerto Rico, captured by US Customs and Border Protection Thermal Imaging Systems.

194
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,400
Quote, over three minutes the object appeared to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 mph.

195
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,160
Enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum

196
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,920
underwater velocity of 95 mph, and at one point split into two parts before entering

197
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,460
the water again.

198
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,980
The SCU authorities concluded that no known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile, or human

199
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,140
made technology possesses these characteristics or capabilities.

200
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,900
Gallaudet also draws from a body of literature to state that USO and Trans-Medium UAP are

201
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,620
just as diverse as those spotted traversing the skies, quote, luminous orbs, silver and

202
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,380
gray discs, and triangular and cigar shaped objects with various lighting conditions.

203
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,520
First lighted craft are often seen under the sea surface without ever emerging, end quote.

204
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,040
The paper also touches on a fascinating case I have never heard of that occurred off the

205
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,760
coast of Shelburne Harbor, Nova Scotia in 1960, and no this isn't Shag Harbor in 1967,

206
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,200
however the two are located extremely close.

207
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,360
This case covers the encounters of several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated

208
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,420
in a US Canadian joint minesweeping exercise where the divers claimed to have observed

209
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,980
two disc shaped craft on the seabed.

210
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,380
Not only did the divers say they observed occupants attempting to repair one of the craft, but

211
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,580
also recorded footage of the event.

212
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,660
Wisely, Gallaudet thought this story pretty nonsensical or unbelievable until recent US

213
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,100
military whistleblower revelations.

214
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,940
I really recommend reading this whole paper, just check the show notes.

215
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,160
The Rear Admiral wrote an excellent piece that deserves attention.

216
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,920
After covering the sole paper, I would like to discuss just a handful of fascinating military

217
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,280
USO cases that have caught my eye throughout history.

218
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,680
In the same year of 2022, Lou Elizondo discussed a fascinating military USO encounter while

219
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,440
being interviewed by astronaut Terry Virts.

220
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Check this out.

221
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,620
I'll tell you, some of this stuff was absolutely riveting.

222
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:16,740
Let's talk about the stuff, I'll share with you one interesting event that occurred.

223
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
It's pretty incredible.

224
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,980
You have, I'm not going to go into too much detail, I want people to know who it is.

225
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,820
The person is kind of very cagey about this, but you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean

226
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,320
island on a regular basis because the Navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile

227
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
technology and whatnot.

228
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
What will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it falls into the

229
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,680
splashes into the ocean, it will sink and then at a certain time it rises up and we

230
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,840
go and fetch it.

231
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,240
We analyze it for telemetry and things like that.

232
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,800
Long story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things as they are

233
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,780
recovering it the first time, the missile, they're pulling up and something, what was

234
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:09,900
described round and circular about the size of a small island, black, dark color starts

235
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,220
rising to the surface.

236
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,420
It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface.

237
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,020
They thought, wow, that's really, really peculiar.

238
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,500
Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this, another missile that

239
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
was test fired.

240
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,160
This time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile

241
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
and this thing starts coming out of the water again and if you know about the Puerto Rican

242
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,200
trench out there, you've talked about water that's 22,000 feet deep.

243
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
It's the second deepest part of the ocean.

244
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
The thing starts rising up and it's starting to come to the surface.

245
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640
The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope.

246
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
They're doing an emergency ascent.

247
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,420
It's absolutely panic at the disco, freaking out, what the hell is that, what's going on

248
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:03,300
and as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile under water and then disappears, never

249
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
to be seen again.

250
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,060
And David Fraver's Tic Tac Encounter isn't the only time the US Navy and military has

251
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,060
encountered these.

252
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,940
In 2010, USN Petty Officer John Bowman saw a Tic Tac shaped object from the flight deck

253
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,120
of the USS Carl Vinson off the coast of Haiti, quote, I was staring into the water from above

254
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,520
when a large fat white Tic Tac object, approximately 20 feet in length, suddenly appeared in my

255
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,920
view below me, moving right and darted into the depths as fast as it appeared.

256
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,280
I couldn't really comprehend what I saw.

257
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,880
It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, it's forward and rapidly collapsed

258
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,440
in on itself and disappeared and quote, Bowman reported this sighting to his supervising

259
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,980
officer but was not debriefed and not to file a report.

260
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,300
The officer told him that everybody sees weird things in the ocean.

261
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,780
Everybody knows the famous Tic Tac sighting seen from the USS Nimitz in 2004, but did

262
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,620
you know in 1991, the same vessel had a USO encounter?

263
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,380
Petty Officer Kevin Thomas claimed to have seen a quote, huge black triangle, end quote,

264
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,780
near one kilometer in length, lift out of the ocean and shoot vertically into the sky

265
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,000
when he was left on deck after the ship was ordered to darken and clear decks.

266
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,520
Thomas claimed to have witnessed no water dripping off the craft, nor sound made by

267
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,800
the craft.

268
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,840
The next day, men in civilian clothes appeared and interviewed Thomas on board the Nimitz

269
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,680
asking why he was outside and what he saw.

270
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,400
Thomas said not a peep due to fear of being disciplined.

271
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,560
This story needs to be approached with some skepticism because full transparency at the

272
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,780
moment, I am unable to uncover Thomas' service record.

273
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,140
And here I just wanted to cover a handful of these USO cases.

274
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,420
If for my next video, you guys would like to see me tackle solely a list of USO cases

275
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,460
officially reported throughout Blue Book and other channels, let me know.

276
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,180
I personally really want to make that video so if the interest is there, I will absolutely

277
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,460
tackle it.

278
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,480
And lastly guys, I just wanted to cover a series of very controversial images taken

279
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,680
in March of 1971 from the USS Trepang.

280
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:25,000
These images purport to show the vessels encounter with at least two forms of UAP slash USOs,

281
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,240
a triangle and cigar shaped craft.

282
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,520
Debate has circled endlessly since these photos first appeared, some arguing they are legitimate,

283
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,720
some arguing their hoaxes, and some arguing the images are real but depict engagement

284
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,020
with test barrage balloons.

285
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,740
And I do have to add there are some people who think all or some of these photos are

286
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,140
an example of Feta Morgana, a complex mirage appearing above the horizon.

287
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,180
The story goes these images first appeared in a French magazine called Top Secret.

288
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,700
The original scans of the images were sent to investigator Alex Mistretta.

289
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:05,420
Allegedly, the Trepang station between Iceland and Jan Mayen Island in March of 1971, led

290
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,720
by Admiral Dean Reynolds Sackett, happened upon the USOs by accident.

291
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,760
Officer John Clica initially spotted the objects with the onboard periscope.

292
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Some of these images seem to be harmless snapshots of the objects hovering, entering, or leaving

293
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,760
the water, while others appear to show the objects in distress, unknown if this was due

294
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,200
to engagement with the Trepang.

295
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,480
Well we can actually confirm that the USS Trepang was indeed in the Arctic at this time,

296
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,340
especially near Blue Nose Arctic Circle during November of 1971, and we can confirm this

297
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,620
was the only vessel in the region.

298
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,260
I cannot find any information on if attack submarines carry balloons for training exercises,

299
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,660
solely this joint USN CIA document on testing balloon launches from submarines that was

300
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,260
conducted in 1955, so this does cast doubt on the balloon training exercise theory for

301
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,300
me, especially due to the fact there are no live fire records by the submarine at this

302
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
time.

303
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,280
Investigator and Navy pilot Steve Murillo was able to speak to Admiral Sackett.

304
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,520
Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take multiple phone calls, but steered away from

305
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,320
the UFO question.

306
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,160
The Admiral stated he did not see anything unusual on board the Trepang, nor did anyone

307
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
else.

308
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,860
He only, quote, saw ice.

309
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,600
The alleged spotter from the periscope, John Clica, whose identity we can also confirm,

310
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,560
was also contacted.

311
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,020
He stated he found the investigation interesting, and did not know what the pictures represented.

312
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,100
So these two statements essentially kill the training range story for me.

313
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,740
We are left with likely a hoax or the real deal, but the Admiral and Clica either cannot

314
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,380
break security oaths or were unaware of these signatures.

315
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,380
Unfortunately, one of the best images of the lot shows signs of tampering, credit to Wim

316
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,700
Van Utrecht for this discovery.

317
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,440
To my knowledge, this is the only such example of photo tampering.

318
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,640
Though he is extremely skeptical on these images, I tend to agree with the thesis of

319
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,520
John Greenwald here, that this altered image does not discredit the validity of the other

320
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
images.

321
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,400
John states many publications will enhance photographs for print.

322
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,160
This is done to improve visual appeal, and since the original images does indeed differ

323
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,160
somewhat in aspect from the magazine image, I find this hypothesis to be pretty plausible.

324
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,620
So are these images of the triangle, cigar, and possibly an egg-shaped UAP interacting

325
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,460
with our oceans real or a hoax?

326
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,140
Personally, I'm undecided, I need to do more investigation into this case, but the

327
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,980
images are perplexing to say the least.

328
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,460
Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the history

329
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,460
and fascinating aspects of USO.

330
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:56,380
In my opinion, throughout history USO have been severely overlooked until 2022 and onward.

331
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,720
Thank you Timothy Gallaudet, one of the biggest inspirations for this video.

332
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,600
I find that I've never ever ever anywhere seen the history of USO study covered.

333
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,500
Now here at my channel, and probably many other channels too, we go in depth into Project

334
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,760
Blue Book, The Robertson Panel, The Condon Report, all of these aspects throughout history

335
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,680
of UFO being studied openly or secretly, but you never hear about USOs.

336
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,880
So I just really wanted to touch on this fascinating aspect of the phenomenon.

337
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:33,020
And if you guys want, I really want to make that kind of video on some famous and underrepresented

338
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
USO cases.

339
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,180
I want to pull directly from Blue Book and Grudge and Sine and look from there, find some

340
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
credible reports.

341
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,660
That's a video that really excites me.

342
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,420
So if you guys want to see that, let me know in the comments below.

343
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,420

345
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,680
And for those of you who are into the sport, how about that 300 card guys?

346
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,360
That Holloway Gachie finish was one of the most wild things I've ever seen.

347
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm happy my boy Yuri Prohaska got the win.

348
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,640
And choosing Jamal Hill aged like a gross cheese.

349
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,800
So that didn't end up too well.

350
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Hope him the best.

351
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
He's a great fighter.

352
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,160
But let me know what you guys think about this next video and some other video ideas

353
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,640
you guys want to see.

354
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,020
I'm recording this the day after the Kona Blue files came out.

355
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,100
So I will definitely be taking a look at those and reporting back to you guys.

356
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,020
So thank you so much and I'll catch everybody next time.
