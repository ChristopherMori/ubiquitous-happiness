0	6480	The United States most well-known UFO investigation panels, Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book,
6480	13320	ran from 1949 to 1969 and collected data on more than 13,000 UFO sightings.
13320	19560	Of this massive body of sightings, 258 cases reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small
19560	25360	percentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or transmedium objects.
25360	31480	Of course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out, 1952's OpNav Directive
31480	37760	3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence
37760	42080	Center, USAF Intelligence, and Director of Naval Intelligence.
42080	46320	So it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO.
46320	48640	But what about the cases we do have?
48640	52320	And what other cases that don't appear in Blue Book that span our history are worth
52320	53320	our time?
53680	59320	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout
59320	60520	history.
60520	66120	From Blue Book to the modern day to pre-World War I, let's analyze reported cases of unidentified
66120	67720	submerged objects.
67720	72640	And guys, today we will not just be sticking with the US, but analyzing global cases I
72640	75120	find worth studying.
75120	86000	As mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Blue Book cases, aka 258 reports, involved sea
86000	88040	sightings of UFOs.
88040	94280	And 13 of these reports can be classified as good, meeting merit standards for UFO reporting,
94280	100240	and a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and transmedium objects.
100240	104200	Found in the annals of Blue Book indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic
104200	108280	from the ship Marcala on August 4, 1950.
108280	114200	Shockingly, this case is listed by Blue Book as unidentified, and may in fact be my favorite
114200	116560	case I will discuss today.
116560	124080	At 10pm EDT, the shipmaster, chief mate, and third mate of the MV Marcala saw an unidentified
124080	128760	elliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest heading northeast.
128760	133520	Passing within 1,000 feet of the ship, the object hovered no more than 100 feet above
133520	139000	sea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph.
139000	145160	This object was described as ovular, cylindrically shaped and elliptical, like half an egg cut
145160	146680	lengthwise.
146680	152080	The object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white.
152080	156480	All three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it
156480	159000	passed closely over the ocean.
159000	161360	This event lasted roughly a minute.
161360	167280	We can also hop on board the SS city of Almaco, heading from Yokohama to LA just north of
167280	171320	the Hawaiian Islands on November 7, 1959.
171320	175440	Three witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water
175440	177760	from four miles north of the ship.
177760	182200	The light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface, and remember those three
182200	184360	flashes as they'll come up later.
184360	188680	The Almaco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered.
188680	193240	Blue Book labeled this case as a meteor, but while such a prosaic explanation might be
193240	197680	possible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water
197680	201360	for an extended time period warrants more investigation.
201360	205000	And if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate near the vicinity
205000	209920	of Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June 1960.
209920	216360	At 2334 local time, an Operation Range Vessel, co-named Whiskey, was retrieving the data cassette
216360	219440	from a missile test labeled 1802.
219440	223680	The small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette, illuminated by strobes
223680	226920	and monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above.
226920	231680	As the smaller boat got within three to five hundred yards of the strobe, the crew observed
231680	236800	a steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface
236800	239820	and roughly 25 degrees from their boat.
239820	244680	This light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break
244680	245840	over the light.
245840	251480	The event lasted for 10 seconds and was spotted by the RCA photographer, test observer, divers
251480	256360	of the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and co-pilot of the recovery plane.
256360	259280	Blue Book claimed this sighting was a flare, however.
259280	264080	It was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site.
264080	268600	And this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo
268600	274560	in my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data observed a massive
274560	278560	USO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile.
278560	283520	And speaking of rushed Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on
283520	286640	the 11th of January 1966.
286640	292360	Near 1,000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate Helmsman and bow lookout observed a cigar
292360	295000	shaped object approach their ship.
295000	299760	The cigar object glowed with an orange-yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and
299760	301960	a body with a duller glow.
301960	307360	The body had two lights on top and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet
307360	310820	long and 35 to 40 feet in length.
310820	316360	The object neared the starboard side of the ship from the horizon and then turned 180 degrees
316360	318800	to avoid going over the vessel.
318800	324200	It approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400 feet.
324200	327760	After hovering for 30 seconds, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again
327760	329660	changed directions.
329660	334680	This incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea.
334680	339060	The shipmaster believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search.
339060	344180	Blue Book identified this case as the Cosmos 33 satellite decay, however, this explanation
344180	349600	does not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes.
349600	354100	If you would like to read more on ship-based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF
354100	358100	on Maritime UFO and USO research in Blue Book.
358100	363060	This stat-rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Blue Book sightings
363060	366060	between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
366060	374300	Of the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific.
374300	379340	This data highlights while there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot,
379340	383620	UFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water.
388460	392340	Historically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports.
392340	397860	In fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive if not more than our own here in the United
397860	399220	States.
399220	404420	One day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not
404420	410180	the topic of our video today because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO
410180	413100	reports that are indeed worth investigating.
413100	419060	I will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO Secrets by Paul Stonehill
419060	424020	and Philip Mantle, however, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy
424020	427700	of note and can track down additional reporting on.
427700	432860	Many of these cases are just stories and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified
432860	437780	files like we do with Blue Book, so I will be doing my best to vet these cases.
437780	441580	Let's dive into a handful of the most interesting.
441580	447500	On October 7, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents
447500	448500	Sea.
448500	453180	Its radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles.
453180	457660	The Volga's Captain Tarantyn approached the bridge to see nine bright disks moving in
457660	459380	from the northeast.
459380	463860	The disks arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes.
463860	469740	During the encounter, ship comlinks malfunctioned, similar to the major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran
469740	471540	UFO incident.
471540	476140	After the disks depart, the ship comms and operations return to normal.
476140	481020	Raising concern in the Soviet Navy, fleet admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov, known
481020	486860	as the Likr, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic
486860	493940	scientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to JANAP-146C and OpNAP Directive 3820.
493940	500060	The directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. Asaza and signed
500060	503660	by Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr Novoitsev.
503660	508180	This case was not only discussed in Russia's USO Secrets, but also in Jacques Valais'
508180	514820	book UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union, a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30.
514820	518700	The link to the book, free of course, will be in the video description, so check that
518700	520060	out for yourself.
520060	523940	Kamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia.
523940	530380	The almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Akhatsk from the Pacific Ocean.
530380	535140	According to Russia's USO Secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin
535140	541660	Solomchakov, on a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting
541660	544900	research within a motorboat on Kamchatka Lake.
544900	550020	Suddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of
550020	556460	the lake, in which rose a grey-colored oval object, estimated to be 40 to 60 meters in
556460	557820	length.
557820	562900	The object rose to an altitude of nearly 100 meters and hovered motionlessly.
562900	569020	As it did, the motorboat engine stalled, horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated
569020	573100	away rapidly, restoring functions to their engine.
573100	577780	What fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we
577780	583260	see Kevin Knuth discuss at the Sol Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from
583260	585180	vehicles.
585180	589900	In the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I
589900	591260	have heard.
591260	596500	This information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Ziggle, one of Russia's
596500	599060	most well-respected ufologists.
599060	606340	On June 15, 77, the Soviet ship Novolkuznetsk navigated the Gulf of Gayaquil, Ecuador,
606340	612260	a radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent
612260	614260	sphere rose from the water.
614260	619420	It flew around the ship, hovered 20 meters over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged, and
619420	621460	dove back into the water.
621460	624540	And with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
624540	630180	I'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on USOs from 2006,
630180	633780	where we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon.
633780	637380	I highly recommend checking out this whole documentary, and of course the link will be
663780	669180	in the description.
669180	675020	But one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO slash USO government documentation is
675020	676420	Australia.
676420	683220	The Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers, and files on anomalous
683220	684220	sightings.
684220	689860	In fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported, UAS Unusual
689860	696580	Aerial Sighting, occurred on January 23rd, 1964, and describes, quote, seen at sea by
696580	701180	crew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia.
701180	707940	Large lights and water made compass go haywire, shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise,
707940	710620	causing lights to pulsate, end quote.
710620	716780	The tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO-USO encounters
716780	719140	and certainly not missed by Australia.
719140	724660	A report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting.
724660	729820	Around this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings
729820	731060	seriously.
731060	736080	See these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included
736080	742100	alongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman
742100	747060	observing a light shoot up from the water, hover, and disappear.
747060	750820	Australian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters very
750820	757100	similar to both the fisherman encounter and our 1977 Soviet encounter.
757100	763100	This 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and
763100	769380	local Aussies observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height, curve
769380	771700	and return to the oceans.
771700	776740	Many of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes once returned to sea.
776740	780900	We're back to our SS City of Almaco case in Project Blue Book.
780900	786540	It is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized
786540	791980	these could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams, however this
791980	797340	does not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and
797340	799180	Americans.
799180	803140	Outside of the Australian government, the citizens of the land down under have some fascinating
803140	805860	stories of USOs.
806860	811220	shooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers.
811220	818420	In 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederick Walter and Emma Flavel observed five gray oblong
818420	824080	objects, rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast.
824080	829420	This sighting was also observed by two railroad workers who described five white or light
829420	835260	pink egg shaped objects, rise from the sea but with the added detail of quivering, similar
835260	838860	to our MV Marcolla case mentioned earlier in the video.
838860	844820	Cigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history.
844820	849260	Around the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a
849260	856700	case that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review, 1966-67.
856700	862680	Private pilot C. Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing four or five
862680	867120	mysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island.
867120	872320	Approaching the objects from the sky, there appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow
872320	876440	and up to 100 feet long accompanied by three smaller objects.
876440	880600	The two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the
880600	883040	aircraft approached within two miles.
883040	887640	Initially thought to be whales or submarines, the men in independent sightings from nearby
887640	894080	Seabrae Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost
894080	896680	like they did not interact with the water.
896680	902240	This interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the HMNZS Southland case Knuth describes
902240	909920	at the Seoul Foundation, which oddly enough occurred near New Zealand.
909920	915200	We all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he
915320	921000	and his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle
921000	923400	of the ocean in the middle of the night.
923400	928120	But I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case.
928120	932080	What I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th
932080	937000	century that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau.
937000	943280	On November 12, 1887, Captain R.F. Moore of the English steamer the SS Siberian encountered
943280	947320	a USO 10 nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland.
947320	950440	The captain observed an enormous fireball.
950440	954960	Rise from the sea to 50 feet, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky.
954960	959920	At the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and
959920	963640	most difficult to explain electrical phenomena.
963640	969200	But as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea.
969200	974600	In Africa, the Gulf of Guinea 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed
974600	978040	an immense object sinking into the ocean.
978040	983880	The cigar shaped object measured nearly 200 meters long and 300 meters wide.
983880	988040	As the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights
988040	992120	lit at the front and two blue-green lights shining at the other end.
992120	995320	This case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine.
995320	999600	However, seen as popular submarines at this time such as the early German U-boat measured
999600	1008040	solely 41 meters long, I still find this case anomalous.
1008040	1013320	And now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel.
1013320	1019120	Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon
1019120	1022480	observed by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere.
1022480	1025800	And it's worthy to note, this just wasn't an isolated incident.
1025800	1030880	In fact, the Maritime Light Wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned
1030880	1031880	earlier.
1031880	1038400	We had information that in the ocean, in the seas, in our inner seas,
1038400	1045880	there were cases of some kind of strange phenomena related to the light of water.
1045880	1050680	October of 1969, the Arabian Sea.
1050680	1054640	The command of the Soviet scientific vessel Vladimir Vorobyev unexpectedly woke up
1054640	1056360	without any sign of fear.
1056360	1061600	The instruments showed that the massive object was at a depth of 20 meters.
1061680	1064520	It was still one and a half hundred meters long.
1064520	1066520	They ran to the deck.
1066520	1070120	No, this is not a submarine, as we thought at first.
1070120	1073680	In the depths of the sea, against the clock arrow, slightly bent,
1073680	1077680	there were eight bright rays of the length of 200 meters.
1077680	1080400	The fiery continued for more than half an hour.
1080400	1084400	Then the spot fell apart into several parts and disappeared.
1092400	1095600	Two years before that, the source of light was able to be seen.
1095600	1098600	It was in 1967, in the Samzalivi.
1098600	1102600	The sailors of several Dutch ships then observed the rotation of huge
1102600	1104600	glowing wheels on the water.
1104600	1107600	And from the Glenfolle hot spring, it was clearly seen that the object
1107600	1111600	that was shining on the water was 20-30 meters in diameter.
1111600	1113600	What was it?
1113600	1115600	The question remained unanswered.
1116600	1120600	In the sea, many times, there were glowing wheels
1120600	1124600	that our famous construction engineer, Krylov, called
1124600	1127600	underwater ghosts.
1127600	1131600	The size of the wheels is sometimes huge, up to several kilometers.
1131600	1134600	And many times, they can be seen even from space.
1134600	1137600	They are rarely moved, and quite quickly.
1137600	1140600	The brightness of the glow on the surface of the sea is such that
1140600	1143600	the glare is sometimes visible on the clouds.
1143600	1146600	What is it? Without the glow of microorganisms?
1146600	1149600	But how to explain the amazing symmetry
1149600	1152600	and the huge speed of rotation of the light wheels?
1152600	1154600	Sometimes the clouds slip on the surface of the sea
1154600	1156600	with the speed of a racing car.
1156600	1159600	Microorganisms cannot move so quickly.
1159600	1162600	Moreover, the test of water from the wheels often shows
1162600	1165600	that there are no even traces of the glowing plankton.
1173600	1176600	The light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by
1176600	1179600	spokes of brilliant white light.
1179600	1182600	That can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air,
1182600	1185600	serving as a possibly trans-medium craft.
1185600	1188600	I must note, also as they talked about in the video,
1188600	1191600	some attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction
1191600	1194600	between bioluminescent algae and pressure waves
1194600	1197600	in an otherwise calm water. However,
1197600	1200600	I do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus
1200600	1203600	on the existence. But let's review the earliest sightings
1203600	1206600	of these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many,
1206600	1209600	many more sightings of the maritime light wheel
1209600	1212600	that have been observed, but I just want to recount a few of the earliest.
1212600	1215600	On March 27th, 1873,
1215600	1218600	the ship Adelheid voyage from Leban to Singapore.
1218600	1221600	Captain Ledman noticed a peculiar, blinding,
1221600	1224600	milky white light. Appear beneath the waves
1224600	1227600	about two ship lengths from the vessel.
1227600	1230600	Flakes of light described as, quote, flakes of snow
1230600	1233600	when driven over the rocks by a strong wind, end quote.
1233600	1236600	The light followed the ship traveling at four to five knots
1236600	1239600	for roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing.
1239600	1242600	Ledman stated he had not seen anything like this
1242600	1245600	in his 26 years of maritime life.
1245600	1248600	We can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia,
1248600	1251600	mentioned in an 1873 news article in the Argus.
1251600	1254600	An almost USO flap
1254600	1257600	was experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901.
1257600	1260600	An initial USO sighting
1260600	1263600	was reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans,
1263600	1266600	a hydrographer for the British Navy on May 15th, 1879.
1266600	1269600	J. E. Pringle of the HMS Vulture
1269600	1272600	reported, quote, luminous waves
1272600	1275600	or pulsations in the water,
1275600	1278600	moving at great speed, end quote, passing under the vulture.
1278600	1281600	It was at this time Pringle noticed two objects
1281600	1284600	in the east and west, what appeared to be, quote,
1284600	1287600	revolving wheels with a center on that bearing
1287600	1290600	and whose spokes were illuminated, end quote.
1290600	1293600	Worthy to note, these two wheels were rotating
1293600	1296600	in equal and opposite directions, and the spokes
1296600	1299600	were about 25 feet in length.
1299600	1302600	It is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water
1302600	1305600	as the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here.
1305600	1308600	The second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880
1308600	1311600	by British India Company steamer Patna.
1311600	1314600	Captain Avern, Mr. Manning Third Officer
1314600	1317600	and others observed two enormous luminous wheels
1317600	1320600	appear on each side of the ship near 11.30 p.m.
1320600	1323600	The wheels were, quote, whirling around,
1323600	1326600	the spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship.
1326600	1329600	The spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long
1329600	1332600	and resemble the birch rods of the Dame School.
1332600	1335600	Each wheel contained about 16 spokes,
1335600	1338600	and the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter.
1338600	1341600	The spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around, end quote.
1341600	1344600	The men described the appearance of the spokes
1344600	1347600	could almost be represented by standing in a boat
1347600	1350600	and flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally
1350600	1353600	along the surface of the water, round and round.
1353600	1356600	The final Persian encounter with this USO
1356600	1359600	was observed on April 4th, 1901,
1359600	1362600	where Captain Hosean of the steamship Kila encountered, quote,
1362600	1364600	Vash shafts of light suddenly appeared.
1364600	1367600	Shaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea,
1367600	1370600	but it was only a faint light and in about 15 minutes died out,
1370600	1373600	having appeared suddenly and having died out gradually.
1373600	1377600	These shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour.
1377600	1380600	From earlier the year of 1880, I just mentioned,
1380600	1384600	this wheel-like object was possibly seen off the Malabar coast of India
1384600	1388600	on January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan.
1388600	1391600	Ari Harris describes a clear night over calm waters,
1391600	1394600	stars shining bright and no moon present.
1394600	1397600	At roughly 10 p.m. Harris and the shift's third officer
1397600	1400600	noticed a milky white circle in the sky,
1400600	1404600	resembling, quote, the nebulae sometimes seen in the heavens.
1404600	1407600	Approaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel
1407600	1410600	to try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object
1410600	1412600	and its waves of light.
1412600	1414600	The last old example here I will cover
1414600	1416600	occurred on the 10th of June, 1909
1416600	1419600	and was actually featured in Scientific American,
1419600	1422600	issue 106-51, which relays
1422600	1424600	the Nautical Meteorological Annual
1424600	1427600	published by the Danish Meteorological Institute,
1427600	1430600	a report on a quote, singular phenomena.
1430600	1432600	While sailing through the Straits of Malacca,
1432600	1435600	Captain Gabe of the SS Bintang
1435600	1438600	observed a vast revolving wheel of light under the water,
1438600	1441600	quote, long arms issuing from a center
1441600	1444600	around which the whole system appeared to rotate, end quote.
1444600	1447600	Surfacing, this wheel was so vast,
1447600	1449600	that half of it could be seen at a time
1449600	1452600	with the center laying near the horizon,
1452600	1454600	the wheel was able to move forward
1454600	1456600	and vary in speed and rotation,
1456600	1459600	disappearing when the center was right under the vessel.
1459600	1461600	And like our last 1880 case,
1461600	1464600	these maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water.
1464600	1467600	In the same Danish Meteorological Institute,
1467600	1470600	there reports another instance in 1910,
1470600	1474600	where Captain Breyer of the Dutch steamship Valencien
1474600	1476600	was sailing in the South China Sea.
1476600	1479600	Here, the captain, first and second mate
1479600	1481600	and the first engineer all observed
1481600	1484600	an object hovering above the water, quote,
1484600	1488600	it looked like a horizontal wheel, rapidly turning.
1488600	1491600	My friends, thank you so much for watching today,
1491600	1494600	as we took a deeper dive into USOs throughout history.
1494600	1496600	Please excuse the rash guard I'm wearing,
1496600	1499600	I just got home from training, but phalanx if you're watching,
1499600	1501600	I'm always open for a sponsor.
1501600	1504600	But anyways guys, I got such a great reaction
1504600	1507600	from my first video on USO, I had to make a follow up
1507600	1510600	and show that it doesn't matter what time period we're in,
1510600	1512600	it doesn't matter what country we're in,
1512600	1515600	there are stories of unexplained things in the water.
1515600	1517600	As far as the maritime light wheel goes,
1517600	1521600	I'm pretty torn on that whether that is a craft object
1521600	1524600	or possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena.
1524600	1526600	I'll include in the video description
1526600	1529600	a kind of not really debunk but a paper,
1529600	1533600	kind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena,
1533600	1536600	but still, the fact that these are seen in the Persian Gulf,
1536600	1539600	in Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me,
1539600	1543600	but even more fascinating to me are Australian,
1543600	1546600	Blue Book, and Soviet Files.
1546600	1548600	All depicting very similar experiences,
1548600	1551600	tic-tac-shaped craft, slash cigars,
1551600	1554600	fireballs exiting the water,
1554600	1559600	fireballs exiting the water that are almost curious about the ship,
1559600	1562600	egg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists,
1563600	1568600	but we see multiple cases of these sort of lightballs
1568600	1570600	leaving the water dancing around
1570600	1573600	and shooting off into the sky or back into the water.
1573600	1575600	As far as the tic-tacs go,
1575600	1579600	we often see these things hovering slightly above water
1579600	1582600	and multiple cases saying they're quivering or gyrating
1582600	1584600	or slowly submerging under the water
1584600	1586600	but not affecting the water surface
1586600	1589600	similar to the case Kevin Knuth talks about.
1589600	1593600	So I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena
1593600	1594600	by looking in our oceans.
1594600	1597600	There's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about,
1597600	1600600	but couldn't really find reputable sources for,
1600600	1603600	such as some Chilean incidents
1603600	1605600	that supposedly in the military,
1605600	1608600	a fleet of saucers approached a craft.
1608600	1611600	But until then, we'll just keep digging in case files.
1611600	1616600	It's a shame that there's not a lot of information at Blue Book.
1616600	1620600	We can thank OPNAV3820 and JANAP146C for that,
1620600	1622600	but we'll work with what we're given.
1622600	1624600	If one day I can get in contact with George Knapp
1624600	1628600	and see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia
1628600	1632600	pertain to USO, I would very much like to do that.
1632600	1633600	But where I stand now,
1633600	1636600	USO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon.
1636600	1639600	The fact that these craft can operate in air
1639600	1641600	or under sea trans-medium objects
1641600	1644600	without really changing their flight characteristics
1644600	1646600	is insane to me.
1646600	1648600	So if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary,
1648600	1650600	it's actually really darn good.
1650600	1652600	I highly suggest watching it.
1652600	1656600	It does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USOs.
1656600	1659600	And of course, you can listen to someone talk in a Russian accent
1659600	1661600	for 45 minutes, so that's great.
1661600	1664600	As always, guys, thank you so much for watching.
1664600	1667600	I've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately,
1667600	1670600	with the Kingman video and getting retweeted by Ross.
1670600	1671600	So that's been great.
1671600	1672600	I love all of you guys.
1672600	1673600	Thanks so much for being here.
1673600	1675600	Remember to like and retweet.
1675600	1676600	Leave a comment on the video.
1676600	1677600	Let me know what you think.
1677600	1681600	Let me know what cases, crashes, whatever you want me to tackle next.
1681600	1683600	That has to do with the phenomenon, of course.
1683600	1684600	Nothing random.
1684600	1685600	So just let me know.
1685600	1687600	And again, thanks for being here, guys.
1687600	1688600	I'll catch you on the next video.
