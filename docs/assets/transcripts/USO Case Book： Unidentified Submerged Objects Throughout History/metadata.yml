description: >
  Documentary-style overview of Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs): historical “maritime
  lightwheels,” mid-20th-century merchant-ship encounters logged by Blue Book, and Soviet/Russian
  naval case files. Emphasizes transmedium behavior (seamless air-sea transitions), extreme
  underwater speeds without cavitation, bioluminescent effects, and radar/sonar anomalies. Includes
  notable merchant, military, and scientific witnesses across the Persian Gulf, South China Sea,
  Atlantic and Pacific, Barents Sea, and Australian waters.
