00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
The United States most well-known UFO investigation panels, Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book,

00:06.480 --> 00:13.320
ran from 1949 to 1969 and collected data on more than 13,000 UFO sightings.

00:13.320 --> 00:19.560
Of this massive body of sightings, 258 cases reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small

00:19.560 --> 00:25.360
percentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or transmedium objects.

00:25.360 --> 00:31.480
Of course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out, 1952's OpNav Directive

00:31.480 --> 00:37.760
3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence

00:37.760 --> 00:42.080
Center, USAF Intelligence, and Director of Naval Intelligence.

00:42.080 --> 00:46.320
So it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.640
But what about the cases we do have?

00:48.640 --> 00:52.320
And what other cases that don't appear in Blue Book that span our history are worth

00:52.320 --> 00:53.320
our time?

00:53.680 --> 00:59.320
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout

00:59.320 --> 01:00.520
history.

01:00.520 --> 01:06.120
From Blue Book to the modern day to pre-World War I, let's analyze reported cases of unidentified

01:06.120 --> 01:07.720
submerged objects.

01:07.720 --> 01:12.640
And guys, today we will not just be sticking with the US, but analyzing global cases I

01:12.640 --> 01:15.120
find worth studying.

01:15.120 --> 01:26.000
As mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Blue Book cases, aka 258 reports, involved sea

01:26.000 --> 01:28.040
sightings of UFOs.

01:28.040 --> 01:34.280
And 13 of these reports can be classified as good, meeting merit standards for UFO reporting,

01:34.280 --> 01:40.240
and a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and transmedium objects.

01:40.240 --> 01:44.200
Found in the annals of Blue Book indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic

01:44.200 --> 01:48.280
from the ship Marcala on August 4, 1950.

01:48.280 --> 01:54.200
Shockingly, this case is listed by Blue Book as unidentified, and may in fact be my favorite

01:54.200 --> 01:56.560
case I will discuss today.

01:56.560 --> 02:04.080
At 10pm EDT, the shipmaster, chief mate, and third mate of the MV Marcala saw an unidentified

02:04.080 --> 02:08.760
elliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest heading northeast.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.520
Passing within 1,000 feet of the ship, the object hovered no more than 100 feet above

02:13.520 --> 02:19.000
sea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.160
This object was described as ovular, cylindrically shaped and elliptical, like half an egg cut

02:25.160 --> 02:26.680
lengthwise.

02:26.680 --> 02:32.080
The object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.480
All three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it

02:36.480 --> 02:39.000
passed closely over the ocean.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.360
This event lasted roughly a minute.

02:41.360 --> 02:47.280
We can also hop on board the SS city of Almaco, heading from Yokohama to LA just north of

02:47.280 --> 02:51.320
the Hawaiian Islands on November 7, 1959.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.440
Three witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water

02:55.440 --> 02:57.760
from four miles north of the ship.

02:57.760 --> 03:02.200
The light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface, and remember those three

03:02.200 --> 03:04.360
flashes as they'll come up later.

03:04.360 --> 03:08.680
The Almaco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered.

03:08.680 --> 03:13.240
Blue Book labeled this case as a meteor, but while such a prosaic explanation might be

03:13.240 --> 03:17.680
possible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water

03:17.680 --> 03:21.360
for an extended time period warrants more investigation.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.000
And if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate near the vicinity

03:25.000 --> 03:29.920
of Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June 1960.

03:29.920 --> 03:36.360
At 2334 local time, an Operation Range Vessel, co-named Whiskey, was retrieving the data cassette

03:36.360 --> 03:39.440
from a missile test labeled 1802.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.680
The small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette, illuminated by strobes

03:43.680 --> 03:46.920
and monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above.

03:46.920 --> 03:51.680
As the smaller boat got within three to five hundred yards of the strobe, the crew observed

03:51.680 --> 03:56.800
a steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface

03:56.800 --> 03:59.820
and roughly 25 degrees from their boat.

03:59.820 --> 04:04.680
This light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break

04:04.680 --> 04:05.840
over the light.

04:05.840 --> 04:11.480
The event lasted for 10 seconds and was spotted by the RCA photographer, test observer, divers

04:11.480 --> 04:16.360
of the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and co-pilot of the recovery plane.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.280
Blue Book claimed this sighting was a flare, however.

04:19.280 --> 04:24.080
It was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.600
And this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo

04:28.600 --> 04:34.560
in my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data observed a massive

04:34.560 --> 04:38.560
USO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.520
And speaking of rushed Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on

04:43.520 --> 04:46.640
the 11th of January 1966.

04:46.640 --> 04:52.360
Near 1,000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate Helmsman and bow lookout observed a cigar

04:52.360 --> 04:55.000
shaped object approach their ship.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.760
The cigar object glowed with an orange-yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and

04:59.760 --> 05:01.960
a body with a duller glow.

05:01.960 --> 05:07.360
The body had two lights on top and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet

05:07.360 --> 05:10.820
long and 35 to 40 feet in length.

05:10.820 --> 05:16.360
The object neared the starboard side of the ship from the horizon and then turned 180 degrees

05:16.360 --> 05:18.800
to avoid going over the vessel.

05:18.800 --> 05:24.200
It approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400 feet.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.760
After hovering for 30 seconds, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again

05:27.760 --> 05:29.660
changed directions.

05:29.660 --> 05:34.680
This incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.060
The shipmaster believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search.

05:39.060 --> 05:44.180
Blue Book identified this case as the Cosmos 33 satellite decay, however, this explanation

05:44.180 --> 05:49.600
does not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.100
If you would like to read more on ship-based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF

05:54.100 --> 05:58.100
on Maritime UFO and USO research in Blue Book.

05:58.100 --> 06:03.060
This stat-rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Blue Book sightings

06:03.060 --> 06:06.060
between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

06:06.060 --> 06:14.300
Of the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific.

06:14.300 --> 06:19.340
This data highlights while there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot,

06:19.340 --> 06:23.620
UFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water.

06:28.460 --> 06:32.340
Historically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports.

06:32.340 --> 06:37.860
In fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive if not more than our own here in the United

06:37.860 --> 06:39.220
States.

06:39.220 --> 06:44.420
One day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not

06:44.420 --> 06:50.180
the topic of our video today because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO

06:50.180 --> 06:53.100
reports that are indeed worth investigating.

06:53.100 --> 06:59.060
I will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO Secrets by Paul Stonehill

06:59.060 --> 07:04.020
and Philip Mantle, however, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy

07:04.020 --> 07:07.700
of note and can track down additional reporting on.

07:07.700 --> 07:12.860
Many of these cases are just stories and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified

07:12.860 --> 07:17.780
files like we do with Blue Book, so I will be doing my best to vet these cases.

07:17.780 --> 07:21.580
Let's dive into a handful of the most interesting.

07:21.580 --> 07:27.500
On October 7, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
Sea.

07:28.500 --> 07:33.180
Its radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles.

07:33.180 --> 07:37.660
The Volga's Captain Tarantyn approached the bridge to see nine bright disks moving in

07:37.660 --> 07:39.380
from the northeast.

07:39.380 --> 07:43.860
The disks arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes.

07:43.860 --> 07:49.740
During the encounter, ship comlinks malfunctioned, similar to the major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran

07:49.740 --> 07:51.540
UFO incident.

07:51.540 --> 07:56.140
After the disks depart, the ship comms and operations return to normal.

07:56.140 --> 08:01.020
Raising concern in the Soviet Navy, fleet admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov, known

08:01.020 --> 08:06.860
as the Likr, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic

08:06.860 --> 08:13.940
scientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to JANAP-146C and OpNAP Directive 3820.

08:13.940 --> 08:20.060
The directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. Asaza and signed

08:20.060 --> 08:23.660
by Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr Novoitsev.

08:23.660 --> 08:28.180
This case was not only discussed in Russia's USO Secrets, but also in Jacques Valais'

08:28.180 --> 08:34.820
book UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union, a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30.

08:34.820 --> 08:38.700
The link to the book, free of course, will be in the video description, so check that

08:38.700 --> 08:40.060
out for yourself.

08:40.060 --> 08:43.940
Kamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia.

08:43.940 --> 08:50.380
The almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Akhatsk from the Pacific Ocean.

08:50.380 --> 08:55.140
According to Russia's USO Secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin

08:55.140 --> 09:01.660
Solomchakov, on a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting

09:01.660 --> 09:04.900
research within a motorboat on Kamchatka Lake.

09:04.900 --> 09:10.020
Suddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of

09:10.020 --> 09:16.460
the lake, in which rose a grey-colored oval object, estimated to be 40 to 60 meters in

09:16.460 --> 09:17.820
length.

09:17.820 --> 09:22.900
The object rose to an altitude of nearly 100 meters and hovered motionlessly.

09:22.900 --> 09:29.020
As it did, the motorboat engine stalled, horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated

09:29.020 --> 09:33.100
away rapidly, restoring functions to their engine.

09:33.100 --> 09:37.780
What fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we

09:37.780 --> 09:43.260
see Kevin Knuth discuss at the Sol Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from

09:43.260 --> 09:45.180
vehicles.

09:45.180 --> 09:49.900
In the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I

09:49.900 --> 09:51.260
have heard.

09:51.260 --> 09:56.500
This information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Ziggle, one of Russia's

09:56.500 --> 09:59.060
most well-respected ufologists.

09:59.060 --> 10:06.340
On June 15, 77, the Soviet ship Novolkuznetsk navigated the Gulf of Gayaquil, Ecuador,

10:06.340 --> 10:12.260
a radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent

10:12.260 --> 10:14.260
sphere rose from the water.

10:14.260 --> 10:19.420
It flew around the ship, hovered 20 meters over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged, and

10:19.420 --> 10:21.460
dove back into the water.

10:21.460 --> 10:24.540
And with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

10:24.540 --> 10:30.180
I'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on USOs from 2006,

10:30.180 --> 10:33.780
where we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon.

10:33.780 --> 10:37.380
I highly recommend checking out this whole documentary, and of course the link will be

11:03.780 --> 11:09.180
in the description.

11:09.180 --> 11:15.020
But one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO slash USO government documentation is

11:15.020 --> 11:16.420
Australia.

11:16.420 --> 11:23.220
The Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers, and files on anomalous

11:23.220 --> 11:24.220
sightings.

11:24.220 --> 11:29.860
In fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported, UAS Unusual

11:29.860 --> 11:36.580
Aerial Sighting, occurred on January 23rd, 1964, and describes, quote, seen at sea by

11:36.580 --> 11:41.180
crew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia.

11:41.180 --> 11:47.940
Large lights and water made compass go haywire, shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise,

11:47.940 --> 11:50.620
causing lights to pulsate, end quote.

11:50.620 --> 11:56.780
The tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO-USO encounters

11:56.780 --> 11:59.140
and certainly not missed by Australia.

11:59.140 --> 12:04.660
A report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting.

12:04.660 --> 12:09.820
Around this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings

12:09.820 --> 12:11.060
seriously.

12:11.060 --> 12:16.080
See these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included

12:16.080 --> 12:22.100
alongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman

12:22.100 --> 12:27.060
observing a light shoot up from the water, hover, and disappear.

12:27.060 --> 12:30.820
Australian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters very

12:30.820 --> 12:37.100
similar to both the fisherman encounter and our 1977 Soviet encounter.

12:37.100 --> 12:43.100
This 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and

12:43.100 --> 12:49.380
local Aussies observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height, curve

12:49.380 --> 12:51.700
and return to the oceans.

12:51.700 --> 12:56.740
Many of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes once returned to sea.

12:56.740 --> 13:00.900
We're back to our SS City of Almaco case in Project Blue Book.

13:00.900 --> 13:06.540
It is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized

13:06.540 --> 13:11.980
these could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams, however this

13:11.980 --> 13:17.340
does not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and

13:17.340 --> 13:19.180
Americans.

13:19.180 --> 13:23.140
Outside of the Australian government, the citizens of the land down under have some fascinating

13:23.140 --> 13:25.860
stories of USOs.

13:26.860 --> 13:31.220
shooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers.

13:31.220 --> 13:38.420
In 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederick Walter and Emma Flavel observed five gray oblong

13:38.420 --> 13:44.080
objects, rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast.

13:44.080 --> 13:49.420
This sighting was also observed by two railroad workers who described five white or light

13:49.420 --> 13:55.260
pink egg shaped objects, rise from the sea but with the added detail of quivering, similar

13:55.260 --> 13:58.860
to our MV Marcolla case mentioned earlier in the video.

13:58.860 --> 14:04.820
Cigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history.

14:04.820 --> 14:09.260
Around the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a

14:09.260 --> 14:16.700
case that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review, 1966-67.

14:16.700 --> 14:22.680
Private pilot C. Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing four or five

14:22.680 --> 14:27.120
mysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island.

14:27.120 --> 14:32.320
Approaching the objects from the sky, there appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow

14:32.320 --> 14:36.440
and up to 100 feet long accompanied by three smaller objects.

14:36.440 --> 14:40.600
The two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the

14:40.600 --> 14:43.040
aircraft approached within two miles.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.640
Initially thought to be whales or submarines, the men in independent sightings from nearby

14:47.640 --> 14:54.080
Seabrae Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost

14:54.080 --> 14:56.680
like they did not interact with the water.

14:56.680 --> 15:02.240
This interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the HMNZS Southland case Knuth describes

15:02.240 --> 15:09.920
at the Seoul Foundation, which oddly enough occurred near New Zealand.

15:09.920 --> 15:15.200
We all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he

15:15.320 --> 15:21.000
and his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle

15:21.000 --> 15:23.400
of the ocean in the middle of the night.

15:23.400 --> 15:28.120
But I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case.

15:28.120 --> 15:32.080
What I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th

15:32.080 --> 15:37.000
century that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.280
On November 12, 1887, Captain R.F. Moore of the English steamer the SS Siberian encountered

15:43.280 --> 15:47.320
a USO 10 nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.440
The captain observed an enormous fireball.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.960
Rise from the sea to 50 feet, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky.

15:54.960 --> 15:59.920
At the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and

15:59.920 --> 16:03.640
most difficult to explain electrical phenomena.

16:03.640 --> 16:09.200
But as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea.

16:09.200 --> 16:14.600
In Africa, the Gulf of Guinea 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed

16:14.600 --> 16:18.040
an immense object sinking into the ocean.

16:18.040 --> 16:23.880
The cigar shaped object measured nearly 200 meters long and 300 meters wide.

16:23.880 --> 16:28.040
As the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights

16:28.040 --> 16:32.120
lit at the front and two blue-green lights shining at the other end.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.320
This case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine.

16:35.320 --> 16:39.600
However, seen as popular submarines at this time such as the early German U-boat measured

16:39.600 --> 16:48.040
solely 41 meters long, I still find this case anomalous.

16:48.040 --> 16:53.320
And now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel.

16:53.320 --> 16:59.120
Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon

16:59.120 --> 17:02.480
observed by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.800
And it's worthy to note, this just wasn't an isolated incident.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.880
In fact, the Maritime Light Wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned

17:10.880 --> 17:11.880
earlier.

17:11.880 --> 17:18.400
We had information that in the ocean, in the seas, in our inner seas,

17:18.400 --> 17:25.880
there were cases of some kind of strange phenomena related to the light of water.

17:25.880 --> 17:30.680
October of 1969, the Arabian Sea.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.640
The command of the Soviet scientific vessel Vladimir Vorobyev unexpectedly woke up

17:34.640 --> 17:36.360
without any sign of fear.

17:36.360 --> 17:41.600
The instruments showed that the massive object was at a depth of 20 meters.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.520
It was still one and a half hundred meters long.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.520
They ran to the deck.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.120
No, this is not a submarine, as we thought at first.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.680
In the depths of the sea, against the clock arrow, slightly bent,

17:53.680 --> 17:57.680
there were eight bright rays of the length of 200 meters.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.400
The fiery continued for more than half an hour.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.400
Then the spot fell apart into several parts and disappeared.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.600
Two years before that, the source of light was able to be seen.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.600
It was in 1967, in the Samzalivi.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.600
The sailors of several Dutch ships then observed the rotation of huge

18:22.600 --> 18:24.600
glowing wheels on the water.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.600
And from the Glenfolle hot spring, it was clearly seen that the object

18:27.600 --> 18:31.600
that was shining on the water was 20-30 meters in diameter.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.600
What was it?

18:33.600 --> 18:35.600
The question remained unanswered.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.600
In the sea, many times, there were glowing wheels

18:40.600 --> 18:44.600
that our famous construction engineer, Krylov, called

18:44.600 --> 18:47.600
underwater ghosts.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.600
The size of the wheels is sometimes huge, up to several kilometers.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.600
And many times, they can be seen even from space.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
They are rarely moved, and quite quickly.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.600
The brightness of the glow on the surface of the sea is such that

19:00.600 --> 19:03.600
the glare is sometimes visible on the clouds.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.600
What is it? Without the glow of microorganisms?

19:06.600 --> 19:09.600
But how to explain the amazing symmetry

19:09.600 --> 19:12.600
and the huge speed of rotation of the light wheels?

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
Sometimes the clouds slip on the surface of the sea

19:14.600 --> 19:16.600
with the speed of a racing car.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
Microorganisms cannot move so quickly.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.600
Moreover, the test of water from the wheels often shows

19:22.600 --> 19:25.600
that there are no even traces of the glowing plankton.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.600
The light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by

19:36.600 --> 19:39.600
spokes of brilliant white light.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.600
That can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air,

19:42.600 --> 19:45.600
serving as a possibly trans-medium craft.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.600
I must note, also as they talked about in the video,

19:48.600 --> 19:51.600
some attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction

19:51.600 --> 19:54.600
between bioluminescent algae and pressure waves

19:54.600 --> 19:57.600
in an otherwise calm water. However,

19:57.600 --> 20:00.600
I do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus

20:00.600 --> 20:03.600
on the existence. But let's review the earliest sightings

20:03.600 --> 20:06.600
of these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many,

20:06.600 --> 20:09.600
many more sightings of the maritime light wheel

20:09.600 --> 20:12.600
that have been observed, but I just want to recount a few of the earliest.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
On March 27th, 1873,

20:15.600 --> 20:18.600
the ship Adelheid voyage from Leban to Singapore.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.600
Captain Ledman noticed a peculiar, blinding,

20:21.600 --> 20:24.600
milky white light. Appear beneath the waves

20:24.600 --> 20:27.600
about two ship lengths from the vessel.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.600
Flakes of light described as, quote, flakes of snow

20:30.600 --> 20:33.600
when driven over the rocks by a strong wind, end quote.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.600
The light followed the ship traveling at four to five knots

20:36.600 --> 20:39.600
for roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.600
Ledman stated he had not seen anything like this

20:42.600 --> 20:45.600
in his 26 years of maritime life.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.600
We can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia,

20:48.600 --> 20:51.600
mentioned in an 1873 news article in the Argus.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.600
An almost USO flap

20:54.600 --> 20:57.600
was experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.600
An initial USO sighting

21:00.600 --> 21:03.600
was reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans,

21:03.600 --> 21:06.600
a hydrographer for the British Navy on May 15th, 1879.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.600
J. E. Pringle of the HMS Vulture

21:09.600 --> 21:12.600
reported, quote, luminous waves

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
or pulsations in the water,

21:15.600 --> 21:18.600
moving at great speed, end quote, passing under the vulture.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.600
It was at this time Pringle noticed two objects

21:21.600 --> 21:24.600
in the east and west, what appeared to be, quote,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.600
revolving wheels with a center on that bearing

21:27.600 --> 21:30.600
and whose spokes were illuminated, end quote.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.600
Worthy to note, these two wheels were rotating

21:33.600 --> 21:36.600
in equal and opposite directions, and the spokes

21:36.600 --> 21:39.600
were about 25 feet in length.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.600
It is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water

21:42.600 --> 21:45.600
as the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
The second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880

21:48.600 --> 21:51.600
by British India Company steamer Patna.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.600
Captain Avern, Mr. Manning Third Officer

21:54.600 --> 21:57.600
and others observed two enormous luminous wheels

21:57.600 --> 22:00.600
appear on each side of the ship near 11.30 p.m.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.600
The wheels were, quote, whirling around,

22:03.600 --> 22:06.600
the spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.600
The spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
and resemble the birch rods of the Dame School.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.600
Each wheel contained about 16 spokes,

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
and the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.600
The spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around, end quote.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.600
The men described the appearance of the spokes

22:24.600 --> 22:27.600
could almost be represented by standing in a boat

22:27.600 --> 22:30.600
and flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally

22:30.600 --> 22:33.600
along the surface of the water, round and round.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.600
The final Persian encounter with this USO

22:36.600 --> 22:39.600
was observed on April 4th, 1901,

22:39.600 --> 22:42.600
where Captain Hosean of the steamship Kila encountered, quote,

22:42.600 --> 22:44.600
Vash shafts of light suddenly appeared.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.600
Shaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea,

22:47.600 --> 22:50.600
but it was only a faint light and in about 15 minutes died out,

22:50.600 --> 22:53.600
having appeared suddenly and having died out gradually.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.600
These shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.600
From earlier the year of 1880, I just mentioned,

23:00.600 --> 23:04.600
this wheel-like object was possibly seen off the Malabar coast of India

23:04.600 --> 23:08.600
on January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.600
Ari Harris describes a clear night over calm waters,

23:11.600 --> 23:14.600
stars shining bright and no moon present.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.600
At roughly 10 p.m. Harris and the shift's third officer

23:17.600 --> 23:20.600
noticed a milky white circle in the sky,

23:20.600 --> 23:24.600
resembling, quote, the nebulae sometimes seen in the heavens.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.600
Approaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel

23:27.600 --> 23:30.600
to try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
and its waves of light.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
The last old example here I will cover

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
occurred on the 10th of June, 1909

23:36.600 --> 23:39.600
and was actually featured in Scientific American,

23:39.600 --> 23:42.600
issue 106-51, which relays

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
the Nautical Meteorological Annual

23:44.600 --> 23:47.600
published by the Danish Meteorological Institute,

23:47.600 --> 23:50.600
a report on a quote, singular phenomena.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
While sailing through the Straits of Malacca,

23:52.600 --> 23:55.600
Captain Gabe of the SS Bintang

23:55.600 --> 23:58.600
observed a vast revolving wheel of light under the water,

23:58.600 --> 24:01.600
quote, long arms issuing from a center

24:01.600 --> 24:04.600
around which the whole system appeared to rotate, end quote.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.600
Surfacing, this wheel was so vast,

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
that half of it could be seen at a time

24:09.600 --> 24:12.600
with the center laying near the horizon,

24:12.600 --> 24:14.600
the wheel was able to move forward

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
and vary in speed and rotation,

24:16.600 --> 24:19.600
disappearing when the center was right under the vessel.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.600
And like our last 1880 case,

24:21.600 --> 24:24.600
these maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.600
In the same Danish Meteorological Institute,

24:27.600 --> 24:30.600
there reports another instance in 1910,

24:30.600 --> 24:34.600
where Captain Breyer of the Dutch steamship Valencien

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
was sailing in the South China Sea.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.600
Here, the captain, first and second mate

24:39.600 --> 24:41.600
and the first engineer all observed

24:41.600 --> 24:44.600
an object hovering above the water, quote,

24:44.600 --> 24:48.600
it looked like a horizontal wheel, rapidly turning.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.600
My friends, thank you so much for watching today,

24:51.600 --> 24:54.600
as we took a deeper dive into USOs throughout history.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.600
Please excuse the rash guard I'm wearing,

24:56.600 --> 24:59.600
I just got home from training, but phalanx if you're watching,

24:59.600 --> 25:01.600
I'm always open for a sponsor.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.600
But anyways guys, I got such a great reaction

25:04.600 --> 25:07.600
from my first video on USO, I had to make a follow up

25:07.600 --> 25:10.600
and show that it doesn't matter what time period we're in,

25:10.600 --> 25:12.600
it doesn't matter what country we're in,

25:12.600 --> 25:15.600
there are stories of unexplained things in the water.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
As far as the maritime light wheel goes,

25:17.600 --> 25:21.600
I'm pretty torn on that whether that is a craft object

25:21.600 --> 25:24.600
or possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
I'll include in the video description

25:26.600 --> 25:29.600
a kind of not really debunk but a paper,

25:29.600 --> 25:33.600
kind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena,

25:33.600 --> 25:36.600
but still, the fact that these are seen in the Persian Gulf,

25:36.600 --> 25:39.600
in Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me,

25:39.600 --> 25:43.600
but even more fascinating to me are Australian,

25:43.600 --> 25:46.600
Blue Book, and Soviet Files.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
All depicting very similar experiences,

25:48.600 --> 25:51.600
tic-tac-shaped craft, slash cigars,

25:51.600 --> 25:54.600
fireballs exiting the water,

25:54.600 --> 25:59.600
fireballs exiting the water that are almost curious about the ship,

25:59.600 --> 26:02.600
egg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists,

26:03.600 --> 26:08.600
but we see multiple cases of these sort of lightballs

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
leaving the water dancing around

26:10.600 --> 26:13.600
and shooting off into the sky or back into the water.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.600
As far as the tic-tacs go,

26:15.600 --> 26:19.600
we often see these things hovering slightly above water

26:19.600 --> 26:22.600
and multiple cases saying they're quivering or gyrating

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
or slowly submerging under the water

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
but not affecting the water surface

26:26.600 --> 26:29.600
similar to the case Kevin Knuth talks about.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.600
So I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
by looking in our oceans.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.600
There's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about,

26:37.600 --> 26:40.600
but couldn't really find reputable sources for,

26:40.600 --> 26:43.600
such as some Chilean incidents

26:43.600 --> 26:45.600
that supposedly in the military,

26:45.600 --> 26:48.600
a fleet of saucers approached a craft.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.600
But until then, we'll just keep digging in case files.

26:51.600 --> 26:56.600
It's a shame that there's not a lot of information at Blue Book.

26:56.600 --> 27:00.600
We can thank OPNAV3820 and JANAP146C for that,

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
but we'll work with what we're given.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
If one day I can get in contact with George Knapp

27:04.600 --> 27:08.600
and see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia

27:08.600 --> 27:12.600
pertain to USO, I would very much like to do that.

27:12.600 --> 27:13.600
But where I stand now,

27:13.600 --> 27:16.600
USO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.600
The fact that these craft can operate in air

27:19.600 --> 27:21.600
or under sea trans-medium objects

27:21.600 --> 27:24.600
without really changing their flight characteristics

27:24.600 --> 27:26.600
is insane to me.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.600
So if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary,

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
it's actually really darn good.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
I highly suggest watching it.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.600
It does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USOs.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.600
And of course, you can listen to someone talk in a Russian accent

27:39.600 --> 27:41.600
for 45 minutes, so that's great.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.600
As always, guys, thank you so much for watching.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.600
I've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately,

27:47.600 --> 27:50.600
with the Kingman video and getting retweeted by Ross.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.600
So that's been great.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.600
I love all of you guys.

Leave a comment on the video.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
Let me know what you think.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.600
Let me know what cases, crashes, whatever you want me to tackle next.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.600
That has to do with the phenomenon, of course.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
Nothing random.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
So just let me know.
