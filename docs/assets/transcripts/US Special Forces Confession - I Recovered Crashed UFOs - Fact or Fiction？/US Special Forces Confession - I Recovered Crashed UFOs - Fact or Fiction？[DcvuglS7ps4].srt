00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
In March of 2024, the Infographics show, a popular and excellent channel with custom animations

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,200
and fantastic storytelling posted a video titled, US Special Forces Confession, I Recovered Crash

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,920
UFOs. Although the channel has covered the UAP subject in the past, this entry stood out entirely.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,840
The video covers the testimony of an individual who encountered a crashed UAP while serving in

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,480
Vietnam. With engaging storytelling and mesmerizing animations, the Infographics team highlights how

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,120
this sighting saw the soldier read into covert UAP operations and details his work on the program.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,560
Astonishing details of UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering are highlighted in this

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,520
account very similar to the claims of David Grush. I'm sure many people saw this video,

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,440
enjoyed it, and moved on. Just as many watched it and thought, huh, I wonder if this is real.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
But the narrator starts this video with a statement that almost forces us to analyze the

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,720
entire video line by line. Note, the following is based on testimony provided over a series of

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,160
interviews and written correspondence, edited and cut together in an attempt to create a cohesive

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,000
timeline of the events as described. Do these events recount the experience of a real anonymous

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,240
whistleblower? Is this story rooted in fact, and are there elements we can verify? And why did he

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,240
speak to the Infographics show? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you for joining me as we conduct

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,480
a full breakdown and analysis of the Infographics show's US Special Forces Confession, I Recovered

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,640
UFOs. Since its release, I have played this testimony over and over and over in my head.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,760
Is it possible that these events and details recount the true testimony of someone on a UFO

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,360
crash retrieval program? I think it is well worth investigating their story. Searching for holes or

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,600
confirmable elements, because this could very well be the most crucial first-hand whistleblower of all time.

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,920
To start, our witness states, and I will be calling him our witness for the duration of this video,

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,480
that our story begins in 1968, during the Vietnam conflict along the Vietnam-Kimbodia border.

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Before we get into his story, we do have two interesting Vietnam cases that may be contextually

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,360
relevant to our Infographics whistleblower. We can check in on the ever-relevant Stephen

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,560
Greer redacted witness log to analyze the statements and emails of witness 10622.

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,880
10622 served as CTR Communication Technician Radio in the US Navy from 1966 to 1970,

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,880
on the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier. It was in June of 1968 on official duties,

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,880
he received scrambled messages mentioning at least 11 UAP were tracked on visual and radar.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,680
And on September 9, 1968, several US helicopter pilots and soldiers stationed at a Marine Corps

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,600
base in Dong Ha, Vietnam had a close encounter with a fast-moving object. This object had green

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,760
and white lights and engaged in maneuvers for 20 minutes. Anyways, our witness states his US military

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,440
unit was performing an LRRP, a long-range reconnaissance patrol tracking supply routes into

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,760
South Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as marking out sites for a B-52 bombing raid the following year.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,120
This tiny snippet in the video gives us so much to unpack. The following year of 1969,

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,760
a covert bombing raid did in fact occur. On March 18, 1969, the Strategic Air Command commenced

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,400
Operation Menu, not declassified until 2000 by President Bill Clinton. Operation Menu was a year

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,680
long B-52 bombing campaign that ravaged Eastern Cambodia, and that mention LRRP may be one of

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,120
the most significant pieces to solving this puzzle. Long-range reconnaissance patrol was a special

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
unit acting in Vietnam, Company E 52nd Infantry, attached to the 1st Calvary Division in the

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,200
US Army. This unit operated in Vietnam from 1967 to 1969, well within the time frame of our witness

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,840
and participated in two of the largest battles of Vietnam, the Tet Offensive and Siege of Que Son.

42
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,280
In late October of 1968, Company E 52nd Infantry was relocated and headquartered at Phuoc Vinh,

43
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,680
north of Vietnam. The division's area of operations was designated along the Cambodian border in

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,080
Tainin, Bin Long, and Phuoc Long provinces, all in South Vietnam. These areas contained

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,240
significant routes for enemy infiltration into the Saigon area from Cambodia. So if our witness

46
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,080
is telling the truth and this crash is real, this event occurred in October to December 1968 within

47
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,840
the Company E 52nd Infantry, LRRP, stationed out of Phuoc Vinh. So far, his testimony lines up exactly

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,000
with real events. And finally back to our story, a quote unquote object appeared overhead the witness

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,480
in his platoon, emitting a bright red orange glow appearing to be melting. The object quickly moved

50
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,240
out of sight, but only five or six seconds later, a large crash followed by a dull thump

51
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,600
reverberated throughout the jungle. The platoon figured this must have been a US plane, so knowing

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,800
better than to risk long range radio communications being intercepted by Soviet agents, they moved

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,320
to secure the crash site. Arriving at the site, the platoon knew immediately this was not a US

54
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,080
plane classified or acknowledged. The only prosaic explanation the soldiers could think of was a crash

55
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,880
base probe, something from NASA or the Soviets. The craft was egg shaped, dull gray and metallic,

56
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,680
and seemingly cracked open. Again we see the description this craft appeared to be made

57
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,560
from a single piece of metal with no bolts, seams, or screws. This sighting and craft description

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,240
give us a lot to work off of actually. What immediately stands out to me is this red orange

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,120
glow the craft emanated while flying over the jungle. There are two cases within our crashes

60
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,160
timeframe that are worth mentioning that are similar to this. We can look to November 22nd

61
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:19,360
of 1968 to NICAP case 681122. On this date in Albany, Georgia, a glowing yellow white oval UFO

62
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,360
was seen from a car, directed a light beam at the vehicle and flew away changing colors to red and

63
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,040
orange. And let's head to move France on December 15th 1968. Reported in a book translated as UFO,

64
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,240
the first complete file on close encounters in France. We can find a case where an egg shaped

65
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,680
object the size of a car moved quickly without making noise, emanating orange reflections.

66
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,560
But let's not forget an event that occurred just a year earlier on March 24th 1967 highlighted in

67
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,880
the sworn affidavits by Captain Robert Salas and others at Malmstrom Air Force Base. I covered this

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,160
case in my UFO and nukes video, but this event saw a red orange oval UAP appear over the base,

69
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,200
disabling the ICBMs of Malmstrom. And this mention of an egg shaped object comes up again and again

70
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,400
in ufology. We will talk about this more later in the video with the witnesses experience within

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,680
the program. But let's look at the testimony of aerospace contractor Eric Taper to Aero,

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,680
who recounted an egg shaped metallic UFO being kept at Area 51 in the 1980s. The description

73
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,280
of this craft is almost identical to the Vietnam encounter. And lastly, the molten feel of the

74
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,400
craft reminds me closely of the mother of pearl effect displayed on the skin of the craft Lance

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,360
Corporal Jonathan Waygant claimed to have observed in the jungles of Peru in 1997.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Our platoon of Marines called in the crash only to hear there were already birds in root and

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,120
ordered to secure the crash. Quickly, a pair of F4 jets fell into orbit overhead. The mention of

78
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,040
the McDonnell Douglas F4 Phantom II may seem small, but this is actually a huge detail in our

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,680
story. In June of 1986, former Betul Corps contractor James McCamble told ufology Jacques

80
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,000
Valais he met with a military contact with the wild weasels, a codename given by USAF for aircraft

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
equipped with anti radiation missiles and tasked with the suppression of enemy air defenses in

82
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,760
Vietnam. This contractor told McCamble F4 jets were equipped with EM detection equipment to detect

83
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,760
UAP during the war. Dr. Steven Greer may have an additional witness adding valuable context these

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,120
claims. Witness 10272 claims to have worked for a UK based contractor installing low observable

85
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,200
radar assemblies on F4 fighters at area 51. Along with these claims, the witness alleges to have

86
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,200
been involved in the evaluation of hardware from NHI craft. Anyways, infantry then touched down

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
and acted in perimeter security, but I want to note the witness states they were allowed nowhere

88
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,520
near the craft. They were deployed in a wide swath. It took two days for the craft to be removed from

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,200
the jungle, all with the help of SOF, Special Operations Forces, Navy and Air Force officials

90
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,400
on site who had already been read into the program. The mention of the Air Force is no surprise here.

91
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Ever since the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash and the involvement of USAF General Roger Raimi,

92
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
the Air Force has long been entwined with the study of UAP. Again, I would like to recommend

93
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:32,400
my Moondust video and USAF Document AFC-1E draft policy, which states Project UFO and Moondust,

94
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,720
both headquartered out of the Air Force, have collection responsibilities for UAP

95
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,920
and descended foreign space vehicles. The Navy is a bit more interesting. Sure,

96
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,760
we have Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who speaks openly about UAP and OPNAV regulations to restrict

97
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,200
UAP reporting I covered in my USO videos, but I can't help thinking about the Wilson Davis memo.

98
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,040
After all, if this memo is true, which I fully believe it is, DIA Director and Vice Admiral

99
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:09,600
Thomas Wilson was Stonewalled from reading into the program. This was our witness's first ever

100
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,280
interaction with the program. Throughout Vietnam, several rapid reaction units were on standby

101
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,320
for retrieval purposes, and it's here the witness adds some interesting context.

102
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,120
That's what everyone called it, the program, and there were several rapid reaction units

103
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,920
stationed throughout in theater. See, we learned from the Korean War that these things are attracted

104
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,880
to conflict, and I guess that makes sense. It's probably one of the most interesting things we

105
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,520
do. A lot of people think this whole mess started in World War II, and maybe it did,

106
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,840
but the program got put together during the Korean War, and that's when it was official.

107
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,880
The Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953. While the first US-based retrieval of a UAP occurred in

108
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,440
Roswell in 1947, it is possible the program took a few years to put together. If we are going to

109
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
believe the MJ-12 documents, the program in charge of UAP investigation, crash retrieval,

110
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,520
and reverse engineering, operated under US President Truman and briefed President Eisenhower

111
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:16,240
who took office in 1953. This means the program was put together during 1945 more like 1947 to 1950,

112
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,840
fitting in nicely with the realm of the Korean War. We can of course guess the program was already

113
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,280
implemented by 1950 when senior radio engineer wrote to the Canadian Controller of Telecommunications

114
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,880
in the Department of Transport stating the US was actively engaged in studying UAP in an effort

115
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,320
so classified it rated even higher than the H-bomb. This information was provided to the

116
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,480
engineer Wilbert B. Smith by physicist and member of the US Research and Development Board and

117
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
student under Einstein, Robert Sarbacher. I highly recommend my video on this subject,

118
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,280
as it very well may cover the early days of the program. The witness also states,

119
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,320
these things are attracted to conflict. Well, we know from numerous stories including

120
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,760
Robert Salas and Mounds from Air Force Base, UAP have a direct interest in observing and interacting

121
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,440
with nuclear arms. We know from the testimony of Bob Jacobs, UAP have even an interest in dummy

122
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,440
flights of ICBMs. And if the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash is true, let's remember this happening

123
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,760
during Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which oversaw extensive nuclear testing. It certainly looks like

124
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,600
they want to understand how far we've advanced in our nuclear fizzle kind of technologies at the

125
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,400
very least. I mean, it looks like preparatory probing activity. It might be innocent kind

126
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,320
of scientific gathering. Could be ISR probing. Anyways, it was at this time the witness and

127
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,360
his fellow platoon mates were read into the program. Joining the program was by force.

128
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,640
The soldiers were faced with this or a general discharge. Likely drug charges are an Article

129
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,240
15, which gives military commanders an easy way to punish minor infractions breaching military

130
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,560
conduct. This draws my attention to an alleged crash retrieval that occurred on April 12, 1954,

131
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
related to Leonard Stringfield by a witness K.A. You can read about this in Stringfield's UFO

132
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,880
crash retrieval status report three, amassing the evidence. And the link, of course, will be in the

133
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,800
description. In this incident, K.A. and the USAF crew rescue four out of Roswell Air Force Base

134
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,560
were dispatched to a site 25 to 30 miles northwest where they observed a metallic saucer crashed

135
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,840
edgewise into the sand with a dome in its center. A ground crew and fatigues was already at this

136
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,600
site prevented the men from getting closer and began tagging debris and scattered NHI bodies.

137
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,280
K.A. returned to Roswell was debriefed for three days in a quote unquote living hell and told by

138
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,480
men identifying as intelligence officers in civilian clothes not to speak about the incident.

139
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,240
Reading to K.A. a law that referred to a fine imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge.

140
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,040
Our witness states his introduction to the program was highly compartmentalized.

141
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,240
He was only told what he needed to know. This mirrors accurately the compartmentalization

142
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,760
discussed in the Wilson Davis memo. The four programs that referred Admiral Wilson to the

143
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,880
program were quote part of it in different compartments placed in different layers of

144
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,560
the compartment's pyramid split up to do different things of parts of it. It is interesting to hear

145
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,960
our witness state I didn't even realize those damn things were from space until I actually saw a body.

146
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,080
So some of these craft are indeed from space and some are manned vessels. We know from my

147
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,840
fast walker video there is factual evidence USG elements had a term for objects entering or

148
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,000
leaving Earth's atmosphere denoted as fast walkers and defense support satellites were likely

149
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,680
used to monitor these objects. And the subject of bodies can be pretty contentious but like David

150
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,960
Gruss said well naturally when you recover something that's either landed or crashed

151
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,960
sometimes you encounter dead pilots and believe it or not as fan as fantastical as that sounds

152
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,200
it's true. The witness states the more he figured out the more he was read into the program.

153
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,320
He never learned all the truth but knew enough he felt compelled to come forward especially as an

154
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,080
aging gentleman. Serving in Vietnam I would put this individual's age at around 74 or older

155
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,520
and claiming he had been out of the program for 20 years means his service in the program

156
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:32,400
occurred from around 1969 to 2004. The witness even discusses David Grush commenting on his

157
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,440
approach to speaking publicly and labeling him a patriot. He even confirms the involvement of

158
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,880
aerospace contractors and sophisticated disinformation. I don't think we need to expand

159
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,200
on these topics too much in general as I have multiple videos exploring the full involvement

160
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,320
of Lockheed Martin and Battelle Memorial Institute's interaction with UAP and fully covered the

161
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,840
birth of the UAP stigma. Check out those videos for some valuable context here. After being read

162
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,960
into the program the witness's unit was put back on duty but broken up and placed in horrific

163
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,120
combat engagements. Five of the original 12 died in combat. I know five of the original 12

164
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,960
died in combat. Three more badly wounded. I think they were trying to kill us off. If this broken

165
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,960
up team still served with the first Calvary Division LRRP we may in fact be able to track these

166
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,800
names. Of the 1,000 men who served in this unit 45 were killed in Vietnam and Cambodia.

167
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,400
And the witness states a year after the initial crash he was officially brought into the program

168
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,680
where his primary job was no longer being a soldier but he was now part of the program.

169
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,400
So with this information we can conclude that these soldiers were killed between October to

170
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,200
December of 1968 where the crash occurred and October to December of 1969 when he was brought

171
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,480
into the program and we'll give an error factor of around plus or minus let's say three months.

172
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,480
I have actually found a memorial site dedicated to those served and fell in the LRRP unit within

173
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,000
the first Calvary Division. Analyzing the casualty list we can try and trace the deaths of these brave

174
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,440
soldiers from the time of our crash October to December 68 and our witness being read into the

175
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,480
program October to December 1969. So we're left with 16 possible names. If we filter out soldiers

176
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,320
who died of non-hostile actions we are left with eight possible names. If our witness is telling the

177
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,240
truth five of eight of these names are likely platoon mates of his who observed the crashed

178
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,080
egg-shaped UAP. It didn't happen often but these things did fall out of the sky where people would

179
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,120
see something land or witness beings happening more often than people know and we'd swoop in as

180
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,440
fast as we could in case there was anything to snatch up. I think we pulled three total

181
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,960
craft out of theater and not just Vietnam. Damn near started a war with China in one recovery.

182
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,240
Up to three craft in Vietnam well perhaps there are others who can expand on this. Within

183
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,800
Stephen Greer's redacted witness list we return to again and again and again we find witness 10659

184
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,880
quote first hand involvement in Vietnam crash slash retrieval of ET craft involved directly

185
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,480
with ET technology POC to other military UFO events including dad's presence at 1954 Edwards

186
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,240
Air Force Base UFO landing. I do think this witness is separate from our infographics witness due to

187
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,040
the claims of dad's presence at a 1954 Edwards AFB landing. The witness comments how one retrieval

188
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,160
almost started a war with China the program only getting the upper hand due to China's primitive

189
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,640
early warning systems. David Grush has commented on this a multi-decade long cold war between the

190
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,480
U.S. China and other U.S. adversaries. We're in a competition with their adversaries to understand

191
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,760
this and it's a it's a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long and

192
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,440
you know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states

193
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,480
accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to the subject and I think

194
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,000
the up to secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where a country might make a

195
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,440
breakthrough let's say we that's an adversary of ours and it is so destabilizing. You say there's

196
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,240
been a cold war behind the scenes with Russia and China. There has been a cold war against our

197
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,880
with our with our peer adversaries yeah. The witness also states recoveries in the ocean would be

198
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,200
near impossible that Europe was another hotspot for UFO activity. This was due to curiosity

199
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,480
towards the always militarized European mainland especially within the Cold War and a few decades

200
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,600
removed from World War two. Europe was able to keep a tighter lid on the subject especially with

201
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,320
the European populace quote turning their nose up at the whole UFO thing end quote.

202
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:04,640
The crafts themselves were extraordinary that's the only way to describe them I wasn't there for

203
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,960
every single recovery obviously but they kept collections of them in different places and

204
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,560
I got to see two of the collections. The question of craft housing and material handling is done

205
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,920
is always fascinating starting with a quote unquote collection of craft as we know from

206
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,160
David Grush the USG is in possession of up to 12 to 15 craft. When you say crash retrieval what

207
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,720
do you mean? These are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles you know call it

208
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,880
spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed.

209
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:47,200
We have spacecraft from another species. We do yeah. How many? Quite a number. You're kidding.

210
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,960
No. These claims have been echoed by numerous whistleblowers including alleged S4 project

211
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Aquarius biologist Dan Burish. Sit tight for a video on him but he claimed nine hangar bays housed

212
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,200
UAP and reverse engineered vehicles including the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash at S4. The witness

213
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,800
states Wright Patterson and the foreign technology division is a red herring that this is where the

214
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,760
Soviets would have immediately come looking quote we faked some stuff going into Wright Patterson

215
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,840
and quote it's likely in the early days of the program Wright Pat housed both crashes and biological

216
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,520
material and we only have to look at Roswell to guess that this means that either before or during

217
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,600
the witness's tenure in the program program duty shifted away from the airbase and any sort of

218
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,000
material or crash hiding at Wright Pat from roughly 1969 to 2004 our hoax is perpetrated by

219
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,960
the program. Now there is some conflicting information here as I think back to the testimony

220
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,960
of Senator Barry Goldwater who in 1975 was Stonewalled by General Curtis LeMay into accessing

221
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,960
the blue room at Wright Pat where UAP information and materials were likely stored. Possibly this

222
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,640
means Wright Pat held a database or record of UAP and program activity but not actual materials

223
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,480
and biologics. There were these co-opsites run by the government and the big defense contractors

224
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,000
people like Raytheon, Boeing, everyone knows their names but also people like Texas Instruments.

225
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,680
It was a whole umbrella but the little guys only got a tiny piece of the puzzle. Some guys from TI

226
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,480
would get a piece of something and then be asked to figure out how it works never being told where

227
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,360
it came from and on its own I'm sure these eggheads had their suspicions but it's hard to tell if

228
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,360
something's actually alien. Raytheon, Boeing, and Texas Instruments are specifically name dropped

229
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,560
and we can infer TI is one of the quote-unquote little guys mentioned here as the witness proposes

230
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,000
the example of TI getting a little piece of something. Can we find one interesting connection

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,920
for each of these three companies? Well to start we can find Raytheon name drop specifically alongside

232
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,400
Lockheed Martin, Aerospace Corp, TRW, etc. by Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Haish

233
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,360
as one of a major aerospace company in which the legacy UAP programs hide. In 1956,

234
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,000
Boeing was mentioned in a special weapons study of aviation studies examination of

235
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,080
electro-gravity systems. This piece references a project winner haven which suggests construction

236
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,080
of a saucer creating a local gravitational field designated to serve as a USAF interceptor.

237
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
Boeing was one such company mentioned on working on these anti-gravity rigs.

238
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,280
When we hear Texas Instruments we think of the TI-84 calculator that got me through college at

239
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,600
least I do. But TI also operates within the aerospace and defense industries. Unfortunately,

240
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,640
there is not much to confirm here as the only link to TI I can find is a 1961 establishment of the

241
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Southwest Center for Advanced Studies by TI to work on gravitational physics.

242
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:03,680
And finally on to everybody's favorite subject the craft. The witness makes a very curious

243
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,360
claim. Although he knows these craft can operate in a microgravity medium he does not know if they

244
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,400
are really spacecraft and wonders if quote that's where they want us to think they are coming from

245
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,920
end quote. The witness comments ufology has done a pretty good job at compiling craft shape.

246
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,360
So you got your flying eggs your tic-tacs I guess you now call them we just call them pills your

247
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,640
old fashioned saucers bells triangles whole message shapes but the ones that crash are

248
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,120
almost always the eggs and the bells. In Aero's data from 1996 to 2023 we can actually find the

249
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,120
most commonly reported UAP configurations. Factoring out spheres and lights which in my opinion

250
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,880
often have a more possible prosaic explanation than other configurations we can see commonly

251
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,160
cited craft shapes accurately reflect our witnesses list. Eggs and bell shapes are the

252
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,440
most frequently crashed objects according to our witness sometimes disintegrating on impact

253
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,320
and our witness claims these are likely unmanned drones. We have already covered some really

254
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,760
interesting and possibly credible eggs and oval shaped objects Eric Tabor and Jonathan Wagan.

255
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,400
But what about this bell there is a fascinating and perplexing case that occurred in 1965 in

256
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Kecksburg Pennsylvania I plan to cover soon. Allegedly a bell shaped almost acorn object

257
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,560
crashed in the area. This case was covered extensively by Leonard Stringfield so if you'd

258
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,240
like to brush up before my video I recommend reading his UFO crash retrievals the inner sanctum

259
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,400
status report 6 and if you remember from my Robert Sarbacher video Dr. Eric Walker an alleged

260
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,080
original program manager claimed to have been on site and at location for this crashed object.

261
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,280
Our witness declares the saucers are the crown jewels and he only ever participated in the

262
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,320
recovery of two such craft. I probably don't need to dive too much into the importance of

263
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,080
discs or saucers in UFO lore but let's see if we can investigate the witnesses aid in a crash

264
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,760
retrieval in South America. The saucer we recovered and hit the side of a rocky outcropping on its

265
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,840
way down it smashed the rock to pieces then took out a quarter mile of trees if it had happened

266
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,400
on the outskirts of civilization the whole UFO mystery would have been public knowledge by now

267
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,520
that's how much destruction that thing cost but the craft itself was relatively unharmed.

268
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,680
I will be using the date frame 1969 to 2004 I derived earlier for our witnesses time in the

269
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,960
program. I can find three relevant cases for my all-time favorite crash retrieval handbook

270
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,600
Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood. We will not be covering the 1997 Jonathan Wagan Peru case

271
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:47,040
or the 1978 Moondust retrieval in Bolivia as these craft are explicitly stated as not saucer-like.

272
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,920
One example can be found that was also relayed in the notes of Leonard Stringfield dated March

273
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,720
23rd 1978. In his notes Stringfield spoke with one Bob Berry who claimed a UFO crash retrieval

274
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,920
occurred on November 11th 1975. Berry close to Lima Peru this craft was unmanned and measured 12

275
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,440
feet high and 8 feet in diameter. If what our witnesses saying is true and mostly egg slash

276
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,240
bells are unmanned this may not be a saucer but still worth mentioning the outer surface was

277
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,240
metallic with material deemed to be non-terrestrial. Another possible event occurred in Potorio's

278
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,480
Chile 1978 pulled from the files of Bob Pratt also he learned while in the area a year later

279
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,000
a tremendous explosion occurred that woke up all 3,000 people in the area all houses shook and

280
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,880
everyone thought a blast furnace had exploded. Engineers determined the event was an air burst

281
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,760
the explosion occurred in the air and the blast force exerted downwards. Following the crash

282
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,600
American operatives and NASA coveralls arrived at the scene questioning witnesses. An American or

283
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Soviet spacecraft maybe but when Bob Pratt filed FOIA request to NASA and the CIA they responded

284
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,560
they had no data on the event. And we can find a third case that's also mentioned in Stringfield's

285
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,720
UFO crash retrieval syndrome status report two new sources new data which discusses an October 3rd

286
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,520
1980 saucer crash in Piedra de la Guía, Argentina. Here witnesses in a 300 mile radius saw what

287
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,280
appeared to be a saucer shaped fireball come down from the skies and explode near 7 p.m. Some

288
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,160
witnesses claim the fireball flew in circles before crashing exhibiting intelligent control.

289
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,760
Captain Carlos Lima then head of the space research division of the Argentinian Air Force

290
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,840
officially investigated the incident he found four burned spots circular and 10 to 18 meters in

291
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,240
diameter and notice what appeared quote to be the product of combustion originated by liquid fuel

292
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,240
or some sort of material with a very high temperature end quote could any of these cases are possibly

293
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,680
the Varginia Brazil case so excellently covered by James Fox be the crash our witness mentioned

294
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,960
when the witness reached the administrative side of the program he learned saucers were formed from

295
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,120
a single piece of material or put together at an atomic level quote even the entrance is invisible

296
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,560
until it actually opens and quote but interiors could be accessed through destructive and non

297
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,600
destructive means I have recently covered two witnesses whose claims mirror these statements

298
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,840
identically MS who declared the UFO he observed undergoing inspections at Dugway Proving Ground

299
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,080
was quote flawless like it had been 3d printed and RB who claimed the saucer he guarded in

300
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,480
1963 had a door panel with tolerances so tight not even a piece of paper could fit through the seams

301
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,240
the first mention of biologics comes with the South American saucer retrieval

302
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,840
once access was gained to the craft the interior reeked of decaying organic material the quote

303
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,920
unquote things inside were dead I call them things on purpose not out of disrespect or anything like

304
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,640
that I just don't think any of us were ever convinced they were actually living creatures

305
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,320
well not in the sense that you and I are these biologics featured a crude digestive system

306
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,440
only enough to process basic proteins and such leading the witness and program to believe these

307
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,120
things were similar to biological androids the typical gray alien depicted in media is

308
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,840
allegedly accurate but these beings are a little taller than the famous humanoids and possess

309
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,360
large but not massive eyes the witness remarks how these beings were raised in a dimly lit

310
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,800
environment supported by their dimly lit craft these creatures feature long limbs and knees

311
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,880
quote not in the right places end quote the subject of almost android like living beings has been

312
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,280
echoed by many including dr gary nolyn I think that part of what we are seeing here I mean look

313
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,640
if you're an intelligence are you gonna go down on a planet with a bunch of angry monkeys

314
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,680
who might kill you no unlikely you'll send some intermediary well what kind of intermediary

315
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,720
you're gonna send you're gonna send something that maybe almost looks like them but isn't them

316
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,880
so I think and this is again from inside the intelligence community most of what we think

317
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:20,880
we're seeing are avatars biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions

318
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:30,880
if you will and that's that's the current view of that's a that is a it is a hypothesis living

319
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,480
by a logics had been recovered by our witness specifically at a near UK based retrieval this

320
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,160
event occurred at the same time of a meteor strike in the UK area and I actually think I may have

321
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:49,120
found this incident this story occurred in May of 1996 in Boyle Ireland locals witnessed a meteor

322
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,040
or an aerial craft heading towards land appearing to misjudge its approach shearing trees and landing

323
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,120
in the lake allegedly several occupants were taken into custody by a retrieval team and significant

324
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,280
military activity including American soldiers continued for the following six months even

325
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,640
local police were instructed to stay away the American soldier bit here is key as our witness

326
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,440
states Europe has a default agreement with the United States that recovered materials go to the

327
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,680
US but quote that's the price you pay for having a superpower watch your back at this crash site

328
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,200
the witness states two of five of the craft's crew survived light bruising covered the dead from

329
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,720
the hard landing the program has ruthlessly strict protocols for dealing with live biologics

330
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,640
according to our witness these rules include never leveling a weapon at a bean and for that matter

331
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,080
security is positioned well away and out of sight from the biologics immediately taking

332
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,680
readings to ensure nothing toxic or hazardous is present near the craft and medical personnel

333
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,920
are then sent to the craft area or interior including the lead doctor known as the ambassador

334
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,560
who always spoke at least english chinese spanish and russian the biologics at this uk crash just

335
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,320
stood around aimlessly solely reacting to basic stimuli as the team entered the craft after the

336
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,800
door opened on its own the beans were even let out of the craft like school children in this

337
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,160
instance and almost any other where live biologics were recovered the witness remarks the beans live

338
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,920
at most a few days before they keel over dead these points alongside the fact that beans could

339
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,280
breathe earth's atmosphere are used by the witness to support the hypothesis they are like drones or

340
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,880
biological computers like gary nolan said whatever's making these things just creates a biological

341
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,240
crew when it needs one and they do their job and nothing else at least that was our theory because

342
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,880
their bodies didn't seem built to last and the eggheads found it suspicious that they were able

343
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,640
to breathe our atmosphere so easily of course we do not have access to any living or deceased

344
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,480
nhi biologics in the public sector so are there at least any parallels we can draw from the witness

345
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,000
the subject of biologics and their taxonomy is one of the most contentious subjects in uap the

346
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,320
visual of the classic gray alien small beans varying in color with elongated limbs frail bodies

347
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,400
enlarged head large to enormous eyes tiny to non-existent noses and mouths have been echoed

348
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:25,120
since the dawn of uap lore from roswell to kingman to abductee claims to myriad files in the lennard

349
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,040
string field files similar descriptions of non-human biologics pop up everywhere and this

350
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,520
isn't mentioning countless accusations of the program being in possession of living and dead

351
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,280
beans unfortunately this is also one of the most lied about and hoaxed aspects of the phenomenon

352
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,360
so for now we must stick to the direct confirmation of biological retrieval confirmed by grush sometimes

353
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,120
you encounter um dead pilots and relate statements of quote little gray men whose ships had crashed

354
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,320
or had been shot down being kept on ice by the air force technology division at right paterson

355
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,760
air force base end quote as stated by former special assistant to the deputy director of the cia

356
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,280
victor marchetti our witness goes back to pondering why it is saucers and maybe one or two other

357
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,000
types actually have a manned crew i'm guessing maybe one of these is the triangular shape the

358
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,080
witness in the program had a theory quote this was all being fabricated for us and even tasked

359
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,920
nasa to look for where something like a big 3d printer could be in the solar system some facility

360
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,120
or computer just making these crafts and these things and sending them to earth and sometimes

361
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,000
they crashed or they just landed and didn't take off like whatever was doing this wanted us to

362
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,880
recover the craft i don't know if they ever found anything though there was some excitement for a

363
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,080
while it's hard to hide heat in space and obviously making these crafts on such a large scale

364
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,680
would give off a lot of heat or maybe not maybe they use physics we don't even understand these

365
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,200
are some very charged statements with a lot to unpack we do know around the time of our witnesses

366
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,520
involvement in the program nasa openly denied studying ufo's however we can find a letter to

367
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:11,040
nasa chief of ground operations safety dated december 13th 1977 this page observed only via

368
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,200
foyer request is directed towards the nasa administrator about ufo's detailing quote what

369
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,600
could be a piece of a ufo end quote was examined at los alamos for a period of over two months

370
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,880
additionally on page 121 and 126 of this black vault pdf detailing nasa foyer requests we can see

371
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,760
internal memo admit the agency conducted a ufo hard evidence analysis program titled ufo heap

372
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,880
around the late 70s and this 3d printer has actually a very real basis in 20th century physics the

373
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,520
idea of a universal constructor or self-replicating automata was first proposed in the 1940s by

374
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,920
physicist john von neumann who by the way was listed as being involved in ufo recovery along

375
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,000
with vanavar bush and robert oppenheimer by physicist robert sarbacher i talked about earlier

376
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
his theory explores how a sub faster than light civilization can colonize a galaxy the automata

377
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,120
involve robotic or nano robotic systems that replicate by creating miniature copies of themselves

378
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,680
which grow over time such a feat would require an abundance of material so maybe this heat signature

379
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,960
the witness mentioned occurred near our asteroid belt but the replicator hub nestled within the

380
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,480
dark regions of a solar system for creating craft and i guess biologics is an extremely plausible

381
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,560
scenario this even rings identically to the alleged four-chan whistleblower who stated a ufo

382
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,440
replicator lies within our oceans and these statements by our witness quote whatever was

383
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,960
doing this wanted us to recover the craft and quote is widely known within ufology as donation

384
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,200
craft this subject has been touched on by david grush call it spacecraft if you will non-human

385
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,720
exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed is the subject of eric taber's

386
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,720
aero testimony as this egg-shaped craft was simply found untouched in the desert and features

387
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,200
in many corners of ufology the witness makes multiple mentions to failed in 1990s successful

388
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:21,040
attempts to down uap craft one failure occurred in iran and i am almost positive this is the 1976

389
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,960
iran major jeffari case the successful downing of uap craft is something i have covered often

390
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,560
including in my last video where witness tb states the usg developed technology within the star wars

391
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,240
program to down craft people have been hurt by these craft according to the witness but theorizes

392
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,600
this is incidental and a byproduct of the craft themselves manned or unmanned the craft have

393
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:49,760
the ability to distort perception and mess with minds quote unquote anchors were formed for recovery

394
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,960
operatives to keep them grounded in reality for instance if you and i were on a security team

395
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,840
and approached a craft would say okay the craft is resting up against a big oak tree and there's

396
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,400
a gray boulder on the other side you think of that picture and it would help with the confusion

397
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,680
whenever that effect happened kind of warded off this messing with human cognition has been

398
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,280
mentioned extensively by dr gary nolan and even mentioned an atyp slide nine leaked from christ

399
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,040
for melons personal website and lastly what do they want the witness doesn't know the program

400
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,880
strongly supports the donation theory where the craft are gifted maybe the technology is gifted

401
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,960
to not cause massive disruption within our own evolution we had another conclusion though this

402
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,680
one more disturbing maybe they just left these crafts lying around because they were easy to build

403
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,440
hey guys thank you so much for watching as i broke down the infographics whistleblower who

404
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,640
claimed to have first-hand experience in the crash retrieval program my objective of this video

405
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,440
was to analyze some of these claims relate them to ufology at large as well as try to investigate

406
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,680
as much as we could about this whistleblower to see if their testimony and the individual is fact

407
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:09,360
or fiction so i think i feel pretty confident in us being able to kind of determine the time frame

408
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,760
of this initial event in vietnam occurring october to december in 1968 in company e 52nd

409
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,680
infantry in the first calvary division l r r p close to saigon and south vietnam probably fourth

410
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,160
long and i'm pretty confident in five of the eight or nine names i may have messed that up who

411
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:35,520
following died in combat after the initial sighting of the uap from our whistleblower and i'm also

412
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,600
pretty confident in this introduction to the program october to december in 1969 and his years

413
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:50,400
of service 1969 to 2004 i'm also medium confident on the three south america crashes and ireland

414
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,000
uk crash that occurred in 1996 these are all uh not very known cases pretty kind of low key but

415
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,200
you know these kind of fit our timetable fit um fit our interest fit what we were looking for so

416
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,560
guys i do have a theory on who this whistleblower might be i now this could very well be false

417
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,160
i don't think it holds much water more so than dates and kind of interesting coincidences lining

418
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,240
up because if i had to put money on it i do think this whistleblower is offering some uh true testimony

419
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,040
here i don't think this is as simple as just something fictitious is a very interesting

420
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,560
testimony and a lot of things that line up to you follow g yet large but the theory remember

421
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,160
just a theory uh for those of you who watched my last video the witness tb do you remember the

422
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:46,160
general that he said showed classified uap derived cloaking technology in 2004 and was thus

423
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,360
investigated demoted a star and retired this is general john m rigs guys i think it's possible

424
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,360
that this whistleblower is this aforementioned general general john m rigs why do i think that

425
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:08,720
well john m rigs enlisted in the u.s army in 1965 was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1969

426
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,480
and he then went on to achieve 1100 hours of flight time earning himself a distinguished cross

427
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,200
remember what he said in theater in vietnam a rapid reaction unit this would make sense that if he

428
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,080
then got his uh flying license in the military helicopter pilot he would have then served on

429
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,120
that rapid reaction unit possibly providing perimeter security and and flying the team there

430
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:40,480
right so his time in the military was 1965 when he enlisted 1969 when he was commissioned an officer

431
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:49,440
to 2004 john m rigs was forced to retire in 2004 2005 so this lines up exactly with our witnesses

432
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,800
tenure in the program as well and our witness states eventually he moved over to the administrative

433
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,280
side of the program right well john m rigs was promoted to general and higher up in the military

434
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,720
worked with congress he was also stationed at a u.s army base in in um i'm trying to look in in

435
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,120
germany i'm not quite sure when this is but this would line up with our u uh u k based crash would

436
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:21,120
it not kind of a as our witness says that europe is always ready in a constant state of war that

437
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,960
you know these objects are attracted to conflict there um again this theory doesn't hold much

438
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,680
water but we know that if this story about john m rigs is true which i do believe it is because

439
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:42,240
i do with the credibility of of tb's claims mr rigs is also well aware of uap drive tech

440
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,280
reverse engineering and crash retrieval efforts and let's not forget once he retired after allegedly

441
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,960
showing a bae systems employee classified technology he went on to then serve as an aviation

442
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,840
and strategic defense consultant so not much besides dates and i don't want to kick off an

443
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,840
investigation i can't control because there's still so much more to investigate with this but

444
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,520
that is my little theory right now um if you guys have watched this and you have another theory

445
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,160
let me know what it is because i'm i'm investigating i really want to get to the bottom of this because

446
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,600
this is such an interesting story and as we can see that a 25 minute video takes over 40 minutes

447
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,560
to kind of analyze and not just watching the video right like you guys know i'm not just a

448
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,640
screen cap in the video plan me pausing every couple of minutes and giving my thoughts no we're

449
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,960
linking documents we're linking cases we're linking relevant video footage and clips so

450
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:41,040
yeah that shows you how much meat is on the bone of this specific case i think it's enthralling

451
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,400
and i really have tried to get in contact with the infographics team everything short of paying

452
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,640
to to become a member of theirs to join their discord which i i just might at this point

453
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,360
because i really want to find this out but i hope you guys have just as great of a time

454
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,480
kind of sifting through this video as i did in and joining me on this venture as we try to learn

455
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,880
more about this whistleblower and determine if this is a real individual and real experience

456
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,160
i know i find the um the biologics the androids one of the most interesting things ever since

457
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:20,160
grush came out last summer of 2023 and talked about biologics that statement as he testified to

458
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,160
congress biologics dead pilots as he said to ross colthart has enthralled me and and hearing gary

459
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,960
nolan talk about the hypothesis of biological androids that's just something i found so interesting

460
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,560
if any of you guys listen to the podcast mysterious universe i think this was back in 2017 i can't

461
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,880
remember exactly when they did a show on this exact subject kind of like the classic grays being a

462
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:50,000
biological android so for the better part of a decade now i've been thinking about this theory

463
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,320
it's just been so interesting to my head so you know watching this whistleblower say that these

464
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,600
biologics are like children respond to basic stimuli keel over and dead and die when their purpose

465
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,600
is done it's just so fascinating to me so in the comments guys let me know what you think please

466
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,880
remember to like and subscribe always remember i got a patreon if you think the channel's worth

467
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,440
anything i don't gatekeep any content uh just support what you think the channel's worth and uh

468
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,640
please let me know what you think i'd love to get some more discussion around this video and i
