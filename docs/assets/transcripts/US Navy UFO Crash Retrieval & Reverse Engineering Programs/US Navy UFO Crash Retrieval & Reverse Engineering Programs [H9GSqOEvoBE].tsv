0	5400	Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security
5400	10320	Agency in the United States, deputy director at CIA, director of Naval Intelligence and
10320	16480	a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really
16480	22520	accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man
22520	23880	who had to know.
23880	28800	So I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the
28800	37200	U.K. and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered
37200	40720	under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have
40720	43640	possession of the hardware associated with this.
43640	45840	In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon as to...
45840	47360	A craft, a spaceship.
47360	49720	Several of them, and they were in operational condition.
58800	87760	The paper incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile and a half of water
87760	89760	north Atlantic.
89760	92240	What had happened, they had picked up a...
92240	97200	There's a survey vehicle working in the north Atlantic that had picked up some radioactive
97200	98200	signal.
98200	104720	It was almost a perfect symmetric piece of metal with marking around the edge and it
104720	110600	was just a triangular shape, but no glass, nothing that would appear to be a hatch or
110600	114840	a cockpit of any type.
114840	121040	From Roswell in 1947 to Jake Barber in 2024, on this channel we have discussed extensively
121040	127120	UFO crash retrieval operations performed by UFO legacy programs involving the United States
127120	129080	Army and Air Force.
129080	133200	Over the past decades, these retrievals are alleged to have occurred over the continental
133200	139240	United States, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, the former Soviet Union, China, and numerous lands
139240	140560	around the globe.
140560	145400	In several U.S. incidents, rapid reaction response teams are detailed to fly in via
145400	151160	helicopter, drive in via flatbed truck, or utilize any vehicle system to retrieve non-human
151160	157000	craft and transport them to clandestine above and below ground military installations.
157000	162120	But what about retrieval operations that must be conducted in the oceans of our planet?
162120	167760	What happens when UFOs crash into water or USOs, unidentified submerged objects must
167760	169040	be recovered?
169040	173640	How are such operations conducted in the most mysterious corners of our planet where only
173640	178080	roughly 26% of our oceans floors have been mapped?
178080	183160	This would of course require the most powerful seafaring military on the planet, the United
183160	188920	States Navy, and it's a measurable special access programs, internal intelligence offices,
188920	193880	corporate programs, and partnerships with shadowy U.S. intelligence apparatuses.
193880	199200	What does the Navy just retrieve UFO and USOs in our water, or do they, like many retrieval
199200	203720	instances we have covered on this channel involving the Army and Air Force, additionally
203720	209960	engage in storage, exploitation, and reverse engineering of technologies of unknown origin?
209960	215480	For this reason, I want to dive in and explore the modus operandi, operational history, and
215480	219960	key players in U.S. UFO Navy legacy programs.
219960	225360	On the research we will explore in this project, I theorize naval UFO programs can be delegated
225360	231560	to four major components of operation, monitor, collect, store, and exploit.
231560	235720	These operations are likely conducted out of the Office of Naval Research and Office
235720	241920	of Naval Intelligence in conjunction with U.S. Special Forces Command, SOCOM, shadowy intelligence
241920	246680	organizations like the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office and Navy
246680	253960	Special Program, and involve U.S. naval stations like NAWC China Lake and NSWC Crane, while
253960	259680	engaging with defense contractors and FFRDCs such as Lockheed Martin for utilization of
259680	264320	their now-retired deep-submergence rescue vehicles Mystic and Avalon.
264320	269520	This investigation will explore in tremendous detail the three components of naval UFO programs
269520	275800	I outlined above, UFO and USO collection, NHI craft storage, and technologies of unknown
275800	278800	origin, TUO, exploitation.
278800	284580	One major cornerstone I theorize exists in naval UFO programs, monitor, will be largely
284580	286800	emitted from today's exploration.
286800	291920	While the topic of possible undersea UFO bases or installations is well worth investigating
291920	296920	in the future, I have covered the topic of USO reports twice already on this channel.
296920	303320	These include discussion of OPNAF 3820, a naval regulation restricting maritime UFO reporting.
303320	309000	With that being said, let us look beyond the veil to analyze naval UFO legacy programs.
309000	314080	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we take a direct
314080	318840	investigation into UFO legacy programs under the United States Navy.
318840	324040	We will direct our focus on three key pillars relevant to today's discussion, collection,
324040	327920	origin, exploitation of non-human craft and technology.
327920	332960	In this investigation, we will analyze the alleged structure of naval UFO programs, study
332960	338400	key figures associated with said programs, evaluate a handful of incredibly intriguing
338400	350960	USO retrieval cases, and identify naval installations alleged to hold non-human craft and biologics.
350960	357400	I've been sitting on this information for quite a while now, and I felt quite nervous
357400	368040	about it because the retrieval program undertaken by the CIA and elements of the US Navy is
368040	374440	probably one of the most highly guarded secrets in the US government, and those protecting
374440	378280	it can be quite nasty, and I was warned about that.
378280	383520	On 20 September 2024, excellent UK-based journalist Christopher Sharpe in the Liberation
383520	389280	Times posted an article titled, quote, Paradigm changing UFO transparency legislation fails
389280	391800	in Congress for second consecutive year.
391800	396200	The piece discussed the unfortunate dismissal of the UAP Disclosure Act in the Fiscal Year
396200	399760	2025 National Defense Authorization Act.
399760	405200	This exclusion of the UAPDA is another topic for another day as such bombshell legislation
405200	409960	could very well have begun the unraveling of UAP legacy program secrecy.
409960	415640	The September 20 article pivots rapidly discussing multiple programs orchestrated by the CIA's
415640	420440	Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations, alongside Department
420440	424960	of Defense and Department of Energy components that have for decades bypassed democratic
424960	429120	oversight to retrieve advanced technologies of unknown origin.
429120	434680	If this CIA DS&T sounds familiar to you, it is likely because this CIA component has been
434680	440560	accused on myriad occasions by Chris Sharpe and Dr. Eric Davis, as directly participating
440560	444440	in and obfuscating data around UFO retrievals.
444440	449640	For example, Glenn Gaffney, former CIA DS&T director, has been labeled as the gatekeeper
449640	455200	who ceased Lockheed Martin's attempts to divest UFO materials, likely the 1953 Kingman
455200	456440	Arizona crash.
456440	462840	To the OSAP program in 2008, additionally, former CIA DS&T deputy director Doug Wolfe
462920	468280	aided in founding the CIA OGA, or Office of Global Access in 2003.
468280	472960	Wolfe and the OGA have been accused by Sharpe and others as participating in retrievals
472960	477720	outside of the United States with JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command.
477720	483640	Anyways, the 20 September Sharpe article proceeds to detail some truly startling revelations.
483640	484160	Quote,
484200	489680	Multiple programs are understood to be orchestrated by the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology
489680	494880	and its Directorate of Operations, including its Maritime Branch, alongside components
494880	499520	of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, U.S. Navy, National Reconnaissance
499520	505320	Office, Space Command, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and Joint Special Operations Command.
505320	509560	According to Liberation Times sources, missions carried out by these programs include the
509560	514600	retrieval of objects from beneath the oceans, involving the CIA's Directorate of Operations,
514600	519600	the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, coordinated between the CIA and U.S. Navy,
519600	524520	United States Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanographic
524520	525520	Institute.
525520	529840	Additionally, the retrieval of objects on foreign soil is conducted with the involvement
529840	535200	of the CIA's Office of Global Access and Joint Special Operations Command, end quote.
535200	540840	Sharpe directly named military and intelligence organizations involved with ocean-based retrieval,
540840	546640	including two institutions almost never discussed, the Neuro-National Underwater Reconnaissance
546640	551480	Office and WHOI, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
551480	555320	But before we break down these statements, I must detail the evolution of this article
555320	560200	as it allows us to study in Chris Sharpe's own words, information detrimental to his
560200	561200	safety.
561200	567880	By 22 September 2024, the article was revised, redacting all information about the Navy, Neuro,
567880	571200	Woods Hole, NGA, NRO, JSOC, etc.
571200	577880	The new Bear Bones edition still discussed the CIA, DS&T, DOD, and DOE, but all true
577880	580480	actionable data was stripped from the piece.
580480	585280	Sharpe was accused by some Twitter users as making quote-unquote stealth edits to remove
585280	590520	information from the article, but he responded by stating quote, this is sourced information.
590520	594880	There is a real, extremely dangerous reason little information has been released about
594880	596520	such programs.
596520	600960	Content from the article was removed because of the threats posed to me, end quote.
600960	606920	By 25 September 2024, five days after the original posting, Sharpe would once again edit the article
606920	612400	and say quote, okay, so someone has recklessly put me at extreme risk, so I have updated
612400	618320	last week's article relating to the UAPDA, reverting back to details previously mentioned.
618320	623360	This time, the details are far more specific, so here it is, the alleged undersea retrieval
623360	625160	program, end quote.
625160	629520	This third edit is quite similar to the first piece, but expands on multiple departments
629520	635900	and agencies named specialized assets and expertise to carry out undersea craft retrievals.
635900	641080	In this latest iteration, Sharpe states for operations, Woods Hole provided deep submergence
641080	644720	vehicles to quote support retrieval efforts, end quote.
644720	650240	Deep submerged rescue vehicles or DSRV will be a crucial aspect of a USO retrieval operation
650240	652640	covered much later on in this project.
652640	657320	The third iteration does powerfully claim the undersea craft or quote, transfer to the
657320	661800	office of naval research, which subsequently hands them over to defense contractors for
661800	664080	detailed analysis, end quote.
664080	668640	From this article, we can extract a powerful thesis, the US Navy works in conjunction with
668640	675800	the CIA, DS&T, alongside JSOC or SOCOM forces, intelligence agencies such as the NRO, NGA,
675800	681560	and shadowy NRO, as well as defense RDT&E facilities and private contractors to retrieve
681560	685360	and store non-human craft found deep undersea.
685360	689800	But let's really break this down, analyzing the targeted role of the CIA's Office of
689800	694480	Global Access alongside JSOC and global soil-based crash retrievals.
694480	700240	We can assume a similar structure for undersea retrievals where the CIA, DS&T, serves as the
700240	707000	logistics coordinator while JSOC provides men-at-arms, industrial security, human intelligence, etc.
707000	712280	In this apparatus, the NRO and NGA would harness reconnaissance satellites to provide SIGINT
712280	716960	or signals intelligence to retrieval teams while the shadowy National Underwater Reconnaissance
716960	721160	Office provides unknown methods of underwater reconnaissance.
721160	725760	In such a system outlined by SHARP, retrieval operations would be done in tandem with the
725760	731680	US Navy and contractors such as Lockheed Martin and their DSRV and Dry Submersible, as well
731680	736240	as non-profit research facilities such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and their
736240	738400	many deep-submergence vehicles.
738400	743520	Finally, in this hypothesized naval UFO program, craft would be taken to various Office of
743520	748520	Naval Research locations before being transferred to defense contractors to study.
748520	752200	But in this program, I do think SHARP is missing a key step here.
752200	756480	Many speak on joint USG contractor UFO legacy programs.
756480	761320	But a cornerstone of my work has been discussing the missing intermediary, federally funded
761320	766440	research and development centers, FFRDCs, and university-affiliated research centers,
766440	767440	UARCs.
767440	772000	I will not bore returning viewers of these details, but I often speak on how these semi-private
772000	779000	government-controlled RDT and E-Centers act as liaison between USG-slash-DOD and US Defense
779000	784240	Contractors for UFO Reverse Engineering and Material Exploitation Programs.
784240	789240	Such institutions would serve as subject matter experts and provide necessary R&D work on
789240	790920	project materials.
790920	795780	This would in turn keep knowledge access in T-U-O programs quite strict, only allowing
795780	800720	contractor personnel with a need to know full insights into the full extent of the non-human
800720	803560	materials on which the programs focus.
803560	809060	The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs often entwined with unacknowledged special
809060	813800	access programs, special access programs, and controlled access programs.
813800	818960	Such UARCs include the Applied Physics Laboratories at John Hopkins University and the University
818960	823800	of Washington, as well as the Applied Research Laboratories at the Universities of Hawaii
823800	828920	at Minoa, University of Texas at Austin, and Pennsylvania State University.
828920	835360	Penn State's UARC was established in 1945 by Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker.
835360	841440	Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board Dr. Robert Sarbacher
841440	847000	as participating in 1950's UFO retrieval and reverse engineering programs alongside
847000	848960	Dr. Vannevar Bush.
848960	855320	Walker would be contacted by various UFO researchers in the 1980s and make some startling revelations,
855320	861320	not only admitting he himself was present at the 1965 Kexpert, Pennsylvania UFO crash,
861320	866520	but also claiming he knew of the Majestic 12 and to engage in UFO legacy programs one
866520	870520	would need to know about ESP, Extrasensory Perception.
870520	875560	It is interesting how a former TRW board member and founder of Penn State's UARC would essentially
875560	878880	confess he was part of a UFO legacy program.
878880	884240	And by the way, as recently as 2013 the Office of Naval Research has displayed a keen interest
884240	885760	in studying ESP.
885760	891120	The O&R would even publish a quote, revolutionary program looking into six cents among humans
891120	895000	to train personnel on intuitive decision making, end quote.
895000	899120	Additionally, according to the testimony of Randy Anderson, the Navy, specifically the
899120	905000	Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane and contractor SAIC, has engaged in recovered technologies
905000	910040	that respond to human consciousness at the underground off-world technologies division.
910040	916640	The Navy also engages in a tremendous roster of programs with FFRDC's Well Worth Our Interest,
916640	921600	primarily the Center for Naval Analysis run by the CNA Corporation based out of Crystal
921600	923640	City, Arlington, Virginia.
923640	928560	Returning viewers will recall how a recently implicated Crystal City and a likely massive
928560	933480	underground facility beneath a neighborhood in Pentagon as a major center for UFO legacy
933480	937120	programs SAPs and USAPs.
937120	942400	Many of the acronyms sharp listed in his work regarding undersea retrievals need much further
942400	943480	analysis.
943480	948280	And as we move forward in this investigation, it is paramount to recognize the Navy has
948280	953920	indeed participated in at least one acknowledged USO retrieval operation.
953920	959880	Recall the 1962 Bluegill Triple Prime detonation and subsequent UFO recovery discussed by late
959880	962480	presidential advisor Harold Malmgren.
962480	967800	This event took place during Operation Fishbowl, a series of high altitude nuclear tests.
967800	973680	The Bluegill Triple Prime nuclear test accidentally disabled a nearby UFO that went careening
973680	975080	into the waters below.
975080	981520	The downed craft or quote unquote pod was searched for and recovered by the USS Safeguard.
981520	985920	Historical logs from the Safeguard discussed the vessel alongside others such as the USS
985920	991480	engage steaming to the water crash location, searching in a square grid pattern and employing
991480	994680	divers to recover a quote unquote pod.
994680	999880	During net recovery of this pod, the Safeguard actually lost power and the pod was released
999880	1001560	for helicopter pickup.
1001560	1006000	This is a massively consequential case I would like to explore in more detail later
1006000	1013640	on, but let's continue with this investigation.
1013640	1017920	I would be willing to wager most watching this channel have heard of the National Reconnaissance
1017920	1019480	Officer NRO.
1019480	1027320	The NRO is considered alongside the CIA, NSA, DIA and NGA to be one of the big five US intelligence
1027320	1028600	agencies.
1028600	1034520	This agency within the US DOD has historically designed, built, launched and operated reconnaissance
1034520	1039920	satellites providing signals intelligence to the NSA, imagery intelligence to the NGA
1039920	1043280	and measurement and signature intelligence to the DIA.
1043280	1048140	David Grush worked for both the NRO and NGA where he additionally served as the intelligence
1048140	1051660	agency's liaison to the UAP task force.
1051660	1058220	Since 2023, the NRO has had a provable program that tracks UAP projects sentient uncovered
1058220	1060260	in FOIA documents.
1060260	1064760	Sentient serves as a quote ongoing research and development program and quote that analyzes
1064760	1067600	satellite data with AI capabilities.
1067600	1073100	The program was also tasked with analyzing UAP data such as a six May 2021 incident where
1073100	1075700	a small tic-tac object was detected.
1075700	1080460	The sentient report states this tic-tac to be similar to other objects observed in redacted
1080460	1082020	operating areas.
1082020	1087860	In 2021, the NRO contributed to the ODNI's or Office of the Director of National Intelligence's
1087860	1092300	report to Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committee on Progress made by the
1092300	1094020	UAP task force.
1094020	1099980	This discussion of the NRO and UFOs are interesting, seen as they contradict a 2015 statement made
1099980	1105680	by the NRO which stated that no documentation relating to UFOs and that the topic was quote
1105760	1108960	outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities.
1108960	1114680	Furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches in the past and has located no records
1114680	1115680	end quote.
1115680	1121160	The NRO has of course additionally been implicated in providing assistance for UFO crash retrieval
1121160	1122480	operations.
1122480	1126640	These accusations have been made by Chris Sharp discussed above and witnesses I've covered
1126640	1133120	on this channel numerous times including Stephen Greer witness AH as well as USAF Master Sergeant
1133120	1139800	Edgar Fouchet who claimed the NRO alongside the NSA and CIA managed the TR-3B Reverse
1139800	1143160	Engineer Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle.
1143160	1148520	A fascinating document allegedly released by the NRO surfaced in 1991.
1148520	1153400	I have covered this document before in relation to Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team, a
1153400	1158000	possible joint reverse engineering group out of Edwards Air Force Base in the Nevada Test
1158000	1159600	and Training Range.
1159600	1163760	This document is again worth our attention because of the countless groups of interest
1163760	1165200	mentioned throughout.
1165200	1171640	These include MagiOps, Red Flag MOC, Sea Spray SOG, and AquaTech SOG.
1171640	1176400	Allegedly Stephen Greer gave this memo to Admiral Thomas Wilson from the Wilson Davis
1176400	1179400	Notes in a 1997 meeting.
1179400	1184520	This meeting did occur, this is not disputed, however according to Greer Wilson recognized
1184520	1190080	at least one of the clandestine groups listed in this memorandum for record from the NRO.
1190080	1195320	Though the NRO likely works with the CIA, DS&T, and Navy for USO Retrievals they are
1195320	1198600	not our focus for naval legacy programs.
1198600	1203200	The NRO was born based on a recommendation to President Eisenhower during a National
1203200	1204880	Security Council meeting.
1204880	1210280	The agency was formed to coordinate the Air Forces and CIA's reconnaissance activities.
1210280	1215680	Lessor known is an additional agency formed to coordinate the CIA's and Navy's reconnaissance
1215680	1219800	activities, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.
1219800	1224600	This agency NRO is known as the Hidden Younger Brother of the NRO.
1224600	1230560	Implications about this agency and naval USO retrievals are scant, seen as NRO is a classified
1230560	1234960	black agency, but we will do everything we can to investigate.
1234960	1239560	NRO itself has been widely considered to be a special access program.
1239560	1244080	According to publications made by the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, quote,
1244080	1246800	Most SAPs involve technology projects.
1246800	1251360	At the Department of Defense there are relatively few SAPs involving sensitive human intelligence
1251360	1254360	collection or exploitation methods.
1254360	1259520	Examples of ongoing non-technology SAPs include interrogation protocols for high-level battlefield
1259520	1264360	detainees in Afghanistan managed by the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Center of the
1264360	1265360	DIA.
1265360	1269960	And every single capability of all special mission units of the Joint Special Operations
1269960	1275240	Command, one entire government agency, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,
1275240	1278040	is protected by a SAP, end quote.
1278040	1282880	From this statement we can learn NRO is an extremely rare example of an entire intelligence
1282880	1286800	agency being protected via a special access program.
1286800	1292040	But do not be mistaken, NRO is a very real program and we can find snippets of its very
1292040	1297000	existence here and there including a drastic revelation we will touch on soon.
1297000	1302460	This includes mention of NRO in a 1975 submission of documents to the Senate Select Committee
1302460	1304360	on Intelligence.
1304360	1309040	Included in a long list of National Security Council Intelligence Directives is a National
1309040	1315280	Security Decision Memorandum 40, which details both NRO and NRO operations.
1315280	1319280	According to the Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence by Nigel West,
1319280	1324640	NRO began during the Cold War as a joint Navy CIA group to coordinate and fund special
1324640	1327240	projects conducted by submarines.
1327240	1332080	In his book, the U.S. Intelligence Committee, Jeffrey T. Richardson was able to learn even
1332080	1334320	more about NRO, quote.
1334320	1340480	In 1969, as a result of an agreement between the CIA and U.S. Navy, an underwater counterpart
1340480	1346000	to the NRO, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, NRO, was established.
1346000	1350560	With Secretary of the Navy, John Warner, as its first director, the office served as
1350560	1355560	a means of managing the conduct of submarine intelligence missions and exploitation of their
1355560	1356560	product.
1356560	1362000	Those missions involved the recovery of sunken submarines, the Soviet K-129, taping of the
1362000	1368160	underwater Soviet communication cables, the Ivy Bells, a.k.a. the De Clemson Program,
1368160	1373000	ocean floor mapping under a program named Desktop, an imagery and sighing collection
1373000	1379280	from submarines, a program at one time designated the Special Navy Control Program, end quote.
1379280	1383560	Author Jeffrey T. Richardson was even denied FOIA requests on NRO.
1383560	1388480	From what we can learn, the agency has deployed several highly specialized ships and submarines
1388480	1394800	including the USS Parsh, the Hughes-Glomar Explorer, the USS Halibut, the NR-1, and more
1394800	1397360	recent the USS Jimmy Carter.
1397360	1402760	Of particular note is the United States' first nuclear-powered submarine launched 1969
1402760	1407560	the same year as NRO's founding and retired in 2008, the NR-1.
1407560	1412520	This sub carried out numerous highly classified missions including search, object recovery,
1412520	1417280	geological survey, oceanographic research and installation and maintenance of underwater
1417280	1418440	equipment.
1418440	1424600	One publicly acknowledged NR-1 mission occurred in 1976 with the recovery of an F-14 lost
1424600	1426280	from an aircraft carrier.
1426280	1432240	NRO seemingly performed operations to swarm a stranded Soviet submarine in 1981 in Swedish
1432960	1438600	In response to statements made by former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stating NRO's
1438600	1443440	submarine operations in Swedish waters were routine defense tests, a senior U.S. official
1443440	1444440	said quote.
1444440	1447000	I don't know why Weinberger said what he did.
1447000	1450880	Covert submarine operations is the most secret thing we have.
1450880	1456320	The decisions were taken by a subcommittee of DIA and CIA people, most likely the National
1456320	1460960	Underwater Reconnaissance Office, but I will neither confirm nor deny any operation in
1460960	1462800	Swedish waters end quote.
1462800	1468560	An additional high-ranking CIA officer confirmed with the International Peace Research Institute
1468560	1473800	Oslo that U.S. covert submarine retrieval operations were run in Scandinavian waters
1473800	1480480	by NRO, whilst directed by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman from 1981 to 1987.
1480480	1485880	Analyzing the inception of NRO and the retrieval of the K-129 Soviet submarine as detailed
1485880	1490920	by Jeffrey Richelson, we may gain some keen insights into the organization and their alleged
1490920	1493000	UFO retrieval missions.
1493000	1498400	In Blind Man's Bluff, the untold story of American submarine espionage, NRO was established
1498400	1503920	under CIA Director Richard Helms to address the sinking of the Soviet submarine K-129
1503920	1506920	outside of Hawaii in 1968.
1506920	1511480	Though the office was intended to act between the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology
1511480	1517280	and Office of Naval Intelligence, quote, from the day NRO was formed, the CIA took charge,
1517280	1518280	end quote.
1518280	1523880	NRO has seemingly seen a tug of war of control through the CIA and Navy, but by 1972 the Navy
1523880	1529680	regained some control of NRO, seeing Secretary of the Navy John Warner serve as its director.
1529680	1535720	However, through NRO, the Navy and CIA DS&T's usage of the GLOMAR Explorer may be worth
1535720	1537120	analyzing more.
1537120	1542840	To address K-129, the CIA built the ship the GLOMAR Explorer mentioned above, which launched
1542840	1549040	in 1972 to recover the sub under Project Jennifer, a.k.a. Project Azorian.
1549040	1554920	Astoundingly, the ship carried a modern-day price tag of $1.68 billion.
1554920	1560080	I would like to thank medium author Underscored for this great piece titled General Motors,
1560080	1563320	GLOMAR Explorer, Lockheed Martin, and UAP Connections.
1563320	1565600	His article will be in the video description.
1565600	1570040	The piece explores the GLOMAR Explorer being involved in hidden programs beyond the scope
1570040	1576720	of K-129 Soviet submarine recovery in 1974, and was additionally used for nearly two decades
1576720	1578360	by Lockheed Martin.
1578360	1583040	Since the ship was a NRO creation, we can reasonably assume these clandestine operations
1583040	1586820	and Lockheed Martin's usage were conducted under NRO.
1586820	1592160	The article discussed how in 1978 Ocean Minerals Company, whose prime contractor was Lockheed
1592160	1596960	Missiles and Space Company now Lockheed Martin, leased the GLOMAR Explorer for quote-unquote
1596960	1599160	deep sea mining operation.
1599160	1603800	The question must be asked, did Lockheed, NRO, and the GLOMAR additionally partake in
1603800	1606320	these undersea UFO retrievals?
1606320	1611160	After all, later in this project, we will address a scintillating 1970s UFO crash retrieval
1611160	1616320	case in which the GLOMAR Explorer allegedly retrieved a downed non-human craft.
1616320	1621600	We will also discuss an incredible 1991 USO recovery in this project, in touch on how
1621600	1627040	I believe NRO provided transportation and logistics assets to the Navy's Project Sand
1627040	1628040	Dollar.
1628040	1632560	The clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve military-sensitive
1632560	1637640	hardware and other items with national security importance from the seafloor of the continental
1637640	1640640	shelf in deepest marine environments.
1640640	1646200	Sand Dollar seemingly gained actionable leverage when in 1964 a chief scientist of the Special
1646200	1651800	Project's Office of the US Navy, Dr. John Pena Craven, launched the Deep Submergence
1651800	1657240	Systems Project which saw the Navy drastically improve deep sea engineering and exploitation
1657240	1665640	capabilities, but much more on this later.
1665640	1670640	The most astonishing discussion of NRO actually comes from a man mentioned dozens of times
1670640	1674480	on this channel who self-admittedly served as its director.
1674480	1679160	Thank you.
1679160	1687840	I became the director of Naval Intelligence, 13 September 1974, brand new flag selectee
1687840	1689560	that year.
1689560	1695960	I also had a second hat, and they still don't want me to talk about it even now, of director
1695960	1698440	of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.
1698440	1702040	See, I think you have it classified.
1702040	1709520	It's the organization that procured all of the sensitive reconnaissance systems to collect
1709520	1713040	intelligence under the surface of the oceans.
1713040	1718800	Bobby Ray Inman allows us an extremely rare opportunity to understand naval UFO slash
1718800	1723440	USO legacy programs as well as the likely involvement of NRO.
1723440	1729760	Inman served as a highly decorated four-star admiral in the US Navy from 1951 to 1982,
1729760	1736440	while also serving as the NSA and CIA director and director of SAIC and Wackenhut.
1736440	1741040	Of course, if you are unfamiliar with these two companies, SAIC is a premier contractor
1741040	1744920	I have discussed and will discuss later in this video as being heavily involved with
1744920	1747120	UFO legacy programs.
1747120	1752800	SAIC was likely the contractor described by former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson
1752800	1757960	as running the Off-World Technologies Division below the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane.
1758040	1762480	Wackenhut was a contracted security company I have covered before that has often times
1762480	1769240	been implicated as providing industrial security forces who have guarded UFO-related SAP locations.
1769240	1773760	And of course, Inman's dual roles within US intelligence and the Navy also suits an
1773760	1776200	organization like NRO perfectly.
1776200	1780880	Anyways, Inman states in the above clip he took a hold of the highly secretive NRO in
1780880	1782600	1974.
1782600	1787920	Inman had only spoken publicly about NRO once before in an October 2021 interview with
1787920	1791760	David Zerler, the director of the Caltech Heritage Project.
1791760	1796000	At this time, Inman served on Caltech's Board of Trustees to which he had been appointed
1796000	1801440	in 1989 on the behalf of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, and Congress.
1801440	1806320	While discussing JPL's future as a productive national asset working alongside NASA, Inman
1806320	1811840	was reminded of his Navy and NSA days during his tenure in the National Underwater Reconnaissance
1811840	1812840	Program.
1812840	1817440	According to Inman, NRO served as a black program due to its constant need to pursue
1817440	1822560	evolving, cutting-edge technological capabilities to outsmart adversaries.
1822560	1826600	Later on in the interview, Inman touched on his role as director of Naval Intelligence
1826600	1831040	and director of NRO whose very existence was still classified.
1831040	1835280	In Inman's own words, he was harassed for even mentioning the office, quote,
1835280	1839920	In recent years when I talked about it, I got a pretty hot letter telling me I was not
1839920	1844840	permitted to talk in detail since they were all still classified, end quote.
1844840	1848360	According to Inman, NRO was in essence a black program that, quote,
1848360	1853460	Acquired the technology for undersea reconnaissance, ranging from conducting imagery of the ocean
1853460	1858200	floors looking for anything which might be desirable from an intelligence point of view.
1858200	1862360	Before my time, it had been engaged in the efforts to pick up a submarine off the ocean
1862360	1864520	floor with the Glomar Explorer.
1864520	1868720	By the time I took over, it was primarily designed to track the hardware to be used
1868720	1870880	in modern collection activities.
1870880	1875320	The actual missions were conducted by the services, by the U.S. Navy, by the submarine
1875320	1877840	force, by the National Security Agency.
1877840	1882240	I had already been exposed to the Glomar Explorer program when I was in Hawaii as the
1882240	1885320	Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, end quote.
1885320	1889960	So from Inman, the U.S. Intelligence Committee in Blind Man's Bluff, we can learn the director
1889960	1895120	of NRO dealt with technology acquisition and was also a high-ranking naval official ranging
1895120	1898920	from Secretary of the Navy to Director of Naval Intelligence.
1898920	1903520	You'll recall how Inman states he was exposed to NRO's Glomar Explorer in Hawaii.
1903520	1911400	In 1974, the K-129 Soviet wreckage was picked up 1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii, however.
1911400	1917200	Once again, later in this project, I will bring up an alleged UFO recovery in 1973, conducted
1917200	1919240	by the Glomar in Hawaii.
1919240	1923880	Could Inman possibly have been involved in this retrieval in an official capacity?
1923880	1929520	But why exactly are these words from Admiral and former NRO director Bobby Ray Inman so
1929520	1930520	important?
1930520	1935720	I have spoken on this topic quite a few times, but as this directly involves U.S. Navy UFO
1935720	1938480	legacy programs, let's dive back in.
1938480	1944960	In 2022, on the Project Unity show, Inman claimed he had found quote-unquote plausible explanations
1944960	1948280	for all UAP sightings.
1948280	1962680	In my years' active service, I became intrigued by the whole issue of UFOs, and as I dug
1962680	1973640	into it, I found there were plausible explanations for virtually everything that we had observed.
1973640	1978320	Still recently, with the openness of Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, naval officials quite often
1978320	1980840	denied the existence of UFOs.
1980840	1985720	This dates all the way back to 1951, where the Office of Naval Research physicist, Ernor
1985720	1991760	Liddell, stated in a public magazine article that all UAP reports were mirages or balloons.
1991760	1994560	He stated trained observers were being fooled.
1994560	2000120	These 2022 statements by Inman contradict much of this man's storied history.
2000120	2003840	I started out extremely skeptical about this whole thing, I thought this was just rubbish
2003840	2008960	from the tabloids, but I was surprised to find thousands of U.S. government documents
2008960	2013280	from intelligence agencies that tended to indicate that there was a little bit more
2013280	2018200	to this than met the eye, so I went to seek guidance from the various highest levels of
2018200	2022440	the United States intelligence community, and I was quite alarmed at what I was able
2022440	2023440	to learn.
2023440	2028280	Now, we are, in this report that we're now going to show, we're going to hear a conversation
2028280	2029840	featuring you.
2029840	2031880	Tell me the context of that conversation.
2031880	2037160	Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security
2037160	2042040	Agency in the United States, Deputy Director at CIA, Director of Naval Intelligence, and
2042040	2048080	a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist, and clearly someone that if this was really
2048080	2054320	accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man
2054320	2055640	who had to know.
2055640	2060280	So I was able to contact him, thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here
2060280	2068960	in the U.K., and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered
2068960	2072480	under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have
2072480	2075400	possession of the hardware associated with this.
2075400	2077400	In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon.
2077400	2078400	A craft.
2078400	2079400	A spaceship.
2079400	2083840	Several of them, and they were in operational condition, which I assume suggested that they
2083840	2087720	had been in contact, that they had been given these craft for some reason or another, because
2087720	2089680	they certainly weren't crashed vehicles.
2089680	2094800	In a 1989 telephone call, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman would tell NASA mission specialist
2094800	2100880	Bob Eschler, Deputy Director of the CIA, DSNT, Everett Heineman, would be the best person
2100880	2106080	to ask if recovered vehicles would be available for technological research outside of military
2106080	2107080	circles.
2107080	2112200	To quote Inman in this call, quote, the deputy director for science and technology at CIA
2112200	2113760	is named Everett Heineman.
2113760	2117360	He is in fact getting ready to retire in the very near future.
2117360	2121040	That may make him somewhat more willing to have dialogues than he otherwise would have
2121040	2122040	had.
2122040	2126280	When I knew him in that period seven to ten years ago, he was a person of very substantial
2126280	2129040	integrity and just good common sense.
2129040	2133120	So as a place to start, he would clearly be high on the list, end quote.
2133120	2138040	And we actually have recorded snippets of this phone call between Eschler and Inman.
2138040	2144640	Do you anticipate that any of the recovered vehicles would never become available for
2144640	2148440	technological research outside of the military circles?
2148440	2153400	Ten years ago, the answer would have been, whether it's time it evolved, they're beginning
2153400	2157040	to become more open on it, there's a possibility.
2157040	2160120	Eschler would go on to receive this call from Admiral Inman.
2160120	2166360	Mr. Eschler, this is Tom King, an Admiral Inman's office, yet you would be breaching
2166360	2172280	confidence and or violation of the secret three laws and discussing his involvement
2172280	2173800	in any matter.
2173800	2178920	Interesting how Inman, a former neuro director, would refer Eschler to a CIA DS&T director
2178920	2181240	for recovered anomalous vehicles.
2181240	2186240	CIA DS&T was, of course, one half of the founding agencies behind neuro.
2186240	2192200	To note, while Heineman served as CIA DS&T deputy director from 1979 to 1982, he would
2192320	2198520	go on to direct program B in the National Reconnaissance Program from 1982 to 1989.
2198520	2203080	Possibly, this is where a neuro director and NRO program director first encountered
2203080	2205880	UFO legacy programs together.
2205880	2210080	Heineman and Eschler arranged to meet at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia,
2210080	2212080	10 August, 1989.
2212080	2217920	In this meeting, Heineman would deny any knowledge of UFO or UFO legacy programs, however, in
2217920	2224480	2022, Twitter user RGH underscore UFOs would contact Heineman regarding comments made by
2224480	2228640	Inman that Heineman was knowledgeable on U.S. UFO programs.
2228640	2233800	In this instance, Heineman did not deny, but instead said, quote, I am a long way and quite
2233800	2237840	a few years from working in the area you are researching, end quote.
2237840	2243040	Heineman would offer to answer any questions relating to UFOs, but never responded to RGH,
2243040	2248000	and as of this time, I have additionally attempted to contact Heineman to no response.
2248000	2253440	RGH's inquiries into UFO programs revolved around Heineman's time in the NRO's program
2253440	2258760	B. As we just mentioned above, program B served as the CIA's initiative to build and operate
2258760	2261200	satellites for sigint purposes.
2261200	2265280	Heineman was the first chief of the facility for the ground element of the program in Pine
2265280	2266800	Gap, Australia.
2266800	2270720	It is fascinating to think Heineman could have been working on UFO legacy programs in
2270720	2277320	the 1980s out of the illustrious and infamous Pine Gap for a joint CIA and NRO program.
2277320	2281520	More pertinent to our investigation today, Inman would additionally connect Echler with
2281520	2285200	another former director of Naval Intelligence, Sumner Shapiro.
2285200	2289040	It is unknown if like Inman, Shapiro served on the NRO.
2289040	2294080	In 1989, Echler met Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with the group
2294080	2299760	that managed UFO information, and at this time Shapiro was retired as director of Naval
2299760	2303600	Intelligence and served as an executive with BDM International.
2303600	2308400	BDM is of course a former defense contractor purchased by Northrop Grumman, I directly
2308400	2312240	accused of being involved with UFO legacy programs.
2312240	2317240	Shapiro told Echler factions within the U.S. possess extra-terrestrial vehicles that he,
2317240	2320240	Shapiro, had even studied at close quarters.
2320240	2324740	According to the former DNI, teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them
2324740	2327280	around the country to different laboratories.
2327280	2332800	This craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an exact sequence
2332800	2334320	to be put back together.
2334320	2339160	However, Shapiro was incredibly careful with what information he divulged to Echler, never
2339160	2344200	specifying where vehicles and technology were taken to protect classified information.
2344200	2349040	Echler would meet Shapiro for a second time in the Admiral's Virginia home in 1990.
2349040	2352840	This visit was far less actionable and concluded abruptly.
2352840	2356120	According to Bob Echler, as relayed by author Timothy Good, quote,
2382840	2400280	But before we move on from discussing Echler and insights he gained from senior naval officials,
2400280	2405720	Echler would also claim Navy EMP experiments were utilized out of Pensacola Naval Air Station
2405720	2408400	to down UFOs for retrievals.
2408400	2412920	These involved Empress and Empress II onboard EMP generators.
2412920	2418400	Inman and Shapiro are not the only naval officials who have spoken on UFO legacy programs.
2418400	2423840	In 2021, now deceased former Navy Director of Science and Technology Development, Nats
2423840	2430160	Kobitz told Ross Colthart he was, during his service, read into a Navy UFO crash retrieval
2430160	2432200	and reverse engineering program.
2432200	2437400	Although Kobitz didn't actively engage with TUO or technologies of unknown origin, he
2437400	2441960	was read into an active program that had retrieved multiple UAP.
2441960	2447680	He called me on an open line out of the blue and I could barely believe who he was.
2447680	2450160	His name was Nats Kobitz.
2450160	2457400	He was the US Navy's former long-time director of science and technology development, their
2457400	2463720	chief R&D scientist, their chief geek for many years, for over 30 years.
2463720	2470120	And sadly, when I caught up with him, he was dying from cancer and faked dictated that
2470120	2472800	I caught him at the perfect time.
2472800	2479880	And over several months, he finally opened up to me about what he was on his own admission
2479880	2482200	read into.
2482200	2488720	He was briefed on the program and he told me that he had been read into a classified
2488720	2497440	program involving retrieved non-human technology, recovered alien spacecraft.
2497440	2502360	He eventually admitted that he was officially briefed that America had retrieved multiple
2502360	2509280	non-human craft and that he was aware there was a secret operation underway for decades
2509280	2515360	in his words to undertake to reverse engineer them.
2515360	2522200	He admitted that most of what he knew was effectively hearsay, although from some excellent
2522200	2523840	official sources.
2523840	2528920	This is something he'd been briefed into in his official capacity.
2528920	2535080	He did admit that on one occasion he was flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, literally
2535080	2542200	taken deep underground, taken to a secure room and shown what looked like some kind
2542200	2549320	of bulkhead from a craft which he believed was constructed in a way that defied conventional
2549320	2551400	explanation.
2551400	2559200	The craft's skin and inner bulkhead were composites bonded at an atomic level.
2559200	2564000	He suspected it was non-human intelligence technology.
2564000	2570080	But being the scientist he was infuriatingly, he wouldn't say to me it was alien tech.
2570080	2577920	He would just say it was something he had never seen that any human could make.
2577920	2578920	That was a patriot.
2578920	2582360	He was a decent, honorable public servant.
2582360	2587520	He respected the fact that this program was being kept secret for a reason.
2587520	2593240	But as a scientist, he also recognized that the American public and especially Congress
2593240	2598400	had the right to know what was being done with taxpayer dollars.
2598400	2604880	And he frankly told me that as far as he knew, there was no good justification for keeping
2604880	2611240	it secret.
2611240	2615880	Remember all the way back to Chris Sharpe's mysterious reporting on USO Legacy programs
2615880	2620560	involving the CIA, DSNT, Navy, Neuro, SOCOM and others.
2620560	2624920	To quote Chris in the third iteration of the article, quote, it is further understood that
2624920	2629800	the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has provided deep-submergence vehicles to support
2629800	2631600	these retrieval efforts, end quote.
2631600	2636960	Woods Hole, or WHOI as I will call them here, is quote, dedicated to advancing knowledge
2636960	2641160	of the ocean and its connection with the earth systems through a sustained commitment to
2641160	2645920	excellence in science, engineering and education, and to the application of this knowledge to
2645920	2648560	problems facing society, end quote.
2648560	2653560	The non-profit research and higher education facility is dedicated to the study of marine
2653560	2655720	science and engineering.
2655720	2660960	During the Cold War, 1985 to be exact, the US Navy deployed a classified mission to investigate
2660960	2666680	the wreckage of the USS Thresher and USS Scorpion, which had sunk in the North Atlantic Ocean
2666680	2670440	at depths of between 10,000 and 15,000 feet.
2670440	2672360	Sounds like a neuro-investigation, no?
2672360	2676640	While this mission led to the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, the operational
2676640	2681680	team and vessel that discovered the RMS Titanic was from Woods Hole.
2681680	2688040	WHOI employs a host of highly advanced underwater vehicles that include human-occupied submersibles,
2688040	2691400	remote-controlled vehicles, autonomous and towed robots.
2691400	2697080	These include the AUV Sentry Autonomous Exploration Vehicle capable of exploring depths of nearly
2697080	2703720	20,000 feet or 6,000 meters, the HOV Alvin, a three-person research submersible, and the
2703720	2707920	HOV Deepsea Challenger used by filmmaker James Cameron.
2707920	2714240	WHOI works closely with US military, specifically the Navy, where it develops technology including
2714240	2720400	ocean battle space sensors, unmanned undersea vehicles, and acoustic navigation and comm systems.
2720400	2725680	As a matter of fact, going back decades Woods Hole was involved with the Atomic Energy Commission,
2725680	2730840	the precursor to the Department of Energy that highly likely housed UFO legacy programs while
2730840	2737240	also serving as the gatekeepers for UFO data and materials, misclassifying such as trans-classified
2737240	2739040	foreign nuclear material.
2739040	2745240	From 1948 to 1949, a gentleman named William Webster served on the Military Liaison Committee
2745240	2747240	for the Atomic Energy Commission.
2747240	2752320	Webster was not only a member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation, but was
2752320	2757800	also a trustee of the Rand Corporation and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
2757800	2763920	WHOI even manages the Navy Oceanographic Research Laboratory for the Department of the Navy.
2763920	2770360	This WHOI lab is now part of the Naval Research Laboratory NRL, however, the National Oceanographic
2770360	2776400	Research Laboratory was formed by a Federal Contract Research Center, or FCRC, the precursor
2776400	2780560	to FFRDC, which I talk about quite often.
2780560	2785680	Present day, Woods Hole also manages projects for the Office of Naval Research, such as Project
2785680	2786800	Sundance.
2786800	2792960	In fact, since 2002, Woods Hole has been awarded over $3.4 billion in federal awards
2793040	2796760	in the form of contracts, subcontracts, and grants.
2796760	2801720	Analyzing such contracts, we can find some data of extreme interest, such as National
2801720	2806720	Defense R&D Services with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, whose crane division I have
2806720	2812840	directly accused runs an underground installation with Science Applications International Corporation,
2812840	2815680	housing the Off-World Technologies Division.
2815680	2822640	Historically, WHOI has been awarded these contracts by NSWC via sole-source contracts, a contract
2822640	2828120	method Dr. Eric Davis has spoken of, that are used in UFO legacy programs to maintain
2828120	2830560	compartmentalization and secrecy.
2830560	2835920	Woods Hole is given such sole-source, indefinite delivery contracts because, quote, the government
2835920	2841840	believes that the supplier has unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained, end quote.
2841840	2848080	And speaking of SAIC, Woods Hole has also been granted R&D contracts with SAIC and NSWC
2848080	2851360	Crane Weapon Systems Division, JXN.
2851360	2855720	But it doesn't stop there, Woods Hole has been given numerous indefinite delivery and
2855720	2861680	definite quantity NSWC contracts to build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support
2861680	2872800	unmanned undersea vehicles specifically for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center installations.
2872880	2878920	Now we finally get to the most interesting part of this video, a deep sea USO recovery
2878920	2883600	experience that ties together much of what we have discussed on today's episode.
2883600	2889880	This story first appeared on Art Bell's Coast to Coast call-in episode on 19 April 2002,
2889880	2894560	and I plan on using clips of the audio here, however, if people would be interested in
2894560	2899640	fully released audio where I work with a 3D artist to recreate the encounter, please let
2899640	2900640	me know.
2900640	2905960	In this live radio call-in show, Art Bell was contacted by a retired Marine Corps Lieutenant
2905960	2906960	Colonel.
2906960	2911920	The caller, first name Mark, had been assigned to 22 area camp Pendleton to work with the
2911920	2917840	first air delivery unit before being stationed at Okinawa, Japan at the Fatima USMC Air
2917840	2918840	Station.
2918840	2923800	It was here he began doing rescue diving work on weekends alongside a Navy crew.
2923800	2927920	Mark would form a friendship with the Lieutenant and the Navy who would go on to become a commander
2927920	2932040	of a DSRV or Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle unit.
2932040	2939160	The friendship I made later came back that I was assigned or requested to join this DSRV
2939160	2943040	unit and did and was reassigned to Virginia.
2943040	2947480	And basically what we did was a deep sea rescue and recovery.
2947480	2952720	If we had a downed aircraft, we would go and try to rig the craft to get it back.
2952720	2957400	Anything, any anomaly that we wanted to look at, basically we were sent, there were several
2957400	2959440	teams that did the same thing we did.
2959440	2963400	How deep did you go?
2963400	2968640	We could go two miles, excess miles, you're pretty much pushing it.
2968640	2972400	This particular incident I wanted to tell you about was out of my mind.
2972400	2974720	You're saying you could go over 10,000 feet?
2974720	2975720	Yes.
2975720	2976720	Wow.
2976720	2978720	All right, anyway, go ahead.
2978720	2983720	Well, I'll say the particular incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile
2983720	2986320	and a half of water north Atlantic.
2986320	2991000	The specific mention of DSRV is critical to this entire investigation.
2991000	2995720	The United States created two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that operated within the U.S.
2995720	2998720	Navy from 1970 to 2008.
2998720	3004920	Mystic, DSRV-1 and Avalon, DSRV-2 were products of the Lockheed Missile and Space Company
3004920	3006840	in Sunnyvale, California.
3006840	3013120	DSRVs are to this day some of the most technologically advanced submersibles in the entire world.
3013120	3016960	These two vehicles were capable of deploying anywhere in the world transported within a
3016960	3022680	truck, C-5 Galaxy, or naval vessel to piggyback efficient routes to rescue crews of stranded
3022680	3025480	submarines within 72 hours.
3025480	3029840	These highly advanced submersibles employed a guidance system more complex than Apollo
3029840	3035240	11's, allowing the DSRVs to hover in place in strong ocean currents to mate with disabled
3035240	3036440	submarines.
3036440	3042200	The Navy conducted numerous exercises with DSRVs-1 and 2, but no official rescues were
3042200	3043680	ever conducted.
3043680	3049960	And this is due to no American subs sinking since 1971, and 1972 saw the introduction
3049960	3052160	of DSRVs-1 and 2.
3052160	3057960	It is interesting to note, DSRV was born from 1964's Deep Submergence Systems Project,
3057960	3063240	DSSP, to increase and develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities.
3063240	3068160	The project was initially founded out of the Navy's special program Office, and DSRV's
3068160	3074720	launch date of 70-71 dovetails closely with the beginning of Neuro in 1969.
3074720	3079520	Interesting how the DSSP was also founded partly out of the loss of the USS Thresher,
3079520	3083840	the same sub Woods Hole was attempting to find when it discovered the Titanic.
3083840	3089360	If this story is true, this means DSRV, Mystic, and Avalon's practice missions were really
3089360	3092520	to retrieve underwater aircraft and vehicles.
3092520	3097600	And this is most likely fact, as Dr. John Pena Craven, chief scientist of the special
3097600	3103240	program's Office of the Navy and first head of the DSSP, wrote regarding DSRV and classified
3103240	3104560	operations quote,
3104560	3109160	There were many highly classified missions associated with national security that cannot
3109160	3111760	be accomplished without a DSRV system.
3111760	3116200	The specific operational needs of these missions could not be anticipated, but they were certain
3116200	3117200	to occur.
3117200	3122360	Thus, a DSRV designed, constructed, and deployed for every conceivable rescue mission would
3122360	3126920	also be available for the intelligence quote, unquote, mission impossible that were sure
3126920	3129000	to occur, end quote.
3129000	3131600	Craven's words here are particularly interesting.
3131600	3136520	In 1964, Craven was tasked with spearheading the Deep Submergence Systems project, which
3136520	3142240	led to the creation of the DSRV and other deep clandestine subs like the NR-1 to respond
3142240	3146800	to unprecedented events at dramatically extended operational depths.
3146800	3152200	In 1965, Craven was given a high-level intelligence briefing by a Naval intelligence officer
3152520	3158160	and was informed on the existence of an extremely sensitive program named SandDollar.
3158160	3162440	From Craven's book, The Silent War, the Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea, we get a
3162440	3165560	rare chance to learn more about this program.
3165560	3170000	SandDollar was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items with national
3170000	3175000	security importance from the sea floor of the continental shelf in deep marine environment.
3175000	3178720	According to the Silent War, SandDollar was buried within the structure of yet another
3178760	3182800	secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris sub-program.
3182800	3187680	This hierarchy and compartmentalization of programs is something we have observed extensively
3187680	3191160	in the Wilson Davis notes and throughout our investigation today.
3191160	3195760	Craven even wrote the program is still classified to this day, that being 2002, quote, I was
3195760	3200560	shown an inventory itemizing the items to be known on the seabed and a map of their
3200560	3203280	distribution throughout the world, end quote.
3203280	3208800	To expand on this statement, quote, the salvageable items of interest were spread around the globe.
3208800	3213440	There were plenty of interesting objects on ocean floors worldwide, not just in the Bermuda
3213440	3217680	Triangle, and there was an equal distribution of these objects between those that were lying
3217680	3220600	on the continental shelf and those in deep oceans.
3220600	3224720	There was a skew in favor of the continental shelf because of the shallow water, rocks,
3224720	3229480	and shoals, but much of that hardware had either been salvaged or scattered by storms,
3230200	3234760	Craven would even discuss two vessels previously mentioned to have been used in operational
3234760	3237880	capacity by the Nuro, the Halibut and Seawolf.
3237880	3242440	Craven claimed there was no need for maximum security for these submarines because they
3242440	3247240	themselves, quote, they only transported top secret equipment and teams of industry
3247240	3251720	specialists who would carry out unknown missions in unknown parts of the sea.
3251720	3255240	The performers and the performances were invisible, end quote.
3255240	3260840	As we explore this undersea recovery with DSRV units, we can now study the case with a strong
3260840	3266600	thesis in mind. Chief scientist John Craven was tasked by the US Navy to drastically increase
3266600	3271880	naval deep sea diving and engineering capabilities to retrieve undersea objects discovered by an
3271880	3274920	astoundingly compartmented program called Sand Dollar.
3274920	3280280	Craven's 1964 Deep Submergence Systems project would lead to the creation of clandestine
3280280	3285480	submersibles that were capable of retrieving, quote, unquote, items of interest from the sea floor.
3285480	3290040	Some of these submersibles, such as the DSRV units, would be shuttled via mother ships,
3290040	3292600	including Nuro's Halibut and Seawolf.
3292600	3297960	So now the question must be asked, was Sand Dollar the Navy's first UFO legacy program
3297960	3302040	designated with the discovery, monitoring, and retrieval of UFOs?
3302040	3307000	After all, Craven would state, quote, could I organize and manage a program to carry out
3307000	3311880	this mission using the assets of the DSSP? Furthermore, could I carry it out in such
3311880	3316760	a manner that my family and friends and closest professional colleagues would have no idea
3316760	3319880	that I was involved in such a project? End quote.
3319880	3326840	From the DSSP, the Navy planned to build six DSRV units and additional DSRVs known as Deep
3326840	3333560	Submergence Search Vehicles, DSSVs, that were never officially built outside of Mystic and Avalon.
3333560	3338840	These DSSV-DSRVs were intended for sea floor exploration and recovery,
3338840	3344280	and to be capable of clandestine operations with an operational depth of 20,000 feet.
3344280	3349480	So while we dive into Mark's story, I do think it is possible he and his Navy unit were assigned
3349480	3356600	to a DSSV, not the two acknowledged Mystic and Avalon DSRVs. If this is the case, no such vessel
3356600	3361000	in which Mark was operating was ever publicly acknowledged to have been built.
3361000	3366840	But back to the story. Our story takes place in the early summer of 1991 at a depth of roughly
3366840	3374200	1.5 miles in the North Atlantic 250 nautical miles or roughly 288 standard miles outside of
3374200	3379880	Aberdeen, Scotland. Looking at 250 nautical mile radius outside of Aberdeen compared with the
3379880	3384440	Atlantic Ocean depths, we can draw a reasonable estimate of where this retrieval incident would
3384440	3389480	have taken place. Let us also account for some error in Mark's estimate and give a generous
3389560	3394920	plus or minus 20% room for error in radius here. Therefore, our radius could be up to
3394920	3401000	50 nautical miles larger, so we have a standard radius of 345 standard miles.
3401000	3405000	And folks using the superior metric system here, I am sorry guys.
3405000	3411480	Waters in the Atlantic near the UK are actually quite shallow, however. 345 miles almost due west
3411480	3417160	of Aberdeen sees depths reaching over 8,000 feet, which is over our mile and a half claim.
3417160	3422440	This area of ocean is known as the Rockall Trough, east of the Rockall Plateau. Hopefully further
3422440	3427480	data can come from this very specific location at which this retrieval is alleged to have occurred.
3427480	3432920	Mark's DSRV crew had been sent from Virginia, and as we know from a 2011 Nuclear Regulatory
3432920	3437640	Commission emails detailing the tsunamis in Japan, both the east and west coast of the
3437640	3443160	United States had employed a quote, very operational, ready deep-submergence rescue vehicle, end quote.
3443240	3448760	On the DSRV, Mark served to operate computer equipment on the optical and electronic recognition
3448760	3453720	side and also worked on mechanical aspects of the vessel with mechanical arms and rigging for
3453720	3458680	object retrieval. Mark's team was dispatched after a survey vessel in the North Atlantic had
3458680	3463960	picked up a radioactive signature on the seafloor. A second vessel equipped with a side scan determined
3463960	3468600	a vessel to be resting on the seafloor. Naval authorities thought this to be a crashed foreign
3468600	3473640	nuclear submarine. However, the radar signature had shown the object to be smaller than any known
3473640	3479560	nuclear sub. Upon diving, Mark's DSRV attempted to contact the vessel and immediately realized
3479560	3486280	this was not a sub, but shaped more like an aircraft. And what they did was send a vessel around
3486280	3492200	with a side scan, picked up that there was a vessel on the bottom. They thought first possibly a
3492200	3497240	submarine that had some kind of problem there, not ours obviously. Yes sir. We would have been in
3497240	3505080	communication. The vessel came back, it was much too small, any sub that they were familiar with.
3505720	3511160	And at that time we came on site. But you were getting some kind of nuclear signature from it?
3512360	3518840	Right, there was a radiation from it. And the concern was, was it a weapon, some type of
3518840	3524040	concealed weapon source or was it actually a power source? Right. And we were brought out
3524040	3530600	from Virginia, steamed out. And not to give you specific minutes, seconds location, just
3531320	3537080	approximately 250 miles out of Aberdeen, Scotland is where we were. You can draw a circle and
3537080	3544680	narrate down pretty quick at that depth. You can limit the waters. Yes sir. But upon diving,
3544680	3552680	we went down, like I said, just under a mile and a half. And we contacted the vessel,
3553560	3560360	which we immediately recognized not as a submarine, but more of an aircraft.
3562200	3568760	Communications back to the top, we were told to go observe, photograph, determine what we had. We
3568760	3576200	thought at that point we had possibly a Russian or Korean aircraft with some type of contained
3576200	3583880	weapon source. So as we went in. Yeah, that would be logical. We went in and this particular
3583880	3589320	vessel was partially in the mud, submerged or buried under some mud, had been there for some
3589320	3594520	period of time. And how much were you, what were you seeing of it? What shape? What we saw was the,
3595800	3602920	I would say the rear two thirds. It was a triangular shape. It was waged more. Triangular.
3603000	3608120	Triangular shape. And best likely to describe it, it would be nosed in with about two thirds
3608120	3614920	exposed to the back. Yes sir. And as you come out the triangular shape at the back, it was rounded
3615880	3621080	as it came to the corner. What would be the corner of the triangle? They were rounded on both sides.
3621080	3628200	Oh my. Oh really? And this obviously not a conventional aircraft. Well one,
3628200	3635080	one comment was made in the SRV. The little lieutenant commander is also a good friend was,
3635080	3641400	my comment was, I don't believe it's Russian. And his comment was, if it is, it's not Russia
3641400	3648600	right now, you know, joking. And what, you know, the best way I can describe it, it was a charcoal
3648600	3656760	gray in color. It had some markings on the side. Sir, sir, listen, I'm coming to a break at the top
3656760	3663080	of the hour. Can you manage to hold on? I can if you'd like, yes. I would like, yes. Stay right
3663080	3668600	there, all right? You located this craft, which was a triangular in shape, and you were seeing the
3668600	3677720	back portion of it. Right. At this point, we, we'd come over almost what you, I would best describe
3677720	3685800	as broadside to, to the, the craft, the nose, what I would determine as the nose in was submerged in mud.
3686360	3692360	Mark and his crew had no matching craft or pattern to cross reference this craft. The 60 to 70 foot
3692360	3698200	charcoal gray triangle with smooth edges, no windows, rivets, seams, or bolts, a rounded rear,
3698200	3704280	and hieroglyphic writing along the side did not lead the crew to suspect terrestrial origins.
3704280	3708280	Mark and his Lieutenant Colonel friend both thought the craft to be extraterrestrial,
3708280	3713880	but did not relay this to the surface out of fear of psych evaluations and to not risk communication
3713880	3719800	interception. The surface LPH vessel ordered the DSRV unit to return with still photography
3719800	3724680	and video of the craft. We do need to quickly address the markings on the side of the craft
3724680	3731480	that Mark relayed. And there were markings on the side of it, which were in the, in the skin itself.
3732120	3737640	And how would you describe those markings? You don't know, I've heard this before, people
3737640	3744920	try to say hieroglyphics and all of this. It was not a, it was not any, any language or marking
3744920	3752680	which we would typically see, Russian Arabic, nothing we were trained or had seen previously.
3752680	3761320	But hieroglyphic light. Well, I'll say hieroglyphic light, but more geometric patterns. There weren't
3761320	3766280	large walking individuals with bird heads and, and you know, when I think of hieroglyphics,
3766280	3773400	I think of individuals with a head, like a bird or wolf and then human body just didn't have,
3773960	3780760	have those type of patterns. It was more geometric shapes, but, but you could tell some of the
3781560	3787720	actual characters repeated quite a bit of it was in mud. And then there'd be gaps
3787720	3792280	throughout a mud that you could see some repeating of the character. I have covered in great detail
3792280	3798200	the high confidence 1965 Kexpert, Pennsylvania, crashed retrieval in which numerous town residents
3798200	3804920	observed US military forces retrieve and transport a 12 foot acorn like bronze craft. Many such
3804920	3809480	witnesses described hieroglyphic style writing around the circumference of the lower lip of the
3809480	3814520	craft. And additionally, Danny Sheehan has stated in the classified project Blue Book Files,
3814520	3820200	he has seen images of a crashed UFO saucer that display geometric hieroglyphic style characters
3820200	3825400	along its circumference. This is a fascinating detail and connection to these other cases.
3825400	3830840	After 12 hours of waiting after returning to the surface, the DSRV crew was ordered to dive again,
3830840	3835800	this time taking a marine archaeologist. The archaeologist made sketches of the craft and
3835800	3842520	even traveled down with his own personal computer. Where did this go from there? I mean, now you've
3842520	3849080	got this thing ID. Would you suddenly out of the picture or? Well, we're in the picture up,
3849080	3855320	up to the point where we're rigging and recovering. As I said, we took down a marine archaeologist.
3856680	3862200	And one thing that was very interesting that this individual, we actually monitored currents,
3862200	3870680	did some things, temperatures and such at the site. He was making quite a bit of notes and,
3870680	3875480	you know, really not, not making a lot of comment, but he did make the comment when we asked,
3875720	3883800	you know, is this recent? Because there was no disturbed area around it, best way to describe it.
3883800	3889800	It looked like it had been in place. And he said that it wasn't any more recent than at least 30 to
3889800	3896280	40 years, which really threw us back because this thing looked like something beyond, you know,
3896280	3901560	where we're at development-wise aircraft. And I still had to rule out that it was not
3901560	3909560	experimental aircraft at this point, someone's. But the point that he made that the buildup of
3909560	3915640	the silt mud in the front end would appear that this has fallen in place for a period of 30 years
3915640	3922600	or somewhere in the range 30 to 40 years. And you have, was there an attempt made at recovery?
3923560	3928200	There was a recovery made, not an attempt made, there was a recovery made of the craft.
3928200	3934120	What do you know about that? On the third day of the operation, the DSRV crew dove for a fourth
3934120	3939640	time, this time to retrieve the craft. The team first used thrusters to remove silt and mud from
3939640	3944920	the craft's midsection. So Mark and others could attach equipment to try and lift the vehicle.
3944920	3950120	Immediate problems arose as this crashed USO did not fall under the same procedures and
3950120	3956040	weight estimations used for conventional aircraft. Due to this, the DSRV crew had to make size and
3956040	3961400	base weight estimations. The craft's weight estimations was based on the closest size conventional
3961400	3970120	aircraft, the F-14. We had thrusted away a lot of the silt mud from the from the vehicle. Still had
3970120	3976680	a section, probably about the eight foot that was trapped or under depth, it was more of an angle to
3976680	3983720	it. So when we rigged it to bring it up rear first, use the best language I can, we were going to
3984280	3990120	try to lift the rear end up and bring this thing up on an angle and try to keep everything intact
3990120	3998040	and go. Yes sir. We're rigging that with our calculation for the rigging, the weight, brought
3998040	4006520	it up and it went probably about two and a half to three times the ascent as what we anticipated,
4007240	4010840	which immediately gave us the feel that we're dealing with something extremely light.
4011320	4015960	Trailing the craft as it ascended, the DSRV crew noticed the underside of the craft was
4015960	4022360	completely smooth. No piping, exhaust or mechanical features existed on the underbelly of the triangle.
4022360	4027320	When the vehicle was recovered, Mark got a clear look at the craft. It proved to be six to eight
4027320	4034280	feet longer than an F-14 at 62 feet, meaning this craft was 68 to 70 feet long. Mark stated
4034280	4040680	nothing like that existed in 1991 and as of the show in 2002, still nothing like that existed.
4040680	4044520	The craft was a solid metal form with no cockpit and no windows.
4045160	4052040	Right, it was a little bit, actually a little bit longer than the aircraft would be, probably
4053880	4060840	six to eight feet, I would say, in excess of what you would anticipate for F-14.
4061160	4066360	Colonel straight out question is, do you believe that you recovered an alien craft?
4068920	4075400	I've never, you know, I've had conversations with the individual, my friend that actually was
4075400	4083720	there, we're still in contact quite often. I can't definitively say that it was. I can only say that
4083720	4089800	it was an object that didn't belong there and certainly would not have belonged there 30 or 40
4089800	4097960	years prior to when we were on site and no visible means of, you know, if you anticipated it was an
4097960	4103720	aircraft and I saw a cockpit, I would say it was definitely somebody's here that was in development
4103720	4109400	but the technology would not allow you to fly to craft 30, 40 years ago.
4109960	4115720	Within four hours, Mark and his entire crew were steamed off-site. Mark received no feedback or
4115720	4120920	debriefing on what the vehicle was, nor did he and his crew receive any threats or warnings,
4120920	4125720	not to speak about the incident. However, Mark did state when he joined the DSRV team,
4125720	4132200	he was ordered to sign some pretty lengthy NDAs. As we know from Dr. Craven and DSRV for clandestine
4132200	4137560	usage, this does not come as a shock. Mark would be subject to such intense secrecy regarding his
4137560	4143480	work on the DSRV. Mark stated, even if the DSRV retrieved a US vehicle, they were not allowed to
4144440	4148600	Art Bell got the original sketches of the retrieval by the naval lieutenant colonel
4148600	4153080	and Mark told Bell he would connect him with the naval officer. I am still trying to chase
4153080	4158360	down this case with the help of some high-profile naval officials. More investigation does need
4158360	4163880	to be done on this case since officially DSRV's mystic and Avalon had an operational depth of
4163880	4169720	just over one mile and it would be unusual to employ USMC divers for the time. For this reason,
4169720	4176760	I do think back to the 1964 proposal of six DSRV and DSSV under the Deep Submergence Systems
4176760	4183400	Project where only DSRVs one and two were built. Remember back to the words of Dr. John P. Craven,
4183400	4188120	chief scientist of the Navy Special Projects Office who discussed many classified operations
4188120	4194360	were performed by DSRV teams. I do think it possible DSRV units outside of Mystic and Avalon
4194360	4200840	were built with capabilities akin to the DSSV units. 20,000 foot operational depth capacity
4200840	4206360	with a greater capability for seafloor navigation and object retrieval. And it is interesting of
4206360	4212200	course to point out the 1964 Deep Submergence Systems Project DSSP which aimed to increase and
4212200	4216680	develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities for Project Sand Dollar which
4216680	4222600	resulted in the creation of DSRV, occurred just two years after the October 1962 Blue
4222600	4228120	Guild Triple Prime US Navy UFO recovery. Additionally, this case piqued my interest due
4228120	4233720	to the presence of a crash triangle. So often in my videos I discuss many triangular sightings
4233720	4240840	being alien reproduction vehicles. Whether this be the TR3B XF131 Supercentinal or a long list
4240840	4246440	of prototypes I have wagered to be built in the late 70s into the early 2000s, I believe the US
4246440	4252040	saw heavy clandestine experimentation within USAPs to build triangular shaped alien reproduction
4252040	4257240	vehicles. But this triangular case harkens my attention back to the alleged Special Operations
4257240	4264920	1 Majestic 12 Manual. In this piece the SOM101 allegedly written in 1952 details are given to
4264920	4270120	extraterrestrial craft types including triangles which according to the document were very new
4270120	4276440	and very rare at the time. The DSRV retrieved the triangle allegedly in 1991. The marine
4276440	4281800	archaeologists claim the triangle had been buried for 30 to 40 years meaning the crash likely occurred
4281800	4288600	between 1951 and 1961. Interesting how this date range coincides with the Majestic 12 Special
4288600	4293720	Operations Manual claiming new triangular extraterrestrial vehicles were being spotted at the
4293720	4304280	time of the 1954 Manual. If these retrieval events are true and the inside sources of
4304280	4310520	Chris Sharp are correct, water-based USO and UFO recoveries are stationed at naval installations
4310520	4316360	and locations of the Office of Naval Research where they are then utilized in material exploitation
4316360	4321800	programs. Let us review some cases and testimony throughout history of downed craft stored at
4321800	4326760	naval installations. We will reference numerous sources here including the legendary Leonard
4326760	4332120	Stringfield whose work I referenced often in my dumb video. Stringfield's crash retrieval status
4332120	4338680	reports 1 through 7 are in my opinion the best crash retrieval work done by any investigator.
4338680	4343800	I will also omit stories of China Lake and the testimony of Randy Anderson and the Off-World
4343800	4348920	Technologies Division as I have covered these stories and installations and experiences in
4348920	4355320	depth in the past. Leonard Stringfield was once contacted by letter in 1978 tipping him off to
4355320	4361960	Derward Buddy Hack, a CPO radar observer who in 1952 while stationed at the Naval Air Station
4361960	4367320	Sunnyville, California disappeared out of sight. While serving at the Naval Installation Hack,
4367320	4372360	according to his family, accidentally entered a large door of a hangar that was temporarily
4372360	4378120	unguarded. There he encountered a massive saucer-shaped craft with rows of windows and when
4378120	4383160	the guards returned they forced Hack out and threatened him. Stringfield contacted multiple
4383160	4388040	members of Hack's family who confirmed hearing the story including his mother who not only confirmed
4388040	4393160	Hack's disappearance but also the saucer story. Hack's mother would hear him say quote,
4393160	4400600	it was certainly no aircraft of ours, end quote. In 1979, 6 February 1979 to be exact,
4400600	4405400	Stringfield received a letter from one Joan Jeffers. Jeffers stated she knew a retired
4405400	4410520	Ustaff Colonel who enlisted in the 40s and retired in the 70s. While stationed at an
4410520	4415480	Air Force radar facility, the Colonel would attend weekly commander's calls at the Naval
4415480	4421880	Air Station in New Brunswick, Maine. At one such meeting in 1956, the Colonel was shown a film by
4421880	4427320	Major Lester Goldberg that was apparently shot by the Ustaff. Interesting side note here, one
4427320	4432440	Major Lester Goldberg did in fact serve at the Brunswick Naval Air Station at this time and was
4432440	4438680	the commanding officer of the 654 aircraft control and warning squadron. The film showed a circular
4438680	4443880	metal silver colored disc on the ground. The interior of the craft was well lit and featured
4443880	4449800	smooth walls. The film also showed at least three bodies lying on tables. The beans were short and
4449800	4455640	they all looked similar in appearance featuring a sheen or gray color. None of the beans had any
4455640	4461480	external ears or hair, all appeared to be dead. Further sources of Stringfield, like the anonymous
4461480	4468280	Lieutenant Colonel X, would even state the Navy housed biologics. Such as in 1975, when Lieutenant
4468280	4474120	Colonel X claimed quote, bodies are now being flown outside of the US to a secret naval installation
4474120	4480680	on an island in the Pacific Ocean. End quote. Now the US Navy does employ multiple DOD laboratories
4480680	4487240	and MRTFBs or major range and test facility bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These include
4487240	4492680	the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center on the Andros Island Bahamas and Pacific Missile
4492680	4498200	Range Facility in Hawaii. There is also incredible research I plan to explore in the future conducted
4498200	4504120	by Dr. Richard Sotter that similar to deep underground military bases, the US Navy employs
4504120	4511080	deep underwater military bases. And those familiar with my discussion of MRTFB will recall such
4511080	4517720	installations as Dugway Proving Ground, Edwards 412 Test Wing, NAWC China Lake, Fort Hachuka,
4517720	4522440	the Nevada Test and Training Range, and more. Lieutenant Colonel X also brought forward
4522440	4527320	an interesting connection to the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual which claims deceased
4527320	4532200	biologics were taken to the Wright Patterson Blue Room while living entities were taken to the
4532200	4539720	OpNAC BBS 01. Some have guessed OpNAC is similar to OPNAV which is the Office of the Chief of Naval
4539720	4546120	Operations while BBS is the Bermuda Biological Station, an Atlantic based installation now
4546120	4552760	called BIOS. In Crash Retrieval Status Reports 3, Case 15b, Stringfield relayed a cat and mouse
4552760	4558280	game with witness AF and his brother Pete. This story took place at the Naval Air Base Yuma,
4558280	4564280	Arizona, now called the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, which is directly near Yuma Proving Ground.
4564280	4569400	If you remember back to my video on Dumbs, the US Army Corps of Engineers took a tremendous
4569400	4575400	interest in building underground installations beneath Yuma County, Arizona. This case in question
4575400	4579880	really frustrated Stringfield, quote, what seemed to be a case of great potential,
4579880	4583800	including the emergence of photographs of a saucer in military custody,
4583800	4588360	became less so with the passing of time. Following a series of alleged interferences,
4588360	4593320	my sources said they feared even greater consequences and backed off into oblivion,
4593320	4598680	end quote. Stringfield reckoned this case to either be a ploy or example of the lengths legacy
4598680	4604520	operations will go to silence and formance. Witness Pete, a former US Marine, claimed to
4604520	4610600	have photographed a saucer-like craft at the Naval installation in Yuma, Arizona in 1967.
4610600	4616120	Stringfield tried for months to meet Pete and his brother AF and organized to receive the photos
4616120	4621640	by mail. AF even claimed to have sent numerous letters to Stringfield that were likely intercepted.
4621640	4626680	Stringfield would speak to the men on the phone and learn Pete had been approached by some sort of
4626680	4632040	agency to stay quiet. An intriguing case to mention but a massive dead end for both Leonard
4632120	4637480	Stringfield and us. Our most fruitful case in Stringfield status reports can be found
4637480	4643880	in UFO crash retrieval status reports 3 under case A7. This case takes us to the Great Lakes
4643880	4650440	Naval Base in Northern Illinois in 1973. While we discuss this case, do keep in mind the Office
4650440	4655560	of Naval Research has a major Chicago department less than 40 miles away from the Great Lakes
4655560	4661800	Naval Station. Our encounter comes from one witness R.K., an E-4 grade instructor in Gunnery
4661800	4668440	School at the Great Lakes Naval Base from March 1973 to September 1974, destined for intelligence
4668440	4675240	school. I myself am aware of R.K.'s true name and am trying to vet this individual. On 14 July
4675240	4681160	1980, R.K. came to the House of Stringfield and relayed his encounter. In September 1973,
4681160	4685880	while instructor in Gunnery School, R.K. was assigned to guard the premises of a large
4685880	4692120	Quonset hut at Great Lakes Naval Base with orders not to let anybody within 100 yards.
4692120	4697320	While on duty, R.K. was approached by a naval officer who handed him a sealed envelope to
4697320	4702840	deliver to the commander in the Quonset hut. Entering the facility, R.K. observed a strange
4702840	4708840	metallic craft 30 feet in length and 10 feet in height resting on a wooden platform. According
4708840	4714920	to R.K., quote, it was light silvery blue and shimmering. It tapered like a teardrop with a flange
4714920	4720200	running along its topside from one end to the other and there were no windows, end quote. R.K.
4720200	4724760	could not linger in the hut due to the presence of other guards. Thus, he delivered the envelope
4724760	4730040	and returned to his post. R.K.'s encounter bore striking resemblance to the testimony of a sailor
4730040	4735960	he had met in San Diego just weeks prior whilst on special assignment. According to this sailor,
4735960	4740920	a UFO identical to the one R.K. would observe in the coming weeks at the Great Lakes Naval
4740920	4746920	Station was shot down by the Navy between Hawaii and the mainland in June of 1973.
4746920	4752840	This UFO was picked up via destroyer's radar and came into view making three close passes and one
4752840	4758520	direct overflight over the destroyer. According to the sailor, the UFO was shot with a lucky hit
4758520	4765560	and crashed into a 350 foot deep water. The San Diego sailor claimed the object was retrieved by
4765560	4771480	the Glomar Explorer and shipped to Hawaii and sent stateside and finally to Chicago.
4771480	4776440	The sailor even provided R.K. a sketch that was identical to what he had seen.
4776440	4781080	But just hold on a second here, the claims of the Glomar Explorer retrieving the craft
4781080	4788120	are of significant consequence here. Glomar was run by Nuro, a joint naval in CIA-DSNT effort.
4788120	4793560	If this story is true, this means the Navy, CIA, and intelligence organizations such as Nuro
4793560	4799400	downed a UFO and retrieved it from sea. The craft was then shipped to an ONR location where due to
4799400	4804360	being guarded on a wooden platform was likely destined for further transport and study. This
4804360	4809160	incident mirrors perfectly the 2024 claims of Chris Sharpe's informants.
4810120	4814920	Other cases of naval bases in the Office of Naval Research possessing both information of
4814920	4821000	crashed disks and the materials themselves are plenty. In 1994, former New Mexico State rep
4821000	4826280	J. Andrew Kissner stated sources within White Sands Proving Ground in the Naval Research Lab
4826280	4832120	briefed him on recovered flying disks in 1947. These disks were given to the custody of the
4832120	4837640	Atomic Energy Commission and studied by national laboratories such as Los Alamos, Sandia, Rand,
4837640	4844760	MITRE, etc. This is very similar to my modern-day hypothesis of DOE working alongside FFRDC and
4845240	4851480	to exploit UFO materials. According to Kissner's naval sources, the UFO programs were signed into
4851480	4856440	Presidential Executive Order under Truman in 1948 with the National Security Council
4856440	4861400	serving as program coordinator. With support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Research and
4861400	4867240	Development Board ran by Dr. Vannevar Bush in the Naval Research Lab. Interesting to note as well,
4867240	4872920	in 2005, USAF veteran Stephen Walker would claim while serving at the Naval Support Facility in
4872920	4879080	Diego Garcia, he was exposed to the Navy conducting sensitive operations outside of a large hangar
4879080	4883800	at the northern end of the airfield. Base personnel were ordered to stay away from this
4883800	4889000	quote-unquote empty hangar. One night while the flight line was evacuated, the base was locked
4889000	4894360	down and personnel were ordered to stay inside away from windows for the arrival of a classified
4894360	4899960	aircraft. Walker claimed that despite listening for the craft for nearly half an hour, he heard no
4899960	4906200	jet engine, no brakes, no tires hitting the pavement, no idling, or no Air Force sounds.
4906200	4911400	This experience is very interesting when analyzing the claims of Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet,
4911400	4917160	who claimed UFO programs were moved out of Area 51 in the early 90s because of intensive scrutiny
4917160	4923560	from the public on Groom Lake. UFOs, especially the TR-3B Reverse Engineer Triangle programs,
4923560	4929160	were relocated to various installations including Dugway Proving Ground and Diego Garcia.
4930520	4939080	I must now circle back to early discussion of Neuro and reference back to U.S. Intelligence
4939080	4944520	Committee and discussion of Imogen and SIGINT collection from submarines, a program at one
4944520	4950200	time designated the Special Navy Control Program. Special Navy Control Program is quite similar
4950200	4956840	to something called the Navy Special Program or NSP. The NSP is a highly elusive naval office
4956920	4962360	that's similar to Neuro we can only find snippets of. The first ever mention I can find of the
4962360	4969400	Navy Special Program is in a 1974 Omnibus National Security Council Intelligence Directive alongside
4969400	4975640	the NRO. Remember, the NRO was not declassified until 1992, so this mention of the National
4975640	4980920	Reconnaissance Program, which is the direct funding mechanism for the NRO, is likely to obfuscate
4980920	4986360	the program. But what exactly is this Navy Special Program mentioned alongside the National
4986360	4992040	Reconnaissance Program, especially in the context of this NSCID, not wanting to bring
4992040	4998200	undue attention to both of these programs. Now since NRO was created between the Navy and CIA
4998200	5004600	DSNT, you may think Navy Special Program refers to NRO. However, the Navy Special Program is itself
5004600	5009800	a very real office. Indeed, the Navy Special Program office serves as an umbrella control
5009800	5015000	system for several naval clandestine undersea operations. However, in this context and due
5015000	5019960	to the extreme secrecy of NRO to this day as highlighted by Inman, NRO could have certainly
5019960	5025960	been rolled under the NSP. To further this thesis, we can look back to an 11 December 1975
5025960	5030600	declassified memo for the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and others. Here we get a
5030600	5036440	keen look at the organizational structure of the Navy Special Program. The Navy Special Program was
5036440	5041800	once designated to run parallel to the National Reconnaissance Program or NRO under the Executive
5041800	5046040	Committee for the Director of Central Intelligence and the Assistant Secretary for Defense for
5046040	5051720	Intelligence. Someone really ought to ask Christopher Mellon about the Navy Special Program seen as he
5051720	5058120	himself served as former ASD slash I. The NSP, according to this memorandum, serves to act for
5058120	5064440	intelligence collection, similar to the NRO, DIA, or CIA. Having previously detailed the duties of
5064440	5070920	NRO, I do think this description means NRO is likely hidden within the NSP here, especially given the
5070920	5076680	timeframe 1975, where throughout our investigation we see NRO's activities really ramping up from
5076680	5083400	its creation in 1969 throughout the 70s. Therefore, with the Navy Special Program acting as an umbrella
5083400	5089800	office for numerous Navy clandestine operations, including possibly housing NRO, it is no stretch
5089800	5094760	to theorize a program that conducts undersea retrievals of anomalous craft alongside NRO
5094760	5100200	that sends such vehicles to the Office of Naval Research locations, to then be studied by federal
5100200	5106280	elements and defense contractors would be hidden within the NSP. These operations would be compartmented
5106280	5111960	and rolled under the Navy Special Program Office. This process for naval UFO legacy programs would
5111960	5118280	likely remain the same today. After all, as of 26 May 2023, we can find requests for approval
5118280	5122920	for special access program facilities by the Navy Special Program central office.
5122920	5128600	Naval legacy programs hidden within the NSP for extensive classification and compartmentalization
5128600	5134200	carry sound logic, especially when factoring in statements of former Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet.
5134200	5138840	Admiral Gallaudet has spoken on congressional record that whilst he is aware of testimony of
5138840	5144200	naval UFO legacy programs, he did not directly encounter them or was not briefed during his
5144200	5150040	prestigious position within the Navy. We can find one intriguing acknowledged CIA program that
5150040	5156680	likely utilized the Navy Special Program, Project Palladium and its director Samuel Jean Poteet.
5156680	5162200	Poteet served at the NRO, CIA DS&T, as well as served as the technical director of the
5162200	5167960	Navy Special Program Office, where he provided naval reconnaissance systems expertise for the CIA
5167960	5173640	Directorate of Science and Technology. Poteet was a senior central intelligence agency scientific
5173640	5179160	intelligence officer, inventor, teacher, and association executive. He, quote, provided
5179160	5184040	scientific expertise on space and naval reconnaissance systems in the Directorate of Science and
5184040	5189320	Technology and served at the National Reconnaissance Office as technical director of the Navy Special
5189320	5194200	Program's office and as the executive director of the Intelligence Research and Development
5194200	5200120	Council, end quote. Under the CIA, Poteet spearheaded Project Palladium in the 1960s with
5200120	5206280	heavy use of naval assets, ships, and submarines. The project employed a variety of clandestine
5206280	5212200	submarines, radar reflectors, and jamming tactics to trick and gauge Soviet radar capabilities.
5212200	5218360	Essentially, Palladium performed to fill Soviet radar systems with fake UAP signatures. Of course,
5218360	5223960	our true interest here lies with Palladium's usage of clandestine subs and Poteet's connection
5223960	5229080	to the Navy Special Program Office. According to excellent researcher Jeff Cruikshank,
5229080	5234760	references to Project Palladium can be found in the Majestic 12 documents. The TERS memo,
5234760	5241640	dated 28 June 1961, is a majestic document Ryan and Robert Wood have rated with a moderate to high
5241640	5247160	authenticity. This memo allegedly sees JFK, right to the Director of Central Intelligence,
5247160	5251000	Alan Doliz, in a national security memorandum with the subject, quote,
5251000	5256920	review of MJ-12 intelligence operations as they relate to Cold War psychological warfare plans,
5256920	5264040	end quote. It is intriguing to see Alan Doliz did indeed meet with JFK twice, 28 June 1961.
5264040	5268680	Cruikshank argues the psychological warfare plans referenced in the TERS memo directly
5268760	5274600	reference Operation Palladium. Although Palladium didn't get its iconic name until April 1962,
5274600	5280360	when Dr. Albert Whelan took over as head of CIA, DS and T, the description of Palladium would appear
5280360	5285400	again in further majestic documents. And this is supported in the Medium Confidence Operation
5285400	5292440	Review, the MJ-12 project, allegedly written by Alan Doliz on 5 November 1961. This document
5292440	5298120	describes how the CIA was mapping the Soviet air defense system by using airborne electronic
5298120	5303160	countermeasure equipment and balloon decoys. Such a purpose was to provide a true picture of how
5303160	5308760	Soviet air defenses perceived UFOs. The memo discussed future similar psychological warfare
5308760	5314280	plans very similar to the TERS memo. Details of Project Palladium appearing in early MJ-12
5314280	5320200	documents dropped to Jamie Chandra in 1984 proved significant. Seen as according to an article
5320200	5326680	by Jean Petit in Stories of Intelligence Research, only six people knew about Palladium in the 1960s.
5326680	5332040	Since Palladium was not declassified until long after 1984, this implies whoever wrote the
5332040	5338040	select majestic documents was well aware or a part of Project Palladium. As a matter of fact,
5338040	5343800	the first time Palladium would be discussed was within a classified manner in a 1998 CIA
5343800	5350200	journal written about by the aforementioned Jean Petit. Historically, the Navy special program saw
5350200	5357400	heavy compartmentalization and incredibly strict need to know access. In this 29 October 1974 CIA
5357400	5362600	memo titled Clearances Held by NSIC or National Security Council Intelligence Committee Working
5362600	5367240	Group Members, discussion was held around National Security Council Working Group programs
5367240	5372440	overlapping certain compartmented areas of the Navy special program. For read-on access,
5372440	5377800	clearance requests were required for a redacted name and National Security Council member and CIA
5377800	5384920	officer Richard Ober. This NSC memo was sent just a few days after the NRO memo from 1974 we
5384920	5391720	discussed earlier. We can additionally analyze a fascinating 14 December 1984 memo written to US
5391720	5397800	Navy Rear Admiral and Director of Naval Intelligence John Butts. The memo thanks John for his personal
5397800	5403400	sacrifices in arranging meetings in spite of a tooth injury. The writer from within the staff of the
5403480	5407960	director of the intelligence community additionally informed Butts they had received a letter from
5407960	5413080	the secretary of the Navy John Layman concerning the Navy special program. Remembered Layman
5413080	5417480	additionally served as director of NRO. This letter apparently took a month to get to the
5417480	5422360	desk of the director of central intelligence. The writer additionally suggested John Butts
5422360	5427160	include a representative from Everett Heinemann's department on the redacted special ad hoc
5427160	5432520	requirements committee. Remember, Heinemann was labeled by Inman as the CIA DS&T member
5432520	5437960	knowledgeable on UFO legacy operations. The work here on the Navy special program is just the
5437960	5443160	beginning for me and the ties to other subjects we have covered today is extremely interesting.
5443160	5448920	After all, I have found and attempted to contact numerous former Navy special program personnel.
5448920	5453720	These include a man who served for three years as a diver in the Navy special program with the
5453720	5460440	mobile diving and salvage unit one. I have also contacted one Mr. P. R. who served for eight years
5460440	5467080	as project lead for Navy special program office and SOCOM acquisition program office. How interesting
5467080	5473000	this ties into the work of Chris Sharp regarding USO retrievals the Navy and SOCOM especially
5473000	5478520	intriguing seen as sharp implicated Lockheed Martin dry submersible as participating in USO
5478520	5484760	retrieval and since 2023 SOCOM has declared operational capability with Lockheed Martin dry
5484840	5490520	submersible. And finally, I have contacted one Mr. WH who served for two years as an
5490520	5495640	office of Naval intelligence chief information security officer for the Navy special program.
5495640	5500120	And please understand, I am protecting the identity of these individuals as they very
5500120	5510760	well may wish to speak on the NSP. Believe it or not, today we have only scratched the surface
5510760	5516840	of naval UFO legacy programs. In the beginning of this project, I separated naval legacy programs
5516840	5523160	into four distinct categories monitor, collect, store and exploit. Of course, monitor has been
5523160	5529880	emitted from today's discussion as has majorly exploit has the Navy successfully created seafaring
5529880	5535880	ARV a deep sea equivalent to the flux liner. This of course will be another topic for another day.
5535880	5540680	Today, we've investigated the Navy special program office and Office of Naval Research
5540680	5547720	conducting undersea UFO and USO crash retrievals alongside SOCOM private entity such as Lockheed
5547720	5554600	Martin and Woods Hole and intelligence organizations such as the NRO, NRO and CIA DS&T. We have also
5554600	5560600	discussed myriad senior naval officials such as Sumner Shapiro, Bobby Ray Inman and Nat Kobitz
5560600	5565960	who have all commented on the existence of crash retrieval and material exploitation programs.
5565960	5573080	We have barely begun to dive in and discuss the FFRDC's Naval UARCs and DOD RDT&E facilities
5573080	5578920	that are highly likely involved with naval UFO legacy programs. Outside of mention of Lockheed,
5578920	5585480	Woods Hole and SAIC, we have barely even discussed contractors in UFO legacy operations. Outside of
5585480	5590040	sole source contracts, we have yet to really even dive into how legacy operations within the
5590040	5595800	Navy are funded. I have spoken before on witness Ed who claimed the existence of a joint UFO reverse
5595800	5600360	engineering program between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range.
5600360	5605720	After his service at Edwards, Ed would proceed to work at the Pentagon for the Air Force's RDT&E
5605720	5611480	panel chain where he would claim in two separate years 34 and 40 billion dollars disappeared to
5611480	5616360	non-authorized transfer of authority funds. Ed would additionally work as liaison between
5616360	5622120	the Pentagon and various defense contractors as an F-35 program subject matter expert.
5622120	5627160	As a test director for an electronics warfare group dealing with reverse engineered UFOs out
5627160	5633240	of the Edwards 412th test group, I have theorized Ed's work on the F-35 also dealt with anomalous
5633240	5638840	technologies. This is no stretch as the F-35 program has historically carried an incredibly
5638920	5645000	bloated budget of two trillion dollars. Such bloated budgets with backdoor clandestine UFO
5645000	5650680	programs may have also occurred in the Navy and we may get a keen look at such an instance.
5650680	5656440	In 1985, the U.S. Navy faced a massive controversy for an incredibly bizarre occurrence.
5656440	5662360	Scandal arose when in 85 it was discovered the U.S. Navy had paid Grumman Aerospace Corporation
5662440	5670360	$660 apiece for ashtrays to be included in the E2C Hawkeye. The Navy only began to investigate
5670360	5675400	how many of these ashtrays had been bought and why they cost so much when an investigator for the
5675400	5681080	House Government Operations Committee discovered this egregious oversight. From this investigation,
5681080	5686360	it had also been determined the Navy was paying Grumman $400 per socket wrench that were used
5686360	5692920	to adjust the seats of F-14s and the Navy had also increased payments for ground locks from $102
5692920	5701000	in 1982 to $2,710 a year later. Shockingly, this investigation would also reveal years prior the
5701000	5708760	Navy had been charging itself $954 for ashtrays. For such infractions, Defense Secretary Casper
5708760	5714360	Weinberger, who made some contested statements about Neuroabove, removed three officers prior
5714360	5720280	to any investigation, and Grumman aircraft wind that peace prices were so high due to needing
5720280	5725640	to make a small number of parts to spec. The damage had been done, leading to House Committee
5725640	5731000	investigators looking into larger naval contracts and discovered, for example, profits on aircraft
5731000	5739640	carrier contracts were in excess of $753 million or 29.7% and contractor profits on a single Trident
5739720	5746920	735 submarine were in excess of $96 million or 22%. Where was all this excess money on
5746920	5751720	contracts and parts going? I wager since we are discussing contractors such as Grumman,
5751720	5757080	which I have directly implicated in UFO legacy programs before its merger with Northrop. These
5757080	5762760	funds were siphoned off legitimate contracts or parts to fund clandestine deep-sixed UFO
5762760	5769320	crash retrieval and material exploitation programs. So after all of this, today has mostly served as
5769320	5775080	an expose into naval legacy crash retrieval operations and necessary logistics. More and
5775080	5781480	more in my videos, I plan to speak on naval and special USO legacy programs. This is due to multiple
5781480	5788520	sources of mine informing me Navy USO programs are more secretive than even standard UFO legacy
5788520	5794840	operations. Hey guys, it's Gerb and thank you so very much for sticking through with me while we
5794840	5802920	took this dive into the US Navy and UFO and USO legacy program operations. Now as I said at the
5802920	5809560	very end of this video from multiple individuals that have worked in legacy programs to our tangentially
5809560	5816520	aware of them have informed me that the US Navy's programs are the most secretive there are. Why is
5816520	5822040	this? Is it because the Navy deals with weapons technology as in the Randy Anderson case with
5822040	5828200	the gauntlet and the orb that supposedly experienced energetic discharge during recovery? Or is it
5828200	5834200	because the Navy specifically the ONR is a pristine stop for craft? Or is it because the
5834200	5842280	transmedium capabilities of UFO are the most coveted aspect of material exploitation and monitoring?
5842280	5848440	Or is it possibly because some of the secrecy stems from the possibility there are undersea UFO
5848440	5853960	bases and inherently if this is where some craft are stationed and departing from this implies
5853960	5860200	much secrecy? And that sort of makes a little sense as we've seen with Nuro underwater reconnaissance
5860200	5864360	underwater reconnaissance systems clandestine submarines are some of the United States most
5864360	5872120	highly regarded secrets. We have five major intelligence agencies the CIA, DIA, NSA, one of
5872120	5877160	my missing NRO and NGA and but Nuro is not on there and we've seen and proven today that Nuro
5877160	5883080	does exist. So why is Nuro not listed? Nuro is really what kicked off my investigation into
5883080	5887720	this subject back in September with the work of Chris Sharp. When he detailed and changed the
5887720	5894840	article about undersea retrievals in the ONR, JSOC, SOCOM, Lockheed Martin Woods Hole and Nuro,
5894840	5900440	this really kicked off my interest. One of the most intriguing aspects of this project of course
5900440	5906840	was Bobby Ray Inman, a regular of this channel admitting that he was director of Nuro.
5906840	5912600	And I'm really glad we got to explore a little bit more into Inman and his interactions with
5912600	5919320	Eschler and Bobby and sorry, excuse me, Everett or R. Evan Heineman as well as Sumner Shapiro.
5919960	5925560	Again, as I stated, I've received no contact back from Heineman and I've also tried to contact
5925560	5930680	Shapiro's family. They have not gotten back to me either. I would like to get statements from
5930680	5934840	some other people surrounding this case, but Nuro really kicked off this operation. And as
5934840	5941720	we've seen with Nuro, as a black program agency, all of its operations have been shrouded in secrecy.
5941720	5948280	Whether this entails usage of the Glomar Explorer, the Halibut, the NR Run, NR One, the Seawolf,
5948280	5955880	there is so much secrecy surrounding Nuro and that bridges really perfectly into the 1991
5955880	5961640	retrieval case under witness mark. Now, as I said in the video too, I'm still vetting this case.
5961640	5966760	I'm working with some individuals to try to identify mark to try to identify the naval
5966760	5972200	lieutenant commander and trying to track down those original sketches. I know Art Bell has passed
5972200	5976280	away and he was the point of contact for both of these. But I am trying to track that down.
5977400	5985320	So mark story involves a DSRV or as I hypothesized from Craven and the work under the DSSP,
5985320	5991960	a DSSV, Deep Submergence Search Vehicle. I think those depth capabilities and mechanical arms
5991960	5999240	and rigging for retrieval of craft suit a DSSV more than a DSRV because DSRV was specifically
5999240	6005960	created for transfer of crew from a submarine where a DSSV was specifically tailored, never built,
6005960	6011560	to retrieve vehicles and to retrieve items. I did this fall under Project Sand Dollar.
6011560	6014200	As we saw with Project Sand Dollar under Craven as well,
6015480	6021720	Sand Dollar involved items of interest on the sea floor of particular interest were radioactive
6021720	6027400	or nuclear emitting items. And as we see in Mark's case, the original side scan from vessels
6027400	6032520	and other vessels that picked up the signature of the craft, this was emitting some sort of
6032520	6037880	radiation to the point where the DSRV crew initially thought this to be a downed Korean or
6037880	6042200	Russian aircraft with some sort of nuclear technology. And it is interesting to see as
6042200	6049160	Mark said he steamed out of Virginia that the 2011 Fukushima documents detail that DSRV units
6049160	6054040	were ready and able in the east and west coast of the United States. So let's talk about that
6054040	6059080	incident a bit more because it's very rare we can ever find an undersea retrieval. The only
6059080	6063720	other example I can think of is Shag Harbor which occurred in 1967 and I would like to tackle that
6063720	6068760	case in the future, especially because there is testimony of the US Navy kind of coming in the
6068760	6074280	US Navy divers and coming in and really taking over the retrieval operation. But Mark's DSRV
6074280	6080120	crew observes a triangle. And as I said in the video, and as we talk about in this channel quite
6080120	6087080	often, I oftentimes attribute human origin to triangular craft, whether this be the TR-3B,
6087080	6093080	the XF-131 Super Sentinel, which I almost put more credence in than the TR-3B or other prototypes
6093080	6098920	that we discussed throughout the 80s and 90s in the TR-3B video. But this craft featured
6100360	6107240	hieroglyphic like writing alongside its outer edge, which, similar to Kecksburg and Danny
6107240	6115160	Sheehan's accounts, is not rare but not common in UFO crash retrieval incidents. The description
6115160	6122200	of this craft is very similar to other NHI craft, no landing gear, no mechanical systems,
6122200	6131000	no cockpit, no glass, no windows, etc. What interests me is the aftermath of the retrieval.
6131000	6135800	Mark states that after the marine archaeologist and four dives were able to observe the craft and
6135800	6140760	they were able to get it off the ground and retrieve it, that after a couple hours Mark
6140760	6145080	and his crew were steamed off site and were never warned not to speak about this incident,
6145080	6150040	warned not to talk about it or sign further NDAs. Now Mark inherently had to sign NDAs and
6150040	6155640	non-disclosure agreements for his work on DSRV, which as we know from John Pena Craven were sent
6155640	6160600	almost exclusively on clandestine operations, so it stands to reason there's a heavy amount
6160600	6168280	of secrecy when you sign on for this crew. But it almost appears as if the steamer of the LPH
6168280	6172680	vessel that discovered the craft in the DSRV was still trying to figure out what the heck they
6172680	6177320	had uncovered because it took a couple hours for Mark and his crew to be steamed off site
6177960	6183880	and they were never briefed on the incident, debriefed or discussed it further. I do hope Mark
6183880	6189160	is still alive and I would like to speak to him, I very much would. And then what is interesting
6189160	6195640	with Nuro as well as the connection to the 1973 Great Lakes Naval Station case, of course Stringfield
6195640	6203160	published on this back in the 80s, so the Glomar Explorer and its work with Nuro wasn't very well
6203240	6208680	known, if at all at this time, the Glomar Explorer had been known for Project Azorian retrieving one
6208680	6218680	third of the Soviet K-129 submarine, but just the connection of witness JK stating that the
6218680	6225720	San Diego sailor that he met that saw basically the same craft he saw had told him that it had been
6225720	6231880	shot down between Hawaii and the mainland by a destroyer and retrieved by the Glomar Explorer,
6231880	6239000	and this was early 1973. And then there's fascinating connections that Bobby Ray Inman
6239000	6245560	stated that in the early 70s, 72 to 74 to be exact, he became aware of the Glomar's activities out in
6245560	6252040	Hawaii. So there's a lot of really connective tissue here with these statements and I know
6252040	6256920	I say this in most videos, but our work with the Navy is really just beginning here. There are so
6256920	6264200	many more facilities we need to look at, so much more investigation into China Lake, because the
6264200	6269880	Navy and if Chris Sharpe's reporting is correct, the O&R specifically is almost a staging point for
6269880	6275560	housing craft. Now this makes me wonder, is this, does the Air Force, if they retrieve a craft or
6275560	6280680	the Army, if they retrieve a craft, do they initially stage at naval locations to then be
6280680	6286520	transported again? Does the Navy just satisfy naval UFO legacy programs for storage of craft,
6286600	6291800	or do they also operate alongside Army and Air Force? This would surprise me, as everything I
6291800	6298120	have been told, investigated and seen, is that Army, Air Force, and Navy almost act siloed,
6298120	6303160	very different programs, sometimes doing the same thing, but almost no communication to
6303160	6307000	adhere to the compartmentalization of these programs, where only the intelligence community
6307000	6310920	overlords really know what's going on between programs. So that would be really interesting
6310920	6317640	to track down. But anyways guys, if anybody watching this video has any experiences or
6317640	6323240	connections with individuals who have retrieved undersea craft or know of stories of undersea
6323240	6328360	craft retrieval, please contact me and I would love to speak to you. But let me know what you
6328360	6333720	guys think in the comments. This was a wonderful project for me to pursue, and I really hope
6333720	6337800	everybody enjoyed it. Let me know what you think, if you have any thoughts, comments,
6337800	6343000	things to add, please remember to like and subscribe. I have a Patreon, I don't gatekeep
6343000	6347400	content, that's not what I do. Only support what you think the channel is worth, and I
