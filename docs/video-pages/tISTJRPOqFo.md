??? note "Description"
    Guys, today we will be conducting our first investigation into private sector companies with involvement in the UAP phenomena. Our first culprit, Battelle Memorial Institute, a non-profit, private company with a prolific history in all endeavors scientific - from Apollo 11 space travel to biological weapons. 
    
    Battelle has been deeply engrained with the study and cover-up of the UFO phenomena, dating all the way back to the 1950s when Battelle alongside the USG and USAF participated behind the scenes in creating a machine index to categorize UFO reports as well as playing their hand to quell public interest in the phenomena. 
    
    As mentioned by UFOlogist Jacques Vallee with a deep supporting paper trail, Battelle has also directly studied UAP material, likely a shape memory metallic alloy found at the 1947 Roswell Crash site, now commonly referred to as nitinol. 
    
    Join me on today's investigation as we connect the dots from Roswell to shadowy modern-day players pulling the strings of Sean Kirkpatrick to drive the UAP narrative!
