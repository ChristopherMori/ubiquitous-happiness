??? note "Description"
    A look into the Roswell before Roswell that was brought to the world's attention by David Grusch - the 1933 Magenta Italy UFO crash retrieval. This case has a tremendously fascinating story and rich lore dating back to the Fascist Regime of Benito Mussolini.
    
    Italian UFO Researcher Roberto Pinotti came into possession of official fascist internal documents in the late 90s that spelled out the story of the Magenta UAP collection. These documents included telegrams, memorandums, and handwritten notes that tell of the sophisticated disinformation tactics utilized to keep the UFO retrieval secret as well as the establishment of a scientific coalition codenamed the RS/33. This secret group tasked with the scientific study of the crashed OR landed UFO is strangely reminiscent of the alleged MJ12 documents that would appear decades later. 
    
    In addition to the Telegrams and memorandums highlighting the RS/33 involvement with the case, handwritten notes and official documents are included on Italian UFO sightings between 1933 and 1940; specifically a case of a cigar-shaped UAP followed by two flying saucers. Interestingly, these notes address Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law and suspected member of the RS/33.
    
    The conspiracy here deepens with allegations Pope Pius XXII informed the US of the craft's existence as well as the hiding of the craft within Mussolini's famous bunker under Mount Soratte.
    
    This video seeks to investigate the paper trail of the Magenta, Italy 1933 craft to investigate the full, and true story.
