??? note "Description"
    A detailed dive into the story and claims of Michael Herrera featuring the man who has been investigating Michael's case since the beginning; he goes by the pseudonym 'JJoeyisnotmyname'. Since investigating Michael's claims, Joey has formed a relationship with Michael and has gained access to many details of Michael's encounter and following experiences never before discussed. Today Joey and I will be breaking down the entirety of Michael's allegations as well as Joey's insights and experiences both investigating and speaking to Michael.

    So who is Michael Herrera and what does he claim? First appearing publically in the summer of 2023 and then being confirmed as a first-hand whistleblower in the AARO Historical Report Volume 1, Michael Herrera claims to have experienced a massive, 300-foot-long, octagonal UFO in the jungles of Indonesia while serving in the USMC. This operation was not NHI, but run by a rogue military force who seemingly operated a revere-engineered craft and performed human transportation in the earthquake-ravaged environment. 
    
    Following his 2023 public appearance on Steven Greer's Press Club panel, Michael claims to be approached by an "insider" who works in reverse engineering on NHI tech. This insider is allegedly pro-disclosure and wishes to trust Michael to leak small pieces of the USG black program's operations.
    
    Both the claims of witnessing the craft and meeting the insider seem wild and fantastical at first glance, but is there any truth or threads to pull on to validate the story of Michael Herrera and the underground UAP black group? Fortunately, Joey and myself sat down to take a critical lens and discuss the case top to bottom.
