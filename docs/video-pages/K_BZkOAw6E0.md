    Many commercial pilots throughout the history of aviation have witnessed UFOs,
    but unfortunately discussing their encounters has been historically taboo
    and met with the same cancerous stigma that meets all of ufology. Today I wanted
    to talk about the most famous UFO case in Spain, the Manisei incident, because what
    if I told you about a UFO sighting a pilot couldn't ignore? In fact this sighting
    was so prominent it led to the first ever commercial flight being grounded due
    to UFOs. Guys it is UAPGurb I am back to analyze some more of the most interesting
    UFO cases and encounters throughout history. Today the 1979 Manisei incident
    where the sighting of UFOs caused a commercial flight to be grounded and
    fighter jets to be scrambled. Now I'm going to use some of the original audio
    of this sighting from the actual pilots in this incident, but upon my search I
    found a channel called MPC Flight Recreations who actually incorporated
    the original audio with an edit of what this flight and encounter may have
    looked like. So I'm going to use some of his clips and I'm going to include his
    video link down in the video description. Highly recommend checking that video in
    his channel out because it's pretty cool. On November 11th 1979 pilot Javier
    Laredo de Tejeda was forced to make an emergency landing of his TAE Super
    Caravell and 109 passengers at the Manisei airport in Valencia Spain. This
    emergency landing was not due to mechanical failures or rowdy passengers
    but because of the pilots fear of colliding with a pair of strange red
    lights in the sky. Javier's flight departed the island of Malorca after a
    refueling stop for the craft's voyage from Salzburg Austria to La Palmas
    near 2247 hours. It's worth mentioning the other men in the cockpit of this
    Super Caravell, co-pilot Jose Ramón, Zouaza Nagore and flight mechanic
    Francisco Javier Rodriguez. At roughly 2305 hours over the Mediterranean the
    flight mechanic warned the crew of two visible powerful red lights to the front
    left of the airplane at an altitude of near 23,000 feet.
    The crew radioed to air traffic control in Barcelona to determine the source of
    the lights but were told there were no other aircraft on or near Captain Javier's
    flight path. The pair of red lights appear to draw closer to the aircraft.
    The men were able to discern the strange lights as two powerful sources of light
    with no visible solid body. When changing altitude to avoid any sort of collision
    with the lights the pair mirrored the craft's new trajectory and stayed less
    than half a mile to five miles away from the plane.
    If you have a new seat, can you tell me if the lights are on the sea or on the air?
    The craft's new traffic is close to normal for now.
    It's not moving at all now, it's 5-0, the traffic is going to be between 2-3-1-6.
    The vectoring of the lights towards the aircraft alongside the fact no other
    aircraft were operating in the area, Captain Javier aborted the flight and made an
    emergency landing at the Manisace Airport in Valencia.
    He rationalized flying near the UFO completely violating all aerial safety
    rules alongside the inability to make an evasive maneuver in the event of a
    collision was not worth the risk of his crew and 109 passengers. Just prior to the
    emergency landing, the crew detected three new UFO signals on radar, each with
    an estimated diameter of 200 meters. It's worth noting these lights were
    witnessed by Manisace Airport personnel as well as military personnel
    specifically Marines on the nearby Manisace Air Force Base. Due to one of these
    signatures passing close to the airport runways, emergency lights were lit by
    land crew if by some slim possibility, the UFO was actually an errant aircraft
    experiencing technical difficulties. Due to multiple sightings of these anomalous
    lights, Captain Fernando Camaro was soon dispatched from the nearby Lozianos Air
    Base in a Mirage F1 to identify the mysterious UFOs at 040 hours. Here, the
    pilot experienced equally or even more extraordinary events than that of crew
    TAE JK 297. Camaro was forced to increase his speed to 1.4 Mach or 1,074
    miles per hour just to make visual contact with an object he perceived as a
    truncated cone shape displaying a bright, changing color. Despite his efforts to
    approach the object, it quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was then informed of
    a new radar echo indicating another object may be near Segunto. The pilot took
    multiple pursuit vectors to approach the second object including traveling over
    the Mediterranean and the nearby Spanish inland territories just to have the object
    quickly dart away as he approached. Eventually, as Camaro neared the UFO, it
    seemingly responded, acknowledging his fighter jet. It was at this time the pilot
    had his avionics scrambled. The Mirage F1's electronic flight systems were jammed
    and the onboard alert system warned Camaro he was actively locked on by a
    continuous wave missile radar. The UFO then rapidly accelerated away towards
    mainland Africa. After nearly an hour and a half of pursuit and dangerously low on
    fuel, the pilot returned to base. This sighting took Spain by storm, reaching
    its parliament in September of 1980. After some representatives asked for an
    official explanation, it's unfortunate that the sighting was dismissed as a series
    of freak optical illusions. Okay, so let's review the facts of our case.
    TAE flight JK297 observed a set of red lights approaching their aircraft. After
    changing their altitude from 23,000 feet to avoid any collisions with the craft,
    the object matched the aircraft's trajectory and maintained a distance of 0.5
    to 5 miles. Due to safety concerns of the crew, the flight decides to perform an
    emergency landing. Shortly before the emergency landing, two more UFOs appear
    with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. One object flies close to the nearby
    airstrip so on-ground employees turn on emergency lighting in case a rogue aircraft
    is in trouble. Multiple marine air-based personnel witness strange moving
    lights in the sky. A Mirage F1 is dispatched to investigate and must travel
    1.4 Mach to even approach near the object. The pilot observes a conical shape
    before it rapidly accelerates out of sight. The pilot is ordered to pursue a
    second signature which, when close, actively scrambles his avionics equipment
    and onboard sensors. Please note that Kamara also states the object jammed
    his attempts to lock onto it with an IR missile. Now what stands out to me most
    about this case is not the crew aborting its flight path due to UFOs, but
    actually the sensory equipment failure of the Mirage F1. Believe me, this
    jamming has occurred multiple times in public UFO military cases. Everyone
    knows the story of Commander David Fravers' tic-tac sighting in 04 off the
    coast of San Diego. Did you know he says that the object's plural actively jam
    the radar and sensory equipment of the jets? And even more interesting, let's
    take a look at the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. This famous encounter details
    the experience of Major Parviz Jafari of the Imperial Iranian Air Force. In 1976
    he was one of two jets dispatched to intercept a UFO that had been detected
    hovering over Tehran in his F4 Phantom 2 jet. The first of the two pilots lost
    all instruments and communication abilities when approaching the object
    so he was forced to turn back. Ten minutes later, Jafari was scrambled to
    intercept the UFO. While traveling at Mach 1, the Major observed the object
    70 miles out, instantaneously jumped 10 degrees to his right. At this distance,
    the craft performed an instantaneous 26-mile jump in under a second. While
    approaching the seemingly diamond-shaped UFO, a smaller, spherical object
    separated from it and approached the F4 Phantom 2. Jafari's only instinct was
    to engage the smaller object with his weaponry, but when attempting to target
    the object, all of its instruments on board, including targeting and radio,
    went haywire. Frightening Jafari tremendously, he made the decision to
    emergency exit if the object approached within two miles of him. The pilot
    then performed evasive maneuvers to fly away from the object, where his
    instrumentation returned to normal and he regained contact with aerial command.
    This Tehran incident is one of my favorite encounters, and soon I'd like to
    make a video on global Air Force UFO encounters, but I just wanted to throw
    that in as another instance in which a military fighter jet experienced
    total instrument failure when engaging a UFO. Like with any credible sighting,
    with multiple eyewitnesses and multi-sensory data, we need to visit the
    Midwest-level debunk panel. So for this specific case, apparently the lights
    the Super Caravelle saw in 1979 were the lights of the combustion towers of
    the Escobrera refinery near Cartagena. This stationary lights do not account
    for the fact the trained pilots said that the lights approached their aircraft
    and maintained altitude while they performed evasive maneuvers and maintained
    a close distance the aircraft of 0.5 to 5 miles. Apparently these lights sent
    the captain into an anxiety attack, forcing him to land the plane and as
    well as the co-pilot and flight mechanic, they did not seem to argue with this
    rationale and they must have been inflicted with anxiety attacks as well.
    The moving lights that were seen by multiple menace airport personnel and
    nearby Marines, as well as the UFO that was seen near the airstrip, thus the
    emergency lighting was turned on in case there was a rogue aircraft, is apparently
    stars, planets, the same thing with every case. Everything just boils down to
    trained pilots and trained observers or people on the ground misconstruing
    Venus or Jupiter as a UFO, even though these lights are flashing multi-colored
    move or are a craft that are identifiable. The Mirage F1 explanation is both
    the most comical and most reasonable at the same time. At this time in 1979,
    the Iranian hostage crisis was being resolved and stationed near the
    Mediterranean was the US 6th Fleet. The scrambling of the instrumentation is said
    due to powerful electronic scrambling signatures on board to LHP to Iwo Jima
    helicopter carriers. However, pilot Fernando Kamara rejects this explanation stating
    that he was both too far away from this fleet to interfere with his flight
    navigation, radio, emergency control, so forth. And this doesn't account for the
    truncated cone shape that he witnessed with his own eyes as well as a craft that
    would speed away from him as he would approach it going 1.4 Mach. Furthermore,
    this explanation of the 6th Fleet does not explain the instance on which he
    tried to lock onto the UFO with an IR missile, where his systems were actively
    jammed. So to summarize that debunk panel, we have a confusion of stars. We have
    a refinery tower that a trained pilot gets an anxiety attack and must land his
    plane. And we have a pilot who is seen in a mirage with his own eyes and his jet.
    And it's just a US fleet. That's who knows how nearby. So to me at least that
    debunk panel doesn't hold up. I think that's a lot of coincidences at once that
    just does not stand up to me. I think this case is incredibly interesting and I
    think it is one of the world's most interesting cases. And it is, no matter how
    you look at it, true or false, the first recorded story of a commercial airliner
    being grounded due to a sighting of a UFO. But what do you think on this case?
    Have you heard about this case? Because it flies kind of under the radar to me,
    but it is Spain's most famous UFO case. If you've heard of it, let me know when
    did you hear about it? What do you think about it? If you haven't, what do you think
    about it? Think it's real? Or do you think it's fake? Or do you think it's an
    anxiety attack by a pilot and multiple eyewitnesses being confused? And I guess
    the similarities between that and the 1976 Tehran incident with the Mirage jet
    are just bad a coincidence. But I'll be fully transparent. I think this case is legitimate.
    Thank you guys and I hope you enjoyed this short documentary, another one. I know
    we're supposed to be on our iceberg part three and that will become and I just
    have been struck with some inspiration lately to make some of these documentary
    cases. I think they're fascinating. I have a ton more. I want to make a sort of
    global Air Force UFO encounter video pretty soon. I have some interesting cases
    from the U.S. Peru as well and all over the world. So stay tuned. Let me know in
    the comments what kind of video you want to see next. Like and subscribe to the
    channel and I'll catch you guys next time.
