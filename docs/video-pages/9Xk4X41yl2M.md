??? note "Description"
    Volume 2 of a new series analyzing UFO whistleblowers throughout history where I will review the claims and credibility of the most interesting claims surrounding the UAP phenomenon. These whistleblowers can be of ironclad reputation like David Grusch, bound by legal testimony like Robert Salas, or have interesting stories with no real evidence like Bob Lazar.
    
    Today's video focuses on 3 sets of claims - Harland Bentley who claimed to have observed a UFO crash in Maryland, Senator Barry Goldwater who was denied access to the "Blue Room" of Wright Patterson AFB, and the enigmatic Marine RB who claimed to have guarded a nonhuman vehicle in 1963.
    
    Bentley's background, at least in public realms, is nonverifiable but his claims of a UAP crash near a Nike Ajax Missile in Maryland as well as the crew of Apollo 8 encountering a craft on their way to Apollo 8 carry some astounding parallel research. 
    
    Goldwater famously was denied access to the "blue room" of WPAFB where UAP material was stored by General Curtis Lemay. This statement is powerful, especially with the intrigue of non-human technology surrounding WPAFB at this time, the connections of Lemay to UFO, as well as FOIA requests on destroyed Blue Room documentation.
    
    RB's story has no verifiable elements as of this video but it is compelling and fantastic. The marine who claimed to guard a UAP for 2 weeks offers astonishing detail into the craft's makeup as well as scientific and military practices around the craft.
