??? note "Description"
    A Deep dive into the U.S. Navy and UFO Legacy Programs. This investigation aims to analyze the US Navy and it's major departments - Office of Naval Intelligence and Office of Naval Research and UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs in conjunction with U.S. Intelligence agencies, including the joint Navy CIA National Underwater Reconnasiance Office. 
    
    The project explores September 2024 reporting by journalist Christopher Sharp and the Liberation Times detailing Naval underwater UFO recovery programs operating alongside the CIA, intelligence agencies, and private entities such as Lockheed Martin and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
    
    Additionally, this program seeks to evaluate the National Underwater Reconnaisance Office (NURO), Navy Special Program Office (NSP), and outstanding statements on UFO recovery programs made by senior Naval officials such as Bobby Ray Inman, Sumner Shaprio, and Nat Kobitz. Analysis into such programs draws attention to the 1960s and the Deep Submergence Systems Project and a possible clandestine, compartmented program tasked with retrieving UFOs from the sea floor - Sand Dollar.
    
    Utilizing this information as well as historical testimony of craft stored at various naval facilities and a 1991 deep sea UFO triangle recovery in the Northen Atlantic, this investigation theorizes Naval UFO legacy operations engage in 4 major categories:
    
    Monitor, Collect, Store, and exploit.
