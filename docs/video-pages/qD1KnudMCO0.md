    Guys, I wanted to try and perform a critical analysis on one of my favorite alleged pieces of UFO footage - the FLYBY footage. This film of a UFO traveling near the wing of an F/A-18 Super Hornet first mysteriously appeared in 2008 and has BAFFLED me since I first discovered it around 2015.
    
    The footage depicts a saucer-shaped UFO flying directly off the wing type of the jet and displays 3 of the 5 characteristics of Lue Elizondo's UAP characteristics:
    1. No visible means of propulsion
    2. Instant Acceleration
    3. Antigravity
    
    If true, this footage is hands down the BEST available UFO footage in the public realm! But is it?.... We will analyze the footage context, sound, craft shape, and a mysterious document that sends us down a rabbit hole I never would've thought existed when I began covering this case! 
    
    Please enjoy my breakdown of the FLYBY footage!
