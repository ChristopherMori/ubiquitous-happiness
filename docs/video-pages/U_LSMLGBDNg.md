??? note "Description"
    Analyzing the astonishing testimony of witness 11063 designated as "ED" within the files of Dr. Steven Greer. Witness Ed served a long and eventful Career within the US Air Froce, Retiring as a Lt. Col. after serving at Nellis AFB, Edwards AFB, Hanscom AFB, and the Pentagon.
    
    Ed claims while stationed at Nellis, he was briefed on UFO reverse engineering programs existing at Area 51 S4. Following his station at Nellis, Ed would attend the USAF test pilot school at Edwards AFB before serving as a test director for an Electronic Warfare Group dealing directly with non-human intelligence reverse-engineered technology.
    
    Evaluating the witness testimony of Ed, conclusions can be drawn on the existence of a joint reverse engineering program focused on the craft of non-human intelligence operating between Nellis and Edwards AFBs. The program exists out of the 412th Test Group which operates both the Edwards test pilot school and Edwards Electronic Warfare Group. This program sees operations on the grounds of Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range and involves defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin.
