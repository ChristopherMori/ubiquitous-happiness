??? note "Description"
    A deep dive into the Northrop Grumman Corporation and their alleged involvement in UAP legacy reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs. Alongside high-profile defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and SAIC, Northrop has historically been implicated as one of THE premier US defense contractors possessing non-human vehicles and technology. 
    
    This project will analyze numerous acquisitions conducted by Northrop over the decades, such as TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM, etc, study alleged Northrop UAP program locations, and dissect whistleblower testimony surrounding the corporation and their UAP operations.
    
    Does Northrop operate TUO (technologies of unknown origin) material exploitation and UFO crash retrieval teams? Let's try and find out....

## Transcript
??? info "Show transcript"
    The propulsion of these UFOs is unique,
    their ability to hover,
    their ability to accelerate very rapidly,
    their ability to move at very high speeds,
    very much higher than anything that we have achieved,
    even with our supersonic aircraft.
    All of these things, and particularly interestingly,
    without sonic booms and the things that we don't
    like about our supersonic aircraft,
    all of these things indicate a type of propulsion,
    which is unique.
    Different than anything we know anything about,
    and which would be a tremendous value
    if we could develop it and use it.
    That's the reason I feel with a number of others
    who have studied it, that it is a subject
    which deserves the highest type of scientific study
    and at an early date.
    The advantages to be gained are perfectly enormous.
    And how long do you feel it will be
    before we are flying in UFOs?
    Well, this probably is a $64 question
    without a question without.
    I think it depends, a great deal,
    on how rapidly we take them seriously
    and how soon we really set up
    a scientific study team to work on the subject.
    This is where we push the laws of physics.
    You see, the technology we make
    is what makes the impossible possible.
    And it doesn't stop there.
    So far on this channel,
    we have devoted entire investigations
    towards Battelle Memorial Institute
    and their possible work on shape memory alloys
    recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,
    as well as Lockheed Martin
    and their intimate decades long involvement
    in UFO legacy programs.
    After all, high profile US defense contractors
    have for decades been accused of actively engaging
    in material exploitation
    and reverse engineering programs,
    focused on technologies of unknown origin
    in conjunction with various factions
    within US government intelligence and military.
    Overall, you know, the government
    has been the custodian of a lot of this, right?
    And they'll hand recede it out
    to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,
    which I find highly unethical.
    You have basically a sole source arrangement
    and you allow certain private corporate elements
    to look at this, develop a potential insight
    and then sell it back to the government for profit.
    And I think that's totally unethical.
    Lockheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work,
    both in our atmosphere, in space, and even underwater.
    There are certain efforts to...
    It's a tough question you ask.
    I left the Air Force and was sent out to California
    at that time to begin establishing my cover basis
    as an independent contractor
    so that I can serve what was coming down the line next for me.
    And that is the path which led to the UAP subject.
    These claims are not without merit
    as since the inception
    of the US military industrial complex,
    private defense industry has worked in tandem
    with military and intelligence
    to bolster US military might
    protected by waived, unacknowledged special access programs.
    I have directly accused Lockheed Martin,
    Patel, Boeing, SAIC, and many other private institutions
    and semi-private institutions,
    such as UARCs and FFRDCs possessing, experimenting with
    and possibly successfully harnessing
    non-human technologies.
    Today, we focus our sights towards the US Aerospace
    and Defense Colossus and father of the B-2 stealth bomber,
    Northrop Grumman, often overshadowed
    by the infamy of Lockheed
    and their involvement in the 2008 failed attempt
    to divest recovered NHI materials to the OSAP program.
    Northrop Grumman has largely successfully distanced itself
    from the spotlight of defense contractors
    engaging with UAP legacy programs.
    In fact, focused discussion
    on the alien reproduction vehicle, Fluxliner,
    as relayed by Brad Sorensen
    and the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle
    discussed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
    seemed to primarily focus on Lockheed.
    These testimonies highlight the defense contractor
    successfully reverse engineering non-human craft
    to operate under human control.
    But throughout such disclosures,
    Lockheed isn't the sole contractor accused
    of such highly classified efforts.
    Hardly mentioned, but always alongside in the shadows
    is Northrop Grumman.
    Could Northrop Grumman truly be involved
    in material exploitation of technologies
    of unknown origin, TUOs?
    Just how far does their involvement with UFO studies go?
    Join me today as we peer into the shadows to find out.
    Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb
    and thank you so much for joining me
    as we touch back to UFOs in the private sector.
    This time to Northrop Grumman.
    The contractor I believe alongside Lockheed
    is the Paramount Aerospace Corporation
    entrenched in UFO legacy programs.
    From whistleblower testimony to analysis
    of Northrop's numerous acquisitions over the decades,
    let's thoroughly dive into the legendary Northrop Grumman
    and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.
    Let's start by analyzing the history of Northrop
    and its many, many, many acquisitions over the decades.
    Northrop Grumman is an American aerospace
    and defense company employing over 95,000 employees
    with an annual revenue of $30 billion.
    The industry giant has achieved extraordinary engineering
    feat such as aiding in the development
    of the James Webb Space Telescope
    and directly creating the B-2 Spirit Bomber and B-21 Raider,
    the world's only known stealth bombers.
    Northrop Grumman operates in four major divisions,
    aeronautics, defense, space and mission systems,
    outside of military aircraft,
    space systems and weapon development.
    Northrop also engages in cyber security,
    information technology and radar and sensor systems.
    Briefly, I do take an extreme interest
    in Northrop's C-4 ISR, Command Control,
    Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
    Surveillance and Reconnaissance,
    which falls under Northrop's land-based
    critical technology services,
    sustainment and modernization.
    C-4 ISR is essentially the military's nervous system
    consisting of various electronic equipment and technologies
    serving to aid the modern warfighter
    through data and intelligence.
    I am currently working on a thesis
    that select contractor C-4 ISR programs
    engage in deep-six waved USAPs for crash retrieval
    and ARV testing, data and analysis, let me explain.
    Northrop was one of the premier contractors
    operating C-4 ISR for the Strategic Defense Initiative
    instituted under Reagan in 1983.
    Northrop created the first laser radar
    used in space for SDI.
    I have discussed numerous times lines of research
    which state SDI focused on Soviet ICBM nuclear defense,
    secretly studied and employed offensive capabilities
    against UAP and siphoned program funds
    to UAP legacy programs such as the DARS,
    Defense Advanced Research Center,
    proposed to exist in an ARPA document.
    SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation,
    frequently secures massive hundreds of million dollar
    contracts for C-4 ISR
    at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
    I have published extensive research,
    SAIC runs an off-world technologies division
    to house recovered NHI artifacts at the Crane Naval location.
    When discussing witness Ed in the existence
    of a joint ARV testing program
    out of Edwards Air Force Base in Area 51
    under the Edwards 412 test group,
    I made reference to a Lockheed Martin ISR case study.
    In this study, Lockheed was tasked
    with updating the system used by USAF Warfare Center
    for Intelligence Collection and Data Processing.
    Lockheed reconfigured a two phase security classification
    system used by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
    Yes, the same agency Grush was a part of
    when liaison to the UAP task force
    and the same agency recently mentioned
    by respected journalist Chris Sharp
    as participating in undersea UAP crash retrievals.
    The system was implemented to the combined air
    and space operation center at Nellis Air Force Base,
    which is tasked with processing information
    for exploitation of time sensitive targets.
    At the time I speculated,
    although this Lockheed project arose from challenges
    in the Nellis Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training Exercise,
    could such systems be used to monitor UAP
    and UAP crash retrievals?
    Although C4 ISR is common
    and the nervous system of the armed forces,
    I do think analyzing Defense Corporation's
    C4 ISR contracts and projects with USAF Army
    and Navy can lead to knocking on the door
    of UAP program operations.
    And after that long discussion,
    finally back to the history of Northrop Grumman.
    NG arose from the merging of two military aircraft companies,
    the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Company
    and the Northrop Company in 1994.
    Throughout its storied history,
    Northrop made a few very key acquisitions.
    We will continue to reference over and over
    again throughout this project.
    One such acquisition occurred in 1999
    with procurement of Teledyne Ryan,
    developer of surveillance systems at unmanned aircraft.
    In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc,
    a corporation involved in aerospace, electronics
    and the automotive industries.
    Outside of computers, systems engineering,
    integrated circuits, TRW was a true trailblazer
    in spacecraft construction,
    building pioneer one, 10 and numerous
    space-based observatories.
    The defense giant considered TRW,
    its quote unquote capstone acquisition
    signaling the end to Northrop Grumman's
    aggressive purchasing streak.
    Why was TRW considered the crown jewel
    of Northrop's purchases?
    While there is evidence to suggest
    this was due to TRW operating a portfolio
    of UAP legacy programs upon purchase.
    Lengthy investigation must be done
    to discover the UFO program portfolio
    Northrop may have inherited from TRW.
    TRW has long been associated
    with a rumored crash retrieval program
    run out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
    a topic even touched on by Lou Elizondo
    in his book Eminent.
    And let's mention that in June of 1960,
    TRW spawned the Aerospace Corporation.
    The Aerospace Corporation has additionally
    been implicated in UFO legacy programs
    and served as a place for employment
    for OSAP physicist and member
    of the Wilson Davis meeting Dr. Eric Davis.
    I would additionally like to draw attention
    to the year the Aerospace Corporation was founded in 1960
    and relate this founding to the testimony
    of Lieutenant Colonel Philip J. Corso.
    Corso stated 1958 to 1962 oversaw
    the golden age of U.S. Army R&D
    where Army assets, universities, laboratories,
    and private industry were leveraged
    to reverse engineer non-human technology
    to bolster the U.S. war machine.
    Analyzing Army primers from around this time
    highlight a period of massive innovation
    in Army research and development.
    The MITRE Corporation was born during this time in 1959
    with lines of research to suggest its formation
    was to engage in such research and development projects
    alongside Bell Labs, Sperry Rand, et cetera.
    The Aerospace Corporation founded just one year post-MITRE,
    maybe one additional corporation spawned from TRW
    for U.S. Army legacy operations.
    And worthy to note, both MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation
    are both known as FFRDCs,
    federally funded research and development centers.
    Present day, the Aerospace Corporation manages
    the Aerospace FFRDC for the Department of Defense
    and Air Force to support, quote,
    national security space programs, end quote.
    We are truly the only space enterprise
    that exists in the United States.
    And I mean this at the agency level in the government,
    the FFRDCs in private industry.
    There is no other organization
    that does national security space, civil and commercial,
    and international as well,
    that ties these all together with both the breadth
    and the depth that we bring to this problem.
    I have spoken at length about FFRDCs,
    semi-private institutions
    that play a crucial hand in UAP legacy programs.
    I recommend any of my previous four investigations
    to hear more on the subject.
    It is intriguing, Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo,
    all but admitted the Aerospace Corporation
    built from TRW is actively involved
    in UAP legacy programs.
    And that up to that point,
    TRW had been a primary contractor in such UFO programs.
    So all this talk about private contractors,
    you know, the big Lockheed Martin,
    what about federally funded research and development centers,
    such as MITRE, RAND, TRIAD, Oak Ridge, and UARC,
    so university affiliated research centers,
    where do they fall into this?
    Only one, and I won't name it.
    It started out as a contractor in 1960,
    starting not too long after it was born.
    It was actually a spinoff of TRW.
    So TRW was the principal investigator for the first
    roughly what, almost 30, yeah, practically, well, 29 years.
    Before we keep discussing TRW,
    let's highlight a former U.S. Premier Electronics Manufacturer
    implicated in TUO exploitation
    by Lieutenant Colonel Corsa with possible ties to MITRE
    and the Aerospace Corporation,
    this being the company I just mentioned above,
    the Sparey RAND Corporation.
    In his manuscript, Corsa would reference
    the personal memoirs of Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau,
    Chief of U.S. Army R&D
    and Founder of the Army's Foreign Technology Division,
    and how Trudeau would engage in frequent meetings
    with Sparey RAND's board,
    including legendary General Douglas MacArthur.
    Sparey RAND went defunct in 1986
    and its former divisions became part of Lockheed Martin,
    Raytheon, Honeywell, and you guessed it, Northrop Grumman,
    all companies implicated in UFO legacy programs.
    But let's get back to TRW.
    TRW features some familiar faces of this channel
    many will recognize.
    Remember if you will, Dr. Eric Walker,
    the scientist named by physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher
    as participating in UFO crash retrieval meetings
    alongside Vannefar Bush in the 1950s.
    Walker started Penn State's
    University Affiliated Research Center,
    self-admitted he knew about the Majestic 12
    and was present at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.
    I have always talked about how Walker
    is one of the most crucial names in UFO crash retrieval
    and reverse engineering programs in the 1950s and 1960s.
    Much intrigues me about Walker,
    including his position as former chairman of TRW.
    TRW has also been discussed at length
    by respected researchers such as Richard Dolan
    as the primary contractor running a crash retrieval program
    under the project named Zodiac.
    Project Zodiac, an MJ-12-like entity,
    is not our subject today.
    However, we may discuss it soon
    as the story of Zodiac by pseudonym Sedge Masters
    is utterly captivating.
    And with TRW, we may just have a paper trail
    to connect them and Northrop to legacy operations.
    In 2004, former assistant secretary
    of housing and urban development,
    Catherine Austin Fitz, wrote a paper called
    The Black Budget of the United States.
    This paper stated a large portion of the nation's wealth
    had ongoing leave and illegally diverted
    into secret, unaccountable channels
    to support clandestine military research and development.
    Some to a majority of which had been suggested
    to be UAP-related.
    While at the HUD department,
    Fitz came across information
    various high-profile defense contractors accounting systems
    were responsible for scrubbing and obfuscating
    the direction of these funds.
    Although a 1990 federal law mandated
    every single U.S. government agency be audited,
    the Pentagon never publicly faced a comprehensive audit
    until one was launched in December of 2017.
    And not to mention since,
    the Pentagon has never passed an audit.
    And this 2017 audit may have happened solely due
    to another Catherine Austin Fitz University paper
    detailing $21 trillion in unauthorized spending
    in the DOD and Department of Housing
    and Urban Development from 1998 to 2015.
    In the Wilson Davis memo,
    which I have talked about so many times,
    Admiral Thomas Wilson relates to Dr. Eric Davis,
    the watch committee,
    the gatekeepers of the UAP legacy program portfolio,
    told Wilson they are organized after an audit
    in the 1990s almost blew their cover.
    What this means is essentially a failed audit
    led to UAP programs being reorganized
    under the special access program oversight committee,
    senior review group.
    Here is where we circle back.
    In 2003, Northrop Grumman settled a lawsuit
    from the U.S. government for $111 million,
    almost $200 million today.
    This settlement was due to Northrop subsidiary TRW,
    overcharging for government work done on space projects
    in the early 1990s.
    This suggests TRW's inflated space project contracts
    were implicated and uncovered in the failed audit
    mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo
    that took place in the 1990s.
    Timelines indeed match up as the beginning roots
    of this lawsuit can be traced back to 1994.
    TRW's likely involvement with UAP legacy
    waived unacknowledged special access programs
    appeared as contract overcharging
    to the wider DOD auditing officials,
    leading to the lawsuit against TRW
    settled by Northrop, utterly fascinating.
    If this hypothesis is accurate,
    Northrop settled the suit and reorganized their UAP portfolio
    under the SAPOX Senior Review Group program reorganization
    that was relayed to Wilson.
    To make Northrop's purchase of TRW even more interesting,
    shortly before Northrop bought TRW in 2002,
    TRW had purchased BDM, Braddock Dunn and McDonald in 1997.
    BDM was a technical services firm
    that headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas,
    White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico,
    and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.
    BDM specialized in and worked primarily
    with missile guidance, application optics,
    electronic instrumentation, and radiation physics.
    BDM was also founded in 1959,
    around the same time as MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation.
    BDM was mentioned specifically by Commander Will Miller
    of the Wilson Davis Memo in the year 2000.
    The former U.S. Navy commander
    stated numerous government individuals
    such as Defense Intelligence Agency directors
    who in this case would have been Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson
    were isolated from UAP knowledge.
    The quote-unquote keepers of the secrets
    resided in DOD middle management and civilian contractors
    like Boeing, Lockheed, and BDM.
    To learn more about Miller
    and why his words carry weight,
    I highly recommend watching my video
    on the Wilson Davis Memo.
    Sure, it's my first video and it's very amateurish,
    but there's still some good information there.
    BDM could warrant its own video,
    but for now, I leave you with this.
    Just like FFRDCs, I have talked ad nauseam
    of Major General Albert Stubblebine
    and how his department, U.S. Army INSCOM
    and their previous Special Forces Unit,
    the Intelligence Support Activity,
    have been historically involved with UAP crash retrieval.
    In 1984, Stubblebine was replaced as head of INSCOM
    and went on to serve as vice president for BDM.
    The following year in 1985,
    BDM would host an advanced theoretical physics conference
    to discuss UFO reverse engineering opportunities.
    And actually, let's not stop there with BDM.
    In 1989, NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler
    was introduced to retired rear admiral Sumner Shapiro
    from Bobby Ray Inman.
    Inman was then board member of SAIC and Wackenhut
    and former NSA director and CIA deputy director.
    I have reason to believe Inman engaged with UAP programs
    in each of these four positions,
    but that is not our topic for today.
    Shapiro told Eschler factions within the U.S.
    possess extraterrestrial vehicles
    and that he had even studied one at close quarters.
    According to Shapiro, teams would take apart craft,
    pack them up and ship them across the country
    to different locations.
    These craft featured unique interlocking components
    that had to be dissembled in an exact sequence
    to be put back together.
    Rear admiral Shapiro was not only
    former director of naval intelligence,
    but also BDM international board member at the time, 1989.
    To this day, Northrop Grumman maintains
    a major corporate presence in Tyson Corner
    near the former BDM headquarters.
    All of this commentary on TRW, Teledyne Ryan,
    which we will get to shortly in BDM,
    served to highlight how Northrop Grumman
    and its many acquisitions interweave intimately
    with numerous cases we have covered on this channel.
    If the claims of Philip J. Corso are indeed true,
    Northrop's modern day legacy program operations
    can likely trace its roots back to the US Army's
    golden age of research and development in 1958 to 1962.
    This would also mean many of Northrop Corporation
    and Northrop Grumman's acquisitions
    were to purchase companies that had active,
    ongoing UFO legacy programs.
    This sort of context is crucial to establish
    before we explore whistleblower claims
    of Northrop's operations in these programs.
    And last thing before we continue,
    many individuals think of Lockheed Skunkworks Division
    when they picture UFO reverse engineering
    and material exploitation programs in the private sector.
    Well, in 1992, Northrop created its own
    quote unquote answer to Skunkworks.
    Northrop created the NATDC,
    Northrop Advanced Technology and Design Center
    to focus on the company's core key defense programs.
    While we have already discussed many of NG's acquisitions
    and their ties to UFO legacy programs
    from the 1960s to 1990s,
    let's back up and trace mentions
    and claims surrounding specifically
    the Northrop Corporation and later Northrop Grumman.
    I often think back to the words of US Army Colonel
    and advisor to US Army Futures Command, Carl Nell,
    who once stated,
    Non-human intelligence exists.
    Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity.
    This interaction is not new and it's been ongoing.
    And there are unelected people in the government
    that are aware of that.
    And so, Carl, that is quite a bold statement.
    I'm wondering and I'm curious,
    how confident are you that that is true?
    There's zero doubt.
    Nell has served as an outspoken advocate for David Grush
    and the existence of technologies of unknown origin.
    One has to wonder if this absence of doubt
    arose from Nell's position as Deputy CTO
    and Director of Systems Engineering and Integration
    for 13 years on Northrop Grumman.
    After all, while serving as Northrop's Deputy CTO,
    Nell was additionally serving as Command Representative
    to US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Service,
    US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Material Program.
    Northrop's earliest contributions to legacy programs
    may trace back to 1968.
    MS Can and GM Andrew of Northrop Northair
    published a paper on the electro aerodynamics
    in supersonic flow, suggesting Northrop was researching
    methods to reduce drag of an aircraft
    by creating an electrostatic field around the craft.
    This may remind some of T. Townsend-Brown and electro-gravidics.
    In Nick Cook's excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point,
    one Dan Marcus is mentioned, a pseudonym for a source
    in the British aerospace industry.
    Marcus relayed to Cook that in 2002,
    the Pentagon pulled the specific paper and, quote,
    made it disappear, end quote.
    Marcus would suggest the B-2 Spirit Bomber
    applied these concepts to employ an electrostatic field
    around the aircraft to reduce drag.
    In fact, some UFO researchers such as Michael Schrap
    and Dr. Richard Boylan take this a step further,
    suggesting the B-2 employs reverse engineered
    possibly electro-gravidic technology,
    leading to the massive cost of the systems.
    The question is, and Mark talked about this before,
    is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye?
    Aviation Week Space Technology, March 9, 1992,
    had a very interesting article from people
    who worked at Northrop who were very upset
    that the technology associated with the B-2 program
    was not being trickled down to the public industry.
    They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges
    the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature.
    That's what you see in this diagram right here.
    And then negatively charges the exhaust gases
    to reduce the infrared signature.
    This is the same type of electro-gravidic technology
    that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s.
    So this technology might date back a lot earlier
    than we originally thought.
    The first true mention of Northrop engaging with NHI technology
    comes from the work of UFO researcher William Hamilton.
    Hamilton's book, Cosmic Top Secret,
    is in my opinion the most underappreciated book
    in all of ufology.
    It is a truly excellent piece, decades ahead of its time.
    For example, the 1992 book makes the first recorded mention
    of the term ARV and discussion of the Fluxliner,
    which wouldn't rise to fame until Stephen Greer's
    2001 disclosure project event.
    Mind you, Hamilton did misquote the ARV acronym
    stating Alien Replicated Vehicle instead of Alien Reproduction Vehicle.
    However, my research has shown Hamilton spoke to Bill Scott
    of Aviation Week in Space Technology
    to discuss the Brad Sorenson Fluxliner testimony
    in the early 90s.
    The next time someone tries to say Stephen Greer
    coined the term ARV, send them this passage.
    And Hamilton actually told Greer about the 1988
    Norton Air Force Base Show Fluxliner incident
    and actually passed along both primary witness Sorenson
    and aerospace illustrator McCandlish to Greer.
    Hamilton was one of the first to draw serious research
    to the Antelope Valley, California, near Edwards Air Force Base.
    Hamilton drew attention to Lockheed's Gunkworks, Rockwell,
    McDonnell Douglas, and Northrop, all having plants
    in Palmdale, California.
    The nation's then chief center of aerospace technology
    in the middle of these complexes sat Air Force Plant 42,
    a name many associate with UAP programs.
    The author of Cosmic Top Secret does not draw attention
    to the Northrop facility near Palmdale,
    but instead to a secret underground installation
    north in the Tujachepe Mountains.
    Hamilton accuses the Northrop-Tahan Ranch Radar Cross-Section Facility
    and accompanying underground installation as a UAP program facility.
    Very little is known about this facility and the underground extension,
    but let's see what we can dig up.
    This site officially serves as a radar cross-section range.
    Quickly, what exactly is a radar cross-section facility?
    To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves
    to test aircraft radar signatures.
    The sites utilize large runways and pylons
    raised from underground on concrete diamonds
    as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.
    Many RCS facilities saw construction during the Cold War.
    This led the majority of installations being built underground
    to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies
    away from Soviet spy satellites.
    In Cosmic Top Secret, William Hamilton discussed numerous statements
    recounted to him, such as a 1988 sighting of a giant boomerang
    over the Northrop facility and a flying saucer
    seen taking off from a building on the property.
    The Northrop RCS facility has recorded several anomalous sightings throughout history,
    oftentimes glowing orbs seen around the facility.
    According to some researchers,
    the facility sees a disproportionate amount of sightings
    compared to the Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities nearby.
    And this isn't the first time I've discussed this Northrop location.
    Remember back to my work on the Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle,
    the XF-131 Super Sentinel.
    Let's reference forensic artist Bill McDonald's 1992 piece,
    the Tuhachibi Triangle,
    in which the artist drew a reverse-engineered triangular craft
    detailed to him by disgruntled engineers from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
    The engineers hailed from the Northrop RCS facility at Tehan
    and Lockheed Martin-Hellendale RCS plant.
    According to their testimonies,
    the facilities doubled as UFO reverse engineering
    and material exploitation locations.
    If you have not seen this investigation,
    I highly recommend watching as the XF-131 Super Sentinel
    is absolutely fascinating research.
    And RCS locations have actually seen much discussion in ufology.
    With the contentious Steven Greer in particular,
    labeling the Hellendale plant as a staging ground for electro-gravitic ARV,
    and a forward operating base employing EMP weapons for ARV testing
    and downing of non-human vehicles.
    Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee
    and other senior officials had no idea of this.
    The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system
    didn't know about it.
    I had known about it since the 90s,
    but I'd never of course flown directly over it
    because it's classified airspace and very sensitive.
    So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.
    It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building
    since the 1954-55 come out.
    They go up and they hover, they're silent,
    they're electro-gravitic, anti-grab.
    The diamond on the left, you see that it looks like a runway with a diamond?
    It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get,
    there's not an aerodynamic, they just go boom up.
    But they're placed over different diamonds.
    I have a whole series of video and pictures of these
    who don't have time to go through.
    And that's where they're put at various elevations
    and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon
    to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict.
    Now this may seem extreme,
    but there is quite a bit of valid research
    to discuss weapons that have been designed to down UAP.
    But what more can we factually learn about the underground portion
    of the Tehan RCS facility?
    The Northrop site would then be discussed
    in Dr. Richard Sodder's excellent book,
    Underground Bases and Tunnels,
    which takes an evidence-based approach
    to studying subterranean facilities,
    aka deep underground military bases, DUMMS.
    This is my absolute favorite book on the subject of DUMMS
    as Sodder tackles the subject often associated with conspiracies
    with rigorous fact-based research.
    Sodder states Northrop alongside numerous Fortune 500 companies
    such as Lockheed Martin employ high-tech underground centers
    in California and claims with a high degree of certainty
    these facilities are, quote,
    equally engaged in non-conventional high-tech aerospace research,
    end quote.
    Dr. Sodder is equally confident the underground portion
    of the Northrop RCS facility engages
    in the same non-conventional research,
    but is unsure just how far beneath the Earth
    Northrop's activities extend.
    Rumors persist under the site there exist as many
    as 42 underground levels and connective tunnels
    to nearby facilities as well as Edwards Air Force Base.
    The validity and very real existence of these locations
    and tunnels will be another topic for another day
    as there is quite a volume of valuable research
    to speak to the legitimacy of interconnected
    deep underground military bases.
    Because yes, I do plan on using Dr. Sodder's research
    for a full deep dive into DUMMS.
    But I would just like to say that TRW,
    Northrop's golden child, also has a storied history
    in connected subterranean facilities.
    In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    and U.S. National Committee on Tunneling Technology,
    USNC slash TT, conducted myriad studies, reports,
    and patents on underground ICBM-based design,
    tunneling technologies, tunnel boring machines,
    tunnel depths, et cetera.
    TRW engaged and published a number of studies
    determining the viability of high-speed
    ground transportation tunnel design.
    For example, we can analyze this 1968 report
    where TRW discusses high-speed underground
    transportation vehicles in tunnel diameters
    ranging from 80 to 40 feet.
    At a depth of 400 to 2,500 feet.
    Another topic for another day, as I stated.
    Analyzing McDonald, Sodder, and Hamilton,
    the question must be asked,
    does Northrop Grumman test and operate
    reverse engineered NHI vehicles?
    Out of an underground facility beneath the Tehan RCS site,
    the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS locations
    do, after all, reside in close proximity to
    Edwards Air Force Base, the former Norton Air Force Base,
    and Palmdale, USAF Plant 42.
    Norton and Plant 42 are integral pieces
    to the Fluxliner ARV testimony of Brad Sorensen
    and Mark McCandlish.
    And carefully connecting research
    and analyzing the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Ed,
    I have accused Edwards Air Force Base
    and their 412th test group,
    as running a UFO reverse engineering testing program
    between Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range.
    Several testimonies over the decades,
    outside of Echler, Miller, and McDonald's
    four anonymous engineers have labeled
    Northrop Grumman directly,
    as participating in UFO crash retrieval,
    reverse engineering, and material exploitation.
    Many will recall the testimony of Edgar Fouchet
    and the TR-3B reverse engineer triangular craft.
    Many write off Fouchet due to the absence
    of hard physical proof of his claims.
    However, I do highly recommend viewing my piece
    on triangle ARVs in general,
    as a tremendous amount of research
    resulted from Fouchet's disclosures.
    The 250 foot prototype and 600 foot operational
    TR-3B models according to Fouchet
    saw test flights over Edwards Air Force Base,
    conducted by the AFFTC Air Force Test Center,
    which oddly enough operates under the 412th test group
    which we discussed above.
    Strange as near Edwards, where these test flights
    allegedly occur, Northrop has nearby installations,
    both near Palmdale, USAF Plant 42,
    as well as a mysterious underground location
    where anomalous craft have been reported
    over the decades.
    Fouchet also outright named the contractors
    responsible for the construction of TR-3B.
    FFRDC's Sandia and Livermore Labs
    reverse engineer the propulsion device.
    But the primary contractors of the project
    were listed as Lockheed, Boeing,
    Teledyne Ryan, and Northrop.
    I would now like to shift to a fascinating few details
    from the whistleblower testimony of Colonel Steve Wilson.
    Wilson's testimony was made public around 1997,
    shortly before his death,
    through researcher Dr. Richard Boylan.
    Boylan has historically published some claims
    I approach with skepticism,
    so I tried multiple times to connect with him
    regarding Wilson, but have heard nothing.
    Colonel Steve Wilson does deserve his own video
    as this enigmatic figure is well worth investigating.
    And disclaimer, we cannot 100% prove Wilson's
    40-year military background,
    as numerous articles exist on the web detailing
    his DD-214 in education, training, and medals.
    However, we do not have any scans or copies
    of Wilson's official records or images of him in service.
    For this reason, I do also recommend reading
    Kevin Randall's skeptical take on Wilson
    and Boylan's reporting, which raises concerns,
    such as 40 years of service listed on Wilson's DD-214,
    as well as seemingly misreported medals.
    To summarize Wilson's disclosures,
    Wilson claimed in 1963 as a captain in the tactical
    fighter squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
    He was assigned to the Majestic 12 and promoted to Major.
    Here, the then Major learned of the Majestic 12's
    modus operandi to control, quote,
    UFO surveillance and interdictions, retrievals,
    and analysis of records of extraterrestrial
    spacecraft and occupants, and public access
    to any information about these matters, end quote.
    As part of his duties, Wilson would be assigned
    to the First Special Forces Air Command,
    and would undergrow special training with Delta Force
    and the then Black Berets.
    For nine years, Colonel Wilson claimed to visit
    nearly every Air Force Base in the world
    and make contact with key people for the Majestic 12 unit.
    Wilson states, whilst a Lieutenant Colonel in 1972,
    he was reassigned from First Special Forces Air Command
    at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California
    to Area S-4, near Papouse Lake, south of Area 51,
    by men with CIA credentials.
    I am skipping a tremendous amount of detail here,
    as this is not our subject for today,
    but Wilson would travel 30 stories underground
    in the facility where he witnessed eight different
    kinds of non-human craft, as well as an extremely
    tall woman that appeared to be extraterrestrial.
    According to Wilson, S-4 operated to test
    anti-gravity reverse engineered vehicles.
    The first successful flight had allegedly occurred
    on July 18, 1971, a year before his station,
    which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test.
    Interesting connection to Echler, Inman, and Shapiro,
    as we stated above.
    After some time at S-4, Wilson would claim to head
    Project Pounce, an elite Air Force NRO Special Forces unit
    which retrieved downed UFOs.
    Oddly enough, Project Pounce can be observed
    in the disputed Majestic 12 Project Aquarius document
    and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report.
    Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel
    to reduce public concern regarding UFOs.
    So, Wilson has a big, unprovable testimony.
    What does any of this have to do with Northrop Grumman?
    In his disclosures to Dr. Boylan, Wilson additionally named
    US Aerospace Vehicles that had been created
    utilizing reverse engineered non-human technology.
    Many of these vehicles would feature anti-gravity systems,
    and after all of the research we've done on this channel
    and the words of Jake Barber, maybe this isn't so far-fetched.
    The implications of what you're saying also are that potentially
    there is some kind of capacity to draw incredible amounts of energy
    from the quantum vacuum.
    I've seen it.
    You've seen it.
    I've seen it.
    There's also, obviously, the capacity to use propulsion systems
    that are far beyond what we're describing.
    Yeah, that seems to be the case as well.
    Anti-gravity.
    Anti-gravity.
    They know about it.
    Anti-gravity, zero point energy.
    Those secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge.
    Wilson would state US clandestine military operations
    began flying the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle,
    but also discussed an anti-gravity disc
    that glowed intense orange-golden during flight.
    Wilson claimed this craft was made by Northrop Aerospace
    at their secret facility northeast of Lancaster, California.
    This location is quite interesting,
    as it matches the underground Northrop range
    we discussed earlier in this investigation.
    Wilson would even state the Northrop, Lockheed,
    and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities were connected alongside
    Area 51 and other sensitive locations via underground train systems.
    Wilson claimed these tunnels were excavated by nuclear subterranes,
    which is actually very interesting.
    Nuclear subterranes are massive tunneling machines
    that work by melting rock with heat supplied
    via a compact nuclear reactor.
    Numerous patents for such machines were designed
    by Los Alamos National Laboratories in the 1970s,
    and don't worry, we will fully dive into this in the dumb video.
    Boylan had reportedly witnessed this craft in test flight
    over Area 51 in the Northrop complex near Edwards,
    dubbing it Northrop's Great Pumpkin Disk.
    These two siding locations are another fascinating connection to EDD,
    and the joint reverse engineering effort between Edwards,
    contractors, and Area 51.
    Wilson made additional mentions to a reverse engineered craft
    designated the XH-75D, or the XH Shark.
    This craft is allegedly an anti-gravity helicopter
    designed by Teledyne Ryan San Diego Division.
    Wilson claimed these craft were assigned to Delta IV
    slash the NRO for UFO crash retrievals.
    This mention of NRO and Delta is indeed intriguing.
    Delta Force, part of the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC,
    has been accused of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals
    under the CIA Office of Global Access, as has indeed the NRO.
    In fact, the NRO was one of two intelligence agencies,
    the other being the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
    we discussed above with C4ISR.
    David Grush worked on as liaison to the UAP Task Force,
    where he discovered the existence of UAP legacy programs.
    The NRO was also one of three intelligence agencies
    alongside the CIA and NSA mentioned by Edgar Fuchet
    as managing the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle.
    Very little has been discussed on this craft,
    the XH-75D, original drawing by Wilson on screen now.
    And almost no actionable investigation can arise
    from Wilson's incredibly brief testimony on this craft.
    The Colonel never discussed the intended application
    or function of the onboard anti-gravity system.
    What I do find interesting is a 2019 design concept
    created by one of Lockheed Martin's subsidiaries,
    the Sikorsky Raider X.
    Dual rotor helicopters are not rare.
    They are often implemented on helicopters designed for heavy lift.
    One would have to ask why the XH-75D would need dual rotors
    with an anti-gravity system.
    But the Raider X, canceled in 24,
    sought to create a quote,
    agile, survivable compound coaxial helicopter
    that will equip future aviators to address
    evolving peer and near-peer threats
    in the most difficult environments, end quote.
    No further linkages beyond design exist between these platforms.
    However, I do find it interesting the XH-75D,
    drawn by Wilson in 97,
    looks almost identical to the concept craft
    proposed by Lockheed in 2019.
    So is the anti-gravity disk in helicopter
    proposed by Wilson real?
    Well, this is unfortunately a dead end of investigation.
    As I said, Wilson's testimony must be considered
    little more than third-party research.
    Because while it is fascinating
    and ties intimately to some claims made regarding
    UAP Legacy Recovery programs throughout history,
    there is little evidence or actionable data to pursue.
    I would, however, like to leave discussion of Wilson
    with a chart he made regarding the structure
    of UAP Legacy programs.
    Please note, the rendition I am showing now
    is a recreation of Wilson's 97 chart published in 2001.
    Numerous spelling errors can be observed here,
    such as in Lockheed.
    This chart is titled Star Wars City
    in reference to the Strategic Defense Initiative,
    the program we mentioned above,
    and a program I have discussed many times,
    instituted by Reagan in the 1980s
    with possible ties to Eisenhower.
    To state again, the SDI program instituted to protect
    the United States from ballistic nuclear attacks
    has been referenced by numerous witnesses
    who have stated the program had a backdoor functionality
    to act offensively against UAP
    and back-channeled funds to fund UFO Legacy programs.
    From the chart, Star Wars City
    located under the Cheyenne Mountain Complex
    in Colorado Springs, Colorado,
    oversees the U.S. Space Counterintelligence Headquarters
    within the SDI as the nexus of UAP Legacy programs.
    Within this chart, there are numerous institutions
    one might expect to be associated with UAP retrieval
    and exploitation programs, the NRO,
    National Security Council, National Security Agency,
    CIA, NORAD, and Majestic 12.
    Adhering to the SDI, Colorado HQ, and Magi,
    there exists a list of contractors
    alleged to engage with the UAP portfolio.
    Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed,
    Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and IBM are mentioned.
    We also find Decision Science Applications Inc.
    DSAI was led by former Admiral
    and recurring character of this project, Bobby Ray Inman,
    and most likely had its assets handed over to SAIC.
    A contractor I believe is as involved in legacy operations
    as Northrop or Lockheed.
    Another project for another day,
    as DSAI is quite a worthy investigation.
    DSI, according to the chart and Wilson's testimony,
    consists of directors of relevant UAP black budget divisions
    from the aforementioned contractors,
    as well as Ford Aerospace, which is now part of Northrop Grumman,
    and Teledyne Ryan,
    which was one of Northrop's premium purchases.
    When Teledyne Ryan did indeed play a vital role
    in the Strategic Defense Initiative,
    the contractor was well regarded for designing
    and producing high-performance aerial targets,
    which were crucial for testing and evaluation potential
    for missile defense systems,
    as well as developing advanced sensors
    that could be used for detecting and tracking
    incoming ballistic missiles.
    TRW, Northrop's crown jewel,
    additionally aided in the SDI program,
    such as using its locations
    for high-powered chemical laser testing.
    And as we mentioned above,
    Northrop itself takes great pride in aiding in the SDI program
    in 1983, creating the first laser radar used in space.
    It is fascinating, even in a testimony like Wilson's,
    we can still find links to Northrop's many acquisitions
    and UAP legacy programs.
    And now onto a whistleblower by the acronym of A-H
    that appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.
    And I must state again, regarding Greer's witnesses,
    let us analyze the quality and claims of the whistleblower
    instead of the platform.
    Unfortunately, Greer's poor operational security
    is ever-present, as clips of A-H are listed
    in the DPI archive as Arnold House.
    I believe I have located this individual
    and have reached out to talk to him.
    I have heard nothing.
    Arnold's testimony revolves around the significant information
    he gained regarding UAP programs
    while a surface technician at the Boeing Aerospace Company,
    as well as insights gained from friend and four-star general,
    Curtis LeMay.
    As we dive in, it is crucial to maintain awareness
    how his disclosures are indeed secondhand.
    As far as his testimony,
    House never participated directly in program operations.
    His information was handed to him from friends at NSA,
    CIA, NASA, JPL,
    Office of Naval Intelligence Area 51,
    USAF, Northrop, Boeing, and various generals.
    This information was so complete, according to Greer,
    House briefed Bill Clinton in 1990.
    I have no evidence to confirm this briefing.
    The only possible link I can find is a letter to Clinton from Greer
    marked 9 July 2000,
    where Greer requested the city president to disclose
    UFO-related USAPs at the suggestion of their mutual friend.
    I do find House very worthy of discussion
    as we can find correspondences with him and Greer
    as recently as 2018 and as old as December 2000.
    Perhaps House, like William Hamilton,
    has served as one of Greer's primary sources of information
    over the decades.
    In his taped testimony linked in description,
    House stated one day around 1987
    at the home of General Curtis LeMay,
    the infamous general confirmed the Roswell, New Mexico crash.
    House also learned from his NSA friend that Henry Kissinger,
    George Bush, as well as Ronald Reagan
    and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the UAP subject.
    His friends in CIA relayed to House
    that they, along with USAF, had downed NHI craft.
    Arnold even claimed he learned from a friend in the FBI
    that the Bureau had radar testing that was causing interference
    with some of the craft resulting in crashes.
    This echoes Lieutenant Colonel Corso's sentiments
    regarding the crash of the Roswell, New Mexico craft.
    House also learned and relayed there are underground bases
    testing and maintaining TUOs,
    likely Dugway, Palmdale, California,
    Edwards Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and others.
    Interesting we see Palmdale and Edwards pop up once again.
    But now let's focus directly on Arnold's information
    regarding Northrop.
    House's entire testimony could lead to an entire video
    so maybe we will save that for whistleblowers volume 3.
    A.H. stated while at Boeing he met a man
    in the Army Criminal Investigation Division, CID,
    who was involved in several crash recovery since 1947
    and had served in Army CIC, Counter Intelligence Corps, Capacity.
    The gentleman handpicked one of House's friends
    at the Boeing aircraft company to become part of a UFO
    crash recovery team in northern New Mexico starting in 1980.
    This friend of A.H. would somehow relay information
    regarding his time in legacy program operations
    from 1980 to 1997, 17 years.
    The time of these disclosures is not given, however,
    as investigators we must assume that his friend
    informed Arnold after leaving program operations in 1997.
    House's friend was ultimately stationed and helped
    with reverse engineering efforts and testing
    of non-human craft at Area 51.
    He was not working for the U.S. government or military, however.
    His paychecks during these years in legacy programs
    came directly from Northrop.
    The source would illustrate Northrop, Lockheed Martin,
    and Boeing all engaged in UFO reverse engineering efforts
    at Area 51.
    The facility itself from 1980 to 1997
    held a tremendous amount of extraterrestrial debris
    in a containment area.
    This source would also tell House some of the program
    was shifted to a location in Utah,
    likely dugway-proving grounds.
    They moved most of the stuff from Area 51,
    at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah.
    Just basically those companies and of course,
    Lockheed and Northrop.
    This is very interesting as USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
    said the exact same thing.
    Some Area 51 legacy programs were relocated to dugway
    in the early 1990s.
    I myself have talked about dugway previously
    and plan to revisit with a contractor witness
    who claimed to stumble upon a floating saucer craft
    within a classified testing area on base.
    Here is where House's testimony regarding Area 51
    and Northrop gets really interesting.
    This same friend told Arnold the A51 program
    to test NHI vehicles and exploit technological materials
    was called Project Red Light.
    There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area
    and near, this is very funny, it's near Northrop.
    There's an underground area out there too
    that he was aware of, but he particularly mentioned
    and stayed focused on ANZA, California.
    There's some underground areas up there too
    that they're researching some of this technology
    and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.
    This should immediately become familiar to many of my viewers
    as I have referenced this Project Red Light
    on numerous occasions.
    I have traced first mention of this project
    to the files of the late legendary researcher
    Leonard Stringfield, author of Crash Retrieval Status Reports
    1-7 and relayed by excellent researcher Michael Schrat.
    In a letter dated April 5th, 1980,
    one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one MH,
    a witness identity Schrat chose not to disclose.
    MH allegedly performed radio maintenance
    at the atomic proving grounds in Nevada during 1961 to 1963,
    along with top secret radio work for USAF.
    According to MH, he participated in a top secret operation
    at Area 51 titled Project Red Light.
    Test flights were conducted under this project
    on a recovered UFO shipped from none other than Edwards Air Force Base.
    The craft was not conventionally powered
    and stayed silent during operation.
    Security was so tight on the project,
    program personnel were rotated every six months.
    MH claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast
    American defense contractor encountering difficulties
    in reverse engineering many of the components comprising the craft.
    I have drawn a parallel between Red Light and the testimony of Ed.
    We have referenced numerous times throughout this project,
    a joint Edwards Area 51 reverse engineering program
    out of the Edwards 412th Test Group.
    Well, Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
    additionally mentioned Project Red Light.
    Fouchet claimed he gathered knowledge
    defense contractor EGNG was awarded an indefinite contract
    for Project Red Light to support the DOE and military.
    If you have not heard of EGNG,
    this is the contractor historically implicated with UAP programs
    made infamous in the story of Bob Lazar
    as the contractor that hired him to work out of Site 4.
    This contract gave EGNG responsibility
    to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps
    and to provide aerial and ground security
    for highly classified government and military sites.
    If the testimony of Arnold House
    and his legacy program connections are indeed true,
    Northrop Grumman could have indeed served
    as a project manager for Project Red Light,
    testing non-human intelligence and alien reproduction vehicles
    in a joint contractor Edwards 412th Test Group operation.
    Absolutely incredible links to ponder.
    We have no project stork,
    we have no direct mention of Lockheed and so forth
    but almost in a way I find that a little more intriguing
    for my research.
    With Northrop we devoted so much time
    to look specifically at Northrop Grumman's acquisitions
    TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM,
    connections to Aerospace Corporation and FFRDCs
    and I find this so fascinating how
    Northrop's involvement outside of mentions of Fuchshe
    and a couple other mentions here and there
    and comments from Jack Northrop at the beginning of the video
    they seem to purchase up buy-up companies
    that had legacy operations.
    TRW and its implication in the Wilson Davis Memo
    and the Phil Pentagon audit that almost outed the senior review group.
    $200 million today Northrop paid
    to settle that lawsuit for TRW.
    Now they acquired them I believe for $6 or $7 billion
    that's a drop in the bucket
    but it's interesting that a year after the acquisition
    Northrop's still okay with you know what TRW
    you're implicated in this massive lawsuit
    but don't worry we'll pay for it.
    So I find that sort of research absolutely
    scintillating instead of just direct confirmations
    and direct ties like we had with Lockheed and Battelle.
    I also find all of the whistleblower testimony
    of Northrop to be incredibly fast
    and you know I wouldn't be
    surprised to see full projects on Steve Wilson
    and Arnold Howe soon.
    Like I mentioned I've tried to connect with House
    because I do believe with a high degree of certainty
    I have found that individual
    and Colonel or yeah,
    Colonel Steve Wilson is no longer with us
    he passed in 1997
    but his testimony is still shrouded in mystery
    and his legitimacy in USAF
    is still surrounded in mystery
    so a lot more to explore there
    but I find it really interesting
    from the work of William Hamilton
    the testimony of AH
    that there's still these little comments
    that are ubiquitous around testimony
    that I still find to be quite accurate
    mentions of the SDI
    and UAP Legacy programs mentioned
    Northrop's involvement in underground facilities
    mention of underground facilities
    mentioning you know dating to Fouché as well
    projects being moved from Area 51
    to Dugway Proving Grounds
    even mentions of Area 51 in Edwards
    as we see in Arnold Howe's
    Red Light, Fouché, etc.
    So the question must be asked
    why is Northrop's involvement
    in Legacy programs operations
    so shrouded
    why do they pass under the radar
    alongside companies like Boeing and Raytheon
    while Lockheed Martin, while Battelle
    these guys, I mean even General Electric
    to a certain degree are always labeled
    as the prime contractors
    well I do have someone of a thesis there
    I think Battelle
    bar biological storage
    at probably Fort Detrick or Fort Belbois
    is a little bit out of the game
    they're a little bit said and done
    I think the three, four primary players
    if we want to say
    are Lockheed Boeing
    who is likely a project manager
    for operations
    Northrop and Raytheon
    I think these are the big guys
    I think that
    Lockheed is sort of like
    a hound dog
    Lockheed will respond to a beck and call
    they will do what is required of them
    they are the loudest in the room
    etc. I think Lockheed
    is
    they will take advantage of a situation
    and they are opportunists
    the reason I say this is the
    2008 material transfer to OSAP
    that was blocked by Glenn Gaffney
    in the CIA
    directorate of science and technology
    Lockheed itself
    offered to divest itself of materials
    now was this
    to get in the good graces
    of the CIA
    the OGA, the DS&T
    the NRO probably
    did Lockheed give up
    materials they could reverse engineer
    Lockheed give away materials they think
    that any other
    corporation or agency
    could reverse engineer
    and garner insights from probably not
    this was probably materials they thought
    well if we can't figure it out no one else can
    so we might as well
    get in good favor with some people
    and get rid of these materials
    which is likely from the 1953 Kigman, Arizona crash
    but that's a whole other conversation
    Northrop
    their work seems to be shrouded
    in much more secrecy
    they are not offering to divest themselves
    of material they are often seen in the shadows
    they are often tag-lined
    in testimonies like Fouche's
    as the
    person in the shadows
    so that makes the question
    what work are they doing
    well I believe it's material exploitation
    reverse engineering and testing of ARV
    and likely project
    managerial responsibilities
    for the red light project if that is still ongoing
    or if that has shifted since Ed's time
    around
    Nellis and Edwards
    ending in about 2006 to 2008
    so if that project is still ongoing
    I think that Lockheed operates
    similar to
    and I forgot one on the Mount Rushmore of Legacy
    operations SAIC
    I think Northrop
    alongside Lockheed alongside SAIC
    Boeing and perhaps Raytheon
    they operate across all segments
    of US military have commented numerous times
    that
    the Army, the Air Force
    and the Navy
    their programs are extremely compartmentalized
    stove piped as Eric Davis said
    and don't really have much interaction with each other
    the common threads here are the contractors
    that interact
    in programs across compartments
    and possibly the UARCs
    and FFRDCs that do as well
    there might be some
    small contractors that help out
    with Air Force responsibilities
    and one such company might be
    Alien Science and Technologies
    helping Ed
    and the project red light
    if you want to call it that out at Edwards
    but the project managers
    the companies that seem to do quite a bit
    then engage in all facets
    of legacy program operations
    operate across all of these boards
    so is Northrop still
    ongoing in research I would probably say
    yes and Northrop has
    is up to their eyeballs just like SAIC
    like Lockheed and just like Boeing
    but these are my personal opinions
    I think that even though much of the research
    we have studied today is still
    whistleblower testimony and
    a bit nebulous at some points
    like Steve Wilson
    I still think there are numerous fascinating ties
    I mean
    again I want to harken back
    to Northrop's many acquisitions
    and even date that back to Sparey Rand
    when it went defunct
    its departments going to Northrop Grumman
    and Lockheed and others
    and connections to the Corso testimony
    all of these neat little threads
    that kind of tie Northrop
    and its purchasing streak interwoven
    into stories of legacy
    program operations it's very fascinating
    in a sense this project was
    almost a little bit more conclusive to me
    than even Lockheed or Battelle
    I would like to know what everybody else here thinks
    you know perhaps Northrop silence
    is a sign of danger
    we don't know all we can do is continue
    to investigate and if you have any other
    insights into Northrop
    or testimony I would love to hear from
    you and to tell me what you think in the comments
    with that guys we will move on
    because I think I've been ranting out for about
    8 minutes please remember
    to like and subscribe
    always look forward to the next project
    we'll get back in live
    soon because I would like to talk
    a little bit about concurring
    events you know with the whistleblower
    testimony of Jake Barber
    Dr. John Blitch
    Don Paul Bales
    and so forth and Fred Baker
    but I don't want to make that my channel
    I'm not a news of the day type of guy
    as you all know you know there's a lot
    of space between the videos so we'll figure
    out something there so please remember to like
    and subscribe guys I do have a patreon
    you can find that on the channel page
    I don't gate keep content all of my
    research as everybody knows is open source
    so only support what
    you think the channel is worth
    you're not getting much extra there it's just
    go help me out make these investigations
    purchasing better camera equipment because
    as everybody can see this camera isn't great
    and you know maybe funding
    my trips to go speak to witnesses
    which I do plan to do quite soon so
    thank you so much again for joining me and
    I will catch everybody on the next show
    later everybody thanks
