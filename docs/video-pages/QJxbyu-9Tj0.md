??? note "Description"
    A deep dive into one of the most infamous, controversial, and fascinating UFO crash retrievals in US history - the 25 March 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO Crash Retrieval, where a 99.9 foot diameter saucer allegedly landed with deceased non-human biologics in northern New Mexico.
    
    Aztec made its way into the public zietgesit via Frank Scully's 1950 best seller "Behind the Flying Saucers". The Aztec story was quickly destroyed by the 1952 reporting of J.P. Cahn when Scully's sources - Silas Newton and a group of scientists known as Dr. Gee (whom Cahn labeled and targeted as one Mr. Leo Gebauer), were convicted of oil fraud.
    
    The case largely remained dormant until 1986 when UFO researcher William Steinman reinvigorated the case by introducing myriad new details - involvement of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, an on-site scientific team spearheaded by Dr. Vannevar Bush featuring Von Nueman, Oppenheimer, and others, and revisiting the 1950s court case of Silas Newton and Leo Gebauer to assess just how guilty, or innocent, these convicted con men were...... 
    
    Aztec was again bolstered in 2011 by Scott and Suzanne Ramsay, who performed extensive analysis on Aztec retrieval logistics, the trustworthiness of Newton and Gebauer, and interviewed several eyewitnesses to the Aztec Sacuer, some of whom claimed to serve in the Air Force on the side of the retrieval team....
    
    In this project, we investigate the story of Aztec through the reporting of Scully, Steinman, and the 2011 Book on Aztec by Scott Ramsay, address the controversy around Newton, Gebauer, and Cahn, study the players and IPU alleged to be involved in the recovery, connect the unique craft recovery to DNI Sumner Shapiro and NASA mission specialist Bob Oechsler, assess the real identities of "dr. Gee",  explore if a 99.9 foot diameter saucer really did crash land and much more......
