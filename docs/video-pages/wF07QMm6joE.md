??? note "Description"
    In late 1988, accomplished aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish came into information that indicated the United States Government had antigravity craft reverse-engineered from non-human technology.
    
    This information was relayed to mark from his good friend Brad Sorensen. Sorensen was wrongfully permitted access to a "special exhibit" at the November 12th, 1988 Norton Air Force Base air show.  Brad had witnessed strange craft - the losing competitor to the B2 Bomber, small hovercraft technology, and a flattened-out football known as the Lockheed Aurora.
    
    A secondary display showed three flying saucers known as Alien Reproduction Vehicles nicknamed "Flux Liners". The craft was capable of beyond-light speeds and had been reverse-engineered from off-shelf components from technology recovered from nonhuman intelligence.  
    
    Let's dive into the story of the flux liner, the physics behind the craft, other sightings of the craft, and most importantly, a long-forgotten 1990 interview with primary witness Brad Sorensen who not only confirms the ARVs, but adds even more astounding details.
