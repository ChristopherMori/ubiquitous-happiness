??? note "Description"
    A deep dive into the testimony of UFO Whistleblower USMC LCpl Jonathan Weygandt featuring BRAND NEW 2025 in-person footage with Weygandt.
    
    In March-April of 1997, while deployed in Peru for USSOUTHCOM Operation Laser Strike, LCpl Weygandt was tasked with fellow marines to investigate a downed aircraft in the area. Upon reaching the crash site, Weygandt and the other marines discovered an enormous, egg-shaped UFO crashed into a rocky cliff face.
    
    While investigating the crash site, the marines were intercepted by unmarked operators wearing black fatigues and a subsequent Department of Energy team outfitted in MOPP (Mission Oriented Protective Posture) gear.
    
    Wegyadnt was isolated from his fellow marines and forcefully taken to an unknown location and interrogated.
    
    The Lance Corporal famously disclosed this experience in 2000, but only spoke publicly about the encounter once more in 2023. Today, I am proud to announce TWO pieces with Jonathan Weygandt - an in-person interview coming soon, and this in-depth investigation with Weygandt to investigate this harrowing testimony.
    
    With the help of Weygandt, this investigation seeks to:
    - Recap his experience
    - Determine plausible locations for the UFO crash site
    - Identify the DOE team and point of origin
    - Uncover the station of the "black ops" in black fatigues with no insignia
    - Contact the other marines with Jonathan on this encounter
    - Determine if Defense Support Program Satellites monitored this nonhuman craft
