??? note "Description"
    An exploration into fascinating and perplexing sightings of USO throughout the 18th-20th century. USO or unidentified submerged objects are the opposite sides of the same coin to their cousins UFO. Often considered one phenomenon, trans medium UAP these objects perform anomalous feats in fluid mediums and retain shapes associated with craft. 
    
    In USO sightings, common themes have appeared worldwide over the years. Tic Tac or cigar-shaped objects are often seen hovering just above the water's surface, often gyrating or quivering. Luminous balls of light are seen rising from the depths to perform what seem like curious maneuvers, hovering by a vessel before returning to sea or shooting off into the distance. Egg-shaped or elliptical craft are often seen entering or leaving the oceans. Anomalous wheels of light are seen varying in size and rotation, often time spiraling rapidly and appearing above and below waters.
    
    This video explores a body of sightings from US project Blue Book, the USSR, Australia, 20th-century cases, and the anomaly of repeated maritime light wheel sightings.
