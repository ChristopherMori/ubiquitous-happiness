??? note "Description"
    A detailed investigation into the claims of US Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso's claims of US Army Office of Chief of Army R&D (OCRD)'s creation of a Foreign Technology Division tasked with handling technologies of unknown origin. According to Corso, the FTD sought to seed technologies found inside UFO crashes such as 1947 Roswell New Mexico into US industry for the expressed purpose of Bolstering the United States Armed Forces.
    
    For this investigation, we will conduct a full analysis of Corso's myriad claims and military history. This project seeks to leave his 1997 book "Day After Roswell" behind and study solely Corso's manuscript "Dawn of a New Age" as the best-selling book has numerous details and fluff added, likely by the book's co-writer, missing in the manuscript.
    
    Are Corso's claims of a US Army UFO legacy program seeding non-human technologies into US industry and armed forces indeed true? And what can we learn from this testimony, especially regarding the structure of US legacy UFO programs?
