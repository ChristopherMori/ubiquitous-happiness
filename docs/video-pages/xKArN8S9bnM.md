    Even in 2024, when someone mentions UFOs in private or professional circles, they are often scoffed at and met with ridicule. Historically, mentioning a UAP sighting by a commercial or military pilot has been a death sentence, and politicians/military personnel avoid any mention of unidentified craft to maintain "sound mind".
    
    But where and why did this stigma begin? Was it conducted purposefully to alter public perception of the phenomena? In today's video, we will walk through the carefully conducted disinformation campaign orchestrated by the USG, CIA, and USG Military throughout the 1950s and 1960s to lump the study of UFO and "flying saucer" with the likes of paranormal topics such as ghosts, bigfoot, Illuminati conspiracy, etc. 
    
    By leveraging the USG and USAF official UFO investigation studies - Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book, as well as orchestrating the famous Robertson Panel and Condon Committee, all scientific investigation ability was stripped of UFOs and the subject became pseudoscience. 
    
    Of course, we know even with the termination of Project Blue Book in 1969, the USG maintained rigid study into UFO until the present day....
