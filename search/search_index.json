But on this planet, and throughout the Cold War, UAP has had an interest in humanity's harnessing of the atom, and in some direct cases, actually tampered with or disabled Nuclear Warheads. </p> <p>In this video, we will cover the fascinating cases of Lt. Robert Jacob's Vandenberg AFB UFO footage and the Malmstrom Minuteman Missile shutdown case, two of the most perplexing and well-documented UFO nuclear encounters.</p> <p>The credibility of these cases cannot be understated - Jacob's case was reported to Dr. Kirkpatrick of AARO in 2023 and the Malmstrom case was directly confirmed by David Grusch in his 2023 News Week article. BOTH cases feature sworn affidavits by multiple witnesses.</p> <p>Why are UFOs so interested in nuclear weapons? Is it because whatever non-human intelligence piloting these craft is frightened of human weaponry being used against them or something a little more scientific, like an observation of a civilization encountering the great filter? We can only guess until we have more data, but cases like these help us begin to hypothesize. </p> <p>Thank you for watching UAP Gerb Gang and please remember to like and subscribe!</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:38 Jacobs UFO Tape 8:15 Malmstrom AFB Incident 11:13 1977 FOIA Reports 11:42 Indian Point Nuclear Station UFO 13:22 Conclusion</p> <p>Lt.

This alleged crash retrieval first surfaced in 1973, years before the resurfacing of the Roswell incident in which Jesse Marcel revealed his participation in the cover-up in 1978.</p> <p>The first revelations of this retrieval occurred with UFO researcher Raymond Fowler's interview of an engineer on project Upshot-Knothole who was sent to analyze craft ballistics of the wreckage operating under the pseudonym Fitz Warner. It would later come to light that Fitz was indeed respected engineer Arthur Stansel who had an accomplished career in the US armed forces, civilian engineering at Wright Patterson, and the Atomic Energy Commission. </p> <p>Besides Stansel's shocking testimony, his work under Dr. Ed Doll and Dr. Eric Wang alongside add interest to the alleged crash. Events around this time such as USAF regulation 200-2, the Robertson Panel, and the testimonies of Robert Jacobs &amp; Robert Salas on UFOs and nukes add key context to the event.</p> <p>Also testifying to the Kingman Crash is retired USMC vet and engineer Bill Uhouse who claimed to work on a flying saucer simulator based on the craft retrieved from the 53 Kingman Crash.</p> <p>Strap in and don't crash as we analyze the Kingman UAP Crash!</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:08 Fitz Werner AKA Arthur Stansel Jr. 8:41 Stansel's Claims 11:14 Kingman Crash Context 13:16 Bill Uhouse 17:12 Additional Witnesses &amp; Disinformation 18:44 Conclusion</p> <p>Kingman Overview: https://www.ufoinsight.com/ufos/cover-ups/kingman-ufo-crash</p> <p>Fitz Werner Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffONAXpPJH8&amp;t=301s</p> <p>Arthur Stansel Junior Backgroud: https://medium.com/@richgel99/1953-kingman-az-crash-retrieval-6eac40d724c7</p> <p>Ray Fowler &amp; Stansel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4CvjWEB6C8&amp;t=212s</p> <p>Operation Upshot-Knothole Docs: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA121624.pdf</p> <p>https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA073476.pdf</p> <p>Dr. Ed Droll: https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/edward-b-doll/</p> <p>Dr. Wang: https://www.ufocasebook.com/Arizona.html</p> <p>USAF Regulation 200-2: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81R00560R000100040072-9.pdf</p> <p>UAP Gerb Stigma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKArN8S9bnM&amp;t=4s</p> <p>UAP Gerb Nukes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DK2u8HlhDE&amp;t=14s</p> <p>Bill Uhouse Testimony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxA-Y4enohQ</p> <p>Uhouse Background: https://medium.com/@richgel99/william-bill-g-uhouses-marine-corps-service-verified-53890a291fac</p> <p>How and Why On Simulator: https://web.archive.org/web/20220718203329/https:/www.howandwhys.com/former-area-51-engineer-claimed-testing-re-engineered-ufo-that-crashed-in-arizona-in-1953-with-four-aliens/</p> <p>Leanord Stringfield On Crash (Part 1 and 2): https://github.com/richgel999/uap_resources/blob/main/1978_Mufon_Symposium_Stringfield.pdf</p> <p>http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/FSR%201979%20V%2025%20N%205.pdf</p> <p>Music by the Always Talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg</p> <p>Nick Redfern on Kingman: (Pg 37): https://archive.org/details/crash-retrieval-conference-proceedings-3rd-annual-2005/page/37/mode/1up</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/41V4Pf_8oo4/#ufo-uap-uapnukes-uapdisclosure-ufology-ufonews-ufosightings-uapsightings-ufofootage-uapfootage-hynek-condoncomittee-jallenhynek-projectsign-projectgrudge-projectbluebook-bluebook-ufocongress-sol-solfoundation-karlnell-battelle-uforeverseengineering-lockheed-skunkworks-lockheedmartin-rosscoulthart-fastwalker-blackvault-slowwalker-kingman-ufocrash-nickredfern","title":"ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker #kingman #ufocrash #nickredfern","text":""},{"location":"video-pages/41V4Pf_8oo4/#transcript","title":"Transcript","text":"<p>Transcript coming soon (pending local Whisper run).</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/4EMO38JUfVE/","title":"Michael Herrera - Insights into UAP Encounter and Black Program Insiders","text":"<p>Published: 2024-06-30  \u00b7  Duration: 2:05:20  \u00b7  Channel: UAP Gerb</p> Description <p>Interview with Michael Herrera, USMC veteran and AARO whistleblower. Michael claims to have observed a large, octagonal-shaped UAP operated by a human black ops team while on a human relief mission in Indonesia in 2009.

Since investigating Michael's claims, Joey has formed a relationship with Michael and has gained access to many details of Michael's encounter and following experiences never before discussed. Today Joey and I will be breaking down the entirety of Michael's allegations as well as Joey's insights and experiences both investigating and speaking to Michael. </p> <p>Follow Joey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JoeyIsntMyName Follow Joey on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/joeyisnotmyname/</p> <p>So who is Michael Herrera and what does he claim? First appearing publically in the summer of 2023 and then being confirmed as a first-hand whistleblower in the AARO Historical Report Volume 1, Michael Herrera claims to have experienced a massive, 300-foot-long, octagonal UFO in the jungles of Indonesia while serving in the USMC. This operation was not NHI, but run by a rogue military force who seemingly operated a revere-engineered craft and performed human transportation in the earthquake-ravaged environment. </p> <p>Following his 2023 public appearance on Steven Greer's Press Club panel, Michael claims to be approached by an \"insider\" who works in reverse engineering on NHI tech. This insider is allegedly pro-disclosure and wishes to trust Michael to leak small pieces of the USG black program's operations.</p> <p>Both the claims of witnessing the craft and meeting the insider seem wild and fantastical at first glance, but is there any truth or threads to pull on to validate the story of Michael Herrera and the underground UAP black group?

The Gorman Dogfight, the Finnish UAP Air Force Sighting of 1969, the Arequipa Encounter, and the 2004 Mexican Air Force Incident are extremely underrepresented cases when compared to the incredibly famous Gimbal, Go Fast, and UFO tapes released by the NYT in 2017.  </p> <p>UFO cases by military air forces, navy, or ground personnel are often extremely credible sightings due to multi-sensor detection and the keen, trained eye of fighter pilots. Oftentimes, global sightings are drowned out by the ever-popular US cases; so for that reason, let's cover not just the US but Global UFO encounters with military jets.</p> <p>Some cases pictured are legendary in their respective countries and some have been discovered through official USG Project Sign or Moon Dust Documents.

These whistleblowers can be of ironclad reputation like David Grusch, bound by legal testimony like Robert Salas, or have interesting stories with no real evidence like Bob Lazar.</p> <p>Today's video focuses on 3 sets of claims - Harland Bentley who claimed to have observed a UFO crash in Maryland, Senator Barry Goldwater who was denied access to the \"Blue Room\" of Wright Patterson AFB, and the enigmatic Marine RB who claimed to have guarded a nonhuman vehicle in 1963.</p> <p>Bentley's background, at least in public realms, is nonverifiable but his claims of a UAP crash near a Nike Ajax Missile in Maryland as well as the crew of Apollo 8 encountering a craft on their way to Apollo 8 carry some astounding parallel research. </p> <p>Goldwater famously was denied access to the \"blue room\" of WPAFB where UAP material was stored by General Curtis Lemay. This statement is powerful, especially with the intrigue of non-human technology surrounding WPAFB at this time, the connections of Lemay to UFO, as well as FOIA requests on destroyed Blue Room documentation.</p> <p>RB's story has no verifiable elements as of this video but it is compelling and fantastic. The marine who claimed to guard a UAP for 2 weeks offers astonishing detail into the craft's makeup as well as scientific and military practices around the craft.</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:38 Harland Bentley  15:49 Senator Barry Goldwater  21:34 RB 26:49 Conclusion</p> <p>UAP Gerb Whistleblower Vol1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKEZ2BClIb0</p> <p>UAP Gerb Kingman Crash: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41V4Pf_8oo4&amp;t=980s</p> <p>Harland Bentley Disclosure Project Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqsU76GRq4</p> <p>Harland Bentley NPC Appearance (start 57 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DrcG7VGgQU&amp;t=2879s</p> <p>W-93 Ajax Nike Site: https://clui.org/ludb/site/olney-federal-support-center</p> <p>W-92 Ajax Nike Site: https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nike-missile-site-w92</p> <p>1958 USAF in Possession of Disc: https://www.newspapers.com/image/370534744/?match=1&amp;terms=%20saucer</p> <p>Lock Raven Reservoir Case: https://archive.org/details/1958-10-6975164-LockRavenDam-Maryland-6148-/page/n5/mode/2up https://www.nicap.org/581026lochravendam_dir.htm https://www.newspapers.com/image/370498159/?match=1&amp;terms=saucer https://archive.org/details/ufoexperience00jall/mode/2up</p> <p>1958 W-93 Case (pg 79): https://sohp.us/collections/ufos-a-history/pdf/GROSS-1958-Aug-Sept.pdf</p> <p>Frank Borman Transcript: https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/1555931059480510464  https://armaghplanet.com/astronauts-aeroplanes-and-ufos.html </p> <p>Alain Boudier: http://scienceetovnis.eklablog.com/alain-boudier-p61417 </p> <p>Barry Goldwater WPAFB Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtJo6vKnY54 https://files.afu.se//Downloads/Magazines/United%20States/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service%20-%201974%2001%20-%20no%2057.pdf#page=4 </p> <p>Gen.

Similar to colossal US defense contractors like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, SAIC has historically been named as a premier US defense contractor engaging in Technologies of Unknown Origin (TUO) retrieval and exploitation programs.</p> <p>SAIC is infamously known as the \u201cNSA West\u201d, historically encouraging senior USG Department of Defense and Intelligence Community officials such as Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, DIA DS&amp;T Deputy Director Donald Kerr, and DEPSECDEF John Deutch to join its board.</p> <p>SAIC has an extremely checkered history, often facing high-profile legal action for fraud and waste of US Federal and Intelligence Community projects such as NSA Trailblazer, and FBI V.C.F., while also engaging in bizarre psychic programs under Project Stargate focused on Remote Viewing and \u201cAnomalous Perturbation\u201d. </p> <p>Unlike some of the recognizable contractors such as Northrop and Lockheed, SAIC has largely managed to keep it\u2019s name separate from mention of crashed UFOs and Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARV). This exploration seeks to unveil SAIC and analyze possible engagement with UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs.</p> <p>This video seeks to break down SAIC investigations into a handful of major categories: SAIC Gatekeepers, Black Budget Money, Exotic Projects, and the Off-World Technologies Division.</p> <p>Does SAIC house TUOs in various Naval Centers around the continental United States? Has SAIC historically served as the premier corporate-facing gatekeeper to UFO programs? Does SAIC\u2019s history of fraud and obfuscation of funds lead to possible UFO legacy operations? Finally, why has SAIC engaged in studies into psychic phenomena and exotic, anti-gravity propulsion methods?</p> <p>If you have any first-hand experience or direct knowledge of UFO material exploitation and crash retrieval programs, please contact: UAPGERB@protonmail.com</p> <p>Support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/c/UAPGerb</p> <p>Previous Work Referenced: - US Navy UFO Crash Retrieval &amp; Reverse Engineering Programs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GSqOEvoBE&amp;t=773s - UFO Legacy Programs - Northrop Grumman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-GleS2aGj0&amp;t=641s - Off-World Technologies Division \u2013 UAP Technology Reverse Engineering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ215I85d5M -  Alien Reproduction Vehicle - TR-3B and the Flying Triangles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7JP0uX0GwY&amp;t=3286s - UAP Reverse Engineering at Edwards Air Force Base [Redacted List Vol.2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LSMLGBDNg&amp;t=1932s - UFOs in the Private Sector - Battelle Memorial Institute: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISTJRPOqFo&amp;t=876s</p> <p>ALL RESEARCH LINKS FOR PROJECT WILL BE UPLOADED VIA PDF FORMAT</p> <p>0:00 INTRODUCTION 06:48 SAIC/LEIDOS 24:58 SAIC GATEKEEPERS 48:13 BLACK BUDGET MONIES  01:30:23 SAIC EXOTIC PROJECTS 01:46:20 OFF-WORLD TECHNOLOGIES DIVISION</p> <p>THIS VIDEO IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

These whistleblowers can be of ironclad reputation like David Grusch, bound by legal testimony like Robert Salas, or have interesting stories with no real evidence like Bob Lazar.</p> <p>Today's video focuses on two former US Army veterans - 1st Lt. Walter Haut and white House Signaling Agency Army Technician Stephen Loveking.</p> <p>Haut served as the public relations officer for the 509th Bomb Group out of Roswell Army Air Field during 1947. His testimony surrounds the most famous and discussed alleged UFO crash in human history - the Roswell crash. Haut's two signed affidavits and other relevant testimony help to paint a picture of how the USG and General Ramey reacted to and changed the narrative around Roswell to that of a recovered Weather Balloon. Haut additionally has astonishing first-hand encounters of the Roswell wreckage, craft, and beings recovered....</p> <p>Stephen Lovekin served in the White House Signaling Agency during the terms of Eisenhower and Kennedy. During his time close to the White House, Lovekin gained key insights into the interworkings of Project Blue Book, and how the public, declassified report reflected none of the images, cases, terminology, etc that made its way to the public. Lovekin also claims to have first-hand experience with wreckage and bodies from the 1947 Roswell Crash. Lovekin's testimony can help shed light on the famous speech surrounding the \"Military Industrial Complex\" by Eisenhower. He claims that once read into the UAP estimate, Eisenhower was phased out of USG UFO programs. This is where the legacy program Grusch speaks of spiraled out of control, free of congressional oversight. </p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:45 1st.

This case has a tremendously fascinating story and rich lore dating back to the Fascist Regime of Benito Mussolini.</p> <p>Italian UFO Researcher Roberto Pinotti came into possession of official fascist internal documents in the late 90s that spelled out the story of the Magenta UAP collection. These documents included telegrams, memorandums, and handwritten notes that tell of the sophisticated disinformation tactics utilized to keep the UFO retrieval secret as well as the establishment of a scientific coalition codenamed the RS/33. This secret group tasked with the scientific study of the crashed OR landed UFO is strangely reminiscent of the alleged MJ12 documents that would appear decades later. </p> <p>In addition to the Telegrams and memorandums highlighting the RS/33 involvement with the case, handwritten notes and official documents are included on Italian UFO sightings between 1933 and 1940; specifically a case of a cigar-shaped UAP followed by two flying saucers. Interestingly, these notes address Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law and suspected member of the RS/33.</p> <p>The conspiracy here deepens with allegations Pope Pius XXII informed the US of the craft's existence as well as the hiding of the craft within Mussolini's famous bunker under Mount Soratte.</p> <p>This video seeks to investigate the paper trail of the Magenta, Italy 1933 craft to investigate the full, and true story.</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:48 The Story 4:32 Telegrams 7:01 RS/33 10:29 Protocol Memorandum 13:20 Craft Storage 14:27 Italian UFO Reports 19:02 Stefani Disinformation 19:53 Vatican Connection  21:07 Lue Elizondo 23:04 Conclusion</p> <p>Magenta, the Story: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12252381/Italian-researcher-shares-evidence-files-secret-UFO-crash-Italy.html</p> <p>Black Vault Coverage: https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/the-ufo-files-of-mussolini-fascist-ufo-files-by-roberto-pinotti/</p> <p>Reddit Telegram Reuploads: https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15j8k3t/david_grusch_gave_us_a_hint_1933_italy_ufo_crash/ https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14desdy/whistleblower_david_grusch_and_the_italian_ufo/</p> <p>Best Coverage of Magenta (Translate Required): https://www.silverland.info/documenti/gabinetto-rs-33/</p> <p>Note Transcription: https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15kcwkt/1933_italy_ufo_crash_report_translated/</p> <p>Agenzia Stefani: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenzia_Stefani</p> <p>Facist Document Comparisson:  https://web.archive.org/web/20230806011212/https://www.icharta.com/media/catalog/product/cache/69a51cc83c75c6910294c3bc195e645e/c/-/c-216721-1.jpg   </p> <p>Lue Elizondo Discussion (1:14:22-1:26:10): - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqtSWD6PYW8  </p> <p>Bunker Soratte:  https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/mussolinis-massive-bunker-built-wwii.html  https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunker-soratte </p> <p>Liberation Times \"All UFO Disclosure Roads Lead to Rome\": https://www.liberationtimes.com/home/disclosure-road-leads-to-rome</p> <p>Galeazzo Ciano: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeazzo_Ciano</p> <p>Guglielmo Marconi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi</p> <p>Old Italian Forum on RS/33 and Magenta Crash: https://web.archive.org/web/20070819053025/http://www.zonamagica.net/filesfascisti.htm </p> <p>Sunday June 17 1933 Meteor: http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,7/articleid,1143_01_1933_0144A_0007_24395130/anews,true/ https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15efnyu/investigation_into_the_1933_magenta_italy_ufo/</p> <p>De Santi: https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31280627315&amp;cm_sp=snippet--srp1--tile8&amp;searchurl=an%3DPETACCO%252C%2BARRIGO%26ds%3D10%26sortby%3D17</p> <p>Ciano Dairies: https://archive.org/stream/GibsonHughTheCianoDiaries19391943TheCompleteUnabridgedDiariesOfCountGaleazzoCian/Gibson%2C+Hugh+-+The+Ciano+Diaries+1939-1943+The+Complete%2C+Unabridged+Diaries+of+Count+Galeazzo+Ciano%2C+Italian+Minister+of+Foreign+Affairs%2C+1936-1943_djvu.txt</p> <p>Tomasso David: https://inpartibusinfidelium.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/tommaso-david-da-fascista-a-neofascista/ </p> <p>Paolo Guizzardi Translations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32UFw_6EiME&amp;t=817s</p> <p>Chiles-Whitted Encounter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiles-Whitted_UFO_encounter </p> <p>Music by the always talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/FGiwgyLY7Aw/#ufo-uap-uapnukes-uapdisclosure-ufology-ufonews-ufosightings-uapsightings-ufofootage-uapfootage-hynek-condoncomittee-jallenhynek-projectsign-projectgrudge-projectbluebook-bluebook-ufocongress-sol-solfoundation-karlnell-battelle-uforeverseengineering-lockheed-skunkworks-lockheedmartin-rosscoulthart-fastwalker-blackvault-slowwalker-kingman-ufocrash-nickredfern-grusch-magenta","title":"ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker #kingman #ufocrash #nickredfern #Grusch #Magenta","text":""},{"location":"video-pages/FGiwgyLY7Aw/#transcript","title":"Transcript","text":"<p>Transcript coming soon (pending local Whisper run).</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/H9GSqOEvoBE/","title":"US Navy UFO Crash Retrieval &amp; Reverse Engineering Programs","text":"<p>Published: 2025-04-11  \u00b7  Duration: 1:45:52  \u00b7  Channel: UAP Gerb</p> Description <p>A Deep dive into the U.S. Navy and UFO Legacy Programs.

While Castle and his fellow VMA-513 Marines were performing overnight AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval duties, the men were sent to investigate \"unidentified flare activity\".</p> <p>When rounding a hill near Emerson Dry Lake, the marines encountered an enormous, 200-300 foot, equilateral black triangular craft hovering only 150-200 feet off the ground. Below the triangle, solely 150-200 feet from Castle and the VMA-513 marines, stood a retainer of 30 men and 5-6 tactical vehicles.</p> <p>The men were outfitted in all black gear and heavily armed with no insignia, name tags, identifiable markings, etc. As soon as the USMC Marines encountered the craft and team in their Humvee, half of the retainer of Black Operators quickly swarmed and detained the Marines at gunpoint, barking orders at the soldiers to keep their heads down under threats of death.</p> <p>While being detained, Castle observed the triangle dart off towards the Northwest at incomprehensible speeds.... The Triangle featured no visible signs of propulsion and gave off no sounds or identifiable thrust or heat signatures. </p> <p>Castle reached out to David Grusch in early 2025, prepared to swear his testimony in before Congress.</p> <p>This project seeks to analyze the who, what, when, where, and why of Castle's encounter and analyze why this incredible, logic-defying triangle is indeed an Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV).</p> <p>Support me on Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/c/UAPGerb  Follow me on Twitter: https://x.com/UAPGERB</p> <p>Previous Work Referenced: - The 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO Crash Retrieval: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJxbyu-9Tj0&amp;t=8378s -  UFO Legacy Programs - Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p99lTsC7wQ&amp;t=7673s -  1997 Peru UFO Crash Retrieval - the Story of Jonathan Weygandt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jc2G5aEH0A&amp;t=6915s -  US Navy UFO Crash Retrieval &amp; Reverse Engineering Programs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GSqOEvoBE - UAP Reverse Engineering at Edwards Air Force Base [Redacted List Vol.2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LSMLGBDNg&amp;t=22s - Alien Reproduction Vehicle - TR-3B and the Flying Triangles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7JP0uX0GwY&amp;t=113s - Alien Reproduction Vehicle - the Testimony of Mark McCandlish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF07QMm6joE&amp;t=56s -  Michael Herrera - Insights into UAP Encounter and Black Program Insiders: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EMO38JUfVE&amp;t=1368s</p> <p>UAP GERB ACRONYM LIST: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riL6jgIKqCWmHW7AdZZEb9qlAAjyrBVY/view?usp=sharing</p> <p>0:00 INTRO 10:43 R.J.

The terms Fastwalker and Slowwalker have conveniently been utilized by USNORTHCOM and NORAD to avoid any sort of declassification through FOIA requests or other means by Executive Order.</p> <p>In this video, we will cover 3 instances in which NORAD, Space Force, and the USG denied access to data on fastwalkers and UFOs in space. The Trail does not end here, however. NORAD's interest in UAP was outed by the infamous J. Allen Hynek in the 60s. Fastwalkers also appear within the 2016 Hillary Clinton email leaks where communications between campaign manager John Podesta and USG Contractor Bob Fish. Fish discusses the Defense Support Program's (DSP) role in monitoring UFO/UAP/Fastwalker. </p> <p>Following down this rabbit hole we can stumble onto 2 shocking cases allegedly involving UAP detection from DSP - one UFO performing impossible maneuvers in space, and another offering confirmation to the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. </p> <p>The Rabbit Hole of DSP and Fastwalkers goes deeper with ties to the Aerospace Corporation, one of the companies suggested by Jacques Vallee and Ross Coulthart participating in \"real\" UFO research. </p> <p>0:00 Intro 0:59 Terminology  1:37 Greenwald FOIA Denial 3:42 1979 NORAD FOIA Denial 4:47 Orbit Determination of Sunlight Illuminated Objects Detected By Overhead Platforms 5:53 Defense Support Program  6:22 Space Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging Passive Sensors 7:59 Leaked Fastwalker Emails 10:58 1984 Fastwalker DSP Case 14:05 1976 Tehran UFO DSP Connection 19:54 The Aerospace Corporation  20:24 Conclusion </p> <p>2023 Black Vault FOIA Denial: https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/space-force-says-documents-on-fastwalkers-and-slowwalkers-all-exempt-from-disclosure/ </p> <p>FOIA Exemption 1: https://www.justice.gov/archive/oip/foia_guide09/exemption1.pdf</p> <p>Black Vault 2013 Fastwalker NORAD Denial: https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/fastwalkers/FY14-19NOV2013-07.pdf  </p> <p>Orbit Determination of Sunlight Illuminated Objects Detected By Overhead Platforms: https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/fastwalkers/a209227.pdf </p> <p>Space Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging Passive Sensors: https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/fastwalkers/ADA478890.pdf </p> <p>Clear intent: the government coverup of the UFO experience: https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/mode/2up</p> <p>Podesta Fish Email: https://web.archive.org/web/20200501044117/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54211 </p> <p>2014 DSP Fact Sheet: https://web.archive.org/web/20140720060107/http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5323 </p> <p>Ross Coulthart on Fish: https://www.ufojoe.net/bob-fish/</p> <p>TOP SECRET SPY SATELLITES SPOT UFOS Mentioned By Fish: https://web.archive.org/web/20180102111818/http://ufodigest.com/shadowmag/extra/topsecret.html</p> <p>Space Force X DSP: https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/2197774/defense-support-program-satellites/ </p> <p>1984 Fastwalker: https://web.archive.org/web/20040225055544/http:/www.debshome.com/FastWalker.html</p> <p>NICAP 1985 Fastwalker Report: https://www.nicap.org/reports/840505orbit_report.htm</p> <p>Cosmic Conspiracy: Part Five, The 80s Six Decades of Government UFO Cover-Ups: https://web.archive.org/web/20030308070428/http:/www.anomalies.net/ufo/gov/dsp/</p> <p>Joe Stefula: https://www.vlm.cem.va.gov/JOSEPHJOHNSTEFULA/5EEC8</p> <p>NICAP 1976 Tehran: https://www.nicap.org/760919tehran_dir.htm</p> <p>DSP Connection Email: https://web.archive.org/web/20060615035006/http:/www.virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/1998/apr/m05-009.shtml</p> <p>Tehran DSP Image: https://web.archive.org/web/19990428103840/http:/ufo-world.simplenet.com/iran_dsp.html</p> <p>Tehran DSP Claims Controversy: https://web.archive.org/web/20060717010735/https:/www.cohenufo.org/dsp_claims.html</p> <p>Music By the Always Talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/Tubx-CaAaOs/#ufo-uap-uapnukes-uapdisclosure-ufology-ufonews-ufosightings-uapsightings-ufofootage-uapfootage-hynek-condoncomittee-jallenhynek-projectsign-projectgrudge-projectbluebook-bluebook-ufocongress-sol-solfoundation-karlnell-battelle-uforeverseengineering-lockheed-skunkworks-lockheedmartin-rosscoulthart-fastwalker-blackvault-slowwalker","title":"ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker","text":""},{"location":"video-pages/Tubx-CaAaOs/#transcript","title":"Transcript","text":"<p>Transcript coming soon (pending local Whisper run).</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/U-jrx_giINA/","title":"USO - Unidentified Submerged Objects","text":"<p>Published: 2024-04-17  \u00b7  Duration: 26:29  \u00b7  Channel: UAP Gerb</p> Description <p>A deep dive into UFOs understudied brethren - the unidentified submerged object. This video seeks to uncover the history of USO study within the United States Government, secret and public.

Similar to UFOs and flying discs, the USG took sightings of these craft extremely seriously, but restricted and even hid reporting of sightings. </p> <p>00:00 Intro 02:20 USO HISTORY 07:05 USO CLAIMS 10:30 REAR ADMIRAL TIMOTHY GALLAUDET 16:39 MILITARY USO ENCOUNTERS 21:04 USS TREPANG IMAGES 24:42 CONCLUSION</p> <p>Dewey Fournet Operation Interloper: https://www.ufoexplorations.com/_files/ugd/aa4aac_a0261f418177495ca81a5c831721b607.pdf  http://www.nicap.org/docs/bethune_nicapfile_02.pdf </p> <p>AFOIN-X(SG) 9 Undersea Encounters (pg 145): https://archive.org/details/needtoknow00good/page/145/mode/1up </p> <p>Rupplet Documents: https://web.archive.org/web/20211130015126/http://www.nicap.org/match/papers/PentagoReportNotNews.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20211130015350/https://www.nicap.org/docs/520103-Garland-memo-to-Samford.pdf  https://archive.org/details/reportonunidenti00rupp/mode/1up</p> <p>CUFON FOIA Requests: http://textfiles.com/ufo/cufon5.txt</p> <p>JANAP146(C) : https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/ufo/janap_146.pdf  https://www.cufon.org/cufon/janp146c.htm https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/282/mode/2up</p> <p>Donald Keyhoe Flying Saucer Conspiracy: http://www.nicap.org/books/fsc/flying-saucer-conspiracy.pdf </p> <p>Marc Dantonio:  https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4487506/us-navy-is-running-top-secret-programme-to-detect-alien-spacecraft-under-the-ocean-ufo-expert-claims/ </p> <p>Oke Shannon Notes: https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Documents/0%20-%20UFO%20Researchers/Grant%20Cameron/A dvanced%20Theoretical%20Physics%20WG/Oke%20Shannon/pdf/ATPWG%20-%20notes%20b y%20Oke%20Shannon%20-%20SSN%20redacted.pdf</p> <p>Ex CIA John Ramirez: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku9GsJ94Dt4  https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/files/org-chart.png </p> <p>Timothy Gallaudet News Nation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M01DWnEQeSI</p> <p>Timothy Gallaudet Chris Lehto: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_UsFX0op8k</p> <p>Timothy Gallaudet SoCal Anomoly: https://twitter.com/GallaudetTim/status/1767899315798753391 </p> <p>Lue Elizondo Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YSrVhCS-rc</p> <p>USS Nimitz Kevin Thomas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sjLyFrBBkw</p> <p>Baughman Tic Tac UFO: https://medium.com/on-the-trail-of-the-saucers/new-navy-witness-says-he-saw-a-tic-tac-operating-underwater-92344d29ac1 </p> <p>USS Trepang Black Vault Analysis &amp; Images: https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/arctic-ufo-photographs-uss-trepang-ssn-674-march-1971/ </p> <p>USS Trepang: https://www.hullnumber.com/SSN-674 </p> <p>Fata Morgana: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_(mirage)</p> <p>Music By: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg https://www.youtube.com/@UCacamYVDLEtG00SWmJuR8qw  https://www.youtube.com/@hurricanebeatz-ysm/videos</p> <p>Thumbnail Original Artwork: https://www.reddit.com/user/GodDestroyer/</p> <p>THIS VIDEO IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY!

Tic Tac or cigar-shaped objects are often seen hovering just above the water's surface, often gyrating or quivering. Luminous balls of light are seen rising from the depths to perform what seem like curious maneuvers, hovering by a vessel before returning to sea or shooting off into the distance. Egg-shaped or elliptical craft are often seen entering or leaving the oceans.

This project seeks to leave his 1997 book \"Day After Roswell\" behind and study solely Corso's manuscript \"Dawn of a New Age\" as the best-selling book has numerous details and fluff added, likely by the book's co-writer, missing in the manuscript.</p> <p>Are Corso's claims of a US Army UFO legacy program seeding non-human technologies into US industry and armed forces indeed true?

Dugway is host to two DOD Major Range Test and Facility Bases (MRTFB) - the Army West Desert Test Center, and the southern range of the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR). MRTFBs serve as the DOD's \"critical core\" for all test and evaluation of military vehicles, equipment, and weaponry.</p> <p>This investigation harnesses the witness testimony of one M.S. who incidentally stumbled on a clandestine group of scientists and armed personnel engaging with a non-human craft in the Dugway Avery Region.

This event has inspired a small town in midwest America to build a monument and hold a yearly festival for the acorn-shaped craft that allegedly crashed one winter's afternoon in 1965.</p> <p>Kecksburg offers one of the most complete, intriguing, and credible UFO crash retrieval stories of all time, featuring decades of rich investigation by Stan Gordon and Leanord Stringfield, a wealth of first-hand civilian witnesses, a mysterious and lacking blue book report, possible involvement from US President Lyndon B. Johnson, and a legal case won against NASA who supposedly lost files on the craft's recovery in 1975. Next to Roswell, Kecksburg is by far the US's most complete and rich crash retrieval story.</p> <p>The craft allegedly recovered at Kecksburg features an incredibly unique description: 10-12 feet tall, 8-10 feet wide, metallic almost a dull brass color, no visible signs of propulsion/landing gear/windows, and strange, almost hieroglyphic writing around the base. </p> <p>Does the Keckbusrg case feature a mix of a landed meteor and nothing as claimed by Blue Book, a soviet space capsule as claimed by numerous skeptics, or was the crash indeed a craft of non-human intelligence? </p> <p>0:00 Intro 01:30 The Crash 13:24 The Witnesses 27:28 The Craft 38:49 Dr. Eric A.

Wood.</p> <p>The Majestic-12 is a highly debated, well-known group of alleged scientists and military personnel tasked with UFO recovery, reverse engineering, analysis, and disinformation. The MJ-12 was brought to light from a series of contested leaked documents discussing the group. During 1984-1999, over 109 documents containing 3,500 pages were leaked to UFO researchers detailing the shadowy organization and its members. From Generals such as Nathan Twinning to scientists like Dr. Vannevar Bush and J. Robert Oppenheimer, the MJ-12 has allegedly included some of the 20th century's best and brightest. </p> <p>Debate has raged on for decades but respected UFO researchers Stanton Friedman and Ryan/Robert Wood have argued for the authenticity of many of the documents and the MJ-12 group due to decades of rigorous study on the documents' context, provenance, discussion, and connective tissue to other MJ-12 Documents and declassified documents. </p> <p>The MJ12 has long been considered a conspiracy especially after a haphazard and lazy debunk by the FBI. But are there clues in the Majestic-12 documents that can help us assemble pieces to discover the reality behind the infamous group? Join Mr. Wood and myself as we discuss over 30 documents and dive into the enigmatic group that is the MJ-12!</p> <p>NOTE: All Majestic documents referenced can be found on majesticdocuments.com.

Sorensen was wrongfully permitted access to a \"special exhibit\" at the November 12th, 1988 Norton Air Force Base air show.  Brad had witnessed strange craft - the losing competitor to the B2 Bomber, small hovercraft technology, and a flattened-out football known as the Lockheed Aurora.</p> <p>A secondary display showed three flying saucers known as Alien Reproduction Vehicles nicknamed \"Flux Liners\". The craft was capable of beyond-light speeds and had been reverse-engineered from off-shelf components from technology recovered from nonhuman intelligence.  </p> <p>Let's dive into the story of the flux liner, the physics behind the craft, other sightings of the craft, and most importantly, a long-forgotten 1990 interview with primary witness Brad Sorensen who not only confirms the ARVs, but adds even more astounding details.</p> <p>0:00 Intro 03:39 Mark McCandlish &amp; Brad Sorensen 11:28 Alien Reproduction Vehicle 19:39 Brad's Story 32:06 McCandlish's ARV Investigation 54:59 The Fate of Mark McCandlish 1:00:00 Conclusion</p> <p>Blueprint for a UFO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua0MMXJl3FM</p> <p>McCandlish press club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DrcG7VGgQU&amp;t=4408s </p> <p>2014 Zero Point Documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afLsRsd5roY </p> <p>Mark's Death: https://gizadeathstar.com/2021/05/the-sad-and-mysterious-death-of-ufologist-mark-mccandlish/ </p> <p>Interview with Mark: https://ufospotlight.org/2021/05/10/an-interview-with-ufo-ssp-whistleblower-mark-mccandlish-on-advanced-energy-propulsion/ </p> <p>2015 Secret Space Program: Another video to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9smlCLjXoU&amp;t=1314s </p> <p>Reality Check W/ Michael Shellenberger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxyUoDvdGhg</p> <p>Gary McKinnon:  - https://web.archive.org/web/20160306030249/https://www.wired.com/2006/06/ufo-hacker-tells-what-he-found/  - https://web.archive.org/web/20061024221521/http://bbcworld.com/content/clickonline_archive_18_2006.asp?pageid=665&amp;co_pageid=4 </p> <p>LANL Explosive Magnetic Flux Compression Generators: https://cyberwar.nl/d/1975_EMP_An-Introduction-to-Explosive-Magnetic-Flux-Compression-Generators.pdf </p> <p>Amy Eskridge: https://x.com/Alien_Scientist/status/1306981668419301379?t=sRPqtty0yk952ZsgEJa+Zww</p> <p>Moultrie: https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3249303/usdis-ronald-moultrie-and-dr-sean-kirkpatrick-media-roundtable-on-the-all-domai/ </p> <p>FOUCHE:  - http://checktheevidencecom.ipage.com/checktheevidence.com/pdf/TR-3B%20questions%20and%20Answers.pdf  - https://alienscientist.com/fouche.html </p> <p>NASA X-43: https://aviex.goflexair.com/blog/fastest-planes-in-the-world#:~:text=The%20NASA%20X%2D43%20holds,of%20air%2Dbreathing%20scramjet%20engines. </p> <p>THIS VIDEO IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY!

Historically, mentioning a UAP sighting by a commercial or military pilot has been a death sentence, and politicians/military personnel avoid any mention of unidentified craft to maintain \"sound mind\".</p> <p>But where and why did this stigma begin? Was it conducted purposefully to alter public perception of the phenomena? In today's video, we will walk through the carefully conducted disinformation campaign orchestrated by the USG, CIA, and USG Military throughout the 1950s and 1960s to lump the study of UFO and \"flying saucer\" with the likes of paranormal topics such as ghosts, bigfoot, Illuminati conspiracy, etc. </p> <p>By leveraging the USG and USAF official UFO investigation studies - Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book, as well as orchestrating the famous Robertson Panel and Condon Committee, all scientific investigation ability was stripped of UFOs and the subject became pseudoscience. </p> <p>Of course, we know even with the termination of Project Blue Book in 1969, the USG maintained rigid study into UFO until the present day.... </p> <p>0:00 Intro 2:50 Project Sign 4:29 Project Grudge 5:57 Project Blue Book 8:16 Lt.
