Although the channel has covered the UAP subject in the past, this entry stood out entirely.\nThe video covers the testimony of an individual who encountered a crashed UAP while serving in\nVietnam. With engaging storytelling and mesmerizing animations, the Infographics team highlights how\nthis sighting saw the soldier read into covert UAP operations and details his work on the program.\nAstonishing details of UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering are highlighted in this\naccount very similar to the claims of David Grush. I'm sure many people saw this video,\nenjoyed it, and moved on. Just as many watched it and thought, huh, I wonder if this is real.\nBut the narrator starts this video with a statement that almost forces us to analyze the\nentire video line by line. Note, the following is based on testimony provided over a series of\ninterviews and written correspondence, edited and cut together in an attempt to create a cohesive\ntimeline of the events as described. Do these events recount the experience of a real anonymous\nwhistleblower? Is this story rooted in fact, and are there elements we can verify? And why did he\nspeak to the Infographics show? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you for joining me as we conduct\na full breakdown and analysis of the Infographics show's US Special Forces Confession, I Recovered\nUFOs. Since its release, I have played this testimony over and over and over in my head.\nIs it possible that these events and details recount the true testimony of someone on a UFO\ncrash retrieval program? I think it is well worth investigating their story. Searching for holes or\nconfirmable elements, because this could very well be the most crucial first-hand whistleblower of all time.\nTo start, our witness states, and I will be calling him our witness for the duration of this video,\nthat our story begins in 1968, during the Vietnam conflict along the Vietnam-Kimbodia border.\nBefore we get into his story, we do have two interesting Vietnam cases that may be contextually\nrelevant to our Infographics whistleblower. We can check in on the ever-relevant Stephen\nGreer redacted witness log to analyze the statements and emails of witness 10622.\n10622 served as CTR Communication Technician Radio in the US Navy from 1966 to 1970,\non the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier. It was in June of 1968 on official duties,\nhe received scrambled messages mentioning at least 11 UAP were tracked on visual and radar.\nAnd on September 9, 1968, several US helicopter pilots and soldiers stationed at a Marine Corps\nbase in Dong Ha, Vietnam had a close encounter with a fast-moving object. This object had green\nand white lights and engaged in maneuvers for 20 minutes. Anyways, our witness states his US military\nunit was performing an LRRP, a long-range reconnaissance patrol tracking supply routes into\nSouth Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as marking out sites for a B-52 bombing raid the following year.\nThis tiny snippet in the video gives us so much to unpack. The following year of 1969,\na covert bombing raid did in fact occur. On March 18, 1969, the Strategic Air Command commenced\nOperation Menu, not declassified until 2000 by President Bill Clinton. Operation Menu was a year\nlong B-52 bombing campaign that ravaged Eastern Cambodia, and that mention LRRP may be one of\nthe most significant pieces to solving this puzzle. Long-range reconnaissance patrol was a special\nunit acting in Vietnam, Company E 52nd Infantry, attached to the 1st Calvary Division in the\nUS Army. This unit operated in Vietnam from 1967 to 1969, well within the time frame of our witness\nand participated in two of the largest battles of Vietnam, the Tet Offensive and Siege of Que Son.\nIn late October of 1968, Company E 52nd Infantry was relocated and headquartered at Phuoc Vinh,\nnorth of Vietnam. The division's area of operations was designated along the Cambodian border in\nTainin, Bin Long, and Phuoc Long provinces, all in South Vietnam. These areas contained\nsignificant routes for enemy infiltration into the Saigon area from Cambodia. So if our witness\nis telling the truth and this crash is real, this event occurred in October to December 1968 within\nthe Company E 52nd Infantry, LRRP, stationed out of Phuoc Vinh. So far, his testimony lines up exactly\nwith real events. And finally back to our story, a quote unquote object appeared overhead the witness\nin his platoon, emitting a bright red orange glow appearing to be melting. The object quickly moved\nout of sight, but only five or six seconds later, a large crash followed by a dull thump\nreverberated throughout the jungle. The platoon figured this must have been a US plane, so knowing\nbetter than to risk long range radio communications being intercepted by Soviet agents, they moved\nto secure the crash site. Arriving at the site, the platoon knew immediately this was not a US\nplane classified or acknowledged. The only prosaic explanation the soldiers could think of was a crash\nbase probe, something from NASA or the Soviets. The craft was egg shaped, dull gray and metallic,\nand seemingly cracked open. Again we see the description this craft appeared to be made\nfrom a single piece of metal with no bolts, seams, or screws. This sighting and craft description\ngive us a lot to work off of actually. What immediately stands out to me is this red orange\nglow the craft emanated while flying over the jungle. There are two cases within our crashes\ntimeframe that are worth mentioning that are similar to this. We can look to November 22nd\nof 1968 to NICAP case 681122. On this date in Albany, Georgia, a glowing yellow white oval UFO\nwas seen from a car, directed a light beam at the vehicle and flew away changing colors to red and\norange. And let's head to move France on December 15th 1968. Reported in a book translated as UFO,\nthe first complete file on close encounters in France. We can find a case where an egg shaped\nobject the size of a car moved quickly without making noise, emanating orange reflections.\nBut let's not forget an event that occurred just a year earlier on March 24th 1967 highlighted in\nthe sworn affidavits by Captain Robert Salas and others at Malmstrom Air Force Base. I covered this\ncase in my UFO and nukes video, but this event saw a red orange oval UAP appear over the base,\ndisabling the ICBMs of Malmstrom. And this mention of an egg shaped object comes up again and again\nin ufology. We will talk about this more later in the video with the witnesses experience within\nthe program. But let's look at the testimony of aerospace contractor Eric Taper to Aero,\nwho recounted an egg shaped metallic UFO being kept at Area 51 in the 1980s. The description\nof this craft is almost identical to the Vietnam encounter. And lastly, the molten feel of the\ncraft reminds me closely of the mother of pearl effect displayed on the skin of the craft Lance\nCorporal Jonathan Waygant claimed to have observed in the jungles of Peru in 1997.\nOur platoon of Marines called in the crash only to hear there were already birds in root and\nordered to secure the crash. Quickly, a pair of F4 jets fell into orbit overhead. The mention of\nthe McDonnell Douglas F4 Phantom II may seem small, but this is actually a huge detail in our\nstory. In June of 1986, former Betul Corps contractor James McCamble told ufology Jacques\nValais he met with a military contact with the wild weasels, a codename given by USAF for aircraft\nequipped with anti radiation missiles and tasked with the suppression of enemy air defenses in\nVietnam. This contractor told McCamble F4 jets were equipped with EM detection equipment to detect\nUAP during the war. Dr. Steven Greer may have an additional witness adding valuable context these\nclaims. Witness 10272 claims to have worked for a UK based contractor installing low observable\nradar assemblies on F4 fighters at area 51. Along with these claims, the witness alleges to have\nbeen involved in the evaluation of hardware from NHI craft. Anyways, infantry then touched down\nand acted in perimeter security, but I want to note the witness states they were allowed nowhere\nnear the craft. They were deployed in a wide swath. It took two days for the craft to be removed from\nthe jungle, all with the help of SOF, Special Operations Forces, Navy and Air Force officials\non site who had already been read into the program. The mention of the Air Force is no surprise here.\nEver since the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash and the involvement of USAF General Roger Raimi,\nthe Air Force has long been entwined with the study of UAP. Again, I would like to recommend\nmy Moondust video and USAF Document AFC-1E draft policy, which states Project UFO and Moondust,\nboth headquartered out of the Air Force, have collection responsibilities for UAP\nand descended foreign space vehicles. The Navy is a bit more interesting. Sure,\nwe have Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who speaks openly about UAP and OPNAV regulations to restrict\nUAP reporting I covered in my USO videos, but I can't help thinking about the Wilson Davis memo.\nAfter all, if this memo is true, which I fully believe it is, DIA Director and Vice Admiral\nThomas Wilson was Stonewalled from reading into the program. This was our witness's first ever\ninteraction with the program. Throughout Vietnam, several rapid reaction units were on standby\nfor retrieval purposes, and it's here the witness adds some interesting context.\nThat's what everyone called it, the program, and there were several rapid reaction units\nstationed throughout in theater. See, we learned from the Korean War that these things are attracted\nto conflict, and I guess that makes sense. It's probably one of the most interesting things we\ndo. A lot of people think this whole mess started in World War II, and maybe it did,\nbut the program got put together during the Korean War, and that's when it was official.\nThe Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953. While the first US-based retrieval of a UAP occurred in\nRoswell in 1947, it is possible the program took a few years to put together. If we are going to\nbelieve the MJ-12 documents, the program in charge of UAP investigation, crash retrieval,\nand reverse engineering, operated under US President Truman and briefed President Eisenhower\nwho took office in 1953. This means the program was put together during 1945 more like 1947 to 1950,\nfitting in nicely with the realm of the Korean War. We can of course guess the program was already\nimplemented by 1950 when senior radio engineer wrote to the Canadian Controller of Telecommunications\nin the Department of Transport stating the US was actively engaged in studying UAP in an effort\nso classified it rated even higher than the H-bomb. This information was provided to the\nengineer Wilbert B. Smith by physicist and member of the US Research and Development Board and\nstudent under Einstein, Robert Sarbacher. I highly recommend my video on this subject,\nas it very well may cover the early days of the program. The witness also states,\nthese things are attracted to conflict. Well, we know from numerous stories including\nRobert Salas and Mounds from Air Force Base, UAP have a direct interest in observing and interacting\nwith nuclear arms. We know from the testimony of Bob Jacobs, UAP have even an interest in dummy\nflights of ICBMs. And if the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash is true, let's remember this happening\nduring Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which oversaw extensive nuclear testing. It certainly looks like\nthey want to understand how far we've advanced in our nuclear fizzle kind of technologies at the\nvery least. I mean, it looks like preparatory probing activity. It might be innocent kind\nof scientific gathering. Could be ISR probing. Anyways, it was at this time the witness and\nhis fellow platoon mates were read into the program. Joining the program was by force.\nThe soldiers were faced with this or a general discharge. Likely drug charges are an Article\n15, which gives military commanders an easy way to punish minor infractions breaching military\nconduct. This draws my attention to an alleged crash retrieval that occurred on April 12, 1954,\nrelated to Leonard Stringfield by a witness K.A. You can read about this in Stringfield's UFO\ncrash retrieval status report three, amassing the evidence. And the link, of course, will be in the\ndescription. In this incident, K.A. and the USAF crew rescue four out of Roswell Air Force Base\nwere dispatched to a site 25 to 30 miles northwest where they observed a metallic saucer crashed\nedgewise into the sand with a dome in its center. A ground crew and fatigues was already at this\nsite prevented the men from getting closer and began tagging debris and scattered NHI bodies.\nK.A. returned to Roswell was debriefed for three days in a quote unquote living hell and told by\nmen identifying as intelligence officers in civilian clothes not to speak about the incident.\nReading to K.A. a law that referred to a fine imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge.\nOur witness states his introduction to the program was highly compartmentalized.\nHe was only told what he needed to know. This mirrors accurately the compartmentalization\ndiscussed in the Wilson Davis memo. The four programs that referred Admiral Wilson to the\nprogram were quote part of it in different compartments placed in different layers of\nthe compartment's pyramid split up to do different things of parts of it. It is interesting to hear\nour witness state I didn't even realize those damn things were from space until I actually saw a body.\nSo some of these craft are indeed from space and some are manned vessels. We know from my\nfast walker video there is factual evidence USG elements had a term for objects entering or\nleaving Earth's atmosphere denoted as fast walkers and defense support satellites were likely\nused to monitor these objects. And the subject of bodies can be pretty contentious but like David\nGruss said well naturally when you recover something that's either landed or crashed\nsometimes you encounter dead pilots and believe it or not as fan as fantastical as that sounds\nit's true. The witness states the more he figured out the more he was read into the program.\nHe never learned all the truth but knew enough he felt compelled to come forward especially as an\naging gentleman. Serving in Vietnam I would put this individual's age at around 74 or older\nand claiming he had been out of the program for 20 years means his service in the program\noccurred from around 1969 to 2004. The witness even discusses David Grush commenting on his\napproach to speaking publicly and labeling him a patriot. He even confirms the involvement of\naerospace contractors and sophisticated disinformation. I don't think we need to expand\non these topics too much in general as I have multiple videos exploring the full involvement\nof Lockheed Martin and Battelle Memorial Institute's interaction with UAP and fully covered the\nbirth of the UAP stigma. Check out those videos for some valuable context here. After being read\ninto the program the witness's unit was put back on duty but broken up and placed in horrific\ncombat engagements. Five of the original 12 died in combat. I know five of the original 12\ndied in combat. Three more badly wounded. I think they were trying to kill us off. If this broken\nup team still served with the first Calvary Division LRRP we may in fact be able to track these\nnames. Of the 1,000 men who served in this unit 45 were killed in Vietnam and Cambodia.\nAnd the witness states a year after the initial crash he was officially brought into the program\nwhere his primary job was no longer being a soldier but he was now part of the program.\nSo with this information we can conclude that these soldiers were killed between October to\nDecember of 1968 where the crash occurred and October to December of 1969 when he was brought\ninto the program and we'll give an error factor of around plus or minus let's say three months.\nI have actually found a memorial site dedicated to those served and fell in the LRRP unit within\nthe first Calvary Division. Analyzing the casualty list we can try and trace the deaths of these brave\nsoldiers from the time of our crash October to December 68 and our witness being read into the\nprogram October to December 1969. So we're left with 16 possible names. If we filter out soldiers\nwho died of non-hostile actions we are left with eight possible names. If our witness is telling the\ntruth five of eight of these names are likely platoon mates of his who observed the crashed\negg-shaped UAP. It didn't happen often but these things did fall out of the sky where people would\nsee something land or witness beings happening more often than people know and we'd swoop in as\nfast as we could in case there was anything to snatch up. I think we pulled three total\ncraft out of theater and not just Vietnam. Damn near started a war with China in one recovery.\nUp to three craft in Vietnam well perhaps there are others who can expand on this. Within\nStephen Greer's redacted witness list we return to again and again and again we find witness 10659\nquote first hand involvement in Vietnam crash slash retrieval of ET craft involved directly\nwith ET technology POC to other military UFO events including dad's presence at 1954 Edwards\nAir Force Base UFO landing. I do think this witness is separate from our infographics witness due to\nthe claims of dad's presence at a 1954 Edwards AFB landing. The witness comments how one retrieval\nalmost started a war with China the program only getting the upper hand due to China's primitive\nearly warning systems. David Grush has commented on this a multi-decade long cold war between the\nU.S. China and other U.S. adversaries. We're in a competition with their adversaries to understand\nthis and it's a it's a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long and\nyou know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states\naccountable if they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to the subject and I think\nthe up to secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where a country might make a\nbreakthrough let's say we that's an adversary of ours and it is so destabilizing. You say there's\nbeen a cold war behind the scenes with Russia and China. There has been a cold war against our\nwith our with our peer adversaries yeah. The witness also states recoveries in the ocean would be\nnear impossible that Europe was another hotspot for UFO activity. This was due to curiosity\ntowards the always militarized European mainland especially within the Cold War and a few decades\nremoved from World War two. Europe was able to keep a tighter lid on the subject especially with\nthe European populace quote turning their nose up at the whole UFO thing end quote.\nThe crafts themselves were extraordinary that's the only way to describe them I wasn't there for\nevery single recovery obviously but they kept collections of them in different places and\nI got to see two of the collections. The question of craft housing and material handling is done\nis always fascinating starting with a quote unquote collection of craft as we know from\nDavid Grush the USG is in possession of up to 12 to 15 craft. When you say crash retrieval what\ndo you mean? These are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles you know call it\nspacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed.\nWe have spacecraft from another species. We do yeah. How many? Quite a number. You're kidding.\nNo. These claims have been echoed by numerous whistleblowers including alleged S4 project\nAquarius biologist Dan Burish. Sit tight for a video on him but he claimed nine hangar bays housed\nUAP and reverse engineered vehicles including the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash at S4. The witness\nstates Wright Patterson and the foreign technology division is a red herring that this is where the\nSoviets would have immediately come looking quote we faked some stuff going into Wright Patterson\nand quote it's likely in the early days of the program Wright Pat housed both crashes and biological\nmaterial and we only have to look at Roswell to guess that this means that either before or during\nthe witness's tenure in the program program duty shifted away from the airbase and any sort of\nmaterial or crash hiding at Wright Pat from roughly 1969 to 2004 our hoax is perpetrated by\nthe program. Now there is some conflicting information here as I think back to the testimony\nof Senator Barry Goldwater who in 1975 was Stonewalled by General Curtis LeMay into accessing\nthe blue room at Wright Pat where UAP information and materials were likely stored. Possibly this\nmeans Wright Pat held a database or record of UAP and program activity but not actual materials\nand biologics. There were these co-opsites run by the government and the big defense contractors\npeople like Raytheon, Boeing, everyone knows their names but also people like Texas Instruments.\nIt was a whole umbrella but the little guys only got a tiny piece of the puzzle. Some guys from TI\nwould get a piece of something and then be asked to figure out how it works never being told where\nit came from and on its own I'm sure these eggheads had their suspicions but it's hard to tell if\nsomething's actually alien. Raytheon, Boeing, and Texas Instruments are specifically name dropped\nand we can infer TI is one of the quote-unquote little guys mentioned here as the witness proposes\nthe example of TI getting a little piece of something. Can we find one interesting connection\nfor each of these three companies? Well to start we can find Raytheon name drop specifically alongside\nLockheed Martin, Aerospace Corp, TRW, etc. by Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Haish\nas one of a major aerospace company in which the legacy UAP programs hide. In 1956,\nBoeing was mentioned in a special weapons study of aviation studies examination of\nelectro-gravity systems. This piece references a project winner haven which suggests construction\nof a saucer creating a local gravitational field designated to serve as a USAF interceptor.\nBoeing was one such company mentioned on working on these anti-gravity rigs.\nWhen we hear Texas Instruments we think of the TI-84 calculator that got me through college at\nleast I do. But TI also operates within the aerospace and defense industries. Unfortunately,\nthere is not much to confirm here as the only link to TI I can find is a 1961 establishment of the\nSouthwest Center for Advanced Studies by TI to work on gravitational physics.\nAnd finally on to everybody's favorite subject the craft. The witness makes a very curious\nclaim. Although he knows these craft can operate in a microgravity medium he does not know if they\nare really spacecraft and wonders if quote that's where they want us to think they are coming from\nend quote. The witness comments ufology has done a pretty good job at compiling craft shape.\nSo you got your flying eggs your tic-tacs I guess you now call them we just call them pills your\nold fashioned saucers bells triangles whole message shapes but the ones that crash are\nalmost always the eggs and the bells. In Aero's data from 1996 to 2023 we can actually find the\nmost commonly reported UAP configurations. Factoring out spheres and lights which in my opinion\noften have a more possible prosaic explanation than other configurations we can see commonly\ncited craft shapes accurately reflect our witnesses list. Eggs and bell shapes are the\nmost frequently crashed objects according to our witness sometimes disintegrating on impact\nand our witness claims these are likely unmanned drones. We have already covered some really\ninteresting and possibly credible eggs and oval shaped objects Eric Tabor and Jonathan Wagan.\nBut what about this bell there is a fascinating and perplexing case that occurred in 1965 in\nKecksburg Pennsylvania I plan to cover soon. Allegedly a bell shaped almost acorn object\ncrashed in the area. This case was covered extensively by Leonard Stringfield so if you'd\nlike to brush up before my video I recommend reading his UFO crash retrievals the inner sanctum\nstatus report 6 and if you remember from my Robert Sarbacher video Dr. Eric Walker an alleged\noriginal program manager claimed to have been on site and at location for this crashed object.\nOur witness declares the saucers are the crown jewels and he only ever participated in the\nrecovery of two such craft. I probably don't need to dive too much into the importance of\ndiscs or saucers in UFO lore but let's see if we can investigate the witnesses aid in a crash\nretrieval in South America. The saucer we recovered and hit the side of a rocky outcropping on its\nway down it smashed the rock to pieces then took out a quarter mile of trees if it had happened\non the outskirts of civilization the whole UFO mystery would have been public knowledge by now\nthat's how much destruction that thing cost but the craft itself was relatively unharmed.\nI will be using the date frame 1969 to 2004 I derived earlier for our witnesses time in the\nprogram. I can find three relevant cases for my all-time favorite crash retrieval handbook\nMagic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood. We will not be covering the 1997 Jonathan Wagan Peru case\nor the 1978 Moondust retrieval in Bolivia as these craft are explicitly stated as not saucer-like.\nOne example can be found that was also relayed in the notes of Leonard Stringfield dated March\n23rd 1978. In his notes Stringfield spoke with one Bob Berry who claimed a UFO crash retrieval\noccurred on November 11th 1975. Berry close to Lima Peru this craft was unmanned and measured 12\nfeet high and 8 feet in diameter. If what our witnesses saying is true and mostly egg slash\nbells are unmanned this may not be a saucer but still worth mentioning the outer surface was\nmetallic with material deemed to be non-terrestrial. Another possible event occurred in Potorio's\nChile 1978 pulled from the files of Bob Pratt also he learned while in the area a year later\na tremendous explosion occurred that woke up all 3,000 people in the area all houses shook and\neveryone thought a blast furnace had exploded. Engineers determined the event was an air burst\nthe explosion occurred in the air and the blast force exerted downwards. Following the crash\nAmerican operatives and NASA coveralls arrived at the scene questioning witnesses. An American or\nSoviet spacecraft maybe but when Bob Pratt filed FOIA request to NASA and the CIA they responded\nthey had no data on the event. And we can find a third case that's also mentioned in Stringfield's\nUFO crash retrieval syndrome status report two new sources new data which discusses an October 3rd\n1980 saucer crash in Piedra de la Gu\u00eda, Argentina. Here witnesses in a 300 mile radius saw what\nappeared to be a saucer shaped fireball come down from the skies and explode near 7 p.m. Some\nwitnesses claim the fireball flew in circles before crashing exhibiting intelligent control.\nCaptain Carlos Lima then head of the space research division of the Argentinian Air Force\nofficially investigated the incident he found four burned spots circular and 10 to 18 meters in\ndiameter and notice what appeared quote to be the product of combustion originated by liquid fuel\nor some sort of material with a very high temperature end quote could any of these cases are possibly\nthe Varginia Brazil case so excellently covered by James Fox be the crash our witness mentioned\nwhen the witness reached the administrative side of the program he learned saucers were formed from\na single piece of material or put together at an atomic level quote even the entrance is invisible\nuntil it actually opens and quote but interiors could be accessed through destructive and non\ndestructive means I have recently covered two witnesses whose claims mirror these statements\nidentically MS who declared the UFO he observed undergoing inspections at Dugway Proving Ground\nwas quote flawless like it had been 3d printed and RB who claimed the saucer he guarded in\n1963 had a door panel with tolerances so tight not even a piece of paper could fit through the seams\nthe first mention of biologics comes with the South American saucer retrieval\nonce access was gained to the craft the interior reeked of decaying organic material the quote\nunquote things inside were dead I call them things on purpose not out of disrespect or anything like\nthat I just don't think any of us were ever convinced they were actually living creatures\nwell not in the sense that you and I are these biologics featured a crude digestive system\nonly enough to process basic proteins and such leading the witness and program to believe these\nthings were similar to biological androids the typical gray alien depicted in media is\nallegedly accurate but these beings are a little taller than the famous humanoids and possess\nlarge but not massive eyes the witness remarks how these beings were raised in a dimly lit\nenvironment supported by their dimly lit craft these creatures feature long limbs and knees\nquote not in the right places end quote the subject of almost android like living beings has been\nechoed by many including dr gary nolyn I think that part of what we are seeing here I mean look\nif you're an intelligence are you gonna go down on a planet with a bunch of angry monkeys\nwho might kill you no unlikely you'll send some intermediary well what kind of intermediary\nyou're gonna send you're gonna send something that maybe almost looks like them but isn't them\nso I think and this is again from inside the intelligence community most of what we think\nwe're seeing are avatars biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions\nif you will and that's that's the current view of that's a that is a it is a hypothesis living\nby a logics had been recovered by our witness specifically at a near UK based retrieval this\nevent occurred at the same time of a meteor strike in the UK area and I actually think I may have\nfound this incident this story occurred in May of 1996 in Boyle Ireland locals witnessed a meteor\nor an aerial craft heading towards land appearing to misjudge its approach shearing trees and landing\nin the lake allegedly several occupants were taken into custody by a retrieval team and significant\nmilitary activity including American soldiers continued for the following six months even\nlocal police were instructed to stay away the American soldier bit here is key as our witness\nstates Europe has a default agreement with the United States that recovered materials go to the\nUS but quote that's the price you pay for having a superpower watch your back at this crash site\nthe witness states two of five of the craft's crew survived light bruising covered the dead from\nthe hard landing the program has ruthlessly strict protocols for dealing with live biologics\naccording to our witness these rules include never leveling a weapon at a bean and for that matter\nsecurity is positioned well away and out of sight from the biologics immediately taking\nreadings to ensure nothing toxic or hazardous is present near the craft and medical personnel\nare then sent to the craft area or interior including the lead doctor known as the ambassador\nwho always spoke at least english chinese spanish and russian the biologics at this uk crash just\nstood around aimlessly solely reacting to basic stimuli as the team entered the craft after the\ndoor opened on its own the beans were even let out of the craft like school children in this\ninstance and almost any other where live biologics were recovered the witness remarks the beans live\nat most a few days before they keel over dead these points alongside the fact that beans could\nbreathe earth's atmosphere are used by the witness to support the hypothesis they are like drones or\nbiological computers like gary nolan said whatever's making these things just creates a biological\ncrew when it needs one and they do their job and nothing else at least that was our theory because\ntheir bodies didn't seem built to last and the eggheads found it suspicious that they were able\nto breathe our atmosphere so easily of course we do not have access to any living or deceased\nnhi biologics in the public sector so are there at least any parallels we can draw from the witness\nthe subject of biologics and their taxonomy is one of the most contentious subjects in uap the\nvisual of the classic gray alien small beans varying in color with elongated limbs frail bodies\nenlarged head large to enormous eyes tiny to non-existent noses and mouths have been echoed\nsince the dawn of uap lore from roswell to kingman to abductee claims to myriad files in the lennard\nstring field files similar descriptions of non-human biologics pop up everywhere and this\nisn't mentioning countless accusations of the program being in possession of living and dead\nbeans unfortunately this is also one of the most lied about and hoaxed aspects of the phenomenon\nso for now we must stick to the direct confirmation of biological retrieval confirmed by grush sometimes\nyou encounter um dead pilots and relate statements of quote little gray men whose ships had crashed\nor had been shot down being kept on ice by the air force technology division at right paterson\nair force base end quote as stated by former special assistant to the deputy director of the cia\nvictor marchetti our witness goes back to pondering why it is saucers and maybe one or two other\ntypes actually have a manned crew i'm guessing maybe one of these is the triangular shape the\nwitness in the program had a theory quote this was all being fabricated for us and even tasked\nnasa to look for where something like a big 3d printer could be in the solar system some facility\nor computer just making these crafts and these things and sending them to earth and sometimes\nthey crashed or they just landed and didn't take off like whatever was doing this wanted us to\nrecover the craft i don't know if they ever found anything though there was some excitement for a\nwhile it's hard to hide heat in space and obviously making these crafts on such a large scale\nwould give off a lot of heat or maybe not maybe they use physics we don't even understand these\nare some very charged statements with a lot to unpack we do know around the time of our witnesses\ninvolvement in the program nasa openly denied studying ufo's however we can find a letter to\nnasa chief of ground operations safety dated december 13th 1977 this page observed only via\nfoyer request is directed towards the nasa administrator about ufo's detailing quote what\ncould be a piece of a ufo end quote was examined at los alamos for a period of over two months\nadditionally on page 121 and 126 of this black vault pdf detailing nasa foyer requests we can see\ninternal memo admit the agency conducted a ufo hard evidence analysis program titled ufo heap\naround the late 70s and this 3d printer has actually a very real basis in 20th century physics the\nidea of a universal constructor or self-replicating automata was first proposed in the 1940s by\nphysicist john von neumann who by the way was listed as being involved in ufo recovery along\nwith vanavar bush and robert oppenheimer by physicist robert sarbacher i talked about earlier\nhis theory explores how a sub faster than light civilization can colonize a galaxy the automata\ninvolve robotic or nano robotic systems that replicate by creating miniature copies of themselves\nwhich grow over time such a feat would require an abundance of material so maybe this heat signature\nthe witness mentioned occurred near our asteroid belt but the replicator hub nestled within the\ndark regions of a solar system for creating craft and i guess biologics is an extremely plausible\nscenario this even rings identically to the alleged four-chan whistleblower who stated a ufo\nreplicator lies within our oceans and these statements by our witness quote whatever was\ndoing this wanted us to recover the craft and quote is widely known within ufology as donation\ncraft this subject has been touched on by david grush call it spacecraft if you will non-human\nexotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed is the subject of eric taber's\naero testimony as this egg-shaped craft was simply found untouched in the desert and features\nin many corners of ufology the witness makes multiple mentions to failed in 1990s successful\nattempts to down uap craft one failure occurred in iran and i am almost positive this is the 1976\niran major jeffari case the successful downing of uap craft is something i have covered often\nincluding in my last video where witness tb states the usg developed technology within the star wars\nprogram to down craft people have been hurt by these craft according to the witness but theorizes\nthis is incidental and a byproduct of the craft themselves manned or unmanned the craft have\nthe ability to distort perception and mess with minds quote unquote anchors were formed for recovery\noperatives to keep them grounded in reality for instance if you and i were on a security team\nand approached a craft would say okay the craft is resting up against a big oak tree and there's\na gray boulder on the other side you think of that picture and it would help with the confusion\nwhenever that effect happened kind of warded off this messing with human cognition has been\nmentioned extensively by dr gary nolan and even mentioned an atyp slide nine leaked from christ\nfor melons personal website and lastly what do they want the witness doesn't know the program\nstrongly supports the donation theory where the craft are gifted maybe the technology is gifted\nto not cause massive disruption within our own evolution we had another conclusion though this\none more disturbing maybe they just left these crafts lying around because they were easy to build\nhey guys thank you so much for watching as i broke down the infographics whistleblower who\nclaimed to have first-hand experience in the crash retrieval program my objective of this video\nwas to analyze some of these claims relate them to ufology at large as well as try to investigate\nas much as we could about this whistleblower to see if their testimony and the individual is fact\nor fiction so i think i feel pretty confident in us being able to kind of determine the time frame\nof this initial event in vietnam occurring october to december in 1968 in company e 52nd\ninfantry in the first calvary division l r r p close to saigon and south vietnam probably fourth\nlong and i'm pretty confident in five of the eight or nine names i may have messed that up who\nfollowing died in combat after the initial sighting of the uap from our whistleblower and i'm also\npretty confident in this introduction to the program october to december in 1969 and his years\nof service 1969 to 2004 i'm also medium confident on the three south america crashes and ireland\nuk crash that occurred in 1996 these are all uh not very known cases pretty kind of low key but\nyou know these kind of fit our timetable fit um fit our interest fit what we were looking for so\nguys i do have a theory on who this whistleblower might be i now this could very well be false\ni don't think it holds much water more so than dates and kind of interesting coincidences lining\nup because if i had to put money on it i do think this whistleblower is offering some uh true testimony\nhere i don't think this is as simple as just something fictitious is a very interesting\ntestimony and a lot of things that line up to you follow g yet large but the theory remember\njust a theory uh for those of you who watched my last video the witness tb do you remember the\ngeneral that he said showed classified uap derived cloaking technology in 2004 and was thus\ninvestigated demoted a star and retired this is general john m rigs guys i think it's possible\nthat this whistleblower is this aforementioned general general john m rigs why do i think that\nwell john m rigs enlisted in the u.s army in 1965 was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1969\nand he then went on to achieve 1100 hours of flight time earning himself a distinguished cross\nremember what he said in theater in vietnam a rapid reaction unit this would make sense that if he\nthen got his uh flying license in the military helicopter pilot he would have then served on\nthat rapid reaction unit possibly providing perimeter security and and flying the team there\nright so his time in the military was 1965 when he enlisted 1969 when he was commissioned an officer\nto 2004 john m rigs was forced to retire in 2004 2005 so this lines up exactly with our witnesses\ntenure in the program as well and our witness states eventually he moved over to the administrative\nside of the program right well john m rigs was promoted to general and higher up in the military\nworked with congress he was also stationed at a u.s army base in in um i'm trying to look in in\ngermany i'm not quite sure when this is but this would line up with our u uh u k based crash would\nit not kind of a as our witness says that europe is always ready in a constant state of war that\nyou know these objects are attracted to conflict there um again this theory doesn't hold much\nwater but we know that if this story about john m rigs is true which i do believe it is because\ni do with the credibility of of tb's claims mr rigs is also well aware of uap drive tech\nreverse engineering and crash retrieval efforts and let's not forget once he retired after allegedly\nshowing a bae systems employee classified technology he went on to then serve as an aviation\nand strategic defense consultant so not much besides dates and i don't want to kick off an\ninvestigation i can't control because there's still so much more to investigate with this but\nthat is my little theory right now um if you guys have watched this and you have another theory\nlet me know what it is because i'm i'm investigating i really want to get to the bottom of this because\nthis is such an interesting story and as we can see that a 25 minute video takes over 40 minutes\nto kind of analyze and not just watching the video right like you guys know i'm not just a\nscreen cap in the video plan me pausing every couple of minutes and giving my thoughts no we're\nlinking documents we're linking cases we're linking relevant video footage and clips so\nyeah that shows you how much meat is on the bone of this specific case i think it's enthralling\nand i really have tried to get in contact with the infographics team everything short of paying\nto to become a member of theirs to join their discord which i i just might at this point\nbecause i really want to find this out but i hope you guys have just as great of a time\nkind of sifting through this video as i did in and joining me on this venture as we try to learn\nmore about this whistleblower and determine if this is a real individual and real experience\ni know i find the um the biologics the androids one of the most interesting things ever since\ngrush came out last summer of 2023 and talked about biologics that statement as he testified to\ncongress biologics dead pilots as he said to ross colthart has enthralled me and and hearing gary\nnolan talk about the hypothesis of biological androids that's just something i found so interesting\nif any of you guys listen to the podcast mysterious universe i think this was back in 2017 i can't\nremember exactly when they did a show on this exact subject kind of like the classic grays being a\nbiological android so for the better part of a decade now i've been thinking about this theory\nit's just been so interesting to my head so you know watching this whistleblower say that these\nbiologics are like children respond to basic stimuli keel over and dead and die when their purpose\nis done it's just so fascinating to me so in the comments guys let me know what you think please\nremember to like and subscribe always remember i got a patreon if you think the channel's worth\nanything i don't gatekeep any content uh just support what you think the channel's worth and uh\nplease let me know what you think i'd love to get some more discussion around this video and i\nwill catch everybody on the next show thank you\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"videopages/US%20Special%20Forces%20Confession%20-%20I%20Recovered%20Crashed%20UFOs%20-%20Fact%20or%20Fiction%EF%BC%9F/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<ul>

Williams, who alongside with his nine-man\ncrew in their Navy Fleet Logistics Air Wing plane, observed a trans-medium UFO depart\nthe ocean and traverse the skies between Kefalvik, Iceland, and Newfoundland.\nThe object, initially mistaken for a ship, rose from beneath the clouds and approached\nthe Navy aircraft at a, quote, terrifying closing rate.\nThe object hovered near the air wing's port site before disappearing at alarming speeds.\nThe object was described as elliptical or cigar-shaped, measuring a minimum of 200 feet\nwith a red-orange glow along the periphery.\nThe other two surviving cases do not fit our investigation today, but still check this out.\nCase 27 highlights the experience of a South African Airways constellation craft en route\nfrom London to Johannesburg.\nNear the Kenya border, the airplane crossed over the crater of a long-extinct volcano where\nthe pilots noticed a silvery disk stationed deep within the crater.\nThe disk took off at a high rate of speed straight up and out of sight of the craft.\nNext we can look at the 24th of April, 1952, where the Air Force Technical Intelligence\nCenter is written by AFOIN-XSG, regarding the possible connection of submarine contacts.\nThis letter addressed to one Colonel Dunn attaches nine reports of submarine contacts\nwith UFOs, specifically flying disks, with the assistance of ONI, the Office of Naval\nIntelligence.\nUnfortunately, these reports are unavailable, but what is interesting are the Navy UFO sightings\nlisted in the 1950s.\nThis information is relayed in Timothy Goode's book, Need to Know, UFOs, the Military and\nIntelligence.\nThis information is supplied by respected ufologist Leonard Stringfield, who I covered\nin the Kingman Air of Zona Crash.\nStringfield was informed of thousands of ONI UAP reports from 1952 to 1956.\nBut I skipped over this mysterious sender of the nine reports, AFOIN-XSG.\nAFOIN is the Air Force Office of Intelligence, and we can assume that this SG is a special\ngroup.\nCuriously, we can look back to Edward J. Ruppel, a man I have talked about extensively, who\nserved as director of Project Grudge and Blue Book.\nRuppel stated that AFOIN was conducting a more complete investigation of UFOs parallel\nto Blue Book in the later uncovered Battelle's Project Stork.\nRuppel stated AFOIN's technical capabilities branch and collection control branch were specific\noffices doing UFO related work.\nWas this Air Force special group tasked with investigating the nine USO reports one of\nthe US government's real secret UFO investigation groups?\nTo me, it appears likely.\nIn 1979, Kufan, the computer UFO network, filed FOIA requests for information on the\nmysterious special group.\nAll requests were denied under executive order, citing the national security need to maintain\nclassification.\nThe trail here in the 1950s goes much deeper as well.\nIn 1954, JANAP, the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication, published Directive 146C, where\nboth Airborne and Waterborne UFO were to be reported under service, communication instructions\nfor reporting vital intelligence sightings, and Merrant.\nI'm guessing this means maritime intelligence.\nThis meant both civilians and pilots were prohibited from discussing officially reported\nsightings.\nAs service and Merrant sightings were subject to the Communications Act of 1934 and espionage\nlaws, violators would receive a prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.\nAnd if you've watched a single one of my videos, you probably know I talk often about\nUSAF Regulation 200-2.\nSo I expect everybody knows that by heart, but if you don't, this regulation restricted\nall official UFO reporting to be sent to ATIC and not Blue Book.\nWell, in that same year, 1954, January 23rd, to be precise, the US Navy issued OPNAV, the\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, Directive 3820, which required UAP sightings referenced\nas flying object reports, to be sent to the Director of ATIC, the Director of USAF Intelligence,\nand the Director of Naval Intelligence.\nThis report, which we can find a copy of in Donald Keyho's book, The Flying Saucer\nConspiracy, directly cites JANAP-146C.\nWith the implementation of 1953's USAF Regulation 200-2, OPNAV Directive 3820, and JANAP-146C,\nwe enter the slow descent into the dark ages of UFO reporting, starting with explanations\nof swamp gas and weather balloons.\nSo our paper trail here becomes relatively sparse, and we have to start to rely on claims\nof USO studies and experiences.\nWe must travel all the way to 1985, where ufologist Jacques Vall\u00e9e claims in Forbidden\nScience Pacific Heights, a collection of his personal journals, that a source at NARCAP,\nthe National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, told him that a large\ncollection of UFO and USO files were being stored at Norton Air Force Base.\nNorton has historically been associated with UAP or NHI research, such as being named by\nStephen Greer and the disclosure project in his alleged briefing to Congress in 1996.\nBut let's move on to a really curious rabbit hole from 2017.\nOf course, with an absence of official documentation, this story should be taken with some skepticism.\nBut let's tackle the claims by astronomer Mark Dantonio.\nWith Dantonio, president of FX Models, a company with naval contracts was taken for a ride\nin a naval submarine as a thank you for his company's contract work.\nWhile undersea, the sonar team picked up what they called a fast mover, traveling at several\nhundred knots.\nFor reference, most submarines and torpedoes travel at roughly 40 knots.\nThe commanding officer told the sonar operator to, quote, log it and dog it, end quote, essentially\nbury in the encounter.\nAnd years later, Mark asked a senior naval figure about the fast mover program.\nI bet you can all guess the response.\nSorry, Mark, I can't talk about that program.\nThese two Dantonio essentially confirmed the program's existence, especially since the\nfigure told Mark that USOs were common and that there was a program in place to classify\nand log and determine the speed of them, but those reports go into a vault.\nOf course, remember, this is all just alleged testimony, we have no way to prove this right\nnow.\nBut the year of 2022 is where chatter around USO became much louder and really made its\nway into the public zeitgeist.\nI'd like to take a look at the published notes of Oak Shannon, a figure I haven't mentioned\nsince the Wilson Davis memo video.\nShannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Department\nof Energy Nuclear Physicists, confirmed the authenticity of the Wilson Davis memo, but\nthat's not our focus for today.\nThese notes, published in 2022, recall Oak's time at the Advanced Theoretical Working Group,\nheld at BDM's International's McLean Secure Facility, and classified using DOE controls\nin 1985.\nThese notes contain some fascinating information and I highly recommend reading them.\nYou already know, just check the show notes.\nBut alongside mention of some UFO hotspots such as Mount Hayes, Alaska, Shannon jots\ndown the Navy has intelligence on an underwater UFO hotspot near Gulfo San Matisse off the\ncoast of Argentina.\nAnd we can also look at ex-CIA operative John Ramirez, the man who made the Galactic Federations\nclaims famous, who in 2022 claimed he had heard rumors of a relationship between the\nOffice of Naval Research and the CIA Office of Scientific and Weapons Research slash WINPAC,\nthe Weapons Intelligence Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center, where USO materials\nare recovered and transferred to the CIA.\nInteresting connections here, seen as there are some insane CIA UAP rabbit holes, but I\nwant to save this for a more focused video on the topic.\nAnd now we get to absolutely the most credible figure to speak on USO, who featured on Sol's\nNovember 2023 panel, Timothy Galladette, retired US Navy Rear Admiral, former assistant secretary\nof commerce for oceans and atmosphere within the US Department of Commerce, and former\nadministrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nHere I am an ocean scientist for three and a half decades, and I sit in a lot of meetings\nwith leading ocean scientists still today, but it just it kind of mystifies me that more\npeople are intellectually curious about what the story of the century is, and that's these,\nthese that are occurring in the water.\nOn a fascinating news nation interview with Ross Coltart, Galladette has made some profound\nstatements such as,\nWe're being visited by non-human intelligence with technology we really don't understand,\nand with intentions we don't understand it all either.\nNow that really has surprised me to hear that from a former very high ranking flag officer\nin the US Navy to actually say you're stating categorically that you believe NHI, non-human\nintelligence, are real.\nAbsolutely.\nI think it's about time that we do disclose that we, we are in contact with non-human intelligence.\nThere is so much of interest I want to cover on the Rear Admiral, such as his Sol Foundation\ndiscussion surrounding viewing the gimbal and go fast videos, but having them mysteriously\nremoved from his inbox.\nOr how in his recent tweet, Galladette comments on the Sol Cal anomaly, possibly USO related\nbeing scrubbed from Google Earth.\nBut let's focus now on his 2024 Sol published white paper, Beneath the Surface.\nWe may learn more about UAP by looking in the ocean.\nThis excellent paper was written by Galladette, and besides highlighting the obvious threat\nto maritime security, the paper frames the importance of USO's study as an unprecedented\nopportunity for maritime science and the subject should be elevated to national research priorities.\nGalladette calls for action to uncover the unknown unknowns associated with UAP and USO's\ndue to the concerning non-reaction of the DOD regarding unidentified objects with unexplainable\ncharacteristics entering US water space.\nIn the executive summary of the piece, the Rear Admiral makes a beautiful statement quote.\nYet, however concerning the security implications of UAP are, the scientific ramifications are\nnothing short of world changing, pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation\nhave recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air sea interface in ways\nnot possible for anything made by humans.\nAnd several pieces of congressional legislation support these observations by defining UAP\nas trans-medium vehicles.\nThe stunning implication is that engineering, material science, and physics beyond the state\nof the art are needed to produce and operate these objects.\nThis knowledge could transform such fields as air and maritime transportation, energy\ngeneration, agriculture, communication, computing, manufacturing, space travel, virtually every\nimaginable economic sector, not to mention defense.\nAnother study of UAP may lead to discoveries that make those of the scientific revolution\nin the 17th and 18th centuries look like baby steps.\nThroughout this paper, Gallaudet draws attention to the massive disparity between investigating\nUAP operating in our skies and UAP operating within our oceans.\nThis is especially highlighted in the abysmal Aero Historical Report Volume 1, which makes\na grand total of zero references to any cases or whistleblowers having to do with USO or\nmaritime situations.\nAs I mentioned in the opening statement of this video, and this is really cool to see,\nGallaudet mentioned the Tic Tac case as observed in 2004 by the Navy FA-18F Super Hornets where\nthe pilots observed the UAP hovering just above roiling ocean whitewater, possibly indicating\na larger UAP below the surface.\nOther cases highlighted in this paper include the Trans-Medium UAP, filmed in 2013 in Aguadilla,\nPuerto Rico, captured by US Customs and Border Protection Thermal Imaging Systems.\nQuote, over three minutes the object appeared to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 mph.\nEnter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum\nunderwater velocity of 95 mph, and at one point split into two parts before entering\nthe water again.\nThe SCU authorities concluded that no known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile, or human\nmade technology possesses these characteristics or capabilities.\nGallaudet also draws from a body of literature to state that USO and Trans-Medium UAP are\njust as diverse as those spotted traversing the skies, quote, luminous orbs, silver and\ngray discs, and triangular and cigar shaped objects with various lighting conditions.\nFirst lighted craft are often seen under the sea surface without ever emerging, end quote.\nThe paper also touches on a fascinating case I have never heard of that occurred off the\ncoast of Shelburne Harbor, Nova Scotia in 1960, and no this isn't Shag Harbor in 1967,\nhowever the two are located extremely close.\nThis case covers the encounters of several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated\nin a US Canadian joint minesweeping exercise where the divers claimed to have observed\ntwo disc shaped craft on the seabed.\nNot only did the divers say they observed occupants attempting to repair one of the craft, but\nalso recorded footage of the event.\nWisely, Gallaudet thought this story pretty nonsensical or unbelievable until recent US\nmilitary whistleblower revelations.\nI really recommend reading this whole paper, just check the show notes.\nThe Rear Admiral wrote an excellent piece that deserves attention.\nAfter covering the sole paper, I would like to discuss just a handful of fascinating military\nUSO cases that have caught my eye throughout history.\nIn the same year of 2022, Lou Elizondo discussed a fascinating military USO encounter while\nbeing interviewed by astronaut Terry Virts.\nCheck this out.\nI'll tell you, some of this stuff was absolutely riveting.\nLet's talk about the stuff, I'll share with you one interesting event that occurred.\nIt's pretty incredible.\nYou have, I'm not going to go into too much detail, I want people to know who it is.\nThe person is kind of very cagey about this, but you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean\nisland on a regular basis because the Navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile\ntechnology and whatnot.\nWhat will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it falls into the\nsplashes into the ocean, it will sink and then at a certain time it rises up and we\ngo and fetch it.\nWe analyze it for telemetry and things like that.\nLong story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things as they are\nrecovering it the first time, the missile, they're pulling up and something, what was\ndescribed round and circular about the size of a small island, black, dark color starts\nrising to the surface.\nIt doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface.\nThey thought, wow, that's really, really peculiar.\nWell, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this, another missile that\nwas test fired.\nThis time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile\nand this thing starts coming out of the water again and if you know about the Puerto Rican\ntrench out there, you've talked about water that's 22,000 feet deep.\nIt's the second deepest part of the ocean.\nThe thing starts rising up and it's starting to come to the surface.\nThe frogman is literally trying to climb the rope.\nThey're doing an emergency ascent.\nIt's absolutely panic at the disco, freaking out, what the hell is that, what's going on\nand as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile under water and then disappears, never\nto be seen again.\nAnd David Fraver's Tic Tac Encounter isn't the only time the US Navy and military has\nencountered these.\nIn 2010, USN Petty Officer John Bowman saw a Tic Tac shaped object from the flight deck\nof the USS Carl Vinson off the coast of Haiti, quote, I was staring into the water from above\nwhen a large fat white Tic Tac object, approximately 20 feet in length, suddenly appeared in my\nview below me, moving right and darted into the depths as fast as it appeared.\nI couldn't really comprehend what I saw.\nIt was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, it's forward and rapidly collapsed\nin on itself and disappeared and quote, Bowman reported this sighting to his supervising\nofficer but was not debriefed and not to file a report.\nThe officer told him that everybody sees weird things in the ocean.\nEverybody knows the famous Tic Tac sighting seen from the USS Nimitz in 2004, but did\nyou know in 1991, the same vessel had a USO encounter?\nPetty Officer Kevin Thomas claimed to have seen a quote, huge black triangle, end quote,\nnear one kilometer in length, lift out of the ocean and shoot vertically into the sky\nwhen he was left on deck after the ship was ordered to darken and clear decks.\nThomas claimed to have witnessed no water dripping off the craft, nor sound made by\nthe craft.\nThe next day, men in civilian clothes appeared and interviewed Thomas on board the Nimitz\nasking why he was outside and what he saw.\nThomas said not a peep due to fear of being disciplined.\nThis story needs to be approached with some skepticism because full transparency at the\nmoment, I am unable to uncover Thomas' service record.\nAnd here I just wanted to cover a handful of these USO cases.\nIf for my next video, you guys would like to see me tackle solely a list of USO cases\nofficially reported throughout Blue Book and other channels, let me know.\nI personally really want to make that video so if the interest is there, I will absolutely\ntackle it.\nAnd lastly guys, I just wanted to cover a series of very controversial images taken\nin March of 1971 from the USS Trepang.\nThese images purport to show the vessels encounter with at least two forms of UAP slash USOs,\na triangle and cigar shaped craft.\nDebate has circled endlessly since these photos first appeared, some arguing they are legitimate,\nsome arguing their hoaxes, and some arguing the images are real but depict engagement\nwith test barrage balloons.\nAnd I do have to add there are some people who think all or some of these photos are\nan example of Feta Morgana, a complex mirage appearing above the horizon.\nThe story goes these images first appeared in a French magazine called Top Secret.\nThe original scans of the images were sent to investigator Alex Mistretta.\nAllegedly, the Trepang station between Iceland and Jan Mayen Island in March of 1971, led\nby Admiral Dean Reynolds Sackett, happened upon the USOs by accident.\nOfficer John Clica initially spotted the objects with the onboard periscope.\nSome of these images seem to be harmless snapshots of the objects hovering, entering, or leaving\nthe water, while others appear to show the objects in distress, unknown if this was due\nto engagement with the Trepang.\nWell we can actually confirm that the USS Trepang was indeed in the Arctic at this time,\nespecially near Blue Nose Arctic Circle during November of 1971, and we can confirm this\nwas the only vessel in the region.\nI cannot find any information on if attack submarines carry balloons for training exercises,\nsolely this joint USN CIA document on testing balloon launches from submarines that was\nconducted in 1955, so this does cast doubt on the balloon training exercise theory for\nme, especially due to the fact there are no live fire records by the submarine at this\ntime.\nInvestigator and Navy pilot Steve Murillo was able to speak to Admiral Sackett.\nAdmiral Sackett was gracious enough to take multiple phone calls, but steered away from\nthe UFO question.\nThe Admiral stated he did not see anything unusual on board the Trepang, nor did anyone\nelse.\nHe only, quote, saw ice.\nThe alleged spotter from the periscope, John Clica, whose identity we can also confirm,\nwas also contacted.\nHe stated he found the investigation interesting, and did not know what the pictures represented.\nSo these two statements essentially kill the training range story for me.\nWe are left with likely a hoax or the real deal, but the Admiral and Clica either cannot\nbreak security oaths or were unaware of these signatures.\nUnfortunately, one of the best images of the lot shows signs of tampering, credit to Wim\nVan Utrecht for this discovery.\nTo my knowledge, this is the only such example of photo tampering.\nThough he is extremely skeptical on these images, I tend to agree with the thesis of\nJohn Greenwald here, that this altered image does not discredit the validity of the other\nimages.\nJohn states many publications will enhance photographs for print.\nThis is done to improve visual appeal, and since the original images does indeed differ\nsomewhat in aspect from the magazine image, I find this hypothesis to be pretty plausible.\nSo are these images of the triangle, cigar, and possibly an egg-shaped UAP interacting\nwith our oceans real or a hoax?\nPersonally, I'm undecided, I need to do more investigation into this case, but the\nimages are perplexing to say the least.\nHey guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the history\nand fascinating aspects of USO.\nIn my opinion, throughout history USO have been severely overlooked until 2022 and onward.\nThank you Timothy Gallaudet, one of the biggest inspirations for this video.\nI find that I've never ever ever anywhere seen the history of USO study covered.\nNow here at my channel, and probably many other channels too, we go in depth into Project\nBlue Book, The Robertson Panel, The Condon Report, all of these aspects throughout history\nof UFO being studied openly or secretly, but you never hear about USOs.\nSo I just really wanted to touch on this fascinating aspect of the phenomenon.\nAnd if you guys want, I really want to make that kind of video on some famous and underrepresented\nUSO cases.\nI want to pull directly from Blue Book and Grudge and Sine and look from there, find some\ncredible reports.\nThat's a video that really excites me.\nSo if you guys want to see that, let me know in the comments below.\nPlease remember to like and subscribe and if you think about it, join the Patreon, I'm\nnot going to gatekeep any of my content, only pay for what you think the content is worth.\nAnd for those of you who are into the sport, how about that 300 card guys?\nThat Holloway Gachie finish was one of the most wild things I've ever seen.\nI'm happy my boy Yuri Prohaska got the win.\nAnd choosing Jamal Hill aged like a gross cheese.\nSo that didn't end up too well.\nHope him the best.\nHe's a great fighter.\nBut let me know what you guys think about this next video and some other video ideas\nyou guys want to see.\nI'm recording this the day after the Kona Blue files came out.\nSo I will definitely be taking a look at those and reporting back to you guys.\nSo thank you so much and I'll catch everybody next time.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"videopages/USO%20-%20Unidentified%20Submerged%20Objects/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<ul> <li>TXT</li> <li>SRT</li> <li>VTT</li> <li>TSV</li>

<pre><code>The United States most well-known UFO investigation panels, Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book,\nran from 1949 to 1969 and collected data on more than 13,000 UFO sightings.\nOf this massive body of sightings, 258 cases reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small\npercentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or transmedium objects.\nOf course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out, 1952's OpNav Directive\n3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence\nCenter, USAF Intelligence, and Director of Naval Intelligence.\nSo it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO.\nBut what about the cases we do have?\nAnd what other cases that don't appear in Blue Book that span our history are worth\nour time?\nHey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout\nhistory.\nFrom Blue Book to the modern day to pre-World War I, let's analyze reported cases of unidentified\nsubmerged objects.\nAnd guys, today we will not just be sticking with the US, but analyzing global cases I\nfind worth studying.\nAs mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Blue Book cases, aka 258 reports, involved sea\nsightings of UFOs.\nAnd 13 of these reports can be classified as good, meeting merit standards for UFO reporting,\nand a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and transmedium objects.\nFound in the annals of Blue Book indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic\nfrom the ship Marcala on August 4, 1950.\nShockingly, this case is listed by Blue Book as unidentified, and may in fact be my favorite\ncase I will discuss today.\nAt 10pm EDT, the shipmaster, chief mate, and third mate of the MV Marcala saw an unidentified\nelliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest heading northeast.\nPassing within 1,000 feet of the ship, the object hovered no more than 100 feet above\nsea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph.\nThis object was described as ovular, cylindrically shaped and elliptical, like half an egg cut\nlengthwise.\nThe object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white.\nAll three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it\npassed closely over the ocean.\nThis event lasted roughly a minute.\nWe can also hop on board the SS city of Almaco, heading from Yokohama to LA just north of\nthe Hawaiian Islands on November 7, 1959.\nThree witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water\nfrom four miles north of the ship.\nThe light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface, and remember those three\nflashes as they'll come up later.\nThe Almaco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered.\nBlue Book labeled this case as a meteor, but while such a prosaic explanation might be\npossible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water\nfor an extended time period warrants more investigation.\nAnd if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate near the vicinity\nof Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June 1960.\nAt 2334 local time, an Operation Range Vessel, co-named Whiskey, was retrieving the data cassette\nfrom a missile test labeled 1802.\nThe small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette, illuminated by strobes\nand monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above.\nAs the smaller boat got within three to five hundred yards of the strobe, the crew observed\na steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface\nand roughly 25 degrees from their boat.\nThis light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break\nover the light.\nThe event lasted for 10 seconds and was spotted by the RCA photographer, test observer, divers\nof the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and co-pilot of the recovery plane.\nBlue Book claimed this sighting was a flare, however.\nIt was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site.\nAnd this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo\nin my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data observed a massive\nUSO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile.\nAnd speaking of rushed Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on\nthe 11th of January 1966.\nNear 1,000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate Helmsman and bow lookout observed a cigar\nshaped object approach their ship.\nThe cigar object glowed with an orange-yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and\na body with a duller glow.\nThe body had two lights on top and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet\nlong and 35 to 40 feet in length.\nThe object neared the starboard side of the ship from the horizon and then turned 180 degrees\nto avoid going over the vessel.\nIt approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400 feet.\nAfter hovering for 30 seconds, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again\nchanged directions.\nThis incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea.\nThe shipmaster believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search.\nBlue Book identified this case as the Cosmos 33 satellite decay, however, this explanation\ndoes not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes.\nIf you would like to read more on ship-based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF\non Maritime UFO and USO research in Blue Book.\nThis stat-rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Blue Book sightings\nbetween the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\nOf the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific.\nThis data highlights while there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot,\nUFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water.\nHistorically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports.\nIn fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive if not more than our own here in the United\nStates.\nOne day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not\nthe topic of our video today because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO\nreports that are indeed worth investigating.\nI will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO Secrets by Paul Stonehill\nand Philip Mantle, however, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy\nof note and can track down additional reporting on.\nMany of these cases are just stories and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified\nfiles like we do with Blue Book, so I will be doing my best to vet these cases.\nLet's dive into a handful of the most interesting.\nOn October 7, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents\nSea.\nIts radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles.\nThe Volga's Captain Tarantyn approached the bridge to see nine bright disks moving in\nfrom the northeast.\nThe disks arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes.\nDuring the encounter, ship comlinks malfunctioned, similar to the major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran\nUFO incident.\nAfter the disks depart, the ship comms and operations return to normal.\nRaising concern in the Soviet Navy, fleet admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov, known\nas the Likr, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic\nscientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to JANAP-146C and OpNAP Directive 3820.\nThe directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. Asaza and signed\nby Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr Novoitsev.\nThis case was not only discussed in Russia's USO Secrets, but also in Jacques Valais'\nbook UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union, a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30.\nThe link to the book, free of course, will be in the video description, so check that\nout for yourself.\nKamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia.\nThe almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Akhatsk from the Pacific Ocean.\nAccording to Russia's USO Secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin\nSolomchakov, on a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting\nresearch within a motorboat on Kamchatka Lake.\nSuddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of\nthe lake, in which rose a grey-colored oval object, estimated to be 40 to 60 meters in\nlength.\nThe object rose to an altitude of nearly 100 meters and hovered motionlessly.\nAs it did, the motorboat engine stalled, horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated\naway rapidly, restoring functions to their engine.\nWhat fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we\nsee Kevin Knuth discuss at the Sol Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from\nvehicles.\nIn the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I\nhave heard.\nThis information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Ziggle, one of Russia's\nmost well-respected ufologists.\nOn June 15, 77, the Soviet ship Novolkuznetsk navigated the Gulf of Gayaquil, Ecuador,\na radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent\nsphere rose from the water.\nIt flew around the ship, hovered 20 meters over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged, and\ndove back into the water.\nAnd with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nI'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on USOs from 2006,\nwhere we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon.\nI highly recommend checking out this whole documentary, and of course the link will be\nin the description.\nBut one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO slash USO government documentation is\nAustralia.\nThe Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers, and files on anomalous\nsightings.\nIn fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported, UAS Unusual\nAerial Sighting, occurred on January 23rd, 1964, and describes, quote, seen at sea by\ncrew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia.\nLarge lights and water made compass go haywire, shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise,\ncausing lights to pulsate, end quote.\nThe tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO-USO encounters\nand certainly not missed by Australia.\nA report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting.\nAround this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings\nseriously.\nSee these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included\nalongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman\nobserving a light shoot up from the water, hover, and disappear.\nAustralian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters very\nsimilar to both the fisherman encounter and our 1977 Soviet encounter.\nThis 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and\nlocal Aussies observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height, curve\nand return to the oceans.\nMany of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes once returned to sea.\nWe're back to our SS City of Almaco case in Project Blue Book.\nIt is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized\nthese could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams, however this\ndoes not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and\nAmericans.\nOutside of the Australian government, the citizens of the land down under have some fascinating\nstories of USOs.\nshooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers.\nIn 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederick Walter and Emma Flavel observed five gray oblong\nobjects, rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast.\nThis sighting was also observed by two railroad workers who described five white or light\npink egg shaped objects, rise from the sea but with the added detail of quivering, similar\nto our MV Marcolla case mentioned earlier in the video.\nCigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history.\nAround the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a\ncase that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review, 1966-67.\nPrivate pilot C. Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing four or five\nmysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island.\nApproaching the objects from the sky, there appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow\nand up to 100 feet long accompanied by three smaller objects.\nThe two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the\naircraft approached within two miles.\nInitially thought to be whales or submarines, the men in independent sightings from nearby\nSeabrae Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost\nlike they did not interact with the water.\nThis interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the HMNZS Southland case Knuth describes\nat the Seoul Foundation, which oddly enough occurred near New Zealand.\nWe all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he\nand his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle\nof the ocean in the middle of the night.\nBut I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case.\nWhat I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th\ncentury that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau.\nOn November 12, 1887, Captain R.F. Moore of the English steamer the SS Siberian encountered\na USO 10 nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland.\nThe captain observed an enormous fireball.\nRise from the sea to 50 feet, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky.\nAt the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and\nmost difficult to explain electrical phenomena.\nBut as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea.\nIn Africa, the Gulf of Guinea 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed\nan immense object sinking into the ocean.\nThe cigar shaped object measured nearly 200 meters long and 300 meters wide.\nAs the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights\nlit at the front and two blue-green lights shining at the other end.\nThis case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine.\nHowever, seen as popular submarines at this time such as the early German U-boat measured\nsolely 41 meters long, I still find this case anomalous.\nAnd now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel.\nThroughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon\nobserved by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere.\nAnd it's worthy to note, this just wasn't an isolated incident.\nIn fact, the Maritime Light Wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned\nearlier.\nWe had information that in the ocean, in the seas, in our inner seas,\nthere were cases of some kind of strange phenomena related to the light of water.\nOctober of 1969, the Arabian Sea.\nThe command of the Soviet scientific vessel Vladimir Vorobyev unexpectedly woke up\nwithout any sign of fear.\nThe instruments showed that the massive object was at a depth of 20 meters.\nIt was still one and a half hundred meters long.\nThey ran to the deck.\nNo, this is not a submarine, as we thought at first.\nIn the depths of the sea, against the clock arrow, slightly bent,\nthere were eight bright rays of the length of 200 meters.\nThe fiery continued for more than half an hour.\nThen the spot fell apart into several parts and disappeared.\nTwo years before that, the source of light was able to be seen.\nIt was in 1967, in the Samzalivi.\nThe sailors of several Dutch ships then observed the rotation of huge\nglowing wheels on the water.\nAnd from the Glenfolle hot spring, it was clearly seen that the object\nthat was shining on the water was 20-30 meters in diameter.\nWhat was it?\nThe question remained unanswered.\nIn the sea, many times, there were glowing wheels\nthat our famous construction engineer, Krylov, called\nunderwater ghosts.\nThe size of the wheels is sometimes huge, up to several kilometers.\nAnd many times, they can be seen even from space.\nThey are rarely moved, and quite quickly.\nThe brightness of the glow on the surface of the sea is such that\nthe glare is sometimes visible on the clouds.\nWhat is it? Without the glow of microorganisms?\nBut how to explain the amazing symmetry\nand the huge speed of rotation of the light wheels?\nSometimes the clouds slip on the surface of the sea\nwith the speed of a racing car.\nMicroorganisms cannot move so quickly.\nMoreover, the test of water from the wheels often shows\nthat there are no even traces of the glowing plankton.\nThe light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by\nspokes of brilliant white light.\nThat can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air,\nserving as a possibly trans-medium craft.\nI must note, also as they talked about in the video,\nsome attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction\nbetween bioluminescent algae and pressure waves\nin an otherwise calm water. However,\nI do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus\non the existence. But let's review the earliest sightings\nof these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many,\nmany more sightings of the maritime light wheel\nthat have been observed, but I just want to recount a few of the earliest.\nOn March 27th, 1873,\nthe ship Adelheid voyage from Leban to Singapore.\nCaptain Ledman noticed a peculiar, blinding,\nmilky white light. Appear beneath the waves\nabout two ship lengths from the vessel.\nFlakes of light described as, quote, flakes of snow\nwhen driven over the rocks by a strong wind, end quote.\nThe light followed the ship traveling at four to five knots\nfor roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing.\nLedman stated he had not seen anything like this\nin his 26 years of maritime life.\nWe can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia,\nmentioned in an 1873 news article in the Argus.\nAn almost USO flap\nwas experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901.\nAn initial USO sighting\nwas reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans,\na hydrographer for the British Navy on May 15th, 1879.\nJ. E. Pringle of the HMS Vulture\nreported, quote, luminous waves\nor pulsations in the water,\nmoving at great speed, end quote, passing under the vulture.\nIt was at this time Pringle noticed two objects\nin the east and west, what appeared to be, quote,\nrevolving wheels with a center on that bearing\nand whose spokes were illuminated, end quote.\nWorthy to note, these two wheels were rotating\nin equal and opposite directions, and the spokes\nwere about 25 feet in length.\nIt is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water\nas the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here.\nThe second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880\nby British India Company steamer Patna.\nCaptain Avern, Mr. Manning Third Officer\nand others observed two enormous luminous wheels\nappear on each side of the ship near 11.30 p.m.\nThe wheels were, quote, whirling around,\nthe spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship.\nThe spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long\nand resemble the birch rods of the Dame School.\nEach wheel contained about 16 spokes,\nand the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter.\nThe spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around, end quote.\nThe men described the appearance of the spokes\ncould almost be represented by standing in a boat\nand flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally\nalong the surface of the water, round and round.\nThe final Persian encounter with this USO\nwas observed on April 4th, 1901,\nwhere Captain Hosean of the steamship Kila encountered, quote,\nVash shafts of light suddenly appeared.\nShaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea,\nbut it was only a faint light and in about 15 minutes died out,\nhaving appeared suddenly and having died out gradually.\nThese shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour.\nFrom earlier the year of 1880, I just mentioned,\nthis wheel-like object was possibly seen off the Malabar coast of India\non January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan.\nAri Harris describes a clear night over calm waters,\nstars shining bright and no moon present.\nAt roughly 10 p.m. Harris and the shift's third officer\nnoticed a milky white circle in the sky,\nresembling, quote, the nebulae sometimes seen in the heavens.\nApproaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel\nto try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object\nand its waves of light.\nThe last old example here I will cover\noccurred on the 10th of June, 1909\nand was actually featured in Scientific American,\nissue 106-51, which relays\nthe Nautical Meteorological Annual\npublished by the Danish Meteorological Institute,\na report on a quote, singular phenomena.\nWhile sailing through the Straits of Malacca,\nCaptain Gabe of the SS Bintang\nobserved a vast revolving wheel of light under the water,\nquote, long arms issuing from a center\naround which the whole system appeared to rotate, end quote.\nSurfacing, this wheel was so vast,\nthat half of it could be seen at a time\nwith the center laying near the horizon,\nthe wheel was able to move forward\nand vary in speed and rotation,\ndisappearing when the center was right under the vessel.\nAnd like our last 1880 case,\nthese maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water.\nIn the same Danish Meteorological Institute,\nthere reports another instance in 1910,\nwhere Captain Breyer of the Dutch steamship Valencien\nwas sailing in the South China Sea.\nHere, the captain, first and second mate\nand the first engineer all observed\nan object hovering above the water, quote,\nit looked like a horizontal wheel, rapidly turning.\nMy friends, thank you so much for watching today,\nas we took a deeper dive into USOs throughout history.\nPlease excuse the rash guard I'm wearing,\nI just got home from training, but phalanx if you're watching,\nI'm always open for a sponsor.\nBut anyways guys, I got such a great reaction\nfrom my first video on USO, I had to make a follow up\nand show that it doesn't matter what time period we're in,\nit doesn't matter what country we're in,\nthere are stories of unexplained things in the water.\nAs far as the maritime light wheel goes,\nI'm pretty torn on that whether that is a craft object\nor possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena.\nI'll include in the video description\na kind of not really debunk but a paper,\nkind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena,\nbut still, the fact that these are seen in the Persian Gulf,\nin Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me,\nbut even more fascinating to me are Australian,\nBlue Book, and Soviet Files.\nAll depicting very similar experiences,\ntic-tac-shaped craft, slash cigars,\nfireballs exiting the water,\nfireballs exiting the water that are almost curious about the ship,\negg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists,\nbut we see multiple cases of these sort of lightballs\nleaving the water dancing around\nand shooting off into the sky or back into the water.\nAs far as the tic-tacs go,\nwe often see these things hovering slightly above water\nand multiple cases saying they're quivering or gyrating\nor slowly submerging under the water\nbut not affecting the water surface\nsimilar to the case Kevin Knuth talks about.\nSo I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena\nby looking in our oceans.\nThere's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about,\nbut couldn't really find reputable sources for,\nsuch as some Chilean incidents\nthat supposedly in the military,\na fleet of saucers approached a craft.\nBut until then, we'll just keep digging in case files.\nIt's a shame that there's not a lot of information at Blue Book.\nWe can thank OPNAV3820 and JANAP146C for that,\nbut we'll work with what we're given.\nIf one day I can get in contact with George Knapp\nand see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia\npertain to USO, I would very much like to do that.\nBut where I stand now,\nUSO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon.\nThe fact that these craft can operate in air\nor under sea trans-medium objects\nwithout really changing their flight characteristics\nis insane to me.\nSo if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary,\nit's actually really darn good.\nI highly suggest watching it.\nIt does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USOs.\nAnd of course, you can listen to someone talk in a Russian accent\nfor 45 minutes, so that's great.\nAs always, guys, thank you so much for watching.\nI've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately,\nwith the Kingman video and getting retweeted by Ross.\nSo that's been great.\nI love all of you guys.\nThanks so much for being here.\nRemember to like and retweet.\nLeave a comment on the video.\nLet me know what you think.\nLet me know what cases, crashes, whatever you want me to tackle next.\nThat has to do with the phenomenon, of course.\nNothing random.\nSo just let me know.\nAnd again, thanks for being here, guys.\nI'll catch you on the next video.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"videopages/USO%20Case%20Book%EF%BC%9A%20Unidentified%20Submerged%20Objects%20Throughout%20History/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<ul> <li>TXT</li>
