<pre><code>The United States most well-known UFO investigation panels, Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book,\nran from 1949 to 1969 and collected data on more than 13,000 UFO sightings.\nOf this massive body of sightings, 258 cases reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small\npercentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or transmedium objects.\nOf course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out, 1952's OpNav Directive\n3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence\nCenter, USAF Intelligence, and Director of Naval Intelligence.\nSo it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO.\nBut what about the cases we do have?\nAnd what other cases that don't appear in Blue Book that span our history are worth\nour time?\nHey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout\nhistory.\nFrom Blue Book to the modern day to pre-World War I, let's analyze reported cases of unidentified\nsubmerged objects.\nAnd guys, today we will not just be sticking with the US, but analyzing global cases I\nfind worth studying.\nAs mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Blue Book cases, aka 258 reports, involved sea\nsightings of UFOs.\nAnd 13 of these reports can be classified as good, meeting merit standards for UFO reporting,\nand a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and transmedium objects.\nFound in the annals of Blue Book indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic\nfrom the ship Marcala on August 4, 1950.\nShockingly, this case is listed by Blue Book as unidentified, and may in fact be my favorite\ncase I will discuss today.\nAt 10pm EDT, the shipmaster, chief mate, and third mate of the MV Marcala saw an unidentified\nelliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest heading northeast.\nPassing within 1,000 feet of the ship, the object hovered no more than 100 feet above\nsea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph.\nThis object was described as ovular, cylindrically shaped and elliptical, like half an egg cut\nlengthwise.\nThe object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white.\nAll three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it\npassed closely over the ocean.\nThis event lasted roughly a minute.\nWe can also hop on board the SS city of Almaco, heading from Yokohama to LA just north of\nthe Hawaiian Islands on November 7, 1959.\nThree witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water\nfrom four miles north of the ship.\nThe light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface, and remember those three\nflashes as they'll come up later.\nThe Almaco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered.\nBlue Book labeled this case as a meteor, but while such a prosaic explanation might be\npossible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water\nfor an extended time period warrants more investigation.\nAnd if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate near the vicinity\nof Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June 1960.\nAt 2334 local time, an Operation Range Vessel, co-named Whiskey, was retrieving the data cassette\nfrom a missile test labeled 1802.\nThe small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette, illuminated by strobes\nand monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above.\nAs the smaller boat got within three to five hundred yards of the strobe, the crew observed\na steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface\nand roughly 25 degrees from their boat.\nThis light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break\nover the light.\nThe event lasted for 10 seconds and was spotted by the RCA photographer, test observer, divers\nof the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and co-pilot of the recovery plane.\nBlue Book claimed this sighting was a flare, however.\nIt was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site.\nAnd this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo\nin my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data observed a massive\nUSO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile.\nAnd speaking of rushed Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on\nthe 11th of January 1966.\nNear 1,000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate Helmsman and bow lookout observed a cigar\nshaped object approach their ship.\nThe cigar object glowed with an orange-yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and\na body with a duller glow.\nThe body had two lights on top and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet\nlong and 35 to 40 feet in length.\nThe object neared the starboard side of the ship from the horizon and then turned 180 degrees\nto avoid going over the vessel.\nIt approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400 feet.\nAfter hovering for 30 seconds, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again\nchanged directions.\nThis incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea.\nThe shipmaster believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search.\nBlue Book identified this case as the Cosmos 33 satellite decay, however, this explanation\ndoes not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes.\nIf you would like to read more on ship-based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF\non Maritime UFO and USO research in Blue Book.\nThis stat-rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Blue Book sightings\nbetween the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\nOf the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific.\nThis data highlights while there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot,\nUFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water.\nHistorically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports.\nIn fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive if not more than our own here in the United\nStates.\nOne day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not\nthe topic of our video today because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO\nreports that are indeed worth investigating.\nI will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO Secrets by Paul Stonehill\nand Philip Mantle, however, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy\nof note and can track down additional reporting on.\nMany of these cases are just stories and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified\nfiles like we do with Blue Book, so I will be doing my best to vet these cases.\nLet's dive into a handful of the most interesting.\nOn October 7, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents\nSea.\nIts radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles.\nThe Volga's Captain Tarantyn approached the bridge to see nine bright disks moving in\nfrom the northeast.\nThe disks arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes.\nDuring the encounter, ship comlinks malfunctioned, similar to the major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran\nUFO incident.\nAfter the disks depart, the ship comms and operations return to normal.\nRaising concern in the Soviet Navy, fleet admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov, known\nas the Likr, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic\nscientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to JANAP-146C and OpNAP Directive 3820.\nThe directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. Asaza and signed\nby Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr Novoitsev.\nThis case was not only discussed in Russia's USO Secrets, but also in Jacques Valais'\nbook UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union, a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30.\nThe link to the book, free of course, will be in the video description, so check that\nout for yourself.\nKamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia.\nThe almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Akhatsk from the Pacific Ocean.\nAccording to Russia's USO Secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin\nSolomchakov, on a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting\nresearch within a motorboat on Kamchatka Lake.\nSuddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of\nthe lake, in which rose a grey-colored oval object, estimated to be 40 to 60 meters in\nlength.\nThe object rose to an altitude of nearly 100 meters and hovered motionlessly.\nAs it did, the motorboat engine stalled, horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated\naway rapidly, restoring functions to their engine.\nWhat fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we\nsee Kevin Knuth discuss at the Sol Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from\nvehicles.\nIn the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I\nhave heard.\nThis information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Ziggle, one of Russia's\nmost well-respected ufologists.\nOn June 15, 77, the Soviet ship Novolkuznetsk navigated the Gulf of Gayaquil, Ecuador,\na radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent\nsphere rose from the water.\nIt flew around the ship, hovered 20 meters over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged, and\ndove back into the water.\nAnd with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nI'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on USOs from 2006,\nwhere we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon.\nI highly recommend checking out this whole documentary, and of course the link will be\nin the description.\nBut one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO slash USO government documentation is\nAustralia.\nThe Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers, and files on anomalous\nsightings.\nIn fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported, UAS Unusual\nAerial Sighting, occurred on January 23rd, 1964, and describes, quote, seen at sea by\ncrew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia.\nLarge lights and water made compass go haywire, shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise,\ncausing lights to pulsate, end quote.\nThe tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO-USO encounters\nand certainly not missed by Australia.\nA report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting.\nAround this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings\nseriously.\nSee these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included\nalongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman\nobserving a light shoot up from the water, hover, and disappear.\nAustralian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters very\nsimilar to both the fisherman encounter and our 1977 Soviet encounter.\nThis 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and\nlocal Aussies observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height, curve\nand return to the oceans.\nMany of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes once returned to sea.\nWe're back to our SS City of Almaco case in Project Blue Book.\nIt is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized\nthese could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams, however this\ndoes not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and\nAmericans.\nOutside of the Australian government, the citizens of the land down under have some fascinating\nstories of USOs.\nshooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers.\nIn 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederick Walter and Emma Flavel observed five gray oblong\nobjects, rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast.\nThis sighting was also observed by two railroad workers who described five white or light\npink egg shaped objects, rise from the sea but with the added detail of quivering, similar\nto our MV Marcolla case mentioned earlier in the video.\nCigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history.\nAround the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a\ncase that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review, 1966-67.\nPrivate pilot C. Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing four or five\nmysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island.\nApproaching the objects from the sky, there appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow\nand up to 100 feet long accompanied by three smaller objects.\nThe two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the\naircraft approached within two miles.\nInitially thought to be whales or submarines, the men in independent sightings from nearby\nSeabrae Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost\nlike they did not interact with the water.\nThis interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the HMNZS Southland case Knuth describes\nat the Seoul Foundation, which oddly enough occurred near New Zealand.\nWe all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he\nand his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle\nof the ocean in the middle of the night.\nBut I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case.\nWhat I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th\ncentury that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau.\nOn November 12, 1887, Captain R.F. Moore of the English steamer the SS Siberian encountered\na USO 10 nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland.\nThe captain observed an enormous fireball.\nRise from the sea to 50 feet, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky.\nAt the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and\nmost difficult to explain electrical phenomena.\nBut as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea.\nIn Africa, the Gulf of Guinea 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed\nan immense object sinking into the ocean.\nThe cigar shaped object measured nearly 200 meters long and 300 meters wide.\nAs the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights\nlit at the front and two blue-green lights shining at the other end.\nThis case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine.\nHowever, seen as popular submarines at this time such as the early German U-boat measured\nsolely 41 meters long, I still find this case anomalous.\nAnd now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel.\nThroughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon\nobserved by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere.\nAnd it's worthy to note, this just wasn't an isolated incident.\nIn fact, the Maritime Light Wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned\nearlier.\nWe had information that in the ocean, in the seas, in our inner seas,\nthere were cases of some kind of strange phenomena related to the light of water.\nOctober of 1969, the Arabian Sea.\nThe command of the Soviet scientific vessel Vladimir Vorobyev unexpectedly woke up\nwithout any sign of fear.\nThe instruments showed that the massive object was at a depth of 20 meters.\nIt was still one and a half hundred meters long.\nThey ran to the deck.\nNo, this is not a submarine, as we thought at first.\nIn the depths of the sea, against the clock arrow, slightly bent,\nthere were eight bright rays of the length of 200 meters.\nThe fiery continued for more than half an hour.\nThen the spot fell apart into several parts and disappeared.\nTwo years before that, the source of light was able to be seen.\nIt was in 1967, in the Samzalivi.\nThe sailors of several Dutch ships then observed the rotation of huge\nglowing wheels on the water.\nAnd from the Glenfolle hot spring, it was clearly seen that the object\nthat was shining on the water was 20-30 meters in diameter.\nWhat was it?\nThe question remained unanswered.\nIn the sea, many times, there were glowing wheels\nthat our famous construction engineer, Krylov, called\nunderwater ghosts.\nThe size of the wheels is sometimes huge, up to several kilometers.\nAnd many times, they can be seen even from space.\nThey are rarely moved, and quite quickly.\nThe brightness of the glow on the surface of the sea is such that\nthe glare is sometimes visible on the clouds.\nWhat is it? Without the glow of microorganisms?\nBut how to explain the amazing symmetry\nand the huge speed of rotation of the light wheels?\nSometimes the clouds slip on the surface of the sea\nwith the speed of a racing car.\nMicroorganisms cannot move so quickly.\nMoreover, the test of water from the wheels often shows\nthat there are no even traces of the glowing plankton.\nThe light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by\nspokes of brilliant white light.\nThat can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air,\nserving as a possibly trans-medium craft.\nI must note, also as they talked about in the video,\nsome attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction\nbetween bioluminescent algae and pressure waves\nin an otherwise calm water. However,\nI do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus\non the existence. But let's review the earliest sightings\nof these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many,\nmany more sightings of the maritime light wheel\nthat have been observed, but I just want to recount a few of the earliest.\nOn March 27th, 1873,\nthe ship Adelheid voyage from Leban to Singapore.\nCaptain Ledman noticed a peculiar, blinding,\nmilky white light. Appear beneath the waves\nabout two ship lengths from the vessel.\nFlakes of light described as, quote, flakes of snow\nwhen driven over the rocks by a strong wind, end quote.\nThe light followed the ship traveling at four to five knots\nfor roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing.\nLedman stated he had not seen anything like this\nin his 26 years of maritime life.\nWe can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia,\nmentioned in an 1873 news article in the Argus.\nAn almost USO flap\nwas experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901.\nAn initial USO sighting\nwas reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans,\na hydrographer for the British Navy on May 15th, 1879.\nJ. E. Pringle of the HMS Vulture\nreported, quote, luminous waves\nor pulsations in the water,\nmoving at great speed, end quote, passing under the vulture.\nIt was at this time Pringle noticed two objects\nin the east and west, what appeared to be, quote,\nrevolving wheels with a center on that bearing\nand whose spokes were illuminated, end quote.\nWorthy to note, these two wheels were rotating\nin equal and opposite directions, and the spokes\nwere about 25 feet in length.\nIt is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water\nas the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here.\nThe second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880\nby British India Company steamer Patna.\nCaptain Avern, Mr. Manning Third Officer\nand others observed two enormous luminous wheels\nappear on each side of the ship near 11.30 p.m.\nThe wheels were, quote, whirling around,\nthe spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship.\nThe spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long\nand resemble the birch rods of the Dame School.\nEach wheel contained about 16 spokes,\nand the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter.\nThe spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around, end quote.\nThe men described the appearance of the spokes\ncould almost be represented by standing in a boat\nand flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally\nalong the surface of the water, round and round.\nThe final Persian encounter with this USO\nwas observed on April 4th, 1901,\nwhere Captain Hosean of the steamship Kila encountered, quote,\nVash shafts of light suddenly appeared.\nShaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea,\nbut it was only a faint light and in about 15 minutes died out,\nhaving appeared suddenly and having died out gradually.\nThese shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour.\nFrom earlier the year of 1880, I just mentioned,\nthis wheel-like object was possibly seen off the Malabar coast of India\non January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan.\nAri Harris describes a clear night over calm waters,\nstars shining bright and no moon present.\nAt roughly 10 p.m. Harris and the shift's third officer\nnoticed a milky white circle in the sky,\nresembling, quote, the nebulae sometimes seen in the heavens.\nApproaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel\nto try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object\nand its waves of light.\nThe last old example here I will cover\noccurred on the 10th of June, 1909\nand was actually featured in Scientific American,\nissue 106-51, which relays\nthe Nautical Meteorological Annual\npublished by the Danish Meteorological Institute,\na report on a quote, singular phenomena.\nWhile sailing through the Straits of Malacca,\nCaptain Gabe of the SS Bintang\nobserved a vast revolving wheel of light under the water,\nquote, long arms issuing from a center\naround which the whole system appeared to rotate, end quote.\nSurfacing, this wheel was so vast,\nthat half of it could be seen at a time\nwith the center laying near the horizon,\nthe wheel was able to move forward\nand vary in speed and rotation,\ndisappearing when the center was right under the vessel.\nAnd like our last 1880 case,\nthese maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water.\nIn the same Danish Meteorological Institute,\nthere reports another instance in 1910,\nwhere Captain Breyer of the Dutch steamship Valencien\nwas sailing in the South China Sea.\nHere, the captain, first and second mate\nand the first engineer all observed\nan object hovering above the water, quote,\nit looked like a horizontal wheel, rapidly turning.\nMy friends, thank you so much for watching today,\nas we took a deeper dive into USOs throughout history.\nPlease excuse the rash guard I'm wearing,\nI just got home from training, but phalanx if you're watching,\nI'm always open for a sponsor.\nBut anyways guys, I got such a great reaction\nfrom my first video on USO, I had to make a follow up\nand show that it doesn't matter what time period we're in,\nit doesn't matter what country we're in,\nthere are stories of unexplained things in the water.\nAs far as the maritime light wheel goes,\nI'm pretty torn on that whether that is a craft object\nor possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena.\nI'll include in the video description\na kind of not really debunk but a paper,\nkind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena,\nbut still, the fact that these are seen in the Persian Gulf,\nin Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me,\nbut even more fascinating to me are Australian,\nBlue Book, and Soviet Files.\nAll depicting very similar experiences,\ntic-tac-shaped craft, slash cigars,\nfireballs exiting the water,\nfireballs exiting the water that are almost curious about the ship,\negg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists,\nbut we see multiple cases of these sort of lightballs\nleaving the water dancing around\nand shooting off into the sky or back into the water.\nAs far as the tic-tacs go,\nwe often see these things hovering slightly above water\nand multiple cases saying they're quivering or gyrating\nor slowly submerging under the water\nbut not affecting the water surface\nsimilar to the case Kevin Knuth talks about.\nSo I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena\nby looking in our oceans.\nThere's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about,\nbut couldn't really find reputable sources for,\nsuch as some Chilean incidents\nthat supposedly in the military,\na fleet of saucers approached a craft.\nBut until then, we'll just keep digging in case files.\nIt's a shame that there's not a lot of information at Blue Book.\nWe can thank OPNAV3820 and JANAP146C for that,\nbut we'll work with what we're given.\nIf one day I can get in contact with George Knapp\nand see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia\npertain to USO, I would very much like to do that.\nBut where I stand now,\nUSO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon.\nThe fact that these craft can operate in air\nor under sea trans-medium objects\nwithout really changing their flight characteristics\nis insane to me.\nSo if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary,\nit's actually really darn good.\nI highly suggest watching it.\nIt does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USOs.\nAnd of course, you can listen to someone talk in a Russian accent\nfor 45 minutes, so that's great.\nAs always, guys, thank you so much for watching.\nI've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately,\nwith the Kingman video and getting retweeted by Ross.\nSo that's been great.\nI love all of you guys.\nThanks so much for being here.\nRemember to like and retweet.\nLeave a comment on the video.\nLet me know what you think.\nLet me know what cases, crashes, whatever you want me to tackle next.\nThat has to do with the phenomenon, of course.\nNothing random.\nSo just let me know.\nAnd again, thanks for being here, guys.\nI'll catch you on the next video.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"videopages/USO%20Case%20Book%EF%BC%9A%20Unidentified%20Submerged%20Objects%20Throughout%20History/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<ul> <li>TXT</li>
