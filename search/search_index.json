But on this planet, and throughout the Cold War, UAP has had an interest in humanity's harnessing of the atom, and in some direct cases, actually tampered with or disabled Nuclear Warheads. </p> <p>In this video, we will cover the fascinating cases of Lt. Robert Jacob's Vandenberg AFB UFO footage and the Malmstrom Minuteman Missile shutdown case, two of the most perplexing and well-documented UFO nuclear encounters.</p> <p>The credibility of these cases cannot be understated - Jacob's case was reported to Dr. Kirkpatrick of AARO in 2023 and the Malmstrom case was directly confirmed by David Grusch in his 2023 News Week article. BOTH cases feature sworn affidavits by multiple witnesses.</p> <p>Why are UFOs so interested in nuclear weapons? Is it because whatever non-human intelligence piloting these craft is frightened of human weaponry being used against them or something a little more scientific, like an observation of a civilization encountering the great filter? We can only guess until we have more data, but cases like these help us begin to hypothesize. </p> <p>Thank you for watching UAP Gerb Gang and please remember to like and subscribe!</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:38 Jacobs UFO Tape 8:15 Malmstrom AFB Incident 11:13 1977 FOIA Reports 11:42 Indian Point Nuclear Station UFO 13:22 Conclusion</p> <p>Lt.

It is Gerb. Welcome back to the channel. Join me today as we start a six-part series into the Alien and UFO Obscure Oddities Iceberg, posted to Reddit by user BlikeSama. Now, for those of you who don't know what an iceberg is, an iceberg is a way of categorizing the most known to least known components of an overall topic or theme. So think of an iceberg in real life how the iceberg you see above the surface is only scratching the surface of the entirety of the iceberg below the waters. So we have six layers to this iceberg. As we start with the first layers, we're going to have some pretty well known subjects, stuff you might have heard of as we get deeper into level five, six, we're going to get into more fringe theories and some stuff I might not have heard of. So it should be a learning process for all of us. I'd like to disclaim that I did not make this iceberg, so I do not have control over the entries within it. On this channel, I like to keep things as factual as I know them to the UFO UAP phenomena. So if there's something that's rather bogus or absolutely absurd, I'm going to say so. And if there's something I strongly agree with, I'm also going to say so. So let's get this started. But before we kick it off, please consider liking and subscribing. I really like making these videos. So the more support I get, the more of an urge I have to make some quality content and some good documentaries. If you haven't seen it yet, check out my first video with the documentary on the Wilson Davis Memo. It's not bad, could be better, and it will be better. So stick around. Let's get started, guys. Layer one. We'll call this the Observered Layer. Extraterrestrial life simply refers to any life that does not originate from Earth. From a single celled organism to a highly advanced civilization that can traverse the stars in a matter of hours or days, these all classify as extraterrestrial life. So not the most challenging concept to understand, but this first entry just boils down to any life, carbon, or otherwise, silicon, that does not originate from Earth. Crop circles are a phenomena in which large-scale structures are created into a field, generally a wheat field. These structures are often pretty interesting and beautiful due to their symmetry or geometric designs. And because of the complexity of the designs, a lot of people like to attribute crop circles to paranormal or extraterrestrial phenomena. Widely considered hoaxes, the craze of crop circles began in 1991, where two pranksters, Doug Bauer and Dave Chorley, took credit for making the initial wave of crop circles with planks of wood, rope, and baseball caps. Many of the seemingly bizarre creation tactics of crop circles can be explained away by skeptics, including tie an end of a rope to an anchor point on the other end to a board, which is used to crush or flatten plants. There's also a method to bend crops after a recent rain that was discovered in Hungary in 1992. The point is, while crop circles are beautiful and interesting and have wonderful designs, I think it's likely, extremely likely, these are human-made and, in my opinion, not very interesting, so I'm not going to spend more time on it. The McMinnville UFO Photographs are some of the most famous photographs of a UFO ever taken. On May 11, 1950, farmers Paul and Evelyn Trent saw something inexplicable near their farmhouse in McMinnville, Oregon. When walking back to her farmhouse, Evelyn noticed a slow-moving metallic disc-shaped object heading in her direction from the northeast. After gilling for her husband, Paul came outside, also seeing the object. He grabbed his camera and was able to take two photographs of the metallic disc near his home. Due to the popularity of these photographs, the negatives were loaned to William H. Hartman, an astronomer on the Condon Committee in 1967. The objective of the Condon Committee outside of the University of Colorado Boulder was to investigate UFOs and was a government-funded UFO research project. I'd like to do another video on the Condon Committee because the program was basically told to explain UFOs away as swamp gas and weather balloons, but Hartman found some extremely interesting oddities with these photographs. Hartman was impressed with the images, noting that the brightness of the underside of the craft appeared to be lighter than the underside of the oil tank also seen in the images. He said this was possibly due to atmospheric extinction, the same effect that makes distant mountains appear washed out and blue in images. This effect suggested that the object was further from the camera than the tank, not a small, local object hanging from a string like some debunkers like to claim. He wrote to the Condon Committee that, quote, this is one of the few UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological, and physical appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disc-shaped, tens of meters in diameter and evidently artificial flew within sight of two witnesses. Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bound. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. Alien invasion simply refers to a worldwide invasion by an extraterrestrial species. Now, I like to think that an invasion by an extraterrestrial species is pretty unlikely. It's impossible, of course, to attribute human motives to a non-human intelligence, but if extraterrestrials have the ability to traverse the cosmos and warp spacetime, it seems rather idiotic that such an advanced species would be warmongering like we are. In my opinion, humans would be more interesting to study from a distance. A hairless primate that has recently discovered how to harness nuclear technology and is at the foot of exploring our solar system or destroying ourselves. It's a pretty interesting place in which our species is residing. Perhaps this is something like the great filter that the Fermi Paradox talks about, but alien invasion, scary, but likely, in my opinion, no. Panspermia is a theory that life exists throughout the entirety of the universe in microbial or cellular form and is distributed by space dust, meteors, asteroid comets, and planetoids. Let's tackle this with an example. One possible origin of life here on Earth is a result of panspermia. Millions and millions of years ago, Mars had life, whether this was single cellular or multicellular, we don't know. But if panspermia occurred, that means an asteroid or a meteor or something large impacted Mars' surface. This kicked up much Martian soil and dust containing microbes. That dust and particles then made their way over to Earth, where the seeds of life were carried from one planet to another. There are three types of panspermia, lithopanspermia, which means life being carried from one solar system to another, ballistic panspermia, which is life carried from one planet to another within the same solar system, and directed panspermia. This would be human sending life to other planets, essentially. The Men in Black are a shadowy organization featured prominently in Ufology and UFO folklore. Essentially, the Men in Black are suit clad government agents who are used to question, interrogate, threaten, harass, and sometimes assassinate, experiencers of UFOs and extraterrestrials. The legend of the Men in Black can be traced back to June 27, 1947. Harold Dahl was on a conservation mission on the Puget Sound near the eastern shore of Washington's Mowry Island. I believe he was gathering logs or just doing some outdoor work when he saw six donut-shaped obstacles hovering about half a mile above his boat. Some debris fell from the obstacles, a piece of which struck and killed his dog. Dahl was able to take pictures of the craft and record some footage. The following day, Dahl was visited by a man in a black suit. The two had to a local diner where the man was able to recount in extreme detail what Dahl had witnessed the night before. The man said, quote, what I have said to you is proof to you that I know a great deal more about this experience of yours than you will want to believe. Dahl was then told not to speak of the incident. If he did, bad things would happen. As a final statement on the Men in Black, I'd like to say that these guys don't always need to be in suits, okay? What you could consider the Men in Black, people opposing any sort of discussion or sharing of information or footage of UFOs could also just be described as men in military fatigues. This is what happened during the Roswell incident with Jesse Marcell and the girl whose fireman father witnessed the crash craft as well as Lieutenant Robert Jacobs in his footage of a UFO disabling a nuclear warhead. So the men can be in suits. That dives a little bit more into the paranormal and weird things or just men in military fatigues blocking any sort of conversation or spreading of information. I would like to mention I think these suit clad men in black are a total hoax and distract from the actual validity of people within the United States government and high ranking officials trying to stop the spread of legitimate UFO sightings and footage. So I am not a fan of the suit clad men in black. I think it's a little bit ridiculous. The Nazca lines. If you have seen ancient aliens on the history channel, I'm willing to bet you have heard of the Nazca lines. If not, no worries. I got you. The Nazca lines are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca desert near southern Peru. It's estimated that most of these pictures depicting animals were created between 500 BC and 500 AD. These large geoglyphs were made by making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert floor, removing stones and pebbles, and leaving different colored dirt to be exposed. Now seen from the ground, the Nazca lines appear as nothing more than lines. But when viewed from an aerial position, the Nazca lines then start to depict the beautiful creatures that they're made to represent. While it's highly likely that the Nazca lines were used for ancient religious purposes, such as offerings to gods who would be able to see the lines from the heavens or other varying rituals, author Eric Von Daniken in his book Chariots 1968 proposed that the Nazca lines were in fact used as landing sites for UFOs. He theorized that the shapes and lines were made by extraterrestrials and were created to help steer their spaceships to land safely. Von Daniken claimed the patterns at the site looked very similar to modern airport designs and used this as pieces of evidence to prove that extraterrestrials used this Nazca plane as a landing space for their spacecraft. I of course favor the prosaic explanation here. I think the Nazca lines were likely used for religious purposes and are also observable from nearby hills and mountains, not just from the air, from airplanes or spacecraft. But it is fun to think about the ancient astronaut theory, I mean that's why ancient aliens has like 30 seasons. The Betty and Barney Hill Incident is one of the most famous alien abduction stories in US history. Their story begins at around 1030 on September 19th 1961. The couple was driving back from a vacation near Niagara Falls in Montreal just south of Lancaster, New Hampshire. Upon driving, Betty observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved just below the moon and the planet Jupiter. Betty noticed the light moved erratically and grew bigger and brighter at various times, and Betty urged Barney to stop the car so the two could take a closer look. Through binoculars, Betty noticed an odd shaped craft travel across the face of the moon with flashing multicolored lights. Initially, Barney thought this may have been a commercial airliner, but as the craft turned towards him and started rapidly descending, he quickly changed his mind. The couple then continued driving, observing the well illuminated craft moving erratically back and forth in the night sky. The object rapidly descended toward the hill's vehicle, causing Barney to stop the car in the middle of the highway. The silent craft hovered about 80 to 100 feet above them, reminding Barney of a large pancake. Barney then claimed to have seen 8 to 11 humanoid figures who were all peering out of the craft's windows looking at him. All but one figure then retreated back into the craft. The one remaining figure communicated with Barney telepathically, giving him a message saying, quote, Stay where you are and keep looking, end quote. Now it's worth mentioning that later on when Barney reported this abduction to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, NICAP, he explicitly stated, quote, Beans were somehow not human. Red lights then began to telescope out of the sides of the craft and a long structure descended from the bottom of the craft, approaching Barney. The couple then arrived home, perplexed, noticing that their memories became incomplete and fragmented after observing the craft buzzing towards them. About 10 days after the incident, Betty began having strange vivid dreams for five successive nights. Within these dreams, she was escorted by small humanoids five to five feet four inches tall with Barney walking behind her. She recalls after being walked with the humanoids being set back by her car, where the leader suggests they wait for the craft's departure. The hills then sought hypnosis to explain their missing time after their encounter. Seen as their 178 mile drive home from their vacation should have taken about four hours, but their drive took seven, meaning there were three hours of missing time where they could not explain what happened. Barney's first session of hypnosis is extremely disturbing. He recalls running from the UFO back to his car. He recalls driving away from the UFO, but felt an irresistible urge to pull off the road and drive into the woods. Upon doing so, he cited six figures standing on the dirt road. He described these figures very similar to what occurred in Betty's dreams. Barney said the beans stared into his eyes with a terrifying effect. Barney said, quote, Oh, those eyes, they're in my brain. And, quote, I was told to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mind. And I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes, end quote. And finally, quote, All I see are these eyes. I'm not even afraid that they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing against my eyes, end quote. Betty's recollections from hypnosis were remarkably similar to Barney's. In her hypnosis session, she recalls being aboard the craft, talking about the technology she saw and a star map she observed within what she guessed was the craft's control room. Now, this star map is pretty controversial, as some interpretations show it bearing soul, our sun, as well as the creatures coming from the Zeta reticuli system. And there has been a back and forth into this star maps authenticity, including a rebuttal by Carl Sagan in the 1980s cosmos. But even members on the Condon UFO report, as mentioned earlier, said the odds of this being a random configuration of stars were quote, at least 1000 to one against, end quote. There's a lot more to the Betty and Barney Hill incident, a lot more to study and a lot more to talk about. I can't give it justice in this couple minute segment, but that's a brief overview. Rawleism is a UFO religion dating back to the 70s in France, founded by Claude Vorihon. The religion teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity using their advanced technology. Now, key historical and religious figures such as Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad have been mistaken for gods throughout history, even though they were just Elohim. The Elohim created 40 human Elohim hybrids who have served as prophets throughout the history of humanity. The religion believes that since the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, humanity has entered an age of apocalypse and will destroy itself with nuclear annihilation unless it finds a way to peacefully harness these technological developments. Because of this upcoming apocalypse, the Rawleians have sought to build an embassy for the Elohim that incorporates a landing pad for their spaceship. This religion slash cult isn't harming anybody, so it's kind of fun to read about, and it's not as dangerous as some other UFO death cult. So yeah, fun little read. The Kardashev Scale is a fascinating method of measuring the civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy the civilization is capable of harnessing. The Kardashev Scale was first proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. There are traditionally three types of Kardashev civilizations. Type one, a planetary civilization, is able to harness all available energy from their planetary system. This gives the civilization control over the entire planet's natural forces, including weather and other various phenomena. A type two is a stellar civilization, a civilization that is able to harness all available energy from their host, star. This is done through hypothetical methods such as a Dyson Sphere, which we'll touch on later. And the type two civilization is able to occupy other planets and other moons within their system. Finally, a type three civilization is known as a galactic civilization. A galactic civilization is able to control energy on the scale of their entire host galaxy. Type three civilizations are able to travel across, stars to stars, and colonize their entire home galaxy. Now the Kardashev Scale increases to a Kardashev four and a Kardashev five, in which a civilization is able to control the total energy output of a galactic cluster, and a type five where the civilization can control the energy output of an entire universe, but we don't know if that's theoretically possible. You may ask yourself where does Earth and humans fall on the Kardashev Scale? We are currently about a 0.7 rating on the Kardashev Scale. The Phoenix Lights refers to a mass UFO sighting in a boomerang or V formation over Phoenix, Arizona in March 13 1997, and persists as one of the largest and most perplexing mass sightings of a UFO in US history. The sightings of hundreds of people are often explained away by the official narrative that these sightings was due to flares and flying formations of A-10 Thunderbolt 2 aircrafts. But the governor of Arizona himself, Fife Simen, observed the event and attempted to make an official inquiry, but was denied. He's quoted as saying, quote, I'm a pilot, and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. In 2017, Simington also wrote an editorial piece for CNN which he further discussed his experience with the Phoenix Lights. He said he observed a large delta-shaped craft which moved silently in the sky. He said it was dramatically large with, quote, very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights, end quote. He expressed his dissatisfaction in the Air Force's official explanation of test flares and claimed he did in fact see a large craft. The truth here, I'm not sure. The flare explanation can be valid for some sightings such as Jeremy Corbell's Palm Spring UFO footage in 2023. But due to the witness testimony of hundreds of people, including the governor of Arizona himself, I'm not sure we can rule out the possibility a strange and anomalous craft flew over the city of Phoenix, Arizona. The Battle of Los Angeles is a famous event that occurred in the city of Los Angeles, California, on late February the 24th of 1942. Fresh off of the attack on Pearl Harbor and entry into World War II, the U.S.'s war nerves were at a relative all-time high, expecting any time an attack from Japan on the western coast. Over a number of hours, multiple radar signatures were detected, sending the local military into a scramble. An impending threat of attack by the Japanese was expected, prompting an aerial bombardment. One quote from the scene says, quote, the air erupted like a volcano, end quote. Five civilians died in the aerial bombardment, three from car accidents, two from heart attacks. But later on, it was determined that the reasoning behind the aerial bombardment was war nerves or a meteorological balloon. A photo was then published in the LA Times on February 26th of 1942. The photo show searched lights focused on what looks to be a saucer-type spacecraft. However, it's controversial that this photo may have been altered, heavily altered, and thus might not be an actual representation of what exactly the search lights and artillery cannons were shooting at. But this is an interesting story. The Battle of Los Angeles is actually one of the cases that got me into the study of UFOs as a young kid. Nowadays, I don't think it's that interesting. I think that there's probably a likely prosaic explanation here, but I have a lot of nostalgia for this case. But interesting nonetheless. The reptilian theory is a conspiracy theory that was proposed by David Ike. Essentially, the reptilian theory talks of a shape-shifting reptilian race of aliens that is evil and slowly taking control of Earth by taking on human form and gaining political or social power to manipulate human entities. First introduced in 1999 in Ike's book The Big Secret, reptilians are tall, blood drinking, shape-shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconi star system hiding in underground bases and in plain sight. These reptiles have a conspiracy against humanity, whether that means to take over the world, subjugate humanity, or whatever. I'm not quite sure, but numerous people including the Rothschilds, Bush, and British royal family are reptiles, according to Ike. There are up to six. The reptilian theory has become one of the world's most popular conspiracy theories, with many internet users trying to find videos of political leaders that have discrepancies in their eyes or lizard eyes, as well as a lot of public places leaning into the conspiracy. For example, I live in Denver, and the Denver International Airport, which has been shrouded in conspiracy, has really leaned into the whole reptilian thing with a lot of posters of reptiles and such. The Pentagon UFO videos finally were eaten. The Pentagon UFO videos refer to a series of three videos taken by the DoD, Air Force, or military regarding UFOs that were classified, but released due to the efforts of Llewella Zondo and Chris Mellon, and published via The New York Times with Leslie Keane and Ralph Blumenthal. These three videos show anomalous craft taken on FLIR footage, labeled Go Fast, Gimbal, and FLIR. I'd like to focus on the Gimbal video as shown here, which was taken in 2015 off the coast of Florida. A targeting pod on an F-A-18 captured this anomalous object, which the pilot said was able to move with no visible propulsion method and stand stationary in severe winds. Now, unfortunately, there's a clip in part of this video that has not been declassified, and this is confirmed by the pilots who recorded this video, as well as Christopher Mellon. But within the rest of the video, this craft rendezvous with a series of other crafts and takes a V formation. That's extremely strange, and I would give anything to be able to see that footage, but clown debunkers like Mick West like to claim that the Gimbal video is a bird, or a jet moving away from the F-A-18, and thus is a lens artifact on the FLIR footage. I like to trust the eyes of the trained pilots who have recorded these videos, not some dude who sits in his basement and tries to debunk every single thing that ever exists on UFOs. So, very curious video. I love this. This is a classic. All three are classics. Area 51. Now, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on Area 51, because I know all of you have heard of it, and I'd like to make a video itself on Area 51, but we'll give a summary. Area 51 is the common name for a highly classified U.S. Air Force base in the Nevada desert, near Groom Lake and former nuclear test ranges. For decades, Area 51 went unacknowledged and was associated with conspiracies of UFOs and experimental aircrafts. In fact, Area 51 wasn't officially acknowledged until 2013, where the CIA publicly acknowledged the base through a Freedom of Information Act request. Many believe that Area 51 isn't just home to experimental aircraft tests like the U-2 tests and reverse engineering foreign adversaries like the MiG jets, but is also housed for reverse engineering and test flights of UFOs. While I don't really want to cover that on this video, I will leave you with this. Pictured on screen is a project patch from Area 51, supplied by Eric Tabor. Eric Tabor is an official UFO whistleblower who submitted a memorandum for record to Arrow, the all-domain anomaly resolution office, that this patch belonged to his great uncle, Sam Yerkuhart. I'm not sure how to pronounce his name, it's a little tough to spell. But his great uncle divulged to him that while working at Area 51 as a contractor, he was privy to learn that the base housed an egg-shaped UFO that was found intact in the Nevada desert. It's worth noting that Sam was the head of security for an engineering group, the radar cross-section training team, so it's not wild to think he was privy to some strange information. True or not, this is extremely interesting as Tabor has submitted a legal document to Arrow testifying that this is, in fact, true. So maybe Area 51 has housed UFOs. But we'll save that for another time. The Nordic aliens are a supposed race of extraterrestrial humanoids who come from the Pallades system and resemble Nordic Scandinavians. The Nordics are often taller than regular humans, six to seven feet tall, have blue eyes, fair skin, and long blonde hair. Throughout the 1950s, many people alleged to have encounters with the Nordic aliens claiming they were benevolent and magical, often caring about humans and the world's prosperity. The Nordics were able to communicate with humans via telepathy and possessed a cool calming demeanor that proved to be youthful, affectionate, and kind. The Nordic aliens are part of a galactic federation and traverse the cosmos from their spherical to cigar shaped crafts. Interestingly enough, if you've heard of the abduction case of Travis Walton, a film was made about him called Fire in the Sky, I'd recommend checking it out. But Travis Walton has a very curious abduction story that has a lot of intriguing aspects to it, let's just say that. And from his testimony, when he's taken aboard a UFO craft, he encounters several types of beings, such as the common graze, including a Nordic like race of tall humanoids. Are the Nordic aliens real? I don't know. I don't like to focus too much on abduction stories or extraterrestrial races. I just like to focus on the fact there is something in our sky that's of non human intelligence or multiple things in the sky of non human intelligence and start there. We got a lot to work through before we start deciphering what exactly these things are if they're even extraterrestrials. The graze are the archetypal extraterrestrial and most famous depiction of extraterrestrials ever. Often just referred to as graze, graze are typically gray skinned, small humanoid beings between three and five feet tall, completely hairless, with enlarged heads, sometimes a small slit like mouth, sometimes no mouth, sometimes just nostrils, sometimes no nostrils, and large black piercing eyes. The graze often lack muscular definition and have a visible skeletal structure. I want to stress with their head size, their head is usually comically larger than their body. Now the gray can possibly be traced all the way back to 1917, where occultist Aleister Crowley performed a black magic ritual and was able to contact a bean named Lamb across space and dimensions. But I like to look at the fact the graze really became popular in the 1947 Roswell crash. These were the supposed beans that were found dead or dying by their crashed craft a little bit northwest of Roswell, New Mexico. I'd like to make a long video on Roswell because it's fascinating, but also remember Betty and Barney Hill. These small humanoid beings match the depiction of graze as well. In fact, graze are so commonly involved with alien abductions. Graze make up about 50% of claimed abductions or sightings in Australia, 73% in the US, 48% in continental Europe, and 12% around the UK. There are many interesting theories about what exactly the gray is, some of them being the graze are basically biological drones utilized by other extraterrestrial civilizations. Graze are often described as emotionless, kind of hive-minded and worker bees, so this could imply that they're just biological drones. Graze sometimes are often associated with future humans as well, claiming that as humans evolve we rely less on our muscles, spend more time indoors, receive more receding hair across our bodies, get enlarged eyes from looking at screens. And that's interesting to think about too. I'm not sure about that I like it, but also that graze are just humanoid figures that evolved on a planet with somewhat similar conditions to Earth. Regardless of where they originate, the graze are fascinating and I somewhat believe some sort of non-human intelligence on this planet resembles the classic gray. Little green men, I'm not going to spend time on this one, especially since little green men are essentially green graze, and the term little green men is often used by politicians to kind of shrug off and make fun of any UAP or UFO sightings. You'll often time see Pentagon conversations or official military talks when talking about UFOs, say we found no evidence of little green men, so I just have no interest entertaining this entry. I understand I'm getting a little bit pressed about this, but yeah, I stop here. Hoya Bashu is essentially the most haunted forest in the world. It's nestled in Romania and has many unexplicable and strange phenomena such as UFO sightings. I've never heard of this forest. I really don't have much to say about this entry besides apparently in the 1960s there have been UFO sightings in the forest and images taken. And lastly we have the 1952 Washington DC UFO incident. This mass sighting of UFOs occurred over the weeks of July 19th through the 20th and July 26th through the 27th of 1952. At 11.40 pm on Saturday July 19th 52 Edward Nugent an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport spotted seven objects on his radar. He knew immediately that this was a very strange situation as the crafts moved erratically compared to any normal aircraft. Nearby two controllers at the national airport's radar equipped control tower looked outside and saw a hovering bright light in the sky which departed at incredible speeds. At this point other objects appeared in all sections of the radar scopes and they moved over the White House the U.S.'s capital. Jets were scrambled from nearby Newcastle Air Force Base in Delaware to investigate the six fast moving bright lights over the nation's capital. The jets found no such objects they eventually ran out of fuel and had to return to their bases. Later on on July 26th 1952 the event occurred again where a pilot and stewardess on a national airline's flight into Washington DC observed erratic moving lights above their aircraft. Within minutes both radar centers at national airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked the objects. The occurrence made front page headlines and caused a great deal of concern for President Harry Truman who made personal calls to his Air Force aides to find out what the heck happened as well as garnered much CIA interest. In response to this event the Robertson panel was formed to quote strip the unidentified flying objects of their special status they have been given in the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired end quote. So the 1952 UFOs over DC directly leads to the decades long stigma around UFOs and this is very interesting and I'll make another video about this. Well my friends that is layer one to the alien and UFO obscure oddities iceberg. I hope everybody enjoyed this first layer a ton of interesting entries looking down the list we're going to have a lot more extremely interesting things to cover and I cannot wait. Remember if you liked the video consider tossing out a subscription and a like doesn't cost you nothing and it allows me to make more interesting videos like this so stay tuned friends I'm going to start part two immediately.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/1en219Vk9K4/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Aleister Crowley</li> <li>Alien</li> <li>Alpha Draconi</li> <li>Arrow</li> <li>Barney</li> <li>Barney Hill</li> <li>Betty</li> <li>Bush</li> <li>Carl Sagan</li> <li>Chris Mellon</li> <li>Christopher Mellon</li> <li>Claude Vorihon</li> <li>Dahl</li> <li>Dave Chorley</li> <li>David Ike</li> <li>Davis Memo</li> <li>Doug Bauer</li> <li>Edward Nugent</li> <li>Eric Tabor</li> <li>Eric Von Daniken</li> <li>Evelyn</li> <li>Evelyn Trent</li> <li>Gerb</li> <li>Graze</li> <li>Groom Lake</li> <li>Harold Dahl</li> <li>Harry Truman</li> <li>Hartman</li> <li>Hoya Bashu</li> <li>Ike</li> <li>Jeremy Corbell's</li> <li>Jesse Marcell</li> <li>Kardashev</li> <li>Kardashev Scale</li> <li>Lamb</li> <li>Leslie Keane</li> <li>Llewella Zondo</li> <li>Mick West</li> <li>Muhammad</li> <li>Niagara Falls</li> <li>Nikolai Kardashev</li> <li>Nordic Scandinavians</li> <li>Nordics</li> <li>Paul</li> <li>Ralph Blumenthal</li> <li>Robert Jacobs</li> <li>Roswell</li> <li>Rothschilds</li> <li>Sam</li> <li>Sam Yerkuhart</li> <li>The Kardashev Scale</li> <li>Travis Walton</li> <li>Von Daniken</li> <li>William H.

Okay. Can you guys can anybody hear me? I'm trying to set this up. I'm still pretty pretty new to lives Just trying to check this out, I think we got three Okay, oh, what's up quitter? How you doing, man? Okay, what's up guys? I'll wait I'm waiting for some people to join But I just kind of wanted to chill with everybody for a little bit I know we got some good videos out some interesting cases I'm actually leaving tomorrow for a trip overseas. So I just kind of wanted to check in with everybody See what everybody's working on Kind of understand what cases you guys are looking at also when I get some more people in here I wanted to get some book recommendations from everybody for my trip Good a long plane ride to Japan. So thus far. Let me see what I got Alexander I am going to Japan So I'm doing a little trip to Tokyo and Kyoto tomorrow and it's really weird being on a live Talking to myself. You're not talking to myself, but you know what I mean. So for books I'm rereading Michael Schratz Crash retrievals of the third kind if any of you guys have heard of that It is where Schrat got to go through Leonard Stringfield's personal archives in Cincinnati at Mufon And he touched on some cases that Stringfield had in the crash. Oh, what's up, Joey? What up, Joey? Joey the trip is tomorrow to Japan Okay, I want to I want to Want to talk about that in a second off TV. I I also don't like flying. It's not my favorite But so tomorrow guys for for some of the the books. I mean the day after Roswell. Is that by Bill Moore, Jason? I think it is Because if that's if that is in fact by Bill Moore He also You guys know the the Grant Cameron files right Grant Cameron released all of his files recently Downloadable. He has a lot of contacts with Bill Moore. They had a email connection. This was back in I think 1998 and they were discussing the Kalahari Desert crash back in 89 in South Africa near the coast of Botswana and of course the primary source for that is a little controversial with a Guy who claimed he or to be claimed he was making up his South African Air Force credentials But Bill Moore in these texts with Grant Cameron in these emails said he had a secondary source for the Kalahari Desert crash So I want to link up with Bill more if I can because he is still living. He's very old I think he was born in 42 and find out who that secondary source is because the how Kalahari crash is great if you guys have ever seen the The video from Mack Maeve and his channel got hacked is taken down. So but that's a great video for when it gets back up UFO connections to Iceland such as crash retrievals or such brother. Yes. I was actually looking at this yesterday. There is a case From the 50s if you look at magic eyes only I actually lived in Iceland for a little bit Let me see if I can remember where this was Okay, it was in the Jukula rivers in August of 1954 According to Ryan S. Wood one of the primary sources here is the 468 CIC detachment document titles unidentified flying objects dated October 11th 1954 so oh, okay. Okay, Philip J. Corso. Yeah, that's the day after Roswell men. Yeah, I see what you're saying that Corso is awesome. I I actually haven't sat down and fully read day after Roswell Which I've only listened to bits and pieces or just kind of reference the book when I needed to Are there any reports of UFOs around only nuclear warheads artillery or nuclear facilities in general such as well I know that of course we have Malmstrom and this was with B 52 bombers But in the 50 Monat AFB that is where I think a disc shape craft changed its Its altitude in a very rapid session kind of flew around a descending B 52. That's not the case. I know So well Jimmy shoo, thank you so much for the the $20. I really appreciate that Recommend clear intent government cover-up of UFO. Okay guys, I'm gonna actually grab a piece of paper so I can write this down and What? Get that to that in a second. So All right, also above top secret by Timothy good. That's another good piece. I'm rereading tomorrow and Since I will be meeting up with Ryan S. Wood soon. I'm rereading all of the MJ 12 files Maybe can I send the link to the chat and yes, okay? Let me go through these. Sorry man What is my background and how do I get access the informants that that I give? So my background is mechanical engineering Studied in university got my bachelors in mechanical engineering Currently work in the field more less so mechanical engineering more so just kind of spreadsheets and so forth but when I started my my channel everything initially started as kind of to Talk to friends and family who had an interest in this subject. I was the guy who they had come to to speak to But everything was so discombobulated even my files were just rancid and all over the place. So I started my channel Well, how I got access to these informants was I didn't give a darn about Who I called and who I tried to talk to if you guys remember back to the UFO witnesses and so forth I would just like these guys like MS and TV I just would call people and I would just talk to them. So I wouldn't really care what sort of situation it was in I know that Now it's not really the smartest idea just a cold call because you never know Who's on the other side, but that is how just kind of brute force I I know in this space a lot of people aren't really willing to kind of Put themself if there is a firing line and a firing line But that's how you do it man It's with the the differences with Joey, of course because I made my video on Marines who got close to you to UFOs with Herrera and Wagan and Joey reached out to me So that was a difference in the case No Matthew not high-key smart AF man college was super hard for me The only classes I did really well in were Diffie Q So it's roll mama. Thank you very much. I appreciate that quite a bit and that's a cute gopher or badger Whatever it is so actually what what do you guys think about the MH370 videos? I've tended to stay away from them for now just because I know there's a lot of drama around them And especially because the videos kind of circulate mostly on Twitter and most the research is on Twitter I know that there's a lot of weirdly enough drama in the UAP sphere on on Twitter So that's not necessarily my go-to where I go to kind of look at cases I know a lot of the time whenever I hop on Twitter. I see people in in rooms just kind of a Like drama rooms or something like that. So if you guys want to talk about MH370, I'd love to hear it Yeah, this is also a good question. I see a lot of people talking like You know, how does a random youtuber talk to these people and that's a great question. I am a random youtuber but I just think the difference is like I I Just try really hard to speak to people and You know since starting the channel have been able to make some good connections and you know Talk to some interesting people and kind of gain some respects and so forth. So Like the the start of the channel right now. That's just the beginning. You know, I have my inspirations guys like cold heart And so forth and you know, I would love to over time talk to higher profile whistleblowers Talk to higher profile first-hand witnesses Do more interviews that are more documentary style. I like that versus the traditional I sit on stream yard. I guess it's on stream yard and we talk for two hours In my opinion at least from like what I like to watch on youtube I'm far more interested if an interview has sort of a narrative or documentary around it I know that's the case. I'm going to be doing with ryan s wood. Um Because I really want to do justice to mj12 And I'm faced with a couple options right like make a 30 to 50 minute video Just talking about the documents relaying like each line basically to actual events that have occurred in history or talk to ryan wood Who is kind of as much of an expert as you can possibly get to mj12? And especially his dad who was a private aerospace contractor who started the majestic documents with mr. Wood and so forth So I like that a lot. Read the book that tim taylor wrote zack. That's actually a great idea. I'm going to write that down too Um, and I've heard that as as well. Uh, sorry, I'm just I'm just writing this down from zack real fast I Okay, that's a that's this is a great question. So the essence of mj12 is Back in the 80s. I can't remember if it was 82 87 or What exactly it was but there was a role of documents mailed to some, uh, ufologists such as such as stan freedman and these are The mj12 documents the mj12 purports an organization within the usg established under truman handed to Eisenhower that basically was formed a little bit before Ross well because there are references to the interplanetary phenomenon unit, which is actually really interesting there's actually two references there's a A case protocol for the ipu in mj12 and there's another kind of like nine page guidelines I'll actually maybe in The the discord post that but so there's references to the ipu and of course the ipu the interplanetary phenomenon unit I know I Glanced by that my last video. I'm actually probably going to explore that in the different topic like two Three letter agencies that are kind of unknown in another video coming soon The ipu was referenced so the mj12 purports the original crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that operated with banna bar bush Robert j. Oppenheimer even albert einstein And the thing is these were all labeled hoax by fbi You know if you look at mj12 documents and you look at this I think it's the cia root reading room. You'll just see bogus written across the documents There are hundreds if not thousands of mj12 documents All talking about protocol like the somo one the special operations manual about what to do when a crash team finds biologics to A craft to operational protocol to just discussing cases like the isenhower briefing document in 53 that discusses the 1950 El indio del Rio case and so forth So basically the mj12 is the biggest question of are there legitimate documents? Recorded in the public realm for the crash retrieval and reverse engineering team that dates back to the mid 40s And that's just the simple answer. There's so much more to get into there's so much intrigue So many of the classic ufologists stanton freedmen lennard stringfield bill more Grant cameron All these guys have talked so much about mj12 So I could keep talking about mj12 forever, but we'll say that probably we'll see But the the the thing is philippe If I want to see results in this field I got to be willing to kind of do the hard work that a lot of people don't want to do and You know to to what ends who knows dangerous, maybe I don't know but This is subject is just too important to me to kind of Play the safe road and I appreciate you watched everything. Thank you. It's a ton of great videos coming up, man A ton. I'm really excited. I can't wait to get back in japan the council boys Uh, oh, I think I know who it is. Thank you for the euro's brother Hopefully you're able to go to the manchester card next week If you are let me know because that actually sounds awesome And I'm going to be really jealous except you'll have to be up at like 4 a.m Great job on the recent videos random question. Have you given any thoughts of the alleged Costa Rica sightings in 1971 and the 2007 razor photo? Yeah, actually the 71 photo if I sorry, let me get a sip of my gate or powerade If I'm uh, correct here the 1971 photograph was taken from a geographical coastal mapping plane and it depicts a classic saucer from an elevation of Between 10 to 25 000 feet That's a classic picture. I know it's been referenced a lot by people like uh, linda moulton I think linda moulton howl but and so forth Or sorry leslie keen. I'm sorry, but that is interesting. So is the razor video It's really hard to do an analysis on the razor video because there's so few Frans in which we see the craft And I know so so if you guys don't know what the razor video is It's supposedly a costa rica video of a saucer shaped uap taken in 2007 off a flip phone think a motorola razor This depicts a craft sitting in kind of like a cavern Resting resting resting quickly the camera shows the craft go belly up like bob lasar describes and fly off Now the the big kind of drama here is people asking if A little laxative pain. I didn't even notice that but oh you commented last time and max pain's a great game Especially mass max pain three But so that the the big controversy around that video is some people surmise that the craft is just something suspended on a string And that's sort of the the jerking motion. So that requires some analysis, but it's it's tried to um It's it's difficult to to study that Edward lin I have actually not heard of Edward lin. I'll be completely honest So if you can tell me who that is I'd love to know Big fan of your efforts. Thank you very much. I appreciate that just Trying to have everything I do that I can be open source and You know have the documents for everybody to read themselves and so forth I think in the future, I'll probably make a website just because Over time the cases get a lot more complicated and I reference a lot more So I'd like to have a website with each case log. Maybe a transcript of the video Maybe some snippets like when I reference a clip like David grush talking on jre because You know, if I want to hear David grush talk about stargate, I can only have 30 seconds of footage before I might get My butt hit with copyright So I'd love to have that stuff on a website where there can be a little bit more context to add it in for people who prefer to read What's your opinion on whether or not humans can handle disclosure? This is actually a very good question I think about this all the time I oftentimes like to say yes But you know, what exactly are the uh implications of of Disclosure there's already so much negative discourse in the uap sphere in general and how people look at this topic Uh, sometimes I have to step aside because you know, everybody I talk to are The fine folks who watch my channel and so forth everybody who has an interest in uap Who likes to study uap who has a pretty good case log in their brains of cases But you know when I'm at jujitsu and people come up to me with it Hey, you get you have that ufo youtube channel, right and they start talking it I think the average person the public just thinks Even they're still on the the question of are ufo is real, right? so When the vast majority of an american populace is just still asking the question if ufos are real I'm not exactly sure how Well, a populace could handle the Kind of looming presence of a non-human intelligence on this planet So it's a multi-layered question like we could probably talk about this for hours and hours, but i'm not sure Uh, what's going on with the skinwalker ranch having the presentation or something wilder side? I'm actually going to talk to jesse michael's about this. Um I have talked to him a little bit about it because he spent some time at skinwalker ranch I don't think he saw I don't think he said he saw anything weird But I think he said he experienced like just kind of weird poltergeist phenomena as people call it So I need to talk a little more about that, but it is Rather funny with dr. Shawn Kirkpatrick that image from 2018. He looks like a kid who got his hand caught in the candy jar Does he not he is glaring Glaring at the camera. I've never seen a man look so furious. So You guys know my opinion on dr. S. K. I've made videos or made that video a long time about him And since then there's only more to discuss And so forth. Why does this subject interest you so much? Have you ever had an experience possibly jason? I've possibly had an experience just like everybody. I've seen weird lights in the sky things make Making turns at 90 degree angles zigzagging across the sky But I cannot say concretely that i've seen a definite form of a craft I've talked about this a little bit this subject It has been my primary interest since I was old enough to read one of my first ever books was a book on the betty and barney hill incident I remember reading that when I was basically in diapers and I just This topic is so weird to me because of the abundance of information cases documents testimonies to kind of immerse yourself in But the vile reaction people have back to discount. This is just a common conspiracy. So I think what really interested me first was just the the idea of contemplating UFOs and then The amount of evidence for that juxtaposed with the stigma that has been created. So When I first started my channel, I was mostly interested in just kind of creating a pretty comprehensive database of cases and footage For people to reference but as I move on I'm more interested in actually doing whatever the heck I can to Help disclosure, however, I can in any way I can do that, you know, it's tough. I'm not a military guy. I'm not a politician but Yeah, so I figured my route uh, just like some people before me like Ross could be through journalism and Just trying to inform the public tell herms. Yes, I do and in just a few minutes. I will drop the link in the In the chat Mighty moh, thank you so much. It's okay that you're late to the party You haven't missed too much. We're just kind of talking through questions just chatting um and I would like do you have any book recommendations for me for my trip to japan? um So you can email me at uapgurb at gmail.com. I'm a little bit behind on emails just with how busy I've been So i'm also going to be doing that on the plane Again, that's uapgurb at gmail.com or I will post my discord invite here in a couple minutes fat rodents Subs we need to keep gerbs gerbs producing comment He just said he's a mechanical engineer by day job. Keep him producing. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the support I'm just wondering I had an nde tell me about that I you know the the more you immerse yourself in this Phenomenon kind of the more interesting and the more you move outside the traditional nuts and bolts of fields to study So I'd like to hear about that What are your thoughts on grush being so quiet recently? I do not think that he's not that it's I I do not think that it's because of laziness or Not interest. I think that the best avenues for for grush to affect change right now is probably doing stuff behind the scenes This in my opinion has probably worked with congress lawmakers and so forth I I think he he did what he needed to do in the public with his ross colt hart news nation interview His appearance on jesse michael's and his j re appearance. I I mean in those besides his op-ed, which I still do believe is is on the way um He's pretty much Talked about everything he can publicly, right? So I think the the mostly what he's doing is behind the scenes kona Please email me at uap grow about gmail.com if you have and I haven't responded. I'm just a little bit behind because So dang much going on And thanks before I continue. Thank you guys so much for asking questions and chatting um I really appreciate it and I love talking everybody. I'm trying to get through every single one of these because I'm very honored Pitchforks are coming 30 years and millions of reports later I hunter believe that they have been here since the dawn of mankind. I don't need anyone to approve what I believe I like that mindset more and more Grush has talked about this as well and many other people talk about the antiquity Of the phenomenon, you know, you have the 16th century nuremberg lights With all sorts of shapes dancing around the skies of nuremberg triangles weird crescent shaped craft and so forth all throughout history like the uh I'm trying to remember like the chariots of juda back in the 11th century in a in a Middle eastern war If bob lasar is to be believed one of these craft was found during an archaeological dig Many people who Have a good basis of of credibility to stand on talk about this phenomenon being ancient And I certainly would probably agree patrick Have I looked into emory smith? I have not i'm going to write that name down because Any sort of Uh investigation I haven't done I would love to do Everyone comment on this defeat the algorithm. Thank you op tv. I appreciate that too I I just you know, if I if I need help, I'll reach out to the community. I know I talked about this in the last video, but I I wish I could get content out faster It you know, I like I want the creative process to be mine So I do everything from thinking of the idea to researching to writing the script to filming to editing to posting So I appreciate the patience with all this and you know, if I need some If I if if I need to reach out to people I absolutely will what can the average Working joe due to legitimize the subject more. That's a great question. I mean, um, what I would say personally is to familiarize yourself with factual data Understand the usg's history and studying the uap phenomenon Understand project grudge signed blue book the controversy around osap and atyp uap tf and aro Talk about the unknown unknowns. All of these programs have registered the obfuscation of data the stigma And when you bring up this subject at least what I'd like to do in public is not just to Jump to okay. There's non-human intelligence on this planet There's reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs, but it's just say wait slow down for a second People are still arguing about our ufo is real Well, here's how the u.s. Government has studied ufo since the 1940s And then you can reference the condom report not the 1969 out of cu boulder condom report But I somebody told me I said this wrong conding condom The british mod ufo study that actually referenced the 1989 uh belgian ufo wave of triangles You can also talk about all the australian ufo reports if you're interested in that I think it's my us over d1 I linked to the internet archive where I referenced a couple australian uso reports there's a full archive there And then you can talk about canadian uh lawmakers talking about five eyes nation studying ua uap together. So I would just talk about stick to Introducing people to get comfortable with the fact that ufos aren't just a conspiracy Because the stigma has been so dang success successful at doing that Um, yes, sir jujitsu and mixed martial arts. I love jujitsu Uh, I had training today I might have got a little bit of a concussion because I was doing technique with a youngster He was trying to do a fireman's carry threw me over the back shoulder hit the head a little bit. So hopefully it's okay Thank you. I appreciate that I think disclosure will cause the ontological shock we've heard about to religious people But non-religious people it's an easy pill to swallow. Uh, I've actually I've liked how the vatican has handled Uh discussing this topic in the last couple of years talking about I think they said that god paints with a broad brush You had a catholic priests at the uh last july congressional hearings with grush so I hope I like I hope non-religious people can handle this but at the same time, you know, what are how's the average person going to Just react in general when they find out that there is a presence on this planet that Operates completely different to humans their modus operandi probably still not given out if there's full disclosure why they're here is unknown How many of them are unknown where they're coming from unknown? Just kind of the fact that they're here. Um Yes, I do know who mitiokaku is Uh, I would love to speak to him if you have a way to talk to him. I would really like to talk to him I have a book of his I can't remember what it's called But I've always really enjoyed his appearances on j re uh talking about the phenomenon They've been here Pitchfork, they've been here forever. Nothing will change. I hope I hope that's not the case We are at a pretty pivotal pivotal point in disclosure. I think there's been a couple times where there has been We've been pretty close to Sort of disclosure events, but then moved away for various reasons So I hope things can change now It partly feels like the genie's a bit out of the bottle with people like grush coming out and so much kind of attention on the UAP subject. I know it's still a little niche After all the the excitement died down from the congressional hearings, but let's let's hope with the 2024 ndaa Um, we can continue that. So how do you rationalize what custodian? I don't know who custodian file Or uh, I don't know who custodian file is So please tell me if you can This is a great question on a sliding scale How confident are you that michael herrera is telling the truth? This is so michael's such an interesting case for me to talk about because like With the stuff that joey always talks about kind of the extra evidence that michael has of talking to the insider and so forth It really is one of the most compelling pieces and I can tell you I had a really weird moment where I actually came across this insider completely independently In my own research on another project So that was really kind of weird for me. And no this insider is not anybody i've i've ever covered on the channel I think somebody commented recently on youtube was uh, the witness i recently spoke to was he michael's insider and no he was not but I am Of course, you can't prove Indonesia although although although I am talking or I need to set up a call with somebody who may have some interesting information on On indonesia back in 2009. So there's an individual. I haven't been able to connect with him yet because i've been so busy, but I'd like to talk to him. He says he has something interesting to talk to me about the sliding scale on the high side, brother Love the idea of the website. It would be a lot easier. Yes. Also. What is the best way to help support the efforts? Of course, like So I have I have a patreon I'm not going to continue I'm not going to advertise it too much until I feel like I have a wealth of content that can keep somebody Busy for hours hours on end or until I'm able to get like a weekly live stream and so forth where we can discuss cases and so forth So uh for now if you would watch the videos and share them I that would be I would love it. I would love it. That would mean everything to me To people who can't think past that are they going to invade us? Yeah, I think a lot of that I always think back to the twilight zone episode to serve man or the invading alien force eats people so Yeah, the the question of invasion I hope just because that's been so discussed by hollywood with films like independence day mars attack and so forth I I hope people can start to move past the idea of being invaded by an ny species because people always like to talk about the moniker if If they wanted to invade us they already would have so I I I struggle to kind of wrap my head around that but at the same time, you know Uh non-human intelligence. It's almost impossible to attribute motives to something that doesn't possibly has No relation to human consciousness or synapses. I don't know. That's a it's an interesting question In his latest interview that came out the other day sk tried to play the skinwalker ranch presentation down even more you can Yeah, ever since that, um fugal came up with that photo so Remember green street had that basement office episode or not it. Sorry. I'm sorry He had the interview part two with sk right and that was moved back like a full week or two I I sincerely think that episode was moved back Slowly to do damage control on that photo because the entire second interview was just talking about how sk Didn't know about that presentation And he was kind of blindsided by it and he was just asked to be a consultant on it. So yeah Sk as the kids would say he's kind of a dweeb whether we can handle the disclosure or not is irrelevant If people believe gravity, it's better to warn them not to jump off a cliff. I yeah, I I am one for Kind of what guys like rush a that they're still oversight necessary if there are retrieval and uh reverse engineering programs I think rush at it. I just rewatched his jre interview. He said that nuclear physics are available to study in an undergraduate course But the mechanics of making a nuclear weapon are classified I Like to think in that ran the same realm of thought around uap still humans and the general public deserve Disclosure about what is visiting our planet Possibly where they come from and how they operate. It's their their modus operandi if it's known But if still technology needs to be kept away because of various potentials of it. I still understand The public was yeah, um, I grush talked about this as well. Um, kind of For a forgiveness window for people who may have committed blue collar crime In program duties, whether that be, you know, hiding away funds racketeering embezzlement bribery threats anything he says when it comes down to the harm and Possible murders that people need to be locked up an ab Absolutely, if people have affected human lives and ended them in for this subject. Yes, they do Have you heard of Daniel Salter alien contact intelligence? No, I haven't I'm gonna write that down Daniel Salter I'll check that out, man. I've never heard of it Do you have any posts? I do not yet. I'm still there are a lot of investigations. I'm trying to work on now in the future Kind of I'd like to start talking about kind of a ongoing case logs in the in the patreon So have you ever looked into the connection between ny and psychedelics such as dmt? No, I have not the only thing I know because I have a memory like a hawk Um Is alex jones in 2017 on jre talking about various government organizations using Dmt to connect with some sort of non human intelligence in the spirit realm. I have not I know that I have some family members who have experimented with dmt And I know some of the stuff they have seen is wild in terms of just uh kind of leaving Not really existing in the human Realm of thought anymore. So no, I haven't looked into that but it's very interesting If they're able to travel to this this planet at will that they probably probably do, um, how you been I have been Amazing Thank you very much. If anybody's kind of new to the stream I'm doing this because tomorrow I am taking a trip out of the country So I just wanted to chat with everybody because of course I won't be able to get a video out But I have a lot of projects coming back. I actually might See what people want to see first So on the agenda is I want to do a video on the interplanetary phenomenon unit combined with another Very shadowy unit that might be a little interesting to cover I want to do a video on the kalahari incident if I can talk to bill more Of course, I need to get to kexburg. That's one of the biggest ones the 1941 cape gerudo crash I want to talk about scalar technologies um, I want to talk about Ryan wood and the mj-12 and I might also be meeting doing a little trip with uh, mr. Jesse michael's Maybe we can collaborate on a video That'd be awesome. I would love to do that So you've shown evidence where hundreds of millions are allocated to black programs But that's chump change for something like this. How can you explain the disparity? yeah, I think that um I think that I've just pointed out in some videos like a small number of contracts just to start kind of illustrating a point in terms of especially when contracts are allocated where employees of various companies have said that These large contracts don't have any kind of movement within them And so forth. I know that kathryn austin fits in the 1990s Who talks about the gao failed on it by the pentagon talks about billions upon billions upon billions missing in funds So I just tackle this at a smaller scale, you know Even I can't really conceptualize the billions and billions of billions that go into black programs That are kind of unaccounted for so I just like to analyze from like a small small contract by contract basis and so forth Uh, how do you make sure that you don't fall down the rabbit hole too much? And I'm sure you keep grounded but still open to new data That's actually probably one of the best questions I heard. I I know of of course a couple YouTubers and so forth who cover this topic who have just kind of like struggled. Um, you know, like Studying this so much can have adverse mental health effects I've seen and not just from youtubers but from authors and so forth. So To stay grounded. I think One needs to have a life outside of uh studying uap and for me that is Of course jujitsu, uh, my lovely girlfriend traveling You know, you can be immersed in a rabbit hole. You want the second you go, uh, Somebody tries to strangle you be kind of snap out a bit and are able to stay a little bit grounded but I think part of the the biggest thing now to kind of get trapped with the kind of Misinformation and so forth is to really take my time to digest what I'm hearing And to see how much of new information I can cross reference to existing cases existing documents existing kind of knowledge out there The vetting process in this field is so hard. There's so much misinformation so much misinformation that You know, just got to do the best we can treading very carefully It seems plausible that psychedelics remove our filters that keep us from seeing paranormal phenomena Yeah, so my family members who are actually into psychedelics have talked about like the Brain being a tuner for for human consciousness So I'm trying to remember what they said they talk about how a brain is essentially a tuner for human consciousness and on the psychedelics that uh More information is is taken in by your your filter your brain which it lets you exist in three dimensions I'm trying to think this this still kind of new territory for me as you guys know I'm not always try to be really honest about that. Um Kind of a big nuts and bolts guys so still trying to learn trying to Kind of understand some of those mysteries of consciousness and so forth a little more Uh cracker jack. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I will use this to Train for two days at Kodokan judo in tokyo. So I appreciate that LC the d.o.t. Can't account for half a test is trillions worth of assets. Yeah, trill. Yeah Please Uh, do a video that covers thomas beardan and ning lee. I've heard both of these names before are they associated with ning lee. I'm trying to remember. Let me know but I I absolutely will Do you think the story about the good guys versus the bad guys inside the program is a form of diff's information So people uh thread water loose focus researching dead ends uh I'm not sure. Uh, I Logistically within a these programs like this it would make sense of kind of Interfactionalities and so forth people who advocate for disclosure And people who kind of want to keep the the the lid on disclosure um So that's actually a really good question. I I'm just trying to think of how I can best frame my answer Uh, do you good guys versus bad guys a form of disinformation? I I don't necessarily just due to the amount of first hand people who have come out and Just said the same thing that there are many elements within programs who will almost stop at nothing to Prevent any sort of of disclosure from from popping out. I know that answer is not great But I actually want to think a little bit harder on giving an exact Reasoning for that question because that's a great question Grush was busted for at least three years. Yes, this is absolutely true interviewing 40 plus people Years of research and data acquisition Um, Colt Hart knows where one is at. Yes, he does I would love to know where that giant thing is buried. I would love to know but I understand why he can't talk about it I'm very excited for imminent. I have a Copy pre-ordered. I'm really excited to to read it really looking forward and anything Dolan puts out I think we can all agree Dolan's one of the best of the best anything Dolan puts out is is so worth reading Jeff if we've known that nha exists. We have acquired in reverse engineered off-world technologies for 70 years Why would we be wasting billions looking for microbes on mars or searching for exoplanets? This is assuming that uh various agencies like nasa the the the main components are aware of reverse engineering programs if you go by some of the The discussions that have been talked about these programs are so sequestered away and compartmentalized Very very very very few people kind of under understand what's going on um, and that would kind of be uh, my realm of thought Is that if technology has been successfully reverse engineered? It's not like your mission directors at nasa or or funders on congressional staff for nasa are exactly aware of kind of what's going on I think the uap updates are like waiting Give me elder sorals elder scroll six, please Please because starfield uh was not great Have I seen the infographic show about the strange encounters? Yes or or uh not on Big foot stuff or squash to be honest. I've never really looked into any like cryptid stuff My mind has always been on uap. However. I think I've watched uh, of course everybody knows the the youtuber wendig you And I think I've watched this uh cryptid iceberg a few times and of course that's great, but I've never actually done any Uh serious research into that That's not my uh, that's not my realm of of of study Put a lot of weight work. The weight has always been I appreciate that. Uh, hopefully to to stay on that path everything that I put out will have research and um Ashing behind it Yes, actually I will do something on this. I know I'm a bit late the kona blue Deserves one of those dives where we go in line by line, especially just because it's it's such an interesting, um Program proposal and how it relates to big low aerospace and so forth How do I ask question? Amog you can just um You can just write it out here and Yeah, you just did. Yeah, just say anything and I will respond Conden report us condyne. Thank you. Yeah, I I get flak all the time, but I I can't pronounce most words it's just because uh I don't really know how to talk Ecology, welcome. Welcome very much Respect your that's a cute guinea pig bgj and ma martial arts. Thank you very much. You're a cool, dude. Um Back in dc. I'd like to go to dc. Of course, there's so many people out there. I'd like to talk to um And just meet with so if I ever am I'll let you know The vatican knows something they have history locked away, which means maybe it's for a good reason Yeah, if you go by grush speaking about the 1933 magenta case information upon the crash uap was back channeled to the us by pope I can't remember but by the sitting pope at the time um The best way to de-stigmatize is just to have conversations about what people think on the topic I often just mentioned how our government is crafting legislation. I think that's a great point. Yes Talked to the 2023 2024 and ea a Um just these sort of conversations where you know people immediately want to jump to aliens and craft or ufo's real Just kind of slowing down and say hey wait. These are the facts so far I think that's really important land and I think that's a great point The powers that be are making panic moves. I sure as heck hope The panic moves if they are doing it aren't too uh jarring because that could lead to some danger When you see one at under 24 feet, you don't need oh tell tell me about that experience I'd love to hear that that sounds like an as close of an enclosed encounter as you can get I've had many people come forward about something they've heard or read about the topic Yeah, yeah kind of once people understand that you take this topic seriously and once they can understand They don't really have to be embarrassed most people will will tell you a story they had like I had a guy at Jiu Jitsu this was a couple weeks ago once he found out about my channel he came up to me He said you know what I like I was biking in new york back in the early 90s And a huge triangle flew over my dad and the uh, so it's just really interesting the the stories these people tell Phone cameras i'm not so sure about that if phone cameras don't seem to be too good at capturing much The dolce base is real or disinfo that is a really good question. I'm not so I'm not sure It seems like there's a little bit too much known about uh, dolce You know there seems to be a bit too much publicly available. I'm trying to remember the uh, the ufo highway ebook by Crap what's his name? I can't remember but who interviews colonel x who talks about everything in dolce Maybe dolce is a red herring. Who knows? Uh, it's It's a tough question. I sir. I don't have enough Knowledge on dolce to have a really informed opinion No, I think birdie asked this too last time with tim taylor. No, it is not Unless you have the phone. Yeah, that's true. Okay, uh Road pirate films custodian file is a channel on youtube He posts videos and records from cameras he had on his roof and he often captures videos objects following planes and helicopters Oh, I'd like to check that out. That actually sounds really interesting I'd like to look at that footage. I don't watch uh, too much footage anymore I know that I've covered uh, two footage cases mostly. I just kind of skate documents and And so forth a footage isn't my number one focus right now, but I I would like to To to keep going on that. Sorry. Some sightings are literally five to ten seconds For leaving. Yeah, love twilight zone twilight zone is great, man. If you've watched the original 50s twilight zone fantastic Ben One of the contracts you mentioned loved one thing I wanted to mention is that a lot of the contracts you mentioned may be Availability public to research. Yeah, but the internal investors as SAIC sites took down all those those contracts, but in my video notes I do have secondary public places where you can read about those Contracts. Sorry, I should have said that in the video. I'm sorry, but for each contract that has been taken down I have different links that are still publicly available to look at them Sighting lasted tell me about your setting to pitchforks. I'd love to hear about it If they wanted to invade us they would have done it, uh, so this uh, yeah Not nukes and launching rockets into space Ethan, what do you say brother? Too funny was just watching your precious videos in your live great investigation. Really interesting to see more But I don't know if that's that's fear. I that was I don't know But the Ross coldheart video with that sphere is really interesting. Yeah, I've watched bits and pieces of this This was a really great interview. I'm not familiar with the engaging the phenomenon host But you know, if if anybody is close to him tell him that that was awesome. That was a really great video It was uh, I think that Semivans quote that's making the rounds about the phenomenon the truth to it being indigestible is really interesting There is a new interview with shonkirk patrick from news nation You know, I thought after the steven green street interview that shonkirk patrick wasn't doing more interviews. So Why why is he doing another interview torum and okay I think sk is a trained intelligence officer if he can't get away with plain dumb and intentionally not looking at things He will yeah, what's his what's his quote? Expect me to lie as an intelligence officer. You should expect me to lie to you. I think you said that Have you investigated cold fusion aka low energy nuclear reaction scalar physics? No, I have not I'm currently Right now behind the scenes. I'm trying to uh educate myself a little more on the physics I know that sounds funny coming from an engineer that I don't really understand the physics But I really haven't spent much time uh researching physics of of of this stuff and I'd really like to so I'm trying to educate myself Before I speak too much on a topic. I'm not too educated about no one is above the law. I agree sk was the di DIA during ossa an atyp. Yes, he was What's the best way to support my work right now? Just watch the video share it with your friends Please if you learn something talk to people about it uh people should be Uh discussing this subject because it's so interesting and uh, I hope that over time There's just not as much We we can we can do our part right now to decrease the stigma around this topic. We really can I've seen clips like the three frames that was and I've only seen some stuff scrolling through twitter And and that was uh, that was really interesting. I don't know. I haven't dug into that very much These seven years have started up Any time these last seven years more. Yes more. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. There's kind of been uh This is a period of time where there has been almost uh Irreversible movement in the realm of uap That is the uh, so infiltration by hybrids that is the original work of david Ike right who talks about I think it was him who who originally thought of uh, reptilians and so forth. I I've never Really kind of dug into that topic Uh, what is my favorite ufo k slash whistleblower? whistleblower Um ufo case That's a good question. Uh, uh, let's think my favorite case. Of course, this would be a crash retrieval. Uh, I just think Hmm I'm not going to do a cop out by saying roswell because that's everybody's favorite taste Hmm I really like Just researching and reading about the 1974 cayome mexico case I really like shag harbor. I really really like kexburg. Um Right now let's Favorite case right now at this moment. Let's say kexburg whistleblower Of course, I think in everybody's heart. I've talked about this before I try not to talk about them too much because I'm sort of Blinded by bias because I want to believe him everybody's favorites bob lasar But again, I I don't cover him or ever reference him in terms of like, okay Like this case might be valid because remember bob lasar said this but because I want to believe him so badly growing up What bob said just captured my mind so much but favorite whistleblower of course Probably one that I've covered Who there was some a little bit of controversy around that's not technically a whistleblower that did not want That said that his story was not true from where I found it A little bit I find daniel solter is a documentary called the UFO the greatest story ever denied and it's only short segments I emailed let me check it if you email it to me and I missed it. I'm sorry about that I'm pretty behind on email. So I will get to that Much love from norway keep up the good work. Hey, thanks, man. I was just in norway last september I went to jevick and oslo. I love norway mj-12 is interesting ryanwood has yes, yes, right? This is why ryanwood is the person i'm going to meet with on this because ryanwood is the best person I know about mj-12 In my recent video when I talked about the non terrestrial science and technology the committee on that I immediately reached out to ryanwood And i'm going to be discussing with that with him more when I get back from japan i'm going to be meeting with him So i'm really looking forward to that What are the thoughts that we talked about this a little bit before and make sure you 70 I think I'll probably stay clear of that For now just because of the the drama and stuff around that one thing I hope I hope you guys know for me It's I really don't want to get interested in like Like social media drama. I don't like that There's no grounded. There's thousands of ny hi stories around the world if just one is true. Yes, there are thousands um Back a while ago some guys at jujitsu brought up that heat map Of ufo sightings and pointed to the fact that the us was the most populated region even though it was a us study that generated this heat map of The coagulated ufo sightings and so forth and all you have to do is look at the hundreds of if not thousands of stories from All around the world. There are so many rich stories. I'm hoping when i'm in japan I can talk to some kind of local people of I can't speak japanese But if some people speak good english ask them about local ufo stories Pentagon still hasn't really passed an audit by the previous gao standards. I researched that a while back Anything else? Yeah, this is a great a great point I'd probably recommend to anybody just some take some breaks have some hobbies outside of uap Watch some good movies watch some science fiction watch some interstellar Watch the expanse Just be able to chill out for a little bit. I know that's important for me at least What would some people are talking about saps disclosing we have people all throughout space literally a breakaway society? Yeah, that's a that's a really interesting Concept the the idea of the the kind of breakaway society as people reference to the reverse engineering programs That's a lot too Lot to explore sorry I got caught up with this profile picture not the name my family Does support me my mom's the best she always watches my videos and wants to talk about the cases so she's great Come up to kexburg, you know what? I actually would like to when I cover kexburg. That's actually a good idea. I would like to try and get boots on the ground Uh, that actually I'd like to do that more. That'd be uh, great. I'd like to do that a lot. Zach. What's up, brother? Any videos you think could be legit ufo's england from 98? I'm trying to think about that So I use this a lot in my b-roll footage One of my favorite sightings there's two sighting here It's not the green triangle from tom DeLonge But it's that individual's triangle sighting of the three-pointed triangle with the the red circle in the middle That takes off at very fast speeds. I haven't done a full analysis on that but I Really really really love that footage. I'm still I'm still kind of uh back and forth on both fly by and The metapod I think the metapod might have a little more credence, but those still I'm still kind of trying to uh Trying to think through a little bit. All right Salvador paiz looks familiar and I may have worked with him in the power and propulsion division at navair packs river Holy cow If you were working at packs river in the propulsion and power division you very well may have that is really interesting Uh, if you remember anything about him, let's talk. I'd love to hear about uh paiz Let's all head out to skinwalker ranch and eat a bunch of mushrooms That all sounds fun and dandy until the filming crew kicks us off the land Ryan thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. We will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure Caught a yes. I hope so that that is going to be one of my uh greatest missions to try and do Are there any associations between weather and UFO sightings? I actually I actually if I'll be honest I have no idea. I really don't um, that's a that's a good question to ask if there's any variable weather padding patterns and mass sightings and so forth I I do not know Uh, what are your thoughts on the coast to coast am interview with victor alleged? as foreworker who smuggled footage out of the alien interview tape, uh, I know that there's a lot of Discussion around that. I think it's that's uh, john stewart That's uh, john's the case. John stewart is working on is it not um I There was a weird connection between that and calahari I read today In terms of in like file notes for referencing calahari I am not quite sure. I haven't spent too much time. I know there's a lot of controversy around the video But somebody recently was like doing an analysis where they inverted colors to track like pupil Tracking on the supposed bean. It's it is that is uh, that's really interesting So I would I will do a little bit more studying and kind of get back Crade thank you. Thank you, man. I appreciate that and I'm sorry my answer to your question about Why I do not think that good guys first bad guys is misinformation I'm actually gonna I'll do a community post about that in the future because that's such a good question Golden is dolin is the gold standard. I completely agree. Uh, dolin and colt heart and lenard lenard string field are my inspirations Especially lenard string field that man's a legend. If you haven't read crash retrieval, uh one through seven I highly recommend it. Leonard string field is an amazing individual Why do you think he hasn't spoken recently? I do think what grush is doing is work behind the scenes I'm not sure how much he can contribute to to a public discourse right now unless there's more senate hearings I'm not sure what else he can say publicly Uh to pass dopser that hasn't already been said, but of course. I don't know grush Uh, but I would like to know what do you mean pitchfork? Everything you said is a lie john s My man, thank you for watching brother. I appreciate that. I agree with starfield. Yeah, I played a little bit of it and it kind of Stunk 2017 prey. No, I really want to play that. Uh, if any of you guys here play games Let me hear what you play. I love I love me some games. Um, so I would like to play Starfield I'm sorry. Sorry. I mean prey I heard recently Pine gap is a pretty decent location if you go to greer's dpi archive And search and look at pine pine gap documents I think he has two witnesses talk about pine gap and a facility there I've also heard from some other individuals that pine gap might be the location there There was some interesting stuff around a korea location But I also talked to a guy who was pretty familiar with kind of fai and fight transponders and stuff And he kind of talked about the purpose of that facility and He said that uh, that korea location may not exactly be it Looking cut. I appreciate that man. It's just the lighting. I'm a bit of a I'm a bit of a jelly roll right now I do that so I can smash people in jujitsu Path of exile a couple of my buddies play that they say it's great. I might have to Speaking on behalf. Thank you for watching. I really appreciate that guys This is all governments do is lie and then shame me for questioning them You go. Yeah, I mean, uh, in many respects governments don't really have the the public's best interest in mind I'm still waiting on some quality alien video They are here looks cool to have atmosphere, but it'd be awesome to see something ground based on the current knowledge and culture Yeah, I'd love I'd also love, um if we could ever get access to the, um satellite images that both grush and melin have discussed Uh high quality satellite images showing uap You're great to be an interview with a grush and alizano. That would be Absolutely, that'd be a classic that'd be an absolute classic. I'd love to see alizano talk more Huge fan of his interviews with kerch. I'm mongolo on the theory of everything. Those are absolutely fantastic If you haven't watched those I highly recommended and if you haven't watched, uh, David grush's jre appearance I highly recommend that too. I watched it, uh Thursday for like the fifth time I actually have some problems with joe on that interview if i'm being honest Joe really kind of worships the ground guys like bob lasar and travis walton walk on right He always talks about bob lasar and his credentials But he kind of was acting a little bit negative towards grush, which was really interesting to me. Um You know I I just I didn't really like how joe handled that interview I just might brother. Thank you Toby I appreciate that. Um I would like to Uh, I would like to try and stream like once a week That would actually be really fun. I'd like to do that. Are there links between her era and r.a. No, there are not If you talk about danger like the u.s. Military is I mean the I hope not man. I'm not Like the u.s. Military. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a point U.p. Show up in ir. That's why regular cameras don't capture them. Yeah, I've heard this too. I I can't remember. What's that gentleman who? showed up at the um He showed up at the sci conference I can't remember but he's starting like a startup to track uap with various systems I I can't remember this young man's name, but he's seen his work seems really Promising toby. I talked about that a little bit earlier. I talked about uh the interesting aspects about The the insider and that this case is difficult or I don't won't talk about it too publicly too much anymore just because I like It's difficult to talk about this case without referencing kind of like the the evidence and so forth Joey has talked about about this insider and so forth But as I mentioned earlier, I was able to also kind of analyze this insider or find out about this individual in a roundabout way I've seen two ufo one in texas one in houston. Tell me about him and I'd love to hear with it I agree with watching much footage, but user five posted and read it in youtube some extremely compelling videos using the thermal camera I'll check that out. I I would I of course love watching footage. I just don't um I don't I just don't uh like Focus too much on it, but yeah, I'll absolutely watch hackology. I'm an active mod of many subs due to my interest I would love to send you my sightings. Yes, please um uap girl about gmail.com. I'll be spending a lot of time kind of looking at Uh, kind of catching up with emails on my flight to japan Are there con? Are the contracts classified from government sites? I do not know the government sites would probably won't hear about the contracts Jimmy, thank you very much. I really appreciate that and that's a really cool sushi shu. I um, thank you so much really They're here and they take whatever animal person that they have invaded long ago, so I think it was colm kelleher that stated I'd like to know what you think about this. I think it was colm kelleher that touched on the cattle mutilation and said that he his personal hypothesis was that There was some sort of agency detecting detecting like preons and local prions preons. I don't know. Okay. I'm sorry. I can speak in local cow population What do you think about that? You've seen the ner off website. Yes, I don't maybe not the a new version. I don't know. I could have checked that out, man um There's a government site of all If there is a government site, I actually haven't found it. I usually find contracts on private company Their various investor websites, so if there is I actually need to find that We I ever make a video on the disclosure act 2.0. I probably will not and here's why Actually, I haven't covered the original disclosure act. There's only minor differences in the disclosure act 2.0 the same numerous references to non-human intelligence legacy programs crash materials the 1954 atomic energy agreement classifying uap material as clans Trans classified for a nuclear material And that is how much of this has not been disclosed because anything that's new nuclear secrets doesn't really need to be disclosed So maybe I will just because I haven't even talked about the first act in general And at the point where see their breakaway civilization that are group keeping the locked away for good reason um yeah I understand the um I don't I struggle with the good reason. I think back to the original news nation interview with ross colthardt And grush said one of the reasons for this being kept secret was feudalistic dominance. Uh, I can't think of a good reason behind that What are your thoughts on ai? Being a part of the phenomenon. Um, I'm thinking back to section five behavioral analysis from the flyby footage from that a leak that occurred on I think it was 4chan that I Still don't have really a place for um that talked about basically some craft being sort of an advanced model of of uh ai I don't know. Um Grush had some interesting things to talk about ai on jre too and and especially his worries of of using ai offensively in in uh adversarial systems basically dropping the ai expecting it to perform but then kind of not really having uh, Not really having hackology. I just got your email. Thank you But not really having a way to kind of control the ai. So ai is rather frightening Uh, how it relates to the phenomenon. I'm not quite sure but I uh, I don't know Have it dig into silicon-based life like is suggested. Yes, there is a great youtube I watched a really good youtube documentary on silicon-based life And there is a really good like a graphics-esque, uh youtube channel. I I can't remember Heck, what is the name? I'll find it. No, I'll plug it. But yes, I have silicon-based life is extremely interesting Um So what are your thoughts on the lani's amora case? Yes, I would love to cover more of the classic cases. Uh, currently I'm looking at interesting parallels between the lani's amora case craft and the calahari desert south africa in 1989 alleged crash retrieval if you look through some of the uh, Military documents alleged military documents that were recreated discussing the 1989 craft the crash had similar Symbology from the lani's amora case So I do want to cover that because now I'm I'm really interested in kind of that symbology and so forth and trying to understand that Abductions, what do I think about uh, Stephen Greer to evil humans being michael akino the leader of this set temple Greer is a bit of an enigma to me if I'm being honest I'm not quite sure about so many of his motives and it's weird because so much of his research is brilliant And then so much of what greer has done post You know a certain date wherever we can find he started to do some some interesting stuff Abduction cases are really interesting. I kind of mentioned earlier one of my first ever cases. I read about was betty and barney hill um So and of course, I know travis walton many of the famous cases They're really interesting. I don't know what to make of them to be honest. Um I what interests me is the intent behind abduction, so I would want to uh, I would really kind of want to backtrack and Try to find context around the abduction and try to determine motives as to why this happens But abductions are really interesting and they're extremely frightening To think of if you guys have seen fire in the sky, I know it's a dramatization about travis walton's case The scene where travis walton is uh, basically experimented on fire in the sky came out in 93 is terrifying I believe bob, let me know what you guys think about, uh, lasar, of course lasar is such an interesting case Hopefully we can get to the bottom of his case Again, like what I said is he's tough for me to talk about because I am just so biased in towards bob I want to believe him so bad. So it's hard for me to take an objective lens because you know I'll see problems with bob sesame. I'll say yeah, well, maybe this because I I want to believe him so darn bad Toby, thank you very much. Uh, I I'm trying to get through everything. I'm sorry if I'm slow guys. I know I can ramble Do you think consciousness is tied to the you I've heard that maybe these vehicles could be controlled with consciousness And so can you elaborate on how you view consciousness? A while ago if you asked me I probably would have said no, but over time more and more cases I follow There's more and more kind of link between human cognition human consciousness and UAP some of the claims that vehicles can be controlled with consciousness Of course, you have Michael talking about p Michael Herrera talking about p3's but also backtracking a little bit You have uh, ross colt heart talking about kind of consciousness interface with controlling craft You also have the infographics whistleblower fees to be real That retrieval teams need to have basically grounding mechanisms. So their brain isn't distorted by the phenomenon You have Gary Nolan. You have Jacques Valet. You have Lou Elizondo who's discussed this and you have many more who have talked about issues with cognition and various problems that occur with the human mind encountering UAP um So at this point, I do think there is a link between consciousness and cognition and UAP what it is I don't know. I really don't know and I'd love to find out because remember i'm coming from a realm A science realm where you think of of synapses and stuff in in the driving cause between the human brain But more and more I studied this phenomenon the more and more there's a strange link between these Hey, griff, when's the next iceberg episode? Would you guys like another iceberg episode? I don't want to like The thing is I don't want anybody to be disappointed when I put out a release um I would love to make more iceberg because it's kind of fun to put a little bit more human a little bit more Or a humor a little bit more of a personal spin on stuff But if you guys don't like the icebergs, I won't do it. But if you guys want to see some icebergs, I'll do it I also Maybe I'll wait till 10k. I'm going to do the taxonomy from carl nels deleted slide Just talking about every single possible origin of nhi so Uh apek arts parts and analysis and their thruster experiments. I have not ch, but that sounds really good. I'm gonna write that down Thank you guys if whenever people Put stuff out like this for me to look at I really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart Uh If you had to estimate the amount of people who have been part of a crash retrieval reverse engineering team What do you think the number is? This is total guess, but I'd say relatively small like In history maybe below 500 In my guess you ate your crash retrieval teams the personnel on them are probably highly highly highly specialized and if you look at Remember recently I mentioned that uh christopher sharp article about the oga and jsoc Joint special forces operations command if some of these crash retrieval operators are jsoc They are highly trained and those don't come a dime a dozen Ecology mj-12 fifth annual review uh written I need to look at the if was that written by ryanwood I gotta look at that Rattle rattle. Thank you so much. We need to support you. Thank you. I appreciate that very much Um, sorry, let me I'm a young richard dolin. I thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Um I he's a true inspiration hunting victor the documentary tell me i'ma write that down I will download that and watch that on the plane I Play minecraft minecraft is great bro. Everybody loves minecraft Wow, I would love to play wow, although I think I would lose my holy cow. Are we just getting to the the games? I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. Uh I'm sorry. Uh, I'm taking so slow a lot of people have called greer grifter neglecting the important work. Yes I agree. This is why I talk In almost every video about the 2001 disclosure briefing document I think that piece of literature is brilliant and a must read if you haven't I highly highly highly recommend it It's fantastic Have you ever read inside flying objects by michael p masters? No, I haven't but michael p masters is really interesting I'd like to uh, I'd like to get into a bit more of his work You are a beast bjj and i give you those guns. No, I just lift a lot of weight. Thank you What are your thoughts on steven greer? It seems like uh Ever hey, do you want so I've talked about greer a lot Uh, I have mixed feelings on greer because I don't like how he charges thousands of dollars for ce5 And I don't like how he self-aggrandizes himself in his witness stories A good example of this is michael herera's case when michael herera discusses That he was held at gunpoint by these men the black operators When he observed the ufo greer likes to take it a step further by saying that he was made to turn around and get on his knees Uh, basically thinking he's gonna get shot in the back of the head So greer likes to kind of control these witnesses a little bit It seems and kind of aggrandize the stories when it makes a little sense to make them seem a little bit more sensational Sensational however at the same time Stephen greer has done exceptional work for ufology exceptional work 2001 disclosure briefing document is a fantastic piece. I so recommend reading that the greer witness list I talk about this every time I reference the subject these people need to be separated from greer himself Okay, just because they're contacting greer their case a lot of people say oh like he's in contact with greer We shouldn't look at his case. No these individuals deserve to be analyzed just as much as anybody else Some of the work greer has done is excellent. There's a top line summary in the disclosure briefing document that talks about the program back in 2001 I I find it and I'll post it, but it's fantastic. I'll actually do a community post on it. Um What are your thoughts on ai as an aspect we talked about that a little bit have I watched professor simon holland's I've heard of professor simon holland, but not orford ness. I will actually get into that a little more um Once a spook always a spook and I remove that comment with the word line. Yeah, once a spook always a spook Hey, man, really enjoy your detail oriented videos remind me of think anomalous who covers some of these cases when he sometimes includes details Other researchers overlook. Thank you very much. I really appreciate those kind words He's in project gravitar with little zars input coming out this year s4 recreated in vr in crazy detail. Yeah um, I know on the project gravitar website or kind of some of their promotional material They have screenshots from the craft and that's really interesting. Also mac mayve studios has a great video inside Inside area 51 and s4. I've used some b-roll footage for that I'd really like to collaborate with that dude because he makes some awesome stuff. But yeah, check that out. That's great Greetings from chile. What's up, brother? Thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words Trying to give you money. It's okay, man. Well, thank you for having me on patreon. But I Thank you so much day after raswell is core. So yeah, I'm sorry. I was looking at that. I think the raswell incident That's bill more come to think of it Game recommendations. You can never go wrong with doom 2016 Doom plus doom eternal. Yeah, the doom games are fantastic to zealot. I hope you're still here God of war ragnarok is fantastic as well. I can't wait for that new doom game Games games. I'm trying to think is no games have really caught my attention too much lately I'm gonna replay ghosts of sushi ma if you haven't played that that's an excellent game. I can't wait UAP humanoid encounters coming out of peru. No, but I know that ross coldheart just did a video on that Those are pretty interesting. They talk about beings that like melt people's faces off Of course, I can't discount anything. I just haven't done enough research to have a very informed opinion It's very interesting though. And I'd like to listen to that reality check episode that talks about this Um, what are your thoughts on the nascar mummies? I post this website last time because I talked about it on a recent video You should check out the 3d scans of all the mummies You can kind of go through the the different layering of them. It's super interesting And guys in about 15 minutes. I'll have to hop off. So I'm going to get through everything because I got a pack I haven't I haven't packed um Huckology. Yes, I have and I will post that as well. What do you think about pyramids in Alaska? It's one of the price locations remote view prior to his death uh, the remote viewing is Yeah, Alaska is a very mysterious land. I've heard of a possible reverse engineering locations in Alaska as well I think Alaska is a very mysterious land. I Don't know. I don't know maybe remnants of an ancient civilization in Alaska. I don't know I do not know but that's a good question fat rodents. Thank you so much watching this with buddies We'll tell your slimes as the kids say I say hi getting money. Thanks. Hopefully. Thank you very much. I appreciate that Got a jet Well, you probably signed off but have a great night, bro I'm sure that you've seen yes, I have seen the beaver utah footage It's pretty interesting, but I haven't given it a full analysis like I I don't want to just say like I think this or this without uh, really thoroughly looking at something. Um, but you know, I will take a take a harder look Listen, you know, actually that would be kind of fun if any of you guys want to kind of get together and play some games together I'd love to do that. Colm said there seemed like there were two groups. One had the laser tech trying to go through Uh, imitate mutilations. I had not heard that. Thank you for clearing that up I've got to look into that as well. Say get employee. What is your day job? I am an engineer. I do mostly qa Engineering these days and it's very boring If you see any clear ufo company, yes, uh, jennanette is fantastic Someone sent me one of his videos, uh, recently and they're really great. I would highly recommend But have you blocked s but he's on mj 12. It's really good No, I have not No, I will read that. Thank you Finally caught alive is the ufo news dying out. No, I do not the mall incident. No, I do not think so I think with the 2024 I think after congress recesses in august as this issue is voted on We'll see a lot more interesting things and I think with lulis ando's book coming out We'll see a lot of interesting things Ethan Simmons. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Enjoy japan. I'll see what other data. Thank you very much I will use this money to feed myself some delicious sushi. Thank you so much Uh, let me I'm trying to go fast guys. I'm sorry. I'm so slow. No sweat Why would these uap let themselves be seen? I don't know attributing motives to the phenomenon if you've read jock valet's book dimensions and passport to magnolia it seems like sometimes the uh It seems like sometimes the uap either want themselves to be seen once it disguised themselves as other things or so forth Attributing motives and understanding. I really don't have any idea. I really don't I'd like to understand more What about the young guy's tracking, uh, ronnie vernet? No, he was just with reality check yet No, the the young man. I who is tracking you a photo or Uap with his equipment. That's not him. I just can't remember what his name is Uh, you on reddit should have posted a live chat. That's all right, man. AJ green. That's the famous Excellent bangles player. Good name. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yes I will be covering the maje brazil crash and I will hopefully be able to be using mac maves studios footage on that absolutely uh No, I cannot The um first australian's triangle shaped constellation a group of triangle shaped. Okay Basically, so three stars in the triangle formation. Did they move at all in the formation or did it stay pretty uniform? um One sec. Sorry guys. I'm getting a call I Sorry guys My bad. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to skip over that UAP being controlled mostly by a mic's perfect sense also the craft piloted by actual biologic nhi It was heavily declines the 60 70s and 80s nowadays nowadays mostly ai So yeah, that that kind of boils down to like the von neumann self replicating probe, right? I talked about that in the infographic show. That's a pretty interesting uh idea john michael godier Who's a great he has a great youtube channel who talks a lot about kind of uh Fermi paradox extraterrestrial intelligence and so forth talks often about how von neumann probe is a very applicable solution to uh spreading the civilization basically and into its own galaxy without violating faster than light travel and so forth so the the some Many uap being controlled by ai does make sense if we think to that infographics video I think it's just like the basically the uh saucers and possibly triangles that are piloted such things as bells Spheres and so forth are are mostly drones Capital s pattern. Oh that is interesting It is always it is extremely interesting when you see something In the sky that is exhibiting flight patterns that you when you start to notice one of the five or six observables of uap And assigning this super interesting One of the best since it made up the story to get out of it. I've heard that too and if that's the case those men are some of the smartest people alive to make up a uap abduction story to get out of a contract I believe bob and there's a lot of things that were corroborated, but only is the education thing Yeah, I think the education thing is a little too uh Played out a little people focus on that too much. Of course, it's a valuable thing to use To kind of talk against bob, but people bring that up too much. I believe Uh You have one of those signed too. Yeah, that's what you can't see here is the the reactor Uh, and how the the sports model works too. This is just an excellent piece psionics. Yes Lazar is definitely a friday can email you all the proof study tis and type please please uap gur about uh gmail.com if you're still here, man I I would like to to read that a lot They can mess with our brains experiences Correct stan freeman didn't like lasar. Yes Yes, or stan freeman did talk against lasar quite a bit. I'm getting to the iceberg stuff Okay, a lot of people are interested in the the iceberg. So yeah, I will um, I will get to that a little bit So, okay. Yeah, tommy. We talked a little bit about the face peelers uh So if you're interested in jsoc look into the the squadron the 24th st. Yeah Yes, there was somebody on reddit recently like a supposed whistleblower case somebody in the 24th sts who talked about his captain Who was pulled away for very specific duties? Occasionally and one time he talked about seeing some sort of craft that he said wasn't ours and was very shook from it That's a really interesting story. I believe I have that downloaded if anybody wants me to share it with them Cracker jack, thank you very much friends have different monies. Thank you very much I really appreciate your support on the bottom of my heart How many things see uh, see fives or a thing? It's just I don't know. I need mods. I I'd like mods, especially as kind of the channel grows for this stuff but you know, the thing is like Everybody who types here is either wanting to talk to each other or talk to me And I feel like I'm doing people a disservice if I'm just having somebody else filter out what they're saying like if you're typing out a Message specifically to say something to me You know, you are supporting this channel and I owe it to you to look at what you are saying and respond and think about it so mods Mods be damned for the time moment. Um I think that was our brain wash similar to benowitz. That's interesting Uh, see over yeah, I I'd like to the gentleman who said he would talk to um Or send me that information about lasar. I'd like to look at that as well. Greer is clearly a narcissist I thought you said gerb for a second man. I was like, what the heck? But yes, I agree gerb rules you roll telekinesis beats You're truly a young dolin. Thank you so much. Greer was an only option for many witnesses. This is an excellent point I'm sorry for getting to this late. Greer is has been for many people the only option Can I link to the greer briefing document? Yes, I can I'll make a community post on it. Okay Posted on reddit. Thank you very Yes, I've thought about this too. Um lasar after the congressional hearings did uh, I told you so but he hasn't testified The heineck ufo report is excellent Uh, the cia ufo paper is also excellent. I have not heard or I've not read ufo's generals pilots and government officials I absolutely will I've linked to the ufo report and the cia ufo papers in a couple videos So if anybody's interesting those I will watch it The uh, okay hunting victor not out yet. Okay, but I will watch it when it comes out. I didn't know uh, Or jog flay. Yeah, I has also mentioned that bob that he had to whoa Green okay. Yeah, I need to study up a little bit on on that more because that's a pretty interesting theory NASCAR mummies He says slimes Yeah, dude. I I'm still I still try to try to uh, not act not act too old Do you have any really good uap videos? We might have seen I talked about this before but one of the videos I think like lives in my head rent free is the video of the black triangle I include a minute much of my b-roll footage Check it out in my locky martin video It's a footage from a handheld camera of a man taking a video of a black triangle in his backyard that exhibits four lights One light at each vertices of the triangle and one Uh, uh red light middle it takes off at a high speed at the end of the video I don't know if that video is real or not. I'm not advocating for its credibility, but it's really interesting What's up with the phoenix lights? fantastic case uh the Conventional explanation is the a10 warthog flares, right? But then uh pipe or What's the dude? What's the governor's name who came out and said he Was disappointed and how he reacted and coming on stage with an alien suit talking about the phoenix lights The phoenix lights is one of the most interesting cases we have in the public domain in my opinion What do you think about the four-chan whistleblowing that claims about ufo's? Yeah, so he talks about ufo's being made like a or respect per purpose that Four-chan whistleblower is insanely interesting and I will Still cover that full thing at some point because I love that that story. It's just really interesting Mods are not a good policy. Oh, oh, thank you. Tommy. I appreciate that brother mods are not a good freedom Yeah, that's the thing too like I really don't want some uh random person kind of telling people what they can and can't say uh You know, I don't want that howdy from lumberton texas. What's up, man? Thank you very much for joining in vegetable gremlin It it can feel like that. Yeah, uh UAP feels like it never ending circus. I I empathize with that and I understand That's why I think it's so important to kind of pick and choose what you're studying at once You know, you see with a lot of questions people ask me I'll be pretty outright and say I have no idea what I think on the topic because I haven't studied it In this field spreading yourself too thin is a massive detriment. It's really a massive detriment. So focusing on what you like to specialize in researching that branching out occasionally but really trying to focus in on something you can make really good progress My specialty what I like crash retrievals reverse engineering and speaking to witnesses First-hand witnesses that is what I like. There's so much more in this domain outside of that But I'm spreading myself too thin and probably being a little bit demoralized if I were to do that because I can't focus on as much I have a playlist If you look over it help you navigate the electromagnetic. Yes, please please please please send that to me uapgrub at gmail.com Please I I'd love to review that on my flight It's a great time to be alive might And also it yeah, it is this is what an interesting time to be alive Aquedia. Yeah aquedia Peru Uh, I'm trying to think why can't I remember what case aquedia Peru is I've referenced it before but my mind is given a blank A deep dive in a deep dive on if s4 was real I was went to the black at the idea that the bus would be 30 knots on hook Uh, so one of the best I want to do a deep dive on s4 and I have a fantastic document I want to reference for that It is the project Aquarius document that talks about dan barish and gives a detailed layout of all seven layers of s4 And I do want to cover that I've been yes, um tenkai, please I I'd really like to read your research 5th simington. Yes, that's the names 4chan story seems to check out Uh, yeah, when he talks about the spheres in that he talks about them being like a hammer design, right? So uh Keep reading it. Okay. I've seen uap I've seen uap once at night three lights flying around rapid speed coming to an instant stop okay That is that is a very interesting case So you saw three lights flying out of rapid speed Coming to an instant stop Changing colors and intensity and jumping like a mild and instant instantly continue done its previous path That is extremely anomalous Uh, oh I'm with the okay Puerto Rico. Yes, that is the case where there's uh, yes. Yes, okay I know what you're talking about. That's the 2000. I think 18 footage Where the uap is shown hovering over the town goes into water splits into two and rises Uh tanner johnson. What's up brother? Yes, we are doing alive How did you become interested in the ufo topic? I think it's just the way my brain works ever since I could read one of my first ever books was on the Betty and Barney hill abduction. I've been fascinated with the story since ever I Since I could read since I knew how to think I have always been obsessed with ufos But until I reached my recent age, I didn't really know how to express that, right? and I finally came to a point in my life where I realized I has something to offer in terms of treating the subject like I would a research paper in engineering having a thesis Having a body of work having a body of references and making that into a video trying to make it entertaining that people could watch Try and limit as much of my personal interest in in each video in each research project as much as possible and just deliver the data The facts the surrounding context on a topic. So this is just such an important topic for me. Do I believe dan barish is legitimate? I don't know because I haven't done the um that dive yet And I do know some interesting people who actually have no opinion on dan barish, which is interesting Of course, he talks about j rod. He talks about uh j rod who uh bill u house talks about being retreated from the Kingman crash the thing is with dan barish. He talks about two j rods He talks about j rod uh ebe 5 3 az which is the kingman arizona j rod. No j rod two were recovered there He says one was handed off to los alamos national labs one was given to Uh, what's s4? He talks that that is a p 52, you know p 45 p 45 species and there's p 52 a riot species So I need to do a deep dive because he's really interesting. I know the the youtube channel night shift did recently So I'll probably wait a little bit um To let that all that die down and do like a full uh full research project. So you observed, um An instantaneous deceleration and acceleration. That is fascinating jimmy carter's ufo report. Yes jimmy carter is really so, um jimmy carter, of course Was an advocate for uap and danie sheehan has stated he performed uap investigation for jimmy carter because of his interest Can you try and vet? Yes, absolutely. I will do that. Um, I'll do a I will do a full research project on his claims Uh, his the project Aquarius and so forth because that that seems like a really interesting thing to explore op tv Um, thank you very much. I really appreciate that Do you know anyone approaching the uap subject from the instrumentation detection angle There's your channel is launching model rockets into the anomalous phenomenon launching rocket. Yeah, I don't think I don't think that's a good idea Yeah, there's that gentleman who's actually building really interesting detection software. I will find his name and I'll post about him I'm sorry. I can't remember right now, but he is the guy right now um That's a yeah, that's the thing it with many sightings they last so briefly You don't have time to get it on any filming mechanisms Mods for time management. Obviously someone we will see we will see as we as we grow we might have more people chatting The looking glass technology is really interesting. If you guys don't know what that is a danbury's claim But I think level four or five and s4. There is some sort of uh, like time manipulation project called project looking glass at s4 I'm always wary of involving ebe's living amongst human. Yes. I I am too. I always just Taking them stepping back. Yes, uh, uh, northrop who kind of talked to I think it was I know the video of him in a garden in which he discusses uap openly And that is a very interesting video and when I eventually one day make a video about northrop grum and I will be referencing that Uh, dude exchanging aliens isn't like human trafficking except with a Yeah, it's yeah, exactly. Yeah, if danbury's is telling the truth, they're just swapping ali or et's like yugioh cards You watching for recent. I have not if there are recent metapod videos. Please Please show me if you guys think I'm just kind of lacking on that stuff. It's not I'm just so focused on a few aspects Crafts retrieval reverse engineering and talking to people golden domes. Yes, I will be talking about this golden domes from danie shihan If you guys don't know danie shihan has claimed that there's golden dome What's known as golden dome and the cias technology used to detect uap even when they're cloaked Thanks for the q&amp;a. Hey, good night, brother. Good night, man. Good night from church. Nice, man. Have a great night Agree on the looking glass comment research. Okay guys. I will uh finish up these comments. Then I got to hit the road That's all right. I got a pack. I agree yeah, so Yeah, and this sort they're with danbury's there's so much to unpack it deserves a a lot of research Yes, golden domes. We will absolutely be talking about that in the future It was like a beacon going off on earth. They split the adamant. Yeah, that's a that's a great thing to talk about right like a Huge influx of uap sightings post the first atomic bomb drop. I am of the mind I do think there's been a presence on this phenomena for quite a long time Uh, how long that is I don't know but I think the If we may have lit up like a beacon with the first atomic bomb dropping I do think there has been a presence on this planet longer Since when do you have an interest in uap's forever? I've talked about this a few times brother But uh, I have had an interest in uap since I could think as a human and it has been one of my biggest passions And it wasn't until recently I learned I could Actually try and do good on this subject Just found your channel via jason juror. Who's jason shardrani if he's showing me out. Thank you, man. I appreciate that Just for the record one sighting in austin ever moved. Okay, gotcha Yes, I will cover the uap da because I never covered the 2023 variation All right, I'll get through these and then I'm stopping with aj greens coming on iceberg Have you ever looked in the contrail picture that when pull the pull? No, I have not but I will check that out brother What if the reason why uap is so secretive is the nh i themselves don't uh you us Disclose about their existence for whatever reason Yeah, I I mean the the fact that the phenomenon itself isn't revealing itself is telling right? Like they ultimately have the power to disclose themselves or not Maybe they don't trust us. Maybe we are like maybe the zoo hypothesis has some truth to it that mainly we are just a piece of study Thank you. Zach. I appreciate that man. I thank you for all of your comments on pretty much every one of my videos She hands incredible. I uh jesse michaels has an interview coming out with she hand. I cannot wait for that Hope you got a window seat. No man. I got the aisle. Um, but I'll probably have to trade for my girlfriend. So she'll have I'll have a middle Check out that. Yes. Well, unfortunately, I'll just be going to uh, tokyo and kyoto I won't be have time to go to Hiroshima or Nagasaki Fat rodents. Thank you Uh, I built a technology that allows me to send chats and live streams from the past They're super Yeah, what? Okay, uh, other two stars never moved up. That is very interesting They don't like you here. Maybe it's just an uh impartialness to humans, right? Maybe it's just not even Maybe we are to them. What answer to us? Alpha zero. Hey, man. Nice to see you live. Thank you very much But please don't fall into the black hole. Yes a lot of charlots and jokers. We talked about this earlier I'll always do what I can to uh, kind of ground myself and Kind of not fall into Unhealthy habits. Where am I going tokyo and kyoto? I am going to I will be training at kotokan in tokyo For a little bit of judo too. You were born in uh, yukisoka. That's awesome, bro I'm so excited to visit your beautiful country. It's been my top destination forever. And with that guys I am going to hit the road. So I'll I just feel so terrible about not providing content. So I might provide like some Community posts a little bit like articles about stuff Because I would still like to talk about a couple things So thank you guys so much and samuel.

Live. All right. What's up, everybody? What up, Colin from Dubai? How you doing, man? Oh, what up, John? John, Mr. Pico Graham. Hey, tell Jones to stop ducking Aspenall. I'm sick and tired of it. We're going to let some more people filter in. I'm trying to kick a pretty foul mood at the moment. If you guys don't know, I'm a big American football fan and my team, the Cincinnati Bengals, just got smoked to a dreadful team. So we're just going to be, and I spent four and a half hours this morning watching Greer. So it's just been a strange day. Well, we'll get through it. Got a cold brew. What are you guys up to, anyone? Do anything fun this weekend? Got anything going on? Let me adjust my lighting a little bit. And the lecture was really interesting. I have notes on every single aspect of the entire four hours. So we're going to go through it kind of line by line. I have screenshots from the entire thing, and I kind of want to break down each of the PowerPoint slides and tricks in my hand. Any advice for new content creators? I am still a new content creator, and it's just kind of figuring it out as you go. I don't know if there's any answer, man. I still don't know what the heck I'm doing, to be honest. Watching NFL? Yeah. Yeah, let's... I hate the sport. I hate football, but I'll be watching next week. What up, Alexander? How you doing, man? Jones will never fight. I know, and he's ducking him, because John Jones knows he'd get smoked and knocked out in the first. You went to a seven-hour general assembly of a political party. You got in a word, hey, that's awesome, man, for what subject, representing, or... That's really cool. Greetings from Germany. Hey, what's up, man? I've only been to Frankfurt in Germany, and I loved it. Four and a half hours with Greer is enough to sour anyone's day. Well, when we get into it, it'll probably be really interesting to you. The presentation was split up into halves. So the first half of the webinar was talking all about, you know, the program, black programs, black sites that Greer wanted to discuss. And the entire second half was about kind of new age stuff, consciousness, and so forth. But we got all the slides. We'll go through everything. Soon 10K, I hope. So, Gluten, you got the flu, dude? What happened? I feel like you're... This is my friend, Gluten. I feel like you're ill just about every week. So I don't... I hope you're all right. Doing great. Love your deep dives. Thank you. I appreciate that. We got one coming out soon this week, very soon. Hello from Canada. What's up, dude? What part of Canada? Two lives. I did. I promised everybody we'd be doing one live a week. And I intend to keep that promise. Just a general memory till... That's awesome. And you're from Iceland, correct? I love it. Wilder side. What's up, dude? Hello from Dubai. Event Horizon. What's up? If you guys don't know Event Horizon, this is John Michael Goode. And his wonderful producer, Ross, I highly... I mean, I'm sure you guys know about John's channel and the Event Horizon podcast. Both of these men are excellent individuals. And I can't wait to be talking about him more in the future. If you guys don't know Event Horizon, go watch any episode. Any of John Michael Goode's videos on the Fermi Paradox are instant classics. And I highly recommend them. John is a huge inspiration for my channel in terms of just how he treats every video almost like a research paper. It doesn't have any BS, kind of just the facts approach. Not really slick editing to kind of trick people with clickbait or anything like that, but just stick straight to discussing the topic. I love John Michael Goode. All right. Living in Malta near the border, British Columbia. That's awesome. I love it in the private party. That's awesome, man. Congrats. Originally from Arkansas, living in Malta. Oh, thank you so much, Rod. I know you. I really appreciate it. Skip the matinee. What were you seeing? Alien, Beetlejuice. I don't know what else is out at the moment. Event Horizon does rock. John Michael Goode rocks. Absolutely is awesome. 6 a.m. or where are you? Are you in Asia or Hawaii? I was trying to do this one a little bit earlier so we could get some of the EU fellers and especially because this program had to do with London. Thank you, Ross and John. I will talk to you guys soon. I appreciate that, man. Really appreciate it. Have I ever seen Janet's YouTube channel? Very interesting, clear footage of UAPs. I've heard of the channel, but I haven't sat through and watched a ton of the videos. I will have to though. There's just so much to analyze lately without even touching footage. Recently, I talked to John and Ross from Event Horizon. That's something that all of us are on the same page on. A lot of the times, footage is useful or useless for furthering the conversation. Thanks, Ross. I appreciate that, man. Thank you very much. Much love. Thank you for the support. It's awesome. Greetings from the UK. Yes. Okay. Perfect. I wanted some of my friends from across the pond in here. That's wonderful. Can you do a video where you analyze Green Street and other skeptics claims? Absolutely. I'd love to. Green Street is a strange one. There's something that makes me irrationally angry whenever I see a tweet of his because I know it has an 8 out of 10 probability of containing the words alien space monster or spooky aliens or something like that. That sounds great. Green Street, maybe a little bit more Sean Kirkpatrick work, I think would be excellent. Absolutely. Way to kick off the week. Thank you, Django. My mom's dog's name is Django. Nice to see you, new subscriber. Thank you very much, man. I really appreciate that. First video, when you get it, feel free to drop the link. I'd love to watch it. How about we get started with the, yes, Green Street does have DOD ties. He does. Oh, Norway Oslo here, man. I was just in Oslo last September. My girlfriend is Norwegian. I loved it. I can get the link. Yes, please, brother. Let's start with Steven Greer's event. This wasn't nearly as publicized as something like the 2023 National Press Club event. I'm not exactly sure why. I know Greer put a lot of effort into kind of getting a lot of attention towards that. This was done in London. A bit strange as there were different tiers to kind of witness the event. The webinar itself was $50. It was really weird, but there was also a $75 in-person ticket to go see. She know if you're watching that, let me hear how it was. And then you could pay $1,500 for a meet and greet with Steven Greer. Like a dinner because the way the event went from three to seven o'clock London time was Steven Greer's lecture and webinar, he says, and workshop. There was no workshop. There was no worksheets, but this was split into two distinct tabs as I'll kind of get to. After that, there was a dinner with Steven Greer and then a premiere of the lost century, Steven Greer's newest documentary. I think that is free to stream on Peacock maybe or it's free to stream on some service. I recommend watching it. I know it features a lot of artwork by Michael Schrat and I really respect Michael Schrat and love his work. And I still do think any of Greer's work is worth watching and then kind of analyzing and dissecting from there. Let's get through these. Do you think Steven Greer tries to bring forth any actual whistleblowers? In this event, no. He only talks about mostly whistleblowers. We know. In fact, Steven Greer had himself a viewing of a UFO witness list and decided to reiterate some of that. But I think right now he's on the warpath of trying to kind of to identify these black operation sites, two of which he mentioned in the video. And we'll go through those. I'll pull up the exact actually three of them he mentioned in the video. I got exact coordinates to all of them. So we'll kind of go through there and keep going. Gluten, some swag would be legit. I would like that. I'd like to do some black stuff with some just stitched logos on there. It's free on rumble. It's free on rumble. So I recommend watching that. I recommend watching unacknowledged. Just anything by Greer is worth a watch. The production value on his documentaries are generally very high. And it's still good to, yeah, cult leader. A lot of this conference was about CE five. I remember. So for my discord, I had live notes in there just kind of telling everybody what was going on with screenshots and stuff like that. And Greer would go on like 25 minute diatribes talking about like his near death experience at 17 or a lucid dream of the future. And that's fine and dandy, but to spend, you know, a significant amount of time in a workshop where people are paying money to go see. I'm a little bit, uh, I'm a little bit, uh, not huge on that. So let's start. I'm going to share my screen and we'll just kind of go through things a bit slowly as people start to trickle in because there is some really interesting stuff Greer talked about and some interesting connections as well. So I need to remember how the heck to share my screen. Cinema layout presents. Share screen. Tire screen. Okay, cool. Yeah. So let's see what everybody's saying. Um, Greer. Yes. Exactly. Greer should not be ignored, although he is controversial for anyone saying, please try CE five. Uh, you want to understand it? I would like to understand it. I still have not tried CE five. Greer says he has, uh, tutorials on how to do such a thing. But, uh, you know, it's why not explore it and then kind of, uh, come up with a conclusion there. But so some of the things Greer talked about in this was, uh, uh, talking about new top secret witness testimony. He didn't really reference any new top secret testimony. We'll go through everybody he did talk about. You'll know some familiar players from my channel. He references Michael Herrera. He references TB, which I thought was in somewhat of strange taste. He went, uh, mentions MS. Uh, witness, TE or ET. I can't remember in which direction in the disclosure project archives. It's 10, eight, nine, two. The guy who discussed a fake abductions and programmable life forms will kind of touch into, uh, besides that, um, Greer posts two images of blacks. I T visited from last year. Neither of these images he posted are from his actual visit. One of them is from Google Earth. Another one is a ripoff of one of my images, which was kind of funny to see, uh, meetings between Dr. Greer and key members of Congress. We have a couple of notes on that. So let's, um, let's start going through things. So I have, uh, power. I have screenshots of every single slide that Greer had. I'm just going to get all these. We'll go one by one. Sorry. What the heck? My bad guys. Okay. Yeah. So for, uh, Greer's first, he gave a little kind of preamble when he was talking about serious disclosure and so forth. Greer states that his first CE five attempt occurred in 1992 in England at the height of crop circles. Greer claimed that his initial CE five event led to a crop circle that inspired his CE five logo, which is this. So Greer stated that, um, he summoned a UAP craft, eat this crop circle with this design appeared. And then he saw a large saucer like design in a field. That was new to me. I know Greer kind of states that since he was like 18, he even said this in the, uh, presentation that he had kind of figured out how the universe works, which I find a little bit egotistical. I'm not going to lie. Even if a CE five has some real practices to it, I don't think it's very humble to state you understand how the universe works as a 17 year old man. But this is how kind of serious disclosure and so forth came to be. So his initial slide, some of the points he wanted to talk about were, um, he approached this sort of webinar as kind of like a kindergarten level briefing for individuals. He kept saying in the first couple of slides that, you know, whoever watches this, it's going to absolutely blow your mind. Like you're going to be crying when you leave this year. You're not going to really be able to understand what you just saw. And to be honest, there wasn't too much like new information here. There's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss, but there wasn't a lot of really new, um, information. So something that Greer does state on these first couple of slides is when, when he was young, a gatekeeper to the program who tried to kind of not really buy Greer off, but to, um, but intimidated Greer. So Greer said that Major Albert Stubblebine was this individual. Stubblebine has mentioned multiple times in the witness list. So sorry, spell check. So Greer has a witness, 10, 5, 9, 9, who worked with Major Stubblebine for four years, has documents, recording interviews and others to back up his claims. I've found no, none of those documents in the DP archive. Uh, he also taught Greer has a witness, 10192 of an ex remote viewer under Stubblebine, um, and so forth. But here is a really interesting witness guys. Uh, check this out. 610658. I noticed this a lot. I noticed this a lot earlier when I was kind of reading through the DPR. I cried the first time. So Greer has a witness 10658. He says that this witness has been involved in the sixties, former head of Fort Huachuca. I hope I'm saying that right. And if I'm not, I'm sorry. Fort Huachuca, army intelligence where ET craft and body are stored. He says this because later when Greer posts his facility list, he talks about Fort Huachuca being a really kind of key facility. Well guys, now here's what's interesting. Okay. So major Albert Stubblebine Greer says this person intimidated him. Let's go to look at the, um, let's look at the army intelligence center in school at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. So this is the Fort Huachuca who was in charge of, sorry, let me back up for a second. When Greer talks about Fort Huachuca, which we'll address later in the video, he says that the person he spoke to ran a Fort Huachuca and discussed ET craft and ET bodies in the 1970s. Okay. So check this out. Brigadier General Eugene Kelly Jr. took command of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center in school at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. This was in the year 1975. But this is rather interesting. In 1977 at Fort Huachuca, he relinquished his command to General Albert Stubblebine. So Stubblebine could very well be this witness right here, 10658, somebody who has been involved with the 60s, former head of Fort Huachuca Army Intelligence where ET craft and bodies are stored. When later in the video we'll talk about Greer referencing a source at Fort Huachuca who worked there in the 70s to talk about ET craft and bodies. But this is also somewhat at odds with Greer's original statement that Stubble, Stubblebine specifically tried to intimidate him. But I would have a high bet here that this is probably General Albert Stubblebine. So Greer states he was approached by insiders when he was a 30, when he was in his 30s. He labeled these guys as white hats or good guys or blue team as we'll discuss earlier. If you remember from the majestic video, kind of blue team, red team, these are often labeled to be UFO craft retrieval operators. So don't get that confused as we talk about blue team guys. These are going to be guys that Greer states are black program insiders who are kind of good guys who want the truth to come out. People Greer states were sent to him because top brass in the Pentagon weren't read into the UFO situation. Greer makes a direct mention to briefing Admiral Thomas Wilson, which of course is now really interesting with Eric Davis confirming the Wilson Davis notes. But he also talks about him briefing the CIA director in the early 90s. And I know this is a contentious point about Greer briefing the CIA director. I believe he states he sat down and briefed the director. And I believe the counter argument to that is Greer just blasted out an email to the CIA director who just kind of read it and threw it in the bin. So I'm not sure if that conversation has advanced very much. Stubblebind died in 2017. Yeah. He's no longer with us. So we can't be contacted here. And Greer says a lot of this kind of contact about good guys, white hats, blue team in the air who contacted him wanting to kind of restore oversight to black programs was under the Clinton administration. So this for me is a new line of research to head down kind of what went on under the Clinton administration. So let's go on to slide two. Sorry. Sorry. Wrong window. Let's go on to slide two. Here Greer talks about how if you guys remember the 2001 disclosure briefing document, I highly recommend it. Let me pull it up. If you guys have never read this document, it is brilliant. It's it's Greer's best piece of work. And I will always stand by that. This is fantastic. But Greer states he was asked to make his disclosure briefing document in order to brief Senate intelligence and the armed services staff. So this would have been in the early, mid to late nineties. Greer states he was contacted by the most senior person, a staff for Senate of the gang of eight. And this member of the gang of eight and his senior staff are kind of knocked on the doors internally in the Department of Defense and the Pentagon, but were denied. So Greer also states he was brought in a skiff, but didn't need clearance. Because his DPR DPI archive had more actionable intelligence and information than the intelligence community on UAP. So that was pretty, that was pretty interesting to me. Greer was then approached kind of earlier in the 2020s into a skiff. He said he brought the Trump presidential briefing document to a skiff. We know that Lou Elizondo and Ross Colt Hart have stated that Trump has brought in a skiff. Trump has been somewhat, if not fully briefed into the UAP situation. I still haven't really researched that. So I don't really have an opinion. Greer likes to add in these little details to kind of add drama. It's great showsmanship actually. It kind of really engages the audience. He says in this specific meeting there was a bourbon bottle in the middle of the table. Within 10 minutes, the intelligence guys were desperately reaching for the bottle. It's just a little bit of unnecessary fluff. Greer states he has been in skiffs multiple times, each with top secret, secret, compartmentalized intelligence. Clearance folks who were all astonished at how long Stephen Greer has been doing this, pushing for disclosure. So Greer now kind of talks about this law enforcement update. And this is where things get really interesting guys. So if you're kind of halfway paying attention, I would lock in here because this is a little bit of new stuff from Greer. Greer states he is in contact with top tactical operations people. These are Green Berets, SEALs, JSOC people who are all coming together behind closed doors to support Greer. All these commanders, these current tactical operations officers are seeking briefings from Greer. They have been asked by somebody, not sure because Greer doesn't devolved to bring black projects back under congressional oversight. So in summary, Greer's stating that a lot of JSOC leaders are being asked to bring the program back under control and moving with Greer. This is very interesting. Greer says, and I quote, that there are plans or possible plans to quote unquote, roll on dugway proving grounds, Area 51, Edwards Air Force Base and other black sites. Roll on. He says, take them back. If taking these sites back involves any sort of force or a legal entry or brute force entry, does this not egregiously violate OPSEC? Because I think what Greer is referring to is by force taking back these sites that he says are under black project control because Greer also goes on to state that black program leaders dwarf Hitler and the Nazis, which, you know, that's always never a in great taste. Yes, he has mentioned this before on kind of podcast before about forcibly enter entering these sites. But I don't think he's fully pieced everything together with kind of who he's talking to in order to do that. But I could absolutely be wrong. For the SAP whistleblower protection Greer has been talking about. Since June, 2024, Greer has been tasked and with others for providing OPSEC for whistleblowers, 762 of these according to Greer. These cover individual for all firsthand individuals according to Greer, people who are there when craft were shot down, reverse engineered, etc. The program is operational for US whistleblowers only with his show in. It could be wrong. I very well could be wrong. We're talking about Greer's project today, his speech in London, his event there. There was a webinar. There was an in it kind of in person show I bought the pay per view. So we're talking about that. Florian, thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Thank you very much. He might have talked about it on Sean Ryan. He might have. I got to listen to that again. But yeah, Greer does suck at OPSEC something will continue to talk about today. So yeah, so this this program Greer States is for US whistleblowers only. He's trying to get something set up in the UK. He basically asks for funding and backing there. And this is a special access program to protect firsthand whistleblowers from presumably threats on their life. Greer talks about deep cover defectors. And he addresses this in parallel to catastrophic disclosure. He states there's a group currently with performing operations within black projects who are trapped within the system. Greer States is trying to work with these people to kind of, you know, bring these black operations back under congressional oversight or possibly roll on them if that needs be. Greer also goes on to talk about how after his viewing of a dumb entrance, which we'll talk about soon, he was almost killed. This is a gross exaggeration. He fell. He fell off his bike. So yeah. So sorry, let me let me get through a couple of comments here. Let's see Greer sucks at OPSEC got my PC admitting he I'd like to see that if you would like to post that. As well. Lazar was used for soft disclosure. Get the attention of Harry Reid. He was 23 and an eccentric. Interesting. Yes, I have that's that's also great. I think that's kind of making the news rounds of late. Very interesting. So Greer likes to state that 90% of what is known in ufology is disinformation. He states he has the 10% that is considered real information included in the 90%. This is a slide from the presentation is that we don't have man made UFOs. This is a point kind of I have really sort of changed my position on in the past few months. The alien threat interdimensional phenomena, which is weird because Greer will later on in the second half of this presentation talk about internet interdimensional phenomena. ETs are demons, abductions, weapons in space. When the truth and we'll kind of get into this in the second half as well is really kind of new age woo stuff. If you if you guys know what that is about kind of raising consciousness, vibrations, stuff like that. See, peaceful CE5 contact enlightenment, universal peace. And I'm not saying there's nothing to that. I just think it's a I always think it's interesting when people claim to have all the answers when Greer says that 90% of what's known in ufology. Is disinformation, but his 10% is the true information. Greer talks about DPI archive. He says that it will take years for people to sift through all the information. That's just demonstrably untrue. We can sit through the info here. Of course, we have 13 sections here. Greer says he has a 14th session here that he can't wait to talk about and post on the site. So I'm really excited to see that. Or thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Starbucks is extremely, extremely expensive. Consciousness is the key to all of this. I absolutely agree. There's there's much of kind of human cognition, human consciousness in terms of the UAP phenomena. I just find it a little bit strange when Greer says that his 10 he is the one who holds 10% of the true information. So Greer, and now is when we'll kind of go into a little bit of the discussion of some of the whistleblowers and witnesses he talks to. Something I took special note of, which I found kind of funny is Greer talks about the pages and pages, the 23 pages of redacted witnesses. But Greer says he likes to honor the whistleblowers request for confidentiality. Anybody who's seen any of my videos will know that's just his operational security is absolutely dreadful. So next we'll start talking about illegal operations, locations, corporations based on intel from his witnesses. You guys know the Greer facility list. If you don't let me pull that up facilities maps and list. So Greer has all of these facilities, including maps pointing towards them. Sorry, that looks nice and reversed colors. All of these are garnered from the pages of witness testimony here. For example, you know, we can look at Dugway Proving Grounds as given by MS. We can go over here to a little place in Indiana where we might know a spot and so on. But and so Greer talks about now the first dumb entrance to which he was taken to. This is he states is the anthill in the eastern desert of California or western desert of Nevada. Let me pull up with this place is called because I actually found it and I need to. Sorry guys just give me a second here. I need to find out exactly what this place is called again. So I can get you guys exact exact locations. Greer states this location that we're talking about is basically an entrance to a dumb or a deep underground military base. If you can go online, you can find this exact place. Sorry guys. It's what's known as a volcanic cinder cone like volcano offshoots. Greer stating this is a dumb entrance and let me pull up the exact place. Sorry. I forgot what this place is is called. Is it called the Salt Lake? Yes. Okay. Got it. If you want to find this place on Google Maps, this is called the Salt Lake Cinder Cone. Okay. This is the exact entrance that Greer is stating is a dumb entrance right here the Salt Lake Cinder Cone. I can get a nice zoom in. This, as I said, is a cinder cone. We can look by because these generally occur near volcanic activity. And I think there's a volcano located about 25 miles or so northeast of this location. I'm not sure if these are other cinder cones. I'm not a rock specialist, but this location right here. I don't understand where the entrance here is. If anything, this possibly could be dirt moved for underground locations, but I don't know where an entrance could be in this location. Let me say a couple, thank you guys real fast. And we got the next location to talk about a little something to somewhere. Thank you very much. Tell us and thank you for the boost too. I really appreciate that. Maglevs connecting all the DUNS. Yes, we will talk about that too because Greer touches on it. Sorry. My questions are, are you familiar with Northrop Ant Hill? Yeah. Greer calls this Northrop Ant Hill, I think. I'm actually, because he calls this the Ant Hill as a DUM. So he calls this, yeah, as we can see the Ant Hill. Sorry. Okay. Crackerjack, thank you very much. Greer stones. I turn over. Greer does awesome work and he, I still recommend checking out all of his documentaries and kind of paying attention to what he says because it's very interesting. So you guys will probably know this site. Next, Greer talks about the Hellendale site, the Lockheed Martin Hellendale site. Now what's really interesting here guys is let's get back to the DPI archive. So if we go to UFO kind of secret related facilities, top priority documents and so forth with some photos of stuff. A Hellendale location, there used to be multiple images on here. So I'm not quite sure why Hellendale was taken off of the DPI archive. And I can also state for a fact that within the presentation today, Greer didn't mention Hellendale. So I don't know, I really don't understand what the play here was. I don't know who this is attempting to kind of confuse or fool, especially because people in my discord, as I post this live, there was a user. It's really smart guy. His name is rectified. He knew he said immediately, hey, this is Hellendale. And I'm sure multiple people recognize it as well. So within the presentation, Greer stated that he didn't say the name Hellendale and the images of Hellendale have been stripped off the DPI archive. But he Greer states that this director of black operations took him to this Hellendale site. He says that this Hellendale plant is a staging ground for electro gravitic ARV or alien reproduction vehicle. I'll be saying ARV the rest of the time. The diamonds here on the runway Greer states are for using kind of scalar technologies. So scalar technologies to kind of test human made ARVs and their resilience to kind of EMP weaponry or to bring down ET craft. Greer states that I think one to two craft are brought down by this site in particular, maybe all sites a year. He also brings up an image of this site at the Hellendale plant says this is EMP weaponry. And that the EMPs are used in conjunction with scalar technology to knock out craft a year that this site has been operational for black program duties for upwards of 40 years. The person the black operations director who flew him over this Greer states in this presentation that this same individual has personally been present at ET craft shoot down and personally recovered craft and bodies. So real fast Florian, thank you so much. I really appreciate the euros from Germany. Have you seen above majestic I have. What is your take about alien human bases on the mood and Antarctica and space travel for decades now. There's a lot of really interesting kind of witnesses in the DPI archive specifically about UFO and NHI signatures on the moon and I would like to explore those further. I don't think they're out of the realm of possibility. I just think that that specific topic needs a lot of a lot more hard nose research, a lot more hard nose research. So next, as you guys know from the facilities list. Greer has a list of numerous, numerous, numerous, numerous facilities. Most if not all of these guys have been referenced in the DPI archive. Sorry, I'm the 2001 disclosure briefing document. See here, China Lake. I'm in that place. So I don't think much has changed on this facility list. Greer also talked about this in a 2016 speech. I have referenced quite a bit, including my work on Doug way. I mean, this is I haven't fully taken a look yet, but this is just copied verbatim since 2001 or I think 1996 is when this specific place was or this specific list was compiled for the DPI archive. So we'll keep going. Sorry, I'm just kind of trying to organize my notes. A lot of the times my notes are sloppy are pretty sloppy. Continuing on with the sites. Oh, yeah, yeah, Greer made specific reference here. Very specific reference here is about the Los Alamos National Labs. I know you guys have probably all heard of Los Alamos National Labs, but he talks about a maglev system under Los Alamos connecting it to other dumb locations. He states, I don't know how he got this intel, but he states that Los Alamos has direct access to Kirtland AFB and Dulce. I can never, you guys know, I don't know how to speak, but Greer likes to kind of claim here that any above ground duties about the Dulce base are completely false. And this is just one large below ground dumb. There's a lot of interesting work on this. I can't remember exactly what the pieces right now that I've talked before UFO highway. It might be called, which is a good PDF that talks about the Dulce location. Greer says that this Dulce place is where it contains biotech labs where fake ETS, aka PLF programmable life forms are made. Interesting to me as well Greer state specifically that some of these dumps were built in the 1980s. At least in my research, I feel like I've seen plenty of discussion that dumps have come come around a little bit before that. But I do want to bring something up about, sorry, I do want to bring something up about in the DPR archive. I seem to have ex exed out of that tab, but Greer has some patents for a huge boring underground boring machine that he states was used for kind of building these maglev systems. Creating the deep underground military bases. Yes, it is. This is Jack Ramanson's gym. I love repping this gym. Awesome gym. Okay, look, keep going here. And now at this time because Greer has multiple pages he talks about in terms of underground bases that we already have listed on that primary site. Sorry, trying to pull this up. He again talks about Fort Hachuca. And again, I will reference that I believe that the witness 10658 in the DPR archive is really major Albert Stubblebine, which conflicts of Stephen Greer's earlier claims that Stubblebine tried to intimidate and create fear within Stephen Greer. Interesting reference here about Pine Gap underground facility in Australia. He says this is a transnational majestic location. Doesn't say majestic 12 just as majestic. Now, I do know of an intelligence guy. He's a friend of mine who says he has been to Pine Gap and didn't see anything there doesn't think anything could be there. But then again, I don't think he was given access to the entire facility. Mention of Doug way proving grounds outside here will go. Okay, so when I interviewed MS, I think I gave very vague directions to the entrance that he claimed was for the Doug way dumb. I just said it was near German village in Utah. Greer gives. In fact, he gets my pin for this place. So I can give you guys that exact location to and because Greer has kind of violated this upset here. Greer talks about UFO related facilities and companies here. I don't think anything really new is going to stand out here. He adds kind of in the he has talked about this in his 2016 briefing. I think this is what he added that SAIC is a crown jewel here because in the same presentation he mentions. Sorry, he also mentions I talked about her in my NSWC video with RA about the testimony of Denise McKenzie, a former SAIC employee who would talk about being large contracts with nothing actually on the books. So next we move on to a witness. I actually hadn't seen and this can be pretty interesting. So Greer talks about project mannequin in 1997, a top secret underground based genetic engineering PLFs, please in P'smore UK under witness BK. And you guys know that I will give you the exact witness name. Well, this isn't one, but this is somebody connected to this witness BK witness 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive. Again, that's 10 0 6 8 in the DPI archive. And here's the witness 10 412. This is the witness that Greer is stating has information on PLFs and an underground dumb in the UK. So project mannequin at RAF P'smore has seen and touched gray beans bred in NSA underground base evidence of military committing abductions globally. So in the DPI archive. 10 412. We won't go through all these documents right now. But under 10 412 this individual BK. There's quite a bit of interesting documents to research, including some alleged actual documents smuggled out of this project mannequin, which is presumably to make PLFs. According to this individual, there are also sketches from this individual BK about the creation of PLFs, the manufacturing of like a classic gray and so forth. And that this project mannequin is also in charge of making what we would think of as the classic reptilian design along with the grays. I think project came a lot interviewed the piece more winners. I haven't seen that I'll absolutely have to check that out. So, and now this will be one that kind of me close some of these tabs guys. Sorry. Let me close some of these tabs. Greer then gets into the infamous TV. So, out of respect. I am not going to talk about who TV might be or his name. I understand that's definitely out there. And people know about this individual or might know, but so I'm not going to bring that up, but there's plenty about there. So, initially, this Lawton, Oklahoma case with TV, this is in reference to some statements by TV to Stephen Greer in which some technology was leveraged from this crash that was used at Fort Sill, Oklahoma base in 2003, where General John M. Riggs showed off classified cloaking technology to a BAE systems employee, where he was then unceremoniously retired. Now, the kernels of truth in this statement are that General John M. Riggs was in fact demoted a star upon his retirement and sent basically to the basement of the Pentagon and handed in his clothes and said, you're gone. So, he was very unceremoniously retired and according to I think it's a Baltimore Sun article. This was for improper use of contractors. So, I think I have these in my video with TV, but Greer just kind of posts some images of kind of the crash retrieval that occurred in Lawton according to TV. He also posts this ARV looks very, I don't think this is actually in reference to an ARV according to Greer, but posts a craft in an underground facility. What we would probably know as Mark McCandless is Fluxliner ARV. Fluxliner, if you know that name, Greer also at the end of the project says that the Fluxliner name was actually used for Lockheed's first generation of ARV craft. I didn't know this because this wasn't provided in the notes with TV, but apparently this location right here is an underground base actually in Oklahoma near Fort Sill. So, that might be a location to look at Fort Sill, the Lawton area for any sort of bases down there. Greer also states that some craft shot down break into pieces while others have sort of a controlled landing due to being stunned. This has more relevance to the infographics whistleblower when he's talking about eggs and bells, bells being the most commonly crashed craft and that the vast majority of the time they almost disintegrate break into pieces or basically melt away like nothing is there. So, that's an interesting connection there. Greer dropped some specific terminology when he was talking about this location when we get a sip of cold brew. He states that retrieved NHI living bodies are not referred to as extraterrestrials. They are kind of referred to as evens, extraterrestrial biological entities as you know but with an N on the end. But these individuals that are taken alive are called captives or refugees and those are the exact words but used by Greer. Next on to Mr. MS, we know him very well. So, at this point covering a TB and MS back to back we got a little UFOs witness list action going on which you know I always like to see. Greer talks a little bit more and gives a little bit more insight apparently because apparently he has some more connections and things to study about the craft that MS saw. If you guys remember from that video MS stated to have seen like a basically inverted cone triangle section at the bottom of the craft. New drawing here from Greer's archives. I wonder if this is a shrap drawing if it is that's great Michael Schratz the best. But Greer states to have some insight on this on the pyramid we talked about which we kind of I don't really remember if I hypothesized about it. But Greer stated that he kind of knew factually that this inverted pyramid is an EMP crystalline structure that causes objects to basically travel instantaneously. It likens the abilities of this piece to like a astral projection functionality. This is a good question why are all these people talking to Greer instead of Congress could they be doing the latter in secret they absolutely could remember we talked about TB and his witnesses in his messages to Greer here was summoned to testify before members of the gang of eight including Marco Rubio in 2022. Yeah whistleblower protection is terrible remember guys the witness or whistleblower protection doesn't cover pensions so that was something that Greer had stated kind of in media about specifically TB that he was afraid for both his life and his pension. So even with these whistleblower acts your pension is not covered and love these guys with families and stuff this is presumably what they're worried about. Okay MS Dugway render we know this from the video. We know this from the video group post some images. These look these look a little familiar to me. But so let's go to the exact entrance. German village in am I going to Utah I don't know if I'm going to Utah. Well before I get to that. Group post an untitled place mark changing the colors of a plate of a mark that could only be me but so the Greer posted this on the DPI archive okay I'm just going to show that once again in his recent updates. It was in. Wow, I guess he just took that off really recently. Okay. Last time I checked this in the critical updates Greer had posted image for the anthill and the Dugway site in Greer's presentation he posts this image for the Dugway location. And let me try and find it. Dugway German village. I got to remember my exact location now here guys. Let me think. Let me I got to think about the exact coordinates here. Oh man this might be tough a little bit south of Dugway German village. We might be we're on the money. This is the location he provided. This is allegedly the entrance to the dumb right here according to what Greer posted in his September 8 2024 London press conference right. Just a bit northwest of Dugway German village. So I was a little interested to see him post that, but especially if he is talking about taking back such sites. I found that a little interesting. But now we can talk a little bit about a witness we talked about a little bit last week in the Greer archive about programmable life forms and so forth. This is witness TE. If you want to follow along in the DPI archive you can search witness 10892. Again that's 10892 and find relevant documents. German village. Where is German village. Just search Dugway German village. Right here. Dugway German village. Just a little bit northwest of this location. So, yeah, it talks about TE. This is a witness we talked a little bit about last week. And the story of TE is this individual approach Greer claimed to be on a specialized ARV retrieval team. Some artwork included here. I think this might be Rudy Garcia and some of Greer's team this artwork is really cool. This kind of triangle site is man made craft as you can see by the no step. This must be work by Michael Schrat, but it's a kind of a CAD drawing of this same device, the same craft. And eventually at some point this witness TE 10892 graduated from kind of ARV retrieval and was promoted to ET retrieval. So this event occurred and I can't remember what year this was. I know it's listed in the archive. This might have been 2004. Early 2000s where a sunflower type craft what crashed near or not crashed I'm sorry landed near Nellis. As you can see Greer also make specific mention to this ARV that was privy to this retrieval operation. If you can see here there's some soldiers lying in wait. This witness TE stated that as individuals approach this craft basically autonomy was taken away from all the soldiers and they were sent into basically like a stunned state. Out of this what you would see as a fruit roll up craft came some ETS that looked like this. And this is must be a Rudy Garcia drawing excellent drawing. And so forth this witness TE was really disturbed by this exact operation because he found these ETS and they're kind of emerald blue eyes is so peaceful and kind of pure that he thought what the retrieval teams and shooting down craft were doing was sick. So he tried to basically defect and leave the retrieval force. Greer states that this individuals uncle who grandfathered him into the program was the only one who stopped this individual from being killed. Upon his release TE was targeted with a fake abduction where he was approached by these creatures and basically took brute force to them and found circuitry and so forth within. So next we'll go to the next witness talked about some of you guys might know this person some of you might not I have actually been trying to get in contact with Shannon Lee for a while. Shannon Lee is a witness who claimed to I can't 2008 2009 off the coast of I think it was Guam while in the Navy or the Coast Guard participated in a saucer retrieval from the ocean where a craft was almost tangled in the Japanese fisherman's net. And this was in conjunction with the US Marines. So again I've been trying to contact this guy for months. Here's the image of the retrieval operation. He actually did an interview with Steven Greer. I can't remember if it's on the DPI archive or not. I'll actually try to find it and post it but the actual video was taken off of Greer's was taken off of Greer's YouTube page. And I think this was maybe because I think Mr Lee suffered maybe from some social anxiety or something because the interview was just a little bit awkward. It was just a little disconjointed and stuff but I've always found this interview extremely interesting because according to Lee this craft was so heavy it almost toppled the Navy craft as it was lifted up in its net. Greer stated and Shannon Lee states that this artwork right here is a little bit off the craft was had no seams kind of no pathways just a really solid seamless craft and he tried to take a sharp object to it and to no effect. To no effect. So upon returning Shannon Lee was forced to sign numerous NDAs and so forth. And you guys might know this individual from the disclosure from the National Press Club conference. He was very sickly. He looked it looked really. I don't know if it was from his encounter or from just health. I think he mentioned he had a brain injury but Steven Digna. In his testimony before kind of an abduction case he talks about being on a bombing range where he was with two Raytheon employees where they saw a large boomerang shaped craft. And I believe one if not both of these craft yes Greer talked about this was a projection. And here is a little bit where Greer dove into kind of the project blue beam kind of fear mongering stuff he talks about these projection techniques you know if you see a craft over London they can produce numerous craft and kind of fake an invasion and so forth. But this was apparently a Raytheon craft that had entered into the bombing range for clandestine purposes I don't know for whatever purposes it seems strange to do that over an active bombing range and yes. Steven Digna was suffering a brain injury I wish him peace he looked like he was suffering quite a bit from there. So Greer stated here as well that anti gravity technology in which this Raytheon craft was based off of was mastered in October of 1954. Sorry. Next of course. Greer talks briefly about Michael. We all know Michael from this channel. He shows the video made by Star Labs of the octagonal craft. We've all seen these so I'm not going to waste space or so forth but Greer had one new detail about Michael story that I wasn't aware of. And I'll certainly bring it up to Michael Greer thinks this craft was Lockheed skunk works or EG and G. Why I don't know exactly why he thinks that. But that is what Greer states here he doesn't expand on that anymore he just kind of moves on. Greer states the initial misconceptions of him and thinking this was kind of drug smuggling operations of course I've talked about Michael initially thought when he saw this was drugs. Greer kind of assumed also Greer has talked to witnesses who state that ARVs are used for smuggling drugs. One of these witnesses I think his files were removed from the DPI archive I think it was witnessed. Sorry let me I'll look this up. Let me see if I got it right. Yes, 10329 right here in the DPI archive. I think his files were taken down, but witness 10329 right here. Worked in deep black projects as knowledge of advanced crafting connections to drug running knows of two sites near Nashville Tennessee where craft have been seen landing. Same locations were used by the CIA slash 160 if that's an Air Force division locations are private airship and another in a valley between mountains. So I've talked a little bit to this person I will talk to them again and you know if there's some interesting stories to make. I will absolutely make them real quick scallions. I love you. Thank you so much for your support. I really really really appreciate it really appreciate it. Yeah, here kind of with most of these stories guys Greer will talk about the witness will talk about what's going on and then kind of round it back to himself like. Greer was talking about Michael and then states that after the 2023 NPC that his YouTube was hacked and demonetized and. That just wasn't a necessary addition to me but Greer then talks what I talked about in my interview with Michael that the insider who spoke to Michael was at the NPC 2023 and exact quote from Greer that this insider said to him quote. That is worse than your Marine guy thinks it is end quote you guys know I like those quote end quote this individual the insider that Michael has spoken to claim to have been part of this operation. And then. As you'll know this from Michael's testimony Greer starts talking about P3 psionic predisposed I can't remember exactly what pre P3 stands for at the moment my brain is going a mile per minute, but he talks about kind of P3 assets a little bit and if you guys. Remember this from Michael story and then Ross cult her Ross Colt heart talking about consciousness and so forth. But these individuals are basically used to interact with with ET craft recovered craft, or I think in some cases as Greer likes to stay kind of lower craft in. Consciousness technology and P3 operator technology hijacking of ET craft target and bring them down or take control of them. Greer states that this is a theme. This is a this was a very strange slide to me guys. I found it strange that Greer brought in hand dominance and preference and individuals into accountability for psy abilities. I wasn't. I certainly have never heard that anywhere and I have not heard that I probably won't hear that again. But Greer states that most of these P3 assets these people who are tasked with in kind of interacting with ET craft with their consciousness connection most die. Those who cannot do the work are used as forced laborers and maintenance in side the facilities and some are now defecting to disclosure project. I would like to hear a little bit more about that. And at this time, Greer mentioned a base in the Chihuahua Desert used to house P3s. This is a reference to the sentinels of ethers kind of dops or play written by Michael or ghost written by Michael's insider that he's contacted, which talks about we talked about this all last week 2004. What we can now assume is a Lockheed Martin recovery team wiping out a JSOC team. The differences in sentinels of ether involves trafficking P3 assets in John Stewart source. It involves tracking it down to craft. So then Greer went for quite a while on a story about a dream he had when he was around 18 and knew the structures of the cosmos. This was about this was a while kind of leading after discussing Michael and P3s. And this, of course, Greer reiterates that at some unknown time he was approached and offered $2 billion to kind of hush up in defect, not really defect, not really joined black programs, but to stop talking and stop working on the DPA archive. I think he's discussed this quite a little bit. Of course, at this time, this is obviously very powerful for Greer. He got pretty emotional at this time. And I can understand that, especially working on such such kind of huge stuff in his life, you spent so much time doing this. But, you know, I can sometimes I have trouble separating, you know, maybe some of this stuff is sympathy plays for Greer when he talks about himself so much, kind of getting emotional about that. But who knows who knows. So at this point we had an intermission, I think it was about 30 minutes. And when we come back from the break, most things were focused on kind of consciousness and so forth. So Greer kind of breaks down what he states is the UFO phenomenon it's broke down between ET interdimensional beings and classified black programs usaps and basically human reverse engineer technology. I'll leave this up for a couple seconds. But Greer likes to distinguish the fact or distinguish between ET craft and the DPI archive. The guy has poured his entire life into this. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Greer has put decades, decades, decades. Stubblebind was the one who offered him $2 billion. Has he said that before? I might just be messing out actually. That's interesting. For some reason it doesn't. Is there a link that's not working? Tell us that. If there's a link that's not working. I thought this was a really interesting here guys. Look under the classified unacknowledged special access programs you'll see holographic man made beings from thought forms. Now if you guys know anything about like old, I can't even think to where this practice begins, but topos like a thought forms that manifest conscious beings. I'm just, that's a lot. That's a huge thing to put into a PowerPoint without really expanding on it further, especially saying that Lockheed skunk works essentially manifest topos. So, yeah, so, yeah, so Greer talks about that both the extraterrestrial and ultra dimensional hypothesis of non human intelligence is through that both of these exist on our planet. They're just differentiated. Most of what we can see as physical craft are in fact ET or ARV alien reproduction vehicles human made and Greer states that the vast majority of sightings of UFO, especially in today's age are actually ARV technology human made technology and not not real kind of ET craft. A lot of the ultra terrestrial stuff is kind of what you hear a little bit more about attached with woo in the phenomena, kind of floating orbs the poltergeist phenomena and so forth. A lot of this talk kind of dove into a little bit more of the kind of woo stuff discussing a lot of physics talk with quantum thrown in here and there to kind of make things sound a little bit more mysterious. We referenced the show stranger things as a description of summoning ultra terrestrial beings. This reminds me very closely of Alex Jones claims of of of of individuals high up in clandestine government operations who will take a bunch of DMT and then go talk to spirit programs. Next, Greer, sorry. And this time, Greer kind of discuss started to really get into kind of the consciousness aspect of of UAP, a lot of talk about kind of new age concepts like light beings and stuff. Some of the interesting stuff that Greer discusses is that human programs and abilities are now very close and comparable to what ET technology has. And this is very interesting to me. Especially when you think about kind of analyze witness testimony of human made ARVs the possibility they work on electrogroupics like the TR3B and so forth. I, it's really interesting to think about if human capabilities are near ET and the implications of that are that would mean that human these black programs have unrestricted use of basically surrounding basically unrestricted use of our solar system and other space time, what kind of operations are they getting up to and so forth is a very interesting question. And that Greer likes to state that humans are now an existential threat to ET. Part of this is because Greer states the technologies ET extraterrestrials use are non local. A lot of these technologies require a craft being or technology to basically remove itself from 3D space time entered folds between dimensional space and pop up elsewhere. And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second. Yeah, the the holographic consciousness universe. This stuff at least I know this interests a lot of people. That's why of course I'll put it up here. It's not as big as my focus. You guys know it's reverse engineering and crash retrieval. So I might be a little not as knowledgeable on this topic here. So if I sound ignorant or I'm just kind of skipping through stuff that you find really interesting. That's my bad. I'm just not as well versed on on such topics quickly Greer really kind of leaned into remote view. Sorry, wrong tab. Greer really leaned into remote viewing at this point and went on for a couple minutes about how he himself can levitate. That was that I think is a bit a bit. That's a bit of a stretch for me in terms of saying you can levitate and so forth. I don't really see how that fits into this discussion even when speaking about consciousness and so forth. But we'll keep going because I want to get to Greer had Greer posted what he thinks of as his own Kardashev scale guys. So you guys know the Kardashev scale. It's a ranking of basically civilizations throughout the cosmos. Humanity is what's known as like a level like 0.7 on the Kardashev scale. A level one Kardashev scale is able to harness the entire energy output of its host planet. A type two Kardashev scale is able to harness the total energy output of its host son. And a level three Kardashev civilization is able to harness the entire energy output of its home galaxy. There are kind of more expansions on on this and different breakdowns. But Greer states that current human civilization is consumed by war. It's very primitive environmental technologies and it's plagued by extinction level events. A global peaceful civilization. And I think this is Greer's ultimate goal to leave us lead us towards especially when you look at the lost century. His next video in which he really push is for kind of the the utilization of zero point energy and technologies that have been obfuscated. And hidden with E.T. reverse engineering. I'm just laughing at Mr. Mosilli's comments were zero. Yeah, that's funny to me. And a permanent P.I. I think this is a great point by Kai Greer magically assumes that humans are going to magically start loving each other. And if we know NHI and advanced technology is real, yes, I disagree. I think he I think a lot of that is he. Arrest that on claims of like Ronald Reagan and his speech where he says I can't think of how fast humanity would come together if we face like an alien threat and so forth. I agree. I don't think that can be utilized to solely bring humanity together. But a permanent P civilization develops trans dimensional technologies when you read that trans dimensional technologies just know that that's what I discussed when Greer says that a lot of these E.T. technologies are non local that they require the Utilizer of the technology to basically leave our current space time travel through dimensional folds reengaged another point of space time. The pursuit of science and consciousness. Okay, we can go to but the the weird thing about this guys is Greer only posted to two of four of these slides. Greer says there's four levels of civilization. He only posted two slides. You can see two of four here. He only posted the slide before in this one. So that was pretty funny to me the level three and interstellar civilization clear to travel to other star systems. However, if humans have ability similar to E.T. now, could we not feasibly travel to other star systems as well. Development of widespread establishment of science of consciousness pursuit of higher states of consciousness early integration into other interstellar civilizations. I do think the pursuit of consciousness needs to be integrated into a kind of us a level zero current current human civilization as well. I think consciousness study is a is integral to the human experience, especially how it relates to UAP technology. That is not something that should be overlooked. It's still a concept that I'm can be quite unfamiliar with and quite uncomfortable with sometimes. It's still really new to me concepts like P3 concepts like remote viewing consciousness studies still very new to that subject. So if I'm ever ignorant towards it, that's why I'm still learning a level four cosmic consciousness civilization above 1% of something. Senior ambassadors are enlightened in cosmic consciousness contact with other advanced civilizations. However, wouldn't a level three interstellar civilization be able to do the same? But according to this same log, if a cosmic consciousness civilization can provide guidance to emerging civilizations, would a level zero civilization such as humanity not be a emerging civilization? Or would we need to be a level one or two a global peaceful civilization global peaceful civilization to receive contact and level five part of the senior interstellar collective. My question to Greer is where is he getting this information? What is he basing this off of? I would I would really like to know because it's really interesting to me of enlightenment widespread and accelerated experience or innate. I don't know what that word means. I'm sorry guys technology parallel states of consciousness. So Greer talks about some CE five stuff now. And he posted a lot of images. Most were just kind of vague shapes, not much to him. He posted two images. Sorry wrong. He posted two images where actual forms can be seen from CE five contact. I took a special note of right here, but I need to shout out a dude in my discord right when I posted this. The same gentleman rectified he posted. Let me pull this up. This image right here on the right rectified posted that this was actually a sighting in Twitter in in Chile, sitting on Twitter in Chile. And as far as rectified knows, Greer is not associated with this sighting at all. So why why post this if it's not yours, man? Most of Greer's photos you can see a lot of CE five stuff on the DPI archive. The vast majority of them are lights in the sky. I'm totally not. I'm not totally closed off to CE five. I just haven't seen evidence for it, you know, especially when it comes to the images. It's just sort of really vague light forms. So of course, there's there's not much I can kind of study off of that. But I'd like to see more. So interesting to me, I'm sure you guys have all heard of a lot of the stuff that Jason Sands has been talking about that. John Ramirez talked about that Lou has talked about that that Jeremy Corbell and George not kind of like to dangle in front of you a date, a deadline, right? When I say that most people probably think of 2027 as a sort of deadline. I think it's associated with Jason Sands. He overheard he states he overheard communications between NHI and humans or NHI and NHI saying they want their stuff back. Greer made specific mention of the timeframe 2025 to 2030. Quote, if we haven't corrected this problem, it will be corrected for us. Greer states this is the worst case scenario that our mastery of ET technologies are a threat due to the fact these are non local technologies are harnessing and misuse of these technologies are affecting other solar systems. And fixing this thing for us would be a correction to protect other worlds, life on earth and life elsewhere. And that statement is kind of where Greer left the event. Of course, then there was an ovation and everybody clapped and left. So that was the that was the entire Greer catalog of his show today in London. And now that that's over, we can go through kind of if you have questions about the event questions about anything, let's go through them. We'll talk about the whole thing. If there's anything that stood out to you, we'll go through one by one and you guys know how I do. If there's any question, I will absolutely answer it. So we'll start going through those. Whoa, this is really over lit. How about that? It's really over lit. Sorry about that, guys. I don't know if that's better. So let's see. I'm going to leave it on. The main issue with Greer is he does not distinguish between what he knows due to evidence and what he is speculating on. He's pretty much in his own category among UAP sources. Yeah, I think it's crucial to for people when they're speculating to make sure that it's clear that they're speculating. I think this is what got like Jason Sands and a bit of trouble out the gate because he would just kind of ramble on about scenarios and ideas and wouldn't really kind of nail down and specify when he's saying, hey, I'm speculating. I don't know this for sure. I think with a lot of these witnesses in Greer's archive, I'm not sure to the extent to which he has vetted every single one of these sources. So when he claims he has 762 whistleblowers, this is pretty much every name redacted or unredacted on the log. A lot of these names that he states are under whistleblower protection. A lot of these are labeled as like UFO researchers. For example, you guys know I'm working on the Kexpert case. Stan Gordon is listed in there as a UFO researcher in point of contact to Kexpert witnesses. Does he need to be offered? If you guys don't know Stan Gordon, he was the primary Kexpert researcher. Did he need to be offered whistleblower protection? There's also a lot of the I feel like with the witness list and the facilities map. Greer was happy to beef up the content over quality of the content, right? I bet you can see what I'm saying. For each email he received, somebody making claims, it's easy to redact the email, redact the name, throw it on the DPI archive to say, hey, here's another witness. Look what they're saying now and so forth. Hey, Flying Lotus, what's up dude? Flying Lotus, if you guys don't know his music, Flying Lotus is awesome. I recommend checking out the Black Balloon reprise with Denzel Curry and Never Catch Me with Kendrick Lamar. Flying Lotus is great. What do I think about Richard Doty? I don't think he can be trusted. I think anything that Doty kind of connects his name to, it's almost impossible to get to the bottom of. All you have to do is look at Tobinowitz and his claims in a career's documentary Unacknowledged where he talks about the, I think it's the Roswell, yeah, the Roswell incident being some Russian dwarves, disfigured Russian dwarves and so forth. So I tend to stay away from Doty as much as I possibly can. What are your thoughts on Sans? Truthfully, I don't buy it at all, but would like to get your thoughts. I'm remaining agnostic to Sans until I get a chance to kind of speak to him direct. I know a lot of people, not a lot, I'd say I know about six people in the intelligence community and all of them, while they can't verify Sans' claims, they all speak very highly of him as an individual. So I find that interesting. Now, all these people that speak highly of him as an individual agree that the method in which he came forward was awful. You know, on Twitter spaces and to just engage with a lot of the Twitter drama and so forth. And I've heard that that's just kind of the type of guy Sans is. He just wants to get that information out there. He's got a great and kind heart. He knows him directly, speaks incredibly highly of him. So if I get a chance to speak to him, I'd like to. Until then, I'll probably just remain a little agnostic towards his case. I do not trust Greer. He's a shifty. I'll say it just like I've said a thousand times. Greer has brought forth so much great witnesses and documents and stuff to study. And then disclosure briefing document from 2001. I will swear by it is the best piece of literature. If one of the best pieces of literature on the UFO subject. Now, I agree with what Kai said earlier that Greer tries to make himself the center of everything. This was further enforced by Greer talking just inserting himself into everything. I forgot when he was talking about Michael. He was saying that how he like worked out with Michael and how big Michael was and how much it made him soar to work out with Michael. And it's, you know, it's, you know, why do you need to keep talking about yourself with all of that? He likes to make himself the centerpiece of everything, but he has done great, great work. Thanks for the shout out. I'm just following your leads and focusing on the approval. Yeah, exactly. There's just there's a ton of fluff and euphology and I know myself I have gotten caught going down some rabbit holes that lead nowhere and done some dead end work or work that I later found out is kind of just not much to it. But just kind of focus on what you can. I like how this channel attracts both people capable and willing to actually think and share lunatics. I don't, I don't know. I think everybody here is pretty, pretty crafty, pretty smart. I don't think I know of any lunatics in this chat. Everybody is pretty brilliant, especially as we saw last week, man. Everybody, everybody has something to say something to add. I'd love every single person in here. Implementing closed loop processes. Oh, I think I'm stumbling upon a conversation in the chat here. You guys keep going and I'll get the summary at the end. Definitely has hundreds of USAP whistleblowers in there. Correct. A lot, trust me as I've spent an uncomfortable amount of time pouring through the UFO witnesses list. And I plan to make multiple more videos on hold on. Let me actually ask you a question. There are a lot of sources that I want to cover in the redacted files that I have some interesting information on. Even if I can't talk to these people, because there are some others who I've identified who I'm trying to talk to. Even if I can't talk about them, do you guys still want me to cover them? Or is that kind of like a not as interesting? There's like a seven to 10 other people I would like to cover, but I've been hesitant to do so unless I have spoken to them. But if you guys still want to see that, even just kind of my research on there, I would gladly do that as well. Gladly. I appreciate it, Myer, that you speak your mind. That's the martial artist and you thank you very much. I got to be careful speaking my mind. I think just because I have a platform where I make videos, it's just important to kind of say when I don't know something. I'll speak my mind, but then I'll say if it's got some nonsense in there, then I'll say it. Have you heard about the big homie sea? Yeah, let me let me grab a quick drink of water. I'll do it away from the mic so I don't sound like a slurper in the mic. I have. I find it interesting, but I'm there's not much for me to investigate there, but it is interesting. Doty's sauce. I was surprised to make connections to lose book. Doty is very stuff. Sorry. You should research the connection between DMT and NHI. I forgot the name of the researcher who wrote that book, but he was working with John Mack. That's not the work of no, that's not Terrence McKenna. He worked with psilocybin. Right. I actually would like to pursue that more. I think it's very interesting because there's there's the claims of like Alex Jones of DMT and NHI, but then there's a lot more grounded research. So I would like to go down that rabbit hole. You staff disinformation agent. I think Doty was AFSOI, right? Maybe I targeted Benowitz. Yes. Crazy committed suicide. Yes. These are all great points for anybody kind of looking into Doty. Why all the hate on Greer? I think people just have very hot and cold opinions on Greer. I don't think that as that's much hate as it is people being rightfully critical of Greer. Now, people are often very critical of Greer and I support that, but I also preach time and time again. It's also important to give Greer credit where credit is due because Greer has done incredible work in the field of ufology would not be where it is today without Greer. Absolutely not. Hey, Towney 3057. Thank you for the Australian 30 bucks. I really appreciate that, man. Thank you so much for tuning in. Thank you very much. Other than personal opinions, what's the deal about Greer? This is just kind of what we discussed earlier that with a lot of witnesses, he will kind of make their story his own as kind of I saw firsthand and kind of make himself the center of everything in his event today. He practices terrible operational security stating that he cares for the sanctity of whistleblowers and their anonymity, but he violates OPSEC horrifically in the worst way I have ever seen with TV. I grappled with even publishing that his account for so long with TV because I knew that anybody could just hop on the DPI archive and find a name associated with it within seconds. But Greer violates OPSEC and I just don't think he does enough work to vet all of the people who contact him. I think anybody who kind of contacts him, if there's a story there, he just throws it into the witness list, right? Because there's in the witness list, I think it's just stuff for quantity over quality because there's so many names in that that are just like point of contact to other witnesses. And that stuff should just be used for internal use, right? Like there's no need for the average researcher like me to get any value out of witness. This isn't an actual number, but 11067 who is a point of contact to other points of contact. There's nothing of value there. Flying Lotus, thank you so much, dude. I appreciate that. I think coming up Flying Lotus and I are going to play some Black Ops as it comes out. If anybody else wants to play some Black Ops with us, we'll do it in the Discord and that should be a ton of fun. A ton of fun. Faking CE5 stuff, I've seen nothing about the CE5, so I really don't kind of know anything about that. But I do struggle with the images he posts that are supposedly CE5 stuff. It's just kind of lights. And as we saw with the saucer photo that was taken from a Chile case that as far as we know, Greer is not associated with that case. And again, I just want to say this again. I know I'm being very critical of Greer, but I could also spend an equal amount of time celebrating the great work he's done. I'm just going to shout out again the interview he did with Jonathan Wagan, which is a wonderful piece. And you can read the actual written description in the DPI archive. In the 2001 disclosure briefing document, he also provides his estimate on the Black Operation situation in terms of how this program operates quasi-nationally, basically performs off the books, has almost mastered extraterrestrial technology, commands ARVs and so forth. Excellent piece. I do need to state that Greer did in fact, maybe it's not necessarily a brief, but did speak to Admiral Thomas Wilson amongst others about UFOs in 97. That is true. That dude, you are that dude telekinesis beats. Thank you very much. Philip Corso is the smoking gun. Philip Corso is excellent. I have talked to an individual who the same they know some like inside stuff and corporations and they have recommended Corso, a lot of Corso's work. So that's really interesting. Greer has helped to further bring attention to UAP UFO, USO. So in some aspects, he did some good for the topic, but it's a double edged sword. So he's kept some that agreed. I think that's a really good way to put a double edged sword with the bad with with the bad with Greer. I'm going to start dosing in some of the good with Greer because even though a lot of today, today with the with the what's it called his event. I know I've I harped on a lot of points saying like old Greer stuffed himself into here, but still all of this work is is out of decades, decades of labor, decades will be Milo. I love you as well. Thank you very much. I guess we'll know moving forward who's full of crap and who isn't. I very much hope so. I absolutely hope so. Any thoughts on Tim Ventura and friends? Why do I know that name? You guys are going to roast me for not knowing Tim Ventura off the top of my head. Somebody remind me and I will remember. I will absolutely remember. Do I have plans to collaborate with any other UFO related YouTube channels night shift invented? I'm asking as they've shown keen interest in talking to you. No, that's not that's not so much my thing. Collabs, Jesse Michaels and John Michael Gaudier. Those are those are some collabs. I'll be doing and I will be seeing Jesse Michaels this week. And I can't wait for that because he just interviewed Lou and I can't wait to speak to him about that. That's going to be great. Grubbs equals goat. Thank you. You are goat. You are the goat Django. What do you think about Harold Malmgren and former personal dental advisor Malmgren is extremely interesting. And so is his daughter. And I would like to speak to his daughter as she has made some excellent claims as well. Excellent, excellent claims. What do you think about blood? So we discussed this last time I've remained similar to sans pretty agnostic to blood. So I don't want to put forward an opinion on anything unless I have a kind of well versed research. So I'll sit down, read some books about blood. So watch some interviews and so forth. And then I will form an opinion because I don't I don't want to just talk out of my behind. I want your view on your research as opposed to your view on others. I hope that's clear. A lot of people do great research here. I think that I just like to model my research a little bit more on like the old school researcher like the Dolan or the string field. I find power in the written word and I try to create something that would be a written word and translated into a video. I like the chasing down leads. I like I like a little this is the way to do. I like a little less news of the day type stuff and a little more long research into a topic. That's just kind of how I like to do things. I know everybody has their preference. I know everybody has a preference. Okay, let's go. Don't don't you think it's weird that Rogan is suddenly super skeptical about all this? I mean, from having a UAP in Lazare to not believe it anymore. Why didn't Lou talk about his book? Lou didn't talk about his book because Lou didn't want to sell his book on the podcast, which I very respect. You might have to just talk about the phenomenon. It's interesting how whenever there's a UAP related guy on Joe Rogan, Mike Baker, the CIA, former CIA guy is right there to clean it up. I think Baker has 14 appearances on Jerry. It's also really interesting to see Joe's. I think Joe just likes to believe kind of what's in the cool conspiracy, right? Because when he was really into UFOs, this was like 20 early or mid 2010s when the subject wasn't as popular as it was. There wasn't as much serious research. And he just kind of liked that it was more of a conspiracy. In a way, I think he's a little bit more of a calm Eddie Bravo. And we love Eddie Bravo. Joe Rogan's episodes with Eddie Bravo and Alex Jones are some of the best entertainment you will ever see ever. Speaking, your mind is potentially going to cost you. Are you scared even a little? No, I mean, I've probably crossed some toes, but it's all good. Rick Strassman, where have I heard that name before Lotus? Where have I heard that name? I've heard of Freedward Winterberg. That name rings a bell, but I can't reference it off the top of my head. I have come across the names Falcon and Condor. I think this was actually a career witness in 1980s in reference to like a blue team as well. I have to find those files, but yes, I have. Greer presents himself in a polarizing way, but if he's right even 10% of the time, then he's a valuable addition. Yes, absolutely. That's why everything that Greer puts out, I think needs to be researched independently from everything else and studied. People mainly criticize Greer because of CE5 and how he monetized it while appearing to provide no evidence that it works. I think so. I think that's a good point because a lot of the CE5 stuff is really pricey. I think in my Discord, I did kind of like an event revenue of this event that he did today just to kind of get a ballpark picture. I think the place in which he spoke in London housed like 800 people and we'll just say that it was at full capacity. Between tickets in there are $75 and then webinar tickets and stuff. I think it was like a gross of $45,000 and this wasn't counting the 1,500 to sit and have dinner with Greer. I just think he pushes the monetary incentive pretty heavy because he especially asks for donations and stuff for DPI archives. I think he just really pushes that. I'm not too well versed in psychedelics so I don't know how much I can answer there. Greer just in terms of the impact is made. It's up there with Jacques Villiers and Jean Mack and those figures he is. Greer is on the Mount Rushmore of UFO researchers and I will say that. Has Greer said anything recently about Lou Elizondo? I think Greer is critical of Lou Elizondo and I'm trying to remember that right now, but I do think that. I do think Greer is a charlatan. I can understand why you think so. There is a disinformation campaign to ruin Greer's name, especially on Twitter. I wouldn't be surprised, but I think Greer is one of those guys that they can just kind of let go and do his own thing because as you see in the comments, Greer is so polarizing. Everybody is so polarized about Greer. So many people think he might be a charlatan, so many people respect him, and so many people are in between. So I think Greer does that himself, to be honest. What are your thoughts on Rogan? Isn't it sus, suddenly a skeptic anymore? Yes, absolutely. I find it weird to think about when he had guests like Travis Walton on and Bob. I stay away from talking about Bob. I've said this before because I want so badly to believe Bob. I can't really look at his case with a critical analysis because if I see the discrepancies in education, I'll just try and explain it the way as best as I can. But Joe is so, so easy on Bob, especially when Bob had migraines when he couldn't answer a question. But Joe, when he spoke to Grosh in particular, I know because I've watched that interview like 50 times, was extremely harsh and not a very gracious host, in my opinion. Greer has beef with Elizondo. Yes. Sorry for repeating the question. It didn't come through before. I wanted to ask what made you consider the phenomenon being real? For me, it was the Nimitz incident since I am into jets. That's a good one. I think that, I don't know if there was one specific incident that made me just say, Holy cow, the phenomenon is real just because I've been studying this since I was just so young. In my mind, just with all the encounters I read about, especially when I was young, I was really into air force sightings and dog, not dog fights with craft, but like military sightings because I was so into military jets and UFOs. I've just always been like the back of my head until I reached an older age, just kind of had to assume there was validity to this and so forth. So I don't think there, I would like to hear from you guys, what was your like shining moment that made you say, Holy cow, this is real. I'd like to hear that from you guys. Rogan, Mike Baker, every time you talk, yeah, that's really funny. Lou said a prominent member of the disclosure movement is disinfo. He was probably referring to Greer. Yeah, that was on a Sean Ryan, right? No, that was Timber Shet, I think it was on the Sean Ryan show. He referred to, maybe I'm thinking of a different incident, but Timber Shet says something similar. I feel like you should do a video on DMT research in NHI as some people see entities on doing DMT. That'd be fun. I'd like that, but I will have to do a lot of research because I know very, very, very little about, I know very little about psychedelics, very little. I really think we should, yeah, I'm just not well versed. People like to crap on Greer for the sake of saying something. They don't bother doing the research and go very deep on it. ARV, Psychotronics, EMWs, DEWS, MKUltra, et cetera. I completely agree. A lot of the way Greer phrases stuff is very outlandish and standoffish. So even stuff like P3 and Consciousness Connection Greer has been talking about for a while. And I fell into the pitfall you're talking about, about kind of brushing that stuff golf because I thought it was a little too far fetched for me to pay attention to until I really started kind of sitting back and thinking about things. Have you ever done any videos on June Crane? I have not, but that would be interesting. Did you read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman? I didn't read Crash at Corona from Stanton Freeman, but I have read about the Corona crash and talked about it with Ryan Wood. And I think Wood as well as, I think James Rigney, the guy who leaked the Wilson Davis documents, thinks that some details of Roswell are kind of mixed in with other crashes around the same time. And one of those is Corona and so forth. What's your take on Rogan recently? I think you got warned by Feds to stop talking too much. I want to be surprised. I used to be a big Joe Rogan listener, but I feel like the quality of guests have died off and the talking points aren't nearly as interesting to me. What have you heard of Harry Drew and do you think he is honest? That is very interesting. I have, I spoke about Harry Drew and the Kingman Crash very recently. A certain, I'm not going to say their name just because I don't know if they want to kind of talk about that they're working on this. But an interesting channel and myself were trying to track down Harry Drew's documentary about what he had a documentary about Kingman. And we've been trying to track that down right now. It's only been really a DVD that was sold with his book on Kingman. I can't remember what it's called right now. Like the fifth day in May or something like that. I'm trying to remember what it's called. But yeah, Harry Drew is the person that proposed that there were three Kingman crashes. The first was a controlled descent. The second or first was a controlled descent and the second two were crashes, two of which contained bodies as well. And this occurred over in late May, 1953. Harry Drew is really interesting. I need to track down that dang documentary. Ross Campbell says Kingman is extremely important. I agree. I think it's crucial to track down that dang documentary and continue to study. I like to think back to the Chris Mellon signal exchange. He released with a USG individual who talked about an SES gatekeeper in the Air Force and Kingman. Joe got warned big time. I think it's very possible. I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep up with everything. If we talk about something, then like five minutes later, I get to the comment. I'm sorry about that, guys. Mike Baker talks for hours and says nothing. He does. I remember back in like 2017, I saw a Mike Baker episode and I said, Holy cow. What's it going to be? And this guy just jabbers, jabbers, jabbers, jabbers on with, with not much interesting to say. I dig Greer's view on drones versus UAP. I have a feeling he's on to something. The KMO drones jellyfish is a big retriever for DoD. Yeah. I found more and more. I've warmed up to the idea that there's a more of a mix of ARV versus UAP according to Greer. Bradley, what's up? You have missed quite a lot and I would recommend starting from the beginning because we talked about Greer's entire presentation today. Rick Strasman. I know Rick. Okay. Yes. Okay. I will read that. I will read that. That sounds really interesting. I think Rogan might still believe. Yeah. Yeah. Probably with that with how big Rogan is, he probably is just bombarded with so much as well. So much. Maybe people who are just claiming to have sightings and so forth that he just is a little bit jaded to the topic, which is crazy to me if he is jaded to the topic because he'll have guys like Lou and Grush on and kind of treat them not as pleasantly as I would have thought. Are you familiar with the alleged crash of a man made triangular ARV in East Germany? Was that in? Let me get out a copy of Magic Eyes Only. What year was that in? Sorry. I dropped my water bottle. I need to find out what year that was in. I want to say 80s, maybe earlier, but I do remember that case. Okay. Kai, I will look for you because I have heard of that case. You're saying it was Mark McCandlish. He talked about it. Was that when he talked? Okay. Let me see. I know I've heard about that. I'm just having trouble referencing. I appreciate the piece on Michael. He will be anointed hero. I hope so. I would very much like for Michael to be able to speak a little more. Very much like that. I appreciate Lou for being humble that he doesn't mention his book out late, despite essentially living in an ARV with his wife facing economic hardship. Since speaking out about UAP, UFO, USO, et cetera. Yeah. Whatever your view is on Lou, it is respectful that especially on JR, he doesn't mention his book once. Once. Falcon and Condor. Yeah. Aviary codenames. Rick Dodie is one of them. I think John B. Alexander is another. Oh, and this was a witness. A H A H in the Greer archive. I can't remember exactly what name it is. Slimy Toad made me fart real bad. Well, maybe you shouldn't take Slimy Toad, brother. Seriousness aside, Greer looks like a reptilian wearing a human meat suit. I hope he's not a secret reptilian. Is there a chance the government actually works together on this behind the curtains? Why? Yes. Five eyes to a degree. Five eyes nations. US, UK, New Zealand, Australia and Canada work together on this. You can look at a 2023 memo from Canadian politician Larry McGuire to the Canadian Minister of Defense that speaks about being more transparent about five eyes working together with UAP. If you listen to the UK whistle or sorry, the infographics whistleblower I covered and you take that testimony as a real testimony or just somebody giving a real testimony, you remember that Europe and many countries in Europe have been a default agreement with the US that the US gets ownership of those technologies. Really respect your view on Greer. Obviously you have issues with him, but you don't turn a blind eye to his data. Absolutely not. The DPI archive has been a true gift, a true gift. I have tried Greer CE5 protocols myself at home. It worked. Objects legit started appearing, disappearing, flashing, interacting with my thoughts. I would like to hear more at what elevation did they appear? Were they just light sources? Could you make out like a tangible craft design? Tell us more. I think that's very interesting. Very interesting. Tim Ventura works at all propulsion, APEC works with Mark Sockle, Charles Bueller, Drew Arajima. Yes, I have heard of this, heard of him, but I've never really dove into any of his work. Sorry. How many whistleblowers do you think will appear at the next UAP hearing? Probably right now, I don't have very high hopes for many. I think the 2023 congressional hearings, there were supposed to be two additional whistleblowers that didn't show up. I would hope more, but with whistleblower protection right now in terms of not safeguarding people's pensions, I don't know how many people want to do that. There are too many people who focus on the people more than the content. Yes. I 100% agree. Well put. Falcon was, yes, I believe it was, I believe Falcon was Richard Dodie. Wow, we're just getting to the Grush and JR Retalk. Yeah, he was standoffish with Grush. Joe was kind of just like really laissez-faire with that, kind of relaxed and taken very seriously. Rogan Krabs on Grush and Lou behind their backs, but he blindly defends Lazare. Yeah, it seems like he has a big problem with Grush and then the TTSA crowd. The releasing is not right wing. You asked politics is a mess, a mess. Your video on the private sector should be required viewing for anyone in the community and any conspiracy communities. This is so big. I appreciate that. Thank you. Are you talking Battelle, Lockheed or SAIC? Timbershed recently said that next hearings will likely primarily consist of scientists and more pilots. Yeah. As much as I enjoy hearing about Ryan Graves, we need firsthand testimony of the people that Greer says he's talking to about people who have actually retrieved craft, like he said, who flew him over the Hellendale plant. Rogan is being led by gatekeepers. I wouldn't be surprised. We should deep dive CEO of these companies with special access programs. I bet something surfaces. Someone was, but oh, that reminds me. Greer said his uncle was the Grumman in Northrop Grumman, but that he had no knowledge of UAP situations. I would like to look into CEOs, as well as some head-up scientists. We talked about this last week, but Lockheed Martin and Jim Ryder, as mentioned in Lou Elizondo's book, Eminent. I think there's a lot of interesting people we could study. As well as looking at board of directors of companies and their previous relationships in terms of work on the CIA, because you have Ronald Moultrie, who's on the board of directors for the Carlisle Group. He was a big with Sean Kirkpatrick and so forth. There's a lot of great connections. For me, it was Mark McCandless. I see what you're saying. Mark McCandless broke that ground for you. Mark McCandless's story is excellent. I really want to cover it in full detail and give it the true justice it deserves. David Fraber got me started after that. The testimonies are just impossible to know, both in quality and quantity. Everything else seems like rumors to me, but I still find them interesting. I remember when the Tic Tac case, when Fraber really started talking about his experience on Joe Rogan and so forth, that felt monumental. Real when David Grush came forward and I started researching and here I am. If you were led here by Grush, I couldn't think of anything better. Shining Moment was actually Bob Lazar interview with Rogan. I believe everywhere he says from there, I started exploring rabbit holes. Interesting. Bob Lazar is, of course, so contentious. I love, I could talk about Bob all dang day, all day. Okay. Flying Lotus, if you're still here, is Brainfeeder taking fall interns? I can also text him about that. I know, I will text him about that. I didn't even know this stuff was going on until I saw the Nimitz incident, which Nimitz incident would lead me to the hearing, which made me realize that an experience I had was 100% of UAP. Tell me about it. That's really interesting. You can either tell me about it here in the Discord because I would really like to hear that. McKinnon, let's just filmmaker was poisoned. I forgot. Yeah. Greer said in this, sorry, I'll probably have details about the event come to me. Greer stated that four people he has worked with have been killed. I have not seen evidence for that, but he did state that. He did state that. I was attacked by a Translucent Bean when I was 19 or 20. I was in between sleep and awake and it wasn't a dream. It was like a tentacle pearl Translucent Bean. That sounds horrifying. Horrifying. That sounds very scary. Like in a hypnagogic state almost. Respect your comment on old school research first news of the day. I'm just an old school guy. That's why I like wrestling with people and studying UFOs. Greer is way ahead of Congress. Even he is another level. Greer is way, way ahead of Congress. Even he is another level research. Him. He's. I agree with you, Alan. I don't know what you're saying, but I agree. I met Greer's first time doing DMT. It was expecting machine elves and fractals. It was more real than real. I don't know anything about UFO and Greer lore prior. Now, after getting involved in UFO lore, would you say these Greys that you saw are kind of like the classic depiction of Greys? Me and the homies are all a girl build. I hope everybody is, man. How do I get in contact with these whistleblowers? I would definitely like to do a video of myself on some of these people. Is it because of your following? Not likely. For how I got in contact with Michael, for example, you guys know this. I first got in contact with Joey. Any of the people I've covered, like MSTB, I have gone really far out of my way to contact these people. Discerning the names on the DPI archive has taken anywhere from five minutes with TB to a week to try to find these names. Then, of course, it involves contacting these people, seeing if they'll be willing to talk. I can't tell you how. I have a dozen people who have told me no, not interested. I mean, the name is listed in the archive. I'm going to double check the archive because I don't want to burn the name if it's not there. But there was a doctor that Greer stated had a UAP encounter on a ship, on a Navy ship who a UAP came out of the water, landed nearby and basically destroyed some of the local surroundings just with its landing. In the archives with Greer, this individual also apparently had a point of contact to a former Navy SEAL who was in charge of tracking UAPs coming out of a certain location. I don't know what this location is underwater. I contacted this person. I said, and I will say who the person is next live if I find their name is still in the DPI archive because it's listed out right. But I contacted this person. They're an elderly doctor. And I said, hey, would you be interested in talking about this? I found your name in the DPI archive. They didn't say no, it's not true. They just said, I'm not interested. And kind of a little back and forth with them telling me to kind of get lost. So that was pretty dang interesting to me. Seven days in May, that's it. I was almost, I was almost on it. Almost on it. When I said I wanted your views, it was in reference to whistleblowers you haven't spoken to directly. Oh, okay. Whistleblowers I haven't spoken to directly. Well, I would like to speak to them. I just really enjoy talking to a lot of these people. But there are a lot of prospective whistleblowers I will be trying to contact soon. Large light formation hanging low in the sky. Unbelievable color and formation free. Mental Western Australia in 2005. Tell me more about it. What did this formation do? What color was it and so forth? Have you heard anything about the UAP so big it was presumably buried under something? Of course, TB has spoken about one buried in Seoul, South Korea and his notes. I think there are some people that think that the UAP Ross Colt Hart is referring to that was so big, which I'm certain that you're referring to is in Pine Gap Australia. I have not received any sort of interesting intelligence or kind of investigation on that subject. I know very little about it. I know very little about it, but I just don't even know where to begin researching where that site may be. June Crane is worth a video. Okay. Her statements corroborate. Roswell and her credentials are proven. She had Q clearance. Researcher interviewed is still alive today and is extremely kind. Former LEO. Okay. I will. I would absolutely do that and try and contact that guy. You know, we, we need the Greer and Herrera insider to come forward publicly and end this debate once and for all to expose PLF, Psychotronics used in fake abduction, ARVs, EMW attacks. I completely agree. I think this individual coming forward will, will, would be monumental, especially if this person came forward with evidence. I would like to see that. Literally trying to get bro to the loose and they listen. I don't, I don't do, I don't do, uh, I don't do any substances, but I don't have problems of people do if they're an adult. And that's what they, that's what they choose to do. It's, it's their body, their choice. Uh, man's doesn't look like he needs any more trouble keeping it together. Keep kicking butt. Best show on the topic. I appreciate that man. Much love. Thank you very much. That means the most. Uh, sorry. Greer was telling the truth about Admiral Wilson's briefing documents. He's telling the truth for decades. No one believed him. Doesn't that tell you something? Absolutely. Absolutely. It does Greer. I mean, I think Admiral Wilson even admitted to speaking to Greer, but even when he still denied the, the, sorry, my brain's being scared. Even when he denied the allegations of the Wilson Davis memo being true, but Greer did do that. Yes. That's why I think that is why I took the approach. I did it with Greer's witnesses that they really need to be investigated. The filter. Who has big eyes? Let me know who, let me know who has, who has the big eyes. Like, I'd like to hear about that. Love what you do. Keep the deep eyes. Thank you for training your excellent work. Had some weird results with CE5 over the years, but recommended even if it's just to go stargazing. I would like to hear about this. Absolutely. Please. Mark. Yes. This is important to know about Mark. Mark was an aerospace contractor illustrator. He did a ton of work, a ton of great work. And he also has a lot of interesting points of contact and so forth. Let me get some cold brew. Sorry guys. Remember when Dodie said ETs like straw? Did he? I don't remember him saying that, but I, I don't, I don't, I don't doubt that. Have you had a UAP setting up some kind? Yeah. I talked about this last time. I don't ever really talk about it just because it's, it's not too big of a deal. You know, I think like many people have had experiences just where I've seen these strange lights in the sky, strange formations doing zigzagging in the sky and so forth, but no tangible actual craft or an actual structure I could make out. And I would talk about it more if I had, if I myself had seen the exact body of a saucer or a triangle. The five eyes things makes a lot of sense when you start looking at the way the internet globally, NC and AU are high or handy just based on geography. Absolutely. Absolutely. I also think there's a lot of interesting Australia stuff to, to study. Rogan is skeptical of anything coming from the government to be honest. Chuck Schumer, Hilly Clinton being involved in disclosure is kind of weird. There's evidence Hillary has known something. Yeah. With John Podesta. Absolutely. That is weird. And maybe that ties into what we talked about at the beginning of this live stream where we were talked about first being approached to buy white hats or blue team under the Clinton administration. Who knows? Okay. I was told UAP is hide in our underground aquifer surfacing through connected lakes and streams. They are well hidden. That is, that is very interesting. That is very interesting, especially with stories of UAP kind of appearing from lakes and so forth. That's actually really interesting. I've never heard that. Your spine on your, yeah, that's a good point. Five eyes, five eyes joint intelligence. What are your thoughts on the UFO that is way too big to move? Elizondo was asked about it in a recent interview. We just talked about this. That is from the, I think originally proposed by Ross Colt Hart. I've heard some people say South, South Korea. Some people say Pine Gap Australia. I don't know what that, I don't know what the heck to think. Really Greer is worth researching. The guy is a lot more in the know than anyone else in the field. Chris is life dedicated to this and what's the trauma surgeon? Absolutely. That is why I have dedicated probably two hours of every single day to studying Greer's materials. Absolutely. Greed with all this witness folks on favorite graves. There are so many, many better cases and witnesses out there. I agree. One of those I'd like to see is Mr. TB. Great point mentioning Hellendale radar cross-section facilities. Definitely a place worth keeping an eye on. It was as was the Lockheed Lighthouse in Virginia. Yeah, that's an interesting location to mention. Again, if you weren't here when we talked about the Hellendale site earlier, Greer in his symposium today talked about Hellendale, posted pictures of it, said he was flown over this site, but didn't mention Hellendale. Also checked the DPI archive and found it very strange that all sort of images of Hellendale in reference to Hellendale were kind of taken off the photo site. Greer in graves are such experienced pilots as were the radar operators. Yes. No, I think the balloon. Yeah, those cases are not, especially multi-sensor detection like that. No. What are your thoughts about the Soviet Union UFO cases where UFO above a nuclear silo is activated multiple nuclear ICBMs? Yeah, that's so interesting because of course, in a lot of our cases here, but not AFB, any cases of malabstrom around nuclear arms. It always seems like that the Minutemen missiles or the ICBMs are basically effectively rendered useless and there are Russian cases about them almost being activated. I don't know what to think about that, to be honest. Really don't. I can't remember, I can't prove it, but I remember reading Trump was only briefed on UAP. You're remembering that from Lou and Ross Colthart have both said that. Why would our UAP moderators claim Greer is a charlatan? I had a post removed a while back after sharing a link to one of his documents. I think that's kind of bogus. Sharing Greer documents is kind of wild to just say that's a disinformation or not true. That would be huge. Appreciate it. Been talking with the stones. You've been talking with stones for recently, but brain feed or internship would be a dream. How can I send you my contact info? Either join the Discord. I'll post the link in the here. Sorry. I need to remember how to invite people. I'll post the Discord link in here. Otherwise, UAPGIRB at gmail.com. Here's the Discord link if anybody would like to join. There's been some good discussion today and you can see all my notes as they were from today's presentation. Heaps of short boys. Guys, can you hear me? I think I accidentally just left the live. If anybody can hear me, let me know. Let me know if you can hear me. Okay. I think I'm still live. Somebody let me know, please. Okay. Great. I'm sorry. I accidentally just hit a, I have one of those gaming, gaming mouses. So I actually just backed out. I'm going to try to find out exactly where I was. I'm very sorry for that, guys. Okay. Here we go. Sorry about that, guys. My bad. I went into UAP with three others about 15 years ago. It looked to be a green shooting star. It fell long enough to call attention to it. Then accelerated to a 45 degree England disappeared. That's very interesting, especially with the case I'm covering right now being labeled a meteor until it turned 25 degrees. So that is a, that's really interesting to hear the flying lotus. Yes, flying, flying lotus is a fan of the Gerb channel. And I'm a fan of his music. Excellent music. I'm surprised there hasn't been anyone who takes psychedelics before doing CE5. Because we know the, the P3 people are given a cocktail of drugs before they're what we would call their version of CE5 experience. I wanted to know what I've seen ever since. No idea what it could do. These things I saw it do. I, when you see impossible feats in the sky, there's a very, very strange. Let's go to, is it triangle formation? Okay. You were talking about your UFO sighting triangle formation, triangle light formation above your garden, coming to a sudden stop, changing colors, pulsating, suddenly skipping, flying off into an instant at the speed of a modern day jet. I wonder if that is like a TR3B or some ARV. People love dismissing plant-based contact experience. I think so. Again, I don't have a lot of, I'm pretty uninformed on any sort of psychedelic. So I, my opinion is probably one of the most ill-informed, ill-informed out there. It still amazed me that Schumer Rounds Memo doesn't get more attention because the fact they both pushed for it, yes, especially with 27 mentions of non-human intelligence, the mention of legacy programs, the mention of UAP materials being misclassified under the 1954 atomic energy agreement under transclassified foreign nuclear materials. Let's go. Why should people take abduction cases from their beds seriously? Why take any of this seriously? I think in terms of abduction cases, especially from the bed, the research of John Mack was used just to try and find similarities between, between kind of cases. Anthony, thank you so much for the five bucks. Have I ever looked into the Eiger 1992 video? The detail in the life form makes it hard to debunk. Let me, I feel like I've heard of that. Let me get back to you on that because I feel like I've heard of that video. I can't recall it off the top of my head. I love your logical no clickbait approach. Your channel is massively under subscribed. I appreciate that. I hate clickbait because I grew up before clickbait was a real thing. So back in the day when there'd be videos saying like, oh, don't watch, don't, don't play Minecraft at 3am, warning scary. I, that just puts such a sour taste in my mouth. Kai, thank you. I see it and I can't wait to talk to you about that after watching it. It's sad what happened to Mark. Absolutely. Hey, what's up, Aussie, my Aussie brethren. Nice to see you, man. Why are there so many Democrats involved in disclosure? Interesting question, especially kind of Clinton, Podesta and so forth. Now it's a, hopefully we can continue this issue being a little bit more middle of the aisle. Some of the best UAP contract content out there. I appreciate that man. Seriously, much love. That, that means the most. Um, let's see. Let's get to a video debunking Mick West claims. That would be fun. I see, I leave that to guys like Merrick Von Damic. I can never say his last name. I leave, leave that to men like that who are a little bit more well versed in their claims of counter analyses because I don't have the same analysis skills on sightings and so forth as Merrick does to kind of counter Mick West's claims and so forth. Of course I could when he says stuff just really out of pocket stuff when it comes to kind of, uh, whistleblowers and so forth. That would be, uh, let's see. Hillary wanted disclosure, but Obama got out of the way to comment on UFOs and was making a Betty. That is weird that, uh, that Obama is now producing a Betty and Barney Hill documentary. I haven't heard any update on that. If you, I first met Greer in the nineties in Pensacola, Florida at Sacred Heart Hospital. He, he was a trauma surgeon at, uh, at Sacred Heart, right? I think that's where he was. Now the Illuminati in contact with the bad end at H.I. And the ones being shot down are the good guys. I don't know. Of course I've heard of interfactionality of NHIs and ETs, but I'm not sure to which, to what extent that goes. And of course you listened to David Grush talk about agreements with NHI. I'm not sure, uh, what agreements have been made with whom. Police chiefs across the U.S. have issued the first official. That's very interesting. Ross Colard posted that last week providing law enforcement, uh, enforcement officers with instructions on how to report and respond. Yes, that's great. I'll link that in the discord because that's a, that's a really good document. But from what I hear right when presidents are disproportionately briefed as there's a strong presence of fascist and or religious fundamentalists such as Collins Leighton, the program. I've heard that too. Especially of interest being briefed who I think is a little overlooked is Lyndon B. Johnson. I'll give you guys a little tasty treat right here. Um, Lyndon B. Johnson, you guys remember my video on Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who talked about Dr. Eric Walker being involved in UFO crash retrieval since the early 1950s with Vannevar Bush. Robert Sarbacher also self admitted that he was part of UAP, uh, collection efforts as well as knew what the majestic 12 was as well as said he was himself present at the Kecksburg UFO crash in 1965. Well, Dr. Eric Walker and Lyndon B. Johnson had a very close correspondence where they would say send each other very personal letters. So that's really interesting to see a link between those two. Uh, what do I think of the eye? I saw the image, but I never investigated further. Uh, maybe I will sometime, but there was just so much, uh, so much, there's just always so much going on so many cases to look at. Uh, Edgar Mitchell spoke about this. Edgar Mitchell and, uh, uh, Gordon Cooper. Very interesting guys. What's up awakening to reality? How you doing, bro? How you doing? Loud and clear. Okay. I think this is when I just got back. If the feds got me, I'll go kicking and screaming, man. I'll go kicking and screaming. Hey, Jorgen, thank you for the 119 Norwegian Krona. How far back do you believe IC has investigated infiltrated the phenomena? An example did O and I cover the Aurora incident. That's a great question. I'd say at least 1933. Um, the Aurora incident, I think is a case that really warrants a lot of investigation, especially due to some of the circumstantial, not really evidence, but, uh, circumstantial details of the case being really interesting, such as. The idea that some of the craft parts were thrown down a well, which poisoned local residents and so forth. Possibly before then, but I think maybe the earliest we could go is maybe 1897 with the Aurora incident. But thank you again, man. I really appreciate that. What do you think about the UAP tether incident? I knew you did a video on fast workers, but I don't remember if you covered that incident. I don't think I did cover that incident. Now I would actually like to cover the UAP tether incident. Doing yourself a disservice by, uh, contact experiences, maybe look at the content of the experience for you right off as. Okay. I think you might be talking to somebody else. I, because I, I'm just not, not acknowledgeable. Awaken into reality. Thank you so much for the 899, uh, New Zealand dollars. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that, man. The Eiger 1992 alien video is fake. Tristan, I will have to, I absolutely have to watch that. I think Democrat leaders are cock blocked from being briefed on the UFO compared to GOP since they may have balls. Honestly, to further disclose if they get too much information, they're risky. That could be a valid point. I like that hypothesis. Interesting research done at Imperial College in London where different DMTs were used to map out the space. Oh, that is interesting to map out like a, uh, basically create a map of the space. Hey, uh, I got, let me, let me go off on a quick tangent here, guys. Cause I probably won't get to this question about five minutes for any of my gamers in the chat. Have any of you guys played the new war hammer space marines two game? I know I'll get to those questions in about five minutes, but I would like to read if anybody has, has read them. Uh, Von Rennen camp. That's it. He just appeared on a Ross Colt part and yes, I, I can't pronounce stuff. I, I just can't. Did you watch Tom Begert and psychotronics lecture on how to achieve anti-gravity free energy? No, I have not yet. I still need to, I have been consumed with the case I'm working on right now. And that is because it is a 23 page script. So it took me a heck of a long time. Who are the world's best known living intellectual living intellectuals and public speakers? Where are their comments on the phenomenon? Uh, good question. We could go with guys like Sir Roger Penrose and so forth. Some best known living intellectuals. I don't think a lot of them have really, uh, spoken on, on the phenomenon. John Doe. What's going on, brother? Do you believe the skinny Bob alien video? I try and stay away from that until there's, uh, a lot of the topics that have just kind of an endless debate. I try and stay away from just because if my research, if not a lot of research has been advanced on something and maybe my research is just going to get caught in the same loop. Um, I might just kind of wait a little bit until I have something, some actionable information to pursue on, on stuff. And I do not on skinny Bob right now. As a youngster, I loved watching the dang video. I'll tell you that much. America is afraid of the phenomenon is communist Nazi, but they're becoming what they sought to destroy. It's 40 chairs. Absolutely in the cold war and so forth. We absolutely were. Absolutely. It goes all the way back to, uh, project paperclip and Alan Dole's. Yes. Alan Dole is in, uh, the 1933 magenta crash. The door's old boys. Claudio, thank you so much for the 499. My apologies. Donation for going off topic about internships and chat. Keep it up. You and Jesse Michaels be such a good convo. No problem, man. This chat's open to anybody. We're not going to restrict anything. Anybody says, but I really appreciate that. Thank you very much. Twist UAP Leonard Stringfield was one of the best UFO crash researchers. If true, his info is mind blowing. I'd like to take a second and I know I say this in every single video. And in my upcoming video, I will talk about Stringfield at length, but Stringfield is the best of the best. The UFO crash retrievals parts one through seven are sublime. That is what I will stand by as the best ever work done on the subject in terms of crash retrievals. It is phenomenal sublime. Leonard Stringfield is the best. One of my personal dreams is to be able to access his personal records at Mufon Cincinnati, sit with a, with a cold brew for 12 hours and read every single note he ever took. The tether video is wild. Yes. The Cabal's goal is full spectrum of dominance as they say in official documents to achieve that they need the whole world to unite around fear. Perfect way to do that is through a fake ET invasion, or as David Gresh would say, a feudalistic dominance. And, and I agree. I'm still, I still have my problems with, with paper clip or the, I'm sorry, the idea of project blue beam and so forth, but I do understand that point. I do think the, I think the unbearable truth of the phenomenon might be that there's an afterlife for everyone and the unbearable part is where the world collapses due to people self-checking out. I think that was explored in a movie, right? With Jason Seagal. I don't think it was very good, but I think that concept was explored. What would people do if they learned they had an afterlife? That's an interesting idea. Oh, no, no worries with a, no worries with spam. Mrs. Floyd, thank you very much. Yes. There's a lot of Norwegians here. Somebody even recognized the front line shirt, which is great. The Danny Cheehan interview on Jesse Michaels American Alchemy show is amazing. If anyone hasn't watched it, you watch, watch anything by Jesse Michaels. Jesse Michaels is amazing and he has some really cool projects and the work that I think you guys are really going to like. Jesse Michaels is the real deal. Have I played No Man's Sky? One of the best, if not the best space games out there. Yeah. I've played, I've played, I've done like four different playthroughs of it. I love it. There's nothing like having a nice crisp diet cola night and just flying through on your new S-class ship. I love it. Best thing I ate in Japan, that would probably have to be, um, yukatsu. Yukatsu steak where you have steak cooked lightly, lightly fried on the outside with, um, cooked to a rare medium rare and you're given like a hot plate basically to sear it how you want yourself to then dip it in the various sauces. It was sublime. One of the best things I've ever eaten. I feel like right wing presidents would be far more likely to disclose. Conservatives are way, way more wary of big government and government outreach. I agree, but do presidents have the ability to disclose? Penrose is the goat. Absolutely. Physics goat. SDS, 114 UFO video in space is weird. It makes a U-turn. One of the weirdest space. Yeah. I think I put that in the fast walker video. It's a very strange, strange video. If we created simulated realities like video games, why wouldn't the beans above us not do the same? I agree. Sorry. You get a sip of water. Yeah. I agree. I think, um, I can't remember what podcast it was, but there's a man who did a podcast on simulation theory. And one of those was with the ability to simulate. There will be an endless amount of simulations. And we thus have a greater probability of being one of said simulations. But by whom? I don't know. David of Salem. My contact experience was a possible one. They seemed to take it back that I could see them as I was. It was like we abducted each other rather than mine. I think I've heard that in some abduction cases of, of beans almost being surprised that they were, they have been noticed. Cheers from Norway. Cheers to you. I hope to be back to, to Norway soon, man. I love that some Norwegians watch, watch this channel. It's, um, thoughts on the tall whites. The tall whites are interesting. Um, of course, with many gray sightings of abductees and so forth, there's a lot of the time like a tall white, as some people say, like venusians, mantis type beans alongside the, the gray, the drones. I don't know what to think because abductions isn't really my bread and butter. I still am just trying to investigate what the heck are some of the bodies that are discovered at some of the crash sites. Phil Snyder, we talked about this before. Some of his claims are, are very interesting. They're very big too. His claims are very big. And, uh, in terms of getting into a firefight underground with NHI where soldiers were basically turned to goop, uh, alongside him. But I have, I'm, I'm probably would start with researching his death if I do, if I do some research into him. The skinny Bob looks like CGI to me, but I want to believe that one. It does. It looks a little buttery. It looks a little buttery. Hey, dude, I hope the Browns lose because the bangles got beat by one of the worst teams in the NFL today. And I'm very upset. We're skyfire, skyfire news. I'm not quite sure. I am not quite sure. Matilda O'Donnell Roswell interview mentioned a gray, didn't know English till I read the book that night and they were, uh, over the White House. Yeah. And what they, what were they over the White House? Um, a lot of Roswell witnesses, including the, um, including the photographer at Roswell mentioned grays. They are forced for peace and nuclear disarmament. They try and promote a message of peace. They could have various effects on electronics on off. Yeah. Kevin Knuth at his soul foundation, uh, did a lot of interesting talk about this with electric fields and magnetic fields of UAP and they're interacting with technology and so forth. Okay. Sorry. Project blue beam is disinformation. I tend to lead towards this too. It was made up by Dottie. I didn't know that. Um, I blue beam, at least in my experience has been used by people I know who want to discount, um, UFOs. And I know in that comment, I said, like, I could understand, uh, the utilizing of a invasion for fear, but I still think that that is mainly based off of Reagan's Reagan speech and, uh, disinformation. If skinny Bob is faked is incredibly well done. When I met them, they looked just like that. Interesting. Convincing for so long. That's a good point. It could only be, uh, it could only be for convincing as long as the holograms could, could stay up in the, in the air. Um, maybe, uh, the weird after effects on skinny Bob. I've heard of those. It was any Jacobson that said the Roswell crash was rushing towards and Dottie to an unacknowledged of Greer. But I think, uh, uh, any Jacobson said that recently on her Sean Ryan appearance, I think it was, and she was on, uh, Jerry, Jonathan Reed footage. Uh, listen, I heard of Jonathan Reed a long time ago on mysterious universe. If you guys know, uh, that podcast, it's great. And his story was, I think a lot of, I almost posited. This is Jonathan Reed story because of the NHI body. Jonathan Reed claims to have a, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, because if I am, I'll retract my statement right away. But Jonathan Reed claims to have slain a, uh, a, a creature that, that creature he has photographed with a samurai sword. I believe that's what he said and then put it on nice. Uh, and also the photos of the wedge shaped craft are very weirdly proportioned, very weirdly proportioned. Uh, so many good videos ruined with crap editing. Yeah. I tend to agree. I tend to agree. I held Roswell foil to it heats when flame took the same as cutting metal holding the hand. You held Roswell material. I would like to hear, I would like to hear more about that. What's the best thing I ate at a gas station in Norway and did you get it? Or what's the best thing you ate in Norway and did you eat at a gas station for all my Norwegians out there? You will know what a hot dog on Lumpa is. And that's like a Norwegian bread tortilla that gas stations, but hot dogs on it. And then they're so good. They're amazing. They are amazing. Also wanted to tell you about two picks of alleged dead aliens I saw. They reminded me of one from EBEs described in the MJ 12 manual, the non gray ones will send them on discord. I would love to, I would excuse me. I would love to see that please. Did you see the video of the UFO in orbit that gets shot up by some weapon? Yeah. Like the kind of like light beam. Yes, I have seen that. And I don't know what to make of it because I haven't spent too much time looking at it. I think it was, it was in not lost century. Was it in unacknowledged? Take a look at UAP Gerb's eyes. He is a Pleiadian alien. That'd be cool, man. I wish I was. If I was, I'd be the first to tell you, but I am just a human. I would like to see the original skinny Bob video. I wonder where that has obviously been cropped down. I would like to as well, but it with a, with those videos, this just, at least for me, I couldn't come to a conclusion. So it'd be difficult for me to engage thoughts on the tall whites. Very interesting to me. I'm still trying to start out what the heck kind of the graves or the small creatures, the EBE type ones and twos are. And then we will get to the kind of description of the mantis type beings or the tall, tall graves or venusians and so forth. The problem with new wave of UFO experts is they don't understand the science of free energy, anti-gravity. They could easily be deceived. Any saucer that attacks us would be considered ET. I do agree that a lot of new wave UFO folks don't necessarily understand the physics behind UAP and kind of ARV. I certainly don't. I'll be the first to admit that physics is never, never my strong suit. The book identifies companies and crafts still secret. Bob Dean had the book in foil 1988 England. I think the whole bad abduction versus good abduction experience is similar to having good versus bad trips on psychedelics. That's an, that is an interesting point. I believe most abductions in beds are most likely sleep paralysis. I have heard this too. Again, I like, I don't want to discount anyone's abduction experience. So I don't know what the heck to think, but they very well could be sleep paralysis. Las Vegas alien video. I don't think anything ever came of that. Right. I think Steven Dean or Steven donor on Twitter said he had was interviewing the person who took that footage. Right. But I don't think anything ever came of that. If I'm, if I'm remembering correctly, I stayed far away from that in the Miami mall stuff. Um, just wasn't not, not the sort of case I, I'd be investigating world of the world's movie is similar to the event where people were attacked and have blood drawn. Yeah. The world of the world's the Tom Cruise version that came out in 2005 scared the crap out of me as a little kid that scared me so bad. What's the best publicly available UFO video you've seen? Um, that's a tough one just because I've kind of moved so far away from videos. I'd say right now it's probably the video of the, the triangle I always post. I can't remember exactly where that video was taken, but late at night triangle with three points of light on each vertex with one red light in the middle. I think that's a fantastic video. Fantastic. The whole invasion. Yeah. I agree with this. I've said this before that the only, uh, blue beam claims are to point to, uh, to Reagan speech when he addressed the UN and said, I can't think of how quickly, uh, the world would come together with the threat of an alien invasion. Yeah. Okay. So this is with, uh, Jonathan Reed and the samurai sword. Yeah. That's been conveniently left out with a read story of a wedge kind of coming back and being popular with, with loose book in the description of the wedge shaped craft. He did say he sl, he slayed the, the creature with a samurai sword. Reply to abduction comment. You can go on board the craft by a telepathic mind link via unseen plane of existence out of body consciousness. The same way ETs talk to people telepathically with the utilization of P three assets. I wouldn't be surprised. He used a big branch. Ah, okay. Maybe I was wrong about the sword, but he still slayed it with a club. Still slayed it with a club. Do I think I would look at some of John max abduction cases? Absolutely. I'd like to tackle the abduction phenomena. It's just, there's so much to do. So I really need to make sure we get in at a good time to, to focus fully on the abduction phenomena. The read teleportation video is whack, big whack. Yeah. I've seen it and I'll watch it again and I'll keep watching it, but there's a little whack. Project blue beam was not made by Dodie and disinfo usaps won't just use holograms. They'll use ARVs PLC. I think, yeah, this is, this is what a career would state, right? Especially with, with this TE or ET, I can't quite remember and the fake, the PLF abduction he occurred when he left the Nellis retrieval team. Chevrolet being locking Martin naps built a cannabis and blue book wonder if Hitler had them before the reverse engineering. I don't know. I had a, a good friend asked me earlier about a kind of Nazis and UAP reverse engineering. And besides hunt for his zero point and the stories of deep lock, I really haven't spent too much time, too much time researching. Well, Grush's op-ed come out this year. I truly hope so. I truly hope so. Will it be, is it still stuck in Dobser? I'm not quite sure. Now Grush is definitely not, not being lazy. I definitely think he is doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but I truly hope so. If the teleportation video didn't exist, the alien body would have to be significantly more credible. Unfortunately, dude decided to write a weird hype train to nowhere. Yes. Have you seen the Sentinel Arizona footage recorded by Nick Williams? I don't think so, but I would like to see that. That was a ET UFO being shot with scalar waves and EM system weapons. That's the situation for almost a century. Yes. I have, I have heard that as well. And I'm, I'm coming to start to really, really seriously research that topic of, of scalar weapons and kind of what Greer sets about targeting craft. Plasma propulsion, MHD plasma. If I'm being correct, I think Oak Shannon has some notes on this that operate in like the 3.5 gigahertz range, creates a cloud, which they use as camouflage and to cool down the craft. Now what I have heard is that early types of ARVs used MHD Plasma Stopper Pulsion when later configurations have used actual like anti-gravity techniques. Do I have anything to back that up or any evidence or research that? No, but I've heard that before. MH370, I think we'll probably stay away from, from MH370 on the channel. I think it's just a, it's very toxic, toxic subject at the moment. Oh yeah. Reed stated his dog was turned to ash. That also reminds me of the 1950s Maori incident where I think a saucer discharged material. I can't remember if that case was labeled as a hoax or not or found to be, but where material allegedly hit a dog. Any update on Jesse, you and Jesse Michaels collaborating. I will be meeting Jesse tomorrow or Tuesday. I'm not quite sure which day yet and I will have an update then. What about the phenomena? Would you like to research the most aside from UAP, psionics, remote viewing? So that's tough because crash retrieval and reverse engineering are what I like the most. At this point, I'd probably like to go down and I'll say, I'll throw in ARVs. I can't throw ARVs in there as well because I want to research that. And I'll, I'll take, I want to research dumps, deep underground military bases. Oh, that green footage, but that footage is really cool too with the triangle scene from almost kind of height level. Yeah, that's a great, that's a, that's like a great video. But you remember, there's like a ball of light in the middle that I think expands. And like, I think I'm, I think that's the video you're talking about. Let me know if, let me know if I'm right here. I could be wrong, but I think that's the video you're talking about, the green one. Trying to get my GF into the subject and watch the first minute black last night had some interesting themes in it. The first minute black is a fantastic film. I really want to rewatch that with the lady. It's a fantastic film. And guys, I'll get through these questions maybe in about 10 minutes. I'll have to hop off, but we'll get through all of these. I promise meeting Bob Dean and after holding Roswell foil and saw pages of a few pages of blue. But remember who has gone for 20 years. The foil stretches like a razor. I cut myself. I don't remember that. Now I'd like to hear how, how did you get your hands on, on, on said foil? And what have there been research done on this specific, specific piece you held? What's up, Zach? How you doing rewatch? Yes. I highly recommend starting from beginning right now. We're just chatting answering questions, but earlier we, we went through the entire gray or talk today. I bought the pay-per-view. So you didn't have to. And we kind of, I took screenshots of every single PowerPoint slide and we went through the whole dang thing. The whole thing. Have you watched the recent weaponized with Corbel? They discussed an event in 2000 where people were attacked by UFOs that took blood from them and shine beams. That's not the color. That's not the Brazil instead. Right. I haven't listened to weaponized in a while, but I would like to listen to that. That's Brazil. Correct. Yeah. I haven't, I don't think since the start of the year I've listened and listened to weaponized. Oh, the turkey video. Yeah. With Chris Leto back in the day, did a great video actually like identifying the angle at which this video was recorded, the position where it was recorded. I highly recommend checking that out. It's an old Chris Leto video. I think from early 2023 mid 2023, it's fantastic. Are they among us like big low suggests? Quite possibly. Do I have any research or evidence to back that up or have an informed opinion? No. Do not do a video on the clock. I'd like to, of course it, uh, the clock. There's a lot of relation to the Kecksburg case in terms of general design. I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to include that in the Kecksburg case or make a video on its own about the Glock. We met photons and radiation, uh, probably into the stratosphere. Craft would redirect the brain waves. Possibly. Sentinel footage. Um, Chloris Brazil. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking the same thing, the Chloris Brazil incident. And I think that, uh, I got popular again because Lou spoke about it in his book. Right. Um, was it Lou? I believe so. It's a great movie. MIB one, especially when the face opens and the little alien is revealed. Yeah. That's a classic. The tiny little alien MIB ones. Great. It scared me really bad when I was a child though. Jacques Valet and forbidden science for, um, has secured a document confirming the CIA performed fake alien abductions in Argentina and Brazil for psychological work. I would really like to see this document if you have that. I've, I've never seen it. Um, I'll put the discord link in here again. I know I'll put it twice, but I would actually really like to read that document. Please. If you have it on hand, otherwise I have a copy of forbidden science for it. I'll just find it. They must see in UV light reaction times more like it. Let's see. They're seen. Let's see. What are the consequences of the Collins elite are correct in their findings and the phenomenon is largely your entirely demonic. The consequences of that are just awful. That means we, uh, that mean, I don't even want to face the, the, the consequences of the UAP phenomenon being a demonic. That is almost too terrifying for a man like myself to think about, but very, very bad consequences. If that's the truth, David favor said that he was part of a big upcoming UFO documentary, not James Fox's. I have heard that supposedly coming out soon. And he said it was very interesting. There was some podcasts with Ryan graves. I heard that as well. There's also a Bob Lazar documentary coming out. Of course the program with James Fox is coming out. I think everybody in their grandmother is looking forward to that one and Jesse Michaels saw it. So if Jesse Michaels can give me any deets, I can share with you guys, I absolutely will. Maybe an ongoing YouTube playlist of the best craft videos people have ever captured would be a cool thing. That would be cool. Yeah. Actually, cause I know I include a lot of craft sightings as B role, but like a full video would be great. I've seen a triangle UAP it's he man made. What signified that I would actually like to hear that. Do I watch UAP content or only research it for YouTube? I do not really watch. Here's the thing. I don't watch UAP content because I'm always reading a UAP book. Every second of every night and day doing the UAP book or just taking a endless amount of notes on on a sightings or projects I'm working on. So it's I need a little bit of a break at that time. So I don't consume too much UAP content. I'll I'll watch YouTube for for dumb stuff like maybe some games or stuff like that. I was at my friend's house after school and Bob Dean was a friend of his. Wow. That's incredible. That's very cool. Yo, what up JC? What up, dude? There are metamaterials which go through plasma excitation become room temp semiconductors on a quantum scale and defy gravity. I'll join discord and send some links. Please do. I'd like to learn more. If you can help teach me. Absolutely. Please. I'd like to learn and if you're willing to help please William. What's up, dude? You made my day for showing up. Thanks, man. Christian Morales. You missed quite a bit. I would highly recommend going back to the very beginning of the video because for the first hour and 20 minutes we talked solely about Greer's presentation today in London. I took screenshots of everything and we discussed everything in it. So there's a lot there to look at. Gryffindor Beatles. There's one of it doing 900 miles and our people might be real sciences. Interesting. Cows would call us demonic, right? Probably. Yes. Why do you think Lula as honest as Big Lowe is an American hero when it seems to me he is doing the exact same thing as the legacy program. Specifically he takes in all the info and uses it for wealth. Yeah, that's true, especially with Kona Blue. Who knows if Big Lowe Aerospace was actually going to share the materials it was supposed to receive from Lockheed Martin. I don't know why. Some of the stuff with the TTSA crew is a little strange to me, especially Big Lowe Aerospace. You guys know how Greer gets shepherded by Rand Pandolfi? I do not and I would like to hear. Have you ever considered seismic data to quantify triangulate known crash sites? I have your research, Mr. Floyd, but I have not gone through that yet, but I think that's a very good route to go down. I know the current case I'm working on, Kecksburg, has recorded seismic data. I don't have the actual data, but it was referenced in the Blue Book report on the case. So I actually think that's very worthwhile. That's a great research avenue. Project Gravitar should be entertaining, aesthetically pleasing if nothing else. This is the Badozzar documentary with a full VR recreation of the sports model to explore digitally, which is awesome. That's going to be really cool. At what age did you get hooked on the UFO topic and why, since I could read? I've said this a lot, but ever since I was able to read, I had some UFO sightings books specifically mentioned of Betty and Barney Hill. I remember reading about that case from a very young age, and I've just always been incredibly fascinated with the phenomenon. Okay, we'll get through these and then in a couple of minutes we'll hit the road gang, headed to the weird desk after Kit Green, Pandolfi is dangerous and has imitated and scared a lot of people. He shepherds Greer because Greer is so controversial, it helps the gatekeepers. Interesting. I'll have to do some more research on that, absolutely. One thing that stumps me about the whole triangle being man-made Arabies, why TF are they flying them at Low Altitude or Highway so everyone can see it makes no sense? Yes, that's actually a great question. So many people who talk about having triangle sightings talk about these being observed over such low altitudes, hundreds of feet. In the interest of not wanting to be seen, that seems very strange. It's also strange how triangular sightings don't really pop up until the 1950s. Bob Lazar said the sports model is a Hanoubi MK4, the fastest craft, Lazar don't say Hanoubi. I didn't know that. What do you think of the new Aero director? I know he's in league with Jay Stratton. I know he also made some rather silly comments on LinkedIn as his first act of Aero director. With Aero, we're not going to get anything different. It's going to be more of the same, probably. Gerb said that if the Trump wins, he will release good picks of UFOs. I know he said that, but is he going to be able to declassify them? Chris Mellon, David Grosh, Lousano have all talked about 4K UFO footage presumably taken from the NRO that is classified and will not be released. I definitely take that with a grain of salt, but I would love that. Will I ever make a video about the UFO in your profile picture? Yes, the Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Saucer sightings? Yes, I would. That's probably the one photo set I'd make a video on, just because it's so fascinating. Big Lowe seems like he hardly cares about disclosure, he has a ton of info, but doesn't care to reveal what it is. I agree. He seems to be more just doing consciousness after death studies and more passion projects. He doesn't seem well vested in disclosure. Magic Book was MI5 and MI6.IF. Does everything go to Royal Air Force bases too? I don't know. That's actually a good question. Besides the witness we talked about in Greer's stuff earlier, BK, I'm actually not familiar with any UK bases that might be a place in which crash retrievals, biologics maybe, store it. I got hooked on the UFO subject when I seen three UFOs flying doing strange maneuvers in Lithuania in the early 2000s. Love the content, keep it up. Thank you, man. Thank you very much. Three UFOs doing strange maneuvers. What kind of maneuvers? That sounds fascinating. Opinions on Green Street. We talked about this earlier, and I think I probably talk about this every episode. I think he has some sort of Department of Defense Pentagon ties. He also seems like a guy who got burned that is trying to take revenge on UFO players. There's something to be said about the fact he includes the phrase spooky alien space monsters and 8 out of 10 tweets he does. I'm not the biggest fan of Green Street. Before 2017, Greer used to always say that one day they'll do a fake disclosure. They'll start saying UFOs are a threat happening in 2017, happening now in another coincidence. This probably parallels with the fact that Greer has a huge beef with Lou, which we talked about a little bit earlier, but yeah, those are probably direct connections. Tier 3B triangular, but around Hanubi would glow triangle balls with a cube to steer magnets. Interesting, cube, sort of like the cube within a sphere like Greer speaks about. A president has no power to bring disclosure because of the Atomic Energy Act. The app trans classified as foreign nuclear materials, and there's an Obama classification. I can't remember what classification. Executive order, I can't remember what it was called. I'll post it in the Discord, but that there's a mandatory aversion to declassification with anything dealing with non-human technologies, which could reference NHI or AI or both. Bigelow isn't about disclosure, but he's seen some disturbing stuff. Man, his wife was allegedly killed to the hitchhiker effect. Interesting, I have not pursued his wife's death. That is really interesting. Yeah, the same. I had no idea. I've seen the moon disappear and pop up in a different place. That is interesting. Here's the link. Okay, thank you. I'll check that out, my man. My step-granddad posted Magic 12 to MJ12 in the 90s, but book was all black inked. So your granddad had in hands a Magic 12 book, but that was heavily redacted. That is interesting. I would like to hear more. You should check out Soccer 96. They're super into the topic and have a track with Salami Rose. Absolutely, that sounds great. Anybody I can look into more. Guys, at this point, we will take some time to sign off. We've been doing this for about two and a half hours. Like I said, we'll be doing a stream of just about every Sunday, maybe every Monday. Whenever there's a big event like this, Greer stuff, I will always kind of use the live to cover it, do that for a video for a live instead of just kind of research because I like my videos to be huge research projects. And with that, guys, yeah, with that big low statement about his wife, if anybody's in the Discord, we'll continue to talk about it there. With that, guys, I want to say I really appreciate the support on the channel. Thank you guys so much for showing up, watching this to our live stream. I know Kai, I know something or someone have kind of been here since the very start. So I really appreciate everyone being here and expect a new video this week. I'm hoping to get it done. I was hoping to get it done today, but it might be Wednesday. We get it out just because it got some stuff going on with Jesse. It's going to be a bit of a busy week. So we'll get that video out and then some some other stuff in the work. Thank you guys all so much for showing up to the stream and I will catch everybody later. All right, see you guys.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/3iWLTyhdyf4/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Alan</li> <li>Alan Dole</li> <li>Alan Dole's</li> <li>Albert Stubblebine</li> <li>Albert Stubblebine Greer</li> <li>Alex Jones</li> <li>Alexander</li> <li>Anthony</li> <li>Arrest</li> <li>Aurora</li> <li>Aussie</li> <li>Baker</li> <li>Barney Hill</li> <li>Beetlejuice</li> <li>Big Lowe</li> <li>Bigelow</li> <li>Bob</li> <li>Bob Dean</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Bradley</li> <li>Brainfeeder</li> <li>Browns</li> <li>Charles Bueller</li> <li>Chloris Brazil</li> <li>Chris</li> <li>Chris Leto</li> <li>Chris Mellon</li> <li>Christian Morales</li> <li>Chuck Schumer</li> <li>Cinder Cone</li> <li>Claudio</li> <li>Clinton</li> <li>Collins</li> <li>Colt Hart</li> <li>Corbel</li> <li>Corso</li> <li>Crackerjack</li> <li>Danny Cheehan</li> <li>David</li> <li>David Fraber</li> <li>David Gresh</li> <li>David Grosh</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>Denise McKenzie</li> <li>Django</li> <li>Dobser</li> <li>Dottie</li> <li>Doty</li> <li>Doug</li> <li>Drew Arajima</li> <li>Dugway German</li> <li>Eddie Bravo</li> <li>Edgar Mitchell</li> <li>Eiger</li> <li>Eric Davis</li> <li>Eric Walker</li> <li>Eugene Kelly Jr.</li> <li>Event Horizon</li> <li>Floyd</li> <li>Fluxliner</li> <li>Fort Huachuca</li> <li>Fraber</li> <li>Freedward Winterberg</li> <li>Freeman</li> <li>George</li> <li>Gerb</li> <li>Gluten</li> <li>Gordon Cooper</li> <li>Greer</li> <li>Greer States</li> <li>Greys</li> <li>Grush</li> <li>Gryffindor Beatles</li> <li>Hanoubi</li> <li>Harold Malmgren</li> <li>Harry Drew</li> <li>Harry Drew's</li> <li>Harry Reid</li> <li>Hillary</li> <li>Hilly Clinton</li> <li>Hitler</li> <li>IC</li> <li>Implementing</li> <li>JC</li> <li>JR Retalk</li> <li>Jack Ramanson's</li> <li>Jacobson</li> <li>Jacques Valet</li> <li>Jacques Villiers</li> <li>James Fox</li> <li>James Fox's</li> <li>James Rigney</li> <li>Janet</li> <li>Jason Sands</li> <li>Jason Seagal</li> <li>Jay Stratton</li> <li>Jean Mack</li> <li>Jeremy Corbell</li> <li>Jerry</li> <li>Jesse</li> <li>Jesse Michaels</li> <li>Jesse Michaels American Alchemy</li> <li>Jim Ryder</li> <li>Joe</li> <li>Joe Rogan</li> <li>Joe Rogan's</li> <li>Joey</li> <li>John</li> <li>John B.

Throughout American and world history, there are numerous encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails and eyewitnesses. Today, we investigate one of these encounters that occurred during the mass UFO wave of 1952 to 1954. Let's travel to the night of May 20th, 1953, to a small town situated between Hualapa Valley and the Servant Mountain Range called Kingman, Arizona, where something perplexing and inexplicable crashed into the desert. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb. Today, I want to dive into the story of one of my all-time favorite alleged crash retrievals, the 1953 Kingman, Arizona UFO crash. This story is massively overshadowed by the Roswells of the world, yet features two extremely credible witnesses and surprising connections to our usual suspects, the AEC and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Is this crash fact or fiction? Well guys, we will do our very best to find out. The story of the Kingman crash first surfaced publicly in 1973, five years before Jesse Marcel famously told Stanton Freeman he was a part of the Roswell cover-up in order to pose with fake wreckage comprised of balsa wood and aluminum foil while the crash disc was secretly whisked away. In 1973, UFO researcher Raymond Fowler revealed shocking statements made and sworn into affidavit by a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base engineer and USAF project engineer on Operation Upshot Not Whole under the pseudonym Fritz Warner. And before we get into the story, what is this weird name Upshot Not Whole? This was a series of 11 nuclear test shots conducted in early 1953 at the Nevada Proving Ground, orchestrated by none other than the Atomic Energy Commission. The objective of this project was to utilize tactical nuclear weapons to ready the US military for atomic combat. These tests even oversaw a nuclear payload shot out of artillery cannons. An estimated 18 to 21,000 DOD personnel participated in this program in 1953. Anyways, back to Warner, let's hear his story. Warner stated to Fowler he was an engineer on USAF contract with the AEC for Operation Upshot Not Whole. His job was to measure blast effects on various types of buildings constructed for the tests. On May 20, 1953, Fitz spent most of the day at Frenchman Flat. Dr. Ed Dahl telephoned Warner that evening he would be doing a special job the following day. Joined by 15 other AEC specialists, Warner reported to Indian Springs Air Force Base. There he was put on a plane to Phoenix with all of his valuables left in the custody of the military police and eventually placed on a bus with blacked out windows. During the four hour ride, an Air Force Colonel told the personnel a super secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and these specialists were sent in to investigate their speciality and theirs only. When he finally got off the bus, Fitz observed two agonizingly bright spotlights centered on a crashed object surrounded by guards. In Fitz's own words, quote, the object was oval and looked like two deep saucers. One inverted upon the other. It was about 30 feet in diameter with convex surfaces top and bottom. These surfaces were about 20 feet in diameter. Part of the object had sunk into the ground. It was constructed of a dull silver metal like brushed aluminum. The metal was darker where the saucer lips formed a rim around which were what looked like slots. A curved open hatch door was located on the leading end and was vertically lowered. There was a light coming from inside but it could have been installed by the Air Force, end quote. Warner's duty was to attempt to determine the angle from which the object impacted into the sand and how fast the vehicle was moving with forward and vertical velocities at the time. The craft had sunk roughly 20 inches into the sand and featured no landing gear and shockingly no damage. No marks or dents on the surface not even scratches. Over time Fitz estimated the craft had been traveling at roughly 1200 miles per hour and amazingly Fitz claimed to glance at a guarded pitch tent where lied the body of a dead pilot. It appeared to be a four foot tall humanoid biologic with dark brown skin and a silvery metallic looking suit. Keep this pilot description in mind. After being interviewed on his crash velocity estimations over a tape recorder, Fitz managed to speak to someone who claimed to have glanced inside the craft and observed two swivel like seats as well as numerous strange and anomalous instruments in displays. Fitz finally returned to the bus and headed back to Phoenix. The Air Force Colonel had all 16 AEC personnel swear an oath not to reveal their findings and were instructed to write their reports longhand and to not type or reproduce. There is Warner's story truly fantastic and difficult to conceptualize under just a simple pseudonym right? Well what if I told you the enigmatic Fitz Warner's identity has been revealed but first quickly let's first review the affidavits signed by Fitz with Raymond Fowler as witness. This excerpt of the affidavit is from Fowler's book Casebook of a UFO Investigator under the section Crash Retrievals of the Third Kind. I, Fritz Warner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with the U.S. Air Force on May 21st, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a crashed unknown object in the vicinity of Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembled brushed aluminum. It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign of structural damage. It was oval and about 30 feet in diameter. An entranceway hatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was about three and a half feet high and one and a half feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with someone on the team who did get a look inside only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin, and a lot of instrumentation and display. A tent pitch near the object sheltered the dead remains of the only occupant of the craft. It was about four feet tall, dark brown complexion, and had two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, and a small round mouth. It was closed in a silvery metallic suit and wore a skullcap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering her helmet. I certify that the above statement is true of fixing my signature to this document on this day of June 7, 1973, signed Fitz Warner, witnessed by Raymond E. Fowler. Fitz's identity was later on revealed and confirmed by Fowler as one Arthur Stancell Jr. Now, quite often his name is spelled S-T-A-N-C-I-L, which is incorrect in a confusion. It's S-T-A-N-S-E-L. But anyway, Stancell's background and credentials can be directly confirmed. Stancell began his career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at that time, Wright-Patterson Airfield, serving as a USAF aircraft engineer, test mechanical engineer for the Air Material Command after honorably taking part in the D-date landings of World War II. Arthur was additionally working at the Nevada Proving Grounds on May of 1953 when the crash occurred, specifically studying the effects of atomic blast on structures, as Fitz stated, and this was during Operation Upshot Knot Hole. To add even more credibility to Stancell, the engineer also worked on aspects of the Manhattan Project and for 16 years on the Apollo program. Huge thanks to Richard Geldrick Jr. for doing the digging on Stancell as you'll find in his linked medium article. So unlike some more controversial figures in ufology like Bob Lazar, we can in fact verify the background of Wright Pat, the AEC, and aircraft testing with Stancell. Let's start to break down and analyze the context of some of Stancell's claims. Remember first, his story came out in 1973 and 1978 was when Marcel revealed the truth of the Roswell cover-up. We can definitively rule out this accomplished engineer was just writing the coattail of the Roswell crash. Within Stancell's testimony, he mentions the night before viewing the wreckage receiving a phone call to report by one doctor, Ed Dahl, who was in fact a project director and physicist for Operation Upshot Knot Hole at the Nevada Test Site. Unfortunately, Dahl has long since passed and no statements were ever made by him about this alleged crash retrieval. However, there is another man with possibly even deeper connections to UFO crash retrieval. During his time working as an engineer at Wright Field from 1949 to 1960, Stancell worked in what was known as the Air Material Command Installation Division within the Office of Special Studies headed by Dr. Eric Wang. Dr. Wang was an Austrian-born graduate of the Vienna Technical Institute. In 49, Wang became the director of the Department of Special Studies at Wright Patterson where he worked with scientists from the Office of Naval Research and Dr. Vannevar Bush, who has some connections to the UFO phenomena and others from the Research and Development Board. Dr. Wang relocated his research from Wright Field to Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico around the time of Operation Upshot Knot Hole. Tracking down record of Wang has proven to be extremely challenging. However, direct proof can be found of his role in the Department of Special Studies in the actual DOD operation Upshot Knot Hole unclassified document. The importance of determining Wang's credentials cannot be understated, seen as Wang is a figure in UFO lore suspected of having deep ties to reverse engineering and crash retrievals around this time. More investigating needs to be done here, but Wang allegedly led reverse engineering efforts under Kissinger. Wang was known to be a close associate of Victor Schauerberger, an operation paperclip scientist who developed concepts for flying discs for the Nazis. Wang, of course, is not the focus of today's video. Neither is Dahl, but Stansel serving under both Wang and Dahl to an extent during the 1953 crash is of note. Three months after the alleged Arizona crash in 1953, the USAF issued Regulation 200-2, which required all UFO reporting to be sent to USAF Intelligence and not Project Blue Book, the official USG investigation group at the time. This directly stovepiped UFO reporting leading to fewer credible reports making their way to Congress and the American people, fueling the growing UFO stigma. I talked about this a lot in my Stigma video, go check that out. If you watched my history on the UFO stigma, you will know the Robertson Panel was conducted to quell public interest in UFOs, and was commenced in January of 1953, four months before the Kingman crash. While Regulation 200-2 most definitely relates to the Robertson Panel, it is quite plausible to suspect that restricting UFO reporting was to keep a tight lid on previous and future crash retrievals like the Kingman Arizona crash and possibly Roswell. Also, a key piece here is the AEC's connection to Upshot Knothole and the Kingman crash. As my community can probably recite by heart, the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement has been used to misclassify UFO material as quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear material to avoid declassification and restrict information to need to know basis. The 2024 NDAA Schumer legislation directly states the 54 Atomic Energy Act has been used by DOD and legacy programs to protect UFO program records and materials. And while we're at it, let's not forget the testimony of Lieutenant Robert Jacobs and Robert Salas of Maelstrom Air Force Base. If you have not seen my video on UFOs and nukes, I highly recommend watching to understand this anomalous connection of UFO to nuclear weapons. So the idea a UFO is active near the Nevada test range after 11 nuclear warheads were detonated in 1953 is far from surprising. Shockingly, Stansel was not the only credible whistleblower to make claims about the Kingman crash. Meet the under-the-radar alleged UFO reverse engineering whistleblower Bill Uhouse. Uhouse was featured on Stephen Greer's disclosure project in October of 2000 and made some astounding claims. Uhouse was a former mechanical engineer and 14-year USMC vet retired at the rank of captain with a history of flight testing of exotic experimental aircraft at Wright Pat. While working for a defense contractor and Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Uhouse claimed to work as a pilot and design engineer for a flying disk simulator. The simulator, according to Bill, became operational in 63 to 64 and was based off a recovered disk retrieval. And you can probably guess the crash he names. As I watch, the reason why I'm saying this is because the simulator wasn't actually functional until around 1958 where the simulator was actually operable. The simulator that they used or the craft that they used to build, which is a 30-meter one, was the one that the crashed in Arizona, Kingman, Arizona, back in 53 or 52, I think it was 53. According to Uhouse, the craft was taken to Area 51 slash the Groom Lake facility and the dead pilots were taken to Los Alamos, part of the AEC. Gotta mention, Uhouse also makes numerous other statements including touching on a recovered extraterrestrial humanoid codenamed J-Rot. However, this of course is not the subject of our video. Because Uhouse is making such high-profile claims and disclosing through Greer, he must be riddled with red flags, no? Guys, I have to do this myself too, but let's start removing whistleblowers from the stain of Greer and everything he touches. While Greer himself is egotistical, money-driven, and very problematic, he has platforms numerous incredible individuals to tell their tales, including Wagan, Uhouse, Herrera, Bushman, etc. One common thing you will learn from the men with incredible stories, they only disclosed through Greer because they knew no other route, and many, like Herrera, have regretted going through Greer. Anyways, Uhouse worked on a flight sim based off the 53 crash disc. These claims are far too crazy to be taken seriously when we cannot verify a man's credentials, who discloses through Greer similar to Don Phillips. Thanks again to the investigation done by Richard Gelderich Jr., Uhouse's storied history in the Marine Corps can be indeed verified. Remember, Uhouse claims 14 years in USMC services, 10 years in the Corps, and 4 years working with USAF in private industry on experimental testing. In this clipping from March 3, 1949, we can see proof of William G. Uhouse's re-enlistment with the Corps after previous USMC service, and again on the 30th of March, 1953. We can see in the evening times a newspaper article on Uhouse, this article confirms 8 years in USMC service, and tours in Korea for Uhouse, and importantly shows Bill's demonstrating capabilities of the Second Engineers Battalion. Bill's role in the Second Engineers Battalion was also confirmed in the service company report. And lastly with Uhouse, it's just kind of important to note in this How and Why article, it's stated Uhouse was invited by a man from Link Aviation, a simulator manufacturer company, to aid in the building of the F-102 simulator, B-47 simulator, and later on the flying disc simulator based off the Kingman crash. And quickly, I just want to cover some additional witnesses to this case who vary wildly in believability and credibility. In 1997, Leonard Stringfield, a respected UFO researcher, was approached by a pilot after a lecture at the Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. The pilot claimed to have been present at the crash site in 1953 and gave a recount of the biologics recovered that was very similar to Stansel, around four feet tall, large eyes, brown skin on face, and silvery metallic suits. And in 1994, another man codenamed JLD approached Stringfield, making similar claims about the crash but died shortly after. The glaring red flag of these unnamed and unaccredited sources came from one Judy Wolcott, who claimed to UFO researcher Don Schmidt, her husband, a Vietnam conflict officer, wrote to her saying he had been present at a UFO crash retrieval in Kingman, Arizona, where biologics had been recovered. Wolcott claimed her husband unfortunately was killed by NVA in the war. Wolcott was ousted by author Nick Redfern, who discovered that her events absolutely did not add up. Her husband had not died in Vietnam, and her own daughter stated Judy often lied and made up stories. Whether this was an attempt at a claim to fame or purposeful disinformation, we do not know. However, her case and testimony and the falsity of it is worth mentioning. What's going on guys? I hope everybody enjoyed this look into the Kingman, Arizona UFO crash. This case is of course severely overshadowed by its older brother at the 1947 Roswell crash, so little attention is paid to this case. I think it's incredibly interesting where things get hairy for me like most cases because I do tend to focus on nuts and bolts with my videos is the biologics. The 4 foot tall humanoid looking creatures with brown faces and silvery metallic suits, it gets strange. One theory I've heard to debunk this case, which is very strange for me, is USAF secretly testing aircraft and biologic effects when flying through nuclear clouds. So aircraft were remote controlled and chimpanzees were put in suits and crashed and killed. This of course doesn't explain the craft resistance to deformation at 1200 miles per hour, as Stancil said, but that's one of the funny debunks I've come to see. What do you guys think about the Kingman crash? If you're from Arizona and from the area and there's some more lore to this case that I am not hearing about, let me know. I'd love to hear from you guys some people boots on the ground from the actual area, so sorry for the long break guys, we'll be back to normal posting now.

Before we get into this interview, there's just a couple things I want to touch on. I co-hosted this interview with my good friend Joey is not my name. Many of you will remember him from my first video on Michael or have seen him around Reddit and Twitter as one of the first people to really start investigating Michael's claims of his experience in 2009 in Indonesia seriously. When we sat down to conduct this interview, we sought to really ask some of the lesser asked questions and lesser known details of Michael's encounter in 2009 and his claims of meeting a Black program insider. So we do kind of expect you to be somewhat familiar with Michael's story, at least know the base details of his 2009 experience and his follow-up claims. If you haven't, I highly recommend checking out my original video on Michael that I did with Joey or watch his Sean Ryan show podcast appearance. Both are fantastic videos, I highly recommend checking them out. If you're not too familiar with Michael's story, if you'll remember back to my Marines and UFOs video, you'll recall this is the first time I ever covered Michael's story and I was super dismissive of him, super skeptical. That's why after all these months of talking to Joey, talking to Michael, sharing meals with Michael, hosting Joey and conducting this interview, I'm super excited to revisit this case as it's one I've been privately investigating on my own for quite a while. So without further ado, please enjoy this interview with Joey is not my name and Michael Herrera. So you guys get to the top of the hill and of course this is when you observe this object. Who, which part of your team first observed this? It had to have been, it wasn't me, it was somebody else and they were more pointing like, what is that? And so this was a big misconception for me at first, Joey had to kind of help me visualize this as I'm sure it was for a lot of other people too. You guys only saw the top triangular section and some lights of this. Not really lights, lights didn't happen until the thing actually took off. But you can see, I mean, if you're going to try to think that these are two trees, right? And that's kind of like where you can see the top part of it, but then you see the other part, but you can't make out the whole size of it, right? Because you have trees and everything distorting it. So really only we saw was something changing colors often this little thing that I had visual on and you see it moving around. It's like, it's not a building. I mean, we thought it was a building at a point, but I mean, it's just off in the distance right there and it's changing colors and something that you have green vegetation sticks out like a sore thumb. It's easier to say if it was a building because I mean, you'd expect kind of buildings to be in that area, but this area didn't have any of those buildings, didn't have anything like that. So who made the decision to kind of go forward and check this out? It wasn't me. And it was the person in charge and that's who was the one that did that. As you approach the object, you could only still see just above the tree line, the top of the object. You could see the whole thing. Yeah, so when we got down that hill and it was something we weren't allowed to do obviously because you're not supposed to abandon your, whatever your post is. Yeah, I'm curious about that. Can you describe what was going on at the LZ at the time where you guys decided, I mean, to make this decision, this risky decision to go and check out whatever this was? So I don't remember much going on at the LZ. I just remember taking video of that helicopter that was off in the distance. It wasn't like it was super close. Did you guys feel like that helicopter was part of your responsibility to guard or was it like? I just assumed that there probably was other people there or probably other Marines on board that they were probably dropping off in that area. That would be my assumption. I don't remember thinking anything like that back then, you know, 14, 15 years ago. Yeah, I mean, I can imagine, you know, whatever you guys saw. Well, something that wasn't, it was abnormal and, you know, yeah, curiosity is a good thing to an extent. But I tell people all the time, curiosity is what kills a cat. And it's something in this way that it changed our lives. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't a light decision. It was a risky decision and you guys made the choice and, I mean, we didn't even rack around in the chamber. It's just like we weren't expecting to really get into anything like that. You know, it was just walking down, trying to see what that is. And then if it wasn't nothing, we're just going to go back up the hill and resume to what we were doing. And obviously it led to what we experienced. When you're walking, you know, you guys are at the top of the hill. The decision is made to go check this thing out. And at the top of the hill, you don't actually see any people. You didn't see those, the trucks yet. You're just seeing the top of the craft. So you guys go down the moment of interception with these guys. Can you describe? I think, I think what gets lost on a lot of people is how fast it happened and how quickly they took control of the situation. I mean, what was your first impression when you saw these guys? Well, I heard people yelling at us. That's what got my attention. And when we saw weapons in their hands pointed at us, you're not going to move, you're not going to raise your weapon up because obviously that's the point. And then obviously, and during the briefing, I had touched on in numerous interviews that there was a possible SEAL team that was out there trying to handle things that they were tasked on. What they were specifically doing, I don't know. But I remember in the ward room that that's what they were talking about, having some sort of element of US Navy SEALs there. And for a second, we thought it may have been them and we're just like, oh, shit, here's these guys. You know, they don't, then obviously we were going to talk or something or just go, but these guys were not, these guys were not carrying themselves as SEALs and they didn't have anything identifying on them. And obviously they were screaming at us, telling us to put our weapons, you know, put our hands up in the air because we had slings on our stuff, right? So that's when we're putting our hands up in the air and every single one of us did the same thing. It's not like, I mean, how are we going to raise a weapon that doesn't even have a full chamber? What are you going to do at that point? If you even rack that round and try to bring it up, they've already got their muzzles pointed at you. It's almost like a police officer coming up to your vehicle when they do a traffic stop and they feel threatened or they may have an indication that your vehicle matches the description of somebody who has had a gun pointed at them, for example, where they would believe that it's reasonable suspicion for them to deploy their firearm. Are you going to move suddenly and make him think you're going to reach for something and he just blasts you? No. And how did these men approach you in a tactical column, a pincer? We were the one that was in a tactical column. They had, so if I was looking at this and we kind of started, and that's when we naturally kind of spread out like walking towards them, and that's when they basically had four guys on this side and they have four guys on this side. And I talked to numerous special operators about this type of tactic and they called a nosebleed, which is where they have basically interlocking fields of fire with this direction on one target. It's a very rookie, easy thing to do and these guys, they already had that position. So it tells me that maybe there could have been more operators that were around that area, maybe on the other side of the craft, on the other side of where the trucks may have went off, which I didn't see them go off anywhere. But from what I've been told, there was more than just those guys there. So if we would have gotten into any kind of conflict, we were severely outnumbered already. At what point did the craft become fully visible? When we got to the bottom of the hill and we walked a little bit forward and it started to clear out. And that's when this thing was just sitting there. And then the men approached you right after you noticed it? Correct. As soon as we broke that threshold of getting into that clearing is where they basically had us intercepted. It's not like we could run behind anything because you can't. Right. And the trees weren't like big red oak trees where you could hide behind. I remember the trees probably being as big as this water bottle, at least how thick, probably a little bit thicker, but that's not enough to stop anything. It's not enough to hide behind and not get hit. So everybody has the whole, they think they're John Wick until they're in that situation, but it's like I would like to see anybody else in that situation to see what they would have done. Because knowing what type of operators we encountered now that I've already been through all of this, been briefed on it, been included to an extent, none of us would have been a match for those guys. And so what did these men do as they trained the rifles on you as they approached you? So they were pointed, they were screaming at us. You could actually hear them flip everything off safe because it's not a bull click. And where we were at, obviously, there's not a lot of noise coming from the hill obviously because everything that's going on over there is basically silent because you have a hill blocking everything. And then the craft's not emitting any kind of noise except for that little hum or that guitar amp. I mean, it's not exactly like a guitar amp or like a transformer, but something similar to that. You actually replicated pretty good to an extent. So and that wasn't as audible compared to when everything started to go on and when they had us, because we weren't at the, where we just broke that threshold, right? We actually pulled up a little bit more as they were telling us to. And so they had their weapons on every single one of us. And there was only six of us, there was eight of them, which means that it's easy for them just to, I mean, I don't even know if their weapons are full auto. And they probably could be. There's or not, there are only three round bursts or semi-automatic and most of the time they teach us to shoot in a semi-automatic, you know, one round per person, a kill shot at least. So, I mean, it's not a head shot. I mean, you have a T-Box and what you're trained for combat marksmanship, but these guys could have full automatic M4s. I wouldn't have rolled it out, you know, which means that they just need to, each person doing a couple round bursts, three to five round bursts, I mean, it's going to get everybody where we were at. Now, one thing that people bring up is, you know, you did have, you had your camera, at the top of the hill, you actually got some pictures of what you guys were seeing. I remember at least a couple of photographs, but I remember a video as well. That's right. I remember a video and that's when I had a dump pouch, which all of us did have a dump pouch, but I had it right here all the time and that's where we basically put expended magazines because you're not going to drop them because you have to reuse them. So it also helped, too, if you had carry extra ammo because if you had some malfunction or sometimes we use the saws with, because my had regular saw drum pouches on my stuff, where I could put a drum here and a drum here and then I had grenade pouches up here. And most of the time, I would just put magazines and whatever the easiest side to reach was and that's basically what I had. So we didn't have like M4 or M16 pouches. I had saw drum pouches where I had all the mags in, which we had a combat load, six mags. They disarmed you, right? Yes. That was kind of their first, like once they approached you, you described how they were very methodical and how they did that. They wanted to gain control of the situation, which they had that control, right, but they're going to sleep better because they took our weapons from us and slung them and going through making sure that we had our magazines out. It wasn't like they were spending us like some law enforcement officer checking you, tracking around your ankles, anything like that. They're not doing that. The only thing that they searched us with was our military IDs where they knew they were at, which is what my suspicion was that these guys were former military at some point because they knew exactly where our IDs were. And you said they interacted with your IDs with something that what we would recognize today as a modern day smartphone. Yes. So they had something that I referred to as a bat system that we were trained on, which is like a biometrics and tracking system. It could be the acronym for it, but I just remember saying bats. And they tried that first. So they put that away and they had these things. I mean, it wasn't like, because iPhones were kind of bulky back in the day and they had blackberries and I had a Sony Ericsson MP3 phone that was pretty bulky. And they had something that was really thin. And that's what they were using. So it could have been something that was comparable, but then again, I don't know. So while you're getting searched, the craft is in the background. For anybody that hasn't heard you describe this craft, can you tell us what it looks like? So I remember as, because there was corners, which means to me it was an octagonal shape. Actually, could you, would you mind drawing it for us? Let's see. I got pens over here. Let me, yeah, let's... I like that idea. That would be cool. And you know what? I'm going to move. All right. So what did this thing, what did this craft look like? Okay. So this is going from our point of view, right? That I can remember. So I'm just going to say this is like vegetation, right? And this is to represent that clearing. What I remember is kind of like a pyramid shape at the top like this, because I remember seeing some shading and some were kind of brighter than others. Like this. Then I remember it doing like this and then it had corners, right? This may be looking a little bit strange, but this is just a rough draft. It used to be a better artist back in the day. And I remember seeing these vents, at least that's what it looks like on each of the corners like this. So there's a vent here, and it was like it was positioned on the lines, like this. And then on each corner, when this thing took off, it had lights that would pop on, which would have been like red, yellow, green, and blue are the only ones I remember that kind of had a line that went like this. And it had some sort of scale pattern that I estimate is octagonal, but it could honestly be circular, it could be square. I wasn't close enough to depict it, but this is where this was the blackest, darkest thing that I have ever seen in my life. It's almost like light got absorbed into this, and I don't know if this is just because of the craft. It may help with a function, but there's probably third graders or something that say they can probably do a better job than this, and I'd probably agree with them. So now what about the platform? Platform underneath was kind of like it was raised like this, not off the ground, but just like an incline. And it went underneath like this, and it was around the same kind of length as a craft, and it had kind of some points on it as well, which obviously it fits under the craft when we saw that happen. And it wasn't like where we were at, I would say this is approximately even the same distance as it was. There was not like there was any light or materials on here that I remember seeing. But then you have, I'm going to draw stick figures. So I'm just going to draw them black, because these are black team guys. I know this is not a van Gogh or a Mona Lisa drawer, but I'm just trying to gather everybody's attention to see how, what I can recall as this and all these guys, and we were essentially in this area kind of online, four, five, six, right? We weren't like evenly spaced out, but you guys can kind of see how there's six of us, there's eight of them, they've got good field of view. We can see this going on the background, and I'm going to draw a line through this, but basically where the directions or the trucks came from were from our left. So they're coming up and then they would go like this. I don't remember seeing them go off the platform and going somewhere else. I just remember them going on here, but then we're also facing the fact that we're dealing with these guys at the same time. So our focus is going back and forth. One, you don't see anything that looks like that ever. Two, you're not in a situation where that happens either. So as I wish there was more details that I can remember aside from that, but that is what I briefly recall as far as what the craft looked like. Besides changing colors from a light matte gray to a dark matte black, the whole thing. And so before this craft took off, what did this platform do? So this craft kind of sunk down a little bit like this. This platform itself raised up. And there were trucks and other crates? I don't remember seeing the trucks. They could have been because where we were at, and mind you, I didn't see it as it started going up. I saw it when we were going back and forth, and the only thing that got my attention and I'm sure it got everybody else's attention, and I'm only speaking from my point of view was the only thing that got my attention was something was moving. And because your eyes are used to attract movement, right? It's just something that gets your attention. So when I saw that raising up, it was already, what I'd estimate, over R, if we're only 5, 10 to 6 feet tall, it was probably almost 10 feet off the ground. Did it raise rapidly or in kind of a slow motion? Not super rapid. It was enough to kind of be slow, but still enough to where you could catch it. I don't remember seeing any kind of containers going up with it or trucks or nothing. I just remember seeing the front profile, the truck, with a trailer behind it, and that was why I was able to see that cylinder in front of that container. Let's get another piece of paper and draw the trucks. And actually, I want to show you this too. That drawing is going to be worth a lot of money someday. Oh, yeah. Keep that. Let me do this. Oh, get the signature. Cool. This is probably my favorite part of the interview. You drawing this stuff? It's awesome. I feel like I'm in kindergarten right now. Showing off your colors. It shapes that you recognize. But it's cool because it helps you kind of describe, as you're doing it, you know. All right, so, all right, trucks. All right, so what are these trucks, the containers with them? Could you describe those? Yeah. Like I said, I only saw it from certain profiles. And what I remember distinctly with these, I don't remember seeing like a Ford logo or nothing like a Chevy Duramax on the hood or nothing like that. We obviously were kind of far away in comparison to that. So I'm going to draw three different views or profiles, which I remember seeing these trucks. So the first one's going to be as if it was coming towards us. So there's going to be like a headlight here. There's like a grill, right, a bumper. And I had like a, I remember having like kind of like a hitch is what I'm assuming. And then, there's another headlight here. Again, I'm going to apologize ahead of time that this isn't going to be, I remember seeing. Now, when you say you didn't see logos, like you didn't see Ford or Chevy, but you stated what kind of trucks they were, though, recognize the body style. Yeah. And I would say that their Ford F 350s is what I would assume they were. Did you just say that Uncigno was black dollar or gotcha? What I do recall seeing is I had like these things on the sides here, kind of like vents, but they're not really vents. And it's kind of remind me of what they had on military hummers for night vision. So that's kind of what they had on there, which tells me that they run these at night time as well. And these were like big, aggressive off-road tires, right? Truck bed, okay. You can kind of see these cases, which are Pelican cases on the back. And what are Pelican cases for anybody who doesn't know? I mean, it's a brand, but these are weapons, because we had the same ones that we transport weapons with. And that's just... Do they carry small arms, munitions? Yeah, stuff like that. So then this was hooked to a trailer that had four wheels like this, okay, trailer. And the only thing I remember seeing of this container, I had the ridges kind of like a shipping container, but not much. I had the cylinder that's kind of on the front right here. So I wanted to show you this. Let me just throw this right in front of that, so that camera gets it. What do you think of that? Looks identical, but then again... Now, the other thing... I remember seeing it having four or two tires on each side, right? So a dual axle, yep. So this was another thing I found where they actually have the Connex box on top of it. With more aggressive tires, but this looks shockingly familiar. Because that's like the type of... I mean, that's a shipping crate, you know? I think this is called a TriCon configuration, so they're all standardized, like the sizes and stuff. And these were outfitted. They had these cylinders on the front right here that would come to find out it's actually oxygen supply. Yeah. So draw those cylinders. Okay. So I'm going to black it out completely because the cylinder itself was black, and that's why... And initially, when you saw this, you hypothesized this might be humidity control for something like drugs. Or drugs, right? That's what I testified to Aaron with, because I didn't think it was people. That was in my thought process at the time. And we'll talk about Aero in a little bit, but so you testified to Aero before you did the NPC in June of 2023. Yes. Okay. Yep. That was... I had testified last year to Aero. It was late April. Okay. Late April, 2023. Okay. Late April, 2023. Yep. All right. So that's kind of the view that... That's really good. So and then obviously the side view... So cylinders basically spanning the whole width of the container. Yeah. Correct. It wasn't like a small one. It was just a whole width. Correct. All right. So here's where the tires would be from the side profile of that trailer. Of course, there was no white wheel as it was all black. I remember seeing kind of the back. Okay. And then this container right here. This is the cylinder from a side view. Okay. Truck bed right here. How many trucks total do you remember seeing? Four. Four. And did each one also have weapons crates or just... Yes. Each one of them had these... What you would call pelican cases. Okay. But just weapons cases is what they definitely look like. Were the cases opened, closed? Closed. Okay. And the windows are remember being kind of dark. So... Could you recall any other operators or people in the trucks besides just the drivers? I remember one truck that went on the platform and now the door, at least some of the doors open. I can't recall. Were there any people standing on the platforms? Yeah. I don't remember. But I don't remember seeing people on the platforms. So that is kind of... And these are black, of course, right? So that's a side view of what that is, right? Okay. Which, I mean, obviously these were black, the shipping container was black, everything like that. The other profile I'm going to draw is going to be from the rear. Did each truck have a shipping container attached to it? Yes. Okay. So here's a container right here. I don't remember seeing the bars. Hatch doors on the back. Yep. Like this. Okay. Can't really see the cylinder at this point, but I'll just indicate it being there. You also said that they were up armored? Yeah. I mean, it's so... What did you mean by that? So they looked a little beefier, thicker material, you know what I mean? Like they look like they'd be bullet resistant. Okay. You can see a regular truck and they're kind of like, okay, it's a regular truck, but these look like they were reinforced. Kind of like a secret service car? Yeah, to an extent, but... Okay. All right. So there's a container like that, which we're not elevated, but this is just to put perspective of the truck and just so how we were seeing it from the back. That's the only views that I remember seeing these trucks. Because you were in front of the craft and they kind of came out in a little bit of a circle. The left side like this and then went up that direction. Okay. It wasn't like they went straight. They were going up to that platform. Okay. So you see the craft. You're basically getting weapons checked, weapons stripped from this team. What happens then? So they're going through each of us, taking our stuff. They take our magazines out of our pouches and they kick them off. They got one guy off in a distance that I remember was a standoff distance, like more than 10 feet. So obviously we tried to run and grab our stuff and he's just going to light this up if he wanted to. They had a different rifle platform to the main guys. So same load out with all of them. They all had the same stuff. Yeah. They had the same kind of, I mean they may have different attachments, but I remember most of the parts seeing ACOGs on each one of them with the PEC-16 illuminators on those. Those is what I remember seeing. One thing I've always been curious about, did you notice any of them like talking on the radio to someone? One guy had a radio and I don't remember him talking to anybody. I just remember seeing it and with the antenna coming up that he had pressed to his vest. But he was the main guy that was kind of telling people what to do. And he was mainly the one besides another guy that was, you know, and shit, it was like he will fucking kill you. You know, it's easy to get lost out here, etc. Did it seem like, you know, when they intercepted you guys, obviously there were other guys in the trucks doing their thing, did you have the impression that like all of a sudden there were like, oh shit, we need to wrap this up and get out? Or were they kind of just not really even caring about what was going on? I don't think they were kind of caring was they may have not even saw what was going on. They could have. I mean, I don't know that speculation at this point. Yeah, clearly we're getting into speculation there. But yeah, I'm just, it's like I also think about the fact that this, you know, the earthquake, you know, the whole reason this operation was there was because there was an earthquake on it was the end of or the first of September or end of October. It was the end of September and then I think it was September 30th, if I'm not mistaken. Don't quote me on that. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's I think that's correct. So and then, you know, the Denver shows up on the ninth. So we're, you know, nine, 10 days after the initial earthquake and, you know, just, you know, obviously speculation here, but it's like, it kind of seems weird that why would this operation be occurring nine days after the earthquake? You know, of course, afterwards you've kind of been told like what that operation was all about and, you know, recruiting people in disaster or struck in areas. But who's to say that was like maybe they had been conducting those same operations all week long. They could have been. They could have been. And believe me, those are some questions I've asked some of these gentlemen that I'm working with and they, you know, they don't know because everything's compartmentalized. I'm hoping one day maybe one of them that I come across does know because I'm going to ask him a lot of questions because I mean, I mean, just like anybody listening or watching to this or anybody who wants this to come out and come forward, I'm a hundred percent with them. I want this to come full circle just like anybody else. I'm just as impatient. The only difference that separates me from anybody else is the experience, but also having knowledge of what's going on to an extent, at least with what I've been exposed to. I just have a little bit more information. So you get to the point, you know, they're threatening you, they give you your weapons back and tell you to go, you know, back, back up the hill, don't go back. When you get to the top of the hill, what do you see happening at the LZ? I just remember me because I remember once we broke the top and all of a sudden I remember seeing some of our guys just start running. So I'm following suit with them, right? Because if anything's going to happen to us, it's going to get the attention of everybody else. And I remember seeing some people, but it wasn't like it was like close up. I just remember when we ran back, we had our weapons strapped to our back that were very tight, uncomfortably tight, right? Because it's compressing your vest. And remember having a gash on my right part of my neck because we had like a yoke or like a collar on our vest. And I remember that when they put that through that it actually kind of the slings we had weren't the best quality and they're not soft. They're plastic and polymer, whatever it is or cloth, whatever material they make out of them and it's very hard. So it kind of cuts you up a little bit. And then I remember us getting back there and I remember seeing a couple people off in the distance as far as some villagers or whoever the civilians were. And there was some other military personnel. I don't remember them being Marines. I don't remember what, they may have been the Indonesian military could have been there, but they were still off kind of at a distance compared to where we were at. And there was this gunnery sergeant that was there and I've never seen this guy before. I don't know if he was attached to the ship. I don't know if he was brought by any other means. I have never seen this guy before. Now gunnery sergeant, you recognize it because you see his rank, right? Now gunnery sergeant, that rank is specific to the Marines, isn't it? Correct. Okay, so when you speculate that maybe he was assigned to the ship or attached to the ship I think you kind of say, what do you mean by that? So each ship, if they're, from my understanding, again, I don't know 100%, but from my understanding there are some ships that have like a combat loading group or somebody who's basically loading Marine stuff onto a ship. I don't know the specific, I can't remember what it's called. They also have some Marines that are red patches. They have a red patch on their cover and then they have red patches on some of their blouse. They have some on their shoulder pocket and some on their cargo pockets. And this guy didn't have those. I thought I can recall anyway. He may have, he may not have, I don't remember. But I remember this rank because obviously it was a little hard to see it because woodlands have black shapes and sometimes it distorts that and if you end up calling somebody by the wrong rank you get to pay for it with pushups or get screamed at, right? So which honestly, if I was in that position I would have screamed at people and tried to fuck with them too for getting my rank wrong. So it happens. But when you ran back to the LZ, you were running towards the helicopter? No. Okay. The helicopter was not there yet. Okay. So what's back? He had a radio that he was talking with and he was communicating with whatever the pilots or whoever it was. So what happened when we got there, he kind of like, first of all, for security, why do we have our weapons slung on our back? That's out of place. No Marines going to have that going on. And that's what I think he was mainly more upset with was because that we were supposed to be our weapons proper, no magazines in, you know, which obviously they put our stuff in, but they put it into where it'd be very inconvenient to try to load it up and then go deal with it. So I think that, thinking back to that, I think that that's mainly why he was upset was because, okay, well, you guys look fucked up is mainly what I would assume, right? I'm just speculating at that point. But I remember us stepping off to the side, off in a distance a little bit, and we're basically squaring ourselves up. We're taking our weapons off of each other, giving it to us, putting a magazine in and having to resume the normal carry. And so this gunnery sergeant is standing just in the clearing where the LZ where you guys were dropped off. Correct. Was he surrounded by a platoon of Marines or was it just this gunnery sergeant? Just him. And other people off in the distance. And other people off in the distance. So they may have linked up and then he probably told them to go away or whatever he was doing. I have no clue. And then because he was on the radio, that's when CH-53 came in and picked everybody up. Now on this CH-53, did you recognize the pilot? Was this the same helicopter that dropped you off? I don't recall any of that. I just remember seeing the CH-53 and that's when it landed and we just boarded up on that thing. I don't remember. I mean, obviously our point of view, I don't remember looking at a pilot I never had a chance to and it's the same thing with this. I don't know specifically who was flying or what. And so nobody said to the gunnery sergeant, what you guys just experienced? No. Okay. So you came to the LZ, you got off the helicopter, that helicopter left, you go to the top at a certain point, a second helicopter comes at a different location, drops off supplies. Was that the one that had a cargo net? Yes it did. Because I took pictures and video of that coming in. So that helicopter is dropping that net and that's when you crest the hill, kind of at some point there, you crest the hill to go investigate the craft. You come back, that helicopter is now gone. What I'm assuming is they dropped the cargo off and then they may have landed and let people out. But by the time you came back, there was no helicopter that was there. That helicopter was gone but then there was obviously the supplies that they had dropped off. Off of the distance. So do you remember seeing what was happening with any of that? Like were there people? I remember seeing people over there and they could have been supplies but they were off at a good distance. And so where the gunnery sergeant was, was he near some supplies too? If I can recall, there could have been some boxes or something he was messing with that was there. There may have been boxes, I don't really recall. I mean, what he have even, is there a chance that he didn't even know you guys were there and he was kind of like. Could have been the case. Like where are you guys coming from? What's going on? It could have been the case. I mean, like I said, I really don't know. It's speculation. But I just remember seeing a gunnery sergeant there who was like, you guys looked fucked up and he was yelling at us for that reason. And so from that period of time to when you left the LZ, you were basically just doing what? Just hanging around, waiting for the helicopter to show up? And we were just kind of walking around by ourselves, of course, trying to make it look like we're secure in the area. Okay. So you kind of resumed that role of security? Even though through our heads, we're going like, what the fuck just happened guys? Were you guys discussing this amongst yourselves or was everybody pretty stone cold? We were stone cold. Nobody wanted to talk about this. Was there any point that you guys discussed it with each other? When we got in town to Subic Bay, the only question I had asked one of them was, are you going to say anything about this or tell your wife and he goes, absolutely not. And that's literally it. And have you encouraged these fellow Marines you were with to come forward and tell their story to? No. Okay. They're not happy with me for obvious reasons. I don't blame them. This wasn't something that, you know, I try to get one of them to help me with this to an extent. And his response, which everybody has seen publicly, was kind of the indicator that something did happen, that something was wrong. And that's for people who don't know the text that was featured in the Daily Mail article. That basically says, leave me out of this. That was when I had members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asking me to have some and to message one of them that I was still in contact with, seeing if he could tell anything anonymously to them, which they already know who he is. I've already provided everybody the names to these guys among the Pentagon Arrow. They all have that. Do you know if they've been contacted by Senate Intelligence Committee or any of these? Not that I'm aware, because I'm pretty sure I would have gotten probably yelled at or fuck you or something. So you guys get picked up by the CH-53 Superstarion, returned to the USS Denver. How long, what would you say the time elapsed was from the second you were in the Chow Hall approached by the major to returning to the ship? Well, we didn't get approached by the major when there was in the Chow Hall. It was other Marines, other people. I don't remember specifically how that happened. So who called the volunteers? She wasn't gathering everybody up. These were higher up. It could have been staff sergeants or sergeants or something. It says, hey, you guys want to come with this? So whoever was at that point, you're going to meet in the ward room at this time. And I don't remember the specifics of the time. I don't remember who told us. I mean, that's just so long ago. Yeah, but it's just helpful to kind of understand the context. It wasn't anybody in my typical chain of command, which was, you know, because obviously they were kind of more the, hey, you guys are needed for this. And these were just mission volunteers, not hand selected, like strong operatives or anything like that? No, they just randomly put us in sticks. That's all I remember them kind of organizing. You're in this stick, you guys are in this stick. So it wasn't like it was something that was very well planned or based off your skill set or what chain of command or whatever this was. Yeah. So like, I think we can kind of go chronologically through like your experience in Indonesia. So like the first thing I'm wondering is like, what, what did the typical day look like for you on the Denver? On the ship? Yeah. Like when you were, when you were like en route to Indonesia, like I know you were assigned to the officer's chow, like what would kind of a typical day look like for you just like on the ship? So typically, if I can recall this accurately, I mean, because every day blends together in this. Yeah. Plus it was like 15 years ago at this point. So I mean, you typically go to have Reveley, everybody would get up, but obviously we'd get up early because we were either helping with breakfast and having to serve up that and at least, you know, which there's, it's not like we were just serving food because we didn't do that. We were just more, I think, trying to set stuff up, try to clean stuffs, you know. So the cooks actually took actual good care of their job because they're working for the officers, which is great. So they want to take pride in what they do. We got to eat really good because of it compared to what the other guys got to eat. So that was always good. So breakfast... It's kind of like a full-time job, like that assignment was, was kind of like, you would report for doing officer's chow and it was like an eight-hour shift type of thing? Yeah. Or was it okay? Sometimes they'd cut you like with a break so you could either go, which I went to the gym on ship or I went back and then slept for a bit or whatever it is. So there's always things that you can do because when they task you to work on to that, that's where you're spending your time. So how does it work with, you know, especially for me because like I don't have any, you know, military experience, you know, you have like a chain of command that you're a part of, you know, as a Marine. But I know there's, you know, when you're on the ship, you've described kind of like, it's like a separate chain of command or like... Correct. Because what, who you're reporting to are like the Marines that are in charge of that part of the Marines that are on the ship with logistics. All they basically did was say, hey, your number's been picked, you're going to go over here while you're on ship, which is great. Yeah. Because like I said, we got to have fun doing it. We got to eat better than everybody else, you know, so it was something that I enjoyed doing because I got to eat tuna all the time, I got peanut butter, I got all the good stuff. We got T-bone steaks. Everybody else got the little tiny cuts and we got full T-bones. Yeah. So you would work in child with people that weren't necessarily in your immediate team or platoon, just random people on the ship whose numbers were called for same duty. Correct. I mean, it wasn't really a number basis. They just selected whoever, whatever amount they needed, they've all been told us to, you know, this is what you're going to do. And typically during that, I do remember deploying, at least being forward-deployed to Japan a couple weeks to, I think, a month before the whole main element did because they got us ready and we went on ship before everybody else did too, because we're obviously working this detail. So they have to kind of read you up on things, show you how to do things, and then when the whole thing kicks off, get on ship and everybody's just, you know, so for weeks we were on ship with nobody else in our boarding, which was cool too. So they were trying to figure out where Marines were being assigned to, if that makes sense. Now, so when you got, you know, you spoke about getting briefed in the ward room, that was where you were assigned. So how did that exactly go down? Like were you like in the middle of, you know, working in the kitchen and then you just heard someone call out like, you know, hey, we need some volunteers, was it? I think it was that. I don't remember that part specifically. I just remember the key things. I remember who briefed us, which was a female major, and then they were putting up pictures of Obama when he was a kid, saying there was family members were there. So the things that really stuck out of place, I kind of, what I remember mostly. Now did you, you had actually brought this up earlier. Had you ever seen that woman before? No. Like was she dressed in navy, do you soft blue? She was in, she was in our Mar-Pat Woodlands. Okay. So USMC. Okay. So were there other people who were kind of brought to volunteer with you? Were they in the mess hall with you when the major comes in and is requesting volunteers? Yes, some of them, not all of them, but some of them. And so at this time, like your immediate squad, team leader, the other people you're with, they're doing other duties on the ship. They're doing whatever the unit's doing, typically. So that's how that works. Now we weren't in a combat situation. So that's why that it was a little bit different because it's more relaxed. Now if this was something that was combat oriented, then they really wouldn't pull us off to do anything like this because we'd be training and doing whatever we had to do with our unit. Right. Because I know there's a lot of questions about like team leaders and so forth. So when you're on an active mission with a team leader, you'd be with them like glue, but on ships, you're assigned to your actual duties and so forth. Correct. And it also kind of depends on what details you're doing, obviously. So I mean, it's not like that for everybody. There's people, yeah, you have an acting team leader who's just a guy who fills that billet. He could be somebody else that's not, in our instance, was not in our platoon or squad or anything like that. So what kind of typical check-in would you have to do with any superior while on the ship? So when we would report to that, they'd obviously kind of take roll call, make sure everybody was there and then that's pretty much it. It wasn't, I mean, because really it's not like rocket science, for example. So you know, but it was, you also reported to Navy personnel too because they're the ones that you're typically helping and assisting. They're part of the ship. Correct. So they have more kind of what you would call a higher billet at that point because it's their ship. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense because that's really helpful just from someone who's not military that provides a lot of context. Now so during the actual briefing that you were given about the mission that you were about to partake on, were there other people in the ward room during that briefing or was it, so like there could potentially be bystanders that kind of overheard the mission briefing essentially. So anybody who was in there were some key leaders, but there was also some other NCOs. There were a lot of people I didn't know. So I'm just thinking there could potentially be witnesses that would have seen you, seen the briefing. If they remember. Yeah. I mean, right. You know, I mean, like I said, I don't remember anybody else besides some of the guys, but I just remember the thing that stuck out was a female major because she was beautiful. Yeah. Somebody that's, you know, of course you're on ship. You're like, man, I see a lot of women around. So there was that. And then obviously the whole thing with Obama, you really don't see anything like that. It's not something you're really briefed on most of the time. So I wanted to show this to you. Does this look like what that word would look like? I was trying to find a picture of like the actual Denver. Yeah. That would. That is a different ship, but it's the same, you know, the same class. Yeah. And from what I can recall, because they had a wall where the projector was hitting and that's where they were given. But that's kind of similar, at least from this view. Yeah. I mean, but then again, it looks a lot like other ward rooms that were on other ships that I've been on. Well, just to get a general idea of the size, like for me thinking like half a tier, because a ward room is essentially a cafeteria. Yeah. It's just like a fancy. Smaller because obviously, yeah, correct. Yeah. So it's kind of a more small, intimate kind of setting. Correct. What else can you remember from this briefing? What was the mission operation directive? What was the mission time? I don't remember any of those fine details. Just because one, it's been a long time. But two, the only things I can recall is literally the female major briefing us and then pictures of Obama when he was a kid, his parents, just stuff that really stuck out. Yeah. And I actually found evidence of Obama. He spent a lot of time in Indonesia when he was a child and that's all public knowledge. So it's interesting that they had included that. But I mean, just overall, like in general, what was your understanding of like what you guys were about to go security security security. Yeah. But I think it was there was there was a delivery of supplies, you can go to it to a remote village. You know, there's plenty of evidence that that says that the right helicopter, the heavy lift helicopters, the super stallions on the Denver were specifically going to be tasked to go to remote villages because roads were being blocked off by by landslides and stuff. And so you're saying security for the elderly. Yeah. Yeah. The whole point in this isn't something that just even what that female major was saying, but it's just even the fact that everybody knows that this is the second largest terrorist capital in the world. And very, it's a very Muslim dominant area. You know what I mean? So there's people that typically aren't going to be very friendly of us. And that's kind of the first concerns they were having. Why they did things the way they did. I don't know. I didn't plan it. I wasn't in charge with that. So there's things that even I have questions or it's like, why would you do that? Yeah. And what was the protocol after the briefing where you immediately ordered to go to a armory locker, check out weapons and ammunition and report to the super stallions? So all they told us to do was basically get. So they got all her stuff and we went to the armory to draw what and they already had weapons picked for us because that was a sawgunner. So we don't, they didn't, we're not using a saw for this type of ordeal, you know, because it's not, you're not going into combat. So that's how I remember because I was a sawgunner. I never really was issued an M16. First time I, when I got there, I was actually issued a 203 with an M16A4 and that was with Gulf company. And they said that the reason why they wanted me to do that was because I was the boot and they're looking for the people with the grenade launcher because they know it's a team leader. So meaning that the enemy's going to target you. So which, I mean, it was, it was cool because I'm like, I get to carry a grenade launcher, but then I liked the saw because it's a belt-fed automatic weapon and I like that better. And so naturally being used to them 16, it's stuck because I like having a machine gun. Yeah. Full auto. Yeah. And I eat. So, you know, the whole idea of you providing security, you know, and initially a lot of people would say like, oh, that's baloney, like no one would have weapons on a humanitarian mission. Because really the overall operation was humanitarian relief, deliverance, supplies, and people like, oh, you would never have weapons. But I found Rear Admiral Richard Landolt, who's the Rear Admiral who debriefed you after your mission on the ship. He actually did a sort of like a press conference briefing and I'll just read a part of the quote here. So once the 53s came aboard on the morning of the 9th of October, we put them to work first getting survey teams out to the countryside to see where it would be the best locations to drop the cargo that we want to get there and also to get people in place because when these helicopters start showing up with cargo, the first concern is crowd control, you know, so you don't want people, you know, rushing the helicopters and another little interesting thing that kind of supports this that I found was photographs from the 9th and the 10th of the Indonesian military because there was also Indonesian military doing relief as well. And there's a picture of the helicopter in a whole bunch of locals just like all over the helicopter, just like mobbing it. Totally makes sense that there would be a mission like that to provide security and not to mention we've, you know, at this point, have found numerous photographs of people, of Marines doing exactly that. They had rifles and were, you know, providing security around the helicopters. Right. Well, I mean, security is needed. It's just common sense at that point, you know, as much as people would say in the military or at least in the Marine Corps, common sense is not common virtue, but you still got to protect and have a barrier between everybody else because second largest terrorist capital in the world. There's also desperate people who are desperate to do anything for help. And you have that combination of things that can get pretty tricky. Thankfully, we didn't have that, but thankfully, I would have rather have experienced that compared to what we did experience. Right. Yeah, so. Now, do you remember, do you remember which day you did your mission? I don't recall specifically the day. That's kind of what I'm having trouble with. I don't know if it was the ninth or the 10th. So the ship arrived. So there's a little bit of discrepancy on the exact date and I think it comes down to the time zone of like whatever press organization reported it. But like, for instance, right in this testimony from, from the rear admiral, you know, he says the ninth. So it seems like it was like early morning on the ninth or like late at night on the eighth. So was it like, do you remember it being the very first day that the ship arrived? Oh, so, I mean, we never really went topside. So I don't, you know, we're in the kitchen or in the wardrobe or anything like that working. So I don't remember specifically where the only thing I remember is them turning the phones off because they had these phone banks that you have on ship and they turn it off for about a couple of weeks. And because I was going to call my dad and be like, Hey, we're here, you know, but they didn't want that. So I don't remember specifically the day. I do remember that when we were on foot that it was had to have been somewhere in the early afternoon or probably late morning, that timeframe, I'm not entirely sure. I can't recall that. I wish I could because then I can kind of pinpoint where things may have, we can coordinate it somehow. What, at what point did you realize that you weren't going to have radios? I wasn't a radio guy. So that wasn't, that wasn't my thing. So like wasn't even on your radar to like think, Oh, Oh, do we have radios? Yeah. Cause I'm not used to that. I mean, they trained us on the radios, but it wasn't something that we ever really had. I mean, I wasn't a team leader, a squad leader at that point, you know, so I didn't have access to that. And that wasn't a concern. My concern was just what I was dealing with. So I don't remember radios, you know, and the fact is, is I don't remember seeing anybody have radios. And the thing is, is it's a humanitarian mission. It's not a combat operation. You know, so it's not like you're stepping out, expecting you get into firefights and things like that. Yeah. Just humanitarian. So when you guys were gearing up for the mission, you just thought whoever they designated kind of squad or team leader for this operation, they would have something like that, correct. And I think there's been a lot of confusion about these points. So this mission happened during one of your designated shifts in the chow hall with a team that was not your designated team leader. Okay. Correct. You know, the acting as a team leader, you know, so which happens, you know, in situations like this, at least this is my experience. I can't speak for everybody else, but just with what I personally dealt with, this is how it went for us. Now going back to the rifles, you know, like I said, at this point, I found so much evidence that there were definitely Marines there with rifles. However, there were a lot of photographs of guys basically just providing labor, you know, moving boxes, loading helicopters, things like that. And one thing that was interesting that I learned from multiple platoon members that I had reached out to and spoke to, they told me that there was like this rumor that some of the first Marines that flew in had rifles and they got like chewed out by like an Air Force Colonel and were told to like go back to the ship because it was like bad optics. I'm curious, did you ever hear that rumor? I don't remember ever seeing an Air Force Colonel. Yeah. I remember seeing Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, which everybody knows about that. So but as far as an Air Force Colonel, I don't, I don't understand how an Air Force Colonel would have jurisdiction over that kind of operation anyway. Yeah. He wouldn't be in a role to tell Marines that they have to go back to a ship. That's somebody else. Yeah. I found that, I found that odd as well, but I, you know, I didn't know, you know, not, not knowing anything about it. I didn't understand a Navy Fullbird Captain or a Marine Colonel for that matter. He would have the authority to say something like that because what you're talking about is the money and the resources to get X amount of people from ship to shore. So it's going to just, it's going to cost money. It's just going to not make sense at that point. So you got on the helicopter and you flew to Tobbing Airport, which it's not named that anymore, but you said that you never got off the helicopter at the airport. It was basically just, you know, we landed and that's what I remember too. And this is kind of what I was able to provide people because we'd never gone off. Right. And I can know that basically the direction of when we were flying off the ship that they could see the ocean and they can start to see the land. So it kind of tells you somewhat the direction of where you're heading. All I remember from the airport that we landed on was that there was blue roofs. Yeah. That's the only thing I can indicate out of that. What I'm getting at is it's, it's perfectly plausible. If you guys, you know, didn't get off the helicopters, it's perfectly plausible. You could have landed there and not caused any sort of stir by walking around with rifles because you didn't get out, get off the helicopter. Yeah, we weren't, we didn't. So because I remember that too, because we were sleeping on a helicopter because that's what you do. You know, you get used to in transport everywhere. We did in seven tons of AVs, helicopters, all that fun stuff. So you're just like, I'm just getting a ride and you can fall asleep anywhere at this point. So and it's boring, you know, it's not like it's anything. So it's just humanitarian. You know, we're hoping at that point that there would have been something, but not in the indication of what we experienced, but you know, something outside of that. So when we, because what I do remember vaguely is when we landed on the airstrip and I remember seeing other helicopters basically trailing behind us and land. And then we were sitting there. I don't remember the time or how long we were sitting there, but I remember then us taking off. It's 53. Okay. There may have been some 46 is two. I'm not entirely sure, but I only remember the Denver and I only remember being on a CH 53. I don't remember any kind of other helicopters that were on that deck. Yeah. I never really spent much time topside. The only reason I bring that up is it's, I'm wondering if those were the same helicopters that ended up following you guys to the LZ, you know, because I know you had said that there were other helicopters because they're, that could be plausible as far as I know. The Super Stallions were only the ones that came on the Denver. Like there weren't any additional Super. Yeah. I don't, I don't remember, you know, I don't remember any of that. Right. I mean, there's been plenty of ships that have been on where I remember seeing 46s, which are the dual, the egg beaters, if you will. I remember seeing plenty of those, you know, but as far as the Denver, I don't really recall that. And I could have not been. Yeah. I just don't know. Even if your mission happened after the point where those guys supposedly got yelled at for bringing rifles, like it's plausible that you could have had your mission even after that point and just slip by on notice because you didn't get off the helicopter, you know. So the flight to the LZ described the view that you have outside the back of the helicopter. So coming from the airport, I can remember just looking at the ocean and then we were getting, I remember seeing some very heavy vegetation and kind of like hills, wasn't like flat with trees or bushes or anything. It was like getting thicker and was, I remember seeing some hills, not from the helicopter, but because when you get off the bird, they have one area where you can't go because you have this big tail rotor and you don't want to run underneath the thing. So they always say either I think is go to the right or the left, I can't remember. But whatever the, whatever side that tail rotor is not on is where you're egressing the helicopter. And then basically you would form a 360 around the helicopter to provide that security and then it'd take off. And then you basically would get into formation and you'd patrol out from there. I don't really recall when I got off the helicopter what I really saw at that point. I do remember seeing some hills and remember seeing some big, thick vegetation. I don't remember if I saw any villagers or other personnel or people there. Backing up just a step, like when you guys were at the airport, were there any supplies loaded on the helicopter? So this was strictly a personnel transport and were there any other people on the helicopter that were being taken to the LZ or was it just us? It was just us. And then you have the crew chief and you have some other crew support and then the pilots obviously. I don't really, I only recall one crew chief who's just basically walking up and down watching everybody doing their job. I don't remember anybody else. I just remember just one guy and I don't remember seeing any kind of boxes or stuff that they would store in there. And obviously we didn't have anything on the bottom because how are you going to land at the airport when you have something underneath? Yeah. Like a cargo hook type of thing, which some of the helicopters were transporting stuff that way. You landed at the LZ, you describe it as a hasty LZ. Yeah. Now, I've come to learn that's like a technical term, that means something very specific. Are you using it in that way or what does that mean for someone who doesn't know? Hasty is kind of like off the hip. It's not something very thought out. It's just like, okay, where can we, okay, right there looks good. Right? And that's maybe what they were thinking as far as the pilots are concerned. I don't know, but maybe they had it designated, but it just seemed to me because we were kind of the first ones there that it'd be hasty in my opinion. But then when everything else is set up, some other Marines that probably come in were like, okay, this is secured. It's something set up. It may not be a hasty LZ at that point. But when we approached it, I just remember not really seeing anybody there. So it's kind of like, okay, we'll. So there was no, so there weren't, there wasn't anyone at the LZ when you landed? Yeah. I don't recall that. There could have been some bystanders off to the, off in the distance that maybe saw the attention or saw what was going on that decided to come up at a later point. But yeah, as far as arriving there, I don't remember seeing anybody. So you guys step off the CH-53, your primary objective is to provide security. What do you guys do right when you step off the helicopter? Well, we saw this opportunity to take the slope because we have visual around everything. It allows us to basically act within that protocol, right? As being in a tactical advantage of being in an elevated position is where you want to be. And that's what, you know, that wasn't the one that made the decision. The guy that was in charge of us was the one that made that decision. You know, it wasn't terribly too far in comparison, but at the same point, when you have visual of that and you're also watching some other stuff happen, I remember really seeing one helicopter that actually had the cargo net on the bottom that was flown in, dropped it off and then it banked off to the right. What I'm curious is like, what was your initial impression when you got off the helicopter, like in comparison to your briefing, like your expectations that were set by the briefing, and then the reality of you getting off this helicopter and you're there, first of all, you said the helicopter left, right? Like it dropped you guys off, it's gone. You guys have no radio, there's really no one around. You guys are the only people there. So like, can you remember, like, was there an adjustment to your expectations of like the reality of the situation versus what you were expecting? Honestly, I thought it was more like, hey, we're not doing shit with this. Yeah. It's like it's just going to be boring to standing around looking at people like, you know, and that's why I had a video camera when I was taking pictures and video because I remember getting the one helicopter that dropped off something on video and I remember getting it and needless to say, it wasn't at the point where we, you know, because we were conditioned three with our weapons. It wasn't like it was chambered around or nothing. We just had a magazine inserted, safety was on, the bolt was all the way forward, weapon was on safe and the ejection port cover was closed as it states in the condition rules, right? So I thought it was just, oh yeah, we're just going to be standing around. This is just going to be kind of boring, you know, even trying to help out with boxes or something probably would have been more helpful in comparison here because you're actually doing something. Yeah. Right. So, you know. That lines up perfect. Like every single person I've talked to who was on this operation, you know, doing different missions on the operation described the same situation where they felt it was like boring. It was like an excuse to get off the ship. You know, obviously you're doing a good deed and you, and you know, it's, it's a good experience from that perspective, but it's interesting to hear that because I think a lot of people have this misconception that this was like, you know, because you had mentioned that, oh, you know, you were notified there were terrorists in the, in the location that you guys were like super on alert. Like this was like, you were ready to engage an enemy and, and you know, that sort of thing. Nothing like that. Were you surprised when the helicopter took off? Yeah. Okay. And did you have any sort of estimated timeframe when it was to return or the mission duration? I have no clue about that. You guys are, I suppose the squad leader decided that you guys should go up to the top of the hill, right? And you know what, it makes sense because we were out in the open and you don't necessarily want to be out in the open if you've got no support at that end. So where we were at was kind of hidden and you kind of get in the vegetation a little bit more. So I can kind of understand why he would say, let's go ahead and push up this direction. Now you've mentioned a second helicopter flying in. You had your camera, you know, you, you took some pictures of that helicopter coming in. But did you, I almost remember you saying that it, it didn't fly to the same landing point that your helicopter did. It landed somewhere. Off in the distance. Yeah. A little bit further away. So that makes me wonder kind of how big was the LZ essentially? Like was it was kind of just like an open area? Was it just like a, no, no, it was, it was pretty open. I remember it kind of being open, but that's where I remember the hills and stuff because there was like an open area with thick, tall grass, right? And it was kind of, I would assume muddy because it's a tropical terrain, obviously. It wasn't like we were on a dirt road or something that was already, you know, cleared out to be used as transportation. So I think it was just more in a sense that there's a clear area over here. And obviously there was, they probably, the second helicopter probably saw other people that were probably close to that area and assumed that those are the people. For us, we were off in the distance. So whether or not he could see us at that point, I don't know. I assume he wouldn't be able to, but because where we were at, I mean, there's trees, you know. Yeah. So you didn't see any sort of like preparation to the LZ, like they didn't cut down trees ahead of time. You didn't see any red tape. Cause I've seen some photographs of other LZs that showed like red tape kind of closing off the area. Yeah. I don't remember any red tape or seeing that kind of stuff. So. Right. So what the time elapsed was from the second you left the chow hall to returning to the Denver. I had it been a couple hours. Okay. Had it been a couple hours. But not like a full day. No, it was not a full day. It had to have been a couple hours. It was nothing. Something that could have taken place within the span of a chow hall shift. Like the time you'd spend working. Probably more than that too. Okay. You know, because it had to be a couple hours, man, you know, it wasn't, wasn't like an all day thing. Okay. Thankfully. You know what I forgot to ask is the, what was the weather like at the LZ? Sunny. Yeah. Yep. Sunny. I remember, I remember because it was hot. I mean, it was hot. Regardless of, I guess, if there, even if there was cloud cover, it still would be hot because it's tropical. I don't remember really, I don't remember actually looking up at the sky to see if there were clouds or if it was sunny. I just remember it being hot, assuming it was sunny. And so when you get back to the Denver, how does it work? Like, you know, you have your rifle, you have to like go back to the armory or something. We dropped everything off there, given the magazines. Wasn't my magazines. It was somebody else's. What do you mean by that? Well, there's the armor that gave us those magazines that were full. Because you were saw. So you had your own weapon assigned. Yep. I had my own magazines, but actually remember if I actually had those on my vest too, or if I were to left them locked up or in a typically had those in my assault pack, which I didn't bring an assault pack with me, trying to think, remember, yeah, it was somebody else's magazines, for sure. So it wasn't mine. Because this was a loner M16, loner magazines from assigned to a different soldier. People compare you to like the like the Dodie and Benowitz story, and I'm like, that's completely different because Benowitz didn't have this like a undeniable experience where he saw an anti-radio. Correct. Yeah, radio communications and he speculated that it could be ET and Dodie just egged that on. Correct. Yeah. This is totally different. And this is coming from Dodie himself. I asked him kind of what that whole thing was. Yeah. He said, yeah, well, somebody said they heard something, Paul, and this is what I was told to do. Right. That's what he said. So I mean, like it makes, it just logically makes no sense. Like if you were making this up, if a disinfo agent were to come and like, be like, yeah, I know about your operation that you stumbled upon. Yeah. It's like, if you made it up, you would know that he's lying. Well, exactly. Because how could he tell you that he knows about operations and stuff if it was made up? Like it just doesn't make any sense. No. I mean, I wish it was made up because then I wouldn't have to have been going through losing my fucking hair and having the, you know, sleepless nights and literally just, I wouldn't be in the uncomfortable position I would be in. Yeah. And it's not fun being in this position. It really isn't. I mean, that's why I tell people, especially, I'm not encouraging my guys to come forward and let's say if this thing blows hope and then all of a sudden everything is able to be proven true, and let's just say these insiders at some point ever do, or some information comes out that's physical that literally no shit can prove everything, then maybe they would. I don't know. Yeah. But it put them in a different position. But right now, I mean, even for myself, they know that I'm uncomfortable and they kind of like, well, it's your fucking fault. I don't blame them. I mean, but if I didn't see what I saw and somebody else from a different perspective was telling this story, I don't know how I would react to that. Probably, I probably wouldn't believe it. I'd probably be, but that's the only thing is before any of this happened, I was not somebody who believed in this shit. I was somebody who was like, okay, well, this guy's out of his fucking mind or, you know, well, you got, so you're, let me guess, you're in Mississippi and you're fishing and you saw a fucking craft and you saw a fucking graze. Okay. What episode of X Files are you talking about? That's how I would think of it. But then having my experience is just like, if I experienced this, okay, maybe there might be some validity to what they're saying. I don't know. I wasn't there, but I know based off of being in my shoes, it's like, it's hard to say somebody else is not true or to try to point out the flaws or anything like that. I know what it's like to be in somebody's shoes like that. Granted, I didn't see ETs. I saw operators and I saw it was clearly man-made. It was, didn't do shit on a normal helicopter or plane did. I can tell you that. Right. I mean, it's like an unmistakable experience like it's not like something you saw at a distance. I was like, oh, that looks weird. Like this thing's right here. Yep. You see it. It's huge. We're close enough to hear it. Yeah. You know, right. That's kind of the point. And you saw it fly off. Yep. I mean, it's like, didn't have a rotor. It wasn't like a helicopter. It wasn't a plane. Yeah. And no rotor wash on the vegetation. Nothing. It was like it was isolated in itself. Like it didn't disturb any of the environment. It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. And I wanted to be a fighter pilot and I knew pretty much what kind of aircraft we had at our disposal as a Marine Corps and especially the Air Force only has a certain amount of planes they're using, helicopters, same thing. There's only so many. This obviously was an Indonesian military equipment. I don't remember anybody come and saying, hey, yeah, Indonesian military has something that's sophisticated or Chinese or Japanese or for that matter. Right. You know. Yeah. I find it interesting to, you know, you testified to Arrow and like I noticed in the historical report, you know, they emphasize like belief and like, you know, basically trying to say, you know, people might believe what they saw or anything, but we can't prove that they're lying. And I'm like, what you're describing is an unmistakable testimony. There's no, it's not like you could say like, oh, well, maybe he believes that's what he saw, but maybe it was something different. I know what I said. There's no way it was, you know, some normal thing. If anybody was to have seen this, they would remember this for the rest of their lives. It's so distinct because this never happens. Right. It's stumbling. I mean, in some ways people think, oh, it's stumbling on the goal. No, it's really not. But in some cases of saying that, yes, we have this technology because there's human involvement, obviously. It's not like there's an ETs and they're floating, flying in this damn thing. And there's just operators who just choose to be there. I mean, it's completely manmade. And with the human involvement just tells me, okay, well, manmade human involvement means it's some group has it. Now I know who it is to an extent. And speaking of Aero, I really wanted to kind of fast forward to when you talked to him in April of 2023. What was that like? Well, like an interrogation to an extent. And so you spoke directly to Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, right? He's the only one that I can confirm that yes, I talked to. I know the other gentleman, but what I signed stating that I was not allowed to divulge where we met at or who was also there. But Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the interview. And I think he was in everybody's interview. I'll have to ask other whistleblowers. I personally know if he was sitting in there with them, but he was there. What was his demeanor like when you were speaking to him? Not really interested. Everybody else was taking notes. He was more interested in the fact of, because he only asked three questions and the three questions were all the same. It was who were these operators? I already stated once, I don't know. I'm not going to know the second time. I'm not going to know the third time. I know a little bit now of what group they're a part of and what their backgrounds may be. But I don't know who they directly are. And if it was any of the people that I've been talking and working with, I would remember who they are based off their faces. And none of them are those guys. When you testified to him, did Dr. Kirkpatrick say he'd follow up? Did he say what was going to happen next? Oh, yeah. We'll follow up on it. Because I had asked them if they could get the satellite imagery of that day and they said they had access to that. It's been more than a year and they have yet to have anybody contact me from Arrow saying that, yes, we have the imagery. Where can you point out? Because compared to 14, 15 years ago, it's going to look different. Maybe they expanded the city. There's things that vegetation have grown. There's any numerous things that could have happened between at that point to now. And how did you feel when the historical report volume one came out that was a complete misprint lie of your testimony stating you saw an extraterrestrial vehicle? Correct. I didn't say extraterrestrial. And I didn't say there were US special forces. None of that came out of my mouth. And you got to think that that's a purposeful omission to say those things because that's blatantly false. Correct. I've stated in every single interview and even in the National Press Club and even with some gentlemen that I've still in touch with who was in the skiff with me, he for one knows I never said anything like that because he was sitting right here when I was talking to Kirk Patrick among others. So I was pretty upset at the fact, but you can't really be upset because you already kind of expected them to do something like this and that's just what they do. Was there, because I think some of the people who testified to Arrow, there was a written memorandum for record of their testimony. Do you know if there was any written record of what you told them? I don't remember that either. I remember them taking notes and handwriting everything trying to get the details. But I think it was something that the witness would sign. They would read over it like, okay, yeah, this is what my testimony, they would sign it for record to be like, this is my testimony that I provided to Arrow. I signed several documents. That could have been one of them. I don't recall that. I remember saying a nondisclosure saying that I would not talk about who specifically was there besides Dr. K already admitting that he was in our interviews. So that's easy. The other gentleman, I can't. And then the location, I can't talk about that. That's legal binding because it's not anything illegal. So I have to respect that. What other memorandums have you seen for the Arrow? Because I've only seen Eric Tabers, who of course is a second hand kind of commenter. Well, I think there was something that was FOIA release from the Black Vault that I had recognized was a direct, it was the same exact form that you had shown me. So I had recognized that. And that was provided for me to look over before making that trip. Prior to, yeah, it wasn't like the actual one you signed, but it was kind of a review. Yeah, because there were screenshots of this gentleman's cell phone that he sent me who's involved with that. Did you watch his interviews with Steven Greenstreet? It'll just piss you off. I don't watch any of his shit, dude, because I just know it's all bullfucking lies. There was supposed to be a second piece that completely got moved. You know what would get people's views if they, hey, Sean, go ahead and come on to this podcast. Here's the whistleblowers. Hey, buddy, how's it going? Haven't seen you in a while. Thanks for being a fucking dick. He would never. He said he would. Guess what? I can contradict the shit that he's talking about. So can other people. He said he wouldn't do any more media appearances after getting caught at a 2018 skinlocker ranch briefing. He's live. Well, Brandon actually had posted that. Because he did the same thing. I didn't talk to him about this. I wasn't at this meeting. And then Brandon just posted the picture on Twitter. I remember I hit Brandon up at that point. Yeah. What I actually kind of find funny is, so Nathan came forward. Your team leader claims that you're making this all up. First of all, it's like, so he was unvetted with Patrick. It was framed as if he was in a position. There's no situation where Nathan would have seen the UFO because from your testimony, he wasn't part of your squad that was there. So he wouldn't have seen the UFO, right? Not at all. Yeah. So for him to be like, yeah, we were on this mission, but we didn't see the UFO doesn't make sense. Because whatever mission he did, obviously he didn't see the UFO. No, and that wasn't on the same one with him. Exactly. Nor was this a secret night mission. No, it was not. It was a secret, and it did not involve aliens. Not at all. I never spoke seeing ETs, guys. That's kind of why this is boring in comparison to other people's stuff. But no, it was not a night mission. That would have sucked if it had been our night. We didn't have night vision with us. My Kevlar, and I didn't even have a Rhino mount to mount anything because I always kept that off because it just get in the way during the daytime. Quickly I had, on my Kevlar I usually had goggles that were clear lenses. Most of the time it was just easy to pop those off and put them on just because, you know, I didn't like having darks because they just really fucked with my vision and just, I hated it. And not only that, but these were ESS and they fogged up like you wouldn't believe. At least clears are easier to deal with that as opposed to the dark lenses. But yeah, Nathan wasn't with me. Yeah, and I mean, so like one thing that I find kind of funny, like when you think about it, you know, if, you know, he's saying you made this all up. And so if that's the case, it means not only did you decide to make up a story about UFOs, but you decided the actual mission I went on with Nathan, I'm going to pretend that didn't happen too, which makes no sense whatsoever. And I mean, really the only thing that makes Nathan's testimony have any weight whatsoever is simply the fact that you're denying that you were ever on a mission with him because you could have very easily have just said, yeah, I did two missions. I did one with him and I had this other one. Yeah, I didn't do two missions. So it's like, it's just like anyone with half a brain would like know that, you know, if you were making this all up, just say, yeah, I went on this real mission with Nathan. Well, yeah, it could easily have said something like that. If that was really the case, if I wanted to lie about you, but then obviously the insiders wouldn't exist. And you know, well, that's the biggest thing for me is like, why would this insider be approaching? And it's just not one guy. It's multiple. You know what I mean? So why would they spend any time to try to help me if I was lying to anybody? Why would they expose themselves and their parts of it in details that I personally know? They wouldn't take that chance. They're already, their butts already puckered up just like mine compared because obviously what they're having to deal with personally, they wouldn't subject themselves to going to somebody who's lying. It doesn't make any sense. But so Nathan, the thing that's most compelling about Nathan is, you know, he is who he says he is. Correct. You know, he was your team leader. At one point, yes. He was on that operation. He was on the ship. All of that stuff logically lines up. And he has this photograph of two people on a helicopter. He says one of them is you. You've denied that. You said it's not you. Correct. I know who it is. I'm not going to say who it is, but I know who it is. Yeah. So the thing, the thing that's interesting though is someone found a match in the camouflage between that photo and another photo of you. Is it the Daily Mail photo? Yeah. Yeah. Because there's only two photos that I know that have been released. One of them was when I sent to Josh Bosworth with Daily Mail because they're like, hey, do you have any pictures you want to? Yeah. I believe it's you helmet on holding the saw. Correct. So yes. And I mean, but here's the thing. It's a medium rag that I was wearing. A lot of them are the same patterns of that way. It's not like it's a fingerprint of one specific thing. I mean, it's odd that it's in the same location. Like I know like some of the patterns repeat and that you can find examples of this all over of finding like the pattern, you know, on a leg here and then on a different uniform. Like it'll be on like the other leg or whatever. Right. And but it's like some of the patterns don't even look identical. Just a minor pain. Yeah. You know, that's just where we're at. So you don't think there's any possibility that like it was it was a picture of you on a different day? No, that was not me. It just simply facial structure doesn't look the same as mine. Yeah. It's not even me. I mean, even everybody I've showed that knows me is like, that's not fucking you, dude. Yeah. People text me like this guy saying it's you. That's not you. Yeah. So I mean, if that's what he's got, that's what he's got. That's not me. Right. But his intention with this is I don't know, but they're just, I mean, you guys have a history. I mean, oh, he doesn't like me flat out and the feelings mutual. But the thing is I moved, I got with what I'm dealing with in my life and that's all I'm focused on. I'm not making money off of this stuff. This doesn't get me anywhere financially. What it does provide is understanding and stuff that I wish I never learned, but the truth had to be known and I'm thankful at least these insiders were able to show details and share me details as well of what they were personally dealing with because these guys are working in that organization. Yeah. So let's let's fast forward to that kind of modern day after your whole experience. You don't talk about this for many years. What motivated you to come forward in because you signed an NDA that basically died in your life and correct and all of all of us did sign that. So what motivated you to come forward? What was your objective? Well, I just think the truth should have been out. I don't think that this should be secret and I don't think people should be dying and being threatened about ETs or craft or anything. It just sounds ridiculous to me. So my motivation was, you know what, somebody else out there besides the guys I was with and myself have had to have similar experiences and maybe maybe there's a chance in hell that mine connects the dots for something. Maybe my story can help other people to an extent as crazy as it sounds and don't get me wrong. I agree that it's absolutely sounds fucking nuts, but they're not in my shoes and I wish some people were because it'd be like, you guys would just shut up. You guys would stay quiet. You guys were like, yeah, that's not cool to talk about. I don't enjoy talking about it, but that was kind of my, my intention was maybe that this could help paint a picture or contribute in some way, shape or form. Yeah. And I think, you know, there was, there were whistleblower protections that had recently been been passed and I think I remember you talking about that kind of being part of your motivation like that. Yeah. Now that I have a safety net to an extent making the NDA illegal, you know, so obviously I haven't had any ramifications of that because it's not like, I mean, I've had harassment, but you know, and the harassment service is more of like, okay, well, obviously I'm pissing the right people off, you know, so if I, again, I have documentation of all the harassment that I've talked to with multiple people who know what's going on. If I was making any of this up, there wouldn't be this harassment, there wouldn't be these insiders or wouldn't be this, I wouldn't have a leg to stand on with, with other facts. Now there are facts in my world that says somebody else observing outside of my circle, they may say, okay, in their world it may not be facts, but for me in my world it is. When I first connected with you after my initial Reddit post kind of just researching the military side of the operation and like realizing that, you know, everything you said to a letter was accurate regarding the kind of surrounding circumstances and I was like, okay, well what's next, you know, and so we, you know, I reached out, we connected. If I'm honest, I actually grew more skeptical as we started talking because you all of a sudden started talking about this insider and I'm like, this is weird, like what are the chances that you would have this experience and now all of a sudden someone telling you that they know what you saw and they want to meet with you. So you know, I didn't have anybody else that I was talking to with this, I don't, I don't have a lot of friends, I don't care to have a lot of friends, I got a lot of acquaintances, I got a lot of people who know who I am to an extent. My world is just business and that's what I, you know, I separate this from business because business is what my livelihood and my employees are, that's what I care about as well as the disclosure of wanting the truth to come out. So it's not like I had anybody else to say, hey, and then when I saw what you were doing and I saw the attention to detail and everything that you were piecing together, that kind of put something in my mind to say, you know what, maybe this guy can help me out to an extent, maybe there's things that he could probably pinpoint or, or connect the dots on and just your attention to detail was just something that's like, you know what, this guy's got to ship together. Maybe I'm able to provide information to you that, because you seem like you, you're well versed in this, I'm not. I know what I experienced and there's other things I'm now learning, especially with your guys' help, especially pointing out to me things that I can pass on to other people and say, yeah, Rene, is this having any legitimacy to it? So, yeah, I was surprised at the amount of trust that you kind of put into me, right? Because like if you had, if you had like told stuff to the wrong person, you could have been, but I had a good chance of reading you and kind of gauging you, which is why we had a phone call that we initially had. And the biggest, the, the most craziest, biggest moment for me was, you know, you were talking about this insider who wanted to meet with you. I was so skeptical. It sounded so crazy, but like I had nothing to lose. It wasn't like I was this podcaster who like had to report on the story. Like I could back away from the whole thing if I, if it fell apart and I felt sketchy about it. I was like, you know what, let's just see what happens. We had a phone call the day before I recorded that without your knowledge. Oh, I was freaked out because these guys could have done anything. I was going to their backyard. I wanted to scream at you and like say, dude, don't go. I know, but I had to, I had to learn the truth and that's what they were offering. They weren't offering money. They weren't offering anything like that. They were offering a chance to set me and set the record straight of what I witnessed. And I think after keeping this, you know, it's quiet for 14 plus years. I think I deserve the truth. I think everybody deserves the truth because for what's going on is absolute bullshit of why it's secret and why these guys feel in the right mind that they want to kidnap people or offer them a way out of their situation and use them as a biological equipment in these programs is just, it doesn't sit well with me. I understand why, but I think if there was some kind of government intervention with this that there may be good people that want to volunteer, maybe see what they can do and if they can, that's their thing. And I understand that these guys are also doing the same thing, but I think they're given false promises. I think they're being misled like they are because that's why they're partaking in this and they don't understand the magnitude of what they're doing. And from my current knowledge, I know that a lot of them don't know what they're getting involved with because they're heavily drugged and they can't recall what they're doing specifically with what they're making contact with. Yeah. I wanted to ask you about this. So it was during the NPC, you learned that these crates weren't trafficking drugs, but people. So I did a two day event prior to that. It was June 10th, 11th and 12th. Was it the 12th that the NPC was on? Yeah. And then a Daily Mail article came out the 10th or 11th and the NPC was out of the 12th. Because I had talked to Josh Boswell with Daily Mail prior to going to DC. And Greer was the one that set all that up. And my goal as much as I possibly can is having some transparency because I think that's important. And as uncomfortable it is for me to be public. I don't enjoy it, but if I'm able to provide in any kind of asset to disclosure in any kind of way, I'm not here for money. Everybody knows that. I sleep good because I'm not for that cause. I make my own money as you guys know, you guys have seen. So and it's even crazier that I got employees that don't know what I'm doing. And I don't talk about it freely. There's some people who do and they're kind of curious. Did they just like kind of find out on their own? Yeah. Some people talk. So I assume that some people don't know because nobody asks me. Some people have seen what I did and they're texting me, man, that's, you know, they kind of try to get in detail with it. I'm like, I can't tell you much, man. You know this, you know, just jumping back to, I just wanted to emphasize that the biggest moment for me and you actually at this point, you're kind of like totally read into all of the evidence that I have. So like that meeting you had with the insider was the pivotal moment for me because that conversation that you and I had prior to the day before that meeting gave me very specific starting point to be able to track the helicopter. I knew the location where you guys were meeting and it just, it set up a way for me to verify a lot of things. Correct. It was an important piece of evidence. And so that is what led me to... To verify on your own accord. To verify without you even knowing. Correct. Where you went. I was really surprised when you told me after the fact. I was like, how the fuck did you find that? And I was like, okay, now that it's obvious after that point. And I think it was a good slip up to an extent because it was able to at least pinpoint somebody to be able to verify. Because with that helicopter flight, you were as well as I was able to provide other events that were going on. Yeah, that was the other thing because like prior to me revealing to you that I like tracked it on radar, I was like, hey, do you remember what time you took off and you told me and it was exactly what the radar said? I was like, holy crap. And then, yeah, there were some kind of limited time kind of events that were happening on the ground that could be visible from the air and you corroborated that. I was able to cross check that with local news and like I've spoken to you about how I authenticated the evidence and used... And the only thing I could say without going into specifics is you know where I went. Yeah. That's all we're going to talk about at the moment. And I know you know now because he's provided and I've okayed that because I think some people should know. I trust you guys. You've been by my side for a year without finally meeting you today. It's still crazy. Yes. But I can tell because I read people very well. That's where sales comes into. I can kind of gauge. And I know that you're for the truth and I know you are too. And I am as well. We're all in the same shoes as far as wanting this to come forward and wanting this whole thing to stop because our way of life can improve. The Insider provided a lot of information for you to disseminate. Yes. And granted, it was tough for me because they were in attendance and it was a group of day, not pronouns. They were in the NPC 2023. They were there but they were also there at the other events. The one three days before. It was two days. So it was a 10th, 11th and 12th. So it was during, was that on a Monday, the NPC? Let me look real quick. So you were talking about just a couple of days before the NPC. That's when you first kind of met these insiders. So I didn't meet them directly but I know that they were in attendance. And when I had presented on that Saturday, I believe, is when it was. Saturday and Sunday. Yeah, I think it was the Saturday and Sunday because I got in Friday afternoon or morning and then they went to the hotel. I had dinner with Greer and everybody kind of met them. Actually, it was a couple of drinks at the hotel. And then we got our rooms, got everything situated. Going downstairs, I introduced my wife to everybody too that I've already been kind of somewhat familiar with and talking to. And it was my first time of meeting some people like Michael Stratton person, Dr. Greer in person. Well, no, that'd be the second time because he was here in Boulder. That's when I first actually met him and I was in 2017. And I was, I just kind of felt that he was somebody at the time who was talking about this and there were some things that he had hinted that were may have been maybe other people of experience would have experienced that he was talking to. So I wanted to tell him, Hey, this was my situation. You know, anybody else who went through this, maybe it's something I can convey and compare notes to this person. And of course, they don't, some of them are dead and some of them refuse to talk understandably. But yes, these insiders were there. So when I had did that event and it may be on YouTube, I can't find it anywhere. It may be on YouTube or some, because I know it was recorded because Dr. Greer and myself were kind of frustrated that their audio and video people were kind of slacking. I had given my piece that day and I had expressed that what I hypothesized was drugs, right? And that's when Dr. Greer pulled me aside and showed me his phone that had text message from this individual that had, he had this encrypted app. It was not signal with some other high tech communication platform did not look like signal. And I read the text message and what that text message said was, and my wife was actually sitting on the couch in the, in the green room and I was close to her and Dr. Greer was standing to my right. And the text message said, I don't want to leave Michael hanging, but I know what Michael saw and he went through this whole, he wrote a Bible essentially of what it was to an extent. But he had talked, he wanted to now talk to Dr. Greer privately and discuss what it was. And so I, at that point, because I was, I was volunteered security for him, which is what I'm doing with this too, but it's more of me to kind of see what the fuck else is going on. That's just how I can get information. So you do, you perform, you help benefit somebody, but you also get to kind of learn more in depth with what's kind of being going on and you get to be in the sensitive meetings and stuff and kind of really see, so it's kind of my personal way to kind of disseminate information and maybe be able to understand. That's just my curiosity, but I met that gentleman, which of course he didn't know that I knew who he was to an extent because Greer said he was going to meet with him and maybe they were going to put me in a green room and have a face-to-face conversation, which never happened. And then I wake up to a text message that he sent me at two o'clock in the morning. I don't remember what day, I still have it because I have it all saved, of course, just in case. I have a paper trail just in case anything happens. And he had said that a gentleman's name, to an extent, knows what I saw and would like to talk to me about it, and he is the knock, non-official covers what that stands for in the CIA term, and he gave me his phone number, which is one of many, at least that number. So I was like, oh shit, okay, and it wasn't like I wasn't expecting it because I was like, okay, this guy probably won't bother with me, he'll just tell Dr. Greer everything and then Dr. Greer will tell me what I dealt with and experienced, but that wasn't the case. So I sat on it for probably about a day or two because I was like, okay, here's a point and I'll return realistically, and then I was like, you know what, fuck it. So you're referring to he wanted to meet with you, what was the message that you sat on? So the message I sat on was Dr. Greer providing me his contact information. So that's what I sat on. And so I was just thinking every scenario in my head, like oh fuck, what am I going to, what is this doing, am I getting set up, was part of that too, I mean it's a percentage. Because I'm nervous, you know, I've already kind of said my piece, I'm nervous now the whole world knows what I disclosed and it was very uncomfortable, I hate fucking being public, but it's just, it's something that needs to be done. And he had, I called him and he did not answer and he did not have a voicemail set, so then I texted him and he responded immediately. And I have it, I have the text messages and basically what he said, he was going to fly me out somewhere and he was going to be able to provide me documentation among other things that will help me with this, but now that I came forward, these guys were working in that organization that I witnessed doing this operation. He had some insight to tell me and that's what we did, we met up and you had the phone call of that and you have some details about where I met this gentleman particularly and where he flew me off to, to provide me more information. Now why do you feel like he wanted to meet you in person versus just talking on the phone or video call, that sort of thing? Like what was that? I think it was establishing trust. It's easy to talk to people on the phone, getting face to face with people and having them tell you things. Now granted, when him and I met and we were sitting across from each other, and I've said this in multiple interviews, but I had my phone off because he had had this one that can detect any chips and I showed you the text message, or the message that he sent me talking about why they did that and which they're all chipped. So that's all I'm going to say about that. But I guess it was a chance to get the truth and I can tell when he was talking to me that he was very fidgety and very nervous because he doesn't know who I am and I don't know who he is. So him being nervous, but he looked through my background. He looked at every possible detail about me, so he knew everything. So I know that he knew that wasn't some asset planted in trying to fish people out, which I know is a concern of theirs, which is why they're screening people heavily and do what they do. So which I was just as nervous and that's when he, during that interview or meet up, that meeting, that's when he provided me a sidearm as a way to establish trust. And I looked at the bullets and there were no struck primers, nothing like that, popped it in, wrapped it, put it on a lap like this and nobody else was armed. At that point, I kind of started getting to know him a little bit personally, some personal details about who he is and what he does and other things. He's got a family, which is great because it tells me he's on the right side of things and he loves his family very much as you should. And that kind of gave me hope that, okay, this guy actually is taking that into consideration, which tells me everything. And his body language was also what conveyed it to me too because he's very fidgety with his watch. He's kind of like trying to adjust himself and it's like, okay, I know you're telling the truth because this is making you uncomfortable as much as it is making me. And there was also sort of an apology that he gave to you. Yes, he did. Can you talk about that a little bit? He apologized saying that he's sorry that we went through that, that it's absolutely unnecessary and it's bullshit and that shouldn't be happening to anybody. And he knows of instances where they, yes, they have murdered people, not him directly, but he will never kill a patriot. He will never kill innocent people, but that guy will murder and kill bad guys as it should be because he's like a sheepdog. And all of these guys that I'm working with are the same way. They're all good people. And some people have had confusion to say, oh, we're, we're, how the gunpoint with these guys and all of a sudden they're welcoming me in and, and giving me this, this knowledge and trust. No, it's not the same people. These are the good guys. Very few. So these guys weren't involved with the operation you witnessed in 2009. No, they were not. But they are aware of those types of. Yes. And they've been on similar operations as that to my understanding. And so he showed you some things. Yes. You've said you went underground. I can't talk about any of this. Okay. I don't, I don't, I'm not going to ask you what you saw. What I, what I want to ask you is why did he show you that in the sense of? What, what you could ask is what the things that he has been able to show you were proof. It was a way of him able to prove who he said, who he really was. That's exactly what I was. It wasn't like I can just take his word and just say, okay, I trust you. It was a way for them to say, these are the real deal guys. Because it's not like anybody can just see this shit. And I hope one day I can get to a point where I can talk about that. And because it is, it is mind blowing. And I thought what I witnessed on, in 14, 15 years ago was mind blowing. Yes, it is. But now you actually see things face to face of what, you know. Because, I'll put it this way, that facility, if these guys were to link up with two politicians and then give them a free access card to everything, it would single-handedly blow the doors off of this whole chicanery of misinformation and all the lies and all the deceit that are being there. This would prove everything. They're doing that right now, but they're trying to plan it out. And what way I don't know, but that's what their goal is. And I can't give any details about that being mic'd up and all this, but I can tell you otherwise. But they're upset. A lot of them are upset. I guess what I'm getting at is like, what's their objective with this? With reaching out to you and informing this partnership or relationship with you, what is their ultimate motive? Because these are people who are first-hand participants in the program. Yes, for 30-plus years. Yeah. And so their pro-disclosure to a certain extent? Pro-American, pro-freedom, pro-life. You know, obviously they don't like that people are being murdered over this kind of stuff. So there's kind of factions within... Yes, that's exactly what people call the program, and these are kind of considered the good guys who want to support some level of disclosure and restore an oversight by Congress. So the other reason is that these guys were somewhat tasked to try to go through us or infiltrate, right? I think what would have happened is these guys would have been whistleblowers or considered whistleblowers themselves. Not in a public fashion like I'm doing or anybody else that's in my shoes. But I think what happened was now that I came forward and what I experienced is directly related and directly involved with what they've been doing, it was more of a chance for them to say, okay, we can lay low, but now we have a spokesperson for us that can get this information out and help us get information out to the right people. And that was successful and they'll be able to do that. But I was also successful and able to get them in contact with certain other prominent people. Do these guys, these insiders have any fear of coming forward? I personally have talked to some whistleblowers who are allegedly afraid to speak because they will lose pension, they will basically, they and their family will not have a way to provide. Yes, they will lose everything if this is not done correctly and carefully. And again, I don't know if these guys are coming forward. I can't specifically say that, I don't know. I just, maybe one day they will. Who knows? What do you think needs to happen or if you can convey what these guys have said, what needs to happen or change in order for more first-hand participants like them to be able to come forward, what needs to happen? The tables need to flip as far as the, the majority of these people in these programs are good people. That's what I, from my own interactions with some of these people, granted I'm not working with everybody, right? But the ones that I know very well now, they're good people, they got their heart in the right place and they got the right mindset for this. What would need to happen is that the tables need to turn as far as them flipping the tables on their own programs, meaning taking control of them personally, getting the bad guys or neutralizing that, however, because what people need to understand is that this group is the enforcement arm of even the political corruption that's going on because they have assets in certain places in government, local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, military, everywhere. So if they were able to single-handedly take the bad guys out or flip the script or gain control of that, because right now there's a war between the good and bad of these factions. The bad guys want to keep this secret and they want to keep this technology to themselves and they want to commit crimes against humanity with this technology and have this power and control while the good guys want this to come forward and everybody benefit from it and us as a species be able to survive. Also the fact that they know directly what is going on because they're living in this world. Day-to-day job, so to speak. So I think now that they have an opportunity to understand that this is affecting other people besides me, besides, I mean, it's affecting all of us because we could be, we could really be far in life with this technology and not only that, we could stop shooting down NHI because who's to say, I've never met any of them, I don't know any ETs or NHI, I can't, never came face to face with them. What I can tell you is that I know that the universe is massive and there's multi-dimensional universes or however this works with the theories that people have proposed and if that really is the case, the possibility that we can come across a species that ain't going to be too friendly with us is a possibility. So you're telling, and this is what the concept is, so this group is going to target them, shoot them down in the deserts, all over the world, in secluded areas and they are going to come across at a point maybe someday that they're going to shoot down the wrong type and maybe that type becomes a type that decides that, hey, you know what, we don't need these people around, we don't need this species around and they decide that we as people who don't even partake in that nonsense have to pay for it, meaning that our lives end as they can instantly do it if they wanted to with what I have been told and what I've understand how powerful they are if they're able to travel inter-dimensionally and through time and space and be able to show up here and go to any other place that they want to go and be able to control craft through consciousness and be able to pretty much, the way that they even said that, and this is just speculation of course because I've never seen this personally, but the way that they are actually able to be go through things, be inter-dimensional so it can be in 3D or just have the image of, but they can also pass through solid objects like it's almost them, their molecules or atoms splitting between all of those to separate them somehow, so that's just speculation, but that's what I've been told. And so if you have something that advanced and some very smart that can end our lives, this whole planet if they wanted to, and for some reason they choose not to, but yet we keep shooting them down, and that means us as a human species. So you described kind of the next step forward is for the good guys to kind of flip the tables on the bad guys, but what about the whole side of like legislation? Is that still an important factor? Well that allows certain things to happen to where there's involvement from both sides because there's laws that have to be abided by, there has to be military involvement to an extent, and there also has to be a law enforcement effort because essentially there's a lot of laws being broken with all of these, and that's kind of the thing that maybe they can get them on a technicality to get some laws passed that now all of a sudden these guys can't hide within that because now there's proof that there's stuff going on that the law enforcement like U.S. Marshals for example, because they have jurisdiction everywhere, it could be the ones to execute whatever they need to, that's just technically speaking. And what about like how can we get more people like the insiders you're working with to come forward? Are there, you know, there seems to be kind of like, yeah, we have whistleblower protection, but it's really not enough. It's really not enough, and that's exactly their concern. Yeah, so what do they think needs to be done from that aspect? These politicians need to get their shit together, and they can't be corrupt like we're seeing with the whole pushback of the M&amp;N domain and all that kind of stuff because these aerospace companies are paying some of these guys. So of course, hey, we'll throw you an X amount of money if you play ball for us and make it to where it's hard for them to accomplish what they want because then all of a sudden the game's up. These aerospace companies know what's going on. They're going to pretend that they don't, but they have access to this shit. And it may not even be the executives of these companies who know what's going on, but the contractors and the people that are within these groups know exactly what's going on and have access to it. And it's a very, it's relatively a small number. It's not like every single Boeing personnel or a Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or Northrop Grumman for that matter would have, every single person knows what's going on. They don't. Only certain groups in that do. And to touch quickly on what you were talking about about shooting down these craft, are you aware of in the program with these insiders if there's kind of an ethical tug of war going on that? 100%. Okay. And that's kind of why they feel the need to want to divulge information to me to spread it to you guys and to the world for that matter. The other aspect of it too is over these installations that civilian aircraft are being targeted as well when they're flying into these temporary flight restricted areas or TFRs. And it's in people, they will go for a flight, want to go see some scenic views of some of these areas that are beautiful nearby, but happen to stumble into the area just like we did at the wrong point of time. And now they get hit with these experimental weapons. Well, you can't even call them experimental because they're using them. They're not known. They're relatively, yeah. Are you aware of what these offensive UAP weapons are, how they work? I can't give specifics to it. It's a lot of them. I've only been, I only know of a few, but as far as the other ones that are more cutting edge, because like again, they keep refining their systems because they want to make sure that they can just take them out with a single hit and have an easier time doing it, I would suppose. That's just speculation, but they're always refining their stuff. They're always refining their reverse engineer technologies as well, which is why they test these weapons systems on them. So they had to explain that they put them, they put craft on balloons, have them go up to high altitude and then they hit them with these weapons because there's nobody aboard, right? And then they also have them stationary on the ground and they can hit them at different angles to make sure that it's, but what they have explained to me was that their EMP proof, what they have, they are, they are not vulnerable to any kind of modern ammunition like rifle bullets or 50 cal machine gun ammo or ammunition or rounds. Missiles can't penetrate through their weapons. You're talking about UAP? That they have, yes. Okay. They meaning? Yes. That they've designed and made. Oh, okay. So like the ARV reverse engineer, okay. Yes. Most of the ones that are coming out, and this is what some of the insiders had said. They are having a very hard time distinguishing the real craft from NHI compared to the ones that they've got. That's how far they've came with this technology. They can't identify one from the other. It's getting to that point. So it's practically been a year, almost within a week since you came forward. Correct. What's next for you? Has your motivation for coming forward now changed? Has your objective now changed now that you've met with the insider and kind of gotten involved with that side? Yes it has because I feel like I can now help these guys in any way that I possibly can. I've been doing that behind the scenes and it's good. It feels good to do that. It feels good to be on the right set of history with this and when everything does come to a head, hopefully there can be some positive movements that blow this all wide open and we can all benefit. We could all be better people at the end of the day. That's what I want. That's my mission. The other aspect is obviously being provided the information that people are being taken and used in these programs. That doesn't sit well with me. When I heard that, I couldn't sleep for a week. There's many times where I've hidden in the bathroom and literally busted down fucking crime because it's like, I couldn't do anything to stop that at that time, which sucks to know that. You're completely helpless. So I feel like it's my mission to get the right oversight to an extent and maybe there can be things that can happen on a global scale that get these programs to be known programs and maybe the right ways can be done with these where people don't have to be sedated. People don't have to be treated as if they're biological equipment or pink assets, as they call them, that they can actually have people gain a foothold and do this peacefully and make us all better people and everybody can live happily. Everybody can live evolved. We can stop paying utilities because free energy will be a thing. Maybe I got fast cars, but maybe I can get some faster shit that I can drive around or fly around in for that matter. However, that comes about. But I think what the optimism is that our world can be significantly better, but we have to go through some very hard times for this to happen. I don't have children, but I know you do and I know that your children do benefit from having a better world that they can grow up and experience and not have to go through the corruption and see what we're dealing with as people right now who understand what's going on. And I know these insiders families also deserve the same. Like I said, I don't want any money from this. All I want is for this to come forward. All I want is this world to get better and change. That's my mission. Anybody who has any problems with me not accepting money? Tough shit. I make my own money. I'm not bought and paid for like most of these people who try to keep this shit hidden or secret or threaten them. They can threaten me all they want, but all it's doing is pissing us off and get us pissed off enough. And we actually do something that actually, because here's the problem. As much as I would like to say or believe me, everybody, because what I'm saying can be verified to an extent, which I choose not to because I'm keeping people safe in the process, as you guys know, but be skeptical. Because there are people coming forward who should not be or they're muddying the waters to an extent and they're very known people. I don't get in drama of this shit. I don't care to. I've got my direction of where I'm going and that's what I'm focused on. I let other people gossip and talk while I'm just focused. So that's what they can do. People need to understand that yes, as much as I want people to believe what I'm saying, but at the end of the day, disclosure is about evidence. It's not about testimony. It's not about what I say. If I had proof. So you think evidence is coming at some point? Very much so. How it will happen, I have no idea. But I hope it does and I hope it comes full force because then it's going to kind of catch a lot of people with their pants down. People who pretend in the government that they don't know what's going on, but they fully will do because they're getting paid from it under the table. So it's going to be interesting how, oh yeah, you didn't know that this existed, but here's some documentation or some people are saying that you were being paid for it. But yet they got this material or whatever it is that they have that's actually out. And now people know for a fact, oh shit, NHIRT exists guys. And we've had access to this and we've been in communication to an extent for a very long time. And I just got to ask two quick closing questions if you don't mind. I think it was on the Total Disclosure podcast. You talked about that you had been in contact with David Grush. Can you comment on that? I've talked to him and that's all I can say. Okay. And two, this is just kind of a personal one because I've seen this bounced around a lot. I have seen many people call you Joey and Joey your publicist. You two are not the same person. And Joey, are you Michael's publicist? Not at all. Are you anything other than a private citizen who's investigating Michael's case? Just a random guy. Are you paid for by Michael? No. Oh man. Yeah. I know. I can imagine that's the skepticism going on. It's just like Reddit. Most people are just anonymous on Reddit. And I just remained anonymous and now I'm showing my face now for the first time and just trying to crack that open a little bit. Yeah. Well, I mean, there'll be a right time where everything can be divorced and everybody can sleep better, you know? But I just saw what you were doing on Reddit and it's like, you know what? You're a very good person to get information out. I don't know anybody else. And thanks to you, thanks to you, you've been able to link me up with people who have. That's true too. Yeah. You're very good at networking too. And that's part of the reason why I'm successful is because networking is key. And that's, I use the same approach with disclosure. So if I'm in touch with people who are pivotal with this movement, then I'm able to contribute in ways that I possibly can to bring this forward to an extent or however far we can get. And you introduced me to him, you know, which is great because you guys are wonderful guys, very good people, you know? So it's good talking to you guys and just even shooting a shit when we're not talking about this kind of stuff, you know? I can't believe we're sitting here and this is just. I know. It's been a long time coming. It's been a long time. I'm like, you know, if I had time to go out there, I'd definitely go out there and see where, you know, what your part of the world is like and see what you do day to day and you get to experience. You certainly keep busy with everything that you've got to do. Yeah. I'm surprised I'm not completely bald yet. It's getting there, but I got some hymns I'm trying. So hopefully that helps. But, you know, if not, then I'm just going to be another whistleblower that's bald. Yeah, dude. Rock it. Well, this was awesome. I'm, you know, so grateful that you sat down with us and just, yeah, excited to kind of see how things unfold moving forward. Well, from what I kind of understand, it may be pivotal to a point where we get to grip on the right way and it comes forward and everybody understands. It doesn't have to be secret anymore.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/4EMO38JUfVE/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Aaron</li> <li>Arrow</li> <li>Brandon</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>Granted</li> <li>Greer</li> <li>Joey</li> <li>John Wick</li> <li>Josh Boswell</li> <li>Josh Bosworth</li> <li>K</li> <li>Kirk Patrick</li> <li>Kirkpatrick</li> <li>M4s</li> <li>Mar-Pat Woodlands</li> <li>Michael</li> <li>Michael Herrera</li> <li>Michael Herrera</li> <li>Michael Stratton</li> <li>Mona Lisa</li> <li>Nathan</li> <li>Obama</li> <li>Patrick</li> <li>Paul</li> <li>Rene</li> <li>Reveley</li> <li>Richard Landolt</li> <li>Sean Kirkpatrick</li> <li>Sean Ryan</li> <li>Steven Greenstreet</li> <li>Sunny</li> <li>Twitter</li> <li>Uncigno</li> <li>a van Gogh</li> <li>Places:</li> <li>Boulder</li> <li>Brandon</li> <li>Chow Hall</li> <li>DC</li> <li>Denver</li> <li>Gulf</li> <li>Hasty</li> <li>Indonesia</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>Mississippi</li> <li>Nathan</li> <li>Reddit</li> <li>Subic Bay</li> <li>Super</li> <li>Tobbing Airport</li> <li>US</li> <li>Vet</li> <li>the Black Vault</li> <li>the Chow Hall</li> <li>Organizations:</li> <li>ARV</li> <li>Air Force</li> <li>Air Force</li> <li>Air Force Lieutenant Colonel</li> <li>Benowitz</li> <li>Black</li> <li>Boeing</li> <li>CIA</li> <li>Chevy</li> <li>Congress</li> <li>Connex</li> <li>Daily Mail</li> <li>Dodie</li> <li>Eric Tabers</li> <li>FOIA</li> <li>Ford</li> <li>Greer</li> <li>Lockheed</li> <li>M&amp;N</li> <li>Marine</li> <li>Marine Corps</li> <li>NDA</li> <li>NHI</li> <li>NHIRT</li> <li>NPC</li> <li>Nathan</li> <li>Navy</li> <li>Northrop Grumman</li> <li>Pentagon</li> <li>Raytheon</li> <li>Rear Admiral</li> <li>Senate Intelligence Committee</li> <li>Sony</li> <li>The Super Stallions</li> <li>U.S. Marshals</li> <li>UAP</li> <li>US Navy</li> <li>USMC</li> <li>YouTube</li> <li>iPhones</li> <li>the Air Force</li> <li>the CH-53 Superstarion</li> <li>the Marine Corps</li> <li>the National Press Club</li> <li>the Rear Admiral</li> <li>the Senate Intelligence Committee</li> </ul> <p>Download transcripts: SRT \u00b7 VTT \u00b7 JSON \u00b7 TSV</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/6DyTfIV87Ck/","title":"Michael Herrera: UFO Whistleblower (ft.

Since investigating Michael's claims, Joey has formed a relationship with Michael and has gained access to many details of Michael's encounter and following experiences never before discussed. Today Joey and I will be breaking down the entirety of Michael's allegations as well as Joey's insights and experiences both investigating and speaking to Michael. </p> <p>Follow Joey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JoeyIsntMyName Follow Joey on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/joeyisnotmyname/</p> <p>So who is Michael Herrera and what does he claim? First appearing publically in the summer of 2023 and then being confirmed as a first-hand whistleblower in the AARO Historical Report Volume 1, Michael Herrera claims to have experienced a massive, 300-foot-long, octagonal UFO in the jungles of Indonesia while serving in the USMC. This operation was not NHI, but run by a rogue military force who seemingly operated a revere-engineered craft and performed human transportation in the earthquake-ravaged environment. </p> <p>Following his 2023 public appearance on Steven Greer's Press Club panel, Michael claims to be approached by an \"insider\" who works in reverse engineering on NHI tech. This insider is allegedly pro-disclosure and wishes to trust Michael to leak small pieces of the USG black program's operations.</p> <p>Both the claims of witnessing the craft and meeting the insider seem wild and fantastical at first glance, but is there any truth or threads to pull on to validate the story of Michael Herrera and the underground UAP black group?

You look down into the valley, and there's a clearing with a UAP just sitting there. Sitting there rotating clockwise, and that's in transition this color spectrum, I was telling you too. So as far as from a distance, yes, that looks very accurate to what I saw. Rogue military force, if you will. The most concerning thing about this is they all had American dialects. They had American gear. They had OTVs, black, they had black camouflage. They had very similar setups to what we had, but more high speed, something what you would see special operation groups these days have. They had no insignias on. And that's what I thought it was it. I thought they were going to smoke us, you know, and they kept saying that, you know, we can kill you right now, you know, as this is. At the start of the year, I made a video titled The Marines Who Got Too Close to UFOs, where I talked about two whistleblower testimonies of men who encountered UAP throughout their military service in the USMC. And this included Jonathan Wagan, and of course, Michael Herrera. And guys, I'll admit my biases. While I was really supportive of Jonathan Wagan and found his story to be credible, I was really dismissive of Herrera. Now for Michael Herrera, I'm torn on his story. I just I'm not sure about that. This all changed when Redditor and now my good friend, Joey is not my name, reached out to me and asked if I was the creator of this video. Joey told me that he had been investigating Michael deeply and that he and him had actually established a relationship and talked weekly. I even left a paper trail with certain people, including Joey is not my name. And there's been a person who has helped with that, Joey, that's not my name. If you're watching this, thank you for your help as more of a person who has broad attention to detail in a lot of things, which is remarkable. His Reddit handle is Joey is not my name. And finally, he told me that he had enough evidence to attest to the fact that Michael met a man, an insider in the black reverse engineering program. This brief exchange messages led to a fast friendship between Joey and myself. And for months, actually, he and I have been talking every day on messaging, video calls and phone calls discussing Michael's case. And throughout this time, he has shown me some of the astonishing evidence to both support Michael's claims of his experience in Indonesia and his experience meeting an insider in the black reverse engineering programs. So today, guys, I am thrilled to tell you that I actually have my good friend, Joey is not my name on the show, to talk about his experience investigating Herrera's case and discuss some of the evidence he's actually found to corroborate Michael. If you've never heard of Michael Herrera, I'd be shocked, especially after so much renewed interest in his encounter, after being all but named in the abomination that is the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1. But for those of you who don't know, or may need a quick refresher, let's briefly summarize Michael's UFO whistleblower encounter. And guys, please note, as I talk about Michael's testimony, I will be recounting it as fact, as told by Michael. The reality is, there is still no way we can prove with evidence that Michael encountered this UFO in the jungles of Indonesia. But we can prove with fact some of the context around Michael's story, such as the military mission in Indonesia and the relief effort by the USAF and Marines. In the summer of 2023, Stephen Greer's National Press Club event featured an array of whistleblower individuals, ranging from credible to somewhat dubious. One of these men was a USMC vet who seemed emboldened to break his 14-year silence, yet nervous to reveal himself to the public. It was here Michael Herrera first told his story to the world. In 2009, 2nd Battalion 5th Marine Michael Herrera, at this time a 20-year-old saw gunner, was called into Indonesia for a human relief aid mission after the devastating Sumatra earthquake in Tsunami. Michael was stationed on the USS Denver, which is oddly enough the name of both of our hometowns. This was the only ship routed to the west coast of Indonesia from the US 7th Fleet. In October of 2009, Herrera's unit was informed they would be providing security to aid in the delivery of food and medical supplies, and it's crucial to note, although humanitarian missions generally do not see soldiers equipped with weapons, the 1st Marines reportedly were, and in this case, M16A4s due to the heavy presence of terrorist training in the area. Herrera's team arrived near Pandang from CH-53 Helos at a hasty LZ, where the team pushed to a high ground for reconnaissance purposes, and it's worth noting and rightfully one of the biggest points of contention surrounding Michael's testimony, Herrera states his team was not equipped with radio comms, and Michael himself states this was highly abnormal. The team trekked up a ridge at an elevation of roughly 300 meters. Herrera had on him a Panasonic camera and was taking images of the surrounding area. Once the Marines reached the high point of the ridge, something quote, stuck out like a sore thumb, end quote, against the jungle terrain. There was a craft rotating just above the tree line, transitioning colors between a light matte gray and a dark matte black. Perplexed, the team decided to approach and investigate, and it's key to note, Michael did in fact take pictures of the craft with the camera he stored in his spent magazine pouch. Reaching down the slope, the USMC team was about 150 meters from the craft. It was from here Michael estimated the craft to be 300 feet in diameter. It was octagonal in shape, rotating clockwise with Vantablack exterior panels and a pyramid type shape on top. The craft let off an audible hum, almost like a guitar amp. The craft floated 15-20 feet above the ground, surrounded by a quote, rogue military force. What was astounding is these men featured American dialects, American gear, and similar setups the Marines had but with much better equipment. These men had no rank, no insignia. Eight of the men engaged the Marines, directing their weapons at the soldiers and flipping off the weapon safeties, screaming at the Marines, asking what they were doing there, and threatening their lives. Terrified the Marines complied, they were padded down and stripped of their weapons. The rogue operators even knew to take the Marines military IDs out of their left breast pocket, where they snapped pictures of Herrera and his fellow Marines identifications. During this time, Michael occasionally shifted his glance back to the large UFO, where four F-350s sat with weapon cases and containers with an oxygen or humidity control unit which held what Michael would later come to learn were human beings. The F-350s loaded the supplies onto a platform below the craft. When the platform itself rose from the ground, connected with the craft, and the two connected pieces shot off westward instantaneously, no rotor wash, no exhaust, no sonic boom, none of the surrounding vegetation was disturbed in any way. When Marines were told to turn around, Michael thought that this was it, they were dead. Until the operators began reloading the soldiers' equipment and magazines back onto their persons. Escorting the Marines back up to the slopes, the operators told Michael and his fellow soldiers they were not allowed to look back or talk about what they had seen. Breaking the hillside, the Marines ran back to the LZ, where a resident gunnery sergeant grew furious at the non-combat-effective Marines. Flying back to the USS Denver, an admiral debriefed the team, and a few days later while on leave, the battery and SD card to Michael's camera were taken, along with the fellow Marine cell phones. And finally, when the USS Denver tracked back to Okinawa, a man in use-half blues with no name tag, pulled Michael into his office, where he told him to never tell anybody of his encounter, regardless of chain of command, discussing the event would lead to imprisonment or death. Michael was then forced to sign an NDA to never speak about the experience. And what really triggered me into being motivated to look into the case myself was hearing all of the negative reaction towards him for reasons that I felt were really flimsy. People were criticizing him because he said they didn't have radios, or because he mislabeled the name of a rifle or something. And I just thought that was pretty absurd to completely dismiss a whistleblower when you're literally sitting here considering a story about a 300-foot UFO, but because they didn't have a radio, that's too unbelievable for you, so let's just dismiss the whole thing. If the UFO community did not have the open-mindedness and patience and space to provide a whistleblower to give time to investigate and vet the story, and if we were just going to shoot them down immediately for really lame reasons, how are we going to expect the general public to take this seriously if we can't even give it a chance? The other thing was it dawned on me, this is a military operation and humanitarian operation, so there's a ton of photojournalism, journalists, military reports and assessments that were done all around this operation. So I saw that as a great opportunity to begin digging into the details to see if I could find any conflicts with Michael's testimony. And I ended up finding the opposite, that I was corroborating everything that I could find corroborated what he was saying. Now obviously that doesn't prove he saw a UFO, but it does corroborate all of the details around that operation that he was on. And so I made a post on Reddit kind of detailing those things that I found. Joey's first Reddit post titled Verifying the Events Around Michael Herrera's UFO Encounter Part 1, saw to confirm all the little bits and pieces of the military operation in 2009. Logically, if Michael could be found to be lying about any detail regarding the humanitarian mission, his whole testimony could be thrown out the window as, another UFO want to be. Joey provided documentable evidence to support all of the context Michael provided including, the USS Denver was the sole ship assigned to support Indonesian military efforts, regardless of Michael finding this strange. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit was present at this operation. CH-53 Super Stallion choppers were used to deliver aid. And finally, the confirmation of hasty LZs, threw a blog post which detailed efforts done by the US forces to deliver supplies to critical and remote areas. Of course, none of this actually proves that Michael saw a UFO lost in service, but this post does confirm key smaller elements of his story, including accurately depicting the military op in Indonesia. Joey includes a call to action asking Michael to reach out for further investigation. So my plan was to do a part two where I would, I wanted to figure out where the landing zone was. I thought if I could reach out to Michael and we could work together to figure out where the landing zone was, I have the 3D modeling background. So what I wanted to do was import that terrain into, you know, some 3D modeling software and be able to perform like additional analysis to cross check his estimates of distances and heights and scales of things. And I also thought it was important to illustrate the distances that are involved in this encounter because the landing zone was almost 700 or 800 meters away from where the craft was sighted with a hill in between in the middle of jungle. And so that was really my only thought for reaching out to Michael. I had no idea it was going to, you know, kind of spiral, spiral much deeper into what it has. I mean, how, how rare is it that we get any sort of testimony that isn't, that's literally just it, you know, most times it's literally just testimony. It's just someone's verbal account of what happened. There's no evidence. There's no nothing. So here we have a military operation that has, you know, aerial surveys being conducted. I'm sure there's plenty of satellite imagery, you know, that exists and just all of the different records that kind of track the movements of things. You know, it just that reason alone seems like a very exciting case to dig into where you have a lot of opportunity to uncover data. Literally that same day that I emailed him. He called me that night. We spoke for about a half hour and, you know, I got the sense that he respected the amount of effort I put into that post and just the, you know, just putting in the work. I have a feeling it was part of why he started to trust me and respect me moving forward. You know, he started trusting me with, with certain sensitive information that, that did help, you know, back up some of his, some of his claims, circumstantially, I'll say. Then he started telling me more about this insider. The discussion around this program insider who met with and disclosed leaks to Michael is where some followers of this case, including myself, justifiably raised red flags and heightened their skepticism. But who is this insider and for what reason did he meet with Michael? What can Joey tell us about this meeting and how can he prove Michael was flown out to a secure facility to meet with this shadowy figure? And also do not worry when we get to the actual contents of the meeting, we will of course discuss all of the leaks that were told to Michael by this insider. Michael's first encounter with this insider was actually mentioned on his first public appearance on Stephen Greer's national press club panel, which come to find out through recent revelations from yesterday from somebody who came forward to Dr. Greer. I don't know who they are, but what they had told him and what he has told me is that this gentleman knows exactly what these were used for because they had like a cylinder on the front, which is either for oxygen or what I have hypothesized was for vacuum sealing, which believed me to suspect that they were smuggling narcotics or drugs. Come to find out it's more disturbing than that. This gentleman has first hand account with this and says that it was for people. This insider wanted to meet Michael in person. And so he asked Dr. Greer to make the connection. And so, you know, he introduced the two or passed along phone numbers or whatever. And so Michael's telling me all this, you know, that this this insider wants to meet him and all this stuff. And I found it very suspicious, you know, I found it very strange that not only would he have this really incredible story about seeing a UFO in Indonesia, a huge 300 foot UFO, which is is pretty unique. I don't know. I personally don't know of too many stories like that that big. And now you're telling me that that literally an insider wants to meet you like, come on, this is, you know, this is pretty outrageous, you know, how did how did Michael react when he was approached by the insider? Was he excited? Was he skeptical? Was he possibly worried for his safety? Yeah, he was, he was very, he, he, I mean, the last time, if you think about it, like the last time he's interacted with any of these people, they had guns pointed at him and, you know, we're threatening to kill him and stuff. And so now here's someone, you know, allegedly associated with that. And, but he just felt like if he wants to move this forward, he's got to, he's got to take the chance and do it. And for me, you know, at the time, this was pretty early on in my interactions with Michael. And I didn't feel like I had the sort of relationship with him where I could, you know, ask questions or provide advice or anything like that. You know, I was basically just kind of respectfully, you know, taking information from him that he felt comfortable sharing with me. But I wanted to scream at him and say, dude, like, are you crazy? And mind you, I went back and forth constantly through this period where I would allow myself to pretend it's all real and like, you know, let myself just kind of sit there for a minute and be like, all right, let's say this is all real, holy crap, this is, he's crazy. Like he can't go and meet this guy, he's going to kill him, you know. And then there were times where I would be feeling the opposite and being like, okay, this is, this is clearly like a setup and he's telling me stuff that he's telling me is sensitive. But in reality, it's, he wants me to leak it, but he's telling me not to. It's like reverse psychology or something. You know, I need to be really cautious here. And so that was, that was what was going through my mind at the time and it was very much back and forth. But I also felt like I was in a pretty good position because this wasn't anything I had to take action on. I had reached out to him to kind of like try to figure out what the LZ was and then it kind of just snowballed into this other thing. But I felt like I was in a great position because there was really no risk or harm in me just letting things play out and see what happens, you know, Joey was rightfully extremely confused and skeptical as to why Michael confided so much information to him about the insider in the meeting time, date and location. It was then Joey actually realized Michael was using him as a dead man switch. Michael feared what might happen to him being taken out to an unfamiliar location by unfamiliar people. And in case he was in fact killed, Joey should release any and all information he had. That was what made me the most suspicious because it was like he was trusting me with information without any real justification. And then I realized, you know, that he was going out to meet this guy and I got the feeling that he was, you know, telling me this information in case something happened to him. And I called him out on it and told and, you know, he basically said like, yeah, I, you know, if something happens to me while I'm out there, you know, I want you to release all this information. I'm very happy that Joey brought this next point up as he has never actually talked about this publicly. The day before the meeting, Joey and Michael had a conversation about the meeting and Joey recorded this conversation without Michael's knowledge. I called Michael and had a conversation with him about the meeting and I recorded it without his knowledge. And I did that because I felt like I needed proof in case I did need to, in case something did happen to him and, and I couldn't get in touch with him and I needed to reach out to someone to prove that, yes, I'm in touch with Michael and these are the things he's told me and now I can't get ahold of him. I didn't think anyone would believe me unless I had some sort of proof that I was talking to him. So I recorded that. I think I actually shared that with you. Hey, Michael. Hey, what's up? I had a little time before I have to kick off this meeting here at 9.30. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, I just, you know, first of all, wanted to check in with you to see how you're, how you're doing, how you're feeling. Good. I had a meeting with these guys so I'm kind of, you know, I'm nervous about a little apprehensive, but if this is going to get carried any further than I need to, you know, I need to speak to the horse's mouth. So speak. So I've, I just, you know, it is what it is at this point, but it's fucking crazy. Yeah. I'm, yeah. I just kind of checking in. I mean, like, geez. So everything's basically all set for the meeting. Yeah. Tomorrow for tomorrow. So, so I arrived there around a clock. Yeah. They're time. And then there's, they're picking me up with picking me up. They got a, they're putting me in and then I'm going to some, apparently there's a facility out and that they're taking me to and then like somewhere to go see some things. So I don't know what that entails, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then you're going to touch base with me after, afterwards at some point. Yeah. Okay. All right, Michael. Well, be safe. My friend and look forward to touching base with you when you get back. Roger that, man. Thank you for being involved with this too. And, you know, I'm glad that you're checking up on me. Cool. You know, it's great. So yeah, as soon as I get more information, if I'm able to release some things after this meeting, then I'll let you know. Okay. Sounds good. All right, buddy. Bye. What stood out to me most about this conversation was the fear in Michael's voice. He sounded scared like he didn't know what was going to happen to him. And yes, he did provide specific details and also Joey did tell Michael about this recording later on. So please don't hold that against him. Michael knows, but using this information provided by Michael, Joey was able to verify many of the details that Michael claimed, think tracking flight records and such. There's other evidence that I can't share publicly. I think I did, I did share that, like some censored, a censored version of that evidence with you and guys, I have seen a lot of people dismiss or get on Joey's case for not sharing this evidence. He has in fact shown me a censored version of this evidence. And if Joey is telling the truth, which I believe he is, and showing me an undocked version of this evidence, I can say with a high degree of certainty that this meeting did in fact take place. This isn't to say anything about what the insider showed or told Michael. I can't comment on that legitimacy nor can Joey, we don't know. The evidence, of course, is not mine to share or to an extent, even Joey's. There is a larger behind the scenes investigation here being conducted that if shared publicly could compromise the investigation, or at the very least, make it somewhat hairy. I personally hope that the finer details of this investigation and Joey's evidence will come to light soon. I essentially was able to prove that Michael was taken to a secure facility, is how I refer to it, with this insider. And so for me, and the thing is, is like, I didn't have to rely on any trust of Michael. Like I didn't have to rely, like none of this is contingent upon me having to trust any word that any person has told me. This is objective data and evidence that I used to verify this. When he got back, and we started talking, I didn't immediately reveal to him that I was able to track where he went. And so I used that opportunity to further vet and criticize, not criticize, but validate his account. So I was asking him specific questions about timing. So at this location, Michael was both shown and told things by this insider. What was he shown? He hasn't told me what he saw there. He said he he signed an NDA. So what was Michael told? Strangely enough, this insider was okay with Michael telling Joey and the greater public about what he was told at this meeting. Now, Joey and I are both a little apprehensive to discuss these points, as we cannot back these up with any evidence, however, it's important to discuss anyways. I feel a little uncomfortable like going through kind of the speculative stuff that this insider has told Michael, because it's nothing I've been able to verify. Well, according to this insider, he is an advocate for disclosure and has been in the program for decades. Remember guys, all of this is speculation. This could very well be purposeful disinformation by this insider or utter nonsense, but I want to talk about these statements due to the existence of the insider and the reality of the meeting. Fortunately, Joey has made a post on Reddit detailing this information, which will be on screen now and in the show notes. This is all content Michael has relayed publicly or given Joey permission to share. Within the USG, there are two groups studying UAP, the blue group and the black group. The blue group consists of programs with proper congressional oversight, Think, Arrow, A-Tip, Blue Book, etc. Black group is an organization founded in the 1940s to reverse engineer NHI tech. The lack of oversight, accountability and endless reach of this black group mirrors almost identically what is spoken about in the Wilson Davis memo. This black group has successfully reverse engineered NHI craft to an unknown degree of success, but utilizes these craft for operations. The flying crafts are considered, quote, boring tech. There are other technologies that are far more exciting and, in the insider's words, utilitarian for humanity. EMP-like weaponry has been developed that can target and disrupt and disable UAP. Crash retrieval programs are able to lure UAP to locations where they are disabled via the EMP weapons and craft and bodies are recovered. Now we get into some of the real woo and troubling stuff. The program recruits people with quote, psionic abilities and quote, referred to as P3, often from third world nations. These individuals are needed to interface with and control NHI tech. Recruits from these third world countries are often bargained with to join the program in exchange for security and safety of their families, likely due to the permanent or semi-permanent isolation of the recruits while in the program. This is the operation Michael stumbled upon in Indonesia. Many recruits actually die in the process of interacting with NHI tech and this is due to heavy drugging to induce a calm meditative state. These recruits are treated like biological equipment. In order to fly some interesting choice of words there, NHI craft, a consciousness connection must be made. A black program pilot cannot fly an NHI craft directly if he does not have the desired psionic abilities mentioned. So the program has devised a method to connect a recruit to a brain interface machine where the pilot controls the machine to control the person's intentions, thus controlling the craft. If true and this is a big if, the implications of this program existing are beyond disturbing. But let's try and keep investigating. What else can Joey tell us about this insider? I do know that this insider is real and I can say that because boy, I don't know how I can publicly acknowledge how I know that. I will say that there are other people who have corroborated the existence of this insider to me personally. I know that he took Michael to this location and so due to what I know this location to be officially, it leads me to believe that this person has quite a bit of authority to be able to bring him to this location in the nature in which he did. My first question is how the heck does anyone get to bring a random person, Michael Herrera? Especially a civilian at the time. For sure. Yeah. That's impossible, right? There's got to be all the security and cross-checking and surveillance of every person who's walking in and out of the place and the way this all went down was just like, holy crap. He literally did that. So what are the implications of that? So I know Michael was taken to this location and I know the insider exists, but I don't know if anything the insider is saying is true. So the insider has provided Michael with a lot of leaks, information about the Black Program. He's specifically involved with the crash retrieval aspect. So the question on my mind, and I'm guessing all of yours too, is why did this insider tell all of this to Michael? If this was a Psyop, why bring Michael all the way to this black site and show him all of this unknown stuff? And even if the insider is lying, this still does not account for Michael's experience seeing the UFO in 2009. That experience is not negated if this is a Psyop. To me, both sides of the coin seem somewhat logical and plausible. I often think back to the story of Paul Benowitz, who in 1989 was driven to insanity by being fed false information about extraterrestrials by the CIA. This is a fascinating story I might cover one day because it's really worth knowing. On the other hand, if this figure is pro-disclosure but does not want to be public, it does make sense for him to use Michael as a vessel. Let's see what Joey thinks. These guys don't want to come out publicly. They have a lot at risk. And personally, they have no interest in being like public figures about this topic. There are allegedly a lot of factions within the program who aren't interested in this becoming disclosed, and so there's personal risk with that as well. And so I think he saw in Michael someone who was already comfortable with that risk of being a whistleblower, and because he had that connection of understanding the operation that Michael had witnessed, felt that he would be a good person to try to reach out to. Something that raises suspicion about The Insider for both Joey and myself is the story of a book. A few weeks after the meeting, The Insider told Michael he was in the process of writing a book under a ghostwriter. The purpose of this book was to hide truth and fiction, similar to Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge. This book is titled Sentinels of Aether. What sticks out to me as concerning here is the book was framed to be corroborating evidence to support Michael's story, however, the connecting threads are thin at best. In fact, this book is about an event that occurred in Mexico in 2004 in which a paramilitary group in the Black Program wipe out an entire JSOC team during an operation. The Black team is described as transporting humans inside shipping containers to a hidden base in a mountain, which is similar to the containers Michael Herrera describes in his encounter. I didn't mention this earlier, but one of the things that Michael had been excited about with this meeting was he was supposedly going to be given some evidence that would support his claims. And the insider actually provided a two-chapter manuscript of the book currently under Dobser Review to remove classified information. In the insider's own words, he is playing a scheme or 4D chess on Dobser. And of course, for those of you who don't know, Dobser is the Defense Office of Pre-Publication and Security Review. This is what David Grush is currently going through with his op-ed right now, so he doesn't divulge any classified information. And he does provide some context as to the sort of scheme that he's trying to play on Dobser where he's intentionally, you know, including certain information that he knows, you know, shouldn't be flagged by Dobser because it's like deep black projects that shouldn't be acknowledged. And he's trying to see if they'll catch it. And it, I don't know, it just sounds, it just sounds a little sketchy, to be honest. In fact, the insider directly quotes, quote, our intention is to put the DoD in a pickle by creating dilemmas. We are strategically taking advantage of the fact they must respond. They don't have a choice. No poker face. Any response will provide us with information slash intelligence and inverse intelligence. One of the other things that Joey has more information on than almost anybody else are the thoughts and words of Michael's fellow platoon members who were with him in Indonesia in 2009. According to the original Daily Mail article that was written on Herrera, the other four or five Marines in Herrera's platoon were too scared to come forward. Bar one text message that read, quote, Hey man, this is asking too much of me. It's not worth the risk. My family and military career far exceed anything you are asking of me. It's not worth my life or jeopardizing my family. I know we go back, but this is asking too much. You need to get out of whatever you are in and don't get me involved. So I've talked to a handful of people who were in his platoon and were on that mission, on that ship. I would say not the UFO mission, the alleged UFO mission, but I'll say the Indonesia relief effort mission or operation. I will say that out of those people that I have spoken to, all of them believe Michael is lying, except for, well, except for one. There's one person that I've reached out to and asked for permission to ask some questions about it. And he just said, no, thank you and leave my name out of everything. But everyone else thinks Michael is lying. But the thing that's interesting is, you know, once I get into conversation with these people, they quickly reveal that, you know, because someone says very strongly, I know he's lying. My follow-up question is, oh, so you were boots on the ground with him in Indonesia? And their reply is, well, no, I was in a different squad or oh, no, I was, I was, I stayed on the ship. I didn't leave the ship. And so immediately I'm like, well, you can't possibly know he's lying because you weren't there. Like how can you say you know he's lying? So, you know, that was really disappointing to hear. However, I still, I still maintained conversations with these people because they did, you know, certain people provided some, you know, personal photographs that I was able to, you know, there was nothing crazy in the photographs, but it did prove that they were in, you know, the Taming Airport where the coordination efforts were happening. There's one person who I do find very credible who speaks against Michael. I'll just say his first name, his name's Nathan, and he was Michael's team leader. And he provided, so I've had several, you know, text conversations with him, and he provided a photograph that he alleges shows Michael and another Marine on a helicopter. And he says they're all being flown into Indonesia. They don't have rifles, right? This photograph is important because if it is proven to be Michael, it kind of shows that he's lying about something, you know, or, you know, most of the story gets kind of discredited because, you know, the big part of Michael's story was he had rifles and, you know, he was with different people. So Michael, you know, I did share that photograph with Michael. I didn't give him any contacts. I just said, do you know who's in this photograph? And he provided two names. And, you know, then I explained, you know, that the allegations that one of one of the people is him and, and he denies it, he very strongly denies it. And what's interesting to me to kind of play towards Michael in a way, let's say Nathan's telling the truth, let's say Michael did fly in with him without rifles. And let's say Michael was on that flight, right? What that would mean if he is lying about this UFO thing? That means he was thinking, let me, let me make up a story about a UFO, but also let me lie in about a mission I know I went on with my squad, even though he knows there were witnesses and he knows, you know, his photo is being taken. That just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why would he, like he could have very easily just said, yeah, that is me in the photograph, but I also took a different flight in later on or earlier in the day. You know, he could have made it so he could have just acknowledged that both things are true and it would have totally negated that photographic evidence. The question of rifles or lack thereof in Nathan's alleged photograph is crucial. Since Indonesia 2009 was a humanitarian mission, Marines were not supposed to be equipped with rifles. As I stated earlier, and what was actually confirmed to Joey by all the Marines he spoke to, the first wave of Marines in Indonesia were in fact armed, but subsequent deployments were not due to bad optics. Allegedly, an Air Force Colonel yelled at the Marines and ordered them to stop utilizing rifles. And now the reason why probably half of you are watching this video with a renewed interest in Michael Herrera, the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1. In this report, Michael Herrera is all but named as somebody who testified to Arrow stating quote, An interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said in that 2009, while participating in a humanitarian and security mission in a foreign country, he encountered U.S. special forces loading containers onto a large extraterrestrial spacecraft. And guys, I probably don't need to explain this to you, but Arrow Historical Report Volume 1 is not the most accurate report we've ever seen. In fact, in this two to three sentence summary of Michael Herrera, there are two factual inaccuracies. One, Michael never claimed he encountered U.S. special forces. What he said was he encountered men with American dialects. With American gear, but no rank, no insignia, no identifiers to where they belonged. And two, Herrera said, even from his first statement, he thought the craft he saw was human reverse engineered, not extraterrestrial. Is this just awful writing or purposeful disinformation? I lean more towards purposeful. I think this is so bogus and just in a two sentence summary, getting so many facts wrong. In my opinion, this sort of misreporting is on purpose and a symptom of the larger sickness that is this report. And I just want to touch on what seems to be a big misconception in the UAP community on Twitter and Reddit at the moment. On page 32, under the section, the UAP with peculiar characteristics refers to an authentic non-UAP related SAP. Some people are confusing this statement as describing Michael Herrera. In the statement, it says, Arrow was able to correlate this account with an authentic USG program because the interviewee was able to provide a relatively precise time and location. As first pointed out to me by Joey, Michael narrowed down the timing of the event to within a couple days, but he did not know the precise time. And Michael did not know the exact location of the landing zone in Indonesia. In the same section, whatever person was writing this error report stated that the seemingly strange characteristics reported by the interviewee matched closely with the platform's characteristics which was being tested at a military facility in the timeframe. The interviewee was there. But again, as Joey points out, Michael's encounter occurred in a remote part of the jungle in Indonesia, not a military facility. What was massively vindicating to Joey and something that made him place more trust in Michael, and he even relayed this to me months before the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1, Michael had actually told Joey and provided him proof that he had testified to Arrow. He said that they didn't record his testimony like they did. They weren't actually like electronically recording his testimony. There were just people in a skiff and some of them had notepads and were just like taking notes occasionally. So the summary of his testimony in the report could literally just be the result of poor note-taking and I am perfectly comfortable with accusing them of doing this intentionally because it certainly seems like something that they were trying to prevent as much of a paper trail as possible and leaving a lot of the records up to interpretation. I think that was 100% intentional. So I don't know if it was malicious misquoting of Michael or just literally poor note-taking and someone read someone else's notes and summarized and misinterpreted or whatever. Did he testify to Dr. Kirkpatrick or was it just Arrow employees? He says it was directly to Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the room. But another thing that I'll mention as well, something that I kind of caught was speaking of that statute that would provide penalties to anyone who lies, I noticed that Arrow was extremely careful in their report not to accuse a single whistleblower of lying or misleading. They emphasized how accepting they are of the fact that these whistleblowers believe what they're telling Arrow. And again, I think that was incredibly intentional. It was really like the first opening statement in the report. If you really highlight the key words there, it's literally all about belief. I'm just emphasizing belief and everyone's entitled to their belief and we can't criticize or hold it against anyone if they believe something. And that was intentional so that nobody could ... I previously asserted that Arrow would be forced to prosecute if they lied, but that's not really the case. I kind of misspoke there really. I think it would still would have made an opportunity for other lawyers or organizations to press charges against whistleblowers if they had lied and Arrow would be kind of in a position potentially to provide evidence that supports that assertion. So they wanted to make sure to avoid that at all costs and that's why they did that. Of course, I was fascinated to know if Michael had spoken to any other whistleblowers or people behind the scenes. While Joey understandably couldn't comment, he did tell me something interesting that kind of made me jump for joy. I do know that he has spoken to Jonathan Weighant, which was pretty interesting because they did have sort of similar experiences. So yeah, so that was really cool to think that Jonathan kind of had gotten the chance to speak with someone else that had a similar experience. I personally believe it is probable that Michael and Weighant encountered the same insider paramilitary group. Too many similarities to men with American dialects and all black gear that appear to have highly skilled backgrounds. Of course, in Weighant's case, he did specifically see men in DOE rain jackets, which allowed me to conclude that these are likely a DOE NES team. Again watch that analysis in my Marines video and then listen back to Michael's testimony and cross reference the two teams. And lastly guys, I kind of wanted to touch on some of the criticism that Joey has received. He has received so much support for his investigation, but also a lot of hate online. People calling him Michael's shill, people calling him Michael's publicist, or even Michael under a pseudonym. And understandably so, he's received some flak for receiving evidence, yet not making it public. Let's see what he has to say. I'm in no way his publicist. Yeah, I there's a few exceptions to that where there there were people that I felt would be good people to interview him. One of them is Chris Leto. So that was a case where I reached out to Chris and kind of did made the first contact and then introduced him. I just hope people will be open to continuing to just follow, you know, more as as the story unfolds because it's a very, it's a very interesting case because you not only do you have this historical event that happened in 2009 that still has a ton of data that is yet to be uncovered. Even by myself, you know, yes, there's things that I do have privately that I can't share, but there's also, you know, other data that hasn't been uncovered by myself or anyone. But now we have this kind of current thing that's unfolding as we speak. I mean, there are there are things happening right now behind the scenes as we speak. So I think I think it's incredibly interesting and worth paying attention to. And you know, no one has to make a decision about whether they think it's true or false at this point. I've been taking this a lot more seriously than I ever did previously, and I am giving the benefit of the doubt to the other people involved behind the scenes. And I'm and I am taking them very seriously. And I'm respecting anybody's request for me not to reveal certain information because that's that's just the right thing to do. And people criticize me. And it's and it it kills me because I totally understand the criticism. I can't even argue the criticism because I did make the decision to kind of have this compromise where I'd reach out to people like yourself and other, you know, podcasters and journalists and people who I trust and, you know, reveal my identity, you know, you and I, we had a we've we've had video calls, you've seen my face, you know, who I am. And I've shared some information with you that backs up some of my evidence of or, you know, shared some of my evidence that backs up my opinions on certain things. And so really, as the best compromise I could come up with, you know, for now, I do hope to get to a point where I can be public and share more evidence. But for right now, that that was kind of the best compromise I could come up with. And one last thing I'd like to touch on is the connection between Michael Herrera and Stephen Greer. I've touched upon this in almost every single one of my videos where there is a whistleblower, even my Marines video because of Jonathan Wagon. So if you're interested to hear more, go check any of those out. But I think it's important to start separating the whistleblowers from Dr. Greer. It's no surprise I have my problems with Dr. Greer, but I'm trying to take an approach where I will individually vet whistleblowers and people separate from Greer. I see a lot of people saying that these two are in cahoots, which is just blatantly not true. In fact, Michael himself has said that Dr. Greer has embellished or purposefully lied about details of his story. There's been some interviews that Dr. Greer has done and everything like that, where he's told people that they put guns right to our head. That wasn't the case. These guys were at a standoff distance because it's easier to go like this than actually be at a standoff distance and try to rush somebody who has had a good distance that can sight in and just shoot you. So we need to understand that Dr. Greer is probably one of the only avenues whistleblowers have to come forward that they know of before David Grush. Hopefully things change in the future and people start pursuing the avenues of Grush or maybe Carl Nell or maybe if there's some changes arrow. But it's important to kind of separate Herrera from Greer. I would like to thank him for trusting me with some of the more sensitive evidence regarding Herrera. This case is ongoing and I don't imagine there's going to be just one follow-up video he and I make to this. Michael Herrera's case has almost consumed me of late. I think about it all the time. I studied all the time and I talk to Joey about it all the time. So this case is so fascinating to me. I can't believe I initially brushed it off by buying into the Greer hate or buying into some of the kind of nonsensical thoughts of just diminishing his testimony and thinking he's fully because of some details that seem odd at first when hearing about his story. I am still torn on the insider in terms of is this guy conducting a psyop or telling Michael real information. I just don't have enough evidence right now to know. But what do you guys think after hearing some more of this video and hearing from Joey, do you guys believe more in Michael or less? Has his credibility increased or decreased in your eyes? I'd love to hear from you guys because this case is so fascinating to me. Please guys remember to like and subscribe and if you're interested in supporting the channel, I have made a Patreon.

People started confiding in me, they approached me, I have plenty of current former senior intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career, that confided in me they were a part of a program, they named the program, I've never heard of it. Forget little green men, forget Area 51, forget Bob Lazar, and get any sort of conspiracy out of your mind for just a second. It's no longer just speculation or even a secret that within the US Department of Defense lies a shadowy UFO reverse engineering and crash retrieval program with access so exclusive, only a couple hundred people in the 80 plus year history of the program has ever been read in. People like David Grush and legislation like Schumer's 2024 NDAA legacy programs have helped turn a former conspiracy into an outrageous fact. Sometimes it feels like details, names, and operations of these programs will never come to life, that those in the know in the defense industry will cling to secrecy until they're dying breaths. Though actually receiving transparency may sometimes feel like a distant fever dream, you know your host UAP Gerb has you. Join me today and we will venture into Project Moondust and follow the astounding paper trail of one possible DOD UFO crash retrieval program. Edward J. Ruppelt conducted the first ever official US government study into the UFO phenomena under Project Grudge in 1948 to 1949. He went on to serve as the director of Project Sign and Blue Book, the subsequent US government official UFO investigation programs in the 20th century. During his time as director, Ruppelt concluded UFOs had a quote interplanetary explanation. On the 24th of April 1952, Ruppelt suggested programs parallel to the official USG investigation were quote, conducting a more complete investigation. This same conclusion was derived by J. Allen Heineck, the scientific advisor to Project Blue Book. We talked about him in the alien and UFOs obscure oddities iceberg layer two, so if you want to know more, read there. But Heineck additionally said that alongside Blue Book, there were other classified programs going on studying UFOs. One of these projects could have been an inconspicuous crash retrieval program, one that unless you look hard enough, you'll never know existed, and that of course is Project Moondust. The first mention of Moondust can be traced back to 1961 in a US Air Force document titled AFCIN-1E-0 Draft Policy. This proposal suggests that the USAF 1127th received collection responsibility duties for the USAF's established program for investigation of reliably reported unidentified flying objects within the United States. The memo also lists one project that has historically had this duty. That project is Moondust, which has the authority to locate, recover, and deliver descended foreign space vehicles. And as we can see in this 1967 review for the Assistant Chief of Staff for the Intelligence Community, which details the functions of the 1127th USAF Field Activities Group, Moondust is shown to not just be a proposal, but exists, and has historically dealt with some terrestrial space vehicles. In fact, in the 1967 year, Moondust captured a total of 49 fallen Soviet space objects and 17 US space objects. And this is followed by a large redacted portion of the memo. Now we know that Moondust had real collection responsibilities with Soviet American and redacted space vehicles. So let's start to take a look at some of Moondust's work. As early as 1961, Moondust was in fact investigating UFOs and acting on UFO reports. In this internal memo, in Pakistan, on April 25, 1961, Moondust recorded observations of three cigar-shaped UFOs flying in a close delta formation above Karachi, Pakistan. But Moondust wasn't just investigating UFO reports. In fact, it was actively engaged in UFO collection. Let's travel to 1968 in Nepal. In this memo, the Defense Intelligence Department monitors a crashed circular metal disc discovered in Nepal. Four months after, the State Department cable titled Moondust, right to the DIA, 1127th, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base that a diplomatic visit to Kathmandu, Nepal, was a, quote, fishing expedition for info on space objects. Additional cables show Royal Nepali Army showed photos of these space objects to US offices. A possible cover story was then constructed here of a crashed satellite, despite NORAD and NASA data showing a 100% successful satellite launch rate in 1968. Unfortunately the trail stops here, so I cannot tell you if this circular metal disc was actually recovered by US entities. Now let's fast forward a little bit to the 1970s. In Canada in 1976, a memo achieved via the Freedom of Information Act shows that Moondust wrote to Canadian officials requesting photos of space-related metals originating from a non-US, quote, satellite. That would be of particular interest to USF foreign technology divisions at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and to the CIA's Office of Weapon Intelligence. Now Canada has historically been very open on investigating UFOs and participating in UFO analysis with other Five Eyes nations, but that is another video for another day. I want you to take particular note of the last two entries and how various memos and cables have been written to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. If you remember an entry from Layer 2 of the Alien and UFOs of Skiur-Ottodies Iceberg, you remember that Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is connected with the phenomena. Wright-Patterson is often seen as a hub where crash retrievals of UFOs are stored. Think of the Roswell case. Allegedly, the crash materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. And think of Senator Barry Goldwater, who asked Wright-Patterson officials to see the room where, quote, it was stored and was laughed off and told never to ask again. Now if we fast forward to 1978 in New Zealand, Moondust investigates space fragments found in New Zealand described as spherical or like a pressure vessel. Note how this pressure vessel shape is very similar to Commander David Fraver's tic-tac sighting, in which he describes the craft he observed as similar to a propane tank or pressure vessel without any inlets or outlets. And finally we arrive at my favorite case involving Project Moondust. Everybody has heard about the Roswell crash. Now not everybody knows most countries have their own sort of Roswell story in which some sort of anomalous craft has hit the ground and some sort of retrieval is underway. You can think of Canada's Shag Harbor for instance, maybe I'll make a video on Roswells around the world if you're interested, but you may have never heard of the 1978 Bolivia UFO crash. This alleged retrieval was brought to my attention by the work of the UAP Caucus, a legislative group on UAP initiative backed by members of Congress including Representative Timbershet, Rep Anna Paulina Luna, Rep Eric Bertelsen, and Rep Jared Moskowitz. The story famous in Bolivia goes. On May 6, 1978 at 4.15pm, thousands of people near El Tayer Bolivia witnessed a cylindrical object crash into the mountainside, creating a sonic boom that was heard up to 150 miles away and cracked window panes as far as 30 miles in radius. A local army corporal named Natalio Ruiz actually witnessed the UFO. Sane flew above his head and resembled a gigantic wine container emitting a trace of white smoke. Bolivian military and three jets were dispatched to check the wreckage. Upon discovering the wreckage, the local military and police were quoted as sane. Our men have discovered the object and inspected it, but have received no further instruction or further action. It is a dull metallic cylinder, 12 feet long with a few dents. No one knows what is inside it, and we are waiting the arrival of various technical commissions. A NASA expert is also expected to arrive tomorrow morning. And of course, two U.S. Army Air Force officers, Colonel Robert Simmons and Major Jesse Hayes, arrived. Subsequently, secret documents finally obtained through the Freedom of Information Act were sent to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. In this document, Vance writes that appropriate government agencies have been contacted regarding this crash. And I'm sure that you can guess the appropriate agency, Moondust. Moondust received a film showing the object by the Bolivian military, and were tasked with monitoring the situation. Unfortunately, the trail of Moondust's involvement with this fascinating case ends here. I don't know if they retrieved this craft or did nothing else. I don't know. And it absolutely eats at me that I can't find out what happened. Let's skip forward to 1992. New Mexico Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici made inquiries to the Air Force about Project Moondust. In response, the Air Force said that there is no Project Moondust. These missions have never existed. The Senators responded with documents challenging this, and the Air Force revised its previous statement acknowledging the existence and function of Moondust with regards to UFOs. Then in 1994, Senator Domenici requested 11 documents pertaining to Moondust from the Air Force. The Air Force claimed that the projects no longer existed, nor do their files. Classified reports that may have possibly existed were destroyed. But this is categorically false. Why would the Air Force state that documents had been destroyed when requested by a U.S. Senator? Why did the Air Force deny the existence of Project Moondust? And why did they cling on to claiming that any record of the program was destroyed? I've thought about this. And do you remember in the Wilson Davis video, when Admiral Thomas Wilson claims that in the early 90s, special access programs were reorganized to hide the crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs within SAPOX, basically making them inaccessible to everybody? When did these Senators ask for documents on Moondust, the mid-90s? Were these documents destroyed and any sort of involvement denied by the Air Force occur because of this reorganization and compartmentalization of programs? I think so. It's also important to note that in this time from 1969 to 2008, Project Blue Book to OSAP, there was no official U.S. government UAP investigation group. So this is what I'd like to consider the dark ages, the completely hidden era of UFO investigation. The Air Force clung on to denying the existence of Moondust. And that is where our paper trail ends. It's quite plausible that the Air Force destroyed the majority of files pertaining to Moondust. In order to hide a crash retrieval program of UFOs. My friends, thank you for joining me to take a look through Project Moondust. I hope you learned something today. I hope you learned that, you know, even though sometimes it may seem impossible to crack what the United States government and defense industry and intelligence industry have been up to in regards to UFOs, it is possible with enough digging. I want to know in the comments what you guys think. Do you think Moondust has historically been, or was at least at one point, responsible for collecting UAP, or do you think it was just involved in collecting foreign and domestic space vehicles because I do not? I absolutely do not. There's a couple other programs such as Zodiac, Blue Fly, the CIA's Office of Global Access, and a couple more unacknowledged programs I'd like to cover in the future, so stay tuned for that. But please, if you don't mind, give a like and subscribe, it really helps the channel and I am astounded at how this community has grown so far. It's incredible to see people with the same passion for UFOs that I have kind of engaged in the comments and watch these videos, so I gotta give you my deepest gratitude, because I am forever thankful. I will catch you guys for the next video, and thank you for tuning in, bye.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/6ZuHLgVtKu8/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Alien</li> <li>Barry Goldwater</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Cyrus Vance</li> <li>David Fraver</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>Domenici</li> <li>Edward J.

These programs seem to take many forms, including crash recovery of non-human vehicles, material exploitation of technologies of unknown origin, reverse engineering of anomalous craft, and construction of copycat vehicles famously known as alien reproduction vehicles, ARVs. On this channel, we have discussed myriad major range and test facility bases and defense laboratories and centers where such programs are likely located. We have also discussed at length contractors, FFRDCs, and UARCs that are alleged to operate alongside the CIA and NSA across Army, Navy, and Air Force UFO programs. When such clandestine and secretive operations to master non-human technology have led to, in David Grush's words, a multi-decade secret Cold War, where might these programs be located? The logistics of maintaining secrecy and strict need to know access for unacknowledged special access programs focused on anomalous research, development, test, and evaluation of non-human technologies and storage of non-human craft and possibly biologics are likely tremendous. For this reason, we must look underground and evaluate the decades of rumors and testimonies of UFOs and deep underground military bases, or DUMMS. DUMMS have served as a continuous focus of this channel with recent discussion and direct investigation into dugway-proving ground. The United States premier chemical and biological testing range and its alleged 1,300 square mile subterranean facility and remote entrance in the desert. For this investigation, we will be continuously referencing the work of Dr. Richard Sotter and his three masterpieces titled Underground Bases and Tunnels, What is the Government Trying to Hide? Hidden in Plain Site Beyond the X-Files and Underground and Underwater Bases. These three dense pieces give us keen context into subterranean bases in the form of stringent fact-based analysis through publicly available records, FOIA documents, declassified documents, and the occasional witness testimony. Deep underground military bases do indeed exist. This is fact and we will explore this fact today, but do these sites engage with UFO legacy programs? And if so, which DoD sites and what do they do? And could the decades of rumors regarding underground tunnels connecting these clandestine sites through an internal rail system possibly be true? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so very much for joining me today as we embark into the world of the subterranean to investigate DUMs and UFOs. The subject of UFO legacy sites embedded into mountains with hidden hangars sequestered a mile beneath the Earth's surface or hidden anywhere out of the public and satellite view has long been a talking point of this channel in my investigations. Today, we finally look below the Earth's surface to evaluate the existence, feasibility, and operations of UFO legacy programs and deep underground military bases. To borrow from the title of the first chapter of Dr. Richard Sotter's Underground Bases and Tunnels, deep underground military bases are indeed real. Throughout this project, I will be interchangeably using the terms DUM and subterranean facility or stiff. The name said to me by multiple veterans who have traveled to such underground locations. And speaking of, I should mention, I have spoken to nearly half a dozen former military personnel who have traveled to stiffs across the country. I try to shy away from inserting first hand source testimony and anecdotes into my videos and let evidence and research speak for itself, so I will interject with these first hand testimonies when and if necessary. In a 1989 speech titled Underground Facilities for Defense, Experience and Lessons, Deputy Director of Engineering and Construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Lloyd A. Dusha said, quote, After World War II, political and economic factors changed the underground construction picture and caused a renewed interest to think underground. As a result of this interest, the Corps of Engineers became involved in the design and construction of some very complex and interesting military projects, end quote. In the same talk, Dusha would then go on to exclaim, quote, Although the conference program indicates the topic to be underground facilities for defense, experience and lessons, I must deviate a little because several of the most interesting facilities that have been designed and constructed by the Corps are still classified, end quote. Acknowledged military subterranean facilities do indeed exist. Publicly known sites include the Norad Cheyenne Mountain Complex buried deep under Colorado Springs. This enormous installation built to monitor North American missile threats sits 2,000 feet underground and spans 5.1 acres, featuring six three-story high and 40 foot wide tunnels and 15 three-story buildings made of steel plates. And these are just the acknowledged portions of the base. Additionally, the Raven Rock Complex, aka Site R, serves as a secure underground command center or backup Pentagon and is shrouded in mystery. This site under Fort Detrick, Maryland includes accommodations for 3,000 people, has an inbuilt medical and dental clinic, fire department, post office and five acknowledged three-story buildings. The secrets Raven Rock must hold are endless, but existing acknowledged dumps are not the focus of today's investigation. Instead, we plan to pursue dumps that operate as UFO legacy program locations and explore the feasibility of decades of rumors of hundreds, if not thousands of miles of underground tunnels and railroads connecting deep underground UFO legacy operations. To once again quote, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Deputy Director for Engineering and Construction Lloyd A. Dusha, when speaking about the Corps' involvement in the 1960s construction of the Cheyenne site, quote. As stated earlier, there are other projects of similar scope, which I cannot identify, but which include multiple chambers up to 50 feet wide and 100 feet high, using the same excavation procedure mentioned for the NORAD facility, end quote. After all, according to a 1985 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report titled Literature Survey of Underground Construction Methods for Application to Harden Facilities, STIFs can be built anywhere with the right amount of money and in myriad types of structures utilizing deep shaft structures and facilities tunneled into mountain sides. The report even states, quote, since adequate technology is available to construct hardened underground facilities under virtually any ground conditions, the main constraint in construction projects remains economic viability rather than technical feasibility, end quote. As we know from David Grush and multiple other sources and testimonies, UFO legacy programs operate on the U.S. Black budget. Untraceable, deep-sixed money and contracts buried within special access, controlled access and unacknowledged special access programs. From the excellent work of Catherine Austin Fitz, I mention often, we also know that as much as $21 trillion in unauthorized spending has occurred between 1998 and 2015. And this is just within the DOD and Department of Housing and Urban Development, much of which Fitz believed was designated for clandestine military R&amp;D. Publicly denied UFO, research development, test and evaluation underground locations would absolutely classify as such. Dumbs for clandestine and unacknowledged use is also a practice very much currently in play. One such example is Warrenton U.S. Army Training Center located in the northern Virginia town of Warrenton. The book The Secret Team, the CIA and its allies in control of the world by Fletcher Prouty, identified a highly secretive underground installation that serves as a federal relocation center by an unknown agency. This was confirmed in an inquiry magazine article titled Going Underground by Robert Walters, which plainly states that U.S. Army Warrenton Training Center is a CIA covert facility. Additionally, there is the highly secretive U.S. Navy underground facility in the mountains of West Virginia near Sugar Grove. This location is an underground site run by the Navy for the National Security Agency, so the NSA and CIA already have a traceable interest in using U.S. military bases underground facilities as a cover for unknown usage in operations. So before discussing much of the testimony of UFOs and Dumbs, let's quickly touch on the reality and history of these impressive, often unacknowledged sites. The inception of Dumbs in the United States can actually be traced back to the Nazis, an operation paperclip, the famous program to recruit Nazi scientists, engineers, and technicians into U.S. government employment. Near the end of World War II, the Nazis had begun utilization of what we might call Dumbs. In the book Lucky Forward, The History of Patent's Third Army, Colonel Robert S. Allen detailed Allied discoveries of Nazi underground bases, quote, the underground installations were amazing. They were literally subterranean towns. There were four in and around Ordruf. None were natural caverns or mines. All were man-made military installations. The horror camp had provided the labor. An interesting feature of the construction was the absence of any spoil. It had been carefully scattered into hills miles away, end quote. Some Nazi installations were over 50 feet underground, comprised of several miles of two to three story facilities. The sites were arranged like wheels with spokes designed with reinforced concrete. The Nazis designed such locations as Ordruf to house Nazi high command after the bombing of Berlin, but never got the chance to populate the facility. We additionally have the Regenwurm Lager, or Earthworm Camp in Poland. This Nazi sprawling underground complex beneath West Poland's full extent is still unknown today. The site featured miles of underground tunnels and electrical train lines connecting bunkers, fortifications, and other critical military facilities. This sounds familiar, no? Two declassified documents can be discovered dating back to 1947 regarding the aforementioned Operation Paperclip. Featured in the documents are requests by Air Material Command for a quote unquote requirement of four German technicians to consult on a planned underground plant program. One man named was Xavier Dorsch, director of the TOT organization in the closing of World War Two. This was the Nazi's equivalent of the US Navy Seabees, or US Army Corps of Engineers, but not part of formal German military structure. The founder of this organization, Fritz Tott, designed the famous German Autobahn Highway System. Towards the tail end of World War Two, Dorsch had helped with developing a series of massive underground industrial manufacturing facilities to hide from Allied bombing raids. It is indeed quite possible he also aided on the Regenwurm Lager and Ordruf. Documents and research show Dorsch once briefed the Americans after he was captured in 1945 and again in 1949, we do not know the full extent to which he aided in these programs. These massive Nazi underground industrial manufacturing facilities possibly give us our first look into UFO legacy programs and dums. I have covered on this channel the 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO crash retrieval, a case whose validity is strongly supported by David Grush. You said it's a 90 year cover up. Just about, yeah. 90 years. 1933 was the first recovery in Europe in Magenta, Italy. They recovered a partially intact vehicle. In this case, the Nazis purportedly took control of a crashed lenticular disk from the Italians in 1943 before being recovered by the Americans post war. Hans Kamler was a Nazi engineer behind construction of numerous concentration camps, including Auschwitz and led myriad Nazi secret weapons projects. Kamler would have indeed been one of chief scientists and engineers to study a recovered lenticular craft due to his unrivaled command over Nazi secret weapons programs. Kamler went missing near the tail end of World War Two. However, documents prove rather convincingly this evil engineer was taken alive into US custody. Albert Speer, Nazi and Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production claimed in April 1945, Kamler informed him he had business to offer the Americans. OSS agent Donald W. Richardson seemingly confirmed this by stating 70 years after he still couldn't fully speak on interrogating Kamler. But the Nazis had brought treasure to the US that, quote, served the development of armament platforms for the Cold War and for the future, end quote. Under Kamler's command, numerous underground tunnels and bases existed, employing German companies to develop and build parts for advanced aircraft and secret weapons programs. Kamler is even said to have stashed treasures and documents regarding his think tanks top secret documents in a facility underground in the woods of Czechoslovakia. According to Hidden Nazi by Dan Ruder, 44 years after Operation Hidden documents to retrieve these stashed top secret documents, an American team from Lawrence Livermore Labs and Los Alamos Labs to FFRDCs went to a new underground cavern that had not been emptied at the end of World War Two called Mednick Hill. What was found here was, quote, the key to what was hidden at the previous site, end quote. It goes without saying it stands to reason Kamler conducted early iterations of UFO legacy programs underneath Mednick Hill, as well as his numerous underground locations and tunnels, and that Xavier Dorsch was a key engineer in constructing these facilities. With Dorsch being requested by air material command and Kamler being more than likely secretly smuggled by the Americans, these two men could very well be the key architects of modern day US UFO and dumb legacy programs. I am no expert in history, so to learn more about Kamler, I strongly recommend watching the documentary The Two Lives of Hans Kamler. Later in this project, we will see even more ties between Nazi Germany, Dumbs, and Paperclip than in the form of Maglev train systems. On numerous occasions in the 1950s, the United States proposed massive underground facilities that seemingly disappeared from public light. It is unknown if many of these facilities were built or not. One example can be traced to 1957 to Green Mountain outside Huntsville, Alabama. Huntsville is deeply enshrouded in US anti-gravity research, but we are looking elsewhere. Two articles in 1957 reported the US Army was planning to build a rocket factory inside of Green Mountain. The plan was proposed by the American Machine and Foundry Company, Redstone Arsenal, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This location was slated to have a sort of subterranean junior Pentagon, where elaborate headquarters would be installed to direct the defense of the southern US from enemy attack. Again, it is unknown if this location was ever built. However, such discussion of a junior Pentagon illustrated early private military cooperation, a theme we will touch on much more much later. Analysis of US military and underground studies additionally allows us valuable insights into DUMMS. Take the RAND Corporation for example. An FFRDC I have spoken about ad nauseam is a primary semi-government institution up to its eyeballs in UFO legacy programs. RAND Corporation was established in 1948 and grew out of Army Air Force Project RAND in 1946. Project RAND sought to carry out long-range research projects of interest to the Air Force. In the 1950s, USAF and RAND began working on the question of underground-based construction and organized various symposiums. Let's analyze a resulting 1959 publication, Deep Underground Construction. The purpose of such a symposium, according to the chairman, was to discuss, quote, the problems of protecting military installations located deep underground or under mountains, end quote, in the event of nuclear war. The chairman also stated, since 1957, the RAND corp had been, quote, actively investigating the need for a small number of super hard, deep underground centers, end quote. Additionally, in 1960, RAND published a study under USAF contract dealing 12 locations for underground sites. All sites were assumed to be more than 1000 feet deep. Of specific interest here is site three in Santa Barbara, California. Santa Barbara is located just over 100 miles from the Antelope Valley, California. We will discuss later. Research suggests a major network of UFO-focused stiff facilities exists interconnected under the antelope. Site three is also located less than 100 miles away from Los Angeles, where a tremendous amount of DoD research development tests and evaluation laboratories lie. We have already mentioned the US Army Corps of Engineer giving in 1989 a quite frank admission of classified underground facilities. An outside of the 1987 US Army Corps of Engineer report detailing construction of Dumbs boils down to cost. In 1959 to 1961, the Army Corps of Engineer published a five-part training manual titled, Design of Underground Installations in Rock. This startling series assumes the pre-existence of underground facilities. The report states, quote, vital government installations have been placed underground as exemplified by the Richie Project, end quote. Many of these facilities were designed as command and control centers and survival bunkers for nuclear attacks. These are known as continuity of government sites. Raven Rock qualifies as one such continuity of government or COG DUM. Design of underground installations in rock additionally makes some statements of extreme relevance to the testimonies of Dumbs and UFOs. Some installations listed by the Army were to be shallow, while, quote, more important equipment and facilities essential to defense may be installed in deeper workings that are likely to be long and tunnel-like, occupying one or several stories, end quote. The report detailed enormous underground facilities featuring 50 by 50 feet tunnels and chambers as much as 100 feet high, even stating, quote, truck or rail traffic might be important, end quote. The Army even cautioned, quote, landscape scars, roads and portal structures, aka entrances, should be as inconspicuous as possible. Camouflage should be considered, end quote. This is of extreme consequence when discussing testimonies such as MS, who detailed the entrance to the Dugway Stiff as a small building in the middle of nowhere. In 1963, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a manual titled, Utilization of Nuclear Power Plants in Underground Installations. This manual discussed self-contained nuclear-powered underground facilities with button-up diesel secondary systems. Critically, in 1964, the Army Corps of Engineers or COE proposed 12 massive structures to be built up to 4,000 feet underground. There are two sites here of massive importance to our investigation, one facility below Yuma County, Arizona, to be accessed via a vertical or incline shaft. Such entry points are common amongst claims of UFO dum, such as the Dugway Dumb, whose entrance is purported to be a vertical elevator shaft. In Stephen Greer's DPI archive, who fans of this channel will know I have extracted a tremendous amount of information and worthwhile investigation from, witness 10773 statement reads, quote, nose of massive research and storage facility, material of unknown origin at Yuma Proving Ground, end quote, fascinating connection here. Yuma Test Center is also home to Yuma Proving Ground, a U.S. Army major range and test facility base, similar to Dugway Proving Ground's Army MRTFB, the West Desert Test Center. Yuma Proving Ground is also run by Army Test and Evaluation Command. Indeed, it is no stretch to assume if a stiff exists under one of these Army MRTFBs, an equally impressive facility likely exists below the other. Second here is Site III in Inyo County, California, to be accessed via incline shaft. Inyo County resides on the inside boundary of China Lake Naval Weapons Testing Facility. China Lake is one of the Navy's premier major range and test facility base and a location spoken of on myriad occasions as an underground legacy program location. China Lake really needs no introduction, but stay tuned as we will discuss China Lake in much more detail along with Antelope Valley. But quickly to mention, Dr. Richard Sotter received testimony from a Navy contact who served at China Lake. The witness confirmed an impressively large and deep installation, claiming the facility extends one mile deep and contains, quote, weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons, end quote. Alongside the US Army's COE, the US Navy is also deeply entwined with underground and possibly undersea bases, but that's another story for another day. In 1972, Naval Facilities Engineering Command issued a report titled, Sub-Surface Deployment of Naval Facilities, discussing several Navy installations to be placed underground. These include administration, medical, aircraft maintenance, ammo storage, and miscellaneous storage facilities. The US Navy Seabees additionally maintain underground installations between the Presidential Camp David and CIA facility Camp Peary, which we will discuss later on. In 1947, US Air Material Command requested Nazi technicians for construction of underground facilities. In 1989, Lloyd Dusha admitted numerous underground installations existed and were classified. This means stiffs of interest were built from 1947 to 1949, a 42-year period. We can also assume some facilities were built before 1961 where the five-part Army-COE document assumes the existence of such facilities. One such example here may be Groom Lake Area 51 that was built in the 50s on the site of a former Boron mine. After all, a 1991 DARPA report details secret cavities may be found in conjunction with underground mines. However, due to the existence of literature on described future plans for massive bases post-1961 that really hold our interest, we can assume from 1961 to 1989 the majority of our stiffs of interest were constructed. Dumbs are not a new subject to the study of UFOs or my channel. I myself have talked a tremendous amount of the alleged DARSE Defense Advanced Research Center, a 10-story underground location built under Area 51 relayed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet that dealt with alien reproduction vehicles, including the TR-3B. I have also spoken on the enigmatic Northrop Tahan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities that have since at least 1987 been accused by excellent researchers such as Bill Hamilton as housing UFO legacy programs, and don't worry, we will touch on these facilities in much more detail later. Quite recently, I've discussed the Dugway Dumb as relayed by Witness MS and even provided images and details of the exact alleged entrance to the facility, which exists as an elevator shaft concealed by a tiny building in the middle of nowhere Dugway near German village. As strange as that might seem, a 1991 paper issued by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and US Army Missile Command titled Development of Inspection and Detection Techniques for Hidden Cavities. This document served to train field nuclear weapons inspectors to identify underground clandestine test complexes in developing nuclear nations. The report plainly states buildings of various size can provide cover for shafts or other openings to a secret underground cavity, sounds similar to MS, no? And lastly, I have relayed the testimony of Randy Anderson in the underground facility under the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane housing the alleged Off-World Technologies Division. The subject of underground UFO legacy programs rose to prominence in 1989 with the claims of Bob Lazar and reverse engineering under Site 4, as well as the Dulce base fiasco where starting in 1979, Paul Benowitz was fed disinformation of a joint human extraterrestrial base under Dulce, New Mexico. Both S4 and Dulce are worthy of further investigation. In fact, I believe S4 to be a very real location, but due to the controversy around these accounts, discussions of these sites will be largely omitted from today's discussions. The first true mention of DUMs and UFOs I can find is from Look Magazine in an article titled Is This The Real Flying Saucer? dated 1955. The article discussed a Canadian company constructing a flying saucer while also depicting a facility built underneath a hill with a vertical shaft to the surface allowing the departure of flying saucers. Further rumors of UFOs and DUMs wouldn't really arise until the 1970s, so this article is indeed intriguing. Leonard Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval Status Reports 1-7 is a body of work I often praise extensively. After all, Stringfield is in my opinion one of the greatest UFO investigators of all time. His work on UFO retrieval incidents and operations spanned from 1978 to 1994 and relays some of the earliest mentions I can find of deep underground legacy operations. Let's briefly explore a few. One such intriguing report is an anonymous letter Stringfield received 12 February 1974. The letter highlighted secret research on UFOs taking place at a secret underground complex below Gray Army Airfield and Fort Hood, Texas. According to the witness, the complex is shared with ICBM silos built into a small mountain. This is fascinating as later in the project we will discuss how numerous DUMs were constructed primarily as ICBM sites. The witness described a section of the mountain would open up onto a jet interceptor runway, which was once accidentally observed by a private pilot making a forced landing over this restricted air corridor. This underground facility, according to the witness, was tied with NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, and others. And this is where the anonymous account gets very interesting. The witness stated the complex employed a squadron of unmarked helicopters dispatched quote when the need arises and quote codenamed the blue boys. This sounds incredibly similar to UFO recovery rapid reaction units I have spoken about in numerous crash retrieval cases such as the Blue Berets in the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania case. The choppers additionally carried a new type of missile the source had been informed had been used on UFOs but a new system had been in development which would be far more efficient. This was an electronic warfare system designed to disable UFOs under quote unquote controlled conditions. This letter would arrive to Stringfield's desk in 1974 but now in 2025 we have heard the whistleblower testimony of Jake Barber where he discussed EMP type weapons designed to bring down UFOs over the enigmatic range. In your time in deployment you met certain people from an aerospace company, didn't you? Yes I did. Now it's also part of the constraints you operate under that you can't name that aerospace company. There's no good reason to name them even if I wasn't constrained. What were they doing there? Well they were supporting us with some new weapons technology that could be used to disable vehicles and aircraft. I can disclose this my understanding is that they were essentially using it was actually I think it's a matter of public record that microwave weapons pulse microwave weapons were being used at that time. Correct there were some early prototypes that were being used at that time and I met individuals that were there representing the companies that were providing that service to the government, made some friends and those relationships led to opportunities later in the California desert where I began my journey. Leonard would actually see a volume of reports regarding underground complexes at Fort Hood including a USAF Lieutenant Colonel who relate to him in 1975 of an underground project that took place at Fort Hood. In 1976 Stringfield met an individual from McGregor Texas who claimed his father had worked beneath Fort Hood on the UFO program. This second-hand witness relayed a quote from his father stating quote the technology that is being applied in this underground complex would remind someone of a science fiction thriller. It is unbelievable what they know and what they can do from this area. Spanning the late 70s into the 80s Stringfield received myriad reports of an underground facility beneath Wright Patterson Air Force Base housing preserved non-human biologics. One such account was relayed from witness JK who worked at a Nike missile site in Wilmington, Ohio. JK claimed to have seen nine alien bodies under Wright Pad in 1966 encased in glass frozen to preserve. JK also claimed recovered craft were housed at McDill Air Force Base Langley Air Force Base in Seymour Johnson Navy Training Center outside of Norfolk, Virginia. These locations purportedly all housed craft and sometimes biologics and underground hangers to conceal material from military and politicians. Stringfield heard similar accounts of biologics under Wright Pat relayed second hand from one TS who allegedly witnessed bodies in the early 1950s. TS were amongst a handful that relayed such stories. Leonard Stringfield would also once receive an anonymous undated letter from a U.S. airman who is stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The source relayed rumors and stories of UFOs being stored in the Manzano storage area in remote Kirtland. Remember if you will, Kirtland is home to Sandia National Labs, FFRDC, which ranging from the interplanetary phenomenon unit report to accusations of reverse engineering a propulsion device for the TR-3B by Edgar Fouchet has stood as a high probability candidate in UFO RDT&amp;E programs. Manzano Mountain Underground Facility is no myth either. While researching for his 2001 book Underwater and Underground Bases, solder received FOIA documents of two underground facilities below Manzano. While these documents of course say nothing about UFO storage, it is fascinating to see solder confirm the rumors of an underground installation beneath Kirtland. Lastly, I want to reference an anonymous letter to Leonard Stringfield I have covered before. This is dated March 14, 1975, which claims to recount the testimony of one Lieutenant Colonel Sims, Asunim. I previously discussed this letter in reference to the project on ED. An Edwards Air Force Base 412th Test Group Electronic Warfare Test Director who claimed to the existence of a joint UFO reverse engineering program operating between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range. Viewers of this channel will know I consider ED to be one of the most critical UFO legacy witnesses of all time and as a quick side note, ED also referenced attending the S-4 site. This letter was referenced due to the mention of Handscom Air Force Base in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An Air Base and University where ED worked from 2002 to 2005 on foreign military assets. Amongst the intriguing mentions of contractors, FFRDCs, UARCs, and air bases involved in UFO research and investigation, the source relayed Lieutenant Colonel Sims speaking of several computer banks hidden within underground installations scattered across the US, housing sophisticated computer equipment, electronic instrumentation, and mobile radar units. According to Sims, these underground installations employ, quote, squadrons of unmarked helicopters which have sophisticated instrumentation on board that are dispatched to areas of UFO activity to monitor these craft or airlift them out of the area if one has malfunctioned, end quote. This sounds quite similar to the Blue Boy's rapid reaction unit related to Stringfield, does it not? But perhaps we have other confirming evidence so let's also reference the book Trinity's Children Living Along America's Nuclear Highways. The authors of this book state, quote, there are more crazed supercomputers in New Mexico, an Air Force computer expert once said than anywhere else. They're here at the Weapon Center referring to Kirtland, they're across the street at Sandia, they're at Los Alamos up the highway, and they're at the, quote, underground places nobody knows about. Intriguing as we already know Kirtland and by extension Sandia employ at least two underground facilities in the Manzano Mountains. Los Alamos National Labs additionally employs a deep underground installation. Dr. Sotter had quite an interesting engagement with Los Alamos. He repeatedly attempted to FOIA the Department of Energy for information on underground facilities and tunnels beneath Los Alamos. The DOE continuously responded there were none. Eventually though, the DOE provided Sotter a badly blurred phototastic copy of an article by Earl Zimmerman titled, LASL's Unusual Underground Lab, which described an underground facility built in the late 1940s. This article was undated and of uncertain origin, however Zimmerman can be found labeled as a press bureau member from 1963 to 1965 in a 2020 Los Alamos organizational chart. Dr. Sotter additionally met with a businessman who relayed his experience in visiting Los Alamos in the company of a highly clear associate. The businessman was privy to wherever his esteemed colleague went without question, the individual claimed 75% of Los Alamos's facilities are underground and extend as far as one mile underground. In relation to TUOs and UFOs, so far we have covered very real stiffs under Kirtland slash Sandia and Los Alamos while also discussing the possible existence of facilities existing under Wright Patterson, Fort Hood slash Gray Army airfield Yuma County, China Lake as well as the Nevada test site under the Nevada test and training range. Now onto one of the most critical areas of my research, the Antelope Valley, California. For this section, we will reference the work of both Dr. Sotter as well as the late Bill Hamilton, a tremendous UFO researcher. Hamilton served as a true pioneer of the field, serving as the first researcher to ever produce the term and a public image of ARV, and even handed incredible witnesses such as Mark McCandlish and Bill Uhouse to Stephen Greer. Hamilton's excellent book, Cosmic Top Secret, an ultra rare early 1990s lecture recorded for VHS titled UFOs and Underground Bases, offers us keen insights into Hamilton's research on Dumbs and specific area of interest, the Antelope Valley. In fact, Hamilton produced a map related to him by sources of connected underground UFO facilities in the American Southwest. We will compare this map to existing DoD laboratories and RDT and E locations later on in this video. China Lake Naval Air Station is also quite close to Antelope Valley, so we will discuss that enigmatic facility here as well. Since the late 1980s, Hamilton's work focused on Antelope Valley, California. Many will know this region as one of the chief centers of aerospace technology, housing the infamous USAF Plant 42 Lockheed Skunkworks, the former Norton Air Force Base, the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, major installations for Northrop Grumman, Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas, as well as numerous intriguing radar cross-section facilities in the form of Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas. I have spoken on all of the aforementioned facilities and prior work. Palmdale, California within the Antelope has served as an unrivaled US military slash private contractor classified aircraft production and maintenance location. The region has produced many of the United States most famous advanced aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk, and F-35 Lightning. The Antelope Valley and the City of Palmdale have also served as a critical pillar of my research. Whether this be Norton Air Force Base serving as the location were primary witness Brad S observed the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle, witness Ed disclosing his work for the 412th test group serving as test director for reverse engineered vehicles out of Edwards. Edgar Fouchet, who stated pilots of the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle ARV were plucked from the Edwards 412th Test Pilot School or the alleged project red light out of Edwards which served to act alongside Area 51 to test reverse engineered vehicles very similar to the claims of Ed. Antelope Valley is the most consequential location that has ever come up in all of my research. The late Hamilton was obsessed with the radar cross-section facilities mentioned above. Specifically the Northrop Tehan installation sometimes referred to as the Tehachapi facility or Ant Hill. Due to the rumors of incredible amounts of underground tunnels beneath the installation, in my video on Northrop I investigated this RCS facility in great detail. Thanks to the research of Dr. Sotter we know the Northrop Tehan RCS does indeed have an underground facility. Just as does Hellendale and McDonald Douglas, the question is how big, how deep, and what do they do? Some rumors persist of up to 42 levels with underground tunnels connecting the facility to Edwards and other installations. The concept of a corporate dumb should come as no surprise to anyone. In 1981 the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, yes AT&amp;T, revealed several underground emergency centers. Believe it or not AT&amp;T itself has been historically implicated in non-human technology transfer but that is not our topic for today. These underground centers exist 40 feet below ground and feature three story centers with data banks, dorms, and kitchens. One such location is reported to exist in Catrone County, 180 miles near Sandia National Labs. This is not surprising seen from 1949 to 1993 AT&amp;T in its subsidiary Western Electric ran Sandia National Labs at Kirtland at the order of President Harry S. Truman for the Department of Energy. Indeed as recently as 1970 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey operated an emergency center 300 feet underground near Hudson, New York. This location that more recently held corporate reports featured dining halls and 50 sleeping rooms for key company officials. But back to Tehan and quickly for those who don't know what exactly is a radar cross-section facility. To summarize these facilities utilize high frequency radio waves to test aircraft's radar signatures. This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing radar cross-section. The site features large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast aircraft and materials with radar. Many RCS facilities including the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War. This led the majority of the installation being built underground to hide RCS pylons equipment, models, and technology away from Soviet spy satellites. Numerous researchers over the years have accused the Northrop Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft. The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrance for the Ant Hill Dumb as well as personally been flown over these sites and observed the electromagnetic pulse weapon systems that are used to down craft. Now interestingly the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it. I had known about it since the 90s but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive. So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway. It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out. They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-gravidic anti-grab. The diamond on the left you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get there's not an aerodynamic. They just go boom up but they're placed so different diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these we don't have time to go through and that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict, right? When discussing the RCS facilities and in particular Hamilton's obsession with Tehan, some may remember the XF-131 Super Sentinel. This incredible triangular ARV was drawn by forensic artist Bill McDonald and later featured in season one of the X-Files. According to McDonald, the craft design was relayed to him from two Northrop Tehan and two Lockheed Hellendale engineers who were jaded from the intense secrecy from which they operated. I personally have spoken to McDonald on numerous occasions regarding this triangular ARV out of the Antelope Valley and put much credence into this testimony. For years Hamilton compiled first-hand witness testimony regarding Antelope Valley and specifically the Northrop Tehachapi site. Let's briefly investigate a few of these testimonies. A local man with property on 170th Street, west of Tehan, reported to Hamilton of the ground opening like a missile silo where a flying saucer took off. Edwards Air Force Office of Special Investigation silenced this witness. UFO researcher Dr. Richard Boylan alongside the first-hand source of Bill McDonald have additionally accused Tehan as a manufacturing site for reverse engineered vehicles including the X-F-131 Super Sentinel and anti-gravity disc dubbed by Boylan the Great Pumpkin. A contractor named Chuck relayed his experience digging the underground tunnels beneath the Ant Hill to Hamilton. This source claimed tunnels in the Dumb had round doorways with few doors and red and green lights for ID and entry. An intriguing source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on Project Star Talk at Tehan. This project involved lasers in a big building underground for the purpose of constructing systems to quote-unquote bring in UFOs. The source mentioned scalar technology, a concept Stephen Greer would later on discuss for decades as a weapon source to down UFOs. The Star Talk informer also claimed to work at McDonnell Douglas Stiff where he observed a UFO held in an underground hangar. This name was very hard to make out by a 144p documentary but one Hamilton informer went by the name Gobern who claimed to work at Tehan, Hellendale and the Nevada test and training range. This source relayed to Hamilton he worked with alien technology that deeply frightened him. According to the source on-site personnel would rotate every 14 to 16 days living and working on site and there existed a command center under Haystack Butte which connected to the Ant Hill. Hamilton had numerous other informers who would discuss experimental discs being flown out of Edwards airfield, extraterrestrial discs being held under Edwards and underground UFO work below a hangar on Edwards North Base. Many of these informants would discuss ground vehicles like electric cars within the dumps and maglev train systems connecting the base to others. We will of course discuss this much later on. From his data and sources Hamilton learned of a supposed massive complex of underground facilities in the Antelope Valley engaged with UFO testing storage and material exploitation. All connected via tunnels and transport systems these facilities included Tahachapi, McDonnell Douglas, Hellendale, George Air Force Base Edwards, the NASA rocket test site and China Lake. A network of joint USG and corporate facilities all connected in the Antelope Valley dedicated to the storage and exploitation of UFOs has proven to be quite a common theory since the late 80s and early 1990s work of Hamilton. I'd once again like to reference Stephen Greer witness AH. I have discussed in multiple projects AH a Boeing insider with numerous connections to UFO legacy programs has historically and likely to this day served as a primary source of information for Greer. In his 2000 tape testimony AH delivered to Greer much of the information Greer still discusses to this day including reference to a massive facility existing below Dugway. AH additionally discussed a complex of underground facilities near Anzo California just south of Antelope Valley while also addressing a critical Northrop underground facility named of course Tehan. Did you share with you any other information on other facilities that dealt with this issue in US or abroad? Yes he mentioned there's a base here in California near Anzo California and there's another base in the deserts of I believe he said Tacone or Tejon. I believe he said Tejon. I believe that's the word that he used there's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area and near this is very funny it's near Northrop there's an underground area out there too that he was aware of and but he particularly mentioned and stayed focused on Anzo California there's some underground areas up there too that they're researching some of this technology and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light. Of this network of proposed facilities one possible dumb stands out from the rest Edwards Air Force Base. As mentioned in nearly every project Edward serves as home to the 412th test group a major range and test facility base. Witness Ed a vetted and accomplished USAT veteran claimed Edwards and the Nevada test and training range specifically Nellis Air Force Base in Area 51 slash Groom Lake which is actually run by an Edwards 412th detachment runs a joint UFO reverse engineering program. Outside of the claims of Hamilton's informants regarding Edwards and craft stored in underground installations there are many fascinating testimonies and avenues of research we might pursue. Remember how one source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on the Ant Hill installation under Tejon in Antelope Valley. The source claimed the installation's command center existed under Edwards Haystack Butte. This sentiment is shared by the controversial and enigmatic whistleblower Dr. Michael Wolfe who claimed as a UAP consultant to the National Security Council he heard live extraterrestrials were kept under Haystack Butte Edwards. Test facilities are built into an on Haystack Butte east of Edwards indeed these facilities are run alongside a primary field lab at the remote northeast corner of Edwards by the Air Force Research Lab's Aerospace Systems Directorate. AFRL Edwards 412th Test Wing and NASA Flight Research Facility work together at Edwards to plan conduct analyze and report on all flight and ground testing of aircraft weapon systems software and components as well as modeling and simulation for the USAF. Since facilities are built into the Butte it is no stretch to assume locations are built under the Haystack Butte and remember this USAF AFRL rocket propulsion division and their rocket test labs on Lumen Ridge were named by Hamilton and his informants as featuring a stiff location connected to the wider Edwards underground complex. This lab features a number of underground missile silos but the extent to which the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory underground is unknown however and very interesting numerous studies out of the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab have shown a heavy interest in anti-gravity propulsion is this location definitely UFO legacy related unknown but a strong argument can be made from witness testimony and lastly a bit north to Antelope is China Lake Naval Air Weapon Station as we showed in a 1964 Army Corps of Engineers study titled Feasibility of Constructing Large Underground Cavities Inyo County which shares territory with China Lake was considered for underground purposes the underground cavity of interest was 4,000 feet deep and it is unknown if this facility was built however numerous witness testimony may give us some idea as we also discussed above Dr. Sotter had been given testimony by Navy Veterans stationed at China Lake who not only claimed the facility goes one mile deep but weapons work is conducted on quote weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons end quote Hamilton himself also had a source who allegedly served as an aerospace engineer consultant to NASA and Colonel this unnamed Colonel claimed he worked at an underground installation at China Lake Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada test site these locations were according to the source connected via a maglev train system from which he would often enter through a dump beneath White Sands missile range I put stock in this testimony due to speaking myself to a witness who claimed to travel via underground train system from a fort in Texas to White Sands this source an army officer in the 2010s claimed the train speed and acceleration were so great it reminded him of his fear of flying we also have Ed and the mention of Edwards and the NTTR China Lake is not mentioned in his testimony however it stands to reason the very near China Lake which serves as the Navy's largest single land holding representing 85% of the Navy's weapons and armaments are DT&amp;E programs could likely see crossover TUO programs with the USAF if these programs exchange nonhuman craft materials and research it stands to reason such transactions would be conducted underground to maintain secrecy I would in the future like to do an entire video on China Lake so hang tight corporate and military installations do indeed exist below Antelope Valley again the question is do these sites deal with technologies of unknown origin and exploitation programs Antelope and Palmdale are home to aerospace juggernauts and myriad DOD RDT&amp;E and MRTFBs and have for decades featured numerous testimonies of ARV underground installations and claims of UFO legacy programs due to these factors plus witnesses who have told me they have traveled below the Antelope Valley I am inclined to conclude such an anthill if so to speak does in fact exist to work on UFO legacy programs the vast majority of our focus today is the American Southwest and endless claims of underground UFO research in RDT&amp;E but quickly I do want to look east we have already discussed STIFs used by the CIA and NSA under cover of the Army and Navy respectively but what about UFO STIFs for this reason I would like to look to the United States Capitol and address the deep underground command center the DUCC was a stiff below the Pentagon that was never built however I am not sure just how true that statement is now an acknowledged stiff under the Pentagon does indeed exist the national military command center responsible for generating emergency action messages to missile control launch centers nuclear subs and battlefield commanders this NMCC was set to serve as an interim facility for the never built DUCC the deep underground command center was first proposed in 1963 three weeks before the assassination of JFK declassified top secret documents dated 7 november 63 detail former secretary of defense Robert McNamara proposing meetings to discuss the national underground command center these plans for the national or deep underground command center detailed a complex command center built 3,500 feet below Washington DC this location would be built to withstand direct hits of 200 to 300 megaton warheads that penetrate 70 to 100 feet below the surface before detonation two separate facilities were proposed an austere facility with 10,000 total square feet and 5,000 operating square feet accommodating 40 people at a depth of 3,500 feet this would cost over 110 million dollars or 1.1 billion today the second was a moderate sized facility with 100,000 total square feet and 50,000 operating square feet accommodating 300 people at a depth of 3,500 feet this would cost 310 million or over 3.2 billion dollars today the joint chiefs interestingly proposed the austere facility to be too small the operation capsule of the center would be near the pentagon and an access elevator would descend 3,500 feet underground from the pentagon installation this may seem like a massive undertaking however the memorandum stated quote there is little argument that the construction of a du cc is technically feasible end quote to quote the memo again quote the nature of the du cc regardless of the initial size selected lends itself to later expansion end quote once linden b johnson took office a second memorandum was issued 16 january 1964 from wall rosto to mcgeorge bundy stating the du cc concept should proceed rosto served as a senior advisor to both kennedy and johnson an additional memo followed the same day from mcgeorge bundy to carl kason showing planning for the du cc had been going forward since the early days of the johnson admin kason was deputy special assistant for national security affairs to kennedy and possibly stayed on to advise on the du cc program the memo additionally stated kason having spoken to herald brown read the du cc brown served as director of defense research and engineering from 1961 to 1965 a last top secret memo dealing with the du cc was issued by the bureau of the budget estimated between 1963 to 1964 40 plus percent of this document is redacted was the du cc ever built conventional sources would say no however i would argue indeed it was this confidence of mine is from sources who have described to me firsthand encounters within an enormous cavernous facility below the pentagon but how does such a proposed facility deal with the subject of ufo's if the du cc was indeed built it is a publicly denied site therefore we can feasibly reckon if the site does exist it deals with subjects critical to us national security since the 1954 atomic energy agreement materials pertaining to ufo's have been misclassified as trans classified foreign nuclear materials as relayed by physicists robert sarbacher in 1950 ufo programs exist and their classification resides even higher than that of the h-bomb on this channel i've spoken in-depth at ufo legacy program operations are the ultimate secret deep-six clandestine set of programs deeply embedded within special access programs the pentagon resides near crystal city crystal city features eight of ten of the us's top defense contractors in the small neighborhood is where two-thirds of federal contracts are awarded by this location holds primary offices held by northrop grumman, lockheed martin, boeing, wrathion, general dynamics, l3, aerojet, rockadine, and more all contractors i highly suspect engage with ufo programs the neighborhood also holds or is in close proximity to numerous ffr dcs i believe are up to their eyeballs in ufo programs these include the center for naval analyses institute for defense analysis aerospace corporation and rand homeland security operations analysis center additionally crystal city is home to myriad do d research agencies including darpa office of naval research and air force office of scientific research i do believe similar to the antelope valley crystal city's amalgamation of do d entities ffr dcs and contractors is a major center of operations for ufo legacy programs perhaps due to limited airspace and usage of mrt fbs unlike the american desert in southwest crystal city is where the majority of ufo related usaps are created maintained and kept secure this is a thesis i will continue to explore in depth in the future if crystal city does indeed majorly engage with clandestine ufo unacknowledged special access programs it stands to reason such a classified effort involving do d private and semi-private entities would require a massive underground facility the idea of a major network of underground tunnels connecting dumps nationwide is often scoffed at i have no idea if the entire nation's stiffs are connected via tunnel system but a strong argument can be made complex systems of interconnecting stiffs exist in the american southwest and east coast after all in a document obtained via foya by dr richard solder we even have hard numbers from the military industrial complex of the estimated number of total personnel needed to build and operate a deeply buried hundreds of mile long tunnel system and this is the order of 7800 to 8700 people and we also have a hard estimate for the total expenses associated with constructing operating and maintaining such a system the neighborhood of 17 billion dollars over a 10-year period many such acknowledged tunnel systems exist like the department of energy sprawling tunnel network below the nevada test and training range but let's continue to explore the feasibility of massive tunnel systems connecting bases dozens or hundreds of miles apart the technology for such undertakings does indeed exist the most likely candidates are nuclear subterranes and tunnel boring machines tunnel boring machines are huge cylindrical mechanical boring machines that tunnel through rock and soil chewing out circular tunnels that may range in diameter of up to 35 or more feet these goliaths are powered by electrical motors that have a cutting head equipped with various metal attachments made of super hard alloys that cut through rock as the head rotates the head rotates and the cutting tools dig into the rock ripping and gouging it away the excavated rock or muck is then passed by a conveyor assembly to the rear of the machine where it can be hauled away by truck or train according to the pacific gas and electric company utilizing a robin's company tbm to bore a 22 000 foot long 24 foot diameter tunnel it took a rate of five to six miles per year however in better conditions some tbms could bore at a rate of 10 miles per year or greater roughly double the rate of the pacific gas and electric company this would mean dumbs below china lake and edwards could be connected in as little as five and a half years nuclear subterranes were originally designed by low salamos national lab sound familiar the patents for such machines were filed technical documents were written but the project seemingly faded into obscurity these fascinating machines work by melting through rock and soil leaving neat solidly glass lined tunnels by vitrifying materials heat is supplied to the system via compact nuclear reactors that circulate liquid lithium from the reactor core to the tunnel face melting rock in front of the machine cooled liquid lithium then circulates to the back of the machine alongside the exterior of the machine to cool surrounding rock as the machine is forced forward patents were first proposed by the atomic energy commission in us energy rnd in 1972 and 1975 further nuclear subterranean patents in 1975 detailed tunnel systems of 12 meters or more in diameter all but one of the inventors listed in the three patents above were from low salamos additionally at 1973 low salamos study titled systems and cost analysis for a nuclear subterranean tunnel machine a preliminary study concluded nuclear subterranes to be a cost efficient solution to satisfy us transportation tunnel demands similar to how we deduce numerous dumps were built around 1961 to 1989 we can make similar deductions regarding connective tunnel systems if such an enormous tunnel system exists it likely saw construction beginning around the early 1970s 1974 to be exact the bechtel corporation is an american engineering procurement and construction management company founded in the u.s bechtel has often been targeted as one of the u.s corporations responsible for dumb tunnel systems in 1974 bechtel released a report titled research program plan for meeting tomorrow's needs in tunneling and excavation final report this report states quote the demand for tunneling and underground excavation for national defense needs is believed to be large some examples of underground defense facilities include hard rock silos command posts communication systems personnel shelters storage and power generation facilities end quote interestingly enough the same report shows a massive list of novel ground disintegration techniques in r&amp;d stages in 1972 the governing board of the national research council formed the u.s national committee on tunneling technology this committee functioned as the quote united states focal agency in the field of tunneling technology to assess and stimulate improvements in tunneling technology applications and to coordinate us tunneling technology activities with those of other nations end quote by 1977 this us n t t had six major subcommittees including the deep cavity and tunnel support systems committees us n c t t partnered with numerous corporations agencies and academics of particular interest to this channel these include both sandia national labs and bechtel memorial institute i've accused bechtel of engaging deeply with uap legacy programs including operations at the dugway alleged dumb in 1981 in 1982 the us n c t t sponsored a project called workshop on technology for the design and construction of deep underground defense facilities this was done at the behest of the nuclear defense agency and co-sponsors included the bureau of reclamation army usaf navy do e and national science foundation including others the 1982 report of the workshop detailed the need for 400 miles of tunnels ranging from 2500 to 3500 feet for various purposes including housing nuclear missiles these tunnels were to be up to 16 feet in diameter with quote interconnecting passageways and add its horizontal passageways for storage living quarters and other needs end quote the location of such a network of tunnels according to the new york times would be quote probably in the desert of the western united states such tunnels and installations were to be powered via fuel cells or nuclear reactors and as we saw in 1963 the us army corps of engineers was very serious about nuclear reactors powering self-contained underground installations fuel cells may also be of special interest here seen as in 1984 bowing published the results of a study that set forth plans for power generation in deep icb m bases using iron chlorine fuel cells to generate power the usn ctt called for mobilization of this plan in the late 80s and early 90s the committee called for tunnel boring machines to be utilized starting in 1985 for carving tunnel systems by 1988 usn ctt was publishing reports titled tunneling and underground space technology discussing underground missile systems ranging between 3000 to 8000 feet underground during this period in the 80s numerous contractors i have directly accused of being involved in ufo legacy programs would aid in the construction of deep underground missile bases and tunnel systems of course we must assume some if not many underground nuclear missile bases may have served as clandestine rd tne facilities this should not come as a shock as we have already discussed us intelligence agencies utilizing underground military sites for secret operations such corporations include bdm who was awarded in 1985 a contract to conduct quote intercontinental ballistic missile deep basing communication study end quote as well as trw who had since 1968 been involved in studies into high speed ground transportation tunnel design and cost analysis both corporations were later on bought by northrop grumman the 1985 bdm study is of particular interest here remember if you will earlier that same year 20 to 25 may 1985 to be exact bdm mclean also held the advanced theoretical physics conference the meetings of this exclusive group were classified utilizing doe controls notes of this conference were released by attendee oki shannon who formally served as manager for special projects at low salamos national labs this mclean virginia secure facility group discussed myriad aspects of ufo's including legacy programs and a major engineering project under bobby ray inman viewers of my channel will absolutely recall inman mentioned often as a senior ufo legacy operations member at this time the vice president of bdm was former major general and founder of us army inscom albert stubblebine stubblebine will be mentioned again in this project including how he was accused of engaging in ufo craft storage and material exploitation while head of army intelligence at fort hachuka arizona interestingly the advanced theoretical working group was spearheaded by us army colonel john b alexander who from 1982 to 1983 reported directly to stubblebine additionally recall how philip j corso claimed a ufo working group was established in the mid 80s according to corso this group saw ample funding from us army inscom general stubblebine it is interesting to think of possible ties between this icbm deep basing communication study and albert stubblebine and the advanced theoretical physics conference and a possible ufo working group accused by philip j corso throughout the 1980s us industry and government additionally demonstrated a keen interest in life support systems for massive tunnel systems underground icbm installations as well as deep and i mean deep underground bases this can be demonstrated in a november 1985 contract to uni tech technologies hamilton standard division for life support and chemical biological agent mitigation system on small icbm deep basing programs end quote us army corps of engineers as well as us nctt have even discussed provable technologies times and prices to construct such massive tunnel systems yet no data exists on any large-scale tunneling project this may force us to look deeper like at the low-profile records of the bureau of reclamation who during the 20th century excavated hundreds of miles of tunnels up to 28 and a half feet in diameter at depths of hundreds to thousands of feet quite often the bureau would utilize classic tunnel boring machines numerous inside sources to dr richard solder have informed him that some of the bureau of reclamation's tunnels have doubled as cover for other clandestine underground tunnels to quote underground and underwater bases quote from a hypothetical point of view what is to stop a tunnel boring machine from tunneling off of an aqueduct tunnel deep underground and striking out secretly to make a clandestine tunnel it takes about 10 men to operate a tbm and in good rock you can count on as much as 15 miles of tunnel per year end quote for decades rumors of underground railroad systems specifically maglev trains have been inseparable from testimony regarding dums and ufo's as we discussed earlier in the antelope valley section such a concept was related to ufo researcher bill hamilton by some of his many informants but just how true are these rumors of a high-speed electromagnetic railroad system often described as a pneumatic system aka a train system operating in a partial vacuum tube to begin what is maglev maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetic rather than employing wheels maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad systems including higher speeds superior acceleration and deceleration lower maintenance costs improved gradient handling and lower noise but are much more expensive compared to traditional systems maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour and pneumatic tube trains are an early form of transportation or air vacuum to move containers or vehicles through tubes while minimizing friction new york's first subway system was an underground pneumatic tube transport line created by alfred elie beach earlier in this project we spoke of nazi scientists being sequestered by air material command in the us to work on underground complexes i would also like to draw attention to herman kemper kemper was a third rike engineer who created a concept for the roarbon the roarbon was a system of magnetic levitation trains designed to speed through underground vacuum tunnels at hundreds or even thousands of miles per hour suspended passenger cars on magnetic fields would be propelled through tunnels negating any friction of wheels rails and air kemper's research began in 1934 by 1938 he envisioned berlin connected to other european cities with cars traveling at 600 to 1000 miles per hour it is unknown how far the nazis pursued this concept nor is it known if kemper was recruited by operation paperclip a feasible hypothesis here is kemper was contracted by the us to help build early iterations of maglev pneumatic systems maglev ufo's and dumbs are often lumped together as conspiracy however maglevs are not a niche concept since the 1960s maglev technology has seen numerous patents and by the year 2000 even lockheed martin entered into agreements with trans rapid international usa to develop maglev technology in the us in fact by the early 1990s an acknowledged multi agency national maglev institute was formed this joint effort by the doe and us army corps of engineers sought to quote define the role maglev could play in us transportation system to assess the potential for maglev in the domestic market to recommend a strategy for the introduction of maglev technology and to identify the most appropriate federal role end quote this nmi published a report in the early nineties titled compendium of executive summaries from the maglev system concept definition final reports this series of reports sought to determine nationwide maglev system availability by the year 2000 some interesting players appear in this document this includes a joint project with bechtel hughes aircraft and mit which employs a uark for the army a second report saw work by bowing aerospace and general dynamics to study superconducting levitation to top this off a third study saw joint efforts into superconducting magnets performed by grumman corporation pre northrop betel memorial labs and honeywell all contractors mentioned above in above board maglev technology research i highly spect have for decades attempted the reverse engineering and material exploitation of non-human craft however rumors of clandestine maglev systems far precede the 1990s and 2000s dr richard solder as well as bill hamilton first heard whispers of such systems in the 1980s solder himself referenced reading reports of underground rail systems to area 51 from mercury nevada and the naval surface warfare center corona division discussion of these rail systems would even pop up in online ufo forums around 1997 look at the name on the top of these testimony reports a j kradoc in disgust in the dugway project kradoc is an oil tycoon operating in libya that helped steven greer in the 1990s with c setty kradoc brought greer in my opinion incredibly valuable and relevant information regarding area 51 moving many ufo operations to dugway so if maglev systems existed far before ufo legacy program defense contractors engaged with the acknowledged national maglev institute where and when might these systems have been developed and of what technology the mid 1960s saw established engineering professors from the office of naval research army research office and booze allen hamilton established the international society for terrain vehicle systems or istv real quick in the mid to late 20th century i believe booze allen hamilton was as involved in ufo legacy operations as northrop grumman is today but that's another project for another day the istv s working group coordinated research around high speed underground tube train systems at the same time of the istv s the u.s department of commerce established a multi agency panel focused on high speed underground tube train systems the panel produced a 1967 report titled rnd for high speed ground transportation which states quote regardless of the system adopted it can be assumed that extensive tunneling will be involved it is recommended that the department cooperate closely with other agencies in planning and funding research into this area to provide an extra stimulus for rapid development end quote of massive consequence to this investigation in 1972 robert salter of the rand corporation published a study titled the very high speed transit system in this study ran set out a continental deep underground concept that was described as quote electromagnetically levitated and propelled cars in an evacuated tunnel end quote the study makes some truly shocking statements including quote speeds as high as 14 thousand miles per hour have been examined and studies by the rand corporation in an example case of a direct link between los angeles and new york requiring only 21 minutes of transit time the speeds required will certainly be on the order of thousands of miles per hour on long haul links end quote i believe salter additionally makes a critical statement that lends strongly towards the subject of ufo legacy dumps salter states quote because of the rather considerable expanse of the tunnel it is probable that the first vhst will not rely on a direct nonstop la and white link but rather one that stops at two intermediate staging points end quote these intermediate staging points are apparent when throughout this video i have made and will continue to make in the hamilton map segment the argument that ufo dump networks feature central hubs these hubs if so to speak are connected to one another and branch to local smaller dump facilities think of a railway central station connecting to other major stations while also featuring alternative lines to small local stops much of this technology was based on work conducted by robert goddard father of modern rocketry's 1945 vacuum tube transport system as well as michael minovich the physicists behind introducing gravity assisted propulsion around planetary bodies 1961 work deep underground tube shuttle salter and ran strongly recommended placing the vhst underground to remove interference with environmental factors such as grade crossings weather and infrastructure and also observed that it was not appreciable harder to tunnel at great lengths underground than at shallow depths within this study is a map of the proposed vhst that corresponds strongly to build hamilton's alleged western state dump network but more on this later around a similar time frame to this ran study is the high speed ground transportation initiative this group became operational in the 1960s performing most of their work in the 1970s before slipping out of public view in the 1980s for a period of 10 to 15 years the united states saw enormous efforts into rnd and feasibility and desirability of high speed underground tube shuttle train systems entities involved in this program are countless including trw general dynamics mit southwest research institute behind project stargate general electric nasa army navy and batel memorial institute i have mentioned some of the work published under this initiative before including trw's 1967 study titled abstracts of concepts of high speed ground transportation systems remember trw was purchased by northrop grumman and long considered as the contractor behind the majestic 12 like entity project zodiac for the high speed ground transportation initiative trw additionally prepared a study titled state of the art tube vehicle system in 1970 this study discussed tube systems and tunnels as deep as 3000 feet underground using trains that would travel at speeds of 450 miles per hour similar to the dumb tunnel concept no admission of maglevs connecting stiffs is publicly available however there is an overwhelming body of historical evidence the us and defense contractors have had a keen interest in high speed underground transit systems traveling at least as fast as a commercial airliner to close off our investigation i would like to return to 1992's cosmic top secret by bill hamilton in this masterpiece of a book hamilton provides a map of underground facilities and tunnels provided to him by one tal in 1990 some data here is from thomas c aka thomas castillo which is an extremely controversial source with the dulce new mexico story so instead let's go ahead and analyze the map this network spans the american west and southwest with major installations listed in southern california new mexico and colorado as expected earlier we find edwards air force based connected to myriad locations including numerous small marks labeled rnd we also see a supposed underground base marked cat this is of course catalina island fascinating how in 2023 and 2024 discussion began to swirl of an underground extraterrestrial or human base off of catalina island we also see area 51 as a major reference with connections to tonipa an installation infamous in ufo lore as well we also find interesting solo mark dumps not connected in this alleged system including fort hutchuka arizona a location i estimate is involved heavily in ufo programs remember if you will fort hutchuka holds a defense agency major range and test facility base a critical core facility called the joint interoperability center army intelligence at fort hutchuka was previously run by us army inscom founder major general albert stubblebine stubblebine and inscom have been accused by myself in numerous projects amongst others as engaging in ufo crash retrieval storage and material exploitation therefore it is really no surprise to see hamilton's map designate fort hutchuka as a dumb location on the map are many locations in new mexico including the controversial dulci los alamos and sandia slash curtland the latter two we know have underground facilities indeed the same extents to shayan in colorado intriguing to note here is an installation in chihuahua mexico this subject wouldn't be touched jake barbers romana clay called sentinels of ether this project describes a 2004 blue on blue ufo retrieval team fire operation in which the clandestine team flew into a disguised base hidden in the mountains of chihuahua what happens when we start to compare this map to others see now a comparison between hamilton's dumb network and rand's vhst see the interesting direct route shared across the two maps through the northern area of arizona and new mexico additionally observe how southern california sees routes split to both southern california near san diego and northern california near sacramento before continuing north to portland in washington also notice connections to denver on both locations outside of shayan mountain complex denver colorado is home to an enormous underground fema complex this is likely a continuity of government or c o g complex my true interest lies in comparing the hamilton piece to defense laboratories and centers across the united states here we will not find groom lake amongst other select facilities but i believe this comparison is of critical importance if you will please forgive the maps not lining up the 1990 map is scaled differently than the 2019 do d map so the two are not merged to scale perfectly aligning the two maps brings extreme interest to both dumb locations as well as markings on the hamilton piece that are labeled rnd since this map pertains to connected underground ufo installations we can assume by the maps legend these locations do not employ dumps but are still focused on ufo legacy rnd as expected southern california brings a massive amount of locations of interest even outside of the antelope valley to the southwest in los angeles lies a tremendous amount of do d rd t ne labs ffr dcs like rand and aerospace corporations and uarks like the usc institute for creative technologies numerous other locations outside of the antelope line up between the two maps we have discussed throughout this investigation including fort hachuka shyan mountain colorado dugway and its two mrtfb's low salamos white sands missile range sandia and curtland air force base from referencing do d labs we can also learn curtland and its proven underground facilities stand out even more curtland additionally holds the air force research labs space vehicles directorate and directed energy directorate of note shared on these maps albeit slightly shifted is the fourth defense estate microelectronics activity in northern california in do d terms fourth estate describes non-military parts of the do d these include the defense contract audit agency defense contract management agency and the defense finance and accounting service fourth estate agencies and field activities all watching this video might recognize our darpa and the defense missile agency prior to this investigation i had never come across mention of a dumb below the d m e a so this is a terrific point of research moving forward let's also reference more of the non-connected rnd locations on hamilton's map that exist as acknowledged do d rd t ne facilities in nebraska on both maps we find identification of the us stratcom university affiliated research center the university of nebraska national strategic research institute viewers of my work know uarcs and ffr dcs are cornerstones of uap legacy program so it is interesting to see hamilton identify a uarc as a ufo rnd location all the way back in 1992 that would not be founded until 2012 in oklahoma we observe fort sill as ufo rnd and the naval surface warfare center indian head special weapons division mccallister detachment as ufo storage i have come across both of these locations in my research however it is interesting to see an nswc location labeled as storage especially after the testimony of randy anderson and the off-world technologies division at the naval surface warfare centered crane in northern kansas we observe overlap of a ufo research facility this facility is the us army leavenworth research unit in texas we find fort hood army research unit as a ufo research location however it is interesting to see this facility is not marked as a stiff especially after numerous testimony relayed by and research done by lennard stringfield the hamilton map deserves an entire investigation of its own and possibly i will do so with dr sotter because after all this map does accuse dumbs of existing at all locations we have previously discussed as well as many that warrant further investigation including fort stockton fort urwin vandenberg a fb chocolate mountains aerial gunnery range 29 palms hutchinson air force station and peterson air force base as well as the cities of kingsley nebraska tulsa oklahoma and riverton wyoming i have spoken to dr sotter and he has spoken directly with bill hamilton regarding this map so just maybe he can aid in further dissecting of these locations hey guys it's gerb and if you're still with me thank you so much for joining me in this at this point hour 20 hour and a half investigation into dumbs as many of you know and as many people have been looking forward to this project dumbs are a passion project of mine i speak about installations under dugway under the antelope valley under the north of tejon and hellendale facilities in numerous videos uh i think probably my last four videos straight i've mentioned one if not multiple of these locations as we made it to the end of this video i'd like to thank again dr richard sotter for all of his excellent research now this video is going to be doing things a little bit differently of course in every single one of my videos i include my show notes in the video description or a link please bear with me a couple days here as i have not only compiled my research links for this video but also every single document that i can find that dr richard sotter has included in his three books so every single defense technical document every single army corps of engineer document every single document i could find which there's hundreds so please allow me a couple days to compile all that and deliver that because i think it's excellent to read through all of those and please read through dr richard sotter's books they're they're excellent as we know from today the subject of dumbs is very vast it's almost impossible to know where and when to start there is a tremendous amount of literature on deep underground facilities for continuity of government use for icbm silos for just general underground installations accessible by vertical or inclined shaft there's also a tremendous amount of information specifically starting post 1974 with bechtel on large-scale tunneling systems and conventional and unconventional the blasting methods this would be a tunnel boring machine or a nuclear subterranean as a conventional method or explosives or possibly nuclear detonation as unconventional and also a lot of literature on maglev technology i know these three subjects of interconnected dumb bases are often scoffed at without a lot of research but this is a very serious subject and at least i would say focused in the southwest and the american desert and the east there are probably large networks of dumps this would include new mexico arizona southern california possibly up to connecting to dugway and colorado and then a network out east including the warrenton army training facility camp piery camp david uh the du cc which i wager highly exists and so forth now of course let's treat this video as a part one a part two will be a project with dr richard solder i spoke to him the other week for about two to three hours and he graciously agreed to come on the show and talk more about dumps i think what's really interesting here is there are numerous informants just like bill hamilton had that have told him about installations and facilities and perhaps he can tell those on our project together and relay them because he said some to me in our conversations that he hasn't repeated publicly that are indeed quite interesting also when bill hamilton was still alive dr richard solder talked to him and length about his network of dumps maps so possibly for an hour hour and a half we will dive into that so please look forward to a dr richard solder project coming in the future and please also look forward to the show notes you know uh another thing i'm doing is i'm planning to build a website no sign up needed it's not the dpi archive but i'm planning to uh put up a website where i have videos transcripts of the videos and all research links so i'd like to put those there the only reason i plan to do this is to make it easier to access all the materials i put forth with my research but i want to know what everybody thinks about dumps specifically networks of dumps dumps are not a controversial things dumps do indeed exist and from numerous testimony whether that be lennard stringfield whether that be testimony to solder to hamilton to myself there is a incredible argument that many of these facilities dump facilities engage in uap legacy programs i like to think back to the testimony of ms for example which led to a tremendously fruitful venture into the dump under dugway and of course we even have a specific entrance to that facility other research from other informants can be done on this another thing i did differently in this project of course is i hardly interject when witnesses have spoken to me about testimony or given me testimony i thought it prudent in this investigation just when speaking about various stump facilities and to summarize these include i've spoken to individuals who have been in networks under the antelope valley in location under texas that connected via underground train that went so fast it reminded this army veteran of his fear of flying to white sands missile range as well as the what we might call the deep underground command center out east this is a location deep under the pentagon how deep i don't know however i have good insight this is a facility or at least there are facilities here that are run by the cia directorate of science and technology if that sounds familiar to you that was the cia office that blocked the material transfer in 2008 from lockheed martin to the osap program and that was the 1953 kingman crash but the networks of dumps are what are so interesting to me for example harkening back to the story of ed and the nevada test and training range and edwards air force base there's other testimony about connections in bases in southern california to to area 51 tone upon the nevada test and training range if i could ever get ed to sit down in a room and believe me i've tried to speak to him the first thing i would ask him if there's connective tunneling systems and what type of vehicles if there are that connect these two places now absent in this video of course i talked about in the beginning are the stories of bob lasar the stories of dulcy base and thomas castillo and the story of phil schneider i believe that these in that these witnesses these subjects are very controversial so i didn't include them because of their controversy but because when i have such controversial claims i think it prudent to investigate those and vet those and try to determine any sort of objective information from those when we can so you know s4 for example i do believe s4 is a facility that does indeed exist does it have extraterrestrial or non-human technology i don't know uh an individual i've spoken to that went to s4 talked about colored lines where to walk but he didn't see anything that would say non-human technology but then again he was not privy to the entire base but because of that i would like to focus on subjects like s4 maybe dulcy base um and maybe other locations as well and i will do those in a separate project with this project i wanted to take as objective of an approach as i could i wanted to combine the facts we know about dums about tunnel systems about maglev systems and relay those two stories of the ansolope valley stories of locations out east i mean there is a tremendous amount of facilities i didn't get to cover here that i would like to revisit so again as i spoke about in the project with dr richard solder this is just kind of a taste into dums i do think this is one of the most consequential subjects of of ufo legacy programs you know like i said and i'll say it again most underground facilities as we see from the u.s army corps of engineers and other documents were first proposed as a continuity of government a cog or a icbm silo facility and we know that is partially true in the large fema underground center near denver colorado which everybody knows i'm from colorado so that's near where i am so the clandestine operation when did these start as we talked about the dums there's a good argument that in post 1961 when the u.s army corps of engineers really started to look into underground facilities uh massive ones ranging up to up to in some documents 8 000 feet underground into the late 90s i think this is when the vast majority of underground installations were built when were the connective tunnels built if these do exist which i believe many locations do feature connective tunnels this of course as we saw in the bechtel report with conventional and unconventional tunneling methods probably started around 1974 between 1972 and 1974 a whole host of tunneling committees and institutes were set up to investigate massive tunneling systems and of course following in the 80s into the 90s we see the same thing with maglev technologies so i i think the order of operations here is likely the dumbest built maybe a decade later connective tunnels are built and maybe a decade after that the full train systems are implemented i mean in the 90s we see the national maglev institute and we see corporations like grumman like general dynamics like betel doing aboveboard maglev research so this could likely imply they had been doing clandestine research into similar projects into electromagnetics long before then so it's a it's an incredibly fascinating subject especially when you start to look at the bureau of reclamation and what dr solder has relayed from his informants about the bureau of reclamation this was possibly an aboveboard tunneling system in the american southwest that featured clandestine secondary tunnels to bore out whatever was needed and as we saw in the list i scrolled through there are hundreds of tunnels from the bor that in the mid to late 20th century and some of these are hundreds of miles long some of these are thousands and they range in depths from just underground to up to near a thousand feet so when dr solders informant relates to him that 10 men can operate a tbm and a good tbm in good conditions can chew through up to 10 miles per year i do think this is a likely candidate you know this harkens back to other ufo legacy program funding operations how we what we get can make educated guesses via irad sole source contracts id iq and utilizing legitimate contracts to skim off funds for ufo legacy programs now again i want to know what everybody thinks if there are people here who have been to underground facilities massive deep underground facilities please reach out to me i would love to hear about your experience i will respect your anonymity but if you have a location a facility to describe or an experience in such a facility please reach out to me i would love to talk to you but again guys let me know in the comments what you think this has been a long spiel almost 11 minutes i think i've rambled quite a bit please remember to like and subscribe

It was everywhere, all down everywhere when we went down there because there was plants and everything. It was, it was weird. It was a purplish green color and you could tell it was like, it was just weird. It was, it's hard to explain it kind of like, like, like it was like it seemed to just like be alive. I mean, it was almost like, if you're looking like something organic, I don't know, I couldn't tell. It didn't look like anything we would make, like machine parts or anything. It looked like it was sculpted. These were these large vents. They looked like they went into the craft, but I couldn't tell. But it, I mean, it was a shadow. That was the only thing that really cast a shadow. The rest of this, well, it was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow where you could see where there wasn't light. But the sun was shining right on the object and it didn't cast a shadow. Not on anything. It was like kind of like absorbing the light. It was weird, strange. There was no reflection or anything like that, you know. Is there anything positive at all that you've got now? Yeah, I'm still alive. Yeah, they threw me into the mud and all that liquid got my hair in my face. Oh, they were like scientists, I suppose. They had this typo, like we'd call it mop gear, right? Mission-oriented protective posture. And they had gas masks on and like rubber suits and they were coming around. And you had all kinds of weird people there. Some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on and personal protective gear. And it was all different ones, different kinds. Very few first-hand UFO witness encounters over the decades have matched the intrigue, coherence, and respect as former US Marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan. Lance Corporal Wagan first told of his harrowing UFO crash retrieval encounter during official service in US Operation Laser Strike in the Peruvian jungle through Stephen Greer in the year 2000. As a young perimeter security marine tasked to investigate a downed aircraft thought to be a South American drug smuggling plane or friendly US vehicle, the Lance Corporal claimed to have stumbled upon a crashed, egg-shaped UFO and subsequent Department of Energy retrieval team that in my opinion gives us one of the greatest possible instances of insight into how US government rapid reaction UFO recovery teams operate. Since his original testimony, Wagan has publicly discussed his encounter with a non-human craft, an antagonistic DOE retrieval team only once more. In 2023, Jonathan Wagan appeared on a podcast with Martin Willis, re-addressing aspects of the Lance Corporal's incredible encounter but exploring little new ground. Today, I am beyond excited to announce a true successor to Jonathan Wagan's 2000 testimony, an in-person discussion where Jonathan and myself discuss why he went public, new details of the UFO crash retrieval encounter, adverse health effects and reprisals Jonathan has faced and so much more. Before this discussion, I thought it pertinent to take a step back and cover Wagan's testimony in painstaking details. After all, I have covered this case before in one of my first ever projects but barely even scratched the surface of this encounter. So before I sit down with Wagan in the coming weeks, let's take a step back and analyze every single detail of this 1997 encounter, from piecing together the origins and deployment of the DOE recovery team to contacting other Marines allegedly involved with the case, to determining where Wagan may have been taken and interrogated to analyzing specific similar egg-shaped UFO crash retrievals. Let us leave no stone unturned analyzing one of the most fascinating first-hand UFO crash retrieval cases in history. Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we embark on a comprehensive analysis of the claims of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan. As a precursor to my in-person interview with Jonathan, I thought it pertinent to step back and critically analyze the entirety of his testimony. This investigation will not seek to simply retell this incredible UFO crash case but to unravel this case and gain insights into US UFO crash retrieval teams. And before we get started a few things to point out, I would like to thank RGHUFOs and take OM for their incredible 2023 work into Wagan's case. These excellent researchers arrived at many of the same conclusions I did long before this project so please check out their work in the video description. I'll also be pulling clips from Wagan's 2023 podcast with Martin Willis and 2000 tape testimony with Steven Greer. And it is worthy to note, Greer chopped up Wagan's original testimony, emitting certain details. These include Wagan describing what looked to be a four-fingered arm hanging out of a recessed hall in the crashed UFO. Greer seemingly omitted this from the 2000 testimony. Due to this, I will be pulling Wagan's recorded tapes off of Steven Greer's DPI archive to try and capture Wagan's words uncut and in their purest form. But these files are still chopped up and edited. I have found it impossible to get my hands on the full unedited tape but this is the closest we can get. Due to these rough files, audio quality is significantly worse than the published interview but I still find it important to publish Wagan's words without edits. These source files contain many additional details, time spent with Wagan's military records and drawings, as well as questions asked by filmmaker James Foxx that were curiously cut out of the 2000 published interview. This one was the one that was half open and you could see into it but I mean it was just black as like looking into a closet. Alongside the 2000 tape, I have found and will be often referencing Jonathan's outreach to Greer's team from August 2000, just two months before his tape testimony. And of course it goes without saying, I will often be pulling my own clips from my time spent with Jonathan Wagan. With all that being said, let's start our investigation and first travel back all the way to 1997 to relive the experience of Lance Corporal Wagan. And basically I was there and then I was transferred over to the section for laser strike in February of 1997. As a young man, Jonathan Wagan joined the Marine Corps in 1995 until 1998. After a back injury suffered in training, Jonathan's service led him to the second low-altitude air defense battalion within the Marine Corps Air Control Group 28 stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. During this time, Wagan served as a low-altitude air defense gunner with training on Stinger man portable air defense systems, man pads, and Avenger surface-to-air missiles, SAM platforms. In 1997, Wagan and the USMC MACG-28 were deployed to Bukalpa, Peru to support Operation Laser Strike specifically to operate as perimeter security for mission radar installations and to replace aging hawk missile batteries with Stinger and Avenger missile platforms. Laser Strike was one of numerous US worldwide classified operations under US Southcom or US Southern Command to counter narcotics traffic in Peru. The operation included up to 20 US agencies including the USMC, Drug Enforcement Agency, Air Force, CIA, National Guard, and US Army Special Forces, as well as local Peruvian forces such as Peruvian Air Force or FAP. Laser Strike served to conduct three phases of counter drug operations including illegal use of airspace, alternate transportation modes, and production capabilities. Laser Strike employed several acknowledged data acquisition and radar systems to accomplish its including TPS-43 and relocatable over-the-horizon radar systems, or RothR, and possibly covertly utilize satellites from the Defense Support Program. In 1996, Laser Strike proceeded Operation Green Clover, a similar US Southcom operation to combat narcotics transfer in Peru and Colombia but much smaller in scale. In the 12 month period from April 1996 to April 97, within the timeline of Jonathan's encounter, air and ground-based radar used by Laser Strike tracked 45,000 total aircraft. 5,390 of these were quote-unquote tracks of interest. Only 150 of these were suspected of drug trafficking but only 21 such planes were forced or shot down. However, the exact number of shoot-downs was classified. Three primary locations satisfied this mission conducted in Peru, Puculpa, Andoas, and Iquitos, whose mission was to track, identify, and ground by warning or force drug trafficking aircraft entering or leaving Peruvian airspace. In support of Laser Strike and counter drug operations, US Special Forces were additionally sent to Iquitos Peru to the Mar Forlant Riverine Training Team to train with Peruvian military forces. US Southcom authorized up to 14 Special Forces deployments to the region during 1997, and one major Special Forces group that aided in South American counter drug operations attached to US Southcom was the US Army 7th Special Forces Group, aka the US Army Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Historically, the 7th Special Forces out of SOCOM or Special Operations Command within the 1st Special Forces Command had previously been deployed in Operation SNOCAP, a drug enforcement agency counter narcotics operation in 9 Latin American countries alongside the US Navy SEALs. The Army 7th Special Forces Group has conducted foreign internal defense, counter drug, and training missions in Central and South America. The 7th specializes in unconventional warfare and direct action, special reconnaissance, counter proliferation of WMD, or warheads of mass destruction, and security force assistance. Why all this discussion of Green Berets and Special Operations Command units attached to Laser Strike? Recall how quite often I discuss the involvement of Special Operations Command, or their elite component command, JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command in UFO crash retrieval operations. Well, this will all become apparent quite soon when discussing Wagan's retrieval encounter. Up to his involvement in Laser Strike, Jonathan had no interest in the subject of UFOs, but his worldview was somewhat shaken during his guard station performing perimeter security at his Laser Strike radar installation. Wagan would state in the command center of the radar installation he would overhear USAF personnel discussing aircraft tracked flying in and out of the atmosphere at Mach 10 plus. I knew that these these aircraft were flying because I had been in the command center there at the radar installation and I heard a couple women there in the Air Force talking about aircraft flying in and out of the atmosphere at Mach 10 plus. So these aircraft are flying around there, you know, they're re-entering the atmosphere or whatever they're talking about. We got these aircraft flying again and the other girl says, yeah, you know, they're coming in and out of the atmosphere. There's our stuff and so there's our aircraft, and they're like, you know, I can't remember what she said. Wagan would even state an Air Force Colonel would enter the command center about 30 minutes after this conversation and confiscate logbooks tracking flight data. I'm not sure, but I think these logs did contain those tracks, otherwise they wouldn't have taken them. And we're talking about, you know, there's hundreds, thousands of aircraft flying through there, you know, weekly and all these logs, you know, they're writing them in and, you know, and they're keeping their writing, you know, how many times certain aircraft or they get certain vectors for aircraft that are supposed to be around it. I mean, when you got, when you got objects that are re-entering the atmosphere and then stopping on a dog and then turning around and going exactly the opposite direction, that's kind of strange. Meteors don't do that. Oh, is this something that was rare or something that was happening? Oh, this was happening all the time. There was like three or four incidents where I was duty there that the same, the same Air Force officer came in there to give books. And do you think these were tracked on to the freight arts? Yeah, these were tracked from this particular radar that were logged in. The reason, I guess the reason they were taking them is they didn't want people to know that they're tracking these aircraft. I guess, I mean, give us, I'm just assuming that. One night while on guard duty at around 11 p.m. to midnight between April and March 1997, Wigant was approached by Staff Sergeant Monteligre, Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Adkins, and told that there was a downed aircraft, possibly friendly, and that he and other Marines were needed to secure the crash site. By three to four a.m., Jonathan, Adkins, and Allen were in the vanguard of a group of Humvees among eight to 10 Marines sent to secure the crash area. After a combination of driving and trekking through the jungle, the Marines reached the site around six to seven a.m. And they, they came to us and said, look, you know, we got, we got a situation where we, we have an aircraft crash that's possibly friendly and they need us to go and secure the crash site and we're like fine. So this is early, this is late at night. I'm about 11 or 12 at night. I was on guard duty that night. So I was already up and it was my shift. We have 12 hour shifts, 12 on, 12 off, and where we, where we rotate our section. So we all went out that night. We got up I don't know, three or four in the morning and headed out in Humvees. We had about five or six Hummers and we drove to where we needed to go. And then we, from there, you know, we had to hump through the bush. So we got there, I don't know, six, seven, just, just one daylight had just just started to get light. And well, we found the area really easy because there was a, there was a huge gash in the land where, where something had crashed. And it, it didn't break anything. You know, you know, I don't know if you've ever been to a crash site where, you know, you had, you know, had trees, you know, just broken like, like in half. Everything was burned. And it was like, like if you had almost cut like a warm butter with a knife, I mean, it was just, it's like, it's, it's like something on fire or had energy or some kind of energy and like a laser almost had, had like gutted. I mean, it was really strange. And anyway, I was, I was in the front with Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Ankins. We were up front. And we were, we were point basically. And we were like, I don't know, 10, 20 meters and head of everyone else. We had, we all had maps and radios and compasses. So we knew so we wouldn't get lost. And basically, we were the first ones to see the object. And basically what happened is we didn't go straight up the hill. Because basically this thing went up the hill and then off into the side of the ravine of the ridge. This is about a 200 foot ridge, at least solid granite. I mean, it's rock. I don't know if it's granite. It was buried in the side of the cliff. But anyway, we didn't go straight up. We went to the, to the, to all to the left and walked up to the top of the ridge. And that's when we saw the craft. But I mean, it had landed and cut its way through the jungle and embedded itself in the, in like a, I don't know what you would call it almost like a saddle or one of these kind of foothills. It's kind of a ridge and it went into the side of it. And I can't remember how far from the initial impact that when it landed, it actually physically hit the deck and then went in. I don't know how far down it was. Yeah, yeah, man. It burned itself like into the deck, you know, like a foot or two. I don't know. It was deep. The terrified and confused Marines climbed down the ridge to get closer to this object with Waygant getting the closest of all the Marines. Waygant Allen and Adkins observed a huge ship embedded at a 45 degree angle into the rocky cliff face. This is the craft. This is pretty crude two dimensional drawing. But this is jungle here. And this was the craft and it was embedded in the rock like this. And I'm not sure if this tapered off or how it went. But these right here are the hatches, these two objects here. This one was the one that was half open. And you could see into it. But I mean, it was just black is like looking into a closet. Damage I think from the missile. And these were these large vents, they look like they went into the craft, but I couldn't tell. But I mean, it was a shadow. That was the only thing that really cast a shadow. The rest of this was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow where you could see where there wasn't light. But the sun was shining around on the object and it didn't cast a shadow not on anything. It was like kind of like absorbing the light. It's weird. Strange. There was no reflection or anything like that. The object was a massive metallic egg or teardrop shape measuring 10 meters in height and 20 meters in length. Probably like three or four standard 53 foot trailers wide and about three, like like one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. So about 16 of those together. So it was pretty big, man. It was catastrophic damage likely leading to the crash of the vehicle was visible. No debris littered the area, but Wageant observed an enormous gash in the rear of the craft. Jonathan guessed this damage to be from Hawk MIM-23 missile batteries. Although Hawk systems were phased out of military use in 1994, the USMC maintained usage until 2002. However, Wageant guessed the Hawk system used to down the craft was used by the Peruvian Air Force. This being because the USMC phased out Hawk missiles from laser strike in early 1997. Though he has no direct knowledge to this day, Wageant after extensive studying of MIM-23 ballistics believes Hawk fragmentation missiles caused the damage and downing of the craft. Yeah, well, what I think happened, I think a lot of that fragmentation like went into the craft and like bounced around right after it got headed as it was going down. So it probably didn't come out. But like I said, if the missile had hit depending on what the craft was made of and depending on the speed of the missile and its angle and all that, I think it probably would have penetrated and exploded and it would have just disintegrated the ship totally. This then presents a unique question. How could a conventional missile down a highly advanced non-human craft? Similar intriguing incidents like a quote-unquote one in a million targeting of a teardrop shaped UFO by a naval destroyer in 1973 was discussed in my last project on naval legacy programs. MIM-23 Hawk missiles are unique. Hawks are not only able to utilize conventional missiles but also airburst rounds which exploded near not on a target to damage enemy personnel or vehicles with devastating fragmentation. Perhaps a conventional missile could never hit a moving UFO but perhaps in this case a hawk MIM-23 got just close enough to frag and down a target. But let's get back to the wreckage. The best way Wigant could describe the craft was metallic but organic almost as if it was alive. The object did not appear as if it was made of machine parts but more sculpted. The craft was purplish green and fluctuating in color almost like gasoline on water. This effect is known as the mother of pearl effect and the changing colors would sometimes even make the craft near translucent. Well I thought at one point it looked half like green and half purple and then it was kind of it was it was changing the image of the not not the physical properties of it how it was was constructed or whatever but that there was some kind of field on it and it was going like I said with Greer it was like you know when you wash your car would you know fluid right with like palm olive or whatever disc detergent and when it bubbles up it gives like the the color chemical rainbow it was like that but all over the craft and it was kind of like moving around weird I can't so it wasn't just no no it was it was kind of like moving around and going sometimes it would go like completely like almost like silver right the disabled craft was dripping a liquid with the viscosity of syrup this liquid had poured all over the surrounding foliage that hatch that was a jar or busted open broke open that's where the liquid seemed to come from right and it seemed to come out of there and it was everywhere man it was clear well no the the the whatever that stuff was I don't know what to call it the fluid it was clear like just you know water water clear the fluid was clear yeah but it was viscous like yeah but it was thick like maple syrup a large sweeping light traveled around the circumference of the vehicle that slowed until the vehicle seemingly powered off along with this sweeping light wagan could hear the craft dimming until it went silent wagan described the sound as a guitar amplifier there was there was one light on it that slowly went around and in the machine I could hear it I can hear I guess because it was still functioning and had like a like a hum to it like like a really bass like say if you unplugged an amp from a guitar that kind of you know it was really really you know it's really deep but it was loud it was loud man it was like a deep like that like you know rap it would be it would have been like several orders of magnitude louder than you know the real deep bass rap boom boom boom right it was like boom it was like this but it was more like a I don't know man I just can't describe it's not even like that man it's just indescribable it was that light cycling it's almost sounded like a chemical sound man like a chemical like watery kind of like sound man like you're it's weird and that light was slowing down right yeah it finally stopped right everything like shut off this sound of a guitar amp is almost identical to the testimony of former marine michael herera who described the same sound emanating from an eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle as jonathan got closer to the craft he was able to make out more surface detail such as the craft not being smooth but featuring what looked to be notches and bumps 50 to 100 yards away from the craft jonathan got the mysterious liquid all over what marines call camis or battle dress uniform the liquid discolored his camis like acid and ate jonathan's skin so you got within like 150 or 300 view of this right this thing was so high up on the cliff phase you got some of this liquid on yeah yeah it was everywhere man and what did it do to you what did it do to your clothes well i mean they took my clothes but my basic my hair on my legs went away and it's never really come back i lost all my hair on my on my on my legs determined yet frightened the young lance corporal maintained his gaze on this incredible ship the crashed vehicle additionally featured large vents on the freestanding side wagant described similar to fish gills though he could only see one side of the craft jonathan wagered these same gills he guessed were used for propulsion were featured on the other side of the craft yeah on the part of it looked like i don't know what it was but yeah it had sort of like these um under a really tight kind of like ellipse that ran down the side like got small got got progressively smaller and i only saw it like a couple freaking times because it was the weird i don't know what it was the all i could say it was like some type of four shield i don't know what it was three seemingly non-flush hatches sat near the top of the craft one of these hatches being half open although no lights were visible from behind the hatch wagant did observe what appeared to be a four-fingered arm hanging limply from the open hatch this element of wagant's testimony was seemingly cut from his 2000 interview with wagant confirming to me that it must have indeed been cut as he did inform greer of this arm yeah one of the creatures was his arm and hand was hanging out he was hanging out did it come out was it hanging out when you walked up to it or was it yeah he was hanging out probably dying i don't know about the other pilot i don't know what they were to be honest with you but i guess you could call them aliens or whatever i guess that would be yeah yeah right and uh one of i think he was dying almost or close to death right from the crash but like i said this is this is what i thought at the time i mean i don't know this detail is very interesting as i am reminded of the 1965 keksburg pennsylvania crash retrieval encounter where multiple eyewitnesses described biologics inside the bell shaped craft whose appendages were visible once a craft hatch had opened and the vehicle was depressurized so you and two sergeants kind of who led the vanguard got the closest to craft but you got the closest right i was the closest to it and the other two sergeants were kind of standing a little bit off while you got right yeah and i ran up to it was there anything weird about your guys's compasses comms yeah all that was all you know it wasn't working so your compass was it just going haywire yeah it was spinning around around the same time jonathan felt like a presence was reaching out to contact him you got a clear sense that there were some kind of life forms yes it was life forms and the ship i and i could they were it's almost like if someone was like reading your mind and that's the way it felt and i felt like i felt a presence it's like supernatural you know but i felt this presence that it's real strange i guess it was almost like i think the kree i told leslie is i thought the creatures were they called me and it was like weird they were i think they were trying to communicate with me like i guess telepathically it's really weird i don't believe in it and any of that stuff but anyway it was i could i could hear like it was terrible because it kept going and then it still comes and goes it's like basically sitting in your car and turning on like an am station that's not the you know it's just white noise just turning on really high and that's what i heard when i when i first got in there and i didn't ask any of the other guys that i was with if they heard that or anything jonathan was mesmerized by this presence he felt the creatures were informing him that everything would be all right but we're also requesting his help he was so spellbound he ignored the cries and cussings of sergeants alan and adkins who stood away from the craft shouting at wey gantt not to get any closer they were they were scared it was the apprehension the fear and then they they were not here at home is that's really what what it felt like and i mean that's not that's not my own emotions that was something that they were projecting towards me like if somebody would shadow like a spotlight i mean that's what i felt they were directing their thoughts at me i mean this is not i mean i didn't think about all this at the time but it's been the currencies were i've seen the creatures of my in my thoughts and i've seen i saw them what they look like and they projected and i didn't i didn't tell leon i didn't tell leslie this you know i was it was like you know it was the grays basically and and i'm not just saying that but and i never really was into the ufo stuff and i didn't read books on when i was a kid but basically the the oval that the the oval egg had with big dark eyes big eyes our nose and small mouth new ears i think i've had you know dreams of them i don't you know so but i didn't see them but they were not the small you know small kind of like three or four foot right they were huge you said these were tall like eight to ten feet yeah they were huge yeah what it what were their heads like like classic yeah classic but really like elongated kind of coming up like this and they'd have been probably this big like a balloon yeah no like the kind of like the more oblong shape not like the classic if you look at communion right the wittly streber right but the artwork they have on there they would not have been fat like that they were more skinnier but they were also like on a kind of a skinny heart they were projecting that they weren't here they were here they were here they weren't here you know that they weren't not going to harm me that was basically that everything is going to be all right just help me get this helps get out of here i think do i don't i don't know how many were on the craft yeah that's more than one yeah definitely more than one probably about four or five i don't know just this not i mean not a water's number the communication from the occupants of the craft as well as the appearance of the craft led jonathan to believe this vehicle was controlled via thoughts with the massive discussion of psionics here in 2025 through the testimony of jake barber and sky watchers this early mention of basically psionics in 2000 by wagant is extremely interesting additionally i have discussed before dating all the way back to the 1950s stories and testimonies of ufo's being controlled with consciousness headband transceivers are unique control mechanisms to learn more about this subject i do recommend checking out my video on the claims of colonel philip j corso after about 15 to 20 minutes at the site wagant and the other marines embarked to climb back up the ridge to rendezvous with the rest of the mac g28 marines when they were greeted by two to four army ch-47 helicopters flying overhead preparing to land in a nearby clearing when jonathan and the others climbed to the top of the gorge the marines were quickly intercepted by armed men dressed in black fatigue styled similarly to a swat team it was almost like they were there already they were on the ground already and and whoever was flying over was coming in after they these guys had landed so i'm and i'm not sure where they they landed where they were but they were just there on top of the site within a few minutes and so i can't remember exactly how it's speculation on your part you don't know for sure but you think it's possible that team may have been there first yeah they were all they were definitely there first and they were monitoring us too i'm sure they knew we were in the area we got up there and you're but they looked army but they didn't have you know insignia on them right they were same color and all this these men spoke with american dialects but bore no insignia patches or identification the men were older in their late 30s and 40s and immediately showed signs of extreme hostility and aggression black bdus right what was the army would call bdus like our camis right they're like our our uh fatigues but they would have been totally black totally black sure and they had helmets on um no the guys that were on the deck no they had uh those uh they had boony caps and they had just the soft uh army covers round army covers do you remember what kind of weapons they had was it back here in the marisa i think they had mp3s and and glocks and shotguns okay so i think maybe there was a few m16s i mean this has been a long time they had many guns on the on the on the uh 47s so the ch is actually had they had many guns on the side did they have a man at the gun yeah they had a man and he was wearing like this skull type of freaking helmet man it's like a really wicked yeah it looks so when when this team encountered you guys did they have their weapons trained at you were you not at gunpoint oh yeah and so they immediately start do they strip you guys of gear what do they rough you up yeah no they were we were setting our gear up and taking them out and throwing it out and emptying our pockets and everything later in our investigation we will devote a significant amount of time to attempt to track down the origin of this team so sit tight for a little bit having the jump on the marines the unknown operators stripped wagan allen and adkins of their gear and weapons the young lance corporal took a swing at one of the men cracking him on his head for his transgressions jonathan was beaten restrained and forced to lie down face down on the jungle floor getting even more of the strange liquid on him during this scuffle a team of near 30 began departing the landed ch 47 helicopters this team featured individuals in rain jackets bearing three letters delta oscar echo oh yeah they were like scientists i suppose they had uh this type of uh like um we call it mop gear right mission oriented protective posture and uh they had gas masks on and like rubber suits and uh they were they were coming around and yet all kinds of weird people there some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on and personal protective gear and uh and it was all different ones different kinds do we is of course the acronym for the infamous department of energy the successor to the atomic energy commission whose 1954 atomic energy act historically served as a monolith to misclassify ufo materials and data as quote unquote trans classified foreign nuclear information is there any indication that department of energy is involved in uap data collection and housing i don't have an answer i can't confirm or deny that in a public setting and could you do it in a secure setting yes the do we really needs no introduction whether it's my work the reporting of chris sharp or the words of david grush the do we is almost always mentioned as a primary pillar of ufo legacy program operations key in my work are the numerous implications of the does ffr dcs or federally funded research and development centers such as laurence livermore national labs low salamos national labs sandia national labs and do we contractors such as triad national security one third of which is run by betel memorial institutes direct involvement in technologies of unknown origin exploitation programs and similar to the seasoned operators soon in this video we will attempt to track down exactly what this do we team was where they were stationed and more in addition to the people in department of energy rain jackets the team featured members dressed in biological containment suits dawned with do we lettering we can't describe these as similar to spacesuits it wasn't like that it was more high-tech like this big jumpsuits that you zip up the back and you can like we're breathing apparatus in there those guys there was about 30 of them at least and they marched right by me as i was i was being taken away they were marching to get down into the cliff i guess they were in there to check this thing out these suits mentioned remindingly closely of myriad crash retrieval team testimonies i've covered in the past and i'm immediately reminded of eyewitness accounts to the 1965 kexburg pennsylvania ufo crash where witnesses claimed that men in quote unquote moon suits carried boxes and equipment into the crash site a little while later there was a large truck pulled in a light colored truck box van pipe out of it there was four guys come out they had what we call moon suits at the time they were white coverall type suit they took a box out of their box maybe four or five foot square they carried down four handles and they carried that down to the object but just right after that there was a military man after being restrained and beaten by the operators jonathan was stripped his underwear by the men in containment suits before having his feet bound and was handcuffed to a stretcher did the other two sergeants have any liquid on them uh no not that i remember i'm the only one i think got hit with all that because they were they they did not go up under the the craft and in the very close immediate vicinity of it at this time wagant was separated from alan and adkins and taken aboard one of the teen's helicopters no no they said that you know that that that that i was they were cussing at me saying that i was a why don't you why don't you f people ever you know pay attention to orders you aren't supposed to be there and you're not supposed to see this and you know you're you're going to be dangerous if we let you go and all this stuff yeah i mean i thought i was i thought they were going to kill me really i thought we have i'm fing finished you wagant was flown to a base different than his deployment site this location featured significantly more permanent structures than his radar site and jonathan guessed this was partially a peruvian military installation curiously here wagant observed not just americans on site but many nationalities there's a lot of other nationalities there are chinese germans i think were there i mean a lot of other people were at this other base but i mean this thing it was really i mean i didn't go in and all they did was take me to like a like a you couldn't call it a cell it was more of like a it was more like an interrogation but i sat in there for i don't know 15 hours yeah they were merged man that was the other thing because yeah a lot of those dudes didn't the china there was two chinese dudes there that i remember they spent very little english but they were in the german the german spent perfect english right they were in military fatigues yeah same black do they have weapons yeah pistols i would assume that they were glocks but i didn't i couldn't see them because they're the they're the standard us pistol like and it covers it up they were holstered on the hip yeah right so this these guys by their black hammies may have been from the same team yeah i was looking at them and they yelled at me they're not for me not to look at them look at them wow i didn't think they wanted me to remember and that's what they why they did that from what you could see what were they doing were they just kind of at general station yeah just whatever they were doing i don't know what they were doing with whatever i have a strong thesis of where this location might be and we will discuss this soon wagant was not taken into a cell or forced into isolated barracks but was instead taken underground and sequestered in an interrogation room where he was contained for up to two days during this hellacious stay jonathan was interrogated and tormented by one of the operators who detained him and i couldn't really relatively identify any of these guys but i knew i knew that i knew one of them was at the crash site because they were one of the guys that i recognized because he was in black fatigue and he's like what you see and he's like weird and he's like growling you know he goes are you a patriot you like the constitution i'm like yeah he's like well we don't we do it you know we're on our own program you know we don't obey we just do what we want he's like yeah and they're like and they're growling and they're relishing you know and they're yelling at me and they're hollering the cursing we didn't see anything you know and we'll do you and your whole family and they're you know it was it was basically that for about eight or nine hours i mean they took breaks basically they're like look man we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna just we're gonna take you off in the helicopter when we was kicked out out of the jungle and you're just gonna get you know we're gonna end you and all this and they didn't physically they didn't physically put their hands on me i was sitting in a chair and i was handcuffed in the chair and i couldn't so basically you know it was just this this like harassment towards the end of his confinement a lieutenant colonel from the air force visited weigand this colonel bore no name tag nor did he disclose his identity the colonel threatened weigand's life repeatedly telling him this clandestine operation would have no trouble leaving weigand dead in the jungle the colonel then made weigand sign multiple documents securing his silence on his incredible yet horrific encounter and he told me you know you know you know if we just took you out in the jungle you know they'd never find you out there and i'm like and you know i didn't want to see you know you know i didn't want to test and see if you'd really do that so i said yeah and he's like you got to sign these papers and you never saw this and i don't exist in this situation never happened and if you tell anybody you know you know you'll just come on messing and and he was a real abrasive just just just a cynical i guess the best way to put it you know what what papers well there were it was a the standard form that you signed for it's like it's almost like a waiver i don't know i'd probably be able to identify another paper like that i guess it's it's for if you if you've seen something you're not supposed to sign that you didn't see it or whatever it's basically a security form i believe and there was two of those that i signed and after that i was driven back to my base jonathan was finally driven back to his original radar installation this is a key point here for our upcoming investigation wagon was in close enough proximity to be driven back to the original base and not flown i don't remember leaving though but i know i went out because they they they put a uh they put a mask over me i had a mask over me when i when i got to the base they put it on before i got out of the helicopter and uh when i left from where i was where they held me they put one on um i mean it had something open where i could breathe but i couldn't see and i couldn't hear and they brought me out and they took me to this flatline jonathan was segregated with use af personnel at his original base for three weeks before being sent back to cherry point while there jonathan had no opportunity to contact allen adkins or the other marines by may of 97 while still in service jonathan became tormented by the event experiencing horrific nightmares missing time and weird dreams none of these symptoms had occurred before witnessing the crash to this day jonathan maintains there were internal usmc attempts to make him appear unstable and an unreliable witness by late 97 jonathan confessed to using banned substances so he could be discharged by the marines around this time mac g 28 and the criminal investigation division made his life horrific and by march of 1998 wagon was discharged now let's move over to investigating the retrieval encounter in extreme detail an attempt to break down every single detail of this retrieval after we climbed back up the uh the i think the doe department of energy people were there they knew about it and i don't know why we went there still in this day but anyway i was arrested uh i had all my gear taken from me by men and black hammies had no no name tags they were older probably in their third late 30s or 40s i got a little scuffle with them and i hit one of them i took a swing one of them and i hit him in the forehead yeah they had they had the big d you know delta oscar echo on the back of their back of a couple the guys were wearing like these uh these rain jackets because it had been raining the fall of the previous day and they were in there and there were other guys that were wearing containment like biological suits it wasn't like that it was more high-tech like those big jump suits that you zip up the back and you can like wear a breathing apparatus in there those guys there was about 30 of them at least and they marched right by me as i was i was being taken away they were marching to get down into the cliff i guess they were in there to check this thing out on their black uniforms was there any sign of rank no no rank okay no name tapes none of that but when you encounter these guys was there any semblance that there was a hierarchy oh yeah there was definitely a yeah there was definitely higher the team leader was he an aggressive one or oh they were all aggressive i just i don't know man to be honest with you could you gauge the temperament of the doe team did they seem to focus on the mission what no they were kind of like power man going crazy running around swarming like rats yeah do they have any equipment yeah i don't know what it was before we investigate let's quickly review jonathan's encounter with this unknown military and scientific team near the crash site ignoring cries of danger by sergeant allen and sergeant adkins lands corporal weigh gantt cut only 15 to 20 minutes at the crash site before two to four us army ch 47 chinooks began to land in the nearby hasty lz climbing out of the ravine the marines were met by operators in black camis featuring no insignia or identification these operators who spoke with american dialects likely arrived prior to the teams in the ch 47s and disarmed and apprehended the marines being a rambunctious young soldier weigh gantt took a swing at one of the clandestine operators connecting his fist with the man's head these rogue operators restrained jonathan and forcefully laid him face down on the ground where he got more of the strange clear syrupy liquid on him while jonathan was being restrained a group of maybe 30 began walking from the landed ch 47s down into the crash site in the ravine the personnel were comprised largely of men in rain jackets marked delta oscar echo or do e aka the department of energy alongside these men were multiple individuals in suits and hazmat gear jonathan described as mission oriented protective posture or mop gear jonathan was forced to strip to his underwear discarding the clothes covered in the mysterious liquid by the suit clad do e personnel before having his hands cuffed feet bound and he was then carried onto a stretcher to one of the ch 47s jonathan was not taken aboard with sergeant atkins and sergeant allen but instead isolated and forcefully taken to an unknown camp let's pause here and break this down jonathan's mention of do e assets in the peruvian jungle gives us some extremely actionable data points remember weigh gantt and his fellow marines learned about the crash between 11 p.m. and midnight departed to investigate around three to four a.m. and arrived to the crash site around six to seven a.m. from intelligence to arrival the marines took a maximum of eight hours in roughly the same time span plus maybe an extra hour or two if the department of energy was privy to advance signals intelligence of the ufo being targeted possibly by peruvian hawk mim 23 missile batteries the do e was able to mobilize american personnel assets and containment suits to secure the crash area this would imply the recovery team was highly organized and likely a rapid reaction recovery unit this unit was able to plan mobilize execute and contain a ufo crash retrieval site within roughly eight to nine hours remember back to my work on us o retrievals in the deep submergence rescue vehicle under project sand such submersibles were deployable anywhere in the world within 72 hours this 30 plus man team was able to deploy and react to peru in roughly 11 percent of that 72 hours in numerous videos in the past i have spoken about ufo crash retrieval rapid recovery units whether this be the use half blue berets allegedly on site for the 1965 kexpert pennsylvania crash retrieval the blue boys rapid retrieval and transport helicopter units relate to lennard stringfield or the rapid response use half unit first on site to the 1953 kingman arizona crash stories of highly structured and efficient dedicated ufo recovery units are inseparable from ufo crash retrieval testimonies in fact wegan's description of the onsite team reminds me extremely closely of an enigmatic brutal and perplexing ufo crash recovery case i have covered before in extreme detail the 1974 koyame mexico ufo crash retrieval this case has very little in the form of evidence-based paper trails but outlines an incredible and logical crash retrieval encounter in this case us intelligence agencies specifically the cia monitored a ufo from the gulf of mexico that after a series of jagged and abrupt turns crashed into the northern chihuahua part of mexico according to the primary source document of this case the allegedly leaked deneve report the cia mobilized a rapid recovery unit out of fort blitz texas this team arrived onsite from four unmarked helicopters including uh1 huys and ch53 superstallions equipped with hazmat gear hazmat or mop gear was required at this crash site according to the deneve report because of a whole containment breach of toxic materials gas or liquid out of the ufo that subsequently killed the mexican military retrieval team there is of course an argument the us rapid recovery team killed these mexican soldiers but that is not our topic let's remain in 1974 to attempt to uncover the origins of this doe team this year saw the creation of the department of energy and national nuclear security administrations nuclear emergency support team formerly known as the nuclear emergency search team aka nest previously i have labeled nest as the onsite retrieval science team wey gantt encountered in the jungles of peru in 1997 just like other excellent researchers like rgh ufo's did before me today however i have even stronger conviction nest handled the recovery of a non-human vehicle and hazardous containment breach of a mysterious liquid suffered by a young marine during operation laser strike but what is this nest nest or nuclear emergency support team was created under executive order 12656 nest was founded as a doe specialized nuclear emergency organization that assisted the fbi and numerous government agencies by quote providing technical expertise and advice in response to a variety of potential incident threats involving nuclear materials end quote analyzing a 1996 nest briefing the closest available document to the time of our crash nest engaged in myriad deployment activities serving as an operational emergency management team or oemt and also as a threat credibility assessor ensuring nest was the quote unquote initial party to the scene on mission deployment sites nest would restrict access perform diagnostics and threat mitigation actions agency planning and coordination as well as handle disablement and cleanup in short nest operated as an umbrella organization to handle all nuclear and radiological emergencies for the department of energy the mission of nest is to be quote prepared to respond immediately to any type of radiological accident or incident anywhere in the world end quote around 1996 nest enjoyed its own arsenal of vehicles including high-tech vans mbb bo 105 helicopters and numerous jets including sesna citation twos that featured a max speed of 464 miles per hour and remember that speed as it will become quite important later on now it is crucial to mention nest personnel did not consist of armed operators therefore it is safe to assume the operators in black camis were not nest operators though it is possible they were still doe assets we will get to that soon personnel in nest circa 1996 included chemists engineers health physicists management and logistics personnel nuclear physicists analysts etc the corporate team members of the nuclear emergency support team consisted of some familiar faces to this channel nest forces have historically been comprised of contractors rather than the department of defense not only did nest partner with raytheon but also e g and g los alamos national labs sandia national labs and laurence livermore national labs as we discussed earlier a cornerstone of my work is discussing the missing link of u.s. government corporate ufo legacy programs the subject matter expert federally funded research and development centers or ffr dcs alongside institutions like the mitre corporation rand corporation center for naval analyses los alamos sandia and laurence livermore national labs operate as ffr dcs for the u.s. department of defense sandia and laurence livermore were also directly accused by usaff master sergeant edgar fuchsia as engineering the propulsion devices from the reverse engineered triangular craft the tr 3b i've also discussed sandia national labs as implicated in ufo technology transfer with at and t and bell labs as well as serving as a ufo legacy program location to house craft and biologics has outlined in the disputed majestic 12 and interplanetary phenomenon unit documents and a quick side note while these documents i just mentioned may be disputed the interplanetary phenomenon unit was proven to exist through foyer requests done by ufo researcher william steinman in the 1980s however according to the army no records of this unit existed due to it existing only through institutional memory los alamos sandia and laurence livermore are labs intimately entwined with ufo lore quite recently i discussed provable subterranean facilities existing below sandia and los alamos and their possible connection to ufo legacy programs and one of nest partners e g and g really needs no introduction this former contractor is infamous in ufo lore serving as the contractor bob lasar claimed employed him to attempt to reverse engineer ufo propulsion devices at area 51 s4 and e g and g's nevada parking lot also served as the meeting place for the disputed but likely accurate 2002 wilson davis meeting notes funny enough nest themselves in a 1995 nest assessment team report stated quote the laboratory program managers enjoy a relatively high degree of autonomy and independence with respect to focusing efforts and funding on those elements of their internal programs which they have deemed to be the most important end quote this intriguing and free management style around nest laboratories arose from the laboratory's heavy focus on research and development activities during formative years under executive order 12656 which created nest the primary authority to nest was the 1954 atomic energy act mention of the atomic energy commission's atomic energy act of 1954 should immediately set off alarm bells this 1954 act has been labeled specifically in the schumer rounds legislation as a system for misclassifying ufo data and materials historically misclassifying them as trans classified foreign nuclear information or by the acronym tfni whether the ufo wagon encountered emitted signs of radiological signatures when tracked by laser strike radar or intelligence agency radars matters not as ufo materials have historically been hidden within the exact 1954 act that provided oversight to nest however it is indeed possible this craft emitted signatures of interest to attract the eyes of the doe recently i covered a 1991 deep sea ufo retrieval case in which a triangular craft that had sat on the sea for 30 or 40 years was recovered by a naval dsrv crew due to survey ships recognizing radioactive signatures from the sea floor further intriguing links exist between jonathan's testimony and nest in february of 1997 just one to two months before wagans encounter nest introduced the jtot or joint technical operations team this team aimed to provide deployable and technical operational support for nest to do d at even faster speeds than present nest teams and this team operated 365 days a year at 24 hours a day let's reference diffusing armageddon inside nest america's secret nuclear bomb squad by author jeffrey t richelson the same author of the us intelligence community that provided extremely valuable information on the national underwater reconnaissance office around 1997 russia blasted a probe from the bay kanor cosmodrome in kazakhstan carrying the mars 96 probe the fourth stage of this proton rocket failed leaving the rocket unable to escape earth mars 96 did not carry an onboard nuclear reactor but did in fact carry 18 small energy generators powered by plutonium 238 but this was enough to get nest's attention us space command estimated the probe was large enough some pieces would survive re-entry and the unlucky countries of origin were estimated to be bolivia or columbia nest debated deployment to bolivia or columbia two countries considered quote-unquote not very important but ceased action once surviving debris landed west of south america in the pacific ocean what is interesting here is that the same year as wagans encounter nest considered deployment to recover a probe in country's neighboring peru nest acted off intelligence gathered from us space command and their defense support program dsp satellites and now i have made an entire video on the subject of fast walkers a term used by us north com and norad to designate any strange object leaving or entering earth's atmosphere at incredible speeds in the 2016 hillary clinton campaign leaks communications were found between clinton campaign manager john pedesta and usg contractor bob fish in these exchanges fish stated quote one of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the usaf dsp satellite program end quote in the same video i covered an incredible dsp fast walker case related to journalist and former army criminal investigation command agent joseph stifula this case allegedly saw a ufo traveling at 22 thousand miles per hour towards earth pass within 1.5 miles of a dsp satellite before changing course and by the way guess which us agency has a history of developing and managing dsp satellites yes the nr o or national reconnaissance office remember from numerous projects of mine and the incredible articles of chris sharp the nr o has been labeled time and time again as a big five us intelligence agency that provides various forms of satellite intelligence for ufo domestic and foreign crash retrieval incidents all this out of jeffrey t richelson's work is to say that there are provable instances of dsp satellites and nest working in conjunction the same year as wagan's testimony to cover debris in south america i think for wagan's case it is highly likely the nr o managed dsp satellites monitoring the egg-shaped crafts crashing in peru and deployed a nest rapid recovery unit to secure the site what strengthens this thesis even more is the fact wagan himself mentioned a bunker below the laser strike radar station that was tracking ufo's as we discussed while performing perimeter security wagan would state how he overheard usaff personnel discussing aircraft flying in and out of atmosphere at mock 10 plus or almost 7700 miles per hour also recall how wagan mentioned us army ch-47s deploying the doe team in a declassified 1995 nest assessment team report we can see the doe ensured with the department of defense that suitable military aircraft would be made immediately available to support an emergency deployment of nest forces and equipment nest also worked closely with the us naval explosive ordinance disposal technology division in us army 52nd ordinance group it is possible in this instance the ch-47 belonged to nest army partners indeed the us army south did begin supporting counter-drug operations in south america in 1995 by providing aircraft such as for uh-60a or black hawks for such operations until one november 1997 but what i think here is that it's quite probable these army ch-47s used to transport the nest team were from the first battalion 228th aviation regiment one 228th aviation is part of joint task force bravo a us south com forward-based expeditionary task force operating to promote stability and security by countering transnational threats including narco traffic throughout the 90s jtf bravo conducted numerous missions in central and south america and saw the us army 7th special forces we discussed earlier work alongside the 128th aviation in support of the peru ecuador 1995 border disputes and interestingly enough throughout the 90s one 228th aviation had headquartered in panama in honduras and featured a fleet of helicopters including ch-47 chinooks i do need to quickly mention we are faced with an additional possibility of the origin of these helicopters as we move on to discuss the black operators and us special forces we must also discuss the 160th special operations aviation regiment a us army special forces special mission unit that provides helicopter aviation support for special operations forces nickname the night stalkers the 160th often works with joint special operations command the night stalkers are some of the army's greatest qualified aviators crew chiefs and support soldiers and employ a massive fleet of helicopters including numerous ch-47 chinooks the night stalkers have even deployed on several missions of interest here including recovering a down soviet helicopter in june of 1988 now there is no record of the night stalkers performing operations in south america during the 1990s in fact closest we can get is deployment out of panama for operation desert storm in 91 obviously with special forces operations there would likely be next to no record of covert activities by the 160th sor in the region but the reason i suspect the 128th aviation from jtf bravo ch-47 chinooks were used over the highly qualified special operations force the night stalkers is because of provable ch-47s existing under the 128th aviation and south coms domain at the time of our crash retrieval incident the night stalkers are stationed out of fort camble kentucky and it is technically impossible for the team to have flown chinooks to peru and commence the operation in the roughly nine hours we outlined for the doe team but this is all to say it is very possible elements of the night stalkers were stationed in south coms domain as part of a ufo rapid recovery team especially if laser strike had already monitored numerous ufos but for now we are forced to look at provable existing vehicles in the region that would satisfy the retrieval operation and now this brings us to the armed men in black camis with no insignia i do think we are faced with a few possibilities here in the same 1995 nest assessment team report we can see nest additionally worked alongside us special operations and us navy special operations i have often spoke and reflected on the work of excellent journalist chris sharp exposing the cia's office of global access born in 2003 out of the cia directorate of science and technology the office of global access or oga was accused by sharp as participating in foreign ufo crash recovery operations while oga provided operational logistics and intelligence agencies provided various forms of intelligence sharp labeled jsoc or joint special operations command as serving as the boots on the ground force for such retrieval operations and as we discussed earlier joint special operations command is a subordinate command within special operations command sharp myself and others have accused jsoc in the socom as participating directly in ufo crash retrievals interestingly jsoc is comprised of the best of the best of us special forces delta for seal team six the 24th sts regimental reconnaissance company and the intelligence support activity the shadowy intelligence support activity is often known as the most mysterious unit of jsoc task force orange as it sometimes referred to was originally created under us army inscom or intelligence and security command us army inscom was created under general albert stubblebine a figure famous in ufo lore stubblebine showed keen interest in utilizing psi phenomena such as remote viewing for military usage and has also been accused by numerous individuals such as philip j corso and steven as participating directly in ufo legacy program operations at fort hachuka arizona all this is to say i do think it is highly likely wegan encountered unmarked socom or jsoc units alongside the doenest team the question here is were these units currently stationed in peru for laser strike or deployed rapidly from a base similar to the doenest crew this is up for debate but i do have my own strong thesis here let's break this down wegan did state during his deployment performing perimeter security for laser strike he did encounter special forces operators training as a matter of fact us special forces were deployed to peru during this time let us analyze in 1996 to 1997 document pulled from the defense technical information center titled the us military and drug war in peru as we mentioned earlier this document details 14 special forces counter drug deployments to peru conducted by us south com or us southern command these forces would regularly engage in riverine training as it turns out and this will become extremely important soon us south com held the mar forlant marine forces atlantic riverine training team in iqitos peru for utilization under operation laser strike iqitos is a host to all sorts of us military installations of interest we will touch on soon circling back there is the south com unit deployed to peru in 1997 we discussed earlier i highly suspect did indeed intercept wegan and his fellow marines and secured a ufo crash site these being the us army seventh special forces unit aka the us army green berets due to their consistent execution of us south com missions including a historical presence training encountering narcotic distribution in central and south america especially in northern peru i wager here the army seventh special forces were quote-unquote recruited by doe nest to serve as the enforcement arm of a ufo crash retrieval operation now there is a secondary argument here of who these operators could be far less likely in my opinion but still worth exploring this being the department of energy special response team these anti-nuclear terrorist teams are the doe's own elite task force an elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across the continental united states the special response team has a rest on site authority and at least in the 1980s dawned all black camis similar to the outfits described by wagan historically in the late 90s doe srt units also provided security for sensitive doe defense nuclear facilities including low salamos national labs and laurence livermore national labs sound familiar these teams were trained by wacken hut wacken hut was a private security company i have talked about extensively had historically guarded usa legacy program sites through their industrial security expertise former cia director and director of naval intelligence admiral bobby ray inman who admitted to nasa mission specialist bob eschler recovered ufos may one day become available for scientific research once served as chairman of wacken hut while i can find no data to suggest doe srt's have ever operated outside of the united states it stands to reason such a team could travel with nest assets to incredibly sensitive materials such as a crashed ufo protected by the 1954 atomic energy agreement act after all our investigation into the team with delta oscar echo on their protection suits and rain jackets as well as the armed anonymous americans and black camis i think we can construct a powerful thesis us forces engaged in counter narcotics reconnaissance systems for operation laser strike monitored a ufo in addition to radar it is likely the defense support program satellites run by the nr o either picked up the same ufo or elements of laser strike were also involved with the defense support program the ufo then crashed in wagan's estimate this crash was caused as we discussed earlier by peruvian air force surface to air hawk missile batteries from data gathered by intelligent sources likely dsp with support from the nr o a doe nest retrieval team was dispatched via internal nest jet assets with a point of origin in the mainland united states the southern most nest facility here is sandia national labs in new mexico the nest team either departed with a doe special response team srt or leveraged green beret special forces assets to provide on-site protection for securing the crash zone nest also leveraged per their dod authority several us army ch47 chinooks from either the 160th soar night stalkers or one 228th aviation from jtf bravo station nearby in us south com territory during the crash recovery and deployment of on-site directives nest and the first to arrived armed entourage encountered a group of marines that had happened upon the crash site first one marine resisted detainment and was confined due to coming in contact with possibly hazardous materials leaking from the non-human craft the young marine was stripped of his contaminated clothes by nest personnel in biohazard suits isolated from his fellow marines and taken to a secure base with medical facilities for quarantine interrogation and debrief the mac g28 marine was held in isolation for up to 48 hours threatened repeatedly and forced under fear of death to sign confidentiality agreements the marine was then driven back to his operational base where he was soon forced to return to cherry point north carolina okay now that we have outlined our thesis let's step back and explore this piece by piece we must start by analyzing where exactly was jonathan wagon stationed and where may of this crash occurred operation laser strike was conducted primarily in puculpa peru however there were two secondary locations that supported operation laser strike and peruvian counter drug operations while also featuring tps 43 radar systems within iqitos and andoas many familiar with the case of wagon believes he was stationed at puculpa the primary laser strike facility and while this is indeed possible i would like to propose a secondary possible station elements of laser strike are still classified to this day and i know this because i've spoken to one of the marines wagon described he was with in his testimony the marine refused to discuss many details of laser strike with me since the operation was still classified to me this partially rules out puculpa as the base at which jonathan alan adkins and others were stationed but why puculpa at least since 2001 has received public as a laser strike location one of the marines i talked to his unwillingness to speak about their base of operations leads me to believe it was not puculpa furthermore wagon stated his unit flew into lima peru via c 130 then took a multiple hour flight with one stop to travel to their operational base jonathan was unaware of where exactly this location was and puculpa is around 300 miles from lima at the cruise speed of a c 130 this journey from lima to puculpa would take less than one hour however there was a laser strike location up north in peru that existed more than 630 miles away from lima at a cruising speed a c 130 would take near two hours to complete this journey with an added stop this satisfies our journey conditions of several hours this laser strike location is usaf detachment five in iqitos peru detachment five is a very private installation i can only find one mention of in the 1990s or onward iqitos is home to usaf radar detachment five the mar forlant riverine training team discussed earlier in namru six now called namru south aka the navy medical research unit all three of these locations significance will become apparent very soon especially when wegan't discuss the facility he was taken to by the doe team and the permanent structures there on site now i can find next to no information about the andoas laser strike site but these aforementioned locations at iqitos lead me strongly to believe iqitos is the correct location wegan't stated his radar station was tracking narcotics traffic from analyzing narco routes from 1998 we can see drug transport routes passing directly through iqitos peru but let's go step by step through the incident and try to reconstruct wegan't's encounter jonathan was informed of a crashed aircraft near 11 p.m to midnight by three to four a.m the lance corporal sergeant adkins sergeant allen's and multiple marines and humvees departed for the crash area after a combination of driving and trekking the marines reached the crash area as the sun was rising around six to seven a.m what this means is that from the time the marines left their base of operations which i highly suspect is the enigmatic usaff radar detachment five in iqitos peru to the time the marines got to the crash only between two and four hours had elapsed but let's break this down remember wegan't claimed the marines drove humvees and trekked to the crash area wegan't would also make mention that while he was analyzing the craft up close he was incredibly sweaty but made no mention of fatigue due to the hiking while a marine equipped with a full loadout and weapon would certainly get quite sweaty quickly in the peruvian air average temperatures in march and peru are only 77 degrees fahrenheit with a sunrise temp being much cooler due to these factors we will take the average time elapsed to the crash site three hours and assume the marines drove for two and a half hours and trekked for 30 minutes humvees drive at max speeds of 70 miles per hour but operate conservatively especially on jungle terrain and roads therefore we will assume the caravan of marines traveled at 35 miles per hour at two and a half hours of driving this means if the marines traveled in a straight line the soldiers could have traveled near 88 miles the average human hikes at roughly two to three miles per hour and we will assume here trained soldiers who got a pep in their step could trekk two miles in 30 minutes with this information and a tremendous amount of error and i fully understand my calculations are based on heavy assumptions we can assume the crash occurred in a 90 mile radius outside of iquitos to try and correct for some of my error here i will give a plus minus of 25 percent error we are then left with this general area of where the crash may have occurred now recall wegan did say the crash occurred just over the border but he stated the bolivian borders specifically 5 to 10 miles from the bolivian border now if wegan's testimony is true this means he either got the border of bolivia incorrect confusing the country with the borders of either brazil or columbia or he was stationed at a secretive location in southeast peru that featured multiple camps and permanent structures now i tend to believe the former and that jonathan misspoke as his laser strike installation was tasked with tracking bolivian narco traffic and iquitos employed a significant amount of us do d permanent structures and assets that line up with jonathan's testimony and the timeline of events what reinforces this thesis is the point we discussed earlier that the us army seventh special forces and joint task force bravo containing the first battalion 228th aviation regiment had historically conducted us south com missions in northern peru during the 1955 peru ecuador border dispute so it is interesting the men in black camis i wager where us army seven special forces were already available to secure the crash site in northern peru anyways we can conclude from the exploration above wegan adkins and the fellow marines uncovered the crashed ufo 5 to 10 miles from either the columbian or brazilian border in one of these two general regions within 15 to 20 minutes the marines arriving the crash site was secured by multiple us army ch-47 helicopters doe personnel and armed men in black camis wagantis certain arrived to the scene before the ch-47s it was almost like they were there already they were on the ground already and and whoever was flying over was coming in after they these guys had landed so i'm and i'm not sure where they landed where they were but they were just there on top of the site within a few minutes i can't remember exactly how it's speculation on your part you don't know for sure but you think it's possible that team may have been there first yeah they all they were definitely there first and they were monitoring us too i'm sure they knew we were in the area when we got up there near it but they looked army but they didn't have you know insignia on them right they were same color and all this from the data we've discussed above an involvement of nr row managed dsp satellites i wager this rapid reaction retrieval team had maybe one hour advanced notice of the crash to the marines therefore let's assume this retrieval team had a maximum of nine hours to gather intelligence assemble brief and reach the crash site with a detailed operational plan remember at this time nes teams were historically stationed at us department of energy laboratories so i think it is extremely unlikely any team would have been stationed in south america at this time in this instance one of the closest major labs to iqitos peru is a regular tricky customer of this channel central new mexico's sandia national labs and recall back to discussing nest in the 1996 nest briefing nest was not only permitted to commandeer any do d assets but also employed their own fleet of vehicles including sesna citation two jets so my theory here would see a nest team departing sandia heading directly to iqitos u.s military infrastructure via sesna citation two jets from iqitos or nearby south com installations the team would commandeer us ch 47 helicopters likely from joint task force bravo and recruit nearby special forces from the riverine training team or utilize a jsocker does rt team that traveled with the nest team sandia's nearby largest city is santa fe new mexico and using santa fe as a reference point travel distance to iqitos is 3446 miles a sesna citation two travels at top speed of 464 miles per hour logically assuming the team wished to arrive to the retrieval site with haste this flight would have taken around seven and a half hours from iqitos the team would have a very short flight to arrive to the crash area around 90 to 100 miles away in a ch 47 that travels 180 to 196 miles per hour at top speed so this journey here on the shorter end would have taken roughly 30 minutes this means the nest team would have only required around eight hours total of travel time with roughly one hour left for personnel and gear gathering necessary ground briefings etc a tight squeeze but one that very well fits in the framework of wegan's testimony and then they took me in the ch 47 and they they sent me to we we took off and and uh and uh they they didn't drug me or anything like that and i was just awake there and and they had me in a uh your question again is how long was i contained your subdued i don't know for about two days i think i don't know no i don't i don't know they i didn't know where i was because we landed and um we we we we flew and then we landed and then uh they took me out and it was still i mean you know it's it wasn't in the same area that i was at this is more of like there were structures prominent structures there i think was peruvian military but all this thing man all i saw there was americans and there's a lot of other nationalities there are chinese germans i think were there i mean a lot of other people weren't at this other base but i mean this thing was really i mean i didn't go in and all they did was take me to like uh like us you couldn't tell it itself was more of like uh it was more like an interrogation but i sat in there for how long they had 15 hours land's corporal wegan was isolated from adkins allen and the other marines he was flown to a location that was not his base of operations which i wager was in iqitos now what's interesting is this location was close enough to his original station that after one to two days of captivity wegan was driven back before being kept with usaf personnel for three weeks another nod towards iqitos being the correct location with usaf detachment five before being shipped back to cherry point at this interrogation room wegan was contained isolated and threatened by some of the operators and black camis and was then forced to sign documents swearing his silence by a usaf colonel describing this location wegan made a very interesting set of remarks the location at which he was interrogated employed permanent structures not makeshift forward operating bases like pulcapa laser strike location it was at this base where he was interrogated he observed multiple different nationalities in one area americans peruvians chinese and germans also recall twice wegan got the mysterious liquid leaking from the craft on him once during his initial investigation of the crash site in a second time when the black operators forcefully took him to the ground wegan also stated here the doe team and hazmat gear stripped his clothes covered in the liquid due to these statements plus wegan being isolated from adkins and allen i do think it likely the doe nest team had concerns wegan was contaminated from interacting with the liquid for this reason i do have high suspicion wegan was taken to namru 6 or namru south the navy medical research unit with offices in lima peru and ikitos the us navy employs various namru locations around the globe which serve as dod laboratories and centers namru sa at joint base san antonio texas namru 3 formally in egypt now in siginella naval air station sicily italy namru endo pacific in singapore naval base namru south with offices in lima and ikitos peru and namru d at right patterson air force base ohio namru locations absolutely fit the dictionary definition of multicultural environments namru installations serve as a network of biomedical research labs operated by the us navy namru operates to conduct r&amp;d on infectious diseases bio defense and numerous medical topics related to military and public health namru is part of the navy medical research command that conducts biomedical research to meet the needs of the navy and marine corps german nationalists that specifically namru south are also not uncommon even in 2023 we can find examples of german military and ambassadors visiting namru's lima location in my opinion namru would serve as a perfect location for jonathan to be taken this location is within driving distance to ikitos usaf detachment 5 and close to the us marfor lint riverine training team and obviously this location is a sensible holding in quarantine zone for a us marine who is exposed to possibly toxic materials in non-human craft now i do need to mention of course this theory is not without its own kinks wegan stated he was only at this location for two days and while he was contained in an interrogation type room he was still in close proximity to the usaf lieutenant colonel that forced him to sign papers in the operator who threatened his life one might assume wegan would have had to be quarantined for up to a week in isolation and would have had to undergo numerous medical procedures to determine if any risk of sickness or contamination resided from the fluid and wegan did specifically tell me he did not have to undergo any sort of medical procedures at this location other factors at play do need to be worked through for this namru theory such as the multi-nationals jonathan described being armed operators and not diplomats as well as this holding location being underground remember this crash occurring near ikitos is just a theory of mind constructed from the best available evidence for this crash retrieval testimony but even so i do believe ikitos peru serves as the primary focus for our ufo crash retrieval and forced holding of lance corporal jonathan wegan i have contacted countless individuals named by wegan are possibly involved in this crash retrieval case these include multiple usaf personnel from my keto's detachment five including lieutenant colonel gala biles second lieutenant randall rothman and staff sergeant robert mcowd of the 649th combat logistics support squadron this outreach was conducted in an attempt to identify if ikitos was indeed where wegan was stationed i plan to inquire if us marines from the mac g28 performed perimeter security for the site if a doe team ever stationed briefly at detachment five or borrowed their aircraft or if stories floated around of a marine who went missing that turned up two days later as of today i have had no luck contacting any usaf personnel involved in laser strike due to repeatedly hearing that some details of the op are still classified i am not holding my breath however i will continue to pursue any and all leads jonathan wegan did directly state a staff sergeant montaligre knew about the crash site and that sergeant allen and sergeant adkins had both accompanied wegan to the site and observed the crash day with 100 confidence i have identified all three of these men and all three are real usmc veterans and enjoyed long accomplished careers with the corps after laser strike and i reached out to all three on multiple platforms and as of this date only one marine has responded i choose to keep the identity of this marine anonymous out of respect to the individual and to his service to the united states i will also refrain from posting screenshots as i do not wish to break this individual's trust nor do i have his permission to do so i reached out to these marines from this channel's email address uapgerb at gmail.com which i highly encourage any first hand ufo legacy program witnesses to contact this email does not contain my identity to protect my anonymity i emailed one of these sergeants asking to talk to him about his service during laser strike in 1996 to 1997 i did also state that my outreach concerned an encounter relayed by a mac g28 lance corporal but with held wegan's name who claimed he alongside a handful of sergeants encountered a unique downed aircraft the sergeant responded hello and addressed me gerb by both my first and my last name in this exchange the sergeant continued quote the operation is still classified however there was no incident involving a unique downed aircraft that i know of or encountered during my deployment i can speak to what never happened during my deployment and not cross the classification restrictions of the operation and quote the sergeant reckoned i had received bad intel regarding his involvement in the suggested incident i was pursuing i then asked the marine if he had ever heard of a lance corporal's testimony of a crashed egg-shaped vehicle that involved several other marines that may have been downed by human military assets such as hawk mim 23 missile batteries the marine responded he was aware of a lance corporal wegan that served under his platoon much of this response by the sergeant focused on hawk surface to air missile systems and the impossibility that the usmc employed a hawk battery during 1997 and of course wegan does agree with this point hawk missile batteries were phased out of us forces in 1994 the marine corps continued usage until 2002 but laser strike ceased usage of hawk in 1997 since his original testimony wegan only theorized that this craft had been hit by a hawk system and that the missile battery likely belonged to local peruvian forces and wegan held this theory due to the ballistic and fragging pattern of damage on the egg-shaped craft wegan spent a tremendous amount of time studying hawk mim 23 systems and maintains this conclusion to this day the sergeant not only claimed wegan never deployed in support of operation laser strike but also stated wegan's story was false and while he was a good young respectful obedient and dedicated marine he also suffered a medical condition quote he was never a participant in any clandestine operations or efforts he was just an laad marine and that was all end quote now let me be clear here i fully respect this marine in question after all he dedicated much of his life to the service of this country but i do have quite a few problems here with his statements jonathan wegan never once claimed to participate in any clandestine operations this encounter simply involved a group of mac g28 marines sent out by their radar detachment to secure the lz of a downed aircraft the mac g28 marines in this testimony clearly conflicted with the clandestine mission of the do enes team i also find the claims wegan never deployed to laser strike to be quite curious laser strike was indeed a classified mission the marine i spoke to claimed wegan may have picked up bits and pieces of deployment information for marines that did indeed deploy to laser strike but i find this unlikely in wegan's testimony and all the way back to his initial outreach to steven greer on one august 2000 the young lance corporal described operation laser strike extremely accurately and the only detail that stands out as odd is how jonathan claimed his usaf radar base was near the bolivian border i still maintain he likely meant iqitos near the columbian and brazilian borders mac g28 marines from jonathan's us station cherry point north carolina did absolutely deploy to laser strike this is a fact i find it odd wegan would not have deployed with the other mac g28 marines for perimeter defense and low altitude aerial defense to replace the obsolete hawk batteries similar to hit pieces on david grush i also have a tremendous issue when claims of witnesses or whistleblowers are dismissed because of quote unquote health conditions jonathan has been playing this incident affected his life extremely negatively from the violent interrogation to feeling like non-human beings were calling out for his help in the craft wreckage jonathan did not leave this incident unscathed in the slightest i must interject my own personal biases here but i am close friends with mr wegan the man enjoys a successful career and relationships with friends family and loved ones as far as i can tell the man does not suffer from fanciful delusions to construct such a specific fantasy since the witness testimony of jake barber the concept of egg shaped ufo retrievals has grown significantly in popularity while wegan described a much larger more intricate craft with hatches a band of light along its circumference and what seems similar to gills over barber's suv side smooth white egg we can find multiple retrieval cases from history that share numerous similarities to the alleged crash in peru in 1997 let's reference the work done by legendary ufo crash retrieval researcher lenard stringfield and visit ufo crash retrieval status report three between 1980 and 1982 stringfield became aware of one hj a sergeant in the us army 24th infantry who was wounded during service in the korean war in july of 1953 whilst a private and b company at camp poke louisiana a 17-year-old private hj and his unit under command of one sergeant rs were performing duty maneuvers at dusk at roughly 7 p.m. hj's platoon observed an object that was egg shaped crash land out in the boondocks according to hj authorities as well as a and b companies were ordered out to the crash site at the site hj got within 15 yards of the object before a lieutenant witting ordered company b to withdraw to 100 yards stating quote unquote peons like hj quote had to get out of the way and quote interestingly enough we can place an actual lieutenant witting at camp poke at this time the area around the craft was badly burned turning nearby ground into a powdery substance like crushed brick and hj could still feel heat emanating from the vehicle the craft was as wide as a three bedroom single story ranch house which by modern standard estimates could be anywhere between 35 to 70 feet similarities here exist to wagons craft estimates of 20 meters or roughly 66 feet the large ovoid object was without windows or lights and quote was surrounded by a fin like protrusion on its equator which was still rotating end quote another close similarity to wagons and discussion of a band of light traveling across the craft circumference shortly after securing the site a special detachment medics an ambulance and special equipment arrived on scene this detachment approached an open hatch on the side of the craft after a while two medics carried away a stretcher to the ambulance containing a body three occupants of the craft then emerged and were aided by medics seemingly injured hj would state quote one of them kept looking at the one in the litter and made strange noises i couldn't believe what i was seen end quote as incredible as this detail is we have discussed similar testimony before remember back to the infographic show whistleblower testimony of a crash retrieval operator i put a lot of stock into the witness in this program claimed in several ufo retrieval operations in which craft were manned by biologics retrieval teams would often have to lead occupants out of the craft these biologics were described seemingly as limited in cognitive ability possibly giving some credence to the theory some ufo occupants are akin to biological androids that perform basic or specific functions that night the two live ones apparently just kind of stood there as the team entered the craft it had opened on its own maybe they opened the door i don't know if it was open when we got there they stood there and they didn't answer the ambassador at all basically they just barely reacted to anything just basic stimuli like turning their heads away from bright lights they didn't even object when the medical team started looking them over for injuries or so i was told i saw them when they were led out of the craft and i do mean they were let out like children the medical guys grabbed them by the hand and just let them out like a kid they just sort of stood where you left them hj described these occupants as three and a half to four feet tall of slight build and walked as if they had no knees or very stiff bending only at the hips hj described large heads without features leading him to believe the creatures were covered by a helmet the biologics were a tight fitting dull metallic green uniform later on hj would somehow learn that these biologics were sent to a hospital and quote unquote put into isolation but all died in captivity he also learned the corpses were sent over to a medical center near washington dc this could of course perhaps be the army's fort detrick roughly 40 miles away from dc at fort detrick betel memorial institute manages the national biodefense analysis and countermeasures center ffr dc i have previously implicated fort detrick alongside utah's dugway proving ground in holding ufo biologics i highly recommend checking out my video on dugway to learn more hj's experience at fort polk shares striking similarities to wagant but let's go even further let's now jump to stringfield's 1991 ufo crash retrievals the inner sanctum status reports six and investigate the case of barnabas aka albert bruce collins much of stringfield's work here came from ufo researcher tim cooper one of the primary researchers who received significant drops of majestic 12 documents in the 1980s also recall from my majestic 12 project with author ryan wood how tim cooper's father usaff master sergeant harry b cooper received a special citation from the legendary general entwined in ufo lore courtesy lemay this letter to tim cooper's father from lemay praised harry b cooper for his work on the quote unquote usaff ufo program anyways cooper interviewed barnabas aka albert bruce collins shortly before his 1990 new year's eve death on 20 november 1990 collins claimed to be a metallurgical engineer and retired government employee specifically developing metal alloys used for electromagnetic propagation and magnetic field propulsion from 1942 to the late 1950s and it is important to note i can't necessarily confirm collins claims of an accomplished metallurgical engineering career while collins did in fact die on 30 december 1990 all i can confirm from his obituary is he was a veteran a member of the nra in a nature conservancy collins disclosed to cooper in 1947 he observed a ufo on a long flatbed trailer covered with a green tarp being backed into a large warehouse at the university of california berkeley i'm immediately reminded of us army lowboy trucks described in numerous ufo retrieval cases such as the 1953 kingman crash and the 1965 kexburg pennsylvania crash according to collins he stood but just 100 feet away from an oval-shaped craft described like an egg with the shell cracked and the yoke still inside the craft was metallic similar to polished aluminum with a silvery looking finish similar to wagant's case this egg featured a seam at the edge all the way around collins guessed this craft suffered an internal explosion with the metal exterior of the craft seemingly pushed out the retrieval had sustained significant amounts of damage with a large section ripped off in a huge gash on top running down the side below the seam from his 100 foot away vantage point collins observed a bulkhead in front with multi-layered honeycomb skin the interior was dark but similar to the egg analogy there was a shiny sphere in the center of the craft surrounded by another bulkhead the craft additionally featured a forward compartment but collins could not see inside the vehicle was 30 to 40 feet in diameter and roughly 15 feet high these dimensions are slightly smaller than the craft wagant described but why even mention this short story of collins with no supporting documentation or even verification of his work history as a metallurgical engineer well this is because in his 1990 interview with tim cooper collins additionally disclose some information that may just raise your eyebrow not only did collins claim to have studied metal of unknown composition and origin in an official capacity but also claimed at this time 1949 he learned of a multitude of agencies involved in tuo or technologies of unknown origin research this included intelligence offices from the u.s. army air force and navy the cia the rand corporation founded just one year prior in 1948 and the vatican collins even claimed to have learned of multiple projects between these agencies archangel between the cia rand and vatican black book under the air force the infamous blue book under the air force white book between the cia and vatican and yellow book which served as a scientific panel of an unknown government scientific review board while discussing these projects collins added he had heard los alamos national labs had been studying green fireballs and strange debris found in the desert and this last piece of data is what lends credence to some of collins words as the atomic energy commission did indeed create a project twinkle in the late 40s and early 50s that analyzed ufo's including green fireballs at los alamos sandia white sands and hauleman air force base of course this isn't our topic for today but these joint projects with the vatican are highly interesting i have covered this case before but let's briefly circle back to the 1933 magenta italy ufo crash retrieval case according to the case as well as david grush in the late herald malmgren vatican intelligence alerted the united states of the lenticular disk in axis possession this in turn allowed the us to capture this ufo saucer post world war two it's incredible to then consider joint u.s vatican ufo programs that followed world war two collins is quite the enigma and possibly in the future we will return to analyze further claims of his included knowledge in project arc angel that determined some ufo occupants were biological extraterrestrials there are many cases of egg shaped or tear drop shaped ufo retrieval operations we just don't have the time to cover today i would also like to point to the 1973 great lake naval base rk testimony i covered in my previous naval ufo legacy programs project in which gunnery school instructor rk observed a 30 foot long and 10 foot high tear drop shaped ufo resting on a wooden platform in a quonset style hangar in the great lakes naval station illinois this craft was allegedly shot down via a naval destroyer and picked up in the pacific ocean by the national underwater reconnaissance officers glomar explorer hey guys it's grub and i'd like to thank each and every single one of you for joining me on this very special investigation into lance corporal jonathan wagan now those of you new to my videos will now know one this is an ai and two this is where after the video i kind of do an off script kind of rant if you want to call it and give my thoughts on the video give my thoughts on the investigation and kind of summarize everything we've talked about returning viewers of this channel will probably know this is a very special video as one of my first ever projects was on jonathan wagan but of course at that time i didn't know jonathan i didn't have a relationship with him nor did i have the investigative skills the video editing skills the research skills the writing skills to craft such a project now originally the plan here was just to do an interview with wagan and so after many months of knowing him and forming a friendship i went out to where he resides i'm not going to go ahead and spill that but it's in the south as you can probably tell from his accent some of the other accents we heard and i was fortunate enough to have my friend kermit uh frog and badger i've had him on a live before right after the november 14 2024 hearings he was able to meet me out there and help film and so forth so i want to give a huge shout out to him guys he's a great friend of this channel i'd like to have him on some more lives uh he just on the drop of a pencil decided to come up and help so huge shout out but this originally was planned to just be an interview with wagan and as he and i started talking and as i started to sit with some of our conversations i thought well maybe let's break this down a little bit and do a two-part series first wagan back in 2000 gave so much information really actionable information down to the does team due to names and you guys know on this channel how much we love when names are given and in 2023 he offered little new information so i thought why don't jonathan and i sit down and really iron out some of the finer details of what he remembers because guys time is slipping away this incident occurred according to jonathan in 1997 so we're pushing on 30 years here but i wanted to get some of those details out and work out an investigation and then sit down and do an interview with jonathan you guys know how i work i really want the firm foundation laid out before he and i sit down and talk so i do plan on returning with him and kind of getting a more relaxed interview style of him just speaking about his life speaking about his life before and after and so forth so that's going to be coming down the pipeline but this project i thought it pertinent to to start digging into some of the details with jonathan and then be able to do my own research and exploration some of these added details included jonathan describing that the men in black kames where they're on site first that was a huge question i had going into this whether uh to kind of ponder if that team arrived on the ch-47s with the doe nest probably team or that they had arrived first now the fact they arrived first according to jonathan gives even more credence to these were local special forces now of course he didn't describe team any vehicles but in my opinion the seventh army green berets probably utilized humbies or nearby vehicles to arrive on scene first another key point here was the multinational group that these germans these chinese they were all armed now that is a massive detail as well and one that i'm still trying to to solve here because of course we've heard of multinational recovery team specifically with five eyes nations and canadian politician larry maguire kind of writing to his own minister of defense in canada saying we need to get information about uap because of five eyes projects and maybe retrieval teams and another huge detail he talked about was him thinking the men in black camis were army due to the helmets they had now if you're unfamiliar with military various factions of military army marines navy all of their infantry and soldiers utilize different helmets so being able to track down the helmets or kind of the caps they had wagon thought these guys were army and that's a huge detail to to try and track down i also really enjoyed him talking about mop gear and varying levels of that and that gives even more credence to me for the nest team varying levels of protection versus how close and proximity these men would get to the craft now jonathan's testimony is of course truly startling one of the big questions remains now is what happened to the craft after and jonathan and i talked about this i i decided not to include it here because it's it's speculation with very little basis here but that that's a very interesting question to me this craft was lodged into a granite cliff face almost how was it taken out how was it retrieved because if we're talking about c47s and the night stockers sure they may have airlifted some kind of picked apart soviet helicopters before but how do you get a craft of non-human origin a massive one and what are some of the logistics here where the biologics taken out first was the rest of the liquid contains and then taken out and what went on here and i do think one of the interesting parts of this story is the liquid now as we dug into it jonathan and myself he kind of theorized that you know maybe this liquid wasn't just a fuel a propulsion system but he thought because some liquid was coming out of the recessed hole the hatch that was open where he saw the biologic hanging out that water was coming from there that this craft may have been filled with water and that brings up the question what if the species he encountered were almost an aquatic species that lived in the water and the craft contained almost an aquarium or a closed system of water of sorts i think these questions are highly interesting to ponder i think one of the most fruitful and frustrating avenues of this research was reaching out to the fellow marines adkins alan and montaligre total i probably reached out to 10 people connected with laser strike only one responded to me and that was one of the marines that wagant claimed he was with now it is important to note here all three of those marines montaligre alan and adkins all went career usmc they all retired enlisted but it retired with very prestigious positions in marines i'm not saying there's a connection there but it is interesting to see that jonathan kind of got made an example of and left the marines in 98 admitted to using controlled substances so he could get out of the marines but these other guys enjoyed very long careers now the one that responded to me again i'm not going to burn his name just because i you know unlike brad s in the flux liner he hasn't sent me death threats so i'm not going to burn his name or post any sort of screenshots of messages but i was a little displeased with how he treated jonathan i said in the video and i'll say it again i i don't think that whistleblower testimony should be kind of boiled down to saying that the witness just has mental issues i've seen it before i'm sure we'll see it again this reminds me to the team leader of michael herera nathan who just said that michael was crazy because he enjoyed lifting weights and spending time alone whilst deployed and i find arguments like that to be to not have much in him now i would always find it weird when contacting this marine most of his story would go just towards the impossibility of usmc having hawk batteries improved at that time and i agree with that jonathan agrees with that but he always said no the story's false the story can't be true because we didn't have hawk batteries the lance corporal story is false so that's kind of a mute point to me but i also think it's strange he said that jonathan never deployed to puculpa or to laser strike when mac g 28 marines very well indeed according to our laser strike documentation did deploy so that's a bit of a curious point now of course i try and be as objective as i can in my videos but in the end of my videos i tend to give my opinion guys i i do believe the encounter of jonathan wagan and i believe it for a couple reasons not just talking to jonathan but talking to kind of people not connected with this i i do have conviction that this case is is real i think it's one of the most extraordinary encounters of a downed ufo craft of all time that being said there's still mysteries here with this case of course time slipping away so jonathan is remembering fewer and fewer details i commend him for being able to say when he doesn't remember because this was 30 years ago and as impactful as such an event would be there are going to be things he can't quite remember like insignias on people's uniforms or tiny little details of the makeup of notches on a craft or the digits on an arm hanging out these things i don't blame him for being able to recall and i commend him for saying i'm speculating here or i don't recall when he doesn't know something but i i do think this is a a case that did occur what happened to the craft we could only guess did it get taken to the office of naval research because i suspect namru the naval because i suspect namru south had some sort of implications here was their transfer of materials or liquid up to namru up in bright paterson who knows now that being said my theory of of namru and my theory of iqitos and my theory of the seventh this does still need work i think it's a strong thesis but of course we can't concrete prove this the biggest take up here is of course namru being the location where wagon was held versus him not receiving any medical treatment i do think this interesting that the doe personnel probably nest you know i i think at this point it's almost a mute point to sit to try and argue that it's not nest but he was stripped of his clothes clearly his clothes were taken off as soon as he encountered the liquid when he was beaten by the other marines separated from adkins and allen who knows what happened to them who knows what happened to the seven plus other marines that were not in the vanguard that may have seen the craft that may have not made it down the ridge wagon doesn't know and he was put into isolation threatened and so on so i think because he took a swing at one of these men he was both made an example of and because he encountered the liquid there was a contamination threat but he didn't receive medical procedures is this a substance that the doe nest team and retrieval teams are familiar with and maybe it's just like a slightly acidic goopy water with the consistency of syrup so they weren't really worried but they wanted to get those clothes off and maybe but that's all just speculation so is namer but i do think that kind of fits the bill for a marine that came into contact with a non-human fluid get him isolated but again he said this location was underground perhaps namer has underground facilities perhaps this was nearby and i do think it's interesting he was driven back to his base now i need to get in contact with somebody else stationed at raider detachment five which i really have tried to see if there were a mac g 28 marines there because this would really solve quite a bit of this but i do think it's interesting with the mar forlant training team and the special forces there and all of the history of special forces whether that be the first one 228th aviation regiment or the seven special forces up there in northern peru in history now of course this retrieval team could be a dedicated j-soc or former j-soc or so-called retrieval team that station in south america maybe howard air force base and panama maybe somewhere else to react to these this would fit in our time frame of retrieval too because i know i gave about nine hours it could be plus or minus an hour even to that i have a lot of air here they could be stationed for south american retrievals we just don't know i'm just trying to work with the best available evidence we have and try and reconstruct the testimony so of course in my theory there's a lot of assumptions there and i was the first to say that there's a lot of assumptions and if you have a competing theory of how this played out please let me know i'd love to hear it because at the end of the day i'm just trying to take some of the pieces of evidence and fit them into a theory and i do think it's strong but it is open to interpretation and probably open to error so if you have something better there or something you think is stronger let me know i'd love to talk more about this case speaking of let me know what you guys think in the comments because i know so many people have wanted to hear more from weigand and i'm thrilled this has some exclusive conversations with him for the first time really in since 2000 because on the martin willis show he he didn't really shed new light on any details um i almost got the sense he didn't quite want to be there so i was really glad weigand and i could form a friendship and then kind of sit down on camera together and he was really nervous about being on camera he doesn't like it he's a very different person on camera versus not on camera it makes him very uncomfortable he's a very private guy always has been he was very animated in 2000 and he just it took him a lot to get over the fear of going on camera then took him a lot of fear going on camera in 2023 and now so with that being said guys this is about the time i tell everybody of course i do have a patreon i don't gatekeep any content there's no extra content on there i don't have time to make extra content everything i make is open source and will always be freely available i will never gatekeep research i will never gatekeep projects so if you want to support the channel just support what you think the channel is worth what doesn't cost you money is to like and subscribe please do that leave a comment that helps the channel out tremendously these investigations take quite a while as as we found out here with about a week extra over my normal

Throughout American and world history, there are numerous encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails and witnesses. And sometimes, these trails get messy. Details, records, and facts of one case may be confused with another, making it difficult to fully analyze the stories of these fascinating retrieval efforts. This is especially true for two cases along the arid desert border of Texas and Mexico. What's up guys, it's UAP GERP. Thank you so much for joining me today as we are going to cover a region of Texas near the Texas-Mexico border named Del Rio that experienced not one, but two alleged UFO crash and recovery operations during the 1950s. Over the years, these two cases have almost molded into one, but due to their insanely interesting stories and astonishing connections to ufology, each deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens. Are these cases fact or fiction? Join me today as we investigate to find out. In June of 2018, Dr. Eric Davis was interviewed by journalist George Knapp on Coast to Coast AM. And yes, this is the same Eric Davis from the Wilson Davis memo whose scientific pedigree cannot be understated. When the two legends of ufology begin discussing UFO reverse engineering efforts, the doctor states, quote, Yeah, they've got, I would say, you know, if you're going to throw your bets on Roswell, your bets really good. Del Rio, Texas, that was a 1950s case. That was another one. And the other ones I won't bring up because those are still classified. Researching the highly disputed MJ 12 documents leads us to another clue surrounding the Texas-Mexico border. Following the description of the Roswell case in the Eisenhower briefing document, the alleged MJ 12 document to brief the president incumbent highlights a case from the 6th of December 1950. This case saw a UFO of similar origin to Roswell impact the earth at high speeds along the El Indio area of the Texas-Mexico border. The craft impacted at such high speeds, it was nearly obliterated when the search team arrived. The recovered materials were transported to the atomic energy commission facility at Sandia, New Mexico for study. Okay, pretty cut and dry, right? El Indio is 75 miles southeast of Del Rio. So it makes sense to use this as a reference point, right? But there is another case that occurred in 1955 that researchers additionally use the Del Rio area as a reference point. The Colonel Robert Willingham crash retrieval case near Langtree, Texas. There are a number of huge factors separating these cases we will cover later in the video. But lack of study of these two cases has led to egregious misidentification between the two. So let's take a step back and analyze each case. Colonel Robert Burton Willingham served honorably in World War II in Korea. His distinguished career saw him within the US Army, Air Force, Air Force Reserves, and civilian air patrol. Serving in the US Air Force during Korea, Willingham claims to have received a purple heart for his severe wounds suffered to his leg and head when hit by a mortar shell and a foxhole. I use the word claims here very deliberately because I have not been able to verify any receiving of his purple heart. Now it is worth mentioning there are some respected ufologists like Kevin Randall in his book Crash where UFOs fall from the sky who doubt or call into question Willingham's Air Force service record. And this is because the National Personal Record Service in St. Louis, Missouri was unable to provide his service record. However, what is worthy to note on July 12, 1973, there was a fire in this building that destroyed most military records for personnel serving between 1947 and 1963. Now the author Noah Torres has stated he has over 50 documents to prove Willingham's Air Force service, but I have yet to see these documents. These injuries saw Willingham unable to return to combat, where he then returned to Texas as an Air Force Reserve pilot. On a spring day in 1955, the Colonel and Reserves were running a Cold War simulation mission where Willingham and other F-86 aviators assisted B-47 and B-52 bombers. It is on this mission, Robert claims to have experienced a crashed UAP. Before we get started, I would like to immediately cite my primary sources and discuss the history of Willingham coming public. I will primarily be pulling from the 2008 book The Other Roswell UFO Crash on the Texas Border written by Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte due to the author's personal work and interviews with Robert near the end of his life in 2015. Robert first went public with his story in 1965, featured in a Pennsylvania weekly newspaper called Mechanicsburg. An article asking civilian air patrol pilots about UFO counters first oversaw the Colonel's story. 12 years later, researchers found clippings of this article in the NICAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon, lost in the annals of NICAP's files. Researcher Todd Zechel tracked down Willingham and made him sign an affidavit. And I do have to point out the inaccuracies between this article and the affidavit versus the other Roswell book I am referencing. In this article from 67 and affidavit from 77, Willingham states he was flying in F-94. He goes on to say in the other Roswell book he was actually flying an F-86 Sabre. In the article, he claims his experience happened in 1948, but in the book and other sources, Willingham claims to have seen the UFO in 1955. This he blames on a faulty memory due to the head injury he sustained in Korea, but this to me does in fact hurt Willingham's credibility. On a spring day in 1955, the Colonel and other F-86 aviators escorted B-47s for a Cold War simulation training exercise from the Carswell AFB. It's worth noting Willingham's serial number and call sign CD195 and Willie Eddy. The missions served to escort the bombers in their Texas leg of their New York to Texas to Washington state journey. Willingham stated the squadron had received intelligence by radio that fast-moving unidentified signatures had been picked up by the distant early warning radar systems, dues, located in Canada. These signatures were moving south towards Texas. During the mission, the pilot of the B-47 radioed in about an unknown aircraft picked up on radar moving south from the northwest. Willingham then saw a bright big object like a star coming his way. The object approached within 35 to 40 miles of the USF regiment at an estimated speed of 2,000 miles per hour. This was an estimate by Willingham because the craft seemed to go four times the speed of its F-86, which traveled at 685 miles per hour. Willingham described the brightly lit surface, quote, like magnesium steel. Other pilots, including George Smithson, stated they had also seen the craft in a post-incident debrief. The object made a 90-degree turn headed southwest towards the Mexican border. Shortly after the turn, the object was seen to emit, quote, a lot of sparks, and it tilted down at about a 45-degree angle. The colonel wondered if this was due to the abrupt turning maneuver causing hull damage. The object fell out of view and the colonel assumed it had crash-landed just west of Del Rio. Now quickly, there is no report of this sighting in 1955. However, we can look to the Condon Report I spoke of in my stigma video, which was created specifically to push the UFO stigma. Case 5 of the report lists a military UFO encounter from 19 September 1957, also from Carzwell Air Force Base in Fort Worth. In this recorded encounter, a large bright fireball alternating red to white chased a USAF RB-47 for more than 600 miles. The object was seen by flight crew, detected by Carzwell radar, and picked up by the RB-47's radar. Interestingly, the equipment for electronic countermeasures and reconnaissance aboard the RB-47 registered the UFO emanating a strong radar signal of 2800 megacycles. Quoted from the Condon Report from pilot Louis D. Chase, quote, Before any evasive action could be taken, the light crossed in front of the plane, moving to the right at a velocity far higher than airplane speeds. The light was seen by pilot and co-pilot and appeared to the pilot to be a glowing body as big as a barn, end quote. The Condon Report shockingly detailed how the ECM, graphic, and radar data were all removed upon landing by intelligence personnel. Onscreen now is the original CIA report of this incident. Anyways, back to Willingham. Familiar with the area, Robert estimated the crash to be in Langtree, Texas. He radio Denver flight controller, requesting permission to fly to the estimated crash site. Denver replied, quote, Yes, go check out what it was and where it hit. We want to know where it was, too, end quote. Willingham approached Langtree from San Angelo and brought his F-86 down to an altitude of near 800 feet. It was here he observed the wreckage of a disc-shaped craft, which collided with the ground just south of the Rio Grande on the Mexican side of the border. The craft had seemingly collided and skidded 300 feet across the ground. The colonel returned to mission and formulated a plan to visit the site privately when he returned to base. The colonel arrived to Corsicana Airfield, met his friend, and prepared to depart to the wreckage in a 1947 Erronka Champion. Willingham's friend slipped under the radar and faced no reprisals for this incident. His name was later revealed after his death in 2002, as Jack Perkins, a Pennsylvania electronics engineer who served in the Civil Air Patrol with Robert. Before we go on to the crash, there may be just a little more to Willingham's story than meets the eye. This unclassified document from the 18th of July, 1955, just months after Willingham's encounter, details a response request from USAF Captain Ladi Marin to a request from the commander of USAF Security Services in San Antonio. The commander was requesting for data on UFO sightings from NEAC, the Northeast Air Command, and Northwestern United States specifically from B-47 jets. This could very well be coincidence, but it is interesting how a USAF commander in San Antonio of all places was interested in B-47 UFO encounters right after Robert's sighting. And we do have another very relevant case from spring the year before Willingham's encounter, 1954. On May 14, 1954, a flight of marine reserve jets led by Major Charles Scarborough flew about six miles west of Dallas, Texas. The team spotted 16 unidentified signatures in groups of four. Pilot Scarborough and Jorgensen attempted to box these UFOs alternating between white to orange, similar to our other two cases. The signatures accelerated away rapidly at high speeds evading the Marines. Perkins and Willingham reached the crash area at about 4 p.m. The object had broken off into roughly three sections with debris strewn everywhere. The object appeared to be dome-shaped, 12 to 15 feet in length, resting 50 feet beyond the main body of the UFO. The main body appeared to be a flattened disc, 20 to 25 feet in diameter, split into two larger pieces. Half the disc was embedded into a sandy mound. While touching down, the two noticed Mexican soldiers, jeeps, and cars formed in a perimeter around the crash site. The two men approached the site and observed many pieces of debris, quote, there were lots of pieces of debris, some little and some large chunks about as big as a good sofa chair. Willingham noted the Mexicans were not attempting material gathering or retrieval effort of any kind. No trucks or airplanes were at the scene. The soldiers appeared to be simply standing perimeter on the site. After touching down quite a distance from the wreckage, Mexican soldiers approached the two men. One of these, an officer named Lieutenant Martinez from Mexico City, noted Willingham's use half fatigues and offered to take him near the site. But without Perkins, Martinez told Robert, we can't let anyone close to it. The American Air Force will be here very soon to clean this all up. Now, Willingham assumed the military men were from the closest army base, Ciudad Acuna, around 100 miles away. I have not been able to track down any record of a Lieutenant Martinez here. But according to Willingham's story, the Mexican government was simply guarding the wreckage for an American crash retrieval team to show up. This is a process claimed that pops up relatively often, such as the 1978 Bolivia crash retrieval I talked about in my Moondust video, which saw Bolivian authorities alerting American military to inspect the downed UFO. When departing the wreckage, Willingham decided he would not leave without evidence of the crash, so he grabbed a small piece of shiny metal debris. Upon returning to base, Willingham submitted an oral and written report to Reserve Commander Colonel Miller and soon received threats not to discuss his sightings, warning of consequences. One General in USAF Intelligence told him, quote, Don't say anything about what you saw down on the border. The material Willingham possessed was rigid, unyielding, but extremely light, and grayish silver in color. It reminded him of magnesium steel, small honeycomb patterned holes lined the side, which the Colonel figured was to dissipate heat. There was no inscription, symbols, or characters on it, unlike the Roswell material. This material shares little resemblance to the shape memory alloy found at Roswell and likely studied by Battelle Memorial Institute. Willingham tried to test the piece's material properties through a series of deformation tests, including torch cutting, all to no avail. According to Willingham, he possessed the material for four days, but in his haste to study the material took no images. The Colonel sent the fragment to USMC Metallurgy Lab in Hagerstown, Maryland. A USMC major received the material and was perplexed by the structure. Willingham gave him his number and address to receive the piece back. Some time later, Willingham contacted the lab to talk to the major. He was told no such person had worked there, nor did they know anything about this mysterious metal. There were no records of tests. He attempted to pursue the chain of command, but was told it would be in his best interest not to pursue the matter further. While Willingham's story may be suspect here regarding the materials, what is undeniable is the fact USG did in fact partake in the study of UFO materials. Even if you discount the Battelle-Roswell connection, we can analyze Project Moondust, tasked with recovering foreign space vehicles and UFOs, or the 1966 CIA memo titled, Exploitation of Metallic Fragment from Unidentified Flying Object, which discusses material from a fallen UFO recovered in the Congo. Now, this is one of the most troubling aspects of this case for me. In the other Roswell, there is a specific chapter on alien bodies. No mention of NHI is made here, quote, I never saw bodies. I was not able to get close enough and I don't know what happened after I left, end quote. Willingham reasons the most likely place for bodies, if there were any, would be under the dome shaped section of the craft. However, on a July 24th, 2012 interview with Jeff Rents, Willingham specifically states he saw bodies. Yeah. Okay, so the front of the craft that impacted the ground ripped a hole open inside and apparently people could see in there and there were dead ETs or they weren't humans, there were dead bodies in there of some kind. Right, right. And you couldn't get around there to see in there either. Well, I kind of snuck around. You're a sneaky fella, aren't you? All right, now tell you snuck around there a little bit, Colonel. What did you see? Well, it didn't look like human beings to me. How many of them were there? I believe there were three and the lieutenant said there were four. All right. I never did see the other one. Were the bodies mangled or were they relatively intact and what were they dressed in? Well, they weren't dressed at all. Okay. And they were in a lot of different pieces. I didn't see but one that had a complete top. But I wouldn't swear what he was eating. All right. What did the head look like? Anything like we've seen in the common research literature, the big eyes, the smooth skin or the little mouth. Did you see anything? Yeah, some of them that looked like that. They just, I don't know how you explain it, but they just, their heads and arms and stuff, their arms are a little bitty. They look like boomsticks. Well, okay. But they had a big room stick. All right. No, no, I got you. They had no uniform on. They were just basically skin if that's what their outer covering is. The point of bodies is reiterated in the 2023 presentation given by author of the book, Noah Torres, who additionally mentions bodies. Was this poor reporting in the book? I don't think so because Willingham is specifically quoted as not seeing bodies. I will absolutely not fall back in an argument that Willingham's memory in old age was failing him, causing him to remember details poorly. This is the argument he uses as to why some small inaccuracies exist in his affidavit, like the type of plane he was flying. I have reached out to Noah Torres for more comment on the bodies because as of now, this is a massive issue in Willingham's credibility. We do have an independent witness who can bring some interesting details to this case, former USAF member William Drager. Drager first appears in Leonard Stringfield's UFO crash retrievals reports in an entry titled Del Rio, Texas 1950. Here is another case of conflicting dates with our two cases. While this entry lists 1950, Drager clearly discusses Willingham's case. Drager, fluent in Spanish, was hired as an interpreter for a Japanese documentary discussing a UFO crash involving a colonel near the Mexican border. I have not been able to find this documentary, but I have seen screenshots from it in Noah Torres' book. In an affidavit provided, Drager details how he contacted a Mexican general who commanded that area of the border. Drager explains the case of the general and the general stated quote, yes, I know about that. I don't have any papers or documents to prove it, but due to my position, I know about that end quote. Drager, Willingham and the film crew met with the general who on camera denied and evaded any questions dealing with the incident and UFOs. According to Drager, this man was beyond reproach and a quote unquote military celebrity in Mexico. Before we get into the 1950 L Indio case listed in the Eisenhower Briefing MJ12 document, how can we concretely say these two incidents are not the same? Well, for starters, the memo describes the crashed object as totally incinerated, while Willingham's case describes three major pieces of wreckage. Two, the 1950 cases listed as occurring on December 6th, 1950. Willingham served in Korea until his injury, which occurred on December 26th, 1950. And three, the 1950 cases stated as occurring 75 miles south of Del Rio between El Indio and Guerrero. The Langstree location is 60 miles northwest of Del Rio. And finally point four, Willingham's case describes use of distant early warning or due systems. These were not implemented until 1952, so impossible to be associated with the 1950 case. So what exactly can we find out about this 1950 crash? From our alleged 1952 MJ12 memo, we observe a craft almost incinerated, recovered between El Indio, Texas, and Guerrero, Mexico. The wreckage is then sent to the Atomic Energy Commission's Sandia facility. And unfortunately, there really isn't too much to be found out about this case. I can reference a 1995 Omni Magazine article titled Crash at El Indio, alleged UFO crash in Mexico by Dennis Stacey. Stacey had conducted a mission from 1990 to 94 to decipher the crashed location and determine whether the story mentioned in the document was real or a hoax. Stacey found a town resident, Sr. Flores, who actually witnessed the event, quote, he had been working on his family's land north of town, north of the river in El Indio, when a ball of fire fell from the sky, crashing on the adjoining ranch and igniting a grass fire. A day or two later, a military contingent arrived from Pitas Negras, blocking off the location and hauled something away by truck. Flores was not aware if the military vehicles were Mexican, American, or a mix and had no idea if the wreckage was hauled away. Stacey thinks that possibly, but without confirmation, this could be describing a case of a civil air patrol plane crash that occurred on January 16, 1944. But this date, January 6, 1950, is a key date. On this day, a nationwide US alert was called at 1030 a.m. Eastern time regarding, quote, large number of unidentified aircraft approaching northeastern US at high altitude. Defense command is taking action to dispatch interceptors. No reason to believe they are friendly, end quote. Within the document, an estimated 40 signatures were spotted at 32,000 feet. Funny enough, General Raimi, yes, the same general from Roswell canceled this alert at 1316 hours. Interestingly enough, December 8, 1950, then sees a confidential memo directed to J. Edgar Hoover regarding flying saucers and how Army intelligence has been put on high alert for any data whatsoever on these flying discs. So while we really can't find any factual data on this L-Indio crash, we can find nationwide alert regarding UFOs at the same time. Does this FBI memo have to do with the Air Force Unidentified Craft Alert, or possibly a crash retrieval? We do know from the Guy Hoddle memo sent later this year, the FBI was in fact discussing crash retrievals and bodies. Apparently, UFO researcher Todd Zechel, yes, the same from Willingham's case, obtained a declassified USF document stating the military had recovered a foreign object on December 6 or 7 of 1950 and transported it back to Carswell AFB. But this unwillingness to provide any shred of proof of this document means we cannot consider this part of the case. So remember how the MJ-12 document mentions the debris was taken to Sandia Labs and into the hands of the AEC? Well, here's where things get interesting. We all know in the 2024 NDAA, the AEC was historically used to misclassify and obfuscate UFO information and likely more materials, legacy programs, etc. But Sandia Labs sits on the property of Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. In 1949, President Truman handed over managerial responsibilities of Sandia to AT&amp;T, yes, the phone company, the same one that made the transistor in the 1940s. Well, if we look at Stephen Greer's document archive of his disclosure project witness list, we can find two examples of redacted names, protected witnesses involving AT&amp;T and NHI. One entry states, quote, witness from ACC with knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&amp;T, end quote, in the private industrial sector. Another which states, quote, President of Blank, knowledge of ET technology transfer to AT&amp;T, he has been on radio sighting show, may have useful pseudonyms knows about the ET technology transfer program, end quote. And Kirtland itself along with Sandia has been forever intertwined with UFO lore. So this is extremely interesting how at the time of this alleged retrieval, Sandia managed by AT&amp;T under Kirtland Air Force Base received this ET technology and Greer has multiple witnesses who comment on some sort of ET or NHI technology transfer to the company who knows maybe AT&amp;T is one of our early suspects for UFOs in the private sector. I mean, after all, let's look back to my Lockheed Martin video to the claims of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar A. Fouch, who stated that Lockheed had reverse engineered the now infamous TR3B. He stated that part of this reverse engineering UAP program came from Sandia Labs. Remember AT&amp;T managed Sandia until 1993 when it was taken over by you guessed it Lockheed Martin. So there's a lot more to investigate here and maybe a little bit more truth to this 1950 crash than meets the eye. Hey guys, thank you so much for watching and joining me as I investigated these 1950s Del Rio, Texas UFO crashes. When I started this investigation, I was just expecting to cover one case 1950. From everything I had read, I thought that Willingham story, the MJ 12 document, William Drager and so forth all covered one event. So when I read the book, the other Roswell by Noah Torres, which I highly recommended became clear that we were talking about two separate instances. I would like to know what you guys think especially about Willingham. I am eagerly awaiting the author to get back in touch with me because, at least to me, the body's claims, the conflicting claims are a huge red flag, massive. And I can't really consider this story as anything more than just a story until I have those details ironed out. It is already enough of a problem to me that Willingham changed small details on his affidavit. Sure, they might be small such as the aircraft he was flying in the year. However, these are still very important things to get right because if these details are wrong, the affidavit is pretty much null and void. It's kind of disappointing especially that he relies on head injuries in Korea to say there's these problems with his memories. But, you know, maybe I'll be able to find out a little more and give an update. I think the December 6 1950 crash is really interesting even though we don't have much details because that MJ 12 document and I made a post about this in community and I'll say it again. I think the MJ 12 documents combine a lot of disinformation and factual information similar to what Stanton Freeman claims. And to me, the context of this crash is super interesting, especially with Sandia Labs, Kirtland, the AEC, just all sorts of delicious puzzle pieces that kind of hook together and kind of weave into what we already think about when we already think of crash retrievals. I promise you guys that next episode is another whistleblowers video volume two. I got plenty of those. I got plenty of ideas, trust me. There's like a dozen, two dozen other crash retrievals I also want to cover and we'll get to them in time. I thank everyone so much for watching today. Please remember to like and subscribe and hey, if you think the channel is worth a little bit of cash, feel free to join that Patreon. I'm not going to keep gatekeep any of my content, only support what you think the channel is worth. And I'd like to get a thought from you guys. We're approaching 5000 subscribers. At 5000, I still wanted to do a video explaining the origins and taxonomy of NHI that was a deleted slide in Carl Nell Soul Foundation presentation. So if you guys want to see that, let me know. If everyone just wants more research, that's totally fine too. I love making these videos. It doesn't matter what I make. I just want to research. I want to put stuff out there that I think is worth talking about and discussing. So you let me know what you guys want and please in the comments let me know what you thought of these cases. I really want to know what you guys think about Willingham. Am I being too harsh here? I don't think I am. I think I'm just kind of weighing the facts. This case is a little different to some others like Roswell. Roswell of course is our best documented crash with all the affidavit signed and all the witnesses and even something like Kingman with Arthur Stansel. Sure, we have about one affidavit as well to describe that story with some connecting things like Dr. Ed Dahl and Eric Wang and so forth. But the fact of the matter is with Stansel, we don't have details in his affidavit that change. So I think Willingham's story, while fascinating, has a lot less credibility, but there is a lot of context around his citing that is pretty interesting, such as other B-47 signings. So thank you guys. Appreciate it and I will catch everybody on the next show.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/8S9qdRWSnD8/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Arthur Stansel</li> <li>Carl Nell Soul Foundation</li> <li>Carzwell</li> <li>Charles Scarborough</li> <li>Ciudad Acuna</li> <li>Corsicana Airfield</li> <li>Del Rio</li> <li>Dennis Stacey</li> <li>Eastern</li> <li>Ed Dahl</li> <li>Eisenhower</li> <li>Eric Davis</li> <li>Eric Wang</li> <li>Funny</li> <li>George Knapp</li> <li>George Smithson</li> <li>Guerrero</li> <li>Guy Hoddle</li> <li>J.

Helping the Army and Air Force transform opportunities into solutions for diverse missions, from mission command capabilities to enterprise IT systems, and modeling, simulation and training. We work side by side with our customers to develop field and sustain critical capabilities for our nation's soldiers and airmen. SAIC focused on mission success. Well, that's one of those big Pentagon contractors. Those of us who believe there is UFO information and craft and materials stashed, suspect that SAIC would be one of the likely candidates to get that stuff. It's right in the heart of the larger conspiracy lore. In fact, I think that was the testimony. This is an alien reproduction vehicle, and just to be clear, this means that it is based on advanced anti-gravity and zero-point energy propulsion systems. Those are the propulsion systems. They are being manufactured by a consortium of companies that include Lockheed Martin, Northrop, SAIC and other corporations. James Defense Weekly, the popular military defense publication, published an article about SAIC, and there's a post script to the article that anyone who believes in the science of anti-gravity to be too arcane, too esoteric, even for the U.S. Air Force should consider the Electric Propulsion Study undertaken by SAIC for the Astronautics Laboratory, which is now part of the Phillips Lab. The study's primary objective was to outline physical methods to test theories of inductive coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational forces to determine the feasibility of such methods as they apply to space propulsion, and in simplified terms, an anti-gravity propulsion system. It remains for some the ultimate quantum leap. On this channel, I have discussed numerous DOD contractors and federally funded research and development centers with strong ties and paper trails to UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs. After all, the research conducted by myself and scores of other researchers over the decades have on countless occasions directly accused the U.S. Department of Defense and Intelligence community of working in tandem with defense contractors, FFRDCs and UARCs to reverse engineer exotic technologies of unknown origin, protected by special access and unacknowledged special access programs. Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right, and they'll hand recede it out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis, which I find highly unethical. You have basically a sole-source arrangement, and you allow certain private corporate elements to look at this, develop a potential insight, and then sell it back to the government for profit, and I think that's totally unethical. Whether this be Northrop Grumman in tales of legacy programs under the Tejon radar site under Antelope Valley, Lockheed Martin and accusations of constructing the TR-3B reverse-engineered alien reproduction vehicle, Battelle Memorial Institute and declassified studies of shape-memory alloys possibly originating from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash or the Aerospace Corporation and MITRE Corporation, both founded between 1959 to 1960, allegedly to exploit technologies of unknown origin. Much of our work on this channel is spent analyzing the private or semi-private sectors. Today, I want to dive back into the corporate world to cover an enormous DOD contractor and defense and technology corporation that I believe may in fact be even more intimately entwined with UFO legacy program operations and security over any other American defense contractor, Science Applications International Corporation. Many viewing this video will recognize SAIC as we will call it from here on out as a usual, tricky customer of this channel. No longer a piece of lost media. Back on 17 July 2024, long before his excellent interview on Jesse Michaels, I relayed the testimony of former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson and accused SAIC as the contractor running the Off-World Technologies division beneath the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana. Today, I'm happy to announce I will be re-releasing that investigation and while I highly recommend viewing that research in its entirety, the first time Randy spoke publicly about his encounter, we will cover his story again today in brief or detail. The trail of SAIC and UFO legacy programs is not as clear cut and glamorous as any contractor or FFRDC we have covered before on this channel. But by studying SAIC, I strongly believe we gain invaluable insights into UFO legacy program funding, infrastructure, modus operandi, secrecy, and more. So for this investigation, we will break up our research into five main areas of study, black-budget moneys, legacy program gatekeeping, sigh research, technologies of unknown origin, and material slash craft housing. At the end of this investigation, we should be able to make sense of some interesting questions such as, what should we make of Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick's former position as senior research scientist for SAIC in 2000 pre-Aero? What can we learn from former SAIC employee Denise McKinsey who discussed obfuscation of funds on enormous defense contracts? Why has SAIC historically conducted endless advanced propulsion and human psychic research? And does SAIC really run divisions storing non-human artifacts below some of the United States premier weapon centers? And their involvement in UFO legacy program operations, often called the NSA West, I believe SAIC and their decades of cutting edge, compartmentalized science and technology contracts as well as intimate ties with senior DOD and intelligence community personnel, highlight a contractor entrenched in UFO legacy programs at the highest level. SAIC is a bit of a black box. Much of what it does is proprietary or even top secret. So it's hard to tell whether what SAIC provides is necessary and effective. To understand SAIC and its corporate structure that lends perfectly to an institution entwined with U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community deep sixth black budget special access programs, we must first step back and analyze the history of SAIC. Science applications was born in 1969 from Dr. J. Robert Baster. Baster served in the U.S. Navy during World War II before earning his PhD in nuclear physics in 1950. The doctor's skills were immediately put to work for the Westinghouse Atomic Power Division on the nuclear submarine program. Baster would then join Los Alamos National Labs as a research physicist before joining General Atomics as the chair of the accelerator physics department. Quote, I was not the brilliant flash of inspiration type of entrepreneur and quote Baster would state, rather he was more of a quote unquote persistent builder type. Come 3 February 1969, Baster would start SAIC immediately stacking the company with General Atomic Scientist and created one of the first employee owned companies He made it a priority to ensure that every employee owned a part of the new company even using employee ownership as recruitment and retention tool. Staff were expected to perform superior scientific and technical work while also playing a key role in the management and direction of the company. SAIC's internal stock ownership program which promised to make government officials rich after they left public service allowed Baster to immediately pack the payroll with specialist and subject matter experts but also with generals, diplomats, spies and cabinet officers SAIC's board and high level workforce was from the company's inception staffed with high level military and intelligence personnel with unprecedented access to lucrative contracts and special access programs. Quote, they had better access to the Pentagon than the government's own attorneys, end quote. Some of these acquisitions included the illustrious Bobby Ray Inman Navy Admiral, NSA Director and CIA Deputy Director John M. Deutsch, Under Secretary of Defense under President Jimmy Carter and CIA Director under President Bill Clinton Rear Admiral William F. Raybourne who headed development of the Polaris submarine program and many many many more personnel We will address all of these figures and more such as Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick in our SAIC gatekeepers section. Indeed SAIC's ventures were so successful out of the gate Baster's very first government contracts came from the Defense Atomic Support Agency where the company was tasked with calculating the output of nuclear devices By the mid-2000s SAIC achieved unrivaled success in government science and technology contracting specializing as Vanity Fair once said in 2007 as a quote Body shop in the brain business It sells human beings who have a particular expertise Expertise about weapons, about homeland security about surveillance, about computer systems about information dominance and information warfare, end quote. By 2007 SAIC and its two major offices in San Diego, California and Washington DC ballooned to the size of an entire government agency featuring a workforce of over 44,000 larger than the manpower of the departments of labor, energy and housing and urban development combined at that time Current day outside of their major offices SAIC maintains countless locations across the continental United States many of which are near U.S. military installations or RDT&amp;E facilities such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Indiana Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada China Lake Naval Air Station, California Sandia National Labs, New Mexico and Crystal City, Virginia Similar to Northrop Grumman and their acquisition of contractors such as TRW and Teledyne Ryan and connections to federally funded research and development centers such as the Aerospace Corporation SAIC exhibits a similar, intriguing history of acquisitions, mergers associations, etc. One such corporation, allegedly spun from SAIC is DSAI Decision Science Applications Inc. founded in Virginia on 4 January 1977 DSAI operated as an employee-owned quote technical services company with expertise in military command and control systems commercial information management systems software development, electrical engineering telecommunications and physics, end quote According to some previous whistleblowers such as the controversial Colonel Steve Wilson DSAI and SAIC were one in the same with DSAI featuring a board consisting of the directors of relevant UFO Black Budget divisions including IBM, Lockheed, Teledyne Ryan Aerojet Electro Systems, etc. Wilson would also claim Bobby Ray Inman a reoccurring figure on this channel and member of the board of directors of SAIC also ran DSAI To learn more about Wilson I do recommend checking out my video on Northrop Grumman and UFO Legacy Program Operations I will not waste much time here by reviewing his whistleblower claims again Let's still briefly mention a handful of Wilson's claims and why he is relevant to today's project Wilson would disclose to Dr. Richard Boylan a UFO researcher with many publications I approach with skepticism that he, Wilson was not only stationed at Area 51 S4 where reverse engineered anti-gravity vehicles were tested but that he also spearheaded Project Pounce an elite Air Force National Reconnaissance Organization Special Forces Unit which retrieved downed UFOs with elements of JSOC, specifically Delta Force Project Pounce can be observed in the disputed Majestic-12 Project Aquarius document and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel to reduce public concern regarding UFOs Wilson would claim the first successful flight of man-made anti-gravity alien reproduction vehicles had occurred on 18 July 1971 which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test Inman, still at the Navy at this time would go on to serve as the director of the NSA deputy director of the CIA vice director of the DIA director of Naval Intelligence and board member of SAIC in the 1980s Wilson's disclosures are indeed intriguing but should of course be taken with some skepticism therefore I do recommend also reading a more skeptical take on Wilson written by Kevin Randall But relevant to our discussion is Wilson's map of Star Wars City an illustration depicting UFO legacy program operations conducted covertly within the Strategic Defense Initiative also known as SDI created in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan This SDI program will be discussed again in our project in much greater detail so please hang tight Within this chart are numerous institutions one might expect to be associated with UFO retrieval and exploitation programs the NRO, the National Security Council the National Security Agency CIA, NORAD and Majestic 12 Adhering to the SDI Colorado HQ and Magi there exists a list of contractors alleged to engage with the UFO portfolio alongside the 1010 Special Security Squadron which quote provides a high level of protection to NORAD, US Spacecom and AF Spacecom resources located at the mountain Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and IBM are mentioned Wilson would state one contractor paramount to the SDI UFO programs was Decision Science Applications, Inc. But here is where things get really interesting We don't have concrete evidence DSAI was spawned from SAIC though it is likely However, we can analyze the evolution of DSAI I would like to thank Reddit user StillChillTrill for this incredible work His account is now deleted but I will still link to his excellent posts In 1998, DSAI executed a merger into a company called DSA Acquisitions, Inc. that was then purchased by Stephen Myers &amp; Associates for almost $31 million in cash and stock By 21 August of that year, Stephen Myers &amp; Associates finalized their acquisition of DSAI-DSA Stephen Myers &amp; Associates eventually acquired Emergent Information Technologies, Inc. and SMNA changed its name to Emergent Information Technologies On 6 December 2001, Emergent Information Technologies sold its Virginia-based government services group to L3 Communications L3 Harris, formerly known as L3 Communications, is another defense contractor that has both worked alongside SAIC for enormous defense contracts and is a contractor I have been informed works directly in UFO legacy program operations But to fully complete this circle, in July of 2012 a part of L3 Communications aka L3 Harris spun off into its own publicly traded company called Angility In 2018, SAIC purchased Angility for $2.5 billion So regardless of if DSAI was spawned from SAIC eventually, DSAI assets made their way to SAIC and another defense contractor highly likely involved in UFO legacy operations, L3 Harris But if that wasn't already difficult enough to track incredibly convoluted corporate structures are commonplace with SAIC On 27 September 2013, SAIC created a $4 billion spin-off retaining the name SAIC while transforming its name to LATOS The primary reason for this spin-off was quote conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts end quote So essentially SAIC had so many contracts and was so big it had to split up to gain more So just to point out, when I refer to SAIC I am referring to both SAIC and LATOS but this gets even more interesting On 16 August 2016, LATOS merged with Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Solutions that saw LATOS acquire this Lockheed division for $5 billion And in an additional interesting event on 30 November 2017, Lockheed Martin Services Inc. changed their name to LATOS Government Services Inc. After the creation of LATOS, SAIC announced acquisition of Skeetor Holdings a defense and space manufacturing contractor with specific expertise in intelligence for $790 million This purchase was completed in an all-caste transaction and retained the majority of original Skeetor employees According to a 2008 book, Spies for Intelligence by Tim Shorok Skeetor was a critical contractor for the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology for Satellite Signals Intelligence and Electronic Intelligence The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, or DS&amp;T, is a commonplace subject on this channel serving as a legacy UFO program office that in 2002 spawned the CIA Office of Global Access Excellent journalist Chris Sharp, myself, and others have accused the Office of Global Access, or OGA as participating in foreign UFO crash retrieval operations I have additionally, when discussing U.S. Navy, UFO, foreign material, acquisition, and exploitation programs discussed the CIA, DS&amp;T, alongside the NRO, Nuro, SOCOM, Department of Energy, and more operating worldwide under-sea UFO retrieval operations I have quite a few projects to learn more about the CIA, DS&amp;T so go check out any of these projects in the video description Perhaps SAIC took note of Skeetor for their expertise in MASSINT, or Measurement and Signals Intelligence a highly classified form of intelligence, quote that uses infrared heat imaging, acoustic signatures, seismic data, and other information picked up by air and ground sensors to sniff out for weapons tests and other activities that other countries want to hide from the United States, end quote MASSINT collection is primarily managed by the DIA and used extensively by the CIA In 2005, Skeetor held a national symposium on MASSINT signature technology with contractors involved such as BAE Systems and, of course, SAIC After all, according to spies for hire, quote, Skeetor may be unknown, but it is definitely not a small player, end quote Also consider me curious and possibly suspicious that Skeetor's old building in Chant Till, Virginia, 14660 Lee Road, to be specific resides in the same corporate park with SAIC, the Aerospace Corporation, an FFRDC I have accused directly as having decades of UFO program involvement and the NRO SAIC's acquisitions and partnerships are indeed indicative of a contractor entwined with UFO legacy program operations Later in this project, we will explore this even further, such as SAIC's relationship with EG&amp;G The contractor Bob Lazar claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51S4 Equally intriguing as SAIC's acquisitions are the corporation's intimate ties with US intelligence and NAC for war profiteering From its inception, SAIC enjoyed high-level former intelligence officials on its board, but I would also like to reference a 2018 Baltimore Sun article titled Little-known contractor has close ties with staff of NSA This article, along with the excellent book The Shadow Factory by James Bamford, detail how SAIC basically became, quote unquote, A revolving door between the NSA and SAIC Interesting here as the National Security Agency or NSA is one of the US's big five intelligence agencies alongside the NRO, CIA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and likely the Hidden Neuro In numerous programs, I have implicated the NSA and UFO legacy program operations from enforcing gatekeeping in the form of treat or the tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team to management of ARV programs such as the TR3B As a side note, an unnamed retired Army Public Affairs Officer friend of mine who brushed up against legacy programs told me he was not frightened by the CIA but was terrified of the behemoth that was the NSA And later on, we will discuss possible avenues of black-budget monies conducted between SAIC and the NSA, so hold tight Keep in mind during our investigation that SAIC is an eligible contractor under the DOD's Corporate Portfolio Program The Corporate Portfolio Program gives defense industrial-based corporations like SAIC access to DOD executives, scientists, and management with broad access to special access programs The Corporate Portfolio Program framework was established in 2020 under then US Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord In an almost comical sequence of events, Lord would join SAIC's advisory board in July 2021 And as we progress in this investigation, I find it prudent to mention SAIC is accustomed to getting their way however and whenever they want Whether this be in the form of acquisitions, enormous sole-source contracts, or war profiteering efforts, many viewers on this channel are familiar with the cries of weapons of mass destruction that fueled the logic behind the Iraq war Now did you know, SAIC executives were involved at every stage of the Iraq war life cycle Indeed, quote, SAIC personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq in the first place, and that the war was the only way to get rid of them And when no weapons of mass destruction were found, SAIC personnel staffed the commission that was set up to investigate how American intelligence could have been so disastrously wrong Just to provide some further context here, in 1998 David Key, Weapons Expert and Director of SAIC's Center for Counterterrorism Technology and Analysis, Testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Saddam Hussein, quote, remains in power with weapons of mass destruction, end quote Following the Iraq war, President Bush appointed a commission to analyze how American intelligence managed to, quote, miss the truth about Iraq's weapons programs, end quote The commission published a report just one year later, absolving policymakers and US intelligence from distorting evidence of Iraq's WMDs The commission had direct ties to SAIC, including Gordon Uller, SAIC VP for Corporate Development, Jeffrey R. Cooper, VP for Technology and Chief Science Officer of one of SAIC's major subunits, and Samuel S. Visner SAIC VP and Director of Strategic Planning and Business Development for SAIC's Intelligence Group And now that we have finally set the stage for SAIC and UFO legacy programs, let's begin to dive in You can say categorically you've seen no convincing, confirmable evidence of intact spacecraft kept by the US government No, I have seen nothing that leads me to that conclusion Is it possible there is some secret program that you're just not aware of? I don't think so. I have access to anything and everything I need And the way you combat conspiracy theories and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact in science and truth So if you've got evidence for conspiracy, then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is There has been none that has been substantiated for this And everything that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when I was in that position as the director We investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from Most everything was explainable through other documentation, other programs, other people that had talked to other people Washington Shadow, NSA West, whatever you want to call it SAIC has served as a revolving door for high level US Department of Defense personnel Since the company's inception, SAIC was aggressively packed with, quote, Former generals, admirals, diplomats, spies, and cabinet officers of every kind to fill the company's board of directors and the upper echelons of its staff, end quote With such high level staff, it is no surprise there are numerous accused high level gatekeepers to UFO legacy programs with aggressive and shocking ties to SAIC Let's reflect on Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of the Pentagon's all-domain anomaly resolution office I certainly hold no love for Kirkpatrick, and I wait for many viewers of this channel share the same sentiment When I was in USDI, I read the transcripts of Sean Kirkpatrick briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on the results of his investigation in his Congressionally-tasked Arrow report, and those transcripts which were supposed to be open kimono Here's the truth, Mr. Senator, Mr. Senator, Sean Kirkpatrick, absolutely distorted, downplayed, and can't prove it, but I would say outright lied to the people who have direct responsibility for him Saying what? What did he say? It was a lie So it's more of a lie of the whole big picture, the big picture, right? In the meeting it's, you know, Congressman Rubio, we've heard about this incident We just don't have enough data to go on it to really know what this is. We don't have any way of really figuring out what's going on It could just be an anomaly. In fact, it's most likely anomaly. So starting with an acknowledgement that, you know, you have some data, but we have the insight and the scientific expertise to make you feel at ease Nothing to see here, folks, moving on Exactly. Although there was also political discussion involved in historic discussion, and, you know, I read these transcripts once, and immediately knew that Uh, yeah Veiled threat? No, I knew that I was now something else. I was, I had inside knowledge into the deception of our government by elements of our intelligence community Under Kirkpatrick, Arrow released the abysmal Arrow historical report volume one, which outright lied about some witness testimony This was proven, for example, by Michael Herrera's official Arrow memorandum for record, which showed Herrera did not claim to encounter an extraterrestrial spaceship or US special forces as falsely outlined in the Arrow report Arrow under the direction of Dr. Kirkpatrick additionally in 2022 engaged in DOD contracts with contractor Sand Corp, a company with a speciality in plugging whistleblower leaks I have also in the past shown ties with Kirkpatrick and his good buddy Ronald Moultrie, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and board member of both Battelle Memorial Institute and the Meiter Corporation and how Kirkpatrick and Moultrie enjoy debunking claims of UFOs at previous Arrow roundtables The guy that formed Arrow upon whose recommendation Arrow was formed is a guy named Ed Moultrie who is Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and he was on Battelle's board and he scrubbed that from his LinkedIn And my good friend, UAP Gerb, who is an amazing channel, he's a super deep UFO researcher, showed that it was on his resume and then he recommends that Arrow formed, it's like a total conflict of interest, it's insane, it's insane Kirkpatrick during his time at Arrow and post Arrow has frequently engaged in dismissing any and all whistleblower claims, often resorting to emotionally charged outbursts You believe them? I believe that they believe what they're telling me and I, my job is not to, it's not a question of belief, right, it's a question of what can I go research There is absolutely nothing that I'm going to do say or produce evidentiary that is going to make the true believers convert, if you will It's almost like a religion, it is basically a religion Myself and others have wagered Kirkpatrick served and possibly still serves as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs This sentiment was shared by witness Ed of the 412th Test Wing who refused to testify to Arrow under Kirkpatrick as according to Ed, Kirkpatrick is an insider meant to squash information The doctor's employment history pre and post Arrow is additionally intriguing, the good doctor has filed many patents including 2022 and 2023 patents for quote System and methods for determining influence of channels in a social network, end quote But that is not our interest today, no instead it is Sean Kirkpatrick's former patents with SAIC including a 2003 filing for quote Holographic recording and micro slash nano fabrication via ultra fast holographic two photon induced photopolymerization, H-T-P-I-P, end quote Between joining the NRO and CIA in 2003 and 2005 respectively and working within the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1997, Kirkpatrick worked at SAIC as a senior research scientist We can specifically review work for SAIC as a senior research scientist in the year 2000 Now how interesting is that a senior SAIC scientist went on to spearhead a questionable office in Arrow that was originally supposed to be called the UAP JPO which some have called Project Blue Book 2.0 Now flashback to 1987, SAIC had previously conducted some of Sean Kirkpatrick's favorite type of science for the DOE, aspects of turbulence and non-linear solutions Shortly after leaving both the Pentagon and Arrow Kirkpatrick began his own LLC called non-linear solutions As of 1 January 2025, non-linear solutions has been subcontracted by the MITRE Corporation An FFRDC I have spoken about ad nauseum on this channel for DOD indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts for US space com The description of this MITRE contract reads, quote, award of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for National Security Engineering Center Federally Funded Research and Development Center FFRDC, end quote The NSAC run by MITRE in McLean, Virginia operates to, quote, provide the US and its allies and partners with the ability to anticipate and solve the most consequential national security problems requiring integration across missions, capabilities, organizations, and nations, end quote I do wonder what sort of support non-linear solutions can offer as a subcontractor for MITRE under US space com here, but Kirkpatrick did have previous experience with space com, serving as the intelligence community lead for a US space com task force in 2018 to 2019 Now I mention that to recall back to September 2024 when excellent researcher TAG underscore OM recovered FOIA documents from US space com dated 31 January 2023 These documents outlined a briefing conducted by Kirkpatrick to high level DOD attendees on, quote, UAP response and recovery and material transfer, end quote I do sure wonder what non-linear solutions and MITRE plan to do with US space com In December 2023 Kirkpatrick also joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory as the chief technology officer for defense and intelligence programs. Oak Ridge is of course a DOE sponsored FFRDC administered by Battelle Memorial Institute These are patterns we simply cannot ignore. Why is a former SAIC senior research scientist so intimately involved with FFRDCs and UARC institutions? I commonly connect to UFO programs after his tenure as the DOD's mouthpiece to debunk UFO information with Arrow Let us now transition to the most legendary testimony of gatekeeping UFO legacy programs in history, the Wilson Davis memo So in this video in the interest of time I will assume the viewer has some knowledge of the Wilson Davis meeting notes so if you don't go check out my first ever video on this channel It's a little rough but still gets the message across In short these disputed but highly likely accurate notes transcribed by Dr. Eric Davis leaked from the estate of the late astronaut Edgar Mitchell These notes recount a 2002 conversation between Davis and Vice Admiral and former DIA director Thomas Wilson outside of the parking lot of contractor EG&amp;G in Nevada The conversation recounts Wilson finding but being stonewalled in accessing UFO recovery and material exploitation programs Protected by the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee, SAPOC, Senior Review Group, SRG and a large defense contractor I-Wager might in fact be SAIC According to Wilson he was informed by General Michael Ward to search a special records group in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Belonging to special legacy holdover programs from before special access program restructuring efforts in the early 1990s In the memo UFO programs were reorganized under SAPOC SRG after an internal audit almost revealed the programs This SAPOC reorganization began on 5 January 1994 when the Deputy Secretary of Defense significantly enhanced and strengthened changes in the DOD Special Access Program SAP management and control structure This newsletter on screen now highlights those changes establishing the Senior Review Group We can also possibly find some useful data. In the GAO's May 1993 report titled, quote, DOD Special Access Program's administrative due process not provided when access is denied or revoked, end quote Which discusses the Navy and Air Force not complying with DOD regulation 6200.2 slash R which discussed special access program access I did find it interesting that between the Army, Air Force, and Navy it was in fact the Army that did comply in some cases for SAP regulations according to this GAO document And according to some of my research this makes sense to me as well as I am familiar with cases in which the US Army seemed to operate UFO material exploitation programs in a strict controlled environment with oversight While Navy and Air Force legacy programs seemed to operate far more loosely and out of control But let's take a deeper look at the SAPOC in its Senior Review Group that was upon its creation by the Deputy Secretary of Defense tasked with gatekeeping UFO legacy programs according to VA DM Wilson Around the time of this restructuring, the SAPOC was chaired by Deputy Secretary of Defense the Honorable John Deutch. Mind you, John Deutch did not restructure SAPOC as DEP SECDEF This was conducted by his predecessor William Perry, but Deutch immediately followed suit in the role Immediately pre his position chairing SAPOC as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Deutch served as the Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition and technology The same office Wilson learned contained UFO legacy files Now, Deutch here is very interesting. Based upon the testimony of VA DM Wilson, we can conclude with a high degree of certainty Deutch served as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs Deutch served as a Director of Central Intelligence, a professor at MIT, enjoyed numerous positions within the DOE And also served as a consultant pre-work on SAPOC with TRW, Los Alamos National Labs, and MITRE, three institutions I directly accuse of being involved in UFO programs But that's not all. Pre-1995, possibly during his tenure as DEP SECDEF and within the AUSDAT, Deutch served as the Director of SAIC And even worked in SAIC's La Jolla office, the same office of Denise McKenzie So, here's what we're left with. According to Wilson, the reorganization of SAPOC and creation of the senior review group directly served to gatekeeper UFO legacy programs from even a three star admiral and DIA director DEP SECDEF William J. Perry conducted such a reorganization in February of 1994 and immediately one month after a new DEP SECDEF is assigned and put in charge as chairman of SAPOC This being a former SAIC director But that's not all. To put the real cherry on top here, even William J. Perry himself who reorganized SAPOC in 1994 once served on the board of SAIC One could be chance, two as a pattern, so let's extend this further During his investigations, Vice Admiral Wilson spoke to two permanent members of the Special Access Program Oversight Committee Brigadier General Mike Kostanik and Paul Kaminsky, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, preceded by Deutch Kaminsky and permanent senior review group member Lynn Wells are both lifelong MITRE Corporation members, but I digress A permanent SAPOC member post-SAP restructuring is Admiral William A. Owens, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Outside of his prestigious naval career and service as senior military assistant to Dick Cheney, Owens additionally served as the CEO for SAIC All in all, the SAPOC, which was restructured in the early 1990s to serve as a gatekeeping structure for UFO legacy programs according to Wilson, saw two of six personnel as former SAIC alumni This is why I wager the contractor Wilson accused as operating alongside the SAPOC SRG for UFO secrecy is in fact SAIC And let's not forget a critical third man mentioned in the Wilson Davis notes, Naval Reserve Commander Willard Miller Miller attended the 1997 meeting with VAD and Wilson and Stephen Greer, and yes, this meeting did take place, this is a fact During this meeting in the EG&amp;G parking lot between Davis and Wilson, Davis flashed a 2002 letter addressed to him from Commander Miller Within the letter, Miller offered to aid Davis and physicist Hal Putoff in their UFO crash retrieval research Miller requested anonymity, clearly this wasn't honored, but offered to connect the men to multiple high value targets and information including A senior official with knowledge on alien reproduction vehicles, a list of civilian DOD contractors involved in UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs In a team possibly involved with UFO crash retrievals Where did Miller get this intel? Was it first hand experience, exposure to programs or connections in the corporate world? Because Miller did after all work as a quote senior analyst in future counter threat planning, directed energy weapons, space systems and Navy space wargaming Indeed in a 2000 book called Swamp Gas Times, my two decades on the UFO beat by Patrick Hugh, emails between Commander Miller and Attorney Peter Gersten are detailed Miller believed quote The relationship has both interest in and concern about the UFO phenomenon If there are any keepers of the keys, they reside in DOD middle management and civilian DOD contractors, BDM, SAIC, Boeing, Lockheed And the com-trollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs Outside of the Wilson Davis notes, there are numerous possible high level SAIC personnel serving as gatekeepers for UFO programs Discussed already today and in my previous work, we have the US Admiral, Director of the NSA, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of Neuro, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Who went from in 1989 discussing recovered UFOs becoming available for technological research with NASA mission specialist Bob Echler to saying he found plausible answers for all UFO sightings to project unity in 2022 We can also take an interesting look at US Navy Admiral William F. Rayborn Alongside John Deutch and Bobby Ray Inman, Rayborn was plucked for senior SAIC roles to stack the contractors payroll with scores of influential members of the National Security Establishment Prior to his retirement from the Navy in 1963 and also prior to his positions within SAIC and the Director of National Intelligence from 1965 to 1966, Rayborn led the project to develop the Polaris missile system The Polaris program, a two-stage solid-fueled nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile, should sound extremely familiar to some viewers of my Naval UFO Legacy Program's video A small detail, but in this video I discussed how Dr. John P. Craven, Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office for the US Navy, spearheaded the Deep System Submergence Project and resulting deep-submergence rescue vehicles that I implicated in undersea UFO crash retrieval operations Craven himself stated the aforementioned DSSP and submersibles DSRBs were used for a tremendous amount of clandestine classified missions Craven also stated in his book The Silent War, the Deep Submergence Systems Project, which served to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform undersea engineering operations was created specifically to accomplish retrieval operations under Operation Sand-Dollar According to Craven's memoirs, Sand-Dollar was a clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items of national security importance from the seafloor of the continental shelf in the deep marine environments Craven wrote that this program Sand-Dollar is classified to this day, quote, I was shown an inventory itemizing the items known to be on the seabed and a map of their distribution throughout the world, end quote Outlining the complicated obfuscation of Sand-Dollar within the special access program world, Dr. Craven would state Sand-Dollar was buried within the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris program Intriguing how Sand-Dollar, what eye wager was a UFO crash retrieval program, was buried under a web of programs hidden within the Polaris program, a program itself founded by Admiral Rayborn who would later on become an SAIC board member Let's finally discuss a possible gatekeeper to waived deep six UFO programs with high level ties to CIA and SAIC, Donald M. Kerr Kerr joined SAIC in 1993 as a corporate executive and vice president and director Kerr's resume includes director of Los Alamos National Labs from 79 to 85, president and director of EG&amp;G from 89 to 92, CIA deputy director for science and technology from 01 to 05, director of the NRO from 05 to 07, and principal deputy director of national intelligence from 07 to 09 Recall if you will the 1985 advanced theoretical physics working group and the notes of attendee Oki Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos and character in the Wilson Davis notes Held at the BDM Secure Facility in McLean, Virginia, this conference classified via DOE controls was supervised by the infamous Colonel John B. Alexander and held at BDM just one year after one of the primary characters of this channel, U.S. Army Inscom General Albert Stubblebine joined BDM International Oki Shannon startling notes from this conference reveal several discussions of interest for this channel, including mention of a major engineering project that existed under Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, naval information on underwater UFO hotspots near Gulfo San Matias, Argentina and mention of an organization that collects, manages and destroys UFO information Scribbled within the notes are actions Oki wished to pursue to continue a quest for cracking UFO reverse engineering programs. Towards the end of this page is a note discussing approaching Donald Kerr for influence and money. In almost every single project I do, I discuss the CIA's Office of Global Access established under the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology in 2003 to serve as a logistics coordinator harnessing the muscle of joint special operations command for foreign UFO crash retrievals. This CIA DSNT was additionally, alongside the Navy, the co-founder of Neuro, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, the U.S.'s most secret intelligence agency and one I have connected to underwater UFO crash retrievals. This Office of Global Access was actually established under the watch of Donald Kerr, former VP of SAIC in the 90s, who remember served as the deputy director of the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology from 01 to 05. How does a program like that get funded? I will give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session, but misappropriation of funds and self-fund. Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program but it doesn't and it goes to something else? Yes, I have specific knowledge of that. Do you think U.S. corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the U.S. government and that additional money is going to programs? Correct, through something called IRAD. In 2004, Catherine Austin Fitts, former Assistant Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, released the now legendary paper titled Black Budget of the United States. Throughout the 21st century, Fitts has identified trillions of dollars spent on the U.S. black budget. Fitts has outlined 21 trillion dollars in unauthorized spending in the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development from 1995 to 2015. Much of this money on UFO-related, quote-unquote, clandestine military R&amp;D. Recently, Fitts made a couple of podcast appearances on Tucker Carlson's and Danny Jones' shows, making some incredible statements regarding one of my favorite topics, deep underground military bases or dumbs. Over the years, Fitts has also engaged in some intriguing discussion of UFO legacy programs on Dark Journalist's page, including UFO economies 1, 2, and 3. Here's the thing, I'm glad you brought this up because I know you've had Richard on, and again, Richard's going to be on the Salier Report next week. And that's Richard Dole and the author of UFOs in the National Security State. Well, that's the best book in terms of describing the mechanisms put in place after World War II to create a far-expanded infrastructure for what I call the black budget. So you literally see the federal credit engineered in a way that can generate trillions and trillions of dollars for an infrastructure of private corporations and investors to control the most powerful technology in the world. To try and figure out what that technology is, you know, is to go down a rabbit hole full of very squiggling information about what is and is not true, but suffice it to say that a tremendous amount of that money has gone into very high technology weaponry and certainly an investment in space and space travel. Fitz is surprisingly well-versed in UFO legacy programs, commenting on covert space economies, breakaway civilizations, the SDI or Strategic Defense Initiative being used to counter extraterrestrial threats, and black budget operations surrounding UFOs. Fitz even once argued to Dark Journalist, up to $60 trillion may have been spent on secret space program and UFO technologies, suggesting TUO or Technologies of Unknown Origin may be worth up to $150 trillion. Perhaps one day I can sit down with Catherine Austin-Fitz and have a very poignant discussion on UFO legacy program financing, but I would like to circle back to black budget of the United States. In the paper, Fitz writes, quote, large portions of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels, end quote, to support clandestine domestic military research and development. While stat, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fitz came across evidence IT slash accounting systems providers were responsible for the obfuscation of funds and omitting data where DOD funds were directed. These included Lockheed Martin information systems, which would later merge with Lados in 2015, IBM, DineCorp, and of course SAIC. One of the things I used to have these fights with the defense contractors because I was required to get the accounts when we, I still needed data and the systems were run by the big defense contractors at HUD, and they would refuse to give me the data so I'd have these wars with them. It's like, who really runs HUD? Is it the defense contractor or is it the point, you know, the person who's legally responsible? And speculating, I'd say they have a very perfect situation to do any type of research they want to under the guise of anything, I mean, and call it what they want. And they definitely aren't working alone in anything. So anybody doing business with them, they are what's called like a conglomerate. There's SAIC, but it's made up of numerous individual corporations, and these corporations, some of them are very well known and some of them are smaller, but they have some very big genius minds there and a lot of very cutting-edge work being done there. And millions and millions of dollars coming in. And since it's privately owned corporations, I don't know, the only people they'd have to report to is the ones they're doing business with and they're contracting with. And so if the people they're contracting with wish to do something that maybe isn't in the best interest of everyone, nobody is going to know about it. It's all kept in-house, the funding, the financing, the contracts, there should be files, there should be documentation, and a regular timeline of events on every project which did not exist whatsoever. And if I'm working in a military division and I have access to all the files, where were these, where was this documentation? So it made me very suspicious of where all this money was going. Let's now reference the 2001 testimony of former SAIC administrative employee Denise McKenzie. McKenzie's testimony is somewhat legendary in the UFO legacy program Financial Analyst Community. After all, McKenzie's experiences were detailed on text in Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document, and she was never heard from again. It's even more interesting, the big defense contractor that does all the UFO stuff, like for the military and the government, is in La Jolla. And out in front of their building, they have two eight foot tall Egyptian statues, and one is holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the past, and one's holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the future. And they're big bronze statues in front of this company. In this company, I have on one of these tapes a girl testifying how they put billions of dollars or millions of dollars into UFO related programs, and they create them and they're fake. So when they get audited by the general accounting office of the United States government, it just looks like all the money's going into more helicopters, but it's really going into like UFO related programs. Today, I'm thrilled to announce I have found McKenzie's March 2001 videotaped interview nestled within the files of the DPI archive. I have also found and made outreach to Mrs. McKenzie herself. I do hope she connects with me in the future, but for now let's analyze her complete recorded testimony. McKenzie was introduced to SAIC while working retail in 1992. While working at a fabric store in a San Diego mall, a part-time co-worker of McKenzie named Sophia asked her to move to SAIC at La Jolla, San Diego, where Sophia primarily worked. Denise had never heard of the defense giant, but was intrigued to work a cushy office job on a massive campus. When she first visited the La Jolla site, McKenzie expected to interview for an administrative assistant position. But with no paperwork or meetings, McKenzie was immediately told she had the job. She didn't even know the department in which she was supposed to work. During her first few days in the office, McKenzie noticed her recruiter, Sophia, was not present at SAIC and wouldn't show up for another two to three weeks. During her first three to four days of work, McKenzie had no real tasks. She would wander her building of work to look busy, gauging the department's computer files and personnel. McKenzie would realize she worked within SAIC's military contract division. Within SAIC La Jolla on Campus Drive, Denise would notice a highly classified biological division that featured extremely strict personnel access control. And let's take a quick pause here. SAIC has a history of intriguing chemical and biological contracts. Let's note this 2005 SAIC Research Development Test and Evaluation Group contract that tasked SAIC's McLean, Virginia and San Diego, California divisions to perform biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, and explosive, or CBRNE work with the Air Force Operational Test Center and Evaluation Center, or AFO-TEC, at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. Kirtland Air Force Base is not only home to a deep underground military installation, but also to Sandia National Labs, an FFRDC, which is a usual tricky customer of this channel for operational locations of UFO legacy programs. Recurring viewers of my channel will absolutely recognize Sandia, and by the way, SAIC has a history of absolutely enormous contracts with Sandia National Labs, such as this 2013 $228 million contract for IT consolidation for, quote, mission-specific information technology research development and integration of capabilities while maintaining high-performance and central-hosting computing desktop services and cybersecurity, end quote. What is interesting about this specific relationship with SAIC and AFO-TEC for CBRNE work we just mentioned above is a quote from SAIC's Senior Vice President Chuck Zhang, quote, under the CBRNE contract, SAIC will assess new and emerging technologies and concepts, will work to determine their technological maturity when operated under realistic environments to help give US warfighters the tools they need to do their jobs more safely and effectively, end quote. It is interesting how SAIC's biological work has been contracted from AFO-TEC, or the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center we just mentioned above. AFO-TEC historically has supported the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts, or DUSD-AS&amp;C, for all non-traditional acquisition programs. In the future, I'll be paying much closer attention to this DUSD-AS&amp;C and the office's possible involvement in UFO legacy programs. After all, according to the General Accounting Office in 2002, DUSD-AS&amp;C was responsible for DOD Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration Programs. The connections to our work here are indeed perplexing. SAIC has a history of being awarded sole-source contracts to support the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, or JTAA. A large part of the JTAA portfolio supports the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts, or the DUSD-AS&amp;C. Many of these sole-source SAIC JTAA contracts are for work at, you guessed it, the Naval Service Warfare Center Crane, which allegedly houses the Off-World Technologies Division. Funny enough, former DUSD-AS&amp;C appointees have a history of working for contractors suspected of being involved with UFO legacy program operations before and after service in the Office of the Undersecretary for Defense. These include Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Sue C. Payton, who served as a manager of advanced technology and Lockheed Martin before her service in the DOD. But after that brief sidestep into SAIC and their biological departments, let's get back to the story of Denise McKenzie. McKenzie's work picked up when she received numerous letters from U.S. military and defense contractors requesting Project Report updates. McKenzie's immediate superiors blew off the importance of these Project Report updates, instructing McKenzie to issue a generic response to DOD and contractors alike, saying something to the effect of, quote, we're working on it, end quote. Eager to perform efficiently in her new role, Denise McKenzie would retrieve files and computer disks pertaining to the letters she received. Each and every contract file, ranging from recent to several years old, contained only two to three form letters, all stating the same thing, quote, it's being worked on, end quote. Some of these forms were signed by SAIC senior personnel and some were left completely unsigned. These were enormous contracts worth millions and millions of dollars with absolutely zero activity on the contracts. McKenzie reported the missing contract activity to her recruiter, Sophia, who grew furious Denise took initiative to search through SAIC's file database. During her interview, Denise pondered why Sophia, positioned under SAIC's head scientist, was working and recruiting new SAIC administrative personnel from a fabric store at a mall. McKenzie was ordered to bring all files and disks pertaining to relevant contracts to her immediate superiors and to forget all about the matter. In her following short time at SAIC, McKenzie was harassed by her head supervisor, a man named Stuart Stanley. I'm trying to track down this Stuart and while unable to find him yet, I haven't covered a man by that name residing in La Jolla San Diego at the time of Denise's employment at SAIC. McKenzie's final straw occurred at the contractor when she choked on food and her immediate supervisor stood by and watched instead of attempting to help or to call an ambulance. After leaving the company, McKenzie would search the early internet for her recruiter, Sophia, and would eventually find an image of Sophia on a CIA website with a different first name and same last name. This webpage listed deceased agents and while her incident took place in 1992, quote unquote, Sophia had supposedly died in 1987 or 1988. Remember if you will, SAIC's relationship with the NSA, intimate ties with the US Big Five intelligence agencies appear rampant with SAIC. I thought they were getting a lot of money for doing nothing and I didn't know where that money was going. It's like a friend, a friend for something. I mean, if it wasn't such a big complex and evidently well known, which I found out, you know, as I worked there, I would have been very suspicious of what was going on. And if you wanted to just hide funds or push funds through and call it whatever you want, Joe's Market, I mean, it was like Joe's Market on a huge scale. So what was I to do about it? I mean, there wasn't much I could say or do about it. Mackenzie was not the only SAIC employee in 1992 to make such allegations. According to the excellent 2007 Vanity Fair article titled Washington's Shadow, quote, According to one former executive in a sworn deposition in 1992, the practice of quote unquote mischarging became institutionalized within the company, end quote. Analyzing Mackenzie's testimony, we can see SAIC ran enormous contracts with DoD and other contractors with absolutely zero activity on these contracts. This implies these monies were funneled from legitimate projects into more secret black budget clandestine operations. And perhaps we have a real instance of this we can analyze. Banning into space, a layered defense to protect the country from nuclear devastation. U.S. spy satellites would watch the world below, detect Soviet missiles blasting off, compute the position and speed of each missile, alert battle stations in space on Earth. The first response, space-based kinetic energy weapons fire high-speed projectiles from hypervelocity guns, intercepting enemy missiles as they are boosted through the atmosphere. Popped up into space, Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays. Attack rays from land-based eczema lasers are redirected by huge mirrors orbiting in space. Chemical lasers fire beams that burn through the shell of the onrushing missile. Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays join the attack. Still over the atmosphere. In the same year of 1992, then-Secretary of Defense, the infamous Dick Cheney, was called to investigate whistleblower claims of fraud and waste surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative. Since 1986, scientist Aldrich Saussier claimed the SDI, or Star Wars program, displayed a pattern of, quote, miss-management and abuse, and wasteful spending on research and development, end quote, miss-reporting and misleading Congress of its efficacy. Saussier was dismissed from the Star Wars program for, quote, poor performance and was even investigated by the FBI. Democratic Congressman John Conyers determined actions against Saussier were whistleblower retaliatory activities. And by 1992, Cheney reviewed the case and Saussier was given whistleblower protection. But why is any of this important here? I have talked in several projects of backdoor UFO programs being built into Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative, a missile defense system built to defend the United States from attacks by ballistic nuclear missiles. Let's break this down in a second, but since SDI's inception in 1983, U.S. contractors including SAIC and their systems integrator abilities were relied on more than ever by the Defense Department for successful implementation of SDI. In 1985, SAIC had an employee, retired USAF two-star general Jasper Welch that exclusively coordinated with Star Wars efforts. In 1985, SAIC had won more strategic defense initiative-related contracts than General Dynamics, Northrop, Raytheon, Grumman, and the Rand Corporation combined. Beginning in 1978 and throughout Star Wars, SAIC was, quote, best represented contractor, end quote, for a key SDI technology, particle beam weapons. So essentially, SAIC had been accused by Catherine Austin Fitz as back-channeling money from legitimate contracts into clandestine operations. Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was proven by the whistleblower claims of Aldrich Saussier to purposely mislead Congress on the efficacy of SDI, end quote, wasteful spending on research and development, end quote. And SAIC was considered a critical contractor for their expertise and reliability for critical work on SDI. Now I just previously said there are numerous implications SDI actually held a swath of UFO programs that saw secret monies backchannel from primarily SDI funding mechanisms. With SAIC's work on SDI and history of illegally diverting funds from legitimate to black-budget contracts, I do not at all think it is a stretch to assume SAIC was one of the primary contractors engaged with SDI and UFO legacy programs. Previously, I discussed the involvement of Northrop, the Grumman Corporation, and Teledyne Ryan, a Northrop Grumman purchase in regards to SDI and UFO programs, but today we have much more to discuss. One whistleblower I have covered in depth on this channel is former USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet in his claims of the reverse engineered alien reproduction vehicle called the TR-3B. As I have stated before, although Fouchet was unable to provide material evidence for the existence of TR-3B, his disclosures have served to deliver some extremely actionable intelligence. During his 1998 disclosures, Fouchet would discuss the DARCE, the Defense Advanced Research Center allegedly stationed underground near Area 51 Grum Lake that worked on UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation projects. The DARCE in question, the Defense Advanced Research Center, not to be confused with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, was actually a proposed institution. So let's reference this declassified Advanced Research Project Agency study written in 1973. The study in question was written as a historical evaluation of the R&amp;D Management Institution, ARPA, who at this time had, quote, remarkably little in the way of an official record or institutional memory had been established, end quote. On page 82 of the document under ARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects, we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was considered for transfer into the DARCE, the Defense Advanced Research Center, linking the department to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist in Operation Paperclip Transfer, Werner von Braun. Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry, Hermann Oberth, who performed extensive study on UFOs. And I've previously covered how extensively Nazi scientists were involved in early UFO programs, such as discussing Hans Kamler, director of numerous Nazi special weapons projects who may have been tasked with studying the 1933 Magenta Italy crashed UFO, who curiously went missing near the end of the war, but was claimed to be working with Americans post-World War II, as well as Xavier Dorsch, head of the TOT organization, who was requested by Air Material Command for Operation Paperclip for underground plant construction. Fusche would state DARCE was bolstered in the mid-1980s when the institution was flushed with money from the Strategic Defense Initiative. Fusche and his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding was siphoned off to support the UFO Black programs. Indeed, for its maiden operational flight in the mid-1990s, Fusche would state the TR-3B, whose program was administrated by the NRO, NSA, and CIA, and worked primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, and Teledyne Ryan, the reverse engineered vehicle was built by Strategic Defense Initiative money. In 2013, stealth aircraft researcher Joseph Jones would claim the existence of Project Brilliant Buzzard, a codename for an airborne surveillance and tracking program that dealt with setting up an electromagnetic shield around the US, utilizing an enormous boomerang-shaped craft. This boomerang featured an almost indefinite loiter time, and Brilliant Buzzard was allegedly primarily contracted to Boeing. The Brilliant Buzzard craft was seemingly responsible for 25,000 eye-witness sightings between 1983 and 1989 of the Hudson Valley boomerang, and this enormous craft was, of course, allegedly a program born from the Strategic Defense Initiative. Viewers of my channel will know I adore referencing the work of legendary UFO crash retrieval investigator Leonard Stringfield to analyze relevant UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation cases. And as it turns out, we do have a rather intriguing Star Wars case in crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7, specifically 1991's UFO crash retrievals the Inner Sanctum Status Report 6. Stringfield's eclectic work analyzed a 1989 UFO crash retrieval case alleged to have occurred over Maritius Bay, Long Island, New York, USA. Now, be mindful that there is an additional Long Island, New York UFO crash retrieval case that allegedly occurred in 1992. This 92 case is indeed perplexing and features numerous eye-witnesses and the possible involvement of the Department of Energy's FFRDC Brookhaven National Laboratory located in Upton, New York. Perhaps we will revisit this case in an extended session soon, but let's circle back to 1989, the work of Stringfield and reporting from LIUFON, the Long Island UFO Network. This case details a crashed UFO in the area of Maritius Bay off the south shore of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York on the early morning of 29 September 1989. And according to LIUFON and Stringfield, the craft crashing was not an accident, but instead a carefully planned and executed military intelligence operation to down the craft. According to an anonymous Air Force Intelligence Colonel, the incident involved the downing of a UFO by the use of a US Star Wars weapon on that night. The craft crashed into the Dune area where it was subsequently retrieved, end quote. Quite shockingly, this unnamed Colonel additionally stated 18 US servicemen were killed by biologics on board the craft who retaliated with a device that quote, generates extremely low frequency sound waves which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter. Quite the extraordinary claim and a claim that I can find no record of regarding the deaths of several US servicemen. However, multiple eyewitnesses including a commodities broker claimed to have seen helicopters transporting a large object and military vehicles with a police escort headed towards Brookhaven National Labs. Another anonymous source, this time a Brookhaven scientist named Dr. Nick, told LIUFON investigators a large wedge or boomerang shaped object with shockingly low mass was recovered and transported to Brookhaven. Having previously worked under Wright Patterson AFB to study UFOs, Dr. Nick claimed the weapon utilized to down the craft was constructed by AIL electronics. Now remember how the anonymous Colonel claimed the craft was down by a strategic defense initiative weapon and according to Dr. Nick, Brookhaven National Labs deployed this weapon. Brookhaven is of course a Department of Energy sponsored FFRDC. Brookhaven additionally did work on the strategic defense initiative such as aiding in SDI's lethality and target hardening projects. Reference for example this 1987 DTIC document titled Report to the Congress on Strategic Defense Initiative and quote Alongside White Sands missile range and Los Alamos National Labs, Brookhaven aided SDI through study and testing of SDI weapons that quote required lethal energy to achieve a sure kill against the full spectrum of enemy targets. One contractor that worked alongside Brookhaven, White Sands and Los Alamos for SDI's lethality and target hardening program was of course SAIC. Interesting how SAIC and Brookhaven which was allegedly involved with shooting down a UFO over Long Island, New York both worked on SDI's and specifically the Defense Nuclear Agency's lethality and target hardening programs that had a specific goal of assessing the lethality of X-ray laser weapons against SDI threats. All this boils down of course to the subject of directed energy weapons. Sources of mine have specifically informed me of SDI X-ray weapons that were used to disable and down UFOs. These connections between SAIC, black budget monies and Reagan's strategic defense initiative are quite potent and well worth exploring further in our future studies. SAIC's misappropriation of funds doesn't just stop with the testimony of Mackenzie or likely involvement with SDI UFO programs. No, we have very real examples of SAIC wasting obscene amounts of money on contracts. In 2002, a consortium run by SAIC including Boeing and Booz Allen Hamilton was chosen by the National Security Agency to create Trailblazer. A system intended to analyze mass collections of data on communication methods such as cell phones, email, and internet. This contract was worth at its inception over $280 million and ballooned to billions within four years. This program was even worked on by SAIC board member Bobby Ray Inman. Multiple NSA employees filed a complaint with the DoD Inspector General regarding enormous amounts of fraud, waste, and abuse existing in SAIC's Trailblazer when a successful operating prototype had already previously existed. By 2005, the DoD Inspector General released a report on the investigation where 90-plus percent of the findings were redacted. Some of the whistleblowers here including NSA employee William Binney were harassed and raided by the FBI. Interesting how Binney has additionally commented on UFOs. Well, I think my problem is just like the UFO thing. Unless they start addressing these kinds of things, that people's observations or basic measurements or facts will kind of evidence that simply exist. Unless they start addressing them, there's always going to be questions that people are going to question and never trust. I mean, especially now with the government, how much trust do you have in this government? Bizarrely, after the colossal failure that was Trailblazer, SAIC was immediately awarded a contract for Execute Locust, a revised Trailblazer program well worth $361 million. SAIC's failed efforts on enormous contracts are not uncommon. Take VCF for example, Virtual Case File, a $124 million contract with the FBI to create an online central repository of data to serve the FBI. Only three years into Virtual Case File, the project was written off by a global publication for technology professionals as the, quote, most highly publicized software failure in history, end quote. According to the 2007 Vanity Fair article on SAIC, we discussed earlier, quote, If it turns out they can't deliver, new contracts will simply be drawn up, end quote. Indeed, SAIC's convenient ineptitude to secure lucrative contracts for no work and whopping failures doesn't just end here. In 2005, SAIC's La Jolla San Diego location, which was patrolled by DOD certified industrial security personnel, was broken into. This never solved burglary, according to SAIC, saw the theft of one desktop computer and four laptops out of 13 private offices containing personal data on thousands of present and past employees. Presumably including the company's many former CIA operatives and SA executives and Pentagon officials, quite the targeted theft here. And I really cannot stress here how many incredibly suspicious and dubious actions SAIC has conducted over the years that speaks to misappropriation and funneling of funds used, in my opinion, for black budget UFO programs. Further examples in this laundry list include SAIC defrauding the U.S. government from 1987 to 1995 by creating fake, non-functioning prototypes for a USAF contract to develop flat panel liquid crystal displays to be used on various fighter jets. As well as an early 2000s incident in which SAIC was charged with fraud for submitting, quote, false and fraudulent statements of its expected cost and profits, and quote, for waste cleanup at various U.S. Air Force bases. But before we move on here, I would like to touch on some of the relationships SAIC has maintained with DOD defense contractors that have been time and time again implicated with black budget projects and UFO legacy programs. I'd like to draw your attention back to EG&amp;G, also known as Edgerton, Germanhausen and Greer Inc. and I would wager most on this channel have some familiarity with this intriguing contractor that historically engaged closely with some of the U.S.'s most secret technologies. Started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Harold Edgerton in 1931, EG&amp;G's activities are legendary in the UFO community before the company was acquired by URS in 2002 and again by AECOM in 2014. Historically, EG&amp;G shared responsibility at the Nevada test site including Nellis Air Force Base in Area 51 for weapons development and high-tech testing alongside Lawrence Livermore Labs, Raytheon and others. EG&amp;G's legendary status in the UFO community arose from it being labeled as the contractor Bob Lazar claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51 site 4. Quite recently, I also discussed how EG&amp;G was one of multiple components connected with UFO legacy programs that comprised the Department of Energy NEST or Nuclear Emergency Response Team and how I wagered the DOE NEST supported by EG&amp;G was the on-site technical and scientific team that recovered a crashed UFO in the Peruvian jungle in 1997 witnessed by USMC Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan. According to journalist George Knapp, Alfred O'Donnell, a now deceased former senior manager at EG&amp;G, relayed to Knapp that quote-unquote they, meaning EG&amp;G, had in its possession a flying saucer recovered in New Mexico as well as live non-human beings that looked vaguely human. Remember EG&amp;G but just stick around here with me for a second as I state to probably an annoying degree a key component overlooked from joint USG contractor UFO legacy program operations are the subject matter experts and R&amp;D ACES, FFRDCs are federally funded research and development centers. Over the course of my work, I have accused numerous such FFRDCs as acting as key players in UFO material exploitation and crash retrieval programs including Sandia National Labs, Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs, the Center for Naval Analysis, the MITRE Corporation, the RAND Corporation and more. The Administrator for Los Alamos National Labs, for example, on behalf of the Department of Energy is a little known corporation known as Triad National Security LLC. Triad National Security has a storied history of intriguing publications but relevant to our discussion is how Triad is comprised of three entities, Texas A&amp;M University, the University of California and Battelle Memorial Institute. Alongside FFRDCs, I have spoken on their university semi-private counterparts, UARCs, or university affiliated research centers and their involvement in UFO legacy programs. The two universities comprising Triad are not UARCs, but interesting nonetheless. The contractor here of interest within Triad is Battelle and Battelle is no stranger to this channel. From its possible involvement studying Roswell Shape Memory Alloys to its parallel project Blue Book called Project Stork to research associating Battelle to dugway-proving ground UFO legacy programs, Battelle is infamous on this channel. Battelle itself runs multiple FFRDCs including Oak Ridge, a Sean Kirkpatrick safe haven post-arrow where he joined as CTO, Savannah River National Labs, and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, all of whom I suspect are involved in UFO legacy programs. So isn't it interesting that Battelle formed a new LLC under a trio of institutions to manage sites for the Department of Energy? Here we can finally circle back. On 15 September 2004, SAIC entered into a similar venture. Analyzing a Form 10 SEC document, we can see that in 2004 SAIC entered into an agreement with EG&amp;G Technical Services, as well as Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, Inc. to form RDS, Research and Development Solutions, LLC. A now defunct group, RDS was quickly assigned to the Department of Energy's National Energy Technical Laboratory shortly after its founding with a total value of $217 million. Indeed, by 27 September 2004, RDS was securing even more contracts with DOE, with some contracts of up to $41 million. The DOE's National Energy Technical Laboratory's mission is to, quote, advance the national economic and energy security of the United States, end quote. In RDS's founding year, the NETL had a budget of over $900 million, which was used for R&amp;D programs in support of the DOE's offices of fossil energy, energy efficiency and renewable energy and energy assurance, as well as work with other federal agencies. RDS was brought on to, quote, support the management and integration of all stages of science and technological development at NETL, which could lead to commercially viable solutions in the energy area, specific technical services areas to be performed include R&amp;D technology planning and analysis, R&amp;D operations, process engineering design and analysis, computational research simulation and visualization, environment safety and health assurance, and partnership development, end quote. Of course, NETL has no direct connection we can see to UFO legacy programs, but it is interesting that NETL does have connections to three companies ranging from possibly to almost certainly involved in UFO legacy programs. Outside of RDS, SAIC engaged in multiple projects with EG&amp;G, as well as other contractors I suspect engage in UFO exploitation programs, such as L3Harris and Alien Science and Technology, as demonstrated in this 2005 250 million joint war fighting center support contract. If Alien Science and Technology sits on the tip of your tongue, that very well may be because this is a contractor mentioned alongside the testimony of witness Ed. Ed served as a director for an electronics warfare group out of the Edwards 412th Test Wing, which is a major range and test facility base, and claimed to work directly with scientists and test pilots of reverse engineered UFO vehicles. According to Ed, this program operated across the Nevada test and training range, as well as the Edwards 412th Test Wing, Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, Area 51, S4, and underground connective tissue. After his very real time at Edwards, Ed went on to work at the Pentagon for USAF Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel chain, where he claimed dozens of billions of dollars went missing each year in non-TOA or non-transfer of authority funds. During his time at the Pentagon, Ed also joined Alien Science and Technologies in Crystal City, Virginia as an F-35 subject matter expert. I have also guest with the enormous bloated budget of the F-35 program around $2 trillion, this aircraft platform may hide funds for UFO program operations. In a similar venture to RDS LLC by SAIC and EG&amp;G, and Triad National Security LLC under Battelle, in 1999, the same year Northrop Grumman purchased Teledyne Ryan and was engaged in a purchasing spree I have connected to UFO programs, SAIC and Northrop entered a joint venture to create AMSEC LLC. AMSEC grew from $100 million in revenue in 2000 to $500 million in revenue by 2007. Quote, AMSEC contracts primarily with the Navy are expected to gross $500 million next year. AMSEC is jointly owned by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Northrop Grumman, and Science Applications International Corporation. End quote. AMSEC specializes in providing naval architecture and marine engineering, naval ship systems assessments, maintenance engineering, waterfront maintenance support, acquisition program support, shipyard industrial engineering, and C4I installation and support services. AMSEC also provides lifecycle integrated logistics services, including technical manual development, provisioning documentation, spare parts management, training development and delivery, and software development. By the 2010s, AMSEC operated as a major contractor providing engineering and technical services in support of the Navy modernization program. Some AMSEC, IDIQ, or indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts. A contracting method, David Grush has stated support legacy program funding saw 2015 contracts north of $83 million for Naval Surface Warfare Centers for AMSEC. Consider me intrigued here, as I have previously discussed, and as we will discuss later, the testimony of Randy Anderson and SAIC running the Off-World Technologies Division below NSWC Crane in 2012 to 2015. In my projects, when discussing DOD contractors, FFRDCs, and new arcs, I try and single out official reports, internal reports, defense technical intelligence center documents, etc. to attempt to draw parallels to UFO legacy programs. Previous references have included project updates on Project Stork and metallurgical alloy analysis by Battelle. TRW's work on high-speed underground tunnels possibly connecting deep underground military bases. 1972's Project Outgrowth out of the US Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base detailing anti-gravity propulsion and many, many, many more. Of course, seen as it's our subject today, SAIC has their own compelling historical documentation. In 1988, SAIC began work on a report titled Electric Propulsion Study for Edwards Air Force Base's Aeronautics Laboratory in the Air Force Base Technology Center, AFSC. As we've discussed throughout today, viewers of my channel will recall my extremely high conviction regarding a joint UFO-ARV Alien Reproduction Vehicle Program existing between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range. Again, this was covered in great detail on my video on Ed, an electronics warfare test director out of Edwards who claimed to operate this program engaging with UFO legacy program scientists and ARV pilots. This 1988 SAIC document, released August of 1990, was written by SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens and featured extensive contribution from Assistant Director of Los Alamos National Labs Center for Explosive Technology Research, Ferris Williams. This paper discusses the byfield-brown effect. Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs work on highly classified power density devices for the Strategic Defense Initiative and ultimately suggests a five-dimensional approach to unifications of fields for novel propulsion methods. The report also suggests anti-gravity could be achieved by using rotating cylinders filled with mercury and should be considered for oceanic and atmospheric applications. Intriguing to say the least, as this rotating mercury system is the exact propulsion method, USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet claimed originated from reverse engineering out of Sandia in Lawrence Livermore National Labs that powered the TR-3B Alien Reproduction Vehicle. The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field Disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse-engineered MFD and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology. But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you, nor am I. The government will go to any lengths. Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury-based. It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy. The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%. Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity. Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force. Just for consideration, it is also interesting how this Ferris-Williams, mentioned in this report, also spoke at a June 2001 UFO Technology Conference where it was mentioned his research was sponsored by Hal Putoff. This conference was actually held in La Jolla, San Diego with immediate proximity to numerous SAIC locations and their California headquarters. In July of 2018, journalist George Knapp released a leaked version of 38 DIRDS, or Defense Intelligence Reference Documents created under the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or ATIP. ATIP, of course, is the controversial office Lou Elizondo claimed to direct, work for, or operate under in various capacities. Much discussion has been conducted surrounding ATIP versus ASAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program. This is of course not the subject of today's video, and while I maintain ATIP was likely a white world cover for more classified programs under ASAP, we will not be discussing the complexities of ATIP versus ASAP today. On 16 January 2019, the Black Vault received a list of the aforementioned DIRD reports under FOIA. By March 2022, the Black Vault had successfully received copies of all 38 DIRD reports. I have discussed these DIRDS before. The subject matter and topics of them are simply astounding. The DIRDS feature highly scientific and technical reports by various authors that touch on multiple core positions from spatial slash temporal translation to armament. Some of these DIRDS include focus on space-time metric engineering by Hal Putoff, brain-machine interfaces by Dr. R. Genick, pulsed high-power microwave weaponry by Dr. James Wells, and advanced aerospace configurations by Dr. Paul Sizz. And it is interesting how in 2001, Dr. Sizz appeared as a whistleblower on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document. In his tape testimony to Greer, Sizz discussed his eight years in the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and 30 years working for the McDonald-Douglas aircraft company. Sizz discussed its involvement tracking UFOs while at Wright-Patterson, clocked at 20,000 miles per hour, performing unusual and silent maneuvers, as well as his time in classified projects at McDonald-Douglas. Within these DIRDS are numerous papers written by the infamous Dr. Eric Davis, covering such topics as traversable wormholes, stargates, and negative energy, anti-gravity for aerospace applications, and concepts for extracting energy from the quantum vacuum. In a similar vein to these exotic DIRDS, Davis had previously written a mind-boggling report from 2001 to 2003, titled Teleportation Physics Study. If you are somehow unfamiliar with Davis, please check out my project on the Wilson Davis Notes or my interview with Davis on Jesse Michael's channel. Davis wrote teleportation physics study for the Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL, for Air Force Material Command at Edwards Air Force Base. Davis would go on to work at AFRL and would state during the Seoul 2024 Symposium, AFRL was where he uncovered irrefutable evidence of UFO legacy program operations. Teleportation Physics Study devotes an entire report section to p-teleportation, a form of psychokinesis, quote, similar to telekinesis, but generally used to designate the movement of objects through other physical objects over great distances. Telekinesis is a form of p-k, which describes the movement of stationary objects without the use of any known physical force, and p-k is essentially the direct influence of mind-on-matter without any known immediate physical energy or instrumentation, end quote. This p-k phenomenon, p-teleportation section, stated much of the theoretical slash experimental slash operational work on the subject was based off a little known program conducted at SRI International with the NSA. Sponsored at times by the CIA, DIA, and US Army INSCOM that would later relocate to SAIC. This was the infamous remote viewing program, a.k.a. Project Stargate. Well, there was, like, CIA docs about consciousness and, like, weird remote viewing stuff. I mean, besides the Stargate program that were released in the FOIA reading room on CIA's website, too, that are pretty trippy. We're like, wow, CIA's looking into some really interesting stuff. I mean, they're a hardcore intel agency. What's going on there? But it makes sense that they would kind of have to find out if that's p-k. Like, you can't ignore that if you're really doing your job. If your job is intelligence. Like, okay, like, let's look at this. What's an aspect of the phenomenon, because it's like a reach out from the crash retrieval program, like, hey, I need you to look into some weird stuff, because it might be the key unlock for something that we got in a warehouse, you know? Yeah. I speak often on the possibility some non-human vehicles are controlled not with complex control surfaces, but instead with thoughts or cognition. These sentiments have largely and recently been associated with Jake Barber and the discussion of psionics and programs focused on utilizing anomalous cognition to lure in UFO to shoot them down with EMP weaponry. And we came to a conclusion even in those days that the reason most flying saucers have failed is because our conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system. He's part of that saucer. But as we just saw, discussion of UFOs and cognition far predate Barber. The late Colonel Philip J. Corso would claim he and the Army's Foreign Technology Division under Arthur Trudeau were in the early 1960s, tasked with numerous projects for the purpose of seeding and adapting technologies plucked from UFO crash retrievals, specifically Roswell, into the U.S. military industry, if possible. One such project, started in 1961, was focused on, quote, control guidance by brainwaves, end quote. Corso had learned from official Roswell files the biologics on board the crash disk were part of the guidance system. The Foreign Technology Division sought to adapt this technology to allow humans to control ballistic missiles via brainwaves. I've just had one of the most senior scientists in the U.S. Defense Department's former admitted to me that he was read into a UFO crash retrieval program. I've spoken to well over 20 people now. What I was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing, and they are not in a position to be able to engineer it yet, because it's just light years beyond what we have. It's a completely new type of physics, is what one person said to me. And you might be interested in this, Jay, because of the sort of direction that your interests have taken. Without expanding on it, one of the people I spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind-interface connection with the engineering that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or some kind of intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding. Indeed, similar claims can be found within the files of the late legendary Leonard Stringfield. Analyzing Stringfield's notes reveals a conversation with one Mr. Hines, who had a source from Bell Labs. Of course, Bell Labs I've discussed before, as having involvement in UFO legacy programs. Lenn spoke to a Mr. Hines, who had a source from Bell Labs. The informants stated that he was on the flight line at a California Air Force Base in the early 1950s, and saw a UFO retrieval brought in. He allegedly saw a cutaway of the recovered craft, plus the headband transceiver worn by the aliens. Anyone involved with the retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search. Apparently, one man must have kept a part of the craft, and he mysteriously disappeared. He was never seen again. What I can tell you is that people who work on this technology tell me it has no control systems, no control surfaces, no visible propulsion system, no dials, no levers, no buttons. It's a shell. They tell me it's operated by consciousness. Go figure. When analyzing USG's special access programs focused on anomalous mental phenomena, being moved into the secrecy of the corporate world, I can't help but to think of direct parallels to UFO legacy programs. Acknowledged US programs into anomalous cognition began in 1977 with Project Stargate. Project Stargate was a joint secret army, DIA, CIA, and SRI International Contractor Program tasked to investigate the potential for military use of psychic phenomena. The program went by many codenames based on operational agencies within the program. Gondola Wish, Stargate, Sunstreak for the CIA, Grille Flame for INSCOM, Center Lane for the DIA, etc. This was until 1991 when the project would consolidate under the Stargate project and be moved to our subject of today, SAIC. Stargate was initially operated out of Fort Meade, Maryland with a key sponsor of the work being Major General Albert Stubblebine. Stubblebine founded US Army Intelligence and Security Command INSCOM. INSCOM initially commanded the US Special Forces Unit, the ISA, Intelligence Support Activity. The ISA was later on moved to JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command, where I and others like Chris Sharp have accused JSOC elements of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals alongside the CIA Office of Global Access. Stubblebine himself has been accused by numerous individuals such as Philip J. Corso and Stephen Greer of participating directly in UFO material exploitation programs at Fort Wachuka, funding clandestine men-in-black type entities and much more. Stubblebine, according to Greer, is the man who offered Greer $2 billion to absorb Greer's organization, C-SETI, into the general's work. So it is quite intriguing, a general with keen aptitude for anomalous cognition would also be accused of participating in UFO legacy program operations. This reminds me of the quote we just heard from David Grush, but let's focus our work back to SAIC. SAIC would continue Stargate from 1991 to 1994. However, I would wager this work continued long after 1994. SAIC published 10 primary studies focused on remote viewing and sci phenomena. SAIC would coin the terms anomalous cognition, also known as remote viewing or clairvoyance, a quote, form of information transfer in which all known sensorial stimuli are absent. That is, some individuals are able to gain access to information by an as yet unknown process, end quote. As well as anomalous perturbation, aka psychokinesis, a quote, form of interaction with matter in which all known physical mechanisms are absent. That is, some individuals are able to influence matter by an as yet unknown process, end quote. In their official reports, SAIC stated they were and earlier programs were able to verify the existence of anomalous cognition but not able to verify the existence of anomalous perturbation. SAIC would employ agents and beacons for such experiments. Agents displayed a quantitative measurement of displays of anomalous cognition and beacons served as individuals who would engage in direct sensorial stimuli from an intended target to act as a focus of attention for the anomalous cognition receiver. Some pretty incredible stuff I know, and as I have stated before on numerous occasions, I am still myself learning about PSY phenomena in relation to the subject of UFOs. So for now, we will leave SAIC's work into AC and AP, but perhaps we will revisit the subject in the future. But SAIC's possible hidden continuation of Stargate does tie into the last subject we will discuss today. Naval Support Activity Crane, home to one of the nation's most important military laboratories, is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best kept secret, Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana. As I mentioned at the beginning of this video, I have covered the case of Randy Anderson in the Off-World Technologies Division underneath NSWC Crane before. This early investigation was taken down to support Randy's testimony reaching a wider audience on Jesse Michael's platform. With this investigation into SAIC, I thought it prudent to make my investigation into Randy Anderson available again. This is because the overwhelming majority of that investigation was labeling with high confidence SAIC as the contractor in question in charge of a secret division housing recovered technology. So for the full picture, I recommend watching my video to learn more about the data investigation, contractors, military units, and more associated with Randy's story and to hear more from Randy overall, I highly recommend viewing Jesse's video. But let's briefly summarize Randy's experience and tie it into SAIC. In the early to mid-2010s, Randy was sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana for advanced weapons training. Anderson served as a US Army Green Beret, 18 Bravo weapons sergeant, which meant the soldier was a highly trained expert in US and foreign small arms weaponry and explosives. Anderson and his fellow Green Berets were sent to Crane for weapons testing and training courses. However, due to holding a TSSCI clearance, Anderson and one other soldier were shown classified foreign and domestic weapon platforms. These included disruptive technologies such as unique Russian ballistics. But quickly, what is Crane? The Naval Surface Warfare Center, or NSWC, is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane alongside the US Army Ammunition Activity, which stockpiles much of the US mainland's munitions. Crane, Indiana was chosen for these stockpile duties during World War II, as such a landlocked state would have proved to have been difficult to be targeted by enemy forces. NSWC Crane is a massive facility, with several underground layers highlighted as the Premier Navy Lab, whose mission is to quote, provide acquisition and in-service engineering and technical support for sensors, electronics, electronic warfare, and special warfare weapons, end quote. Operations at Crane are divided into three distinct focus areas, strategic missions, electronic warfare, and expeditionary warfare. But this location doesn't focus on conventional missions. As we see from this recent Duke University long-range broad agency announcement, a key focus of Crane's programs is advanced concepts and technologies, end quote. And we discussed some of these advanced concepts and technologies earlier in this project with mention of SAIC and the JTAA. The underground presence of the base is key to mention here. Not only are there numerous underground bunkers for munitions storage hidden below the ground, but also small arms testing resources, such as an underground 100 meter firing range. Now as I mentioned earlier, I'm here at Crane to test advanced foreign and domestic weaponry. The Crane facility has historically worked closely with the U.S. Army for weapons testing, training, and defensive capabilities, such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq. And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering, critical technology to maintain quote unquote fleet readiness, such as an intriguing black box I covered extensively in my first video on Randy Anderson. Best of my knowledge, NSWC Crane is integral to naval UFO legacy programs. Previously, not only did I tie intriguing NSWC Crane contracts to work done on UFO underwater recovery programs operating out of the Navy alongside Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the NRO and the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, but let's also mention that NSWC Crane likely resides in a complex system of naval centers engaged in T-U-O technologies of unknown origin, housing, and exploitation. I know I say this all the time, but this really is another video for another day, as I am still deeply engaged with this research. The thesis I am building here, however, is this. Naval undersea warfare center divisions, such as Keyport, and university affiliated research centers, such as the Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, engage with UFO data. Naval surface warfare centers, such as Crane, engage with T-U-O hardware. And nav-air installations like China Lake and Patuxent River deal with quote-unquote aircraft. This really will be a worthy thread. We will pull on a bit now and more in the future that quite likely has SAIC written all over it. On 5 June 2025, Immaculate Constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown illustrated an enormously impactful tweet that directly referenced UFO materials or craft being stored at the Patuxent River special project hangars that are owned by the Imentum Corporation amongst quote-unquote other fun spaces. Of course, alongside Imentum, SAIC has a significant presence at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, enjoying similarly lucrative contracts to NSWC Crane while majorly supporting PAX River's Naval Air Warfare Center aircraft division and ship and air integration warfare division. Remember how earlier in this project we discussed joint ventures with SAIC and EGNG and SAIC in Northrop, possibly linked to UFO legacy programs? Well, SAIC has engaged in similar practices with Imentum. A contractor Matt Brown has now accused of housing UFO materials at Nav Air PAX River. SAIC and Imentum join forces to form FSA, a contractor that as recently as 2020 has secured IDIQ federal contracts in excess of $1.3 billion. Perhaps in the future we can shed more light on possible joint SAIC Imentum work on UFO legacy programs at major Naval RD-TNE stations. Anyways, after observing prosaic disruptive technologies, Randy and one of his fellow soldiers were taken to a pristine and advanced location under Crane by an unmarked contractor in civilian clothes. Anderson was told by this guide, a private contractor former military, in the same individual leading the weapons training course, quite nonchalantly, they were entering the quote-unquote off-world technologies division. Upon entering, Randy did not enter a normal firing range or laboratory. He and the other men entered what seemed to be a scientific observation room overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology staffed by one other contractor dressed similar to a lab technician. One device Randy witnessed was a sphere no bigger than a basketball that was seemingly constructed from seamless metal. The soldiers were told by their guide this object and the other piece of technology interacted with human consciousness. The other piece of technology was seemingly similar to a type of gauntlet that was according to the contractor considered weapon technology due to the tech producing an energetic discharge during recovery. This weapon was projecting some type of glyphic writing Randy could not distinguish between physical projection or projection into his mind. Shortly after, Randy was escorted out of the off-world technologies division and to this day suffers extensive mental haze and memory problems surrounding this event. But where does SAIC tie into this? The mission of NSWC Crane is to provide the quote American warfighter with solutions to their toughest technical challenges to better equip a decisive advantage in electromagnetic warfare, strategic missions and expeditionary warfare end quote. Crane employs a whopping 2489 contracting force and engages in projects with numerous defense contractors, DOE labs like Sandia National Labs and universities. And also recall as I just mentioned earlier in this project we have already discussed mention of SAIC and many contracts for the JTAA, the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, a key component of Crane that supports the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts. SAIC, one of the DoD's premier science and technology subject matter experts and innovative contractors, aka Washington Shadow, who has better access to the Pentagon than the government's own attorneys, has extensive contracts of interest with NSWC Crane as well as a provable previous interest in consciousness related studies similar to the sphere Randy observed that reportedly only responded to human consciousness. Indeed, right around the time of Randy's encounter, 2012, the Office of Naval Research was seemingly carrying on the legacy of SAIC and Stargate, announcing a revolutionary research study that investigated sixth sense among humans to understand how to train personnel on quote, intuitive decision making, end quote. But like we've been doing in this video, let's follow the money and analyze some contracts. In my project on joint U.S. Navy under C-UFO retrieval programs, I highlighted joint programs operating between the U.S. Navy, the Office of Naval Research, the Office of Naval Intelligence, U.S. Intelligence agencies such as NRO, NRO, NGA, CIA, as well as US SOCOM or Special Operations Command, Defense Contractors, and FFRDC such as the Center for Naval Analysis, MITRE, SAIC, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and Premier U.S. Naval Weapons Facilities such as NSWC Crane and NSWC Chita Lake. In that project, which I highly recommend viewing, I discussed how Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute provided submersibles for under C-UFO crash retrievals for their quote, unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained, end quote. I theorized this work was conducted through SoulSource, IDIQ, and IDIC engineering service contracts between the National Defense Research and Development Services and Woods Hole awarded to Naval Surface Warfare Centers. Examples can be found between Woods Hole and Newit Keyport for the procurement of quote, hardware, materials, and supplies, as well as services to develop, build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support the unmanned undersea vehicle family of systems for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, end quote. Indeed, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute even has historical contracts with SAIC at NSWC Crane, such as this 24 May 2023 contract for quote, research and development of expeditionary systems for Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Weapon System Division JXN, end quote. Crane's JXN, aka Weapon Systems Division, falls under NSWC Crane's JX or Special Warfare and Expeditionary Systems Division. This is the department I previously suspected and still suspect holds the Off-World Technologies Division ran by SAIC. Curiously, there is a 2020 contract of interest here that was deleted from SAIC's website. This $133 million contract awarded to SAIC tasked the corporation to continue to provide mission engineering and integration services to the Maneuver Engagement and Surveillance Systems Division at NSWC Crane. The Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement Division JXW falls parallel to the Weapon Systems Division JXN that sees joint contracts between SAIC, Woods Hole and Crane, both of which fall under the aforementioned Special Warfare and Expeditionary Systems Crane Division. In fact, analyzing this JXW Division brings even more intrigue. Nestled within the Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement branch that sees enormous contracts with SAIC is a subset called JXWT. The Special Capabilities Branch are elements of the Off-World Technologies Division hidden within Crane's Special Capabilities Branch. This 2020 $133 million contract may seem obscene, but SAIC is no stranger to frankly enormous contracts. Earlier in this video, we discussed hundreds of millions of dollars awarded to SAIC for IT consolidation with Sandia National Laboratories. But how about this 2023 contract that also suspiciously vanished from SAIC's website around January of 2024, detailing a $249 million in definite delivery in definite quantity, SAIC contract to support Crane's Weapons Division Instrumentation Platform? These are but a handful of SAIC Crane contracts. Numerous more absolutely enormous contracts exist, such as a 2010 $351 million contract for SAIC to provide technical engineering services to NSWC Crane in support of the Joint Special Operations Response Department which is referencing JSOC. And remember, we've discussed today and as I do in almost every video I link JSOC elements to UFO crash retrieval. Randy claimed the contractors associated with the classified prosaic weapons training took him to the Off-World Technologies Division. We can find even more examples of SAIC conducting weapons testing at Crane. In a now restricted article that was comically pulled after my video on Randy Anderson, SAIC demonstrated extensive technical work providing expertise to improve C4 ISR a.k.a. command control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in weapon systems for the warfighter at NSWC Crane. So if Randy's story is true is SAIC the contractor running the Off-World Technologies Division? Well there is no direct proof but I would wager there is ample evidence SAIC with their demonstrated interest in sigh phenomena engagement with assets I have accused of participating in UFO retrieval operations at Crane and proven history engaging in weapons training at Crane single out SAIC as operating an underground laboratory focused on the housing containment and possible exploitation of non human technology. Anyways, as I said in the beginning of this video I know for SAIC we don't have as many direct connections to UFO programs specifically craft housing and ARV production then we do companies like Northrop like we do Lockheed Morton or even some of Northrop subsidiaries TRW, BDM all the way back to Aerospace etc and then FFRDC's and so on and so forth. But I hope what I showed today is that diving through SAIC's corporate history some of their larger scandals some of their implications in UFO programs that this company has for lack of a better term quite a few skeletons in its closet. Whether this be defrauding the United States Government and intelligence agencies or federal forces like virtual case file with the FBI or the FBI or like project trailblazer with the NSA SAIC seems to have a repeating pattern of securing enormous contracts in either delivering no product underdelivering or underdelivering and asking for more money and as we saw from quotes throughout articles published by Forbes and published by Wall Street Journal in the early 2000s there are numerous numerous numerous occasions on which there are anonymous or named whistleblower complaints against SAIC and of course we saw this with Denise McKenzie as well. And I was really interested to kind of connect Aldrich Saussier and his claims of fraud with the SDI the Strategic Defense Initiative and parallel that to 1992 as well with Denise McKenzie and SAIC as we showed in this video SAIC was pretty much the largest contractor for SDI for quite a few years larger than other companies like Northrop Grumman Lockheed Martin and so forth combined so by extension I think it is safe to assume that some of this fraud and waste occurring in SDI would extend to its largest by an exponential factor contractor now with SAIC probably what everybody thought going into this video was of course Randy Aitterson the Off-World Technologies Division and Project Stargate now I've said so many times and my opinion is really changing on this matter that some of the for lack of a better term psionics or psychic phenomena plural with the UFO programs whether that be cognitively interfacing with a craft in terms of course those claims and some of these beings flying UFOs via mind or via thoughts or headband transceivers some of Leonard Stringfield's notes I have really found Solis in the quote by David Grush on JRE where David Grush talks about Stargate and remote viewing documents in the CIA reading room and other various remote viewing programs or AC or AP some of those terms coined by SAIC and I really found Solis and Grush saying to Joe when Joe kind of retorts back well of course the CIA would be looking to gain every single leverage into intelligence gathering whether that be a legitimate source or not that David Grush says well maybe some of these programs spawned out of a need to try and unlock something we have in a warehouse somewhere I think that is an extremely interesting quote and that directly kind of corresponds to the story of Randy Anderson in the Off World Technologies division where some of this this sphere that he saw was claimed to interact with human consciousness and how the contractors at NSWC Crane which is most likely and I still maintain and I still maintain even stronger SAIC and I also think it's interesting the larger SAIC connection to some of the larger naval air stations or naval surface warfare centers across the nation I'm intrigued to really dive in more about Matt Brown statements about Patuxent River and the Amentum hangers and explore more of SAIC at Patuxent River maybe NSWC Dolgren, China Lake, etc as well as their work with Amentum now looking into the corporate of SAIC I know it's quite convoluted especially when we got into the decision science applications and then that long road of DSAI going into DSA to Stephen Myers to L3 communications to Engility to being bought up by SAIC and L3 airs I know that's crazy complicated I was really interested to find sort of similar to Triad National Security with Battelle and two universities that SAIC engaged in similar practices and this was with their RDS with EG&amp;G now of course the LLC went defunct within a couple years but similar to Triad this was a crack to break into DOE lab work and Department of Energy classified work but I think one of the most tangible things we have from today's video some of the most tangible research is of course the SAIC whistleblowers I do not need to say more about Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick I'm sure by the time this video comes out there will be a lot of stink about the Wall Street Journal article and maybe even we'll get that part too soon so I'd like to see more of more of basically a hero worship tale to Sean Kirkpatrick and his great work but I'd also like to ask if Kona Blue was just a project tricking all Air Force personnel what about the circular reporting those two seem at odds with each other from Kirkpatrick's claims but anyway I digress I do believe we stumbled upon some other high-level SAIC gatekeepers and possibly individuals that need to be subpoenaed by Congress of course most of these individuals are ceased but some are still living these gatekeeper individuals include John M. Deutch, William J. Perry Admiral Ray Bourne Admiral Owens and Donald Kerr I'd say of all of these individuals Donald Kerr's CV has the greatest greatest CV and greatest work history that would lend to UFO legacy programs this being CIA, DS&amp;T SAIC NRO, the MITRE Corporation etc. I'd be real interested to hear from more about Don Kerr's work in legacy program operations and gosh I'd be really interested to speak to Oki Shannon as well of course we saw in the ATP notes from 85 we see look to Don Kerr for influence and money and earlier in those notes I didn't include this in the video there's Don K slash dash ET with a couple other names now is this Don Kerr most likely and why ET was there other information spoken about Don Kerr at this advanced theoretical physics working group at BDM's facility in McLean, Virginia that was held one year after Stubblebine joined BDM I would certainly like to know more and also I know I said earlier in the video that I have found Denise McKenzie in attempted to main contact I've heard nothing yet I'd really like to speak to her to learn more I've also found Mr. Stuart Stanley and I've tried to reach out to him nothing yet either so kind of the running theme with this video and as we said in the beginning SAIC has really seemed to stay in the shadows why that is I think they've really maintained a lower profile than companies like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and maintained a lower profile than even some of the other low profile guys like DNA, like Rand etc so I hope if anything this video just brings to light some of the involvement of SAIC and not only just do a full legacy programs but also black budget operations and some secretive work I mean SAIC from its inception being staffed with high level individuals such as Bobby Ray Inman has had numerous numerous high level intelligence and military individuals the way this has been explained to me in the past as some individuals who work in UFO legacy programs within the DOD or IC they'll trade in their stripes and stars for a pinstripe suit and essentially these guys will go from working on UFO legacy programs within official United States government and DOD avenues and intelligence avenues to doing the same thing on a corporate payroll and you'd imagine with a lot of these gatekeepers we talked about Sean Kirkpatrick included a lot of these guys would either go on to work at SAIC after service in the U.S. DOD or IC or before worked in SAIC this reminds me of John Doichu before he joined the joined us DepsecDef and spearheaded SAPOC SRG and SAPOC itself he was already on the board of SAIC and already working with TRW and how about that I know in the Northrop video we talked quite a bit about TRW TRW was of course purchased by Lockheed Martin in the early 2000s and another connection to the Wilson Davis notes TRW had also been kind of convicted and pursued legally for overcharging on space systems on space projects by the U.S. DOD in the early 90s and in that Northrop project I kind of tied that together with some of the near out auditing that almost found out some of the DOD UAP legacy programs so that's interesting as well that so many of these individuals also have connections to TRW of course with TRW have the old Zodiac story and so forth by pseudonym Sedgemasters Richard Dolan's done some incredible work on that I'd love to work with him someday to revisit Zodiac but I'll leave my rant there I do hope again that this is a springboard for more research into SAIC UFO legacy programs I would like to hear more stories of ARV and SAIC tied together and I would like to hear more material exploitation programs and craft housing because I'm going to say this in the end of my videos every time if you are an individual who has had experience first hand or have second hand knowledge on UFO legacy programs this be crash retrieval or material exploitation please email me at UAPGIRB at protonmail.com I've switched away from a Gmail account

With the Immaculate Constellation report, at least SOME equilateral and isosceles triangle craft have been identified as reproduction and Alien Reproduction Vehicles. </p> <p>Numerous sightings and whistleblower testimony have lent evidence to the thesis DOD and private contractors have operated reverse-engineered triangular craft out of key military bases since at least the 1980s.

Unlike classic flying saucers, orbs, egg-shaped craft, tic-tacs, and strange organic shapes like the controversial jellyfish UAP, triangles have historically not been associated with non-human intelligence, but instead, with deep-sixed, black-budget human reverse engineering efforts. This is somewhat due to triangular craft lacking many of the hallmarks of what some would consider NHI craft. No visible means of propulsion, a lack of harsh angles and surface features, missing rivets, bolts, and seams, as well as many triangular sightings occurring in concentrated periods over populated regions and military bases. Triangle craft were further touched upon in the fall 2024 UAP hearings, in which the shadowy, unacknowledged special access program, Immaculate Constellation, saw its public report released to Congress and the American people. At least some of the triangles among the rarest UAP configurations reported in the Immaculate Constellation report have been confirmed by the USAP to be ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicles, the same term used by presiding program members to label the Fluxliner Flying Saucer Reproduction Vehicle observed by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show. And Representative Eric Burleson told me this was not the first time, in fact, he had heard the term ARV. And I've seen and listened some, and had conversations about this with people from the UFO community that will say that there's two types of aircraft there is, there's crap that is truly extraterrestrial and then there's crap that we have reverse engineered and created and for reproduced, right? And so that report, what is unique about the Immaculate Constellation report is it's about these reproduced, you know, basically us reproducing what is crashed. But are these triangles whose descriptions are often time near identical indeed human made? What can we make of the whistleblower testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who described these craft in great detail, including a name, the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B? What valuable evidence can we gather from slightly different triangle variations seen from the 1980s and 1990s? And why would the X-Files TV show contract a triangle designed from an artist who drew an alleged reverse engineered craft called the XF-131 Super Sentinel, instructed by two Lockheed Martin and two Northrop Grumman engineers? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me on another investigation into alien reproduction vehicle. This time focusing on the black triangle seen throughout the globe for decades, let's venture into the full story of the TR3B ARV, a possible parallel joint Northrop and Lockheed ARV hailing from the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale Plan, and strange possible ARV prototypes seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s with odd features. Let us investigate the origins, configurations, and purposes of these craft allegedly built from NHI technology. On November 13, 2024, the term ARV was entered into the Congressional Hearing Record with the Immaculate Constellation Report. No, this term did not originate with Stephen Greer in 2001. It can indeed be traced back to 1988 with alleged first-hand witness Brad Sorensen, who observed DOD and private industry attempts to reverse engineer anti-gravity flying saucer craft. And now, the Immaculate Constellation Unknown Anonymous Whistleblower Report has labeled another craft configuration as alien reproduction vehicles, the triangle. The report whose historical data tracked back to 2009 discussed a large, equilateral triangle directly appearing over intelligence-collecting vessels. Captured by Indo-PACCOM, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the triangle hovered and rotated slowly 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean. Three bright points were seen at each bottom corner of the horizontally rotating triangle with the horizontal bar of sweeping lights partially observed. Collected intelligence revealed this triangle was a reproduction craft. A second Indo-PACCOM entry detailed a fighter jet-sized, equilateral ARV triangle of unknown origin hovering less than 200 meters above a vessel. At least two lights were observed on the craft with at least one more obstructed on the underside of the craft with the triangle slightly positioned at an upward angle. In their 2023 and 2024 historical reports arrow-listed triangles as solely 3-4% of all reported UAPs. A morphology that is indeed quite uncommon. Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO Investigation Program from 1952 to 1969, catalogued over 12,000 cases of varying quality. Let's reference this paper titled The Blue Book Unknowns by Don Berliner, which utilizes numerous criteria to analyze only the most unexplained of Blue Book cases. In the 1950s, we find solely four recorded anomalous triangle sightings. These triangles are often described as colorful. A far cry from our dark gray, black craft with three lights, the subject of today's analysis. Although Arrow and Blue Book are not necessarily trustworthy, we can form a strong observation here. Analyzing historical UFO reporting trends, thank you to UFOsearch.com and Richard Geldreich. We can directly observe the time period of 1940 to 1970 and 2000 to modern day see few triangular craft sightings reported. 1970 to 2000, particularly the 1980s and 1990s, see an overwhelming number of reported triangular UFO sightings. Not only does this confirm the data and claims made further in this video, but this also suggests a worldwide multi-decade UFO flap of triangle-shaped craft. With the cases and testimony we will explore in this video, a strong thesis could be constructed. That sometime in the 1970s, legacy UFO programs began constructing triangular alien reproduction vehicles based on non-human triangular craft and iterated on and tested such craft over military bases during the 1980s to 2000s. And let's also reference the controversial Majestic 12 document titled Somme 101, or the Special Operations Manual I covered at length with Ryan Wood. In the description of craft from this document allegedly dated 1954, we can find description of triangular-shaped craft amongst the saucers, spheres, cigars, etc. The triangles read, quote, This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of observations. Radar indicates Nysosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed to be capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to types A and C. In the midst of a slew of anonymous triangular sightings with strange lights and fixtures in the 1980s and 1990s, which we will discuss later, the 1989 Belgian UFO wave arose. All too often associated with the Patrick M. Hoekst photograph are labeled a case of mass delusion. The Belgian Triangle UFO wave has incredible amounts of worthwhile investigation. The wave is not the subject of today's video, but let's briefly discuss. In November of 1989, hundreds of reports surfaced from Belgium of a large, flat, triangular-shaped craft with lights underneath flying at low altitudes. The event culminated on the night of March 30th, 1990, where an unknown object was tracked by radar and pursued by two Belgian F-16 fighters who were unable to locate the triangle. Internal DOD documents once classified revealed U.S. authorities investigated the case and even confirmed to the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of Defense that no USAF stealth aircraft such as the B-2 or F-117 were used in the region. But what if this wave of sightings strangely caught on radar on March 30th, 1990 was a series of tests over an allied nation of a stealth craft even more secret than the B-2 and F-117? What if this aircraft program was deep-sixed and embedded within special-access programs, within reach of only those with need-to-know access in the highest clearances the US had to offer? What if this craft was the TR-3B reverse-engineered triangle? In at least three of my projects, I have mentioned the testimony of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet and his claims of anti-gravity reverse-engineered triangular craft called TR-3B. Black budget operations involving Nellis-slash-Area-51 and Edwards Air Force Base, an involvement of contractors such as Lockheed Martin in non-human intelligence technology exploitation. Well, now is finally the time to explore his entire testimony. Edgar Albert Fouchet, sometimes referred to as Edgar Rothschild Fouchet, was born in 1948 in South Central Georgia to fifth-generation Americans. His family history consisted of numerous individuals in military intelligence and classified projects. During the Vietnam conflict while attending college, Fouchet worked as a machinist making bombs. In 1968, the young man was drafted into USAF for para-rescue basic training. After fracturing his ankle at Fort Benning, Edgar completed training in electronics, communication, intelligence, and cryptological methods. From 64 to 74, Fouchet was stationed at myriad tactical air command and air training command bases, including 3.5 years stationed in Vietnam and surrounding Asian bases. Within USAF, Fouchet earned degrees in electronics and avionics engineering, as well as a bachelor's in business and enjoyed numerous awards and a prestigious reputation for his advanced skillset often sought after by military brass. In the late 1970s, Fouchet would see a series of USAF-mandated stations at the now infamous Groom Lake Area 51 facility with a top-secret clearance with crypto access. Fouchet was considered an Air Force expert with classified electronic countermeasure test equipment, cryptological test equipment, and automatic test equipment. All while receiving around 4,000 hours of technical training from USG and DOD, half of which was classified. Late in his career working eight years as a defense contractor and engineering manager, Fouchet dealt with classified black programs developing state-of-the-art electronics, logistics, and technical data and automatic testing equipment. The master sergeant participated as a hand-picked key member to work on USAF fighters such as the F-15 Eagle Air Superiority Fighter, the A-10 Warthog, the P-1 Lancer Bomber, and the F-117A stealth fighter. Fouchet claimed to have worked alongside the Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979, which he stated was a minimum 10-story underground facility between Area 51 Groom Lake. Fouchet was recruited to Groom Lake out of his station at Edwards Air Force Base Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which he claimed also consisted of deep underground facilities. The Defense Advanced Research Center, DARCE, not to be confused with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency was actually a proposed institution. Let's reference this declassified Advanced Project Research Agency, DARPA, a lot of acronyms I know, study written in 1973. This study was written as a historical evaluation of the R&amp;D Management Institution, DARPA, who at this time had established remarkably little in the way of official record or institutional memory. On page 82 of the document under DARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects, we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was considered for transfer into the Defense Advanced Research Center, linking the department to the aforementioned Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist and Operation Paperclip transfer, Werner von Braun. Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry Hermann Oberth, who performed extensive study on UFOs. But back to Fuchet, it was here at DARCE he would work with advanced digital technologies and gain knowledge of human-made reverse engineered craft. Master Sergeant Edgar Fuchet made his first public disclosures regarding reverse engineered anti-gravity triangular craft called TR-3B in his 1998 book, Alien Rapture, and presented this data for MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network in IUFO-C, the International UFO Congress after years of interviews, research, and preparation. These disclosures were sourced from five close friends within DOD and classified programs, as well as Fuchet's first-hand experience at Area 51 Groom Lake in the DARC. We will focus mostly on his 1998 IUFO-C presentation, as it serves as an extremely comprehensive baseline summary of Fuchet's testimony, while also pulling clips and contextually relevant data from other sources and Fuchet interviews. His book, Alien Rapture, is extremely similar to Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge, where alleged non-fiction events are shrouded in a guise of fiction to protect names, dates, and locations. Fuchet's 1998 testimony revolved around the revelations of secret government technology and reverse engineered extraterrestrial artifacts. Edgar set out with the specific goal of informing the public on the facts behind the infamously-cited flying triangles. Before I'm through, you'll know exactly what the flying triangle is, the one that's been sighted around the world. It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built, and maybe stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium, or your city. And we must note, outside of his own personal sightings of the craft while in service, Fuchet did not work on the TR-3B. He relayed much of the data he gathered around the TR-3B from his five close sources. Let's discuss these five close sources who build much of the foundation for Fuchet's disclosures. Edgar's closest ally was Gerald, a former National Security Agency investigator and TREAT team member. TREAT stands for the Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team, a.k.a. what we might call the Men in Black. I can find only one publicly available mention of TREAT, and this is from Lichtenstein's Crown Prince Hans Adams in a letter to Dr. Stephen Greer dated August 31, 1997. This letter from an unknown sender discusses Hans Adams in his mention in a book by author Tom Bowers called Nazi Gold. Hans had previously spoken and collaborated with Greer on UAP issues to an unknown degree. This sender accused the Crown Prince of having supported counterintelligence operations against the American people on the subject of UFOs, and in this letter, the sender directly accused Hans Adams of funding TREAT. Adams' funding should be focused on his support for TREAT and its Grand Dom, who is wed to a former U.S. Army General, ex-head of Army Intelligence and Security Command, end quote. The general in question here is U.S. Army General and founder of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM, Albert Stubblebein. Now, I have good reason to believe Army INSCOM is likely associated with UFO crash retrievals, but we will discuss this in a future project. Major General Albert Stubblebein himself allegedly intimidated Stephen Greer to discontinue investigating UFO Black projects. And the level of corruption is worrisome. Now, in 92, General Albert Stubblebein III, Bert, who had been head of Special Forces and Army Intelligence, Fort Wachuka, he intercepted me after we had this major contact event out in Florida and near Pensacola. And he subsequently, about a month later, personally offered me $2 billion to not pursue what I was doing and become part of his team. And Stubblebein is currently witness 10658 in Greer's witness log. His witness description reads, quote, has been involved since the 1960s, former head of Fort Wachuka Army Intelligence, where ET craft and bodies are stored, end quote. What we can learn here is that quite possibly, TREAT is the real life men in black housed within U.S. Army INSCOM. OK, but back to Fouchet and the first of the five disclosure advocates and team members, Gerald. TREAT stands for Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team. I think some of you call me in in black. They work for the Department of Energy and the National Security Agency. This was his cover, but ultimately the National Security Agency controlled all his movements and everything he did. His job required him to watch employees with top secret and cue clearances and other classified clearances at the Nevada Test Site, the Nellis Range, Los Alamos, Sandia, and many other bases. He spent a lot of time out at Area 51 for years before I even knew what he was involved in. This where the previously the most classified aerospace testing in the world took place. You may know it as Groom Lake, Watertown, the Ranch, or Greenland. He was found dead of a heart attack a year after our last meeting. The second individual, Sal, worked directly with the National Security Agency with Electronics Intelligence and became a defense contractor upon his retirement. Sal worked for the company that created the TR-3B gravity disruption device called the Magnetic Field Disruptor, more on this later. The third friend, Doc, was an SR-71 spy plane pilot and USAF test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base. Those who have watched my reverse engineering project at Edwards video will immediately recognize the importance of Edwards and the 412th test group comprising the Edwards test pilot school. If you haven't, I recommend watching that, but we'll explain more during Fouch\u00e9's testimony. The fourth friend, Dell, served with Fouch\u00e9 during Vietnam. Dell's father worked for the NSA for over 25 years and sent Fouch\u00e9 a host of Majestic 12 documents. The fifth member, Rand Budd, was a DOD contractor electronics engineer who worked on top secret R&amp;D programs with electronic countermeasures. The men were perturbed by the fact each had been privy to unusual phenomena, extremely advanced technology, and unidentified aerial vehicles that had not been reported. As we sat at a table in a dark corner of the Silver Dollar Saloon in Las Vegas, discussing our experiences and swapping knowledge, each of the group of five assured me that they trusted me enough to write about their secrets and protect them. We agreed to get together the next year with an understanding that I would contact each of them and set up the meeting. In the meantime, I wrote down all of our notes and their input and their context from other friends about unusual phenomena and their personal sightings. Many of the things the group revealed to me were startling, even to me who had worked 25 years on black programs. But before we continue, let's walk things back and get to know Fouch\u00e9 and his station in black programs a little bit better. In 1979, after working at Nellis with top secret crypto access clearance, Fouch\u00e9 received a request for temporary reassignment to a place with no name. Fouch\u00e9's commanding officer had no idea where he was going, who he would be working with, or what he would be working on. And while we're here, let's take a longer look at this document obtained via FOIA, discussing a promotional recommendation for Fouch\u00e9. Fouch\u00e9 was assigned to Detachment 3, AFFTC, which is the Air Force Flight Test Center Detachment from Edwards Air Force Base that runs operations at Area 51 Groom Lake. Remember how witness Ed stated he was read into UAP programs at Nellis and Area 51 S4 before moving on to become a test director of reverse engineered craft at Edwards. Edgar left on a Monday morning at 4.30 a.m. and boarded a dark blue USAF bus with blacked out windows. 28 other people sat on the bus, not including two security policemen. All personnel were ordered not to speak to one another. After several hours, the bus came to rest and Fouch\u00e9 knew immediately where he was, Groom Lake, Area 51. According to the Master Sergeant, the top secret SR-75, SR-74, and TR-3B operated out of Groom Lake and have historically been misidentified as UFOs. Upon reaching Groom Lake, the bus entered a hangar and the doors were shut. Security personnel checked in Fouch\u00e9 and the others. He was given a pair of heavy glasses, similar to welder's goggles, that obscured his peripheral vision and restricted vision to within 30 feet. For the next 10 consecutive days and further on follow-up visits, Fouch\u00e9's routine was the same. Leave Nellis before sunrise and return to Nellis after dark. Fouch\u00e9 would write down everything he saw and heard at Groom Lake, including hearing topics discussed such as pulse detonation, cyclotronic radiation, quantum flux, transduction field generators, quasi-crystal energy lenses, and EPR quantum receivers. Pulse detonation may remind you of the Aurora Pulsar craft seen by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show. I'm not going to talk about quasi-crystals. I'll make a prediction. Quasi-crystals is the key to everything you want to ever know about how they got here. That's all I'm going to say about it now, except one of the quasi-crystals is the hydrogen crystal. His station at Groom Lake is also where Fouch\u00e9 would meet TREAT, aka Men in Black Agent, Gerald. According to Fouch\u00e9, on Area 51 is the super-secret laboratory named the Defense Advanced Research Center, of which we can only find one official mention. DARS consists of 10 underground stories next to a mountain near Papouse Lake south of Groom Lake and is nestled next to a hangar in the side of a mountain, which stores the TR-3B reverse-engineered craft. The DARS's objectives were fully realized in the mid-1980s, according to Fouch\u00e9, when it was bolstered with SDI money under the Reagan administration. Viewers of my channel will recall multiple times in which I have discussed sources commenting on the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI under Reagan, serving a secondary purpose to protect the U.S. mainland from ballistic missiles. This secondary purpose being the detection of and offensive capabilities against UAP. Fouch\u00e9 claimed his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding was siphoned off to support USAF Black Program starting in 1982. First-hand ARV witness Brad Sorensen was additionally told in 1988, by the men in charge of the ARV exhibit, they were requesting funding to build more of these reverse-engineered craft. The Reagan admin placed extreme importance on the building of ARVs. Shockingly, Fouch\u00e9 stated Defense Contractor EG&amp;G not only provided classified R&amp;D for Black projects, technical and scientific support for nuclear and energy R&amp;D, but also EG&amp;G built these hidden bunkers, mountain hangars, and vast underground facilities at Groom Lake, Papouse, and Mercury for the government, housing facilities such as DARS. The mention of these facilities ties into the topic of DUMMS, deep underground military bases, which I will explore in the future. Alongside EG&amp;G, the RAND Corporation more than likely has a hand here. Edgar would also claim he gathered knowledge EG&amp;G was awarded an indefinite contract for Project Red Light to support the Department of Energy and Military. This contract gave them responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified government and military sites. One's mind may be drawn here to the Nuclear Emergency Support Team supported by EG&amp;G, but Project Red Light was also relayed to Leonard Stringfield in his crash retrieval status reports by a witness claiming the project served to test NHI and reverse engineered craft on the Nellis test range after the craft had been shipped from Edwards Air Force Base. Sources of the Master Sergeant claimed as of 1992 the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to so many public eyes on Area 51. This would see the majority of exotic aircraft platforms relocated to Utah, likely Dugway Proving Grounds, Colorado, Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia and south of Area 51 to S-4. But at Papoose where they store one of the TR-3Bs and they maintain these as their depot, it's built into the side of a mountain cut out of stone. They have a holographic generator that generates the side of the mountain and when you're 10 feet from the side of this mountain and looking into the hangar you can always see a mountain. And that's why when the Russian satellites fly over to verify the salt treaty, when they're infrared and other spectral scanners shoot down at groom, they only see stone because that's all that's there. Just before the state of 1992, there is strangely enough evidence to show a heavy focus on strange exotic aircraft programs out of Area 51, possibly UFO related. In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least eight black programs flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional technologies. A source Goodall knew for 12 years was stationed at Groom Lake and explained that UAP positively exist at the base while another source of his stated quote, we have things out there that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies and quote, and now we finally get into a full body description of the TR-3B craft. Finally, I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B. A friend of mine said he had never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom. The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers. This craft, the most classified aerospace development program in existence at the time, codename Astra, advanced stealth technology reconnaissance aircraft, saw 200 feet diameter testing models and three and 600 feet diameter operational models. The tactical reconnaissance TR-3B operated as the most exotic model under the Aurora program, according to Fouch\u00e9, the same program umbrella that oversaw the pulse detonation UAV Pulsar craft observed by Brad Sorensen. And we may have some clues regarding this family of Aurora craft in previous DoD budgets. In DoD procurement programs, we can find an Aurora project the DoD planned to spend $80 million on in fiscal year 86 and $2.3 billion on in fiscal year 87. This 25 times increase in spending is enormous and at the time was double the cost of the B2 Spirit Bomber program. The Aurora program may have included the reverse engineered TR-3B Lockheed Pulsar as seen by Sorensen and a little known craft titled the SR-33A introduced by Dr. Michael Wolfe, an alleged UAP consultant to the National Security Council special subcommittee. Similar to TR-3B and Pulsar, the SR-33A allegedly utilized conventional fuel and anti-gravity field propulsion systems to operate under a secret space program. The first flight ready operational model of TR-3B occurred in the early 1990s built through SDI and black budget monies. By 1994, at least three of the billion dollar plus operational models were flying. But Fouchet had seen the prototype model or a different model three times previously far before 1994. And according to his sources, there were numerous prototypes with the first anti-gravity warping craft flying in the early 1970s. Not only did he claim to have seen photographs of TR-3B from a C-130 flying mission support for the reverse engineered craft, but Fouchet also claimed to have observed the triangles one night in 1975 high in the atmosphere over Edwards Air Force Base as well as 1976 within the southern part of Nellis Range and lastly in 1979 at Groom Lake. This prototype model looked fairly similar to Fouchet's official model, but with different engines on the tip and no rotable crew compartment. I do recommend checking out part six of author Andrew Johnson's interviews with Fouchet to hear more about his sightings. For the interest of time, I will not show these long clips here. But let's hear about more aspects of the TR-3B Fouchet learned from sources within black programs and his five disclosure comrades and then discuss how the propulsion and engineering system allegedly functioned. According to these sources, the original TR-3B craft design was reverse engineered by Sandia National Labs in Livermore laboratories from a non-human intelligence crash recovery from an unknown date or location. Sandia may be familiar to some as the laboratory nestled within Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico has been often historically implicated with UFO material recovery. Seeing numerous mentions within the MJ-12 documents such as the Eisenhower briefing document and interplanetary phenomenon unit reports. Livermore Labs now called Lawrence Livermore is one of three national security enterprise FFRDCs, federally funded research and development centers sponsored by the DOE to support U.S. nuclear deterrence. The other two locations are Los Alamos National Labs and of course, Sandia. I myself have been told alongside UARC's university affiliated research centers, FFRDCs are semi-private institutions that serve to operate alongside DOD and corporate legacy programs for material exploitation, reverse engineering, etc. Other FFRDCs include Oak Ridge National Laboratory owned by Battelle where our good friend Sean Kirkpatrick ran off to after Aero as well as numerous institutions run by the MITRE Corporation and RAND Corporation. MITRE and RAND will receive their own projects in the near future as I believe these semi-private institutions are integral corporations involved in legacy programs. Those unfamiliar with UARC just need to look back at my work on the 1965 Kecksburg crash. Dr. Eric A. Walker, president of Penn State, self-admitted he oversaw the Kecksburg crash site. Walker had also previously set up Penn State's UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory at the behest of the U.S. Navy. And let's not forget, as of 2024, the untrustworthy Aero under new leadership of Dr. Koslowski admitted Aero, a likely whistleblower honeypot with contracts with Sandcorp, a company built to prevent whistleblower leaks. Stated Aero works alongside UARC and FFRDC. Sure, right now, most of our collaborations that are bearing towards academia are with UARC, university-affiliated research centers associated with universities or with FFRDCs. All this is to say, Fuchet's accusations that Sandia and Lawrence reverse-engineered NHI craft is a sober and rational statement. Edgar would also state the TR3B program was managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA, and the craft was built primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan, and a number of other defense contractors to keep R&amp;D compartmentalized. There is a lot to break down here. One, due to the excellent work of Chris Sharp and an upcoming interview that I have with Dr. Eric Davis, yes, of the Wilson Davis memo, we can implicate the CIA directorate of science and technology with support agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office, National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and likely the National Security Agency as leading teams behind UFO crash retrievals. Fuchet mentioning Lockheed Martin needs no further explanation. I do recommend checking out both my Mark McCandless video and Lockheed Martin investigation. Find them in the video description. Now, Boeing is indeed an interesting mention. Director of Edward's 412th Electronic Warfare Group, ED, stated he worked alongside Boeing and Lockheed on reverse-engineered craft systems at the Nellis Range. Boeing will additionally receive a video of its own, but for now let's reference a fascinating 2013 project by stealth aircraft researcher John Joseph. Joseph claims Boeing served as the primary contractor in Project Brilliant, an SDI program with the goal of setting up an electromagnetic shield around the U.S. using a boomerang-shaped craft that could loiter over cities. Northrop Grumman has as much as Lockheed Martin been historically implicated with the creation of TR-3B. Let's hold off on discussing them for now, as later I would like to tackle a possible triangle variant constructed by Northrop Grumman. Fuchet knew the TR-3B housed a crew of four and served as logistics support and transport for a secret space command. These pilots were top graduates of Navy and USAF test pilot schools, mainly out of the Edwards 412th Test School. Edwards Witness ED additionally made these same claims. The craft employed two nuclear reactors, was comprised of advanced composites, metal materials, and titanium, and employed variable-vectored intake and thrusters on the edges, and advanced multi-mode propulsion engines on each tip of the triangle. The triangle has three lights on each tip, a large diffuse light on the bottom center due to the MFD drive, and featured almost no sound but a magnetic humming. The TR-3B outer coating was reactive to electrical radar stimulation and can change reflectiveness radar absorption. Fuchet described the outer skin-slash panels as electrochromatic, which would camouflage the craft for daytime stealth operations. But let's further dive into the propulsion system from Edgar's own words. The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring, called the Magnetic Field Disruptor, surrounds a rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse-engineered MFD, and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology. But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you. Nor am I. The government will go at any lengths. Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury-based. It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy. The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%. Do not misunderstand. This is not anti-gravity. Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force. The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator, such as the crew compartment, avionics, MFD systems, fuels, environmental systems, and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%. This causes the effect of making an aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed, except, of course, those we didn't build. TR-3B is a high-altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time. Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude. With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally. So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns, obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn. It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance. For those that have seen it, that's how they do it. TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform. The multi-mode propulsion system can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor, and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion, and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion. A key component of TR-3B propulsion as described by Fouchet states its MFD technology built from reversed engineered UAP is not anti-gravity necessarily. Anti-gravity by definition provides a propulsive force that can be used for propulsion. MFD creates a quote-unquote disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon the mass within the circular accelerator. Such systems leveraged from non-human technology may indeed be present and highly secret but acknowledged to aircraft systems. One such example may be the Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber. UFO researchers such as Dr. Richard Boylan have reported three star generals and retired USAF Colonel Donald Ware have disclosed the B-2 carry's onboard electro-gravitic systems to cause internal mass reduction on the wings and fuselage of the craft, which directly leads to the over $1 billion price tag for each craft. The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye? Aviation Week Space Technology March 9, 1992 had a very interesting article from people who worked at Northrop who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2 program was not being trickled down to the public industry. They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross-signature, that's what you see in this diagram right here, and then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature. This is the same type of electro-gravitic technology that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s, so this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought. And before we move on, remember earlier when Edgar Fouchet mentioned ASTRA, Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft, served as the codename for TR-3B? Well, we may in fact have a crash retrieval of this craft. In Ryan Wood's masterpiece Magic Eyes Only, we can find a case dated September 26, 1994 from Bosscom Down, England. This case file references a publication from the November 1994 edition of Air Force Monthly, which discusses an unusual crash landing on the runway of the UK government's highly secret Bosscom Down facility. Rumors quickly circulated the crash was of a flying triangle seen by UFO witnesses for decades. The Air Force Monthly article reads, Shortly after the crash, an unmarked civilian registered CIA operated, Boeing 737 and a similarly anonymous DC-8, visited and two days later the wreck was loaded onto a CC-5 Galaxy and flown to Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, California. The secrecy surrounding the incident has led to speculation that the aircraft involved was a TR-3A, the existence of which the US government has yet to officially acknowledge. While this publication mentions the crash of a TR-3A, and Fuchet does indeed state the TR-3A exists, but is remarkably different from TR-3B, it's worth noting quite often in the public realm, TR-3A and TR-3B are often used almost interchangeably, so perhaps this crash case is referencing TR-3B. And this distinction is key to explore further, as terminology around TR-3A is quite confusing. Quite often I have seen the TR-3A referred to as the pumpkin seed, a craft utilizing pulse detonation engines, the same unmanned craft Brad Sorensen saw in 1988. While other sources refer to TR-3A as a delta-shaped fighter featuring a cockpit, pulse detonation engines, and electro-gravitics for internal mass reduction are complementary field propulsion for high speeds. But while exploring this A and B distinction under co-name Astra, there is a fascinating tangent I want to cover. Let's reference Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley, an extremely famous science fiction novel in the UFO community that fuses the imagination of DeLonge with actual events obtained from U.S. military and government sources, a literary device known as a Romana clay. Facts in this book were allegedly given to DeLonge by advisors such as the commander of the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, multiple Lockheed Martin Skunkworks officials such as Eric Schrock and others. This excellent book makes numerous mentions to an astro-black triangle reverse engineered craft, quote, The craft itself, according to its data manual, was triangular and was named the Astra-3B, but we just call it the Locust, said Beaker with a smile. He was proud to be connected to it. The Locust had control layouts unlike those used in any aircraft he had ever seen. Controls that were not just familiar, but counter-intuitive to anyone with a basic sense of aviation or aerospace physics, end quote. But what I really want to draw attention to here is the description of the Astra's control mechanism. When characters in the film operate the Astra-3B Locust, the pilot's chair looked disappointingly like that from an F-16, but on the left armrest of the pilot's seat sat a red sphere sitting in a cradle, quote, Alan turned the sphere under his hand and the craft rotated cleanly, too cleanly in the air. He then applied a little thrust and was moving. The landmarks of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, zipping past them in a blur. He pursed his lips. State of the art it may be, but it didn't feel like flight. No aircraft could pivot on a dime like he had just done, end quote. Quote. He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on his armrest. He rolled it gently in the Locust pivoted in place. Quote. He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on the armrest. He rolled it gently in the Locust pivoted in place. He did it again, applying a little thrust with his other hand, and the ship changed direction again, leaping hard to the west and then climbing in a dizzying spiral before screaming back to the southeast. Of course, there was no screaming, except perhaps inside Alan's head, as the laws of physics seemed to implode with each movement the craft made. No sound, no torque, no g-force, no inertia, end quote. Now, of course, this passage material is interesting, but why do I bring this up? Well, because the control scheme in this is the exact same sphere mechanism primary witness Brad Sorenson and aerospace illustrator Mark McCandless claimed the alien reproduction vehicle Fluxliners utilized. See on screen Mark McCandless's drawing of the trackball used to control the flying saucer. Countless comparisons to the 1988 saucer ARV encounter have been made so far in this project. Perhaps the Fluxliner and TR-3B are born of the same programs. With disclosures as impactful and spellbinding as Fuchet's, his story attracted a great deal of attention and controversy. So, I'd briefly like to mention the contentious arguments that waged war against Fuchet in the early and mid-2010s. This controversy is quite complex, and I have zero skin in this game, so we will simply try and analyze the statements made criticizing and supporting Fuchet in the story of the TR-3B. Let us draw out a few key players here. Jeremy Rice, aka Alien Scientist. David Hamilton, author of Secret Space Program, Andrew Johnson. UFO researcher Dan Benkert and Master Sergeant Fuchet himself. On his website, AlienScientist.com, Jeremy Rice posted some startling opinions on Fuchet after discussing Edgar's autobiography and very real military documents. Jeremy stated the TR-3B testimony was, quote, information that has no technical value and was likely fabricated by Ed in an effort to combine stories about the Nazi Bell device with the Belgian wave of triangular UFO sightings. So that his story would be more believable to the UFO research community, end quote. This claim was based off criticism of Ed stating the TR-3B utilized mercury-based plasma systems alongside strong opinions after years of friendship with the Master Sergeant. After meeting Edgar in 2009, Jeremy would view the veteran as a close friend and legitimate whistleblower for years, quote. After having known Edgar Fuchet for the past four years, I must say that he is one of the most deceitful and manipulative people that I have ever met personally, end quote. Jeremy would accuse this behavior as stemming from PTSD-driven rampant alcoholism. Jeremy would even state Edgar claimed to have flown a TR-3B one night whilst intoxicated, however. He provides no evidence or receipts of this statement. Author Andrew Johnson, who conducted numerous interviews with Fuchet and formed a close friendship on the contrary, spoke very highly of the man. Positions against Edgar from Jeremy Rice and an individual known as David Hamilton crutch on a few key points outside of what Jeremy viewed as a lack of compelling physics behind the TR-3B. Faked military documents and a photo of the F-117A stealth fighter. On an undisclosed date, Edgar sent Jeremy an image alleging to picture Fuchet alongside a crew observing the F-117 prototype at Area 51 between 1977 and 1981. Rice claimed Ed stole the photo from an article titled F-117A Senior Trend. The photographer of this image would even respond, quote, I cannot tell you who is in that photo, but I can tell you that Mr. Fuchet doesn't know what he is talking about, end quote. My issue here is actually Jeremy's initial emails to the photographer Dan. Alien scientist's email was overwhelmingly charged with leading statements against Edgar, providing links to his full disclosures on TR-3B while stating, quote, Ed has constructed a series of lies around this picture being and stationed at Groom Lake. Many of us do not believe Ed at all, end quote. This is not how one elicits an unbiased and objective response. In 2013, YouTuber David Hilton posted a video titled Edgar Fuchet, Fake Documents, which saw subsequent videos posted by Jeremy. It is worth noting both of these projects have been unlisted and removed from YouTube. Whether this is due to walking back the statements or to prevent further controversy, I am not sure. Hilton constructed a group email with Jeremy Rise, Dan B, and Andrew Johnson, author of Secret Program and supporter of Fuchet after a series of extensive interviews with the witness, to discuss the video allegedly exposing Fuchet. Hilton stated, quote, after knowing Ed on a personal level since February of 2012, it is my opinion that he made up slash lied about everything. I've caught him in so many lies and contradictions that I can't keep up with them all. It's not really something that can be completely hashed out in an email, end quote. This statement is rather shocking to me as alongside historical documents provided by Fuchet, numerous documents highlighting Fuchet's military service were pried from Foya by Hilton himself. While we cannot view this video or further context of Hilton claiming Fuchet as a liar, we can analyze Edgar's response on the Outpost Forum in July of 2014. Here, Edgar addressed the points Hilton seemingly made in his video. By his response and defense of the documents, it appears Hilton attempted to address only small inconsistencies within the documents, such as small indentations, variable pressure on letters, physical degradation of source documents and copies. Due to Hilton and Rise retracting their video, I must conclude they conceded these claims against Fuchet. Hilton additionally made some startling comments to the aforementioned Dan B in a June 2012 Skype conversation. Now, Dan B is not to be confused with Dan Burish. This is UFO researcher Dan Benkert, who has co-authored excellent work with Michael Schrat. Benkert has been a staunch reporter of Fuchet after knowing him personally and once offered a fascinating and worthy counter-explanation to a March 19, 2016 article titled, Edgar Fuchet's TR3B is most likely a hoax. Anyways, speaking to Dan B, Hilton would make some extremely startling remarks such as, Actually, I work for an agency that monitors things you shouldn't do. Go ahead and tell people they won't believe you. And I now control Ed, not you. Funny how things work out, isn't it? The exposure becomes a tool of control. Historically, accounts of witnessing NHI craft or NHI crash retrievals contain uniform elements. These craft and technologies of unknown origin seem almost perfect. No seams, no rivets, no bolts, almost as if the craft are 3D printed. Some of these craft feature entirely smooth bodies or what humans would describe as windows, yet some of the craft often appear beautiful and perfect in appearance. This is almost never seen in triangular craft sightings. Let us analyze some of these cases. They've been seen almost in every country by every possible culture. So it's a worldwide phenomenon. We've got a case over here of a red one with this exhaust port here. We've got a case in Detroit. We've got Belgium cases. So a brief cross-section of these aircraft have been seen all around the world. The primary features of these triangles, they usually have a white light on the corner of each of the triangle. Some of these are between 200 and 300 feet across. This mid-section is generally about 20 feet across. And then there's always this interesting structural work on the bottom and probably a red or amber light in the center of the bottom section of the craft. That's kind of the overall view of what we see here. Let's travel back to October 28, 1993 to Croton Falls, New York, in the midst of the Hudson Valley UFO flap and analyze the testimony of Jim Cook. Cook, a biomedical engineer, was driving to his Hudson River Valley home when he encountered a truly bizarre craft. Near the Croton Falls Reservoir, Cook spotted aircraft lights approaching the water level dropping very fast. The lights appeared to hover before blinking out. Cook, walking out of his car to the shoreline, spotted a triangular object hovering 200 feet away, 15 feet above the water. Nine red lights appeared on the triangle side and a red break of light from the underside began to probe the water. Now let's move to the year 2000 in the town of St. Clair in southern Illinois where numerous small-town residents and police officers reported a triangular-shaped craft. In the early morning of January 5th, police officers reported a UFO near Scott Air Force Base. The craft was massive on a elongated black triangle, roughly 75 feet long and 40 feet wide. At each corner sat a bright white light underwaving in luminosity. One smaller flashing red light sat just below the object's midline near the rear two lights. The back of the object appeared rectangular and illuminated in white light. Through the middle of the light running lengthwise was a band of multi-colored illumination. It was stated there were no individual colored lights visible. Rather, it appeared as a band of various colors which blended into each other. A second police officer reported the object heading in a westerly direction, matching the description of initial reports. This officer, Martin, added he believed the object to be maybe 75 to 100 yards in width at an altitude of 1,000 feet. The object was estimated to travel at a loitering speed of 15 miles per hour before accelerating to 100 miles per hour. Let's also jump to Madison, Wisconsin on November 22nd, 1985, where multiple eyewitnesses described a triangular, dull, roughly 40 foot across craft. Excellent researcher Michael Schrat extracted a quote from one of the eyewitnesses who stated the underside of the craft resembled, quote, the back of a refrigerator, like a collection of condensation pipes that ran back and forth, end quote. One can't help but wonder here if this craft scene was an alien reproduction triangle utilizing prototype propulsion systems requiring a massive heat exchanger apparatus. Similar oddities can be observed in the United Kingdom's infamous sighting by Colin Saunders in March of 1999. Saunders and his family, upon driving home from dinner, observed a 50 foot long triangular shaped craft that pitched up and down at roughly a 15 degree angle. Colin claimed the craft bobbed as if it were submerged in water. The exterior of the craft was described as a flowing liquid mercury, which reminds me closely of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan's UFO crash retrieval case, in which Wagan observed a crashed UAP with skin described as the mother of pearl effect. The top of the craft was not flat, but more angled with a strange raised pattern on top Saunders believed to be some sort of docking mechanism with a larger craft. And this same pattern existed on the underside of the craft. Parasitic aircraft are not uncommon in human-made airplanes. In fact, in the 1970s, Youssef proposed a Boeing 747 airborne aircraft carrier to house an array of fighter jets. This sloping top also sounds very dissimilar from the TR-3B, but may sound extremely similar to the craft we're about to discuss. Analyzing the strange lights, fixtures, systems, and appearances of these triangles seen throughout the 1980s to early 2000s, we must ask, were these craft human-made? Were they prototypes or iterations of TR-3B? Or were these all the result of separate legacy programs? Or were these flying triangles somewhere in between? This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out. Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map, is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped. Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs? No. Planes built using UFO technology. Fascinating lines of research fully independent of Huchet's TR-3B leads to a very similar reverse-engineered triangular craft known by disgruntled engineers as the XF-131 Super Sentinel. Let's visit respected artist Bill McDonald, an old-school freelance commercial illustrator, concept designer, forensic reconstruction illustrator, and current sworn law enforcement professional. I have featured McDonald's work in multiple projects, most notably his designs with Dr. Robert Wood of the extraterrestrial entities known as EB-1 and EB-2, described within the Majestic-12 Special Operations Manual, as well as his fantastic work on the Roswell craft and the 1976 Tehran-Iran UFO incident. McDonald additionally featured in a fantastic four-part series on Michael Schrat's YouTube channel titled Roswell Revisited. I, myself, have had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. McDonald and hold an extremely high opinion of him, including speaking on the drawing and case we are about to discuss. And here I present to you the beautiful piece titled Tehachapi Triangle 1992. McDonald met with four old engineers at a denny's in Antelope Valley, California in the spring of 1992. All four engineers, two from Northrop Grumman and two from Lockheed Martin, were fed up with egregious security impositions negatively impacting their lives. All four engineers were subject to extreme project compartmentalization, with each having a piece of the puzzle for the name of the triangular craft Antelope Valley residents had been reporting for numerous years, the XF-131 Super Sentinel. Each of these engineers wanted their story told without threats to their lives. Jail time or stripping of pensions. Does this sound familiar to anybody about the current state of UAP whistleblowers? The four men had found each other over a number of decades while being employed at various facilities surrounding the California high desert. The two Northrop employees hailed from a facility called Tehan, or Tehachapi Ranch by UFO researchers. McDonald claims he was able to confirm this testimony through friends of his father and his father's mentor Robert Scandrett, who worked for Rock L International Strategic Systems Division. The other two claimed to work for Ben Rich at Lockheed Skunkworks in Glendale, California and worked the radar cross-section range known as Hellendale. First off, let's quickly recall a similarity to TR-3B when Fushay asked if Kelly Johnson was the senior project designer for TR-3B, he responded, quote, No, it would have been Ben Rich, end quote. Second, the Hellendale facility located very closely to Edwards Air Force Base in Palmdale, USAF Plant 42, two locations I have directly accused of housing reverse engineering programs, would later be accused by Steven Greer and others as a currently ongoing black-budget deep-six UAP reverse engineering location. Now, interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people in Special Forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it. I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never, of course, flown directly over it because it's classified or spaced and very sensitive. So, you can see what looks like a trough and a runway. It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out. They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-grabbitic, anti-grab. The diamond on the left, you see, it looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic. They just go boom, up. But they're placed over different diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these. We don't have time to go through. And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict, right? Five years before Greer would first label the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale plant as a program location, McDonald's stated the location was designed to be hidden in plain sight. Utilizing the cover of a radar cross-section facility, the location's exterior features a storm drainage flood control channel, which allegedly truly serves as a short runway or platform for the testing of these craft. And here is where things get very, very, very interesting. As I mentioned earlier, I have spoken to McDonald about the XF-131 and he maintains the four engineers were indeed delivering true testimony. I even asked for the individual's identities or leads on the case so I might contact and interview them myself. He has sworn to protect their identities. In the Teha Chape triangle drawing, McDonald exclaimed if viewers recognize the craft, Fox Network contracted McDonald's work and made a computer render of the vehicle for the first regular season episode of the X-Files in the episode titled Deep Throat. This fantastic episode, probably my favorite of the whole series, follows the main characters investigating the disappearance of a USAF test pilot. A mysterious informant tells one of the lead investigators, Mulder, to stay away from the case. Utilizing research and testimony I played at the beginning of this section, Mulder learned that the craft, the Super Sentinel, was a reverse engineered craft from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico case. Investigating the airfield late at night, a triangular shaped craft darts and hovers over Mulder before rapidly speeding away. Music Mulder is then captured by Air Force personnel and given a cocktail to forget about what he saw, but not before he caught a glimpse of the craft in a hangar. Music Rumors persist of the X-Files screenwriter, Chris Carter, mentioning he had been approached by unknown military brass who asked how he knew so much. However, I can find no credible sources here, but what I can find is referenced paranormal writer and 25 year FBI investigator veteran and inspiration for much of the X-Files, John DeSousa. In 2023, DeSousa put out a video on YouTube titled, John DeSousa, 25 year veteran of FBI, John DeSousa is exposing the truth of the UAP invasion. And while I voraciously disagree with the Project Bluebeam fake invasion narrative, DeSousa does make some very interesting remarks directly stating the first season of the X-Files was based off true cases he investigated. The craziest one that I'm still not supposed to talk about, but I can say that it was featured in the first episode of the X-Files or maybe it was the second of the first season. By the way, they used my stories during the first season of the X-Files and then after that they went to other, they no longer used my cases. However, the rest of the X-Files was all based on true stories as well. However, I would say the craziest UFO, the craziest paranormal case was when I was sent to a military base. I can say in general terms, I was sent to a military base, we observed a military base where they had had several disappearances that were associated with the appearance of UFOs in the area. And there were UFOs that the military base said, the commander said, I don't know what to do with this, I'm at my wits end. And so we went to observe these UFOs that had been coming to the outskirts of this military base. And on a regular basis, and they were filled with light. They were filled with light, almost like they didn't even appear metal anymore. And they would just come to the edge of this forest. And there was a group of people who would just do a regular observance of these things. And so myself and my partner, we went and we were with those people. And for some reason, one of the UFOs picked us out for some reason and came directly at us, came directly at us. And just, it appeared to land on us at some point. All the people ran, everyone ran, including us. But it appeared to land on us, but then it didn't because it disappeared somehow. And then we had people from the base who took me in, who took me in against my will. They took me in and they interrogated me as to what my knowledge was of the UFOs. It is endlessly fascinating, Chris Carter of the X-Files specifically contracted McDonald's Tehachapi Triangle, an allegedly real reverse engineered ARV for an episode based on true events. This case is seen further investigation for myself behind the scenes. It's been insanely busy. So I appreciate everybody sticking by me. Please look forward to the Jesse Michaels interview or kind of project and the Eric Davis interview, which I think everybody will find fascinating. I'll probably use clips from an every single project I do from now on here coming shortly. So let's kind of break down what we discussed today. I for one was super excited to take on this project because I think whenever people think of triangular shaped UAP to ARV to anything, they associate it with TR3B. And a lot of the time people don't really know the full story of Edgar Fouchet and kind of the story behind TR3B. I know when getting kind of B-roll and footage and images for this video, quite often the X-F131 Super Sentinel, the TR3A, and another craft called the TR3E are often confused for TR3B. Now, the reason I didn't cover TR3E is this is often used as kind of a toy model based off recovered, based off reverse engineered craft. And I have actually talked to some artists who have drawn this TR3E. For those of you kind of listening right now saying what the heck is he talking about? This is the triangle design that almost has sort of a concave lines in between the vertexes with kind of fins and grates similar to the TR3B and a smallish dome on top. So maybe we'll visit TR3E at this time, but I didn't see too much evidence or worthwhile study here. So I know sort of the breakdown of these craft can be quite complex. So let's just go through that real fast. On one hand, we have X-F131 Super Sentinel, which varies greatly to the TR3B and other triangular designs due to the almost pyramid shape on top that is most similar to the 1999 Kirby England Sighting. And on this side, we have the Aurora program, let's just say. Within Aurora, there's codename Astra, which is the TR3B. Astra is standing for Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft, and the TR and TR3B is standing for Tactical Reconnaissance. The TR3B is the reverse engineered craft that is gravity resistant with companies such as Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, Lockheed, and Northrop spearheaded by CIA, NSA, et cetera, et cetera. Also in that same Aurora program, possibly, is the TR3A, which may use advanced stealth concepts and advanced concepts such as electrogravitics for internal mass reduction, or something like pulse detonation engines. But let's remember that this craft is generally considered more prosaic with a cockpit and so forth, and this may have been what crashed at Boscombe down in 1994. So there's the TR3A, the TR3B, and possibly the TR3E. Remember what Fuchet said? He said there's a whole host of craft in the TR, the tactical reconnaissance line, just the same with the strategic reconnaissance, the SR line. You know, there's the SR71, and Fuchet alleged that at least concepts of an SR74 and 75 were in development while he worked within the defense world and so forth. So I almost find the description that Ed gives of DARCE and other kind of contractors almost more interesting than the TR3B itself. For example, looking at his FOIA Pride documents and seeing the AFFTC, the Air Force Flight Test Center, is really critical for me to be able to analyze this story and start to relay this to other stories or other investigation I've done. You know, him talking about Project Redlight with EGNG for the DOE while EGNG runs Area 51, we can also see that Sandia and I think it's Lawrence Livermore were partners for NEST, Nuclear Emergency Search teams or something like that, but NEST teams. So there's all these delicious little tie-ins, especially when Fuchet mentions treats. As we saw, there's one mention publicly available of treat I could possibly find. And this could be the Army inscom under Stubblebind's version of the Men in Black. But you know, sticking to the video topic, I don't know enough about the physics of TR3B to kind of dispute the craft like Jeremy Rice does. And speaking of that, guys, I'm not looking to get involved in any drama or throw my hat in the ring and defend or criticize Fuchet. I simply thought it important to when you have disclosures as impactful and key as Fuchet is to say, hey, there have been individuals who have brought up issues with certain things he's done. And I just thought it important to relay those and kind of throw in my opinion of what I thought about some of the criticisms. I'm not really trying to get involved or squabble with any of the players still active. So just know that. I do that in good faith by just kind of talking about the arguments. So TR3B XF131 Super Sentinel. TR3B, there's 200 foot test models and 600 foot operational models. The description of the craft down to the diffuse red light on the bottom is very similar to what numerous people have relayed seen. I mean, I'll scroll through any YouTube video of a triangle sighting or I'll talk to anybody at Jujitsu and they'll all say that, yeah, I've had a UFO sighting or my uncle or somebody I know did. They saw a triangle that three right white lights and a red one. These sort of sightings seem almost ubiquitous. They seem very common. And then there's something like the XF131 Super Sentinel whose size is much smaller, whose underside is far more intriguing with the, you know, we didn't really dive into the physics for the engineering because that information is unavailable to myself. But with a large light that seems almost maneuverable on bottom, followed by three pairs of lights kind of on each side of the triangle. I hope everybody enjoyed seeing that in X files. I myself am kind of a new X files fan. So I've seen that episode and watching Mulder kind of pursue this subject about the Air Force test pilots who have gone missing. Just to encounter the triangle, which was reverse engineered from technology at Roswell is so intriguing to me. I myself put a lot of weight on both Fuchet and the TR3B as well as the XF131 Super Sentinel. I have been and will continue to be investigating that specific craft and that specific story as it is just extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely intriguing to myself. But I do want to know what everybody thought about TR3B. You know, after analyzing the full extent to which Fuchet gave testimony, I don't think his story is as simple as, hey, he saw the Belgian UFO wave and he's trying to glom on. I just, I don't think it's as simple as that. Now, the most valid criticism of Ed is besides his three sightings, which were not under program operations, he did not work firsthand on the TR3B. Much of this information was relayed from Gerald, from Bud, from Doc, from Sal, and so forth. So he is ultimately relaying secondhand information. Now, of course, Gerald died pretty soon after their first meeting, but if any of these other gentlemen are still around, Fuchet has not, he has passed and can share this information, please reach out to me. Let's kind of, let's discuss this a little more because the way I see things right now is that there's likely not one, at least two types of ARV that DOD, the Air Force, 412 test group and legacy programs have. This is something like the flux liner, the flying saucer craft that either operates off of electrogravity, magneto hydrodynamics, or zero point energy systems. And then there's something a little less pretty in the triangles, and these likely operate off of electrogravity or MFD devices, MHD devices, as Fuchet talked about. You know, the triangles are not, are not capable of what we would assume NHI and what we analyze NHI craft are capable of with the six observables. Fuchet will talk about the TR3B doing impossible maneuvers, right turns that are very close to actual right turns. However, the speed limitations of this craft and so forth, all of these things, the internal and nervosal dampening, none of these things are too extreme. And this is one of the things that stuck out to me about the flux liner as well, you know, the F4 Phantom jump sheet seats, the off the shelf components with this really interesting reverse engineered or copied propulsion system. The TR3B and the triangles, the, you know, the XF131 Super Sentinel to extent seem very similar, that it's a human attempt to reproduce something fantastic. Now, what are the NHI triangles? Why, if it's true, did Psalm 101 in 1954 say that these triangles are new and little is known about them? You know, we can start to analyze the, the triangle programs in the 80s, 90s, possibly even earlier in the 70s. But, you know, in the 50s, these triangles, are they NHI or are they a breakaway civilizations, a precursor to programs? These questions still exist. These questions are super interesting. How many prototypes of TR3B or XF131 Super Sentinel are possibly these triangles are called something else completely that we are none the wiser to. How many prototypes were they, you know, the heat exchangers underneath the pyramid shaped top and Kirby England as a docking mechanism. These sightings in southern Illinois with these interesting strips of lights. The triangles are fascinating for the era reporting trends of triangles comprising one to four percent. You would be astonished at how many people have reported seen triangle triangular shaped craft. So I'm chewing up a lot of time here, guys. I'm just so excited to be back. I'd like to thank everybody for watching and we are back to our regular regularly scheduled programming. Thank you all so much for joining me into this look into Fushay, into TR3B, into flying triangles, into ARB. I'll catch everybody next time. Thank you so much. Bye.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/B7JP0uX0GwY/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>A.J.

Although the channel has covered the UAP subject in the past, this entry stood out entirely. The video covers the testimony of an individual who encountered a crashed UAP while serving in Vietnam. With engaging storytelling and mesmerizing animations, the Infographics team highlights how this sighting saw the soldier read into covert UAP operations and details his work on the program. Astonishing details of UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering are highlighted in this account very similar to the claims of David Grush. I'm sure many people saw this video, enjoyed it, and moved on. Just as many watched it and thought, huh, I wonder if this is real. But the narrator starts this video with a statement that almost forces us to analyze the entire video line by line. Note, the following is based on testimony provided over a series of interviews and written correspondence, edited and cut together in an attempt to create a cohesive timeline of the events as described. Do these events recount the experience of a real anonymous whistleblower? Is this story rooted in fact, and are there elements we can verify? And why did he speak to the Infographics show? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you for joining me as we conduct a full breakdown and analysis of the Infographics show's US Special Forces Confession, I Recovered UFOs. Since its release, I have played this testimony over and over and over in my head. Is it possible that these events and details recount the true testimony of someone on a UFO crash retrieval program? I think it is well worth investigating their story. Searching for holes or confirmable elements, because this could very well be the most crucial first-hand whistleblower of all time. To start, our witness states, and I will be calling him our witness for the duration of this video, that our story begins in 1968, during the Vietnam conflict along the Vietnam-Kimbodia border. Before we get into his story, we do have two interesting Vietnam cases that may be contextually relevant to our Infographics whistleblower. We can check in on the ever-relevant Stephen Greer redacted witness log to analyze the statements and emails of witness 10622. 10622 served as CTR Communication Technician Radio in the US Navy from 1966 to 1970, on the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier. It was in June of 1968 on official duties, he received scrambled messages mentioning at least 11 UAP were tracked on visual and radar. And on September 9, 1968, several US helicopter pilots and soldiers stationed at a Marine Corps base in Dong Ha, Vietnam had a close encounter with a fast-moving object. This object had green and white lights and engaged in maneuvers for 20 minutes. Anyways, our witness states his US military unit was performing an LRRP, a long-range reconnaissance patrol tracking supply routes into South Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as marking out sites for a B-52 bombing raid the following year. This tiny snippet in the video gives us so much to unpack. The following year of 1969, a covert bombing raid did in fact occur. On March 18, 1969, the Strategic Air Command commenced Operation Menu, not declassified until 2000 by President Bill Clinton. Operation Menu was a year long B-52 bombing campaign that ravaged Eastern Cambodia, and that mention LRRP may be one of the most significant pieces to solving this puzzle. Long-range reconnaissance patrol was a special unit acting in Vietnam, Company E 52nd Infantry, attached to the 1st Calvary Division in the US Army. This unit operated in Vietnam from 1967 to 1969, well within the time frame of our witness and participated in two of the largest battles of Vietnam, the Tet Offensive and Siege of Que Son. In late October of 1968, Company E 52nd Infantry was relocated and headquartered at Phuoc Vinh, north of Vietnam. The division's area of operations was designated along the Cambodian border in Tainin, Bin Long, and Phuoc Long provinces, all in South Vietnam. These areas contained significant routes for enemy infiltration into the Saigon area from Cambodia. So if our witness is telling the truth and this crash is real, this event occurred in October to December 1968 within the Company E 52nd Infantry, LRRP, stationed out of Phuoc Vinh. So far, his testimony lines up exactly with real events. And finally back to our story, a quote unquote object appeared overhead the witness in his platoon, emitting a bright red orange glow appearing to be melting. The object quickly moved out of sight, but only five or six seconds later, a large crash followed by a dull thump reverberated throughout the jungle. The platoon figured this must have been a US plane, so knowing better than to risk long range radio communications being intercepted by Soviet agents, they moved to secure the crash site. Arriving at the site, the platoon knew immediately this was not a US plane classified or acknowledged. The only prosaic explanation the soldiers could think of was a crash base probe, something from NASA or the Soviets. The craft was egg shaped, dull gray and metallic, and seemingly cracked open. Again we see the description this craft appeared to be made from a single piece of metal with no bolts, seams, or screws. This sighting and craft description give us a lot to work off of actually. What immediately stands out to me is this red orange glow the craft emanated while flying over the jungle. There are two cases within our crashes timeframe that are worth mentioning that are similar to this. We can look to November 22nd of 1968 to NICAP case 681122. On this date in Albany, Georgia, a glowing yellow white oval UFO was seen from a car, directed a light beam at the vehicle and flew away changing colors to red and orange. And let's head to move France on December 15th 1968. Reported in a book translated as UFO, the first complete file on close encounters in France. We can find a case where an egg shaped object the size of a car moved quickly without making noise, emanating orange reflections. But let's not forget an event that occurred just a year earlier on March 24th 1967 highlighted in the sworn affidavits by Captain Robert Salas and others at Malmstrom Air Force Base. I covered this case in my UFO and nukes video, but this event saw a red orange oval UAP appear over the base, disabling the ICBMs of Malmstrom. And this mention of an egg shaped object comes up again and again in ufology. We will talk about this more later in the video with the witnesses experience within the program. But let's look at the testimony of aerospace contractor Eric Taper to Aero, who recounted an egg shaped metallic UFO being kept at Area 51 in the 1980s. The description of this craft is almost identical to the Vietnam encounter. And lastly, the molten feel of the craft reminds me closely of the mother of pearl effect displayed on the skin of the craft Lance Corporal Jonathan Waygant claimed to have observed in the jungles of Peru in 1997. Our platoon of Marines called in the crash only to hear there were already birds in root and ordered to secure the crash. Quickly, a pair of F4 jets fell into orbit overhead. The mention of the McDonnell Douglas F4 Phantom II may seem small, but this is actually a huge detail in our story. In June of 1986, former Betul Corps contractor James McCamble told ufology Jacques Valais he met with a military contact with the wild weasels, a codename given by USAF for aircraft equipped with anti radiation missiles and tasked with the suppression of enemy air defenses in Vietnam. This contractor told McCamble F4 jets were equipped with EM detection equipment to detect UAP during the war. Dr. Steven Greer may have an additional witness adding valuable context these claims. Witness 10272 claims to have worked for a UK based contractor installing low observable radar assemblies on F4 fighters at area 51. Along with these claims, the witness alleges to have been involved in the evaluation of hardware from NHI craft. Anyways, infantry then touched down and acted in perimeter security, but I want to note the witness states they were allowed nowhere near the craft. They were deployed in a wide swath. It took two days for the craft to be removed from the jungle, all with the help of SOF, Special Operations Forces, Navy and Air Force officials on site who had already been read into the program. The mention of the Air Force is no surprise here. Ever since the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash and the involvement of USAF General Roger Raimi, the Air Force has long been entwined with the study of UAP. Again, I would like to recommend my Moondust video and USAF Document AFC-1E draft policy, which states Project UFO and Moondust, both headquartered out of the Air Force, have collection responsibilities for UAP and descended foreign space vehicles. The Navy is a bit more interesting. Sure, we have Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who speaks openly about UAP and OPNAV regulations to restrict UAP reporting I covered in my USO videos, but I can't help thinking about the Wilson Davis memo. After all, if this memo is true, which I fully believe it is, DIA Director and Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson was Stonewalled from reading into the program. This was our witness's first ever interaction with the program. Throughout Vietnam, several rapid reaction units were on standby for retrieval purposes, and it's here the witness adds some interesting context. That's what everyone called it, the program, and there were several rapid reaction units stationed throughout in theater. See, we learned from the Korean War that these things are attracted to conflict, and I guess that makes sense. It's probably one of the most interesting things we do. A lot of people think this whole mess started in World War II, and maybe it did, but the program got put together during the Korean War, and that's when it was official. The Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953. While the first US-based retrieval of a UAP occurred in Roswell in 1947, it is possible the program took a few years to put together. If we are going to believe the MJ-12 documents, the program in charge of UAP investigation, crash retrieval, and reverse engineering, operated under US President Truman and briefed President Eisenhower who took office in 1953. This means the program was put together during 1945 more like 1947 to 1950, fitting in nicely with the realm of the Korean War. We can of course guess the program was already implemented by 1950 when senior radio engineer wrote to the Canadian Controller of Telecommunications in the Department of Transport stating the US was actively engaged in studying UAP in an effort so classified it rated even higher than the H-bomb. This information was provided to the engineer Wilbert B. Smith by physicist and member of the US Research and Development Board and student under Einstein, Robert Sarbacher. I highly recommend my video on this subject, as it very well may cover the early days of the program. The witness also states, these things are attracted to conflict. Well, we know from numerous stories including Robert Salas and Mounds from Air Force Base, UAP have a direct interest in observing and interacting with nuclear arms. We know from the testimony of Bob Jacobs, UAP have even an interest in dummy flights of ICBMs. And if the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash is true, let's remember this happening during Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which oversaw extensive nuclear testing. It certainly looks like they want to understand how far we've advanced in our nuclear fizzle kind of technologies at the very least. I mean, it looks like preparatory probing activity. It might be innocent kind of scientific gathering. Could be ISR probing. Anyways, it was at this time the witness and his fellow platoon mates were read into the program. Joining the program was by force. The soldiers were faced with this or a general discharge. Likely drug charges are an Article 15, which gives military commanders an easy way to punish minor infractions breaching military conduct. This draws my attention to an alleged crash retrieval that occurred on April 12, 1954, related to Leonard Stringfield by a witness K.A. You can read about this in Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval status report three, amassing the evidence. And the link, of course, will be in the description. In this incident, K.A. and the USAF crew rescue four out of Roswell Air Force Base were dispatched to a site 25 to 30 miles northwest where they observed a metallic saucer crashed edgewise into the sand with a dome in its center. A ground crew and fatigues was already at this site prevented the men from getting closer and began tagging debris and scattered NHI bodies. K.A. returned to Roswell was debriefed for three days in a quote unquote living hell and told by men identifying as intelligence officers in civilian clothes not to speak about the incident. Reading to K.A. a law that referred to a fine imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge. Our witness states his introduction to the program was highly compartmentalized. He was only told what he needed to know. This mirrors accurately the compartmentalization discussed in the Wilson Davis memo. The four programs that referred Admiral Wilson to the program were quote part of it in different compartments placed in different layers of the compartment's pyramid split up to do different things of parts of it. It is interesting to hear our witness state I didn't even realize those damn things were from space until I actually saw a body. So some of these craft are indeed from space and some are manned vessels. We know from my fast walker video there is factual evidence USG elements had a term for objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere denoted as fast walkers and defense support satellites were likely used to monitor these objects. And the subject of bodies can be pretty contentious but like David Gruss said well naturally when you recover something that's either landed or crashed sometimes you encounter dead pilots and believe it or not as fan as fantastical as that sounds it's true. The witness states the more he figured out the more he was read into the program. He never learned all the truth but knew enough he felt compelled to come forward especially as an aging gentleman. Serving in Vietnam I would put this individual's age at around 74 or older and claiming he had been out of the program for 20 years means his service in the program occurred from around 1969 to 2004. The witness even discusses David Grush commenting on his approach to speaking publicly and labeling him a patriot. He even confirms the involvement of aerospace contractors and sophisticated disinformation. I don't think we need to expand on these topics too much in general as I have multiple videos exploring the full involvement of Lockheed Martin and Battelle Memorial Institute's interaction with UAP and fully covered the birth of the UAP stigma. Check out those videos for some valuable context here. After being read into the program the witness's unit was put back on duty but broken up and placed in horrific combat engagements. Five of the original 12 died in combat. I know five of the original 12 died in combat. Three more badly wounded. I think they were trying to kill us off. If this broken up team still served with the first Calvary Division LRRP we may in fact be able to track these names. Of the 1,000 men who served in this unit 45 were killed in Vietnam and Cambodia. And the witness states a year after the initial crash he was officially brought into the program where his primary job was no longer being a soldier but he was now part of the program. So with this information we can conclude that these soldiers were killed between October to December of 1968 where the crash occurred and October to December of 1969 when he was brought into the program and we'll give an error factor of around plus or minus let's say three months. I have actually found a memorial site dedicated to those served and fell in the LRRP unit within the first Calvary Division. Analyzing the casualty list we can try and trace the deaths of these brave soldiers from the time of our crash October to December 68 and our witness being read into the program October to December 1969. So we're left with 16 possible names. If we filter out soldiers who died of non-hostile actions we are left with eight possible names. If our witness is telling the truth five of eight of these names are likely platoon mates of his who observed the crashed egg-shaped UAP. It didn't happen often but these things did fall out of the sky where people would see something land or witness beings happening more often than people know and we'd swoop in as fast as we could in case there was anything to snatch up. I think we pulled three total craft out of theater and not just Vietnam. Damn near started a war with China in one recovery. Up to three craft in Vietnam well perhaps there are others who can expand on this. Within Stephen Greer's redacted witness list we return to again and again and again we find witness 10659 quote first hand involvement in Vietnam crash slash retrieval of ET craft involved directly with ET technology POC to other military UFO events including dad's presence at 1954 Edwards Air Force Base UFO landing. I do think this witness is separate from our infographics witness due to the claims of dad's presence at a 1954 Edwards AFB landing. The witness comments how one retrieval almost started a war with China the program only getting the upper hand due to China's primitive early warning systems. David Grush has commented on this a multi-decade long cold war between the U.S. China and other U.S. adversaries. We're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it's a it's a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long and you know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to the subject and I think the up to secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where a country might make a breakthrough let's say we that's an adversary of ours and it is so destabilizing. You say there's been a cold war behind the scenes with Russia and China. There has been a cold war against our with our with our peer adversaries yeah. The witness also states recoveries in the ocean would be near impossible that Europe was another hotspot for UFO activity. This was due to curiosity towards the always militarized European mainland especially within the Cold War and a few decades removed from World War two. Europe was able to keep a tighter lid on the subject especially with the European populace quote turning their nose up at the whole UFO thing end quote. The crafts themselves were extraordinary that's the only way to describe them I wasn't there for every single recovery obviously but they kept collections of them in different places and I got to see two of the collections. The question of craft housing and material handling is done is always fascinating starting with a quote unquote collection of craft as we know from David Grush the USG is in possession of up to 12 to 15 craft. When you say crash retrieval what do you mean? These are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles you know call it spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed. We have spacecraft from another species. We do yeah. How many? Quite a number. You're kidding. No. These claims have been echoed by numerous whistleblowers including alleged S4 project Aquarius biologist Dan Burish. Sit tight for a video on him but he claimed nine hangar bays housed UAP and reverse engineered vehicles including the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash at S4. The witness states Wright Patterson and the foreign technology division is a red herring that this is where the Soviets would have immediately come looking quote we faked some stuff going into Wright Patterson and quote it's likely in the early days of the program Wright Pat housed both crashes and biological material and we only have to look at Roswell to guess that this means that either before or during the witness's tenure in the program program duty shifted away from the airbase and any sort of material or crash hiding at Wright Pat from roughly 1969 to 2004 our hoax is perpetrated by the program. Now there is some conflicting information here as I think back to the testimony of Senator Barry Goldwater who in 1975 was Stonewalled by General Curtis LeMay into accessing the blue room at Wright Pat where UAP information and materials were likely stored. Possibly this means Wright Pat held a database or record of UAP and program activity but not actual materials and biologics. There were these co-opsites run by the government and the big defense contractors people like Raytheon, Boeing, everyone knows their names but also people like Texas Instruments. It was a whole umbrella but the little guys only got a tiny piece of the puzzle. Some guys from TI would get a piece of something and then be asked to figure out how it works never being told where it came from and on its own I'm sure these eggheads had their suspicions but it's hard to tell if something's actually alien. Raytheon, Boeing, and Texas Instruments are specifically name dropped and we can infer TI is one of the quote-unquote little guys mentioned here as the witness proposes the example of TI getting a little piece of something. Can we find one interesting connection for each of these three companies? Well to start we can find Raytheon name drop specifically alongside Lockheed Martin, Aerospace Corp, TRW, etc. by Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Haish as one of a major aerospace company in which the legacy UAP programs hide. In 1956, Boeing was mentioned in a special weapons study of aviation studies examination of electro-gravity systems. This piece references a project winner haven which suggests construction of a saucer creating a local gravitational field designated to serve as a USAF interceptor. Boeing was one such company mentioned on working on these anti-gravity rigs. When we hear Texas Instruments we think of the TI-84 calculator that got me through college at least I do. But TI also operates within the aerospace and defense industries. Unfortunately, there is not much to confirm here as the only link to TI I can find is a 1961 establishment of the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies by TI to work on gravitational physics. And finally on to everybody's favorite subject the craft. The witness makes a very curious claim. Although he knows these craft can operate in a microgravity medium he does not know if they are really spacecraft and wonders if quote that's where they want us to think they are coming from end quote. The witness comments ufology has done a pretty good job at compiling craft shape. So you got your flying eggs your tic-tacs I guess you now call them we just call them pills your old fashioned saucers bells triangles whole message shapes but the ones that crash are almost always the eggs and the bells. In Aero's data from 1996 to 2023 we can actually find the most commonly reported UAP configurations. Factoring out spheres and lights which in my opinion often have a more possible prosaic explanation than other configurations we can see commonly cited craft shapes accurately reflect our witnesses list. Eggs and bell shapes are the most frequently crashed objects according to our witness sometimes disintegrating on impact and our witness claims these are likely unmanned drones. We have already covered some really interesting and possibly credible eggs and oval shaped objects Eric Tabor and Jonathan Wagan. But what about this bell there is a fascinating and perplexing case that occurred in 1965 in Kecksburg Pennsylvania I plan to cover soon. Allegedly a bell shaped almost acorn object crashed in the area. This case was covered extensively by Leonard Stringfield so if you'd like to brush up before my video I recommend reading his UFO crash retrievals the inner sanctum status report 6 and if you remember from my Robert Sarbacher video Dr. Eric Walker an alleged original program manager claimed to have been on site and at location for this crashed object. Our witness declares the saucers are the crown jewels and he only ever participated in the recovery of two such craft. I probably don't need to dive too much into the importance of discs or saucers in UFO lore but let's see if we can investigate the witnesses aid in a crash retrieval in South America. The saucer we recovered and hit the side of a rocky outcropping on its way down it smashed the rock to pieces then took out a quarter mile of trees if it had happened on the outskirts of civilization the whole UFO mystery would have been public knowledge by now that's how much destruction that thing cost but the craft itself was relatively unharmed. I will be using the date frame 1969 to 2004 I derived earlier for our witnesses time in the program. I can find three relevant cases for my all-time favorite crash retrieval handbook Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood. We will not be covering the 1997 Jonathan Wagan Peru case or the 1978 Moondust retrieval in Bolivia as these craft are explicitly stated as not saucer-like. One example can be found that was also relayed in the notes of Leonard Stringfield dated March 23rd 1978. In his notes Stringfield spoke with one Bob Berry who claimed a UFO crash retrieval occurred on November 11th 1975. Berry close to Lima Peru this craft was unmanned and measured 12 feet high and 8 feet in diameter. If what our witnesses saying is true and mostly egg slash bells are unmanned this may not be a saucer but still worth mentioning the outer surface was metallic with material deemed to be non-terrestrial. Another possible event occurred in Potorio's Chile 1978 pulled from the files of Bob Pratt also he learned while in the area a year later a tremendous explosion occurred that woke up all 3,000 people in the area all houses shook and everyone thought a blast furnace had exploded. Engineers determined the event was an air burst the explosion occurred in the air and the blast force exerted downwards. Following the crash American operatives and NASA coveralls arrived at the scene questioning witnesses. An American or Soviet spacecraft maybe but when Bob Pratt filed FOIA request to NASA and the CIA they responded they had no data on the event. And we can find a third case that's also mentioned in Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval syndrome status report two new sources new data which discusses an October 3rd 1980 saucer crash in Piedra de la Gu\u00eda, Argentina. Here witnesses in a 300 mile radius saw what appeared to be a saucer shaped fireball come down from the skies and explode near 7 p.m. Some witnesses claim the fireball flew in circles before crashing exhibiting intelligent control. Captain Carlos Lima then head of the space research division of the Argentinian Air Force officially investigated the incident he found four burned spots circular and 10 to 18 meters in diameter and notice what appeared quote to be the product of combustion originated by liquid fuel or some sort of material with a very high temperature end quote could any of these cases are possibly the Varginia Brazil case so excellently covered by James Fox be the crash our witness mentioned when the witness reached the administrative side of the program he learned saucers were formed from a single piece of material or put together at an atomic level quote even the entrance is invisible until it actually opens and quote but interiors could be accessed through destructive and non destructive means I have recently covered two witnesses whose claims mirror these statements identically MS who declared the UFO he observed undergoing inspections at Dugway Proving Ground was quote flawless like it had been 3d printed and RB who claimed the saucer he guarded in 1963 had a door panel with tolerances so tight not even a piece of paper could fit through the seams the first mention of biologics comes with the South American saucer retrieval once access was gained to the craft the interior reeked of decaying organic material the quote unquote things inside were dead I call them things on purpose not out of disrespect or anything like that I just don't think any of us were ever convinced they were actually living creatures well not in the sense that you and I are these biologics featured a crude digestive system only enough to process basic proteins and such leading the witness and program to believe these things were similar to biological androids the typical gray alien depicted in media is allegedly accurate but these beings are a little taller than the famous humanoids and possess large but not massive eyes the witness remarks how these beings were raised in a dimly lit environment supported by their dimly lit craft these creatures feature long limbs and knees quote not in the right places end quote the subject of almost android like living beings has been echoed by many including dr gary nolyn I think that part of what we are seeing here I mean look if you're an intelligence are you gonna go down on a planet with a bunch of angry monkeys who might kill you no unlikely you'll send some intermediary well what kind of intermediary you're gonna send you're gonna send something that maybe almost looks like them but isn't them so I think and this is again from inside the intelligence community most of what we think we're seeing are avatars biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions if you will and that's that's the current view of that's a that is a it is a hypothesis living by a logics had been recovered by our witness specifically at a near UK based retrieval this event occurred at the same time of a meteor strike in the UK area and I actually think I may have found this incident this story occurred in May of 1996 in Boyle Ireland locals witnessed a meteor or an aerial craft heading towards land appearing to misjudge its approach shearing trees and landing in the lake allegedly several occupants were taken into custody by a retrieval team and significant military activity including American soldiers continued for the following six months even local police were instructed to stay away the American soldier bit here is key as our witness states Europe has a default agreement with the United States that recovered materials go to the US but quote that's the price you pay for having a superpower watch your back at this crash site the witness states two of five of the craft's crew survived light bruising covered the dead from the hard landing the program has ruthlessly strict protocols for dealing with live biologics according to our witness these rules include never leveling a weapon at a bean and for that matter security is positioned well away and out of sight from the biologics immediately taking readings to ensure nothing toxic or hazardous is present near the craft and medical personnel are then sent to the craft area or interior including the lead doctor known as the ambassador who always spoke at least english chinese spanish and russian the biologics at this uk crash just stood around aimlessly solely reacting to basic stimuli as the team entered the craft after the door opened on its own the beans were even let out of the craft like school children in this instance and almost any other where live biologics were recovered the witness remarks the beans live at most a few days before they keel over dead these points alongside the fact that beans could breathe earth's atmosphere are used by the witness to support the hypothesis they are like drones or biological computers like gary nolan said whatever's making these things just creates a biological crew when it needs one and they do their job and nothing else at least that was our theory because their bodies didn't seem built to last and the eggheads found it suspicious that they were able to breathe our atmosphere so easily of course we do not have access to any living or deceased nhi biologics in the public sector so are there at least any parallels we can draw from the witness the subject of biologics and their taxonomy is one of the most contentious subjects in uap the visual of the classic gray alien small beans varying in color with elongated limbs frail bodies enlarged head large to enormous eyes tiny to non-existent noses and mouths have been echoed since the dawn of uap lore from roswell to kingman to abductee claims to myriad files in the lennard string field files similar descriptions of non-human biologics pop up everywhere and this isn't mentioning countless accusations of the program being in possession of living and dead beans unfortunately this is also one of the most lied about and hoaxed aspects of the phenomenon so for now we must stick to the direct confirmation of biological retrieval confirmed by grush sometimes you encounter um dead pilots and relate statements of quote little gray men whose ships had crashed or had been shot down being kept on ice by the air force technology division at right paterson air force base end quote as stated by former special assistant to the deputy director of the cia victor marchetti our witness goes back to pondering why it is saucers and maybe one or two other types actually have a manned crew i'm guessing maybe one of these is the triangular shape the witness in the program had a theory quote this was all being fabricated for us and even tasked nasa to look for where something like a big 3d printer could be in the solar system some facility or computer just making these crafts and these things and sending them to earth and sometimes they crashed or they just landed and didn't take off like whatever was doing this wanted us to recover the craft i don't know if they ever found anything though there was some excitement for a while it's hard to hide heat in space and obviously making these crafts on such a large scale would give off a lot of heat or maybe not maybe they use physics we don't even understand these are some very charged statements with a lot to unpack we do know around the time of our witnesses involvement in the program nasa openly denied studying ufo's however we can find a letter to nasa chief of ground operations safety dated december 13th 1977 this page observed only via foyer request is directed towards the nasa administrator about ufo's detailing quote what could be a piece of a ufo end quote was examined at los alamos for a period of over two months additionally on page 121 and 126 of this black vault pdf detailing nasa foyer requests we can see internal memo admit the agency conducted a ufo hard evidence analysis program titled ufo heap around the late 70s and this 3d printer has actually a very real basis in 20th century physics the idea of a universal constructor or self-replicating automata was first proposed in the 1940s by physicist john von neumann who by the way was listed as being involved in ufo recovery along with vanavar bush and robert oppenheimer by physicist robert sarbacher i talked about earlier his theory explores how a sub faster than light civilization can colonize a galaxy the automata involve robotic or nano robotic systems that replicate by creating miniature copies of themselves which grow over time such a feat would require an abundance of material so maybe this heat signature the witness mentioned occurred near our asteroid belt but the replicator hub nestled within the dark regions of a solar system for creating craft and i guess biologics is an extremely plausible scenario this even rings identically to the alleged four-chan whistleblower who stated a ufo replicator lies within our oceans and these statements by our witness quote whatever was doing this wanted us to recover the craft and quote is widely known within ufology as donation craft this subject has been touched on by david grush call it spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed is the subject of eric taber's aero testimony as this egg-shaped craft was simply found untouched in the desert and features in many corners of ufology the witness makes multiple mentions to failed in 1990s successful attempts to down uap craft one failure occurred in iran and i am almost positive this is the 1976 iran major jeffari case the successful downing of uap craft is something i have covered often including in my last video where witness tb states the usg developed technology within the star wars program to down craft people have been hurt by these craft according to the witness but theorizes this is incidental and a byproduct of the craft themselves manned or unmanned the craft have the ability to distort perception and mess with minds quote unquote anchors were formed for recovery operatives to keep them grounded in reality for instance if you and i were on a security team and approached a craft would say okay the craft is resting up against a big oak tree and there's a gray boulder on the other side you think of that picture and it would help with the confusion whenever that effect happened kind of warded off this messing with human cognition has been mentioned extensively by dr gary nolan and even mentioned an atyp slide nine leaked from christ for melons personal website and lastly what do they want the witness doesn't know the program strongly supports the donation theory where the craft are gifted maybe the technology is gifted to not cause massive disruption within our own evolution we had another conclusion though this one more disturbing maybe they just left these crafts lying around because they were easy to build hey guys thank you so much for watching as i broke down the infographics whistleblower who claimed to have first-hand experience in the crash retrieval program my objective of this video was to analyze some of these claims relate them to ufology at large as well as try to investigate as much as we could about this whistleblower to see if their testimony and the individual is fact or fiction so i think i feel pretty confident in us being able to kind of determine the time frame of this initial event in vietnam occurring october to december in 1968 in company e 52nd infantry in the first calvary division l r r p close to saigon and south vietnam probably fourth long and i'm pretty confident in five of the eight or nine names i may have messed that up who following died in combat after the initial sighting of the uap from our whistleblower and i'm also pretty confident in this introduction to the program october to december in 1969 and his years of service 1969 to 2004 i'm also medium confident on the three south america crashes and ireland uk crash that occurred in 1996 these are all uh not very known cases pretty kind of low key but you know these kind of fit our timetable fit um fit our interest fit what we were looking for so guys i do have a theory on who this whistleblower might be i now this could very well be false i don't think it holds much water more so than dates and kind of interesting coincidences lining up because if i had to put money on it i do think this whistleblower is offering some uh true testimony here i don't think this is as simple as just something fictitious is a very interesting testimony and a lot of things that line up to you follow g yet large but the theory remember just a theory uh for those of you who watched my last video the witness tb do you remember the general that he said showed classified uap derived cloaking technology in 2004 and was thus investigated demoted a star and retired this is general john m rigs guys i think it's possible that this whistleblower is this aforementioned general general john m rigs why do i think that well john m rigs enlisted in the u.s army in 1965 was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1969 and he then went on to achieve 1100 hours of flight time earning himself a distinguished cross remember what he said in theater in vietnam a rapid reaction unit this would make sense that if he then got his uh flying license in the military helicopter pilot he would have then served on that rapid reaction unit possibly providing perimeter security and and flying the team there right so his time in the military was 1965 when he enlisted 1969 when he was commissioned an officer to 2004 john m rigs was forced to retire in 2004 2005 so this lines up exactly with our witnesses tenure in the program as well and our witness states eventually he moved over to the administrative side of the program right well john m rigs was promoted to general and higher up in the military worked with congress he was also stationed at a u.s army base in in um i'm trying to look in in germany i'm not quite sure when this is but this would line up with our u uh u k based crash would it not kind of a as our witness says that europe is always ready in a constant state of war that you know these objects are attracted to conflict there um again this theory doesn't hold much water but we know that if this story about john m rigs is true which i do believe it is because i do with the credibility of of tb's claims mr rigs is also well aware of uap drive tech reverse engineering and crash retrieval efforts and let's not forget once he retired after allegedly showing a bae systems employee classified technology he went on to then serve as an aviation and strategic defense consultant so not much besides dates and i don't want to kick off an investigation i can't control because there's still so much more to investigate with this but that is my little theory right now um if you guys have watched this and you have another theory let me know what it is because i'm i'm investigating i really want to get to the bottom of this because this is such an interesting story and as we can see that a 25 minute video takes over 40 minutes to kind of analyze and not just watching the video right like you guys know i'm not just a screen cap in the video plan me pausing every couple of minutes and giving my thoughts no we're linking documents we're linking cases we're linking relevant video footage and clips so yeah that shows you how much meat is on the bone of this specific case i think it's enthralling and i really have tried to get in contact with the infographics team everything short of paying to to become a member of theirs to join their discord which i i just might at this point because i really want to find this out but i hope you guys have just as great of a time kind of sifting through this video as i did in and joining me on this venture as we try to learn more about this whistleblower and determine if this is a real individual and real experience i know i find the um the biologics the androids one of the most interesting things ever since grush came out last summer of 2023 and talked about biologics that statement as he testified to congress biologics dead pilots as he said to ross colthart has enthralled me and and hearing gary nolan talk about the hypothesis of biological androids that's just something i found so interesting if any of you guys listen to the podcast mysterious universe i think this was back in 2017 i can't remember exactly when they did a show on this exact subject kind of like the classic grays being a biological android so for the better part of a decade now i've been thinking about this theory it's just been so interesting to my head so you know watching this whistleblower say that these biologics are like children respond to basic stimuli keel over and dead and die when their purpose is done it's just so fascinating to me so in the comments guys let me know what you think please remember to like and subscribe always remember i got a patreon if you think the channel's worth anything i don't gatekeep any content uh just support what you think the channel's worth and uh please let me know what you think i'd love to get some more discussion around this video and i will catch everybody on the next show thank you</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/DcvuglS7ps4/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Barry Goldwater</li> <li>Bernard Haish</li> <li>Bill Clinton</li> <li>Bin

All of these things, and particularly interestingly, without sonic booms and the things that we don't like about our supersonic aircraft, all of these things indicate a type of propulsion, which is unique. Different than anything we know anything about, and which would be a tremendous value if we could develop it and use it. That's the reason I feel with a number of others who have studied it, that it is a subject which deserves the highest type of scientific study and at an early date. The advantages to be gained are perfectly enormous. And how long do you feel it will be before we are flying in UFOs? Well, this probably is a $64 question without a question without. I think it depends, a great deal, on how rapidly we take them seriously and how soon we really set up a scientific study team to work on the subject. This is where we push the laws of physics. You see, the technology we make is what makes the impossible possible. And it doesn't stop there. So far on this channel, we have devoted entire investigations towards Battelle Memorial Institute and their possible work on shape memory alloys recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash, as well as Lockheed Martin and their intimate decades long involvement in UFO legacy programs. After all, high profile US defense contractors have for decades been accused of actively engaging in material exploitation and reverse engineering programs, focused on technologies of unknown origin in conjunction with various factions within US government intelligence and military. Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right? And they'll hand recede it out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis, which I find highly unethical. You have basically a sole source arrangement and you allow certain private corporate elements to look at this, develop a potential insight and then sell it back to the government for profit. And I think that's totally unethical. Lockheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work, both in our atmosphere, in space, and even underwater. There are certain efforts to... It's a tough question you ask. I left the Air Force and was sent out to California at that time to begin establishing my cover basis as an independent contractor so that I can serve what was coming down the line next for me. And that is the path which led to the UAP subject. These claims are not without merit as since the inception of the US military industrial complex, private defense industry has worked in tandem with military and intelligence to bolster US military might protected by waived, unacknowledged special access programs. I have directly accused Lockheed Martin, Patel, Boeing, SAIC, and many other private institutions and semi-private institutions, such as UARCs and FFRDCs possessing, experimenting with and possibly successfully harnessing non-human technologies. Today, we focus our sights towards the US Aerospace and Defense Colossus and father of the B-2 stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman, often overshadowed by the infamy of Lockheed and their involvement in the 2008 failed attempt to divest recovered NHI materials to the OSAP program. Northrop Grumman has largely successfully distanced itself from the spotlight of defense contractors engaging with UAP legacy programs. In fact, focused discussion on the alien reproduction vehicle, Fluxliner, as relayed by Brad Sorensen and the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle discussed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet seemed to primarily focus on Lockheed. These testimonies highlight the defense contractor successfully reverse engineering non-human craft to operate under human control. But throughout such disclosures, Lockheed isn't the sole contractor accused of such highly classified efforts. Hardly mentioned, but always alongside in the shadows is Northrop Grumman. Could Northrop Grumman truly be involved in material exploitation of technologies of unknown origin, TUOs? Just how far does their involvement with UFO studies go? Join me today as we peer into the shadows to find out. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so much for joining me as we touch back to UFOs in the private sector. This time to Northrop Grumman. The contractor I believe alongside Lockheed is the Paramount Aerospace Corporation entrenched in UFO legacy programs. From whistleblower testimony to analysis of Northrop's numerous acquisitions over the decades, let's thoroughly dive into the legendary Northrop Grumman and their involvement in UFO legacy programs. Let's start by analyzing the history of Northrop and its many, many, many acquisitions over the decades. Northrop Grumman is an American aerospace and defense company employing over 95,000 employees with an annual revenue of $30 billion. The industry giant has achieved extraordinary engineering feat such as aiding in the development of the James Webb Space Telescope and directly creating the B-2 Spirit Bomber and B-21 Raider, the world's only known stealth bombers. Northrop Grumman operates in four major divisions, aeronautics, defense, space and mission systems, outside of military aircraft, space systems and weapon development. Northrop also engages in cyber security, information technology and radar and sensor systems. Briefly, I do take an extreme interest in Northrop's C-4 ISR, Command Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, which falls under Northrop's land-based critical technology services, sustainment and modernization. C-4 ISR is essentially the military's nervous system consisting of various electronic equipment and technologies serving to aid the modern warfighter through data and intelligence. I am currently working on a thesis that select contractor C-4 ISR programs engage in deep-six waved USAPs for crash retrieval and ARV testing, data and analysis, let me explain. Northrop was one of the premier contractors operating C-4 ISR for the Strategic Defense Initiative instituted under Reagan in 1983. Northrop created the first laser radar used in space for SDI. I have discussed numerous times lines of research which state SDI focused on Soviet ICBM nuclear defense, secretly studied and employed offensive capabilities against UAP and siphoned program funds to UAP legacy programs such as the DARS, Defense Advanced Research Center, proposed to exist in an ARPA document. SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation, frequently secures massive hundreds of million dollar contracts for C-4 ISR at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane. I have published extensive research, SAIC runs an off-world technologies division to house recovered NHI artifacts at the Crane Naval location. When discussing witness Ed in the existence of a joint ARV testing program out of Edwards Air Force Base in Area 51 under the Edwards 412 test group, I made reference to a Lockheed Martin ISR case study. In this study, Lockheed was tasked with updating the system used by USAF Warfare Center for Intelligence Collection and Data Processing. Lockheed reconfigured a two phase security classification system used by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. Yes, the same agency Grush was a part of when liaison to the UAP task force and the same agency recently mentioned by respected journalist Chris Sharp as participating in undersea UAP crash retrievals. The system was implemented to the combined air and space operation center at Nellis Air Force Base, which is tasked with processing information for exploitation of time sensitive targets. At the time I speculated, although this Lockheed project arose from challenges in the Nellis Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training Exercise, could such systems be used to monitor UAP and UAP crash retrievals? Although C4 ISR is common and the nervous system of the armed forces, I do think analyzing Defense Corporation's C4 ISR contracts and projects with USAF Army and Navy can lead to knocking on the door of UAP program operations. And after that long discussion, finally back to the history of Northrop Grumman. NG arose from the merging of two military aircraft companies, the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Company and the Northrop Company in 1994. Throughout its storied history, Northrop made a few very key acquisitions. We will continue to reference over and over again throughout this project. One such acquisition occurred in 1999 with procurement of Teledyne Ryan, developer of surveillance systems at unmanned aircraft. In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc, a corporation involved in aerospace, electronics and the automotive industries. Outside of computers, systems engineering, integrated circuits, TRW was a true trailblazer in spacecraft construction, building pioneer one, 10 and numerous space-based observatories. The defense giant considered TRW, its quote unquote capstone acquisition signaling the end to Northrop Grumman's aggressive purchasing streak. Why was TRW considered the crown jewel of Northrop's purchases? While there is evidence to suggest this was due to TRW operating a portfolio of UAP legacy programs upon purchase. Lengthy investigation must be done to discover the UFO program portfolio Northrop may have inherited from TRW. TRW has long been associated with a rumored crash retrieval program run out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a topic even touched on by Lou Elizondo in his book Eminent. And let's mention that in June of 1960, TRW spawned the Aerospace Corporation. The Aerospace Corporation has additionally been implicated in UFO legacy programs and served as a place for employment for OSAP physicist and member of the Wilson Davis meeting Dr. Eric Davis. I would additionally like to draw attention to the year the Aerospace Corporation was founded in 1960 and relate this founding to the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Philip J. Corso. Corso stated 1958 to 1962 oversaw the golden age of U.S. Army R&amp;D where Army assets, universities, laboratories, and private industry were leveraged to reverse engineer non-human technology to bolster the U.S. war machine. Analyzing Army primers from around this time highlight a period of massive innovation in Army research and development. The MITRE Corporation was born during this time in 1959 with lines of research to suggest its formation was to engage in such research and development projects alongside Bell Labs, Sperry Rand, et cetera. The Aerospace Corporation founded just one year post-MITRE, maybe one additional corporation spawned from TRW for U.S. Army legacy operations. And worthy to note, both MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation are both known as FFRDCs, federally funded research and development centers. Present day, the Aerospace Corporation manages the Aerospace FFRDC for the Department of Defense and Air Force to support, quote, national security space programs, end quote. We are truly the only space enterprise that exists in the United States. And I mean this at the agency level in the government, the FFRDCs in private industry. There is no other organization that does national security space, civil and commercial, and international as well, that ties these all together with both the breadth and the depth that we bring to this problem. I have spoken at length about FFRDCs, semi-private institutions that play a crucial hand in UAP legacy programs. I recommend any of my previous four investigations to hear more on the subject. It is intriguing, Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo, all but admitted the Aerospace Corporation built from TRW is actively involved in UAP legacy programs. And that up to that point, TRW had been a primary contractor in such UFO programs. So all this talk about private contractors, you know, the big Lockheed Martin, what about federally funded research and development centers, such as MITRE, RAND, TRIAD, Oak Ridge, and UARC, so university affiliated research centers, where do they fall into this? Only one, and I won't name it. It started out as a contractor in 1960, starting not too long after it was born. It was actually a spinoff of TRW. So TRW was the principal investigator for the first roughly what, almost 30, yeah, practically, well, 29 years. Before we keep discussing TRW, let's highlight a former U.S. Premier Electronics Manufacturer implicated in TUO exploitation by Lieutenant Colonel Corsa with possible ties to MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation, this being the company I just mentioned above, the Sparey RAND Corporation. In his manuscript, Corsa would reference the personal memoirs of Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau, Chief of U.S. Army R&amp;D and Founder of the Army's Foreign Technology Division, and how Trudeau would engage in frequent meetings with Sparey RAND's board, including legendary General Douglas MacArthur. Sparey RAND went defunct in 1986 and its former divisions became part of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Honeywell, and you guessed it, Northrop Grumman, all companies implicated in UFO legacy programs. But let's get back to TRW. TRW features some familiar faces of this channel many will recognize. Remember if you will, Dr. Eric Walker, the scientist named by physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher as participating in UFO crash retrieval meetings alongside Vannefar Bush in the 1950s. Walker started Penn State's University Affiliated Research Center, self-admitted he knew about the Majestic 12 and was present at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash. I have always talked about how Walker is one of the most crucial names in UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs in the 1950s and 1960s. Much intrigues me about Walker, including his position as former chairman of TRW. TRW has also been discussed at length by respected researchers such as Richard Dolan as the primary contractor running a crash retrieval program under the project named Zodiac. Project Zodiac, an MJ-12-like entity, is not our subject today. However, we may discuss it soon as the story of Zodiac by pseudonym Sedge Masters is utterly captivating. And with TRW, we may just have a paper trail to connect them and Northrop to legacy operations. In 2004, former assistant secretary of housing and urban development, Catherine Austin Fitz, wrote a paper called The Black Budget of the United States. This paper stated a large portion of the nation's wealth had ongoing leave and illegally diverted into secret, unaccountable channels to support clandestine military research and development. Some to a majority of which had been suggested to be UAP-related. While at the HUD department, Fitz came across information various high-profile defense contractors accounting systems were responsible for scrubbing and obfuscating the direction of these funds. Although a 1990 federal law mandated every single U.S. government agency be audited, the Pentagon never publicly faced a comprehensive audit until one was launched in December of 2017. And not to mention since, the Pentagon has never passed an audit. And this 2017 audit may have happened solely due to another Catherine Austin Fitz University paper detailing $21 trillion in unauthorized spending in the DOD and Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1998 to 2015. In the Wilson Davis memo, which I have talked about so many times, Admiral Thomas Wilson relates to Dr. Eric Davis, the watch committee, the gatekeepers of the UAP legacy program portfolio, told Wilson they are organized after an audit in the 1990s almost blew their cover. What this means is essentially a failed audit led to UAP programs being reorganized under the special access program oversight committee, senior review group. Here is where we circle back. In 2003, Northrop Grumman settled a lawsuit from the U.S. government for $111 million, almost $200 million today. This settlement was due to Northrop subsidiary TRW, overcharging for government work done on space projects in the early 1990s. This suggests TRW's inflated space project contracts were implicated and uncovered in the failed audit mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo that took place in the 1990s. Timelines indeed match up as the beginning roots of this lawsuit can be traced back to 1994. TRW's likely involvement with UAP legacy waived unacknowledged special access programs appeared as contract overcharging to the wider DOD auditing officials, leading to the lawsuit against TRW settled by Northrop, utterly fascinating. If this hypothesis is accurate, Northrop settled the suit and reorganized their UAP portfolio under the SAPOX Senior Review Group program reorganization that was relayed to Wilson. To make Northrop's purchase of TRW even more interesting, shortly before Northrop bought TRW in 2002, TRW had purchased BDM, Braddock Dunn and McDonald in 1997. BDM was a technical services firm that headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. BDM specialized in and worked primarily with missile guidance, application optics, electronic instrumentation, and radiation physics. BDM was also founded in 1959, around the same time as MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation. BDM was mentioned specifically by Commander Will Miller of the Wilson Davis Memo in the year 2000. The former U.S. Navy commander stated numerous government individuals such as Defense Intelligence Agency directors who in this case would have been Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson were isolated from UAP knowledge. The quote-unquote keepers of the secrets resided in DOD middle management and civilian contractors like Boeing, Lockheed, and BDM. To learn more about Miller and why his words carry weight, I highly recommend watching my video on the Wilson Davis Memo. Sure, it's my first video and it's very amateurish, but there's still some good information there. BDM could warrant its own video, but for now, I leave you with this. Just like FFRDCs, I have talked ad nauseam of Major General Albert Stubblebine and how his department, U.S. Army INSCOM and their previous Special Forces Unit, the Intelligence Support Activity, have been historically involved with UAP crash retrieval. In 1984, Stubblebine was replaced as head of INSCOM and went on to serve as vice president for BDM. The following year in 1985, BDM would host an advanced theoretical physics conference to discuss UFO reverse engineering opportunities. And actually, let's not stop there with BDM. In 1989, NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler was introduced to retired rear admiral Sumner Shapiro from Bobby Ray Inman. Inman was then board member of SAIC and Wackenhut and former NSA director and CIA deputy director. I have reason to believe Inman engaged with UAP programs in each of these four positions, but that is not our topic for today. Shapiro told Eschler factions within the U.S. possess extraterrestrial vehicles and that he had even studied one at close quarters. According to Shapiro, teams would take apart craft, pack them up and ship them across the country to different locations. These craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be dissembled in an exact sequence to be put back together. Rear admiral Shapiro was not only former director of naval intelligence, but also BDM international board member at the time, 1989. To this day, Northrop Grumman maintains a major corporate presence in Tyson Corner near the former BDM headquarters. All of this commentary on TRW, Teledyne Ryan, which we will get to shortly in BDM, served to highlight how Northrop Grumman and its many acquisitions interweave intimately with numerous cases we have covered on this channel. If the claims of Philip J. Corso are indeed true, Northrop's modern day legacy program operations can likely trace its roots back to the US Army's golden age of research and development in 1958 to 1962. This would also mean many of Northrop Corporation and Northrop Grumman's acquisitions were to purchase companies that had active, ongoing UFO legacy programs. This sort of context is crucial to establish before we explore whistleblower claims of Northrop's operations in these programs. And last thing before we continue, many individuals think of Lockheed Skunkworks Division when they picture UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs in the private sector. Well, in 1992, Northrop created its own quote unquote answer to Skunkworks. Northrop created the NATDC, Northrop Advanced Technology and Design Center to focus on the company's core key defense programs. While we have already discussed many of NG's acquisitions and their ties to UFO legacy programs from the 1960s to 1990s, let's back up and trace mentions and claims surrounding specifically the Northrop Corporation and later Northrop Grumman. I often think back to the words of US Army Colonel and advisor to US Army Futures Command, Carl Nell, who once stated, Non-human intelligence exists. Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity. This interaction is not new and it's been ongoing. And there are unelected people in the government that are aware of that. And so, Carl, that is quite a bold statement. I'm wondering and I'm curious, how confident are you that that is true? There's zero doubt. Nell has served as an outspoken advocate for David Grush and the existence of technologies of unknown origin. One has to wonder if this absence of doubt arose from Nell's position as Deputy CTO and Director of Systems Engineering and Integration for 13 years on Northrop Grumman. After all, while serving as Northrop's Deputy CTO, Nell was additionally serving as Command Representative to US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Service, US CENTCOM for Army Foreign Material Program. Northrop's earliest contributions to legacy programs may trace back to 1968. MS Can and GM Andrew of Northrop Northair published a paper on the electro aerodynamics in supersonic flow, suggesting Northrop was researching methods to reduce drag of an aircraft by creating an electrostatic field around the craft. This may remind some of T. Townsend-Brown and electro-gravidics. In Nick Cook's excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point, one Dan Marcus is mentioned, a pseudonym for a source in the British aerospace industry. Marcus relayed to Cook that in 2002, the Pentagon pulled the specific paper and, quote, made it disappear, end quote. Marcus would suggest the B-2 Spirit Bomber applied these concepts to employ an electrostatic field around the aircraft to reduce drag. In fact, some UFO researchers such as Michael Schrap and Dr. Richard Boylan take this a step further, suggesting the B-2 employs reverse engineered possibly electro-gravidic technology, leading to the massive cost of the systems. The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye? Aviation Week Space Technology, March 9, 1992, had a very interesting article from people who worked at Northrop who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2 program was not being trickled down to the public industry. They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature. That's what you see in this diagram right here. And then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature. This is the same type of electro-gravidic technology that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s. So this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought. The first true mention of Northrop engaging with NHI technology comes from the work of UFO researcher William Hamilton. Hamilton's book, Cosmic Top Secret, is in my opinion the most underappreciated book in all of ufology. It is a truly excellent piece, decades ahead of its time. For example, the 1992 book makes the first recorded mention of the term ARV and discussion of the Fluxliner, which wouldn't rise to fame until Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure project event. Mind you, Hamilton did misquote the ARV acronym stating Alien Replicated Vehicle instead of Alien Reproduction Vehicle. However, my research has shown Hamilton spoke to Bill Scott of Aviation Week in Space Technology to discuss the Brad Sorenson Fluxliner testimony in the early 90s. The next time someone tries to say Stephen Greer coined the term ARV, send them this passage. And Hamilton actually told Greer about the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show Fluxliner incident and actually passed along both primary witness Sorenson and aerospace illustrator McCandlish to Greer. Hamilton was one of the first to draw serious research to the Antelope Valley, California, near Edwards Air Force Base. Hamilton drew attention to Lockheed's Gunkworks, Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas, and Northrop, all having plants in Palmdale, California. The nation's then chief center of aerospace technology in the middle of these complexes sat Air Force Plant 42, a name many associate with UAP programs. The author of Cosmic Top Secret does not draw attention to the Northrop facility near Palmdale, but instead to a secret underground installation north in the Tujachepe Mountains. Hamilton accuses the Northrop-Tahan Ranch Radar Cross-Section Facility and accompanying underground installation as a UAP program facility. Very little is known about this facility and the underground extension, but let's see what we can dig up. This site officially serves as a radar cross-section range. Quickly, what exactly is a radar cross-section facility? To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves to test aircraft radar signatures. The sites utilize large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar. Many RCS facilities saw construction during the Cold War. This led the majority of installations being built underground to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies away from Soviet spy satellites. In Cosmic Top Secret, William Hamilton discussed numerous statements recounted to him, such as a 1988 sighting of a giant boomerang over the Northrop facility and a flying saucer seen taking off from a building on the property. The Northrop RCS facility has recorded several anomalous sightings throughout history, oftentimes glowing orbs seen around the facility. According to some researchers, the facility sees a disproportionate amount of sightings compared to the Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities nearby. And this isn't the first time I've discussed this Northrop location. Remember back to my work on the Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle, the XF-131 Super Sentinel. Let's reference forensic artist Bill McDonald's 1992 piece, the Tuhachibi Triangle, in which the artist drew a reverse-engineered triangular craft detailed to him by disgruntled engineers from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The engineers hailed from the Northrop RCS facility at Tehan and Lockheed Martin-Hellendale RCS plant. According to their testimonies, the facilities doubled as UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation locations. If you have not seen this investigation, I highly recommend watching as the XF-131 Super Sentinel is absolutely fascinating research. And RCS locations have actually seen much discussion in ufology. With the contentious Steven Greer in particular, labeling the Hellendale plant as a staging ground for electro-gravitic ARV, and a forward operating base employing EMP weapons for ARV testing and downing of non-human vehicles. Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it. I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive. So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway. It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out. They go up and they hover, they're silent, they're electro-gravitic, anti-grab. The diamond on the left, you see that it looks like a runway with a diamond? It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic, they just go boom up. But they're placed over different diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these who don't have time to go through. And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict. Now this may seem extreme, but there is quite a bit of valid research to discuss weapons that have been designed to down UAP. But what more can we factually learn about the underground portion of the Tehan RCS facility? The Northrop site would then be discussed in Dr. Richard Sodder's excellent book, Underground Bases and Tunnels, which takes an evidence-based approach to studying subterranean facilities, aka deep underground military bases, DUMMS. This is my absolute favorite book on the subject of DUMMS as Sodder tackles the subject often associated with conspiracies with rigorous fact-based research. Sodder states Northrop alongside numerous Fortune 500 companies such as Lockheed Martin employ high-tech underground centers in California and claims with a high degree of certainty these facilities are, quote, equally engaged in non-conventional high-tech aerospace research, end quote. Dr. Sodder is equally confident the underground portion of the Northrop RCS facility engages in the same non-conventional research, but is unsure just how far beneath the Earth Northrop's activities extend. Rumors persist under the site there exist as many as 42 underground levels and connective tunnels to nearby facilities as well as Edwards Air Force Base. The validity and very real existence of these locations and tunnels will be another topic for another day as there is quite a volume of valuable research to speak to the legitimacy of interconnected deep underground military bases. Because yes, I do plan on using Dr. Sodder's research for a full deep dive into DUMMS. But I would just like to say that TRW, Northrop's golden child, also has a storied history in connected subterranean facilities. In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. National Committee on Tunneling Technology, USNC slash TT, conducted myriad studies, reports, and patents on underground ICBM-based design, tunneling technologies, tunnel boring machines, tunnel depths, et cetera. TRW engaged and published a number of studies determining the viability of high-speed ground transportation tunnel design. For example, we can analyze this 1968 report where TRW discusses high-speed underground transportation vehicles in tunnel diameters ranging from 80 to 40 feet. At a depth of 400 to 2,500 feet. Another topic for another day, as I stated. Analyzing McDonald, Sodder, and Hamilton, the question must be asked, does Northrop Grumman test and operate reverse engineered NHI vehicles? Out of an underground facility beneath the Tehan RCS site, the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS locations do, after all, reside in close proximity to Edwards Air Force Base, the former Norton Air Force Base, and Palmdale, USAF Plant 42. Norton and Plant 42 are integral pieces to the Fluxliner ARV testimony of Brad Sorensen and Mark McCandlish. And carefully connecting research and analyzing the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Ed, I have accused Edwards Air Force Base and their 412th test group, as running a UFO reverse engineering testing program between Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range. Several testimonies over the decades, outside of Echler, Miller, and McDonald's four anonymous engineers have labeled Northrop Grumman directly, as participating in UFO crash retrieval, reverse engineering, and material exploitation. Many will recall the testimony of Edgar Fouchet and the TR-3B reverse engineer triangular craft. Many write off Fouchet due to the absence of hard physical proof of his claims. However, I do highly recommend viewing my piece on triangle ARVs in general, as a tremendous amount of research resulted from Fouchet's disclosures. The 250 foot prototype and 600 foot operational TR-3B models according to Fouchet saw test flights over Edwards Air Force Base, conducted by the AFFTC Air Force Test Center, which oddly enough operates under the 412th test group which we discussed above. Strange as near Edwards, where these test flights allegedly occur, Northrop has nearby installations, both near Palmdale, USAF Plant 42, as well as a mysterious underground location where anomalous craft have been reported over the decades. Fouchet also outright named the contractors responsible for the construction of TR-3B. FFRDC's Sandia and Livermore Labs reverse engineer the propulsion device. But the primary contractors of the project were listed as Lockheed, Boeing, Teledyne Ryan, and Northrop. I would now like to shift to a fascinating few details from the whistleblower testimony of Colonel Steve Wilson. Wilson's testimony was made public around 1997, shortly before his death, through researcher Dr. Richard Boylan. Boylan has historically published some claims I approach with skepticism, so I tried multiple times to connect with him regarding Wilson, but have heard nothing. Colonel Steve Wilson does deserve his own video as this enigmatic figure is well worth investigating. And disclaimer, we cannot 100% prove Wilson's 40-year military background, as numerous articles exist on the web detailing his DD-214 in education, training, and medals. However, we do not have any scans or copies of Wilson's official records or images of him in service. For this reason, I do also recommend reading Kevin Randall's skeptical take on Wilson and Boylan's reporting, which raises concerns, such as 40 years of service listed on Wilson's DD-214, as well as seemingly misreported medals. To summarize Wilson's disclosures, Wilson claimed in 1963 as a captain in the tactical fighter squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He was assigned to the Majestic 12 and promoted to Major. Here, the then Major learned of the Majestic 12's modus operandi to control, quote, UFO surveillance and interdictions, retrievals, and analysis of records of extraterrestrial spacecraft and occupants, and public access to any information about these matters, end quote. As part of his duties, Wilson would be assigned to the First Special Forces Air Command, and would undergrow special training with Delta Force and the then Black Berets. For nine years, Colonel Wilson claimed to visit nearly every Air Force Base in the world and make contact with key people for the Majestic 12 unit. Wilson states, whilst a Lieutenant Colonel in 1972, he was reassigned from First Special Forces Air Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to Area S-4, near Papouse Lake, south of Area 51, by men with CIA credentials. I am skipping a tremendous amount of detail here, as this is not our subject for today, but Wilson would travel 30 stories underground in the facility where he witnessed eight different kinds of non-human craft, as well as an extremely tall woman that appeared to be extraterrestrial. According to Wilson, S-4 operated to test anti-gravity reverse engineered vehicles. The first successful flight had allegedly occurred on July 18, 1971, a year before his station, which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test. Interesting connection to Echler, Inman, and Shapiro, as we stated above. After some time at S-4, Wilson would claim to head Project Pounce, an elite Air Force NRO Special Forces unit which retrieved downed UFOs. Oddly enough, Project Pounce can be observed in the disputed Majestic 12 Project Aquarius document and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report. Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel to reduce public concern regarding UFOs. So, Wilson has a big, unprovable testimony. What does any of this have to do with Northrop Grumman? In his disclosures to Dr. Boylan, Wilson additionally named US Aerospace Vehicles that had been created utilizing reverse engineered non-human technology. Many of these vehicles would feature anti-gravity systems, and after all of the research we've done on this channel and the words of Jake Barber, maybe this isn't so far-fetched. The implications of what you're saying also are that potentially there is some kind of capacity to draw incredible amounts of energy from the quantum vacuum. I've seen it. You've seen it. I've seen it. There's also, obviously, the capacity to use propulsion systems that are far beyond what we're describing. Yeah, that seems to be the case as well. Anti-gravity. Anti-gravity. They know about it. Anti-gravity, zero point energy. Those secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge. Wilson would state US clandestine military operations began flying the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle, but also discussed an anti-gravity disc that glowed intense orange-golden during flight. Wilson claimed this craft was made by Northrop Aerospace at their secret facility northeast of Lancaster, California. This location is quite interesting, as it matches the underground Northrop range we discussed earlier in this investigation. Wilson would even state the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities were connected alongside Area 51 and other sensitive locations via underground train systems. Wilson claimed these tunnels were excavated by nuclear subterranes, which is actually very interesting. Nuclear subterranes are massive tunneling machines that work by melting rock with heat supplied via a compact nuclear reactor. Numerous patents for such machines were designed by Los Alamos National Laboratories in the 1970s, and don't worry, we will fully dive into this in the dumb video. Boylan had reportedly witnessed this craft in test flight over Area 51 in the Northrop complex near Edwards, dubbing it Northrop's Great Pumpkin Disk. These two siding locations are another fascinating connection to EDD, and the joint reverse engineering effort between Edwards, contractors, and Area 51. Wilson made additional mentions to a reverse engineered craft designated the XH-75D, or the XH Shark. This craft is allegedly an anti-gravity helicopter designed by Teledyne Ryan San Diego Division. Wilson claimed these craft were assigned to Delta IV slash the NRO for UFO crash retrievals. This mention of NRO and Delta is indeed intriguing. Delta Force, part of the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, has been accused of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals under the CIA Office of Global Access, as has indeed the NRO. In fact, the NRO was one of two intelligence agencies, the other being the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency we discussed above with C4ISR. David Grush worked on as liaison to the UAP Task Force, where he discovered the existence of UAP legacy programs. The NRO was also one of three intelligence agencies alongside the CIA and NSA mentioned by Edgar Fuchet as managing the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle. Very little has been discussed on this craft, the XH-75D, original drawing by Wilson on screen now. And almost no actionable investigation can arise from Wilson's incredibly brief testimony on this craft. The Colonel never discussed the intended application or function of the onboard anti-gravity system. What I do find interesting is a 2019 design concept created by one of Lockheed Martin's subsidiaries, the Sikorsky Raider X. Dual rotor helicopters are not rare. They are often implemented on helicopters designed for heavy lift. One would have to ask why the XH-75D would need dual rotors with an anti-gravity system. But the Raider X, canceled in 24, sought to create a quote, agile, survivable compound coaxial helicopter that will equip future aviators to address evolving peer and near-peer threats in the most difficult environments, end quote. No further linkages beyond design exist between these platforms. However, I do find it interesting the XH-75D, drawn by Wilson in 97, looks almost identical to the concept craft proposed by Lockheed in 2019. So is the anti-gravity disk in helicopter proposed by Wilson real? Well, this is unfortunately a dead end of investigation. As I said, Wilson's testimony must be considered little more than third-party research. Because while it is fascinating and ties intimately to some claims made regarding UAP Legacy Recovery programs throughout history, there is little evidence or actionable data to pursue. I would, however, like to leave discussion of Wilson with a chart he made regarding the structure of UAP Legacy programs. Please note, the rendition I am showing now is a recreation of Wilson's 97 chart published in 2001. Numerous spelling errors can be observed here, such as in Lockheed. This chart is titled Star Wars City in reference to the Strategic Defense Initiative, the program we mentioned above, and a program I have discussed many times, instituted by Reagan in the 1980s with possible ties to Eisenhower. To state again, the SDI program instituted to protect the United States from ballistic nuclear attacks has been referenced by numerous witnesses who have stated the program had a backdoor functionality to act offensively against UAP and back-channeled funds to fund UFO Legacy programs. From the chart, Star Wars City located under the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado Springs, Colorado, oversees the U.S. Space Counterintelligence Headquarters within the SDI as the nexus of UAP Legacy programs. Within this chart, there are numerous institutions one might expect to be associated with UAP retrieval and exploitation programs, the NRO, National Security Council, National Security Agency, CIA, NORAD, and Majestic 12. Adhering to the SDI, Colorado HQ, and Magi, there exists a list of contractors alleged to engage with the UAP portfolio. Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and IBM are mentioned. We also find Decision Science Applications Inc. DSAI was led by former Admiral and recurring character of this project, Bobby Ray Inman, and most likely had its assets handed over to SAIC. A contractor I believe is as involved in legacy operations as Northrop or Lockheed. Another project for another day, as DSAI is quite a worthy investigation. DSI, according to the chart and Wilson's testimony, consists of directors of relevant UAP black budget divisions from the aforementioned contractors, as well as Ford Aerospace, which is now part of Northrop Grumman, and Teledyne Ryan, which was one of Northrop's premium purchases. When Teledyne Ryan did indeed play a vital role in the Strategic Defense Initiative, the contractor was well regarded for designing and producing high-performance aerial targets, which were crucial for testing and evaluation potential for missile defense systems, as well as developing advanced sensors that could be used for detecting and tracking incoming ballistic missiles. TRW, Northrop's crown jewel, additionally aided in the SDI program, such as using its locations for high-powered chemical laser testing. And as we mentioned above, Northrop itself takes great pride in aiding in the SDI program in 1983, creating the first laser radar used in space. It is fascinating, even in a testimony like Wilson's, we can still find links to Northrop's many acquisitions and UAP legacy programs. And now onto a whistleblower by the acronym of A-H that appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document. And I must state again, regarding Greer's witnesses, let us analyze the quality and claims of the whistleblower instead of the platform. Unfortunately, Greer's poor operational security is ever-present, as clips of A-H are listed in the DPI archive as Arnold House. I believe I have located this individual and have reached out to talk to him. I have heard nothing. Arnold's testimony revolves around the significant information he gained regarding UAP programs while a surface technician at the Boeing Aerospace Company, as well as insights gained from friend and four-star general, Curtis LeMay. As we dive in, it is crucial to maintain awareness how his disclosures are indeed secondhand. As far as his testimony, House never participated directly in program operations. His information was handed to him from friends at NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, Office of Naval Intelligence Area 51, USAF, Northrop, Boeing, and various generals. This information was so complete, according to Greer, House briefed Bill Clinton in 1990. I have no evidence to confirm this briefing. The only possible link I can find is a letter to Clinton from Greer marked 9 July 2000, where Greer requested the city president to disclose UFO-related USAPs at the suggestion of their mutual friend. I do find House very worthy of discussion as we can find correspondences with him and Greer as recently as 2018 and as old as December 2000. Perhaps House, like William Hamilton, has served as one of Greer's primary sources of information over the decades. In his taped testimony linked in description, House stated one day around 1987 at the home of General Curtis LeMay, the infamous general confirmed the Roswell, New Mexico crash. House also learned from his NSA friend that Henry Kissinger, George Bush, as well as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the UAP subject. His friends in CIA relayed to House that they, along with USAF, had downed NHI craft. Arnold even claimed he learned from a friend in the FBI that the Bureau had radar testing that was causing interference with some of the craft resulting in crashes. This echoes Lieutenant Colonel Corso's sentiments regarding the crash of the Roswell, New Mexico craft. House also learned and relayed there are underground bases testing and maintaining TUOs, likely Dugway, Palmdale, California, Edwards Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and others. Interesting we see Palmdale and Edwards pop up once again. But now let's focus directly on Arnold's information regarding Northrop. House's entire testimony could lead to an entire video so maybe we will save that for whistleblowers volume 3. A.H. stated while at Boeing he met a man in the Army Criminal Investigation Division, CID, who was involved in several crash recovery since 1947 and had served in Army CIC, Counter Intelligence Corps, Capacity. The gentleman handpicked one of House's friends at the Boeing aircraft company to become part of a UFO crash recovery team in northern New Mexico starting in 1980. This friend of A.H. would somehow relay information regarding his time in legacy program operations from 1980 to 1997, 17 years. The time of these disclosures is not given, however, as investigators we must assume that his friend informed Arnold after leaving program operations in 1997. House's friend was ultimately stationed and helped with reverse engineering efforts and testing of non-human craft at Area 51. He was not working for the U.S. government or military, however. His paychecks during these years in legacy programs came directly from Northrop. The source would illustrate Northrop, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing all engaged in UFO reverse engineering efforts at Area 51. The facility itself from 1980 to 1997 held a tremendous amount of extraterrestrial debris in a containment area. This source would also tell House some of the program was shifted to a location in Utah, likely dugway-proving grounds. They moved most of the stuff from Area 51, at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah. Just basically those companies and of course, Lockheed and Northrop. This is very interesting as USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet said the exact same thing. Some Area 51 legacy programs were relocated to dugway in the early 1990s. I myself have talked about dugway previously and plan to revisit with a contractor witness who claimed to stumble upon a floating saucer craft within a classified testing area on base. Here is where House's testimony regarding Area 51 and Northrop gets really interesting. This same friend told Arnold the A51 program to test NHI vehicles and exploit technological materials was called Project Red Light. There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area and near, this is very funny, it's near Northrop. There's an underground area out there too that he was aware of, but he particularly mentioned and stayed focused on ANZA, California. There's some underground areas up there too that they're researching some of this technology and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light. This should immediately become familiar to many of my viewers as I have referenced this Project Red Light on numerous occasions. I have traced first mention of this project to the files of the late legendary researcher Leonard Stringfield, author of Crash Retrieval Status Reports 1-7 and relayed by excellent researcher Michael Schrat. In a letter dated April 5th, 1980, one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one MH, a witness identity Schrat chose not to disclose. MH allegedly performed radio maintenance at the atomic proving grounds in Nevada during 1961 to 1963, along with top secret radio work for USAF. According to MH, he participated in a top secret operation at Area 51 titled Project Red Light. Test flights were conducted under this project on a recovered UFO shipped from none other than Edwards Air Force Base. The craft was not conventionally powered and stayed silent during operation. Security was so tight on the project, program personnel were rotated every six months. MH claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast American defense contractor encountering difficulties in reverse engineering many of the components comprising the craft. I have drawn a parallel between Red Light and the testimony of Ed. We have referenced numerous times throughout this project, a joint Edwards Area 51 reverse engineering program out of the Edwards 412th Test Group. Well, Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet additionally mentioned Project Red Light. Fouchet claimed he gathered knowledge defense contractor EGNG was awarded an indefinite contract for Project Red Light to support the DOE and military. If you have not heard of EGNG, this is the contractor historically implicated with UAP programs made infamous in the story of Bob Lazar as the contractor that hired him to work out of Site 4. This contract gave EGNG responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified government and military sites. If the testimony of Arnold House and his legacy program connections are indeed true, Northrop Grumman could have indeed served as a project manager for Project Red Light, testing non-human intelligence and alien reproduction vehicles in a joint contractor Edwards 412th Test Group operation. Absolutely incredible links to ponder. We have no project stork, we have no direct mention of Lockheed and so forth but almost in a way I find that a little more intriguing for my research. With Northrop we devoted so much time to look specifically at Northrop Grumman's acquisitions TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM, connections to Aerospace Corporation and FFRDCs and I find this so fascinating how Northrop's involvement outside of mentions of Fuchshe and a couple other mentions here and there and comments from Jack Northrop at the beginning of the video they seem to purchase up buy-up companies that had legacy operations. TRW and its implication in the Wilson Davis Memo and the Phil Pentagon audit that almost outed the senior review group. $200 million today Northrop paid to settle that lawsuit for TRW. Now they acquired them I believe for $6 or $7 billion that's a drop in the bucket but it's interesting that a year after the acquisition Northrop's still okay with you know what TRW you're implicated in this massive lawsuit but don't worry we'll pay for it. So I find that sort of research absolutely scintillating instead of just direct confirmations and direct ties like we had with Lockheed and Battelle. I also find all of the whistleblower testimony of Northrop to be incredibly fast and you know I wouldn't be surprised to see full projects on Steve Wilson and Arnold Howe soon. Like I mentioned I've tried to connect with House because I do believe with a high degree of certainty I have found that individual and Colonel or yeah, Colonel Steve Wilson is no longer with us he passed in 1997 but his testimony is still shrouded in mystery and his legitimacy in USAF is still surrounded in mystery so a lot more to explore there but I find it really interesting from the work of William Hamilton the testimony of AH that there's still these little comments that are ubiquitous around testimony that I still find to be quite accurate mentions of the SDI and UAP Legacy programs mentioned Northrop's involvement in underground facilities mention of underground facilities mentioning you know dating to Fouch\u00e9 as well projects being moved from Area 51 to Dugway Proving Grounds even mentions of Area 51 in Edwards as we see in Arnold Howe's Red Light, Fouch\u00e9, etc. So the question must be asked why is Northrop's involvement in Legacy programs operations so shrouded why do they pass under the radar alongside companies like Boeing and Raytheon while Lockheed Martin, while Battelle these guys, I mean even General Electric to a certain degree are always labeled as the prime contractors well I do have someone of a thesis there I think Battelle bar biological storage at probably Fort Detrick or Fort Belbois is a little bit out of the game they're a little bit said and done I think the three, four primary players if we want to say are Lockheed Boeing who is likely a project manager for operations Northrop and Raytheon I think these are the big guys I think that Lockheed is sort of like a hound dog Lockheed will respond to a beck and call they will do what is required of them they are the loudest in the room etc. I think Lockheed is they will take advantage of a situation and they are opportunists the reason I say this is the 2008 material transfer to OSAP that was blocked by Glenn Gaffney in the CIA directorate of science and technology Lockheed itself offered to divest itself of materials now was this to get in the good graces of the CIA the OGA, the DS&amp;T the NRO probably did Lockheed give up materials they could reverse engineer Lockheed give away materials they think that any other corporation or agency could reverse engineer and garner insights from probably not this was probably materials they thought well if we can't figure it out no one else can so we might as well get in good favor with some people and get rid of these materials which is likely from the 1953 Kigman, Arizona crash but that's a whole other conversation Northrop their work seems to be shrouded in much more secrecy they are not offering to divest themselves of material they are often seen in the shadows they are often tag-lined in testimonies like Fouche's as the person in the shadows so that makes the question what work are they doing well I believe it's material exploitation reverse engineering and testing of ARV and likely project managerial responsibilities for the red light project if that is still ongoing or if that has shifted since Ed's time around Nellis and Edwards ending in about 2006 to 2008 so if that project is still ongoing I think that Lockheed operates similar to and I forgot one on the Mount Rushmore of Legacy operations SAIC I think Northrop alongside Lockheed alongside SAIC Boeing and perhaps Raytheon they operate across all segments of US military have commented numerous times that the Army, the Air Force and the Navy their programs are extremely compartmentalized stove piped as Eric Davis said and don't really have much interaction with each other the common threads here are the contractors that interact in programs across compartments and possibly the UARCs and FFRDCs that do as well there might be some small contractors that help out with Air Force responsibilities and one such company might be Alien Science and Technologies helping Ed and the project red light if you want to call it that out at Edwards but the project managers the companies that seem to do quite a bit then engage in all facets of legacy program operations operate across all of these boards so is Northrop still ongoing in research I would probably say yes and Northrop has is up to their eyeballs just like SAIC like Lockheed and just like Boeing but these are my personal opinions I think that even though much of the research we have studied today is still whistleblower testimony and a bit nebulous at some points like Steve Wilson I still think there are numerous fascinating ties I mean again I want to harken back to Northrop's many acquisitions and even date that back to Sparey Rand when it went defunct its departments going to Northrop Grumman and Lockheed and others and connections to the Corso testimony all of these neat little threads that kind of tie Northrop and its purchasing streak interwoven into stories of legacy program operations it's very fascinating in a sense this project was almost a little bit more conclusive to me than even Lockheed or Battelle I would like to know what everybody else here thinks you know perhaps Northrop silence is a sign of danger we don't know all we can do is continue to investigate and if you have any other insights into Northrop or testimony I would love to hear from you and to tell me what you think in the comments with that guys we will move on because I think I've been ranting out for about 8 minutes please remember to like and subscribe always look forward to the next project we'll get back in live soon because I would like to talk a little bit about concurring events you know with the whistleblower testimony of Jake Barber Dr. John Blitch Don Paul Bales and so forth and Fred Baker but I don't want to make that my channel I'm not a news of the day type of guy as you all know you know there's a lot of space between the videos so we'll figure out something there so please remember to like and subscribe guys I do have a patreon you can find that on the channel page I don't gate keep content all of my research as everybody knows is open source so only support what you think the channel is worth you're not getting much extra there it's just go help me out make these investigations purchasing better camera equipment because as everybody can see this camera isn't great and you know maybe funding my trips to go speak to witnesses which I do plan to do quite soon so thank you so much again for joining me and I will catch everybody on the next show later everybody

These whistleblowers can be of ironclad reputation like David Grusch, bound by legal testimony like Robert Salas, or have interesting stories with no real evidence like Bob Lazar.</p> <p>Today's video focuses on two former US Army veterans - 1st Lt. Walter Haut and white House Signaling Agency Army Technician Stephen Loveking.</p> <p>Haut served as the public relations officer for the 509th Bomb Group out of Roswell Army Air Field during 1947. His testimony surrounds the most famous and discussed alleged UFO crash in human history - the Roswell crash. Haut's two signed affidavits and other relevant testimony help to paint a picture of how the USG and General Ramey reacted to and changed the narrative around Roswell to that of a recovered Weather Balloon. Haut additionally has astonishing first-hand encounters of the Roswell wreckage, craft, and beings recovered....</p> <p>Stephen Lovekin served in the White House Signaling Agency during the terms of Eisenhower and Kennedy. During his time close to the White House, Lovekin gained key insights into the interworkings of Project Blue Book, and how the public, declassified report reflected none of the images, cases, terminology, etc that made its way to the public. Lovekin also claims to have first-hand experience with wreckage and bodies from the 1947 Roswell Crash. Lovekin's testimony can help shed light on the famous speech surrounding the \"Military Industrial Complex\" by Eisenhower. He claims that once read into the UAP estimate, Eisenhower was phased out of USG UFO programs. This is where the legacy program Grusch speaks of spiraled out of control, free of congressional oversight. </p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:45 1st.

This case has a tremendously fascinating story and rich lore dating back to the Fascist Regime of Benito Mussolini.</p> <p>Italian UFO Researcher Roberto Pinotti came into possession of official fascist internal documents in the late 90s that spelled out the story of the Magenta UAP collection. These documents included telegrams, memorandums, and handwritten notes that tell of the sophisticated disinformation tactics utilized to keep the UFO retrieval secret as well as the establishment of a scientific coalition codenamed the RS/33.

You say it's a 90 year cover-up. Just about, yeah. 90 years? 1933 was the first recovery in Europe, in Magenta, Italy. They recovered a partially intact vehicle. It's true, it's real. Yeah, that actually happened. Italian government moved it to a secure air base in Italy for the rest of kind of the fascist regime until 1944-1945, and the Pope Pius XII back-channeled that. So the Vatican was involved. Yeah, and told the Americans what the Italians had, and we ended up scooping it. So let me be very clear about this. You're saying that the Catholic Church, the Vatican, they know about the existence of non-human intelligence on this planet. Certainly. It didn't start or end with Roswell. The first traceable recovery of a UFO occurred 14 years before the infamous cover-up in the desert sands of Nevada. In fact, in direct statements made by both David Grush and Lui Elizondo, the first NHI craft to be forcibly taken by U.S. forces would arise from the smoldering remains of the Italian fascist state, led by none other than bonito Mussolini during the Second World War. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and today we are going to discuss the now infamous 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO crash retrieval. This tale is both intriguing and perplexing, featuring a rich document trail and fascinating historical connections to the regime of Mussolini and the Vatican. Why did Grush specifically reference this case to Ross Colthart in his News Nation article? Buckle up guys, because today we are going to dive right into the Magenta UFO retrieval. Before we do any sort of investigation, let's discuss the story, and guys, please forgive any butchering of Italian words or names that I use. In June of 1933, 14 years before the Roswell crash, an unknown craft crashed or landed at Magenta, just west of Milan, Italy. The craft was reported to be bell-like, almost resembling a mix between a flying saucer and the Glock, the legendary mythical alleged Nazi wonder weapon. The craft sat at a reported 10 meters in diameter. Dictator bonito Mussolini thought this was an unconventional flying vehicle that originated from France, Britain, or Germany, but the Italian government established a top-secret group, the Gaminetto Ricciare specialise 33, or how I'll refer to it from now on so you don't make me say that again, the RS33 to examine the craft. This top-secret group was actually headed by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, and Foreign Minister Gallezo Siano, Air Marshal Italo Balbo, with scientific support from astronomer Gino Saccini and possibly senator and founder of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi himself initially resisted Mussolini's terrestrial claims, believing the craft to be extraterrestrial in origin. The craft and its debris was reportedly stored in the hangars of the SIAI Marchetti Aircraft Company in Virgiate Varese. Journalists were ordered to keep silent about the incident due to national security, citing strict dissemination of information by the Agenzi Stefani, Italy's state propaganda papers. The UFO remained in the possession of Mussolini's regime until the fall of the Axis powers and was recovered by US agents of the Office of Strategic Services in 1944 or 1945, and this was the former US intelligence agency. The magenta case was brought to light by Italian UFO researcher Roberto Pinotti, who in 1996 received original Italian secret documents from the fascist regime, containing both protocol on how to handle the craft discovery, as well as internal Italian government notes on UFO sightings from 1933 to 1940. The document consisted of both telegrams and handwritten notes. The sender chose to remain anonymous to Pinotti, going only by Mr. X, the did claim to have inherited them from a family member who worked on Mussolini's supposed UFO program. Roberto received a series of three internal Italian government telegrams relating to the craft. Let's review each one. In our first telegram, we see the telegram is sent by the director of special affairs of the Stefani news agency, the only agency of the Mussolini regime, as an official telegram of Milan. The priority of the telegram is labeled lampo, or highest, with a reservatissimo, a confidential rating. The telegram reads, quote, by order of the duce, the leader, absolute silence is ordered of the presumed landing of an unknown aircraft on national soil. The version is to be published with today's dispatch is confirmed. The same version also applies to personnel and journalists. Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the state security court. Please confirm receipt immediately. Our second telegram was set on the 13th of June 1933 at 4 p.m. again from the Stefani news agency, with lampo priority and reservatissimo classification. This document reads, quote, by superior order, the news disclosed today in the Stefani dispatch number 63 slash 3 slash 1 dot 0 should be treated as follows. The above mentioned aircraft has been recognized as a meteor by the Barrera Astronomical Observatory. Given the news, the slightest graphic relevance, there is no need to rectify, minimize. And finally, our third telegram was sent the same day, the 13th of June 1933 with the same priority classification and sender this time at 507 p.m. This telegram reads, quote, by order of the leader, it is ordered that circulation of the news about the craft of unknown nature referred to in today's Stefani dispatch at 7 30 a.m. be stopped immediately. It is ordered that any leads for newspapers carrying this news be recast immediately. Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the state security court, please confirm receipt immediately. So with these three telegrams, we see the Italian press demand absolute silence over a landing of an unknown craft. Immediate arrest and maximum penalties were to be issued to any journalist commenting on the craft. From the telegrams, we can see the Italian propaganda initially pushed for journalists to treat the landing of the craft as an identified meteor. Only to swiftly cease any and all reporting by Italian journalists. Does this not sound awfully similar to the Roswell incident? Quick media control to drown out the presence of a crashed UFO? If you look at the second and third telegrams I've shown you, you will notice an r slash s stamp in the telegram text field. Unfortunately, I can't find any sharp enough images to decipher what exactly the text on this field reads. However, remember in the description of the alleged magenta craft? A top secret scientific coalition was formed to investigate the craft named the gabinetto richerce speciale 33 or the RS 33. In other words, the special group of 1933. Well, within the document sent to Pinotti, we see an introduction directly mentioning the RS 33 as a prelude to two sheets describing protocol for the crash. Atop the letter in two pages lies the stamp of the Kingdom Senate. This intro to this protocol memorandum has been translated by Paulo Guisardi and reads, quote, Dear DeSanti, I am sending you as requested and agreed verbally the note for your rule. Do not make copies. Do not even mention it to your deputy. For any matter having to do with the RS 33 office, come to me first. I personally wrote these lines as to not expose them to the eyes of my secretaries, therefore adjust accordingly. So who is this DeSanti and who are the figures I mentioned earlier as connected with the RS 33? DeSanti, the man to which the craft recovery protocol was addressed, was almost assuredly a pseudonym for one Tommaso David, a colonel of the Frossinone founder of the Volpi Argentante spy group and later head of the Salo Secret Service, as discovered by Italian historian Arrigo Petaccio. Earlier, I mentioned the possible connection of Guglielmo Marconi to the RS 33, the Nobel Prize winning inventor of the radio. Marconi was an outspoken advocate for belief in extraterrestrials, pursuing the possibility of contacting them via radio, as outlined in a rare article published in 1937 titled, Guglielmo Marconi, Magician of the Invisible Ruler of Spaces by La Stella Mario, which itself referenced earlier claims by Marconi in 1920 and 1932. At this time in 1933, the strict propaganda machine of the Stefani as mentioned earlier would cover everything under the regime bar the highest authorities, Benito Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and Air Marshal Balbo. Due to this, it stands to reason the two men besides the Duce would be read into the top secret RS 33. Ciano's likely involvement in RS 33 and direct naming in the fascist UFO sightings post-magenta will become apparent later in the video. It is worth mentioning the famous Ciano diaries that describe Ciano's experience and involvement within fascist Italy up to his execution in 1943, makes no mention of this secret group. However, it is understandable given the top secrecy of this commission. What is interesting, however, is a deep rabbit hole between Eta Ciano, Ciano's wife and Mussolini's daughter, Alan W. Doles, the Ciano diaries and Operation Sunrise. As a front to retrieve the magenta UFO from the crumbling fascist state, this is not my research, so I will not pass it off as my own. However, if you guys are interested, I will see if I can do an interview with the really sharp cat who has spent countless hours digging into the craft retrieval process by the United States. Now onto the mentioned memorandum describing craft recovery to DeSanti in conjunction with the RS 33. We see these labeled personal note, very confidential, so let's go through all nine steps of protocol surrounding the magenta retrieval. One, notify the mayor. Two, order the immediate recovery of the aircraft. Three, order immediate arrest of all witnesses. Appoint Special Section RS 33 of the OVRA, the Italian Gestapo, present in each provincial capital. Four, direct all reports with the utmost secrecy and precedence over all priorities to the Central Meteorological Office at La Sapienza University in Rome, exclusive relevance RS 33 office. Five, to prevent ex-officio the dissemination of any news particularly in the press. Six, for the purpose of the previous point, it is necessary to publish from time to time very short articles in which the phenomenon is reported to its authentic and unique celestial nature. Meteor, shooting star, planet, luminous halo, iris, etc., according to form RS 33.fz.4 previously transmitted to all the prefectures of the kingdom by special dispatch. Seven, transmission of reports to the Air Force is subject to the prior favorable opinion of the RS 33 office, whose decisions are unappealable up to the highest hierarchy of the duce. Eight, strict exclusion of any other scientific body from the collection and examination of the reports available, including the Pontifical University. And nine, charge all expenses related to this provision to CAP 32 title XXII heading 32-2 of the order to the R-Academia di Italia, written authorization from Chief of Staff RS 33. And a couple thoughts here guys, points eight and nine sound like protocol almost identical to USAF regulation 200-2 from 1953, which I talk about all the time in which UFO sightings were delegated strictly to the Air Force or higher authorities while restricting cases to be shared with scientific bodies of Project Blue Book. And all of this operating protocol sounds extremely similar to the alleged MJ 12 or Majestic 12. If you don't know what that is, it is basically the alleged crash retrieval and reverse engineering group that operates with complete autonomy to investigate NHI within the USG. This is a really rough summary as maybe I need to cover the MJ 12 docs, but the RS 33 sounds like an Italian precursor to the US body that would arise in the late 40s slash early 50s. So, unlike the Stefani telegrams and memorandums, I have no verifiable evidence here for craft storage. But according to the anonymous sender Mr. X, the remains of the craft were stored in the shed of the SIA Marchetti Aeronautical Manufacturing Company. The trail here is incredibly confusing, as sometime during the 1943 year, it is proposed the Nazis took control of the UFO and dissolved the RS 33. A possible link here is that a fire occurred in the SIA warehouse in Virgiat on the 17th of March 1943. The craft likely was then moved to Mussolini's enormous bunker under Mount Serrate, 27 miles north of Rome. At the time of its construction in 1937, the bunker was the largest in Europe, three miles long and 300 feet underground. Rumors circulated the bunker was used to house military equipment, possibly a recovered NHI craft. On the 8th of September 1943, the Germans executed Operation Auxay, disarming all Italian units and commandeering the bunker for the Wehrmacht command for southern Europe. More research needs to be done here to try to find a hard paper trail for the craft, but this is what we're working with for now. An additional piece to this already complex puzzle was included by Mr. X to Pinotti. These included a series of handwritten notes additionally bearing the seal of the Kingdom Senate, describing a UFO encounter titled Mestre. With these is a 1936 Stefani telegram about Mestre stating quote, Absolute secrecy is required about unidentified aircraft mentioned in the 23-47 Confidential Report. A letter will follow. Okay, and on to our letter. We see a curious drawing of a cigar shaped UFO with what appears to be an exhaust tail, not too dissimilar to a rocket engine, followed by two saucers with domes like ping pong balls on top. I'm immediately reminded of the flying saucer as described by Lieutenant Jacobs and the 1948 Chili's Witted Encounter. In this UFO encounter, two American commercial pilots reported their aircraft nearly collided with the UFO over Montgomery, Alabama. The UFO quote looked like a wingless aircraft. It seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare, comically guys Blue Book described this case as a meteor. Anywho, the text on this scribbled handwritten note was thankfully transcribed by the black vault. This reads quote, It was observed in the morning. It was a metallic disc polished and reflecting light with a length of 10 or 12 meters. Two fighter aircraft from a nearby Air Force Base took off, but were not able to reach it even traveling at 130 kilometers per hour. It did not admit any sound, which would lead one to consider an aerostat, a balloon, but nobody knows of balloons that can fly faster than the wind. I know for sure that it was seen by other pilots. The report arrived in the hands of Allegible. Then, after approximately an hour and a half of flying over Mestre, it was seen as a sort of metallic tube, gray or slate in color. A drawing by a confidential informant was redrawn by Andre, who, as far as the two A and B drawings are concerned, explained that A was described as being like a kind of aerial torpedo with very clear windows and with alternating white and red lights. B were two hats, two hats like those used by priests. They were wide, round with a dome in the center, metallic and followed the torpedo without changing their relative positions. The prefecture has opened an inquiry, but you can imagine that it will make little inroads and have a similar outcome to that of the 1931 case. The Duce has expressed his worries, because he says that if it were an English or French aircraft, his foreign policy would have to start all over again. And Italy wasn't just monitoring its own skies at this time. Here we can see from the archives of the prefecture in Milan, copies of telegrams from the prefects of the Kingdom of Italy to the government between 1933 and 1938, mentioning reports of, quote, unconventional flying vehicles, and show the official attention of the Italian authorities to the problem. This telegram, signed by prefect Mutinelli, mentions the presence of unknown flying vehicles over Valona in Albania, a country under Italian control. Of course, every single thing I talked about would be void if the documents were fake, right? Well, fortunately, Pinotti took a skeptical approach when he was first contacted by Mr. X. He had the documents tested by a forensic expert who said the paper and ink was from the period of the 1930s. Additionally, scientific consultant Antonio Garavaglia shared with Daily Mail, quote, it can be stated with reasonable certainty that this sample examined in the subject of the appraisal can be considered original and therefore authentic. Additionally, Italian Reddit user Lowlab5185 was able to lend his hand to the legitimacy of these documents, by not only commenting on the writing style matching the futurism era of fascist communication style but also provided two examples of official telegram templates used by Italian authorities in the 1930s. See the resemblance here. Remember how in both the telegrams and the RS-33 protocol mentioned was made of labeling the craft's landing a meteor or other meteorological phenomena as directed by the Agenzia Stefani? Well, check this out. We can actually find direct reporting of this disinformation. From our telegrams and testimony, we can conclude the crash or landing occurred on the 13th of June 1933. From later that same month, we can find newspapers and magazines that report on inclement weather occurring in the Magenta area, severe lightning storms and hail storms that illuminated the night sky, such as this paper from the 22nd of June, which reported the week prior a lightning strike that illuminated the night sky and struck five bricklayers on the Tricetta Magenta Road, now on screen as a magazine illustration depicting the event. I unfortunately don't have much to go on for the Magenta case connection to the Vatican and Pope Pius XII. We will have to go off the word of David Grush and reporting done by Christopher Sharp predating Grush in his 2021 article All UFO disclosure roads lead to Rome. Sharp writes about how initial relationships between Mussolini and the Catholic priesthood were quite good and how the Duce confided with Pope Pius XII about the retrieved unknown craft. The Pope allegedly became uneasy about the craft being in an Italian possession, as Italy allied with the Nazis, thus leaking information to the US about the craft. Due to the Pope's information, the facility which housed the craft was spared from Allied bombing. This curiously does in fact line up with the bunker serrate we spoke about earlier. After the war or the end of 1944, the craft was brought to the US. Of course, this is all based on reporting and I do not have a paper trail, but Christopher Sharp is a well-respected journalist within the UAP realm. As we stand, we can prove the authenticity of the documents but not yet these anecdotal accounts. And lastly, my friends, as we opened with a powerful statement by David Grush, I would like to leave you with an additionally powerful statement by Lou Elizondo. Kind of gave a few hints before, but Roswell may not have been the first event and well known. I mean, there's been some reporting internationally as well that there have been some crashed vehicles and they were obtained by local authorities and there was some scientific study done on them. I want to be very careful not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but I've seen personally some documentation that's very compelling from a particular foreign country where they had a recovery of a vehicle and they had some countries conducting scientific analysis on it. And after World War II, allegedly, parts of that vehicle were brought to the United States. Yeah, I think I know what country that was. It was in the South American country, I think. Maybe Brazil, you know. Damn it, Argentina? I'm not sure. Well, it was Italy. Yeah, that's as it was explained to me, I saw some documentation. Look, you know, I don't want to get too much into, you know, conspiracy side of the house. There is some documentation that has been validated. That was that was from Mussolini himself. And it's, you know, it's authentic. It's been proven to be authentic the documentation. So certainly interesting. Hey, guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the 1933 Magenta, Italy case. Sorry for the little bit of time away. I had some family in town for their spring break, but now that that's done, we're back in action. Personally, I find this case scintillating. It's the Roswell before Roswell. There's a rich paper trail here as shown by Pinotti. So this is the kind of case I love where we have documents we can dive into. We can cross reference. We can see what's going on with legitimate documentation. So I remember when Grush first went public with his News Nation interview and he referenced this case. I was gobsmacked, as Ross Colthart would like to say. And immediately I dove into learning more and as much as I could about the Magenta case. I find this case particularly compelling, especially the idea that Benito Mussolini, who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, thought this was a craft of British or German or French origin. And I find the description of the clock particularly interesting, this kind of bell shaped saucer type UFO. I know there were some details added later on by one, I think William Brophy or William Brophy's grandson, who claimed that there were bodies uncovered, as we can see in the original documentation. We find no evidence of bodies, so of course I don't want to include those when I don't have any sort of hard evidence. I'm not sure about his claims. I think this man was involved in some other hoaxes, but I purposefully did not include that in today's video. And if you guys are interested, I will talk to the gentleman who has done countless hours of work into finding the connection process as to how the US retrieved the craft. I did not cover this because I could not talk about this without basically copying his work. That would undermine my credibility and undermine the dozens, if not hundreds of hours he has put into pouring through documents. So that's just not how I roll, I respect the man completely, but I would love to cover that if I can get him on the show. As always guys, please remember to like and subscribe. This has been a particularly active week in UFOs with the Arrow Report and the D.D. Johnson FOIA request. So we have a lot to cover coming up guys. Hope you enjoyed this video and I will catch everybody next time. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/FGiwgyLY7Aw/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Air Marshal Balbo</li> <li>Alan W.

So I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the U.K. and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have possession of the hardware associated with this. In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon as to... A craft, a spaceship. Several of them, and they were in operational condition. The paper incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile and a half of water north Atlantic. What had happened, they had picked up a... There's a survey vehicle working in the north Atlantic that had picked up some radioactive signal. It was almost a perfect symmetric piece of metal with marking around the edge and it was just a triangular shape, but no glass, nothing that would appear to be a hatch or a cockpit of any type. From Roswell in 1947 to Jake Barber in 2024, on this channel we have discussed extensively UFO crash retrieval operations performed by UFO legacy programs involving the United States Army and Air Force. Over the past decades, these retrievals are alleged to have occurred over the continental United States, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, the former Soviet Union, China, and numerous lands around the globe. In several U.S. incidents, rapid reaction response teams are detailed to fly in via helicopter, drive in via flatbed truck, or utilize any vehicle system to retrieve non-human craft and transport them to clandestine above and below ground military installations. But what about retrieval operations that must be conducted in the oceans of our planet? What happens when UFOs crash into water or USOs, unidentified submerged objects must be recovered? How are such operations conducted in the most mysterious corners of our planet where only roughly 26% of our oceans floors have been mapped? This would of course require the most powerful seafaring military on the planet, the United States Navy, and it's a measurable special access programs, internal intelligence offices, corporate programs, and partnerships with shadowy U.S. intelligence apparatuses. What does the Navy just retrieve UFO and USOs in our water, or do they, like many retrieval instances we have covered on this channel involving the Army and Air Force, additionally engage in storage, exploitation, and reverse engineering of technologies of unknown origin? For this reason, I want to dive in and explore the modus operandi, operational history, and key players in U.S. UFO Navy legacy programs. On the research we will explore in this project, I theorize naval UFO programs can be delegated to four major components of operation, monitor, collect, store, and exploit. These operations are likely conducted out of the Office of Naval Research and Office of Naval Intelligence in conjunction with U.S. Special Forces Command, SOCOM, shadowy intelligence organizations like the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office and Navy Special Program, and involve U.S. naval stations like NAWC China Lake and NSWC Crane, while engaging with defense contractors and FFRDCs such as Lockheed Martin for utilization of their now-retired deep-submergence rescue vehicles Mystic and Avalon. This investigation will explore in tremendous detail the three components of naval UFO programs I outlined above, UFO and USO collection, NHI craft storage, and technologies of unknown origin, TUO, exploitation. One major cornerstone I theorize exists in naval UFO programs, monitor, will be largely emitted from today's exploration. While the topic of possible undersea UFO bases or installations is well worth investigating in the future, I have covered the topic of USO reports twice already on this channel. These include discussion of OPNAF 3820, a naval regulation restricting maritime UFO reporting. With that being said, let us look beyond the veil to analyze naval UFO legacy programs. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we take a direct investigation into UFO legacy programs under the United States Navy. We will direct our focus on three key pillars relevant to today's discussion, collection, origin, exploitation of non-human craft and technology. In this investigation, we will analyze the alleged structure of naval UFO programs, study key figures associated with said programs, evaluate a handful of incredibly intriguing USO retrieval cases, and identify naval installations alleged to hold non-human craft and biologics. I've been sitting on this information for quite a while now, and I felt quite nervous about it because the retrieval program undertaken by the CIA and elements of the US Navy is probably one of the most highly guarded secrets in the US government, and those protecting it can be quite nasty, and I was warned about that. On 20 September 2024, excellent UK-based journalist Christopher Sharpe in the Liberation Times posted an article titled, quote, Paradigm changing UFO transparency legislation fails in Congress for second consecutive year. The piece discussed the unfortunate dismissal of the UAP Disclosure Act in the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. This exclusion of the UAPDA is another topic for another day as such bombshell legislation could very well have begun the unraveling of UAP legacy program secrecy. The September 20 article pivots rapidly discussing multiple programs orchestrated by the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations, alongside Department of Defense and Department of Energy components that have for decades bypassed democratic oversight to retrieve advanced technologies of unknown origin. If this CIA DS&amp;T sounds familiar to you, it is likely because this CIA component has been accused on myriad occasions by Chris Sharpe and Dr. Eric Davis, as directly participating in and obfuscating data around UFO retrievals. For example, Glenn Gaffney, former CIA DS&amp;T director, has been labeled as the gatekeeper who ceased Lockheed Martin's attempts to divest UFO materials, likely the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash. To the OSAP program in 2008, additionally, former CIA DS&amp;T deputy director Doug Wolfe aided in founding the CIA OGA, or Office of Global Access in 2003. Wolfe and the OGA have been accused by Sharpe and others as participating in retrievals outside of the United States with JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command. Anyways, the 20 September Sharpe article proceeds to detail some truly startling revelations. Quote, Multiple programs are understood to be orchestrated by the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations, including its Maritime Branch, alongside components of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, U.S. Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, Space Command, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and Joint Special Operations Command. According to Liberation Times sources, missions carried out by these programs include the retrieval of objects from beneath the oceans, involving the CIA's Directorate of Operations, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, coordinated between the CIA and U.S. Navy, United States Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Additionally, the retrieval of objects on foreign soil is conducted with the involvement of the CIA's Office of Global Access and Joint Special Operations Command, end quote. Sharpe directly named military and intelligence organizations involved with ocean-based retrieval, including two institutions almost never discussed, the Neuro-National Underwater Reconnaissance Office and WHOI, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. But before we break down these statements, I must detail the evolution of this article as it allows us to study in Chris Sharpe's own words, information detrimental to his safety. By 22 September 2024, the article was revised, redacting all information about the Navy, Neuro, Woods Hole, NGA, NRO, JSOC, etc. The new Bear Bones edition still discussed the CIA, DS&amp;T, DOD, and DOE, but all true actionable data was stripped from the piece. Sharpe was accused by some Twitter users as making quote-unquote stealth edits to remove information from the article, but he responded by stating quote, this is sourced information. There is a real, extremely dangerous reason little information has been released about such programs. Content from the article was removed because of the threats posed to me, end quote. By 25 September 2024, five days after the original posting, Sharpe would once again edit the article and say quote, okay, so someone has recklessly put me at extreme risk, so I have updated last week's article relating to the UAPDA, reverting back to details previously mentioned. This time, the details are far more specific, so here it is, the alleged undersea retrieval program, end quote. This third edit is quite similar to the first piece, but expands on multiple departments and agencies named specialized assets and expertise to carry out undersea craft retrievals. In this latest iteration, Sharpe states for operations, Woods Hole provided deep submergence vehicles to quote support retrieval efforts, end quote. Deep submerged rescue vehicles or DSRV will be a crucial aspect of a USO retrieval operation covered much later on in this project. The third iteration does powerfully claim the undersea craft or quote, transfer to the office of naval research, which subsequently hands them over to defense contractors for detailed analysis, end quote. From this article, we can extract a powerful thesis, the US Navy works in conjunction with the CIA, DS&amp;T, alongside JSOC or SOCOM forces, intelligence agencies such as the NRO, NGA, and shadowy NRO, as well as defense RDT&amp;E facilities and private contractors to retrieve and store non-human craft found deep undersea. But let's really break this down, analyzing the targeted role of the CIA's Office of Global Access alongside JSOC and global soil-based crash retrievals. We can assume a similar structure for undersea retrievals where the CIA, DS&amp;T, serves as the logistics coordinator while JSOC provides men-at-arms, industrial security, human intelligence, etc. In this apparatus, the NRO and NGA would harness reconnaissance satellites to provide SIGINT or signals intelligence to retrieval teams while the shadowy National Underwater Reconnaissance Office provides unknown methods of underwater reconnaissance. In such a system outlined by SHARP, retrieval operations would be done in tandem with the US Navy and contractors such as Lockheed Martin and their DSRV and Dry Submersible, as well as non-profit research facilities such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and their many deep-submergence vehicles. Finally, in this hypothesized naval UFO program, craft would be taken to various Office of Naval Research locations before being transferred to defense contractors to study. But in this program, I do think SHARP is missing a key step here. Many speak on joint USG contractor UFO legacy programs. But a cornerstone of my work has been discussing the missing intermediary, federally funded research and development centers, FFRDCs, and university-affiliated research centers, UARCs. I will not bore returning viewers of these details, but I often speak on how these semi-private government-controlled RDT and E-Centers act as liaison between USG-slash-DOD and US Defense Contractors for UFO Reverse Engineering and Material Exploitation Programs. Such institutions would serve as subject matter experts and provide necessary R&amp;D work on project materials. This would in turn keep knowledge access in T-U-O programs quite strict, only allowing contractor personnel with a need to know full insights into the full extent of the non-human materials on which the programs focus. The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs often entwined with unacknowledged special access programs, special access programs, and controlled access programs. Such UARCs include the Applied Physics Laboratories at John Hopkins University and the University of Washington, as well as the Applied Research Laboratories at the Universities of Hawaii at Minoa, University of Texas at Austin, and Pennsylvania State University. Penn State's UARC was established in 1945 by Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker. Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board Dr. Robert Sarbacher as participating in 1950's UFO retrieval and reverse engineering programs alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush. Walker would be contacted by various UFO researchers in the 1980s and make some startling revelations, not only admitting he himself was present at the 1965 Kexpert, Pennsylvania UFO crash, but also claiming he knew of the Majestic 12 and to engage in UFO legacy programs one would need to know about ESP, Extrasensory Perception. It is interesting how a former TRW board member and founder of Penn State's UARC would essentially confess he was part of a UFO legacy program. And by the way, as recently as 2013 the Office of Naval Research has displayed a keen interest in studying ESP. The O&amp;R would even publish a quote, revolutionary program looking into six cents among humans to train personnel on intuitive decision making, end quote. Additionally, according to the testimony of Randy Anderson, the Navy, specifically the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane and contractor SAIC, has engaged in recovered technologies that respond to human consciousness at the underground off-world technologies division. The Navy also engages in a tremendous roster of programs with FFRDC's Well Worth Our Interest, primarily the Center for Naval Analysis run by the CNA Corporation based out of Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. Returning viewers will recall how a recently implicated Crystal City and a likely massive underground facility beneath a neighborhood in Pentagon as a major center for UFO legacy programs SAPs and USAPs. Many of the acronyms sharp listed in his work regarding undersea retrievals need much further analysis. And as we move forward in this investigation, it is paramount to recognize the Navy has indeed participated in at least one acknowledged USO retrieval operation. Recall the 1962 Bluegill Triple Prime detonation and subsequent UFO recovery discussed by late presidential advisor Harold Malmgren. This event took place during Operation Fishbowl, a series of high altitude nuclear tests. The Bluegill Triple Prime nuclear test accidentally disabled a nearby UFO that went careening into the waters below. The downed craft or quote unquote pod was searched for and recovered by the USS Safeguard. Historical logs from the Safeguard discussed the vessel alongside others such as the USS engage steaming to the water crash location, searching in a square grid pattern and employing divers to recover a quote unquote pod. During net recovery of this pod, the Safeguard actually lost power and the pod was released for helicopter pickup. This is a massively consequential case I would like to explore in more detail later on, but let's continue with this investigation. I would be willing to wager most watching this channel have heard of the National Reconnaissance Officer NRO. The NRO is considered alongside the CIA, NSA, DIA and NGA to be one of the big five US intelligence agencies. This agency within the US DOD has historically designed, built, launched and operated reconnaissance satellites providing signals intelligence to the NSA, imagery intelligence to the NGA and measurement and signature intelligence to the DIA. David Grush worked for both the NRO and NGA where he additionally served as the intelligence agency's liaison to the UAP task force. Since 2023, the NRO has had a provable program that tracks UAP projects sentient uncovered in FOIA documents. Sentient serves as a quote ongoing research and development program and quote that analyzes satellite data with AI capabilities. The program was also tasked with analyzing UAP data such as a six May 2021 incident where a small tic-tac object was detected. The sentient report states this tic-tac to be similar to other objects observed in redacted operating areas. In 2021, the NRO contributed to the ODNI's or Office of the Director of National Intelligence's report to Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committee on Progress made by the UAP task force. This discussion of the NRO and UFOs are interesting, seen as they contradict a 2015 statement made by the NRO which stated that no documentation relating to UFOs and that the topic was quote outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities. Furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches in the past and has located no records end quote. The NRO has of course additionally been implicated in providing assistance for UFO crash retrieval operations. These accusations have been made by Chris Sharp discussed above and witnesses I've covered on this channel numerous times including Stephen Greer witness AH as well as USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet who claimed the NRO alongside the NSA and CIA managed the TR-3B Reverse Engineer Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle. A fascinating document allegedly released by the NRO surfaced in 1991. I have covered this document before in relation to Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team, a possible joint reverse engineering group out of Edwards Air Force Base in the Nevada Test and Training Range. This document is again worth our attention because of the countless groups of interest mentioned throughout. These include MagiOps, Red Flag MOC, Sea Spray SOG, and AquaTech SOG. Allegedly Stephen Greer gave this memo to Admiral Thomas Wilson from the Wilson Davis Notes in a 1997 meeting. This meeting did occur, this is not disputed, however according to Greer Wilson recognized at least one of the clandestine groups listed in this memorandum for record from the NRO. Though the NRO likely works with the CIA, DS&amp;T, and Navy for USO Retrievals they are not our focus for naval legacy programs. The NRO was born based on a recommendation to President Eisenhower during a National Security Council meeting. The agency was formed to coordinate the Air Forces and CIA's reconnaissance activities. Lessor known is an additional agency formed to coordinate the CIA's and Navy's reconnaissance activities, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office. This agency NRO is known as the Hidden Younger Brother of the NRO. Implications about this agency and naval USO retrievals are scant, seen as NRO is a classified black agency, but we will do everything we can to investigate. NRO itself has been widely considered to be a special access program. According to publications made by the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, quote, Most SAPs involve technology projects. At the Department of Defense there are relatively few SAPs involving sensitive human intelligence collection or exploitation methods. Examples of ongoing non-technology SAPs include interrogation protocols for high-level battlefield detainees in Afghanistan managed by the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Center of the DIA. And every single capability of all special mission units of the Joint Special Operations Command, one entire government agency, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, is protected by a SAP, end quote. From this statement we can learn NRO is an extremely rare example of an entire intelligence agency being protected via a special access program. But do not be mistaken, NRO is a very real program and we can find snippets of its very existence here and there including a drastic revelation we will touch on soon. This includes mention of NRO in a 1975 submission of documents to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Included in a long list of National Security Council Intelligence Directives is a National Security Decision Memorandum 40, which details both NRO and NRO operations. According to the Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence by Nigel West, NRO began during the Cold War as a joint Navy CIA group to coordinate and fund special projects conducted by submarines. In his book, the U.S. Intelligence Committee, Jeffrey T. Richardson was able to learn even more about NRO, quote. In 1969, as a result of an agreement between the CIA and U.S. Navy, an underwater counterpart to the NRO, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, NRO, was established. With Secretary of the Navy, John Warner, as its first director, the office served as a means of managing the conduct of submarine intelligence missions and exploitation of their product. Those missions involved the recovery of sunken submarines, the Soviet K-129, taping of the underwater Soviet communication cables, the Ivy Bells, a.k.a. the De Clemson Program, ocean floor mapping under a program named Desktop, an imagery and sighing collection from submarines, a program at one time designated the Special Navy Control Program, end quote. Author Jeffrey T. Richardson was even denied FOIA requests on NRO. From what we can learn, the agency has deployed several highly specialized ships and submarines including the USS Parsh, the Hughes-Glomar Explorer, the USS Halibut, the NR-1, and more recent the USS Jimmy Carter. Of particular note is the United States' first nuclear-powered submarine launched 1969 the same year as NRO's founding and retired in 2008, the NR-1. This sub carried out numerous highly classified missions including search, object recovery, geological survey, oceanographic research and installation and maintenance of underwater equipment. One publicly acknowledged NR-1 mission occurred in 1976 with the recovery of an F-14 lost from an aircraft carrier. NRO seemingly performed operations to swarm a stranded Soviet submarine in 1981 in Swedish In response to statements made by former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stating NRO's submarine operations in Swedish waters were routine defense tests, a senior U.S. official said quote. I don't know why Weinberger said what he did. Covert submarine operations is the most secret thing we have. The decisions were taken by a subcommittee of DIA and CIA people, most likely the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, but I will neither confirm nor deny any operation in Swedish waters end quote. An additional high-ranking CIA officer confirmed with the International Peace Research Institute Oslo that U.S. covert submarine retrieval operations were run in Scandinavian waters by NRO, whilst directed by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman from 1981 to 1987. Analyzing the inception of NRO and the retrieval of the K-129 Soviet submarine as detailed by Jeffrey Richelson, we may gain some keen insights into the organization and their alleged UFO retrieval missions. In Blind Man's Bluff, the untold story of American submarine espionage, NRO was established under CIA Director Richard Helms to address the sinking of the Soviet submarine K-129 outside of Hawaii in 1968. Though the office was intended to act between the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology and Office of Naval Intelligence, quote, from the day NRO was formed, the CIA took charge, end quote. NRO has seemingly seen a tug of war of control through the CIA and Navy, but by 1972 the Navy regained some control of NRO, seeing Secretary of the Navy John Warner serve as its director. However, through NRO, the Navy and CIA DS&amp;T's usage of the GLOMAR Explorer may be worth analyzing more. To address K-129, the CIA built the ship the GLOMAR Explorer mentioned above, which launched in 1972 to recover the sub under Project Jennifer, a.k.a. Project Azorian. Astoundingly, the ship carried a modern-day price tag of $1.68 billion. I would like to thank medium author Underscored for this great piece titled General Motors, GLOMAR Explorer, Lockheed Martin, and UAP Connections. His article will be in the video description. The piece explores the GLOMAR Explorer being involved in hidden programs beyond the scope of K-129 Soviet submarine recovery in 1974, and was additionally used for nearly two decades by Lockheed Martin. Since the ship was a NRO creation, we can reasonably assume these clandestine operations and Lockheed Martin's usage were conducted under NRO. The article discussed how in 1978 Ocean Minerals Company, whose prime contractor was Lockheed Missiles and Space Company now Lockheed Martin, leased the GLOMAR Explorer for quote-unquote deep sea mining operation. The question must be asked, did Lockheed, NRO, and the GLOMAR additionally partake in these undersea UFO retrievals? After all, later in this project, we will address a scintillating 1970s UFO crash retrieval case in which the GLOMAR Explorer allegedly retrieved a downed non-human craft. We will also discuss an incredible 1991 USO recovery in this project, in touch on how I believe NRO provided transportation and logistics assets to the Navy's Project Sand Dollar. The clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve military-sensitive hardware and other items with national security importance from the seafloor of the continental shelf in deepest marine environments. Sand Dollar seemingly gained actionable leverage when in 1964 a chief scientist of the Special Project's Office of the US Navy, Dr. John Pena Craven, launched the Deep Submergence Systems Project which saw the Navy drastically improve deep sea engineering and exploitation capabilities, but much more on this later. The most astonishing discussion of NRO actually comes from a man mentioned dozens of times on this channel who self-admittedly served as its director. Thank you. I became the director of Naval Intelligence, 13 September 1974, brand new flag selectee that year. I also had a second hat, and they still don't want me to talk about it even now, of director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office. See, I think you have it classified. It's the organization that procured all of the sensitive reconnaissance systems to collect intelligence under the surface of the oceans. Bobby Ray Inman allows us an extremely rare opportunity to understand naval UFO slash USO legacy programs as well as the likely involvement of NRO. Inman served as a highly decorated four-star admiral in the US Navy from 1951 to 1982, while also serving as the NSA and CIA director and director of SAIC and Wackenhut. Of course, if you are unfamiliar with these two companies, SAIC is a premier contractor I have discussed and will discuss later in this video as being heavily involved with UFO legacy programs. SAIC was likely the contractor described by former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson as running the Off-World Technologies Division below the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane. Wackenhut was a contracted security company I have covered before that has often times been implicated as providing industrial security forces who have guarded UFO-related SAP locations. And of course, Inman's dual roles within US intelligence and the Navy also suits an organization like NRO perfectly. Anyways, Inman states in the above clip he took a hold of the highly secretive NRO in 1974. Inman had only spoken publicly about NRO once before in an October 2021 interview with David Zerler, the director of the Caltech Heritage Project. At this time, Inman served on Caltech's Board of Trustees to which he had been appointed in 1989 on the behalf of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, and Congress. While discussing JPL's future as a productive national asset working alongside NASA, Inman was reminded of his Navy and NSA days during his tenure in the National Underwater Reconnaissance Program. According to Inman, NRO served as a black program due to its constant need to pursue evolving, cutting-edge technological capabilities to outsmart adversaries. Later on in the interview, Inman touched on his role as director of Naval Intelligence and director of NRO whose very existence was still classified. In Inman's own words, he was harassed for even mentioning the office, quote, In recent years when I talked about it, I got a pretty hot letter telling me I was not permitted to talk in detail since they were all still classified, end quote. According to Inman, NRO was in essence a black program that, quote, Acquired the technology for undersea reconnaissance, ranging from conducting imagery of the ocean floors looking for anything which might be desirable from an intelligence point of view. Before my time, it had been engaged in the efforts to pick up a submarine off the ocean floor with the Glomar Explorer. By the time I took over, it was primarily designed to track the hardware to be used in modern collection activities. The actual missions were conducted by the services, by the U.S. Navy, by the submarine force, by the National Security Agency. I had already been exposed to the Glomar Explorer program when I was in Hawaii as the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, end quote. So from Inman, the U.S. Intelligence Committee in Blind Man's Bluff, we can learn the director of NRO dealt with technology acquisition and was also a high-ranking naval official ranging from Secretary of the Navy to Director of Naval Intelligence. You'll recall how Inman states he was exposed to NRO's Glomar Explorer in Hawaii. In 1974, the K-129 Soviet wreckage was picked up 1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii, however. Once again, later in this project, I will bring up an alleged UFO recovery in 1973, conducted by the Glomar in Hawaii. Could Inman possibly have been involved in this retrieval in an official capacity? But why exactly are these words from Admiral and former NRO director Bobby Ray Inman so important? I have spoken on this topic quite a few times, but as this directly involves U.S. Navy UFO legacy programs, let's dive back in. In 2022, on the Project Unity show, Inman claimed he had found quote-unquote plausible explanations for all UAP sightings. In my years' active service, I became intrigued by the whole issue of UFOs, and as I dug into it, I found there were plausible explanations for virtually everything that we had observed. Still recently, with the openness of Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, naval officials quite often denied the existence of UFOs. This dates all the way back to 1951, where the Office of Naval Research physicist, Ernor Liddell, stated in a public magazine article that all UAP reports were mirages or balloons. He stated trained observers were being fooled. These 2022 statements by Inman contradict much of this man's storied history. I started out extremely skeptical about this whole thing, I thought this was just rubbish from the tabloids, but I was surprised to find thousands of U.S. government documents from intelligence agencies that tended to indicate that there was a little bit more to this than met the eye, so I went to seek guidance from the various highest levels of the United States intelligence community, and I was quite alarmed at what I was able to learn. Now, we are, in this report that we're now going to show, we're going to hear a conversation featuring you. Tell me the context of that conversation. Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security Agency in the United States, Deputy Director at CIA, Director of Naval Intelligence, and a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist, and clearly someone that if this was really accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man who had to know. So I was able to contact him, thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the U.K., and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have possession of the hardware associated with this. In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon. A craft. A spaceship. Several of them, and they were in operational condition, which I assume suggested that they had been in contact, that they had been given these craft for some reason or another, because they certainly weren't crashed vehicles. In a 1989 telephone call, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman would tell NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler, Deputy Director of the CIA, DSNT, Everett Heineman, would be the best person to ask if recovered vehicles would be available for technological research outside of military circles. To quote Inman in this call, quote, the deputy director for science and technology at CIA is named Everett Heineman. He is in fact getting ready to retire in the very near future. That may make him somewhat more willing to have dialogues than he otherwise would have had. When I knew him in that period seven to ten years ago, he was a person of very substantial integrity and just good common sense. So as a place to start, he would clearly be high on the list, end quote. And we actually have recorded snippets of this phone call between Eschler and Inman. Do you anticipate that any of the recovered vehicles would never become available for technological research outside of the military circles? Ten years ago, the answer would have been, whether it's time it evolved, they're beginning to become more open on it, there's a possibility. Eschler would go on to receive this call from Admiral Inman. Mr. Eschler, this is Tom King, an Admiral Inman's office, yet you would be breaching confidence and or violation of the secret three laws and discussing his involvement in any matter. Interesting how Inman, a former neuro director, would refer Eschler to a CIA DS&amp;T director for recovered anomalous vehicles. CIA DS&amp;T was, of course, one half of the founding agencies behind neuro. To note, while Heineman served as CIA DS&amp;T deputy director from 1979 to 1982, he would go on to direct program B in the National Reconnaissance Program from 1982 to 1989. Possibly, this is where a neuro director and NRO program director first encountered UFO legacy programs together. Heineman and Eschler arranged to meet at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, 10 August, 1989. In this meeting, Heineman would deny any knowledge of UFO or UFO legacy programs, however, in 2022, Twitter user RGH underscore UFOs would contact Heineman regarding comments made by Inman that Heineman was knowledgeable on U.S. UFO programs. In this instance, Heineman did not deny, but instead said, quote, I am a long way and quite a few years from working in the area you are researching, end quote. Heineman would offer to answer any questions relating to UFOs, but never responded to RGH, and as of this time, I have additionally attempted to contact Heineman to no response. RGH's inquiries into UFO programs revolved around Heineman's time in the NRO's program B. As we just mentioned above, program B served as the CIA's initiative to build and operate satellites for sigint purposes. Heineman was the first chief of the facility for the ground element of the program in Pine Gap, Australia. It is fascinating to think Heineman could have been working on UFO legacy programs in the 1980s out of the illustrious and infamous Pine Gap for a joint CIA and NRO program. More pertinent to our investigation today, Inman would additionally connect Echler with another former director of Naval Intelligence, Sumner Shapiro. It is unknown if like Inman, Shapiro served on the NRO. In 1989, Echler met Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with the group that managed UFO information, and at this time Shapiro was retired as director of Naval Intelligence and served as an executive with BDM International. BDM is of course a former defense contractor purchased by Northrop Grumman, I directly accused of being involved with UFO legacy programs. Shapiro told Echler factions within the U.S. possess extra-terrestrial vehicles that he, Shapiro, had even studied at close quarters. According to the former DNI, teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them around the country to different laboratories. This craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an exact sequence to be put back together. However, Shapiro was incredibly careful with what information he divulged to Echler, never specifying where vehicles and technology were taken to protect classified information. Echler would meet Shapiro for a second time in the Admiral's Virginia home in 1990. This visit was far less actionable and concluded abruptly. According to Bob Echler, as relayed by author Timothy Good, quote, But before we move on from discussing Echler and insights he gained from senior naval officials, Echler would also claim Navy EMP experiments were utilized out of Pensacola Naval Air Station to down UFOs for retrievals. These involved Empress and Empress II onboard EMP generators. Inman and Shapiro are not the only naval officials who have spoken on UFO legacy programs. In 2021, now deceased former Navy Director of Science and Technology Development, Nats Kobitz told Ross Colthart he was, during his service, read into a Navy UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. Although Kobitz didn't actively engage with TUO or technologies of unknown origin, he was read into an active program that had retrieved multiple UAP. He called me on an open line out of the blue and I could barely believe who he was. His name was Nats Kobitz. He was the US Navy's former long-time director of science and technology development, their chief R&amp;D scientist, their chief geek for many years, for over 30 years. And sadly, when I caught up with him, he was dying from cancer and faked dictated that I caught him at the perfect time. And over several months, he finally opened up to me about what he was on his own admission read into. He was briefed on the program and he told me that he had been read into a classified program involving retrieved non-human technology, recovered alien spacecraft. He eventually admitted that he was officially briefed that America had retrieved multiple non-human craft and that he was aware there was a secret operation underway for decades in his words to undertake to reverse engineer them. He admitted that most of what he knew was effectively hearsay, although from some excellent official sources. This is something he'd been briefed into in his official capacity. He did admit that on one occasion he was flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, literally taken deep underground, taken to a secure room and shown what looked like some kind of bulkhead from a craft which he believed was constructed in a way that defied conventional explanation. The craft's skin and inner bulkhead were composites bonded at an atomic level. He suspected it was non-human intelligence technology. But being the scientist he was infuriatingly, he wouldn't say to me it was alien tech. He would just say it was something he had never seen that any human could make. That was a patriot. He was a decent, honorable public servant. He respected the fact that this program was being kept secret for a reason. But as a scientist, he also recognized that the American public and especially Congress had the right to know what was being done with taxpayer dollars. And he frankly told me that as far as he knew, there was no good justification for keeping it secret. Remember all the way back to Chris Sharpe's mysterious reporting on USO Legacy programs involving the CIA, DSNT, Navy, Neuro, SOCOM and others. To quote Chris in the third iteration of the article, quote, it is further understood that the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has provided deep-submergence vehicles to support these retrieval efforts, end quote. Woods Hole, or WHOI as I will call them here, is quote, dedicated to advancing knowledge of the ocean and its connection with the earth systems through a sustained commitment to excellence in science, engineering and education, and to the application of this knowledge to problems facing society, end quote. The non-profit research and higher education facility is dedicated to the study of marine science and engineering. During the Cold War, 1985 to be exact, the US Navy deployed a classified mission to investigate the wreckage of the USS Thresher and USS Scorpion, which had sunk in the North Atlantic Ocean at depths of between 10,000 and 15,000 feet. Sounds like a neuro-investigation, no? While this mission led to the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, the operational team and vessel that discovered the RMS Titanic was from Woods Hole. WHOI employs a host of highly advanced underwater vehicles that include human-occupied submersibles, remote-controlled vehicles, autonomous and towed robots. These include the AUV Sentry Autonomous Exploration Vehicle capable of exploring depths of nearly 20,000 feet or 6,000 meters, the HOV Alvin, a three-person research submersible, and the HOV Deepsea Challenger used by filmmaker James Cameron. WHOI works closely with US military, specifically the Navy, where it develops technology including ocean battle space sensors, unmanned undersea vehicles, and acoustic navigation and comm systems. As a matter of fact, going back decades Woods Hole was involved with the Atomic Energy Commission, the precursor to the Department of Energy that highly likely housed UFO legacy programs while also serving as the gatekeepers for UFO data and materials, misclassifying such as trans-classified foreign nuclear material. From 1948 to 1949, a gentleman named William Webster served on the Military Liaison Committee for the Atomic Energy Commission. Webster was not only a member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation, but was also a trustee of the Rand Corporation and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. WHOI even manages the Navy Oceanographic Research Laboratory for the Department of the Navy. This WHOI lab is now part of the Naval Research Laboratory NRL, however, the National Oceanographic Research Laboratory was formed by a Federal Contract Research Center, or FCRC, the precursor to FFRDC, which I talk about quite often. Present day, Woods Hole also manages projects for the Office of Naval Research, such as Project Sundance. In fact, since 2002, Woods Hole has been awarded over $3.4 billion in federal awards in the form of contracts, subcontracts, and grants. Analyzing such contracts, we can find some data of extreme interest, such as National Defense R&amp;D Services with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, whose crane division I have directly accused runs an underground installation with Science Applications International Corporation, housing the Off-World Technologies Division. Historically, WHOI has been awarded these contracts by NSWC via sole-source contracts, a contract method Dr. Eric Davis has spoken of, that are used in UFO legacy programs to maintain compartmentalization and secrecy. Woods Hole is given such sole-source, indefinite delivery contracts because, quote, the government believes that the supplier has unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained, end quote. And speaking of SAIC, Woods Hole has also been granted R&amp;D contracts with SAIC and NSWC Crane Weapon Systems Division, JXN. But it doesn't stop there, Woods Hole has been given numerous indefinite delivery and definite quantity NSWC contracts to build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support unmanned undersea vehicles specifically for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center installations. Now we finally get to the most interesting part of this video, a deep sea USO recovery experience that ties together much of what we have discussed on today's episode. This story first appeared on Art Bell's Coast to Coast call-in episode on 19 April 2002, and I plan on using clips of the audio here, however, if people would be interested in fully released audio where I work with a 3D artist to recreate the encounter, please let me know. In this live radio call-in show, Art Bell was contacted by a retired Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel. The caller, first name Mark, had been assigned to 22 area camp Pendleton to work with the first air delivery unit before being stationed at Okinawa, Japan at the Fatima USMC Air Station. It was here he began doing rescue diving work on weekends alongside a Navy crew. Mark would form a friendship with the Lieutenant and the Navy who would go on to become a commander of a DSRV or Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle unit. The friendship I made later came back that I was assigned or requested to join this DSRV unit and did and was reassigned to Virginia. And basically what we did was a deep sea rescue and recovery. If we had a downed aircraft, we would go and try to rig the craft to get it back. Anything, any anomaly that we wanted to look at, basically we were sent, there were several teams that did the same thing we did. How deep did you go? We could go two miles, excess miles, you're pretty much pushing it. This particular incident I wanted to tell you about was out of my mind. You're saying you could go over 10,000 feet? Yes. Wow. All right, anyway, go ahead. Well, I'll say the particular incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile and a half of water north Atlantic. The specific mention of DSRV is critical to this entire investigation. The United States created two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that operated within the U.S. Navy from 1970 to 2008. Mystic, DSRV-1 and Avalon, DSRV-2 were products of the Lockheed Missile and Space Company in Sunnyvale, California. DSRVs are to this day some of the most technologically advanced submersibles in the entire world. These two vehicles were capable of deploying anywhere in the world transported within a truck, C-5 Galaxy, or naval vessel to piggyback efficient routes to rescue crews of stranded submarines within 72 hours. These highly advanced submersibles employed a guidance system more complex than Apollo 11's, allowing the DSRVs to hover in place in strong ocean currents to mate with disabled submarines. The Navy conducted numerous exercises with DSRVs-1 and 2, but no official rescues were ever conducted. And this is due to no American subs sinking since 1971, and 1972 saw the introduction of DSRVs-1 and 2. It is interesting to note, DSRV was born from 1964's Deep Submergence Systems Project, DSSP, to increase and develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities. The project was initially founded out of the Navy's special program Office, and DSRV's launch date of 70-71 dovetails closely with the beginning of Neuro in 1969. Interesting how the DSSP was also founded partly out of the loss of the USS Thresher, the same sub Woods Hole was attempting to find when it discovered the Titanic. If this story is true, this means DSRV, Mystic, and Avalon's practice missions were really to retrieve underwater aircraft and vehicles. And this is most likely fact, as Dr. John Pena Craven, chief scientist of the special program's Office of the Navy and first head of the DSSP, wrote regarding DSRV and classified operations quote, There were many highly classified missions associated with national security that cannot be accomplished without a DSRV system. The specific operational needs of these missions could not be anticipated, but they were certain to occur. Thus, a DSRV designed, constructed, and deployed for every conceivable rescue mission would also be available for the intelligence quote, unquote, mission impossible that were sure to occur, end quote. Craven's words here are particularly interesting. In 1964, Craven was tasked with spearheading the Deep Submergence Systems project, which led to the creation of the DSRV and other deep clandestine subs like the NR-1 to respond to unprecedented events at dramatically extended operational depths. In 1965, Craven was given a high-level intelligence briefing by a Naval intelligence officer and was informed on the existence of an extremely sensitive program named SandDollar. From Craven's book, The Silent War, the Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea, we get a rare chance to learn more about this program. SandDollar was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items with national security importance from the sea floor of the continental shelf in deep marine environment. According to the Silent War, SandDollar was buried within the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris sub-program. This hierarchy and compartmentalization of programs is something we have observed extensively in the Wilson Davis notes and throughout our investigation today. Craven even wrote the program is still classified to this day, that being 2002, quote, I was shown an inventory itemizing the items to be known on the seabed and a map of their distribution throughout the world, end quote. To expand on this statement, quote, the salvageable items of interest were spread around the globe. There were plenty of interesting objects on ocean floors worldwide, not just in the Bermuda Triangle, and there was an equal distribution of these objects between those that were lying on the continental shelf and those in deep oceans. There was a skew in favor of the continental shelf because of the shallow water, rocks, and shoals, but much of that hardware had either been salvaged or scattered by storms, Craven would even discuss two vessels previously mentioned to have been used in operational capacity by the Nuro, the Halibut and Seawolf. Craven claimed there was no need for maximum security for these submarines because they themselves, quote, they only transported top secret equipment and teams of industry specialists who would carry out unknown missions in unknown parts of the sea. The performers and the performances were invisible, end quote. As we explore this undersea recovery with DSRV units, we can now study the case with a strong thesis in mind. Chief scientist John Craven was tasked by the US Navy to drastically increase naval deep sea diving and engineering capabilities to retrieve undersea objects discovered by an astoundingly compartmented program called Sand Dollar. Craven's 1964 Deep Submergence Systems project would lead to the creation of clandestine submersibles that were capable of retrieving, quote, unquote, items of interest from the sea floor. Some of these submersibles, such as the DSRV units, would be shuttled via mother ships, including Nuro's Halibut and Seawolf. So now the question must be asked, was Sand Dollar the Navy's first UFO legacy program designated with the discovery, monitoring, and retrieval of UFOs? After all, Craven would state, quote, could I organize and manage a program to carry out this mission using the assets of the DSSP? Furthermore, could I carry it out in such a manner that my family and friends and closest professional colleagues would have no idea that I was involved in such a project? End quote. From the DSSP, the Navy planned to build six DSRV units and additional DSRVs known as Deep Submergence Search Vehicles, DSSVs, that were never officially built outside of Mystic and Avalon. These DSSV-DSRVs were intended for sea floor exploration and recovery, and to be capable of clandestine operations with an operational depth of 20,000 feet. So while we dive into Mark's story, I do think it is possible he and his Navy unit were assigned to a DSSV, not the two acknowledged Mystic and Avalon DSRVs. If this is the case, no such vessel in which Mark was operating was ever publicly acknowledged to have been built. But back to the story. Our story takes place in the early summer of 1991 at a depth of roughly 1.5 miles in the North Atlantic 250 nautical miles or roughly 288 standard miles outside of Aberdeen, Scotland. Looking at 250 nautical mile radius outside of Aberdeen compared with the Atlantic Ocean depths, we can draw a reasonable estimate of where this retrieval incident would have taken place. Let us also account for some error in Mark's estimate and give a generous plus or minus 20% room for error in radius here. Therefore, our radius could be up to 50 nautical miles larger, so we have a standard radius of 345 standard miles. And folks using the superior metric system here, I am sorry guys. Waters in the Atlantic near the UK are actually quite shallow, however. 345 miles almost due west of Aberdeen sees depths reaching over 8,000 feet, which is over our mile and a half claim. This area of ocean is known as the Rockall Trough, east of the Rockall Plateau. Hopefully further data can come from this very specific location at which this retrieval is alleged to have occurred. Mark's DSRV crew had been sent from Virginia, and as we know from a 2011 Nuclear Regulatory Commission emails detailing the tsunamis in Japan, both the east and west coast of the United States had employed a quote, very operational, ready deep-submergence rescue vehicle, end quote. On the DSRV, Mark served to operate computer equipment on the optical and electronic recognition side and also worked on mechanical aspects of the vessel with mechanical arms and rigging for object retrieval. Mark's team was dispatched after a survey vessel in the North Atlantic had picked up a radioactive signature on the seafloor. A second vessel equipped with a side scan determined a vessel to be resting on the seafloor. Naval authorities thought this to be a crashed foreign nuclear submarine. However, the radar signature had shown the object to be smaller than any known nuclear sub. Upon diving, Mark's DSRV attempted to contact the vessel and immediately realized this was not a sub, but shaped more like an aircraft. And what they did was send a vessel around with a side scan, picked up that there was a vessel on the bottom. They thought first possibly a submarine that had some kind of problem there, not ours obviously. Yes sir. We would have been in communication. The vessel came back, it was much too small, any sub that they were familiar with. And at that time we came on site. But you were getting some kind of nuclear signature from it? Right, there was a radiation from it. And the concern was, was it a weapon, some type of concealed weapon source or was it actually a power source? Right. And we were brought out from Virginia, steamed out. And not to give you specific minutes, seconds location, just approximately 250 miles out of Aberdeen, Scotland is where we were. You can draw a circle and narrate down pretty quick at that depth. You can limit the waters. Yes sir. But upon diving, we went down, like I said, just under a mile and a half. And we contacted the vessel, which we immediately recognized not as a submarine, but more of an aircraft. Communications back to the top, we were told to go observe, photograph, determine what we had. We thought at that point we had possibly a Russian or Korean aircraft with some type of contained weapon source. So as we went in. Yeah, that would be logical. We went in and this particular vessel was partially in the mud, submerged or buried under some mud, had been there for some period of time. And how much were you, what were you seeing of it? What shape? What we saw was the, I would say the rear two thirds. It was a triangular shape. It was waged more. Triangular. Triangular shape. And best likely to describe it, it would be nosed in with about two thirds exposed to the back. Yes sir. And as you come out the triangular shape at the back, it was rounded as it came to the corner. What would be the corner of the triangle? They were rounded on both sides. Oh my. Oh really? And this obviously not a conventional aircraft. Well one, one comment was made in the SRV. The little lieutenant commander is also a good friend was, my comment was, I don't believe it's Russian. And his comment was, if it is, it's not Russia right now, you know, joking. And what, you know, the best way I can describe it, it was a charcoal gray in color. It had some markings on the side. Sir, sir, listen, I'm coming to a break at the top of the hour. Can you manage to hold on? I can if you'd like, yes. I would like, yes. Stay right there, all right? You located this craft, which was a triangular in shape, and you were seeing the back portion of it. Right. At this point, we, we'd come over almost what you, I would best describe as broadside to, to the, the craft, the nose, what I would determine as the nose in was submerged in mud. Mark and his crew had no matching craft or pattern to cross reference this craft. The 60 to 70 foot charcoal gray triangle with smooth edges, no windows, rivets, seams, or bolts, a rounded rear, and hieroglyphic writing along the side did not lead the crew to suspect terrestrial origins. Mark and his Lieutenant Colonel friend both thought the craft to be extraterrestrial, but did not relay this to the surface out of fear of psych evaluations and to not risk communication interception. The surface LPH vessel ordered the DSRV unit to return with still photography and video of the craft. We do need to quickly address the markings on the side of the craft that Mark relayed. And there were markings on the side of it, which were in the, in the skin itself. And how would you describe those markings? You don't know, I've heard this before, people try to say hieroglyphics and all of this. It was not a, it was not any, any language or marking which we would typically see, Russian Arabic, nothing we were trained or had seen previously. But hieroglyphic light. Well, I'll say hieroglyphic light, but more geometric patterns. There weren't large walking individuals with bird heads and, and you know, when I think of hieroglyphics, I think of individuals with a head, like a bird or wolf and then human body just didn't have, have those type of patterns. It was more geometric shapes, but, but you could tell some of the actual characters repeated quite a bit of it was in mud. And then there'd be gaps throughout a mud that you could see some repeating of the character. I have covered in great detail the high confidence 1965 Kexpert, Pennsylvania, crashed retrieval in which numerous town residents observed US military forces retrieve and transport a 12 foot acorn like bronze craft. Many such witnesses described hieroglyphic style writing around the circumference of the lower lip of the craft. And additionally, Danny Sheehan has stated in the classified project Blue Book Files, he has seen images of a crashed UFO saucer that display geometric hieroglyphic style characters along its circumference. This is a fascinating detail and connection to these other cases. After 12 hours of waiting after returning to the surface, the DSRV crew was ordered to dive again, this time taking a marine archaeologist. The archaeologist made sketches of the craft and even traveled down with his own personal computer. Where did this go from there? I mean, now you've got this thing ID. Would you suddenly out of the picture or? Well, we're in the picture up, up to the point where we're rigging and recovering. As I said, we took down a marine archaeologist. And one thing that was very interesting that this individual, we actually monitored currents, did some things, temperatures and such at the site. He was making quite a bit of notes and, you know, really not, not making a lot of comment, but he did make the comment when we asked, you know, is this recent? Because there was no disturbed area around it, best way to describe it. It looked like it had been in place. And he said that it wasn't any more recent than at least 30 to 40 years, which really threw us back because this thing looked like something beyond, you know, where we're at development-wise aircraft. And I still had to rule out that it was not experimental aircraft at this point, someone's. But the point that he made that the buildup of the silt mud in the front end would appear that this has fallen in place for a period of 30 years or somewhere in the range 30 to 40 years. And you have, was there an attempt made at recovery? There was a recovery made, not an attempt made, there was a recovery made of the craft. What do you know about that? On the third day of the operation, the DSRV crew dove for a fourth time, this time to retrieve the craft. The team first used thrusters to remove silt and mud from the craft's midsection. So Mark and others could attach equipment to try and lift the vehicle. Immediate problems arose as this crashed USO did not fall under the same procedures and weight estimations used for conventional aircraft. Due to this, the DSRV crew had to make size and base weight estimations. The craft's weight estimations was based on the closest size conventional aircraft, the F-14. We had thrusted away a lot of the silt mud from the from the vehicle. Still had a section, probably about the eight foot that was trapped or under depth, it was more of an angle to it. So when we rigged it to bring it up rear first, use the best language I can, we were going to try to lift the rear end up and bring this thing up on an angle and try to keep everything intact and go. Yes sir. We're rigging that with our calculation for the rigging, the weight, brought it up and it went probably about two and a half to three times the ascent as what we anticipated, which immediately gave us the feel that we're dealing with something extremely light. Trailing the craft as it ascended, the DSRV crew noticed the underside of the craft was completely smooth. No piping, exhaust or mechanical features existed on the underbelly of the triangle. When the vehicle was recovered, Mark got a clear look at the craft. It proved to be six to eight feet longer than an F-14 at 62 feet, meaning this craft was 68 to 70 feet long. Mark stated nothing like that existed in 1991 and as of the show in 2002, still nothing like that existed. The craft was a solid metal form with no cockpit and no windows. Right, it was a little bit, actually a little bit longer than the aircraft would be, probably six to eight feet, I would say, in excess of what you would anticipate for F-14. Colonel straight out question is, do you believe that you recovered an alien craft? I've never, you know, I've had conversations with the individual, my friend that actually was there, we're still in contact quite often. I can't definitively say that it was. I can only say that it was an object that didn't belong there and certainly would not have belonged there 30 or 40 years prior to when we were on site and no visible means of, you know, if you anticipated it was an aircraft and I saw a cockpit, I would say it was definitely somebody's here that was in development but the technology would not allow you to fly to craft 30, 40 years ago. Within four hours, Mark and his entire crew were steamed off-site. Mark received no feedback or debriefing on what the vehicle was, nor did he and his crew receive any threats or warnings, not to speak about the incident. However, Mark did state when he joined the DSRV team, he was ordered to sign some pretty lengthy NDAs. As we know from Dr. Craven and DSRV for clandestine usage, this does not come as a shock. Mark would be subject to such intense secrecy regarding his work on the DSRV. Mark stated, even if the DSRV retrieved a US vehicle, they were not allowed to Art Bell got the original sketches of the retrieval by the naval lieutenant colonel and Mark told Bell he would connect him with the naval officer. I am still trying to chase down this case with the help of some high-profile naval officials. More investigation does need to be done on this case since officially DSRV's mystic and Avalon had an operational depth of just over one mile and it would be unusual to employ USMC divers for the time. For this reason, I do think back to the 1964 proposal of six DSRV and DSSV under the Deep Submergence Systems Project where only DSRVs one and two were built. Remember back to the words of Dr. John P. Craven, chief scientist of the Navy Special Projects Office who discussed many classified operations were performed by DSRV teams. I do think it possible DSRV units outside of Mystic and Avalon were built with capabilities akin to the DSSV units. 20,000 foot operational depth capacity with a greater capability for seafloor navigation and object retrieval. And it is interesting of course to point out the 1964 Deep Submergence Systems Project DSSP which aimed to increase and develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities for Project Sand Dollar which resulted in the creation of DSRV, occurred just two years after the October 1962 Blue Guild Triple Prime US Navy UFO recovery. Additionally, this case piqued my interest due to the presence of a crash triangle. So often in my videos I discuss many triangular sightings being alien reproduction vehicles. Whether this be the TR3B XF131 Supercentinal or a long list of prototypes I have wagered to be built in the late 70s into the early 2000s, I believe the US saw heavy clandestine experimentation within USAPs to build triangular shaped alien reproduction vehicles. But this triangular case harkens my attention back to the alleged Special Operations 1 Majestic 12 Manual. In this piece the SOM101 allegedly written in 1952 details are given to extraterrestrial craft types including triangles which according to the document were very new and very rare at the time. The DSRV retrieved the triangle allegedly in 1991. The marine archaeologists claim the triangle had been buried for 30 to 40 years meaning the crash likely occurred between 1951 and 1961. Interesting how this date range coincides with the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual claiming new triangular extraterrestrial vehicles were being spotted at the time of the 1954 Manual. If these retrieval events are true and the inside sources of Chris Sharp are correct, water-based USO and UFO recoveries are stationed at naval installations and locations of the Office of Naval Research where they are then utilized in material exploitation programs. Let us review some cases and testimony throughout history of downed craft stored at naval installations. We will reference numerous sources here including the legendary Leonard Stringfield whose work I referenced often in my dumb video. Stringfield's crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7 are in my opinion the best crash retrieval work done by any investigator. I will also omit stories of China Lake and the testimony of Randy Anderson and the Off-World Technologies Division as I have covered these stories and installations and experiences in depth in the past. Leonard Stringfield was once contacted by letter in 1978 tipping him off to Derward Buddy Hack, a CPO radar observer who in 1952 while stationed at the Naval Air Station Sunnyville, California disappeared out of sight. While serving at the Naval Installation Hack, according to his family, accidentally entered a large door of a hangar that was temporarily unguarded. There he encountered a massive saucer-shaped craft with rows of windows and when the guards returned they forced Hack out and threatened him. Stringfield contacted multiple members of Hack's family who confirmed hearing the story including his mother who not only confirmed Hack's disappearance but also the saucer story. Hack's mother would hear him say quote, it was certainly no aircraft of ours, end quote. In 1979, 6 February 1979 to be exact, Stringfield received a letter from one Joan Jeffers. Jeffers stated she knew a retired Ustaff Colonel who enlisted in the 40s and retired in the 70s. While stationed at an Air Force radar facility, the Colonel would attend weekly commander's calls at the Naval Air Station in New Brunswick, Maine. At one such meeting in 1956, the Colonel was shown a film by Major Lester Goldberg that was apparently shot by the Ustaff. Interesting side note here, one Major Lester Goldberg did in fact serve at the Brunswick Naval Air Station at this time and was the commanding officer of the 654 aircraft control and warning squadron. The film showed a circular metal silver colored disc on the ground. The interior of the craft was well lit and featured smooth walls. The film also showed at least three bodies lying on tables. The beans were short and they all looked similar in appearance featuring a sheen or gray color. None of the beans had any external ears or hair, all appeared to be dead. Further sources of Stringfield, like the anonymous Lieutenant Colonel X, would even state the Navy housed biologics. Such as in 1975, when Lieutenant Colonel X claimed quote, bodies are now being flown outside of the US to a secret naval installation on an island in the Pacific Ocean. End quote. Now the US Navy does employ multiple DOD laboratories and MRTFBs or major range and test facility bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These include the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center on the Andros Island Bahamas and Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. There is also incredible research I plan to explore in the future conducted by Dr. Richard Sotter that similar to deep underground military bases, the US Navy employs deep underwater military bases. And those familiar with my discussion of MRTFB will recall such installations as Dugway Proving Ground, Edwards 412 Test Wing, NAWC China Lake, Fort Hachuka, the Nevada Test and Training Range, and more. Lieutenant Colonel X also brought forward an interesting connection to the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual which claims deceased biologics were taken to the Wright Patterson Blue Room while living entities were taken to the OpNAC BBS 01. Some have guessed OpNAC is similar to OPNAV which is the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations while BBS is the Bermuda Biological Station, an Atlantic based installation now called BIOS. In Crash Retrieval Status Reports 3, Case 15b, Stringfield relayed a cat and mouse game with witness AF and his brother Pete. This story took place at the Naval Air Base Yuma, Arizona, now called the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, which is directly near Yuma Proving Ground. If you remember back to my video on Dumbs, the US Army Corps of Engineers took a tremendous interest in building underground installations beneath Yuma County, Arizona. This case in question really frustrated Stringfield, quote, what seemed to be a case of great potential, including the emergence of photographs of a saucer in military custody, became less so with the passing of time. Following a series of alleged interferences, my sources said they feared even greater consequences and backed off into oblivion, end quote. Stringfield reckoned this case to either be a ploy or example of the lengths legacy operations will go to silence and formance. Witness Pete, a former US Marine, claimed to have photographed a saucer-like craft at the Naval installation in Yuma, Arizona in 1967. Stringfield tried for months to meet Pete and his brother AF and organized to receive the photos by mail. AF even claimed to have sent numerous letters to Stringfield that were likely intercepted. Stringfield would speak to the men on the phone and learn Pete had been approached by some sort of agency to stay quiet. An intriguing case to mention but a massive dead end for both Leonard Stringfield and us. Our most fruitful case in Stringfield status reports can be found in UFO crash retrieval status reports 3 under case A7. This case takes us to the Great Lakes Naval Base in Northern Illinois in 1973. While we discuss this case, do keep in mind the Office of Naval Research has a major Chicago department less than 40 miles away from the Great Lakes Naval Station. Our encounter comes from one witness R.K., an E-4 grade instructor in Gunnery School at the Great Lakes Naval Base from March 1973 to September 1974, destined for intelligence school. I myself am aware of R.K.'s true name and am trying to vet this individual. On 14 July 1980, R.K. came to the House of Stringfield and relayed his encounter. In September 1973, while instructor in Gunnery School, R.K. was assigned to guard the premises of a large Quonset hut at Great Lakes Naval Base with orders not to let anybody within 100 yards. While on duty, R.K. was approached by a naval officer who handed him a sealed envelope to deliver to the commander in the Quonset hut. Entering the facility, R.K. observed a strange metallic craft 30 feet in length and 10 feet in height resting on a wooden platform. According to R.K., quote, it was light silvery blue and shimmering. It tapered like a teardrop with a flange running along its topside from one end to the other and there were no windows, end quote. R.K. could not linger in the hut due to the presence of other guards. Thus, he delivered the envelope and returned to his post. R.K.'s encounter bore striking resemblance to the testimony of a sailor he had met in San Diego just weeks prior whilst on special assignment. According to this sailor, a UFO identical to the one R.K. would observe in the coming weeks at the Great Lakes Naval Station was shot down by the Navy between Hawaii and the mainland in June of 1973. This UFO was picked up via destroyer's radar and came into view making three close passes and one direct overflight over the destroyer. According to the sailor, the UFO was shot with a lucky hit and crashed into a 350 foot deep water. The San Diego sailor claimed the object was retrieved by the Glomar Explorer and shipped to Hawaii and sent stateside and finally to Chicago. The sailor even provided R.K. a sketch that was identical to what he had seen. But just hold on a second here, the claims of the Glomar Explorer retrieving the craft are of significant consequence here. Glomar was run by Nuro, a joint naval in CIA-DSNT effort. If this story is true, this means the Navy, CIA, and intelligence organizations such as Nuro downed a UFO and retrieved it from sea. The craft was then shipped to an ONR location where due to being guarded on a wooden platform was likely destined for further transport and study. This incident mirrors perfectly the 2024 claims of Chris Sharpe's informants. Other cases of naval bases in the Office of Naval Research possessing both information of crashed disks and the materials themselves are plenty. In 1994, former New Mexico State rep J. Andrew Kissner stated sources within White Sands Proving Ground in the Naval Research Lab briefed him on recovered flying disks in 1947. These disks were given to the custody of the Atomic Energy Commission and studied by national laboratories such as Los Alamos, Sandia, Rand, MITRE, etc. This is very similar to my modern-day hypothesis of DOE working alongside FFRDC and to exploit UFO materials. According to Kissner's naval sources, the UFO programs were signed into Presidential Executive Order under Truman in 1948 with the National Security Council serving as program coordinator. With support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Research and Development Board ran by Dr. Vannevar Bush in the Naval Research Lab. Interesting to note as well, in 2005, USAF veteran Stephen Walker would claim while serving at the Naval Support Facility in Diego Garcia, he was exposed to the Navy conducting sensitive operations outside of a large hangar at the northern end of the airfield. Base personnel were ordered to stay away from this quote-unquote empty hangar. One night while the flight line was evacuated, the base was locked down and personnel were ordered to stay inside away from windows for the arrival of a classified aircraft. Walker claimed that despite listening for the craft for nearly half an hour, he heard no jet engine, no brakes, no tires hitting the pavement, no idling, or no Air Force sounds. This experience is very interesting when analyzing the claims of Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet, who claimed UFO programs were moved out of Area 51 in the early 90s because of intensive scrutiny from the public on Groom Lake. UFOs, especially the TR-3B Reverse Engineer Triangle programs, were relocated to various installations including Dugway Proving Ground and Diego Garcia. I must now circle back to early discussion of Neuro and reference back to U.S. Intelligence Committee and discussion of Imogen and SIGINT collection from submarines, a program at one time designated the Special Navy Control Program. Special Navy Control Program is quite similar to something called the Navy Special Program or NSP. The NSP is a highly elusive naval office that's similar to Neuro we can only find snippets of. The first ever mention I can find of the Navy Special Program is in a 1974 Omnibus National Security Council Intelligence Directive alongside the NRO. Remember, the NRO was not declassified until 1992, so this mention of the National Reconnaissance Program, which is the direct funding mechanism for the NRO, is likely to obfuscate the program. But what exactly is this Navy Special Program mentioned alongside the National Reconnaissance Program, especially in the context of this NSCID, not wanting to bring undue attention to both of these programs. Now since NRO was created between the Navy and CIA DSNT, you may think Navy Special Program refers to NRO. However, the Navy Special Program is itself a very real office. Indeed, the Navy Special Program office serves as an umbrella control system for several naval clandestine undersea operations. However, in this context and due to the extreme secrecy of NRO to this day as highlighted by Inman, NRO could have certainly been rolled under the NSP. To further this thesis, we can look back to an 11 December 1975 declassified memo for the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and others. Here we get a keen look at the organizational structure of the Navy Special Program. The Navy Special Program was once designated to run parallel to the National Reconnaissance Program or NRO under the Executive Committee for the Director of Central Intelligence and the Assistant Secretary for Defense for Intelligence. Someone really ought to ask Christopher Mellon about the Navy Special Program seen as he himself served as former ASD slash I. The NSP, according to this memorandum, serves to act for intelligence collection, similar to the NRO, DIA, or CIA. Having previously detailed the duties of NRO, I do think this description means NRO is likely hidden within the NSP here, especially given the timeframe 1975, where throughout our investigation we see NRO's activities really ramping up from its creation in 1969 throughout the 70s. Therefore, with the Navy Special Program acting as an umbrella office for numerous Navy clandestine operations, including possibly housing NRO, it is no stretch to theorize a program that conducts undersea retrievals of anomalous craft alongside NRO that sends such vehicles to the Office of Naval Research locations, to then be studied by federal elements and defense contractors would be hidden within the NSP. These operations would be compartmented and rolled under the Navy Special Program Office. This process for naval UFO legacy programs would likely remain the same today. After all, as of 26 May 2023, we can find requests for approval for special access program facilities by the Navy Special Program central office. Naval legacy programs hidden within the NSP for extensive classification and compartmentalization carry sound logic, especially when factoring in statements of former Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet. Admiral Gallaudet has spoken on congressional record that whilst he is aware of testimony of naval UFO legacy programs, he did not directly encounter them or was not briefed during his prestigious position within the Navy. We can find one intriguing acknowledged CIA program that likely utilized the Navy Special Program, Project Palladium and its director Samuel Jean Poteet. Poteet served at the NRO, CIA DS&amp;T, as well as served as the technical director of the Navy Special Program Office, where he provided naval reconnaissance systems expertise for the CIA Directorate of Science and Technology. Poteet was a senior central intelligence agency scientific intelligence officer, inventor, teacher, and association executive. He, quote, provided scientific expertise on space and naval reconnaissance systems in the Directorate of Science and Technology and served at the National Reconnaissance Office as technical director of the Navy Special Program's office and as the executive director of the Intelligence Research and Development Council, end quote. Under the CIA, Poteet spearheaded Project Palladium in the 1960s with heavy use of naval assets, ships, and submarines. The project employed a variety of clandestine submarines, radar reflectors, and jamming tactics to trick and gauge Soviet radar capabilities. Essentially, Palladium performed to fill Soviet radar systems with fake UAP signatures. Of course, our true interest here lies with Palladium's usage of clandestine subs and Poteet's connection to the Navy Special Program Office. According to excellent researcher Jeff Cruikshank, references to Project Palladium can be found in the Majestic 12 documents. The TERS memo, dated 28 June 1961, is a majestic document Ryan and Robert Wood have rated with a moderate to high authenticity. This memo allegedly sees JFK, right to the Director of Central Intelligence, Alan Doliz, in a national security memorandum with the subject, quote, review of MJ-12 intelligence operations as they relate to Cold War psychological warfare plans, end quote. It is intriguing to see Alan Doliz did indeed meet with JFK twice, 28 June 1961. Cruikshank argues the psychological warfare plans referenced in the TERS memo directly reference Operation Palladium. Although Palladium didn't get its iconic name until April 1962, when Dr. Albert Whelan took over as head of CIA, DS and T, the description of Palladium would appear again in further majestic documents. And this is supported in the Medium Confidence Operation Review, the MJ-12 project, allegedly written by Alan Doliz on 5 November 1961. This document describes how the CIA was mapping the Soviet air defense system by using airborne electronic countermeasure equipment and balloon decoys. Such a purpose was to provide a true picture of how Soviet air defenses perceived UFOs. The memo discussed future similar psychological warfare plans very similar to the TERS memo. Details of Project Palladium appearing in early MJ-12 documents dropped to Jamie Chandra in 1984 proved significant. Seen as according to an article by Jean Petit in Stories of Intelligence Research, only six people knew about Palladium in the 1960s. Since Palladium was not declassified until long after 1984, this implies whoever wrote the select majestic documents was well aware or a part of Project Palladium. As a matter of fact, the first time Palladium would be discussed was within a classified manner in a 1998 CIA journal written about by the aforementioned Jean Petit. Historically, the Navy special program saw heavy compartmentalization and incredibly strict need to know access. In this 29 October 1974 CIA memo titled Clearances Held by NSIC or National Security Council Intelligence Committee Working Group Members, discussion was held around National Security Council Working Group programs overlapping certain compartmented areas of the Navy special program. For read-on access, clearance requests were required for a redacted name and National Security Council member and CIA officer Richard Ober. This NSC memo was sent just a few days after the NRO memo from 1974 we discussed earlier. We can additionally analyze a fascinating 14 December 1984 memo written to US Navy Rear Admiral and Director of Naval Intelligence John Butts. The memo thanks John for his personal sacrifices in arranging meetings in spite of a tooth injury. The writer from within the staff of the director of the intelligence community additionally informed Butts they had received a letter from the secretary of the Navy John Layman concerning the Navy special program. Remembered Layman additionally served as director of NRO. This letter apparently took a month to get to the desk of the director of central intelligence. The writer additionally suggested John Butts include a representative from Everett Heinemann's department on the redacted special ad hoc requirements committee. Remember, Heinemann was labeled by Inman as the CIA DS&amp;T member knowledgeable on UFO legacy operations. The work here on the Navy special program is just the beginning for me and the ties to other subjects we have covered today is extremely interesting. After all, I have found and attempted to contact numerous former Navy special program personnel. These include a man who served for three years as a diver in the Navy special program with the mobile diving and salvage unit one. I have also contacted one Mr. P. R. who served for eight years as project lead for Navy special program office and SOCOM acquisition program office. How interesting this ties into the work of Chris Sharp regarding USO retrievals the Navy and SOCOM especially intriguing seen as sharp implicated Lockheed Martin dry submersible as participating in USO retrieval and since 2023 SOCOM has declared operational capability with Lockheed Martin dry submersible. And finally, I have contacted one Mr. WH who served for two years as an office of Naval intelligence chief information security officer for the Navy special program. And please understand, I am protecting the identity of these individuals as they very well may wish to speak on the NSP. Believe it or not, today we have only scratched the surface of naval UFO legacy programs. In the beginning of this project, I separated naval legacy programs into four distinct categories monitor, collect, store and exploit. Of course, monitor has been emitted from today's discussion as has majorly exploit has the Navy successfully created seafaring ARV a deep sea equivalent to the flux liner. This of course will be another topic for another day. Today, we've investigated the Navy special program office and Office of Naval Research conducting undersea UFO and USO crash retrievals alongside SOCOM private entity such as Lockheed Martin and Woods Hole and intelligence organizations such as the NRO, NRO and CIA DS&amp;T. We have also discussed myriad senior naval officials such as Sumner Shapiro, Bobby Ray Inman and Nat Kobitz who have all commented on the existence of crash retrieval and material exploitation programs. We have barely begun to dive in and discuss the FFRDC's Naval UARCs and DOD RDT&amp;E facilities that are highly likely involved with naval UFO legacy programs. Outside of mention of Lockheed, Woods Hole and SAIC, we have barely even discussed contractors in UFO legacy operations. Outside of sole source contracts, we have yet to really even dive into how legacy operations within the Navy are funded. I have spoken before on witness Ed who claimed the existence of a joint UFO reverse engineering program between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range. After his service at Edwards, Ed would proceed to work at the Pentagon for the Air Force's RDT&amp;E panel chain where he would claim in two separate years 34 and 40 billion dollars disappeared to non-authorized transfer of authority funds. Ed would additionally work as liaison between the Pentagon and various defense contractors as an F-35 program subject matter expert. As a test director for an electronics warfare group dealing with reverse engineered UFOs out of the Edwards 412th test group, I have theorized Ed's work on the F-35 also dealt with anomalous technologies. This is no stretch as the F-35 program has historically carried an incredibly bloated budget of two trillion dollars. Such bloated budgets with backdoor clandestine UFO programs may have also occurred in the Navy and we may get a keen look at such an instance. In 1985, the U.S. Navy faced a massive controversy for an incredibly bizarre occurrence. Scandal arose when in 85 it was discovered the U.S. Navy had paid Grumman Aerospace Corporation $660 apiece for ashtrays to be included in the E2C Hawkeye. The Navy only began to investigate how many of these ashtrays had been bought and why they cost so much when an investigator for the House Government Operations Committee discovered this egregious oversight. From this investigation, it had also been determined the Navy was paying Grumman $400 per socket wrench that were used to adjust the seats of F-14s and the Navy had also increased payments for ground locks from $102 in 1982 to $2,710 a year later. Shockingly, this investigation would also reveal years prior the Navy had been charging itself $954 for ashtrays. For such infractions, Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, who made some contested statements about Neuroabove, removed three officers prior to any investigation, and Grumman aircraft wind that peace prices were so high due to needing to make a small number of parts to spec. The damage had been done, leading to House Committee investigators looking into larger naval contracts and discovered, for example, profits on aircraft carrier contracts were in excess of $753 million or 29.7% and contractor profits on a single Trident 735 submarine were in excess of $96 million or 22%. Where was all this excess money on contracts and parts going? I wager since we are discussing contractors such as Grumman, which I have directly implicated in UFO legacy programs before its merger with Northrop. These funds were siphoned off legitimate contracts or parts to fund clandestine deep-sixed UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs. So after all of this, today has mostly served as an expose into naval legacy crash retrieval operations and necessary logistics. More and more in my videos, I plan to speak on naval and special USO legacy programs. This is due to multiple sources of mine informing me Navy USO programs are more secretive than even standard UFO legacy operations. Hey guys, it's Gerb and thank you so very much for sticking through with me while we took this dive into the US Navy and UFO and USO legacy program operations. Now as I said at the very end of this video from multiple individuals that have worked in legacy programs to our tangentially aware of them have informed me that the US Navy's programs are the most secretive there are. Why is this? Is it because the Navy deals with weapons technology as in the Randy Anderson case with the gauntlet and the orb that supposedly experienced energetic discharge during recovery? Or is it because the Navy specifically the ONR is a pristine stop for craft? Or is it because the transmedium capabilities of UFO are the most coveted aspect of material exploitation and monitoring? Or is it possibly because some of the secrecy stems from the possibility there are undersea UFO bases and inherently if this is where some craft are stationed and departing from this implies much secrecy? And that sort of makes a little sense as we've seen with Nuro underwater reconnaissance underwater reconnaissance systems clandestine submarines are some of the United States most highly regarded secrets. We have five major intelligence agencies the CIA, DIA, NSA, one of my missing NRO and NGA and but Nuro is not on there and we've seen and proven today that Nuro does exist. So why is Nuro not listed? Nuro is really what kicked off my investigation into this subject back in September with the work of Chris Sharp. When he detailed and changed the article about undersea retrievals in the ONR, JSOC, SOCOM, Lockheed Martin Woods Hole and Nuro, this really kicked off my interest. One of the most intriguing aspects of this project of course was Bobby Ray Inman, a regular of this channel admitting that he was director of Nuro. And I'm really glad we got to explore a little bit more into Inman and his interactions with Eschler and Bobby and sorry, excuse me, Everett or R. Evan Heineman as well as Sumner Shapiro. Again, as I stated, I've received no contact back from Heineman and I've also tried to contact Shapiro's family. They have not gotten back to me either. I would like to get statements from some other people surrounding this case, but Nuro really kicked off this operation. And as we've seen with Nuro, as a black program agency, all of its operations have been shrouded in secrecy. Whether this entails usage of the Glomar Explorer, the Halibut, the NR Run, NR One, the Seawolf, there is so much secrecy surrounding Nuro and that bridges really perfectly into the 1991 retrieval case under witness mark. Now, as I said in the video too, I'm still vetting this case. I'm working with some individuals to try to identify mark to try to identify the naval lieutenant commander and trying to track down those original sketches. I know Art Bell has passed away and he was the point of contact for both of these. But I am trying to track that down. So mark story involves a DSRV or as I hypothesized from Craven and the work under the DSSP, a DSSV, Deep Submergence Search Vehicle. I think those depth capabilities and mechanical arms and rigging for retrieval of craft suit a DSSV more than a DSRV because DSRV was specifically created for transfer of crew from a submarine where a DSSV was specifically tailored, never built, to retrieve vehicles and to retrieve items. I did this fall under Project Sand Dollar. As we saw with Project Sand Dollar under Craven as well, Sand Dollar involved items of interest on the sea floor of particular interest were radioactive or nuclear emitting items. And as we see in Mark's case, the original side scan from vessels and other vessels that picked up the signature of the craft, this was emitting some sort of radiation to the point where the DSRV crew initially thought this to be a downed Korean or Russian aircraft with some sort of nuclear technology. And it is interesting to see as Mark said he steamed out of Virginia that the 2011 Fukushima documents detail that DSRV units were ready and able in the east and west coast of the United States. So let's talk about that incident a bit more because it's very rare we can ever find an undersea retrieval. The only other example I can think of is Shag Harbor which occurred in 1967 and I would like to tackle that case in the future, especially because there is testimony of the US Navy kind of coming in the US Navy divers and coming in and really taking over the retrieval operation. But Mark's DSRV crew observes a triangle. And as I said in the video, and as we talk about in this channel quite often, I oftentimes attribute human origin to triangular craft, whether this be the TR-3B, the XF-131 Super Sentinel, which I almost put more credence in than the TR-3B or other prototypes that we discussed throughout the 80s and 90s in the TR-3B video. But this craft featured hieroglyphic like writing alongside its outer edge, which, similar to Kecksburg and Danny Sheehan's accounts, is not rare but not common in UFO crash retrieval incidents. The description of this craft is very similar to other NHI craft, no landing gear, no mechanical systems, no cockpit, no glass, no windows, etc. What interests me is the aftermath of the retrieval. Mark states that after the marine archaeologist and four dives were able to observe the craft and they were able to get it off the ground and retrieve it, that after a couple hours Mark and his crew were steamed off site and were never warned not to speak about this incident, warned not to talk about it or sign further NDAs. Now Mark inherently had to sign NDAs and non-disclosure agreements for his work on DSRV, which as we know from John Pena Craven were sent almost exclusively on clandestine operations, so it stands to reason there's a heavy amount of secrecy when you sign on for this crew. But it almost appears as if the steamer of the LPH vessel that discovered the craft in the DSRV was still trying to figure out what the heck they had uncovered because it took a couple hours for Mark and his crew to be steamed off site and they were never briefed on the incident, debriefed or discussed it further. I do hope Mark is still alive and I would like to speak to him, I very much would. And then what is interesting with Nuro as well as the connection to the 1973 Great Lakes Naval Station case, of course Stringfield published on this back in the 80s, so the Glomar Explorer and its work with Nuro wasn't very well known, if at all at this time, the Glomar Explorer had been known for Project Azorian retrieving one third of the Soviet K-129 submarine, but just the connection of witness JK stating that the San Diego sailor that he met that saw basically the same craft he saw had told him that it had been shot down between Hawaii and the mainland by a destroyer and retrieved by the Glomar Explorer, and this was early 1973. And then there's fascinating connections that Bobby Ray Inman stated that in the early 70s, 72 to 74 to be exact, he became aware of the Glomar's activities out in Hawaii. So there's a lot of really connective tissue here with these statements and I know I say this in most videos, but our work with the Navy is really just beginning here. There are so many more facilities we need to look at, so much more investigation into China Lake, because the Navy and if Chris Sharpe's reporting is correct, the O&amp;R specifically is almost a staging point for housing craft. Now this makes me wonder, is this, does the Air Force, if they retrieve a craft or the Army, if they retrieve a craft, do they initially stage at naval locations to then be transported again? Does the Navy just satisfy naval UFO legacy programs for storage of craft, or do they also operate alongside Army and Air Force? This would surprise me, as everything I have been told, investigated and seen, is that Army, Air Force, and Navy almost act siloed, very different programs, sometimes doing the same thing, but almost no communication to adhere to the compartmentalization of these programs, where only the intelligence community overlords really know what's going on between programs. So that would be really interesting to track down. But anyways guys, if anybody watching this video has any experiences or connections with individuals who have retrieved undersea craft or know of stories of undersea craft retrieval, please contact me and I would love to speak to you. But let me know what you guys think in the comments. This was a wonderful project for me to pursue, and I really hope everybody enjoyed it. Let me know what you think, if you have any thoughts, comments, things to add, please remember to like and subscribe. I have a Patreon, I don't gatekeep content, that's not what I do.

Today I wanted to talk about the most famous UFO case in Spain, the Manisei incident, because what if I told you about a UFO sighting a pilot couldn't ignore? In fact this sighting was so prominent it led to the first ever commercial flight being grounded due to UFOs. Guys it is UAPGurb I am back to analyze some more of the most interesting UFO cases and encounters throughout history. Today the 1979 Manisei incident where the sighting of UFOs caused a commercial flight to be grounded and fighter jets to be scrambled. Now I'm going to use some of the original audio of this sighting from the actual pilots in this incident, but upon my search I found a channel called MPC Flight Recreations who actually incorporated the original audio with an edit of what this flight and encounter may have looked like. So I'm going to use some of his clips and I'm going to include his video link down in the video description. Highly recommend checking that video in his channel out because it's pretty cool. On November 11th 1979 pilot Javier Laredo de Tejeda was forced to make an emergency landing of his TAE Super Caravell and 109 passengers at the Manisei airport in Valencia Spain. This emergency landing was not due to mechanical failures or rowdy passengers but because of the pilots fear of colliding with a pair of strange red lights in the sky. Javier's flight departed the island of Malorca after a refueling stop for the craft's voyage from Salzburg Austria to La Palmas near 2247 hours. It's worth mentioning the other men in the cockpit of this Super Caravell, co-pilot Jose Ram\u00f3n, Zouaza Nagore and flight mechanic Francisco Javier Rodriguez. At roughly 2305 hours over the Mediterranean the flight mechanic warned the crew of two visible powerful red lights to the front left of the airplane at an altitude of near 23,000 feet. The crew radioed to air traffic control in Barcelona to determine the source of the lights but were told there were no other aircraft on or near Captain Javier's flight path. The pair of red lights appear to draw closer to the aircraft. The men were able to discern the strange lights as two powerful sources of light with no visible solid body. When changing altitude to avoid any sort of collision with the lights the pair mirrored the craft's new trajectory and stayed less than half a mile to five miles away from the plane. If you have a new seat, can you tell me if the lights are on the sea or on the air? The craft's new traffic is close to normal for now. It's not moving at all now, it's 5-0, the traffic is going to be between 2-3-1-6. The vectoring of the lights towards the aircraft alongside the fact no other aircraft were operating in the area, Captain Javier aborted the flight and made an emergency landing at the Manisace Airport in Valencia. He rationalized flying near the UFO completely violating all aerial safety rules alongside the inability to make an evasive maneuver in the event of a collision was not worth the risk of his crew and 109 passengers. Just prior to the emergency landing, the crew detected three new UFO signals on radar, each with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. It's worth noting these lights were witnessed by Manisace Airport personnel as well as military personnel specifically Marines on the nearby Manisace Air Force Base. Due to one of these signatures passing close to the airport runways, emergency lights were lit by land crew if by some slim possibility, the UFO was actually an errant aircraft experiencing technical difficulties. Due to multiple sightings of these anomalous lights, Captain Fernando Camaro was soon dispatched from the nearby Lozianos Air Base in a Mirage F1 to identify the mysterious UFOs at 040 hours. Here, the pilot experienced equally or even more extraordinary events than that of crew TAE JK 297. Camaro was forced to increase his speed to 1.4 Mach or 1,074 miles per hour just to make visual contact with an object he perceived as a truncated cone shape displaying a bright, changing color. Despite his efforts to approach the object, it quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was then informed of a new radar echo indicating another object may be near Segunto. The pilot took multiple pursuit vectors to approach the second object including traveling over the Mediterranean and the nearby Spanish inland territories just to have the object quickly dart away as he approached. Eventually, as Camaro neared the UFO, it seemingly responded, acknowledging his fighter jet. It was at this time the pilot had his avionics scrambled. The Mirage F1's electronic flight systems were jammed and the onboard alert system warned Camaro he was actively locked on by a continuous wave missile radar. The UFO then rapidly accelerated away towards mainland Africa. After nearly an hour and a half of pursuit and dangerously low on fuel, the pilot returned to base. This sighting took Spain by storm, reaching its parliament in September of 1980. After some representatives asked for an official explanation, it's unfortunate that the sighting was dismissed as a series of freak optical illusions. Okay, so let's review the facts of our case. TAE flight JK297 observed a set of red lights approaching their aircraft. After changing their altitude from 23,000 feet to avoid any collisions with the craft, the object matched the aircraft's trajectory and maintained a distance of 0.5 to 5 miles. Due to safety concerns of the crew, the flight decides to perform an emergency landing. Shortly before the emergency landing, two more UFOs appear with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. One object flies close to the nearby airstrip so on-ground employees turn on emergency lighting in case a rogue aircraft is in trouble. Multiple marine air-based personnel witness strange moving lights in the sky. A Mirage F1 is dispatched to investigate and must travel 1.4 Mach to even approach near the object. The pilot observes a conical shape before it rapidly accelerates out of sight. The pilot is ordered to pursue a second signature which, when close, actively scrambles his avionics equipment and onboard sensors. Please note that Kamara also states the object jammed his attempts to lock onto it with an IR missile. Now what stands out to me most about this case is not the crew aborting its flight path due to UFOs, but actually the sensory equipment failure of the Mirage F1. Believe me, this jamming has occurred multiple times in public UFO military cases. Everyone knows the story of Commander David Fravers' tic-tac sighting in 04 off the coast of San Diego. Did you know he says that the object's plural actively jam the radar and sensory equipment of the jets? And even more interesting, let's take a look at the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. This famous encounter details the experience of Major Parviz Jafari of the Imperial Iranian Air Force. In 1976 he was one of two jets dispatched to intercept a UFO that had been detected hovering over Tehran in his F4 Phantom 2 jet. The first of the two pilots lost all instruments and communication abilities when approaching the object so he was forced to turn back. Ten minutes later, Jafari was scrambled to intercept the UFO. While traveling at Mach 1, the Major observed the object 70 miles out, instantaneously jumped 10 degrees to his right. At this distance, the craft performed an instantaneous 26-mile jump in under a second. While approaching the seemingly diamond-shaped UFO, a smaller, spherical object separated from it and approached the F4 Phantom 2. Jafari's only instinct was to engage the smaller object with his weaponry, but when attempting to target the object, all of its instruments on board, including targeting and radio, went haywire. Frightening Jafari tremendously, he made the decision to emergency exit if the object approached within two miles of him. The pilot then performed evasive maneuvers to fly away from the object, where his instrumentation returned to normal and he regained contact with aerial command. This Tehran incident is one of my favorite encounters, and soon I'd like to make a video on global Air Force UFO encounters, but I just wanted to throw that in as another instance in which a military fighter jet experienced total instrument failure when engaging a UFO. Like with any credible sighting, with multiple eyewitnesses and multi-sensory data, we need to visit the Midwest-level debunk panel. So for this specific case, apparently the lights the Super Caravelle saw in 1979 were the lights of the combustion towers of the Escobrera refinery near Cartagena. This stationary lights do not account for the fact the trained pilots said that the lights approached their aircraft and maintained altitude while they performed evasive maneuvers and maintained a close distance the aircraft of 0.5 to 5 miles. Apparently these lights sent the captain into an anxiety attack, forcing him to land the plane and as well as the co-pilot and flight mechanic, they did not seem to argue with this rationale and they must have been inflicted with anxiety attacks as well. The moving lights that were seen by multiple menace airport personnel and nearby Marines, as well as the UFO that was seen near the airstrip, thus the emergency lighting was turned on in case there was a rogue aircraft, is apparently stars, planets, the same thing with every case. Everything just boils down to trained pilots and trained observers or people on the ground misconstruing Venus or Jupiter as a UFO, even though these lights are flashing multi-colored move or are a craft that are identifiable. The Mirage F1 explanation is both the most comical and most reasonable at the same time. At this time in 1979, the Iranian hostage crisis was being resolved and stationed near the Mediterranean was the US 6th Fleet. The scrambling of the instrumentation is said due to powerful electronic scrambling signatures on board to LHP to Iwo Jima helicopter carriers. However, pilot Fernando Kamara rejects this explanation stating that he was both too far away from this fleet to interfere with his flight navigation, radio, emergency control, so forth. And this doesn't account for the truncated cone shape that he witnessed with his own eyes as well as a craft that would speed away from him as he would approach it going 1.4 Mach. Furthermore, this explanation of the 6th Fleet does not explain the instance on which he tried to lock onto the UFO with an IR missile, where his systems were actively jammed. So to summarize that debunk panel, we have a confusion of stars. We have a refinery tower that a trained pilot gets an anxiety attack and must land his plane. And we have a pilot who is seen in a mirage with his own eyes and his jet. And it's just a US fleet. That's who knows how nearby. So to me at least that debunk panel doesn't hold up. I think that's a lot of coincidences at once that just does not stand up to me. I think this case is incredibly interesting and I think it is one of the world's most interesting cases. And it is, no matter how you look at it, true or false, the first recorded story of a commercial airliner being grounded due to a sighting of a UFO. But what do you think on this case? Have you heard about this case? Because it flies kind of under the radar to me, but it is Spain's most famous UFO case. If you've heard of it, let me know when did you hear about it? What do you think about it? If you haven't, what do you think about it? Think it's real? Or do you think it's fake? Or do you think it's an anxiety attack by a pilot and multiple eyewitnesses being confused? And I guess the similarities between that and the 1976 Tehran incident with the Mirage jet are just bad a coincidence. But I'll be fully transparent. I think this case is legitimate. Thank you guys and I hope you enjoyed this short documentary, another one. I know we're supposed to be on our iceberg part three and that will become and I just have been struck with some inspiration lately to make some of these documentary cases. I think they're fascinating. I have a ton more. I want to make a sort of global Air Force UFO encounter video pretty soon. I have some interesting cases from the U.S. Peru as well and all over the world. So stay tuned. Let me know in the comments what kind of video you want to see next.

Or maybe you think of the U.S. Air Force's foreign technology division initially achieved by Colonel Philip J. Corso, who stated technology such as night vision and fiber optics were reverse engineered for the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. Whatever you think of when you hear of the Off-World Technologies Division, there is a first-hand witness who can shed light on this never-before-heard-of, non-human-intelligence technology exploitation program. A witness whose claims can be backed by his U.S. Army Green Beret and Special Forces credentials and verified placement where he claims this anomalous division is stored. It was within this division stored at the Naval Surface Weapon Center in Crane, Indiana. Green Beret witness R.A. observed recovered technology not made by human hands. Technology so profound, strange, and advanced, it seemed the Navy and a certain private company's best and brightest could not begin to comprehend this tech. What's going on guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so much for joining me today as we hear from for the first time ever, the first-hand witness testimony of Special Forces member R.A. in his claims of an Off-World Technologies Division at the NSWC Crane. R.A.'s testimony may reveal a disturbing and monumental UFO reverse engineering program nestled within the Navy's premier special weaponry installation. Join me as we conduct an astounding primary investigation into R.A. his claims and a private defense contractor likely involved with UFO technology reverse engineering programs. To start, who exactly is R.A. and why should his testimony be heard? R.A. is easily the most accomplished and credentialed U.S. soldier I have ever had the pleasure of speaking to. R.A. is a U.S. Army Special Forces operator, aka a Green Beret, who served within the first Special Forces Airborne Command. He served as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant, a key element to any Special Forces division described by the U.S. Army as one of the most highly skilled soldiers in the world. 18 Bravos are tasked with operating and maintaining an array of weaponry, including small arms, heavy weapons, bombs, and mines, communications equipment, and must be able to employ conventional and unconventional warfare tactics, and guys this is key. Operate and maintain both allied and foreign weaponry. His Special Forces accolades have been thoroughly vetted, with R.A. providing a full list of his certifications as well as his DD 214. He also completed SEAR, Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape High-Risk Training at Level C, which is the hardest and most challenging SEAR course. The witness even completed the U.S. Army's ALC, or Advanced Learning Course, and earned a T.S.S.C.I. Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information Security Clearance. I was connected to R.A. through mutual contacts, who told me that this R.A. wanted to help disclosure, wanted to tell about his experience, but wanted to remain anonymous. Between 2013 and 2015, R.A. was sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, located in Crane, Indiana, to train with advanced foreign and domestic weapon technologies, and their implementation into the armed forces. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC, as I'll be referring it to for the rest of this video, is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane, alongside the U.S. Army Ammunition Activity, which stockpiles much of the U.S. mainland's munitions. Crane, Indiana was chosen for these stockpile duties during World War II, as such a landlocked state location would be difficult to be targeted by enemy forces. Quote, NSA Crane, home to one of the nation's most important military laboratories, is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best-kept secret, end quote, Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana. NSWC is an enormous facility, with several underground layers highlighted as the premier Navy lab, whose mission is to, quote, provide acquisition and in-service engineering and technical support for sensors, electronics, electronic warfare, and special warfare weapons, end quote. Operations at Crane are divided into three distinct focus areas, strategic missions, electronic warfare, and expeditionary warfare. But this location doesn't focus just on conventional missions, such as we see in this recent Duke University research funding announcement titled Long Range Broad Agency announcement for NSWC Crane. A key focus of Crane programs are advanced concepts and technologies. NSWC Crane is best described as a Navy federal laboratory with a reputation for national technical leadership, and a Navy lab that works directly with warfighters to create comprehensive, innovative solutions at the speed of relevance. The underground presence of this base is also key to mention here moving forward. Not only are there numerous underground bunkers for munitions storage hidden below the ground, but also small arms testing resources such as an underground 100-meter firing range. The naval support activity location holds over 3,000 buildings spanning 64,000 acres above ground. NSWC Crane is deeply tied to private defense contractors, employing over 2,489 private contract workers, including one in specific, we will mention in a little bit. As mentioned before, RA was at Crane to test advanced foreign and domestic weaponry. The Crane facility has historically worked closely with the U.S. Army for weapons testing, training, and defensive capabilities, such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq. And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering, quote, critical technology to maintain fleet readiness, end quote, such as this black box that was, quote, unknown how it was constructed, functioned, or how to repair it, end quote. This device was successfully reverse engineered by electromagnetic warfare experts and designated as critical technology in an AN-SLQ-32 or SLIC-32 component, a ship-board electronic warfare suite. Also interesting and worthy of note, NSWC has to adhere to DOD guidebooks for, quote, situations such as this, end quote. So let's hear from RA for the first time. In his words, why was he at Crane? It was for a weapons course. So we were, we were specifically going there to train up on the new Maygun setup and a couple other, like, SOCOM weapons that were coming in, coming online, like iterations to the SCAR, so some cases that were coming in, and then also to get educated on some of the enemy technology. So whenever we'd be training like that, that's like TSSCI level stuff. They'll have stuff that's, for example, they'll have a description of the course and what you're going to do, and then all the stuff that's going to, that you're going to get taught that's not able to be written down or, you know, exposed. It'll be, they'll explain that in a different way. So I would say that. It's like, we knew we were going to get exposed to some other foreign weapons that they had, they had recently recovered, and we were supposed to kind of just help provide an input on what we thought about those systems. And they did have them there. They had some Russian weapons that had bullets that they were, they think they could, Russian force firing with biologics and bullets. And so we had, we were doing some stuff with that. And so it was, it was looking at other foreign weapon systems that they were, they were spinning around with, and the CIA operatives had captured and that they go back to Crain. So if you think about it, like whatever mechanism they have, logistically, to get that shit from wherever they found it to Crain, why would they not use that same apparatus to get whatever else they find? RA was told that out of his class of about 10, him and only one other soldier with TSSCI clearance would be taken to see the interesting stuff, the quote, foreign adversarial tech. Yes. So the way that it was kind of weird how that happened, there was only, so there was a bunch of us in the class, I forget, I mean, you saw a picture, there was only two of us in that group that had a TSSCI level clearance at the time. And those were the two, we were the two that got taken to see the other stuff. So they were, the rest of the class didn't see the foreign weapons they were back in engineering or the awful technology that they had exposed us to. So nobody else saw that. And then we were also told not to mention next to the rest of the class that we were the ones getting exposed to that technology. So after observing tech considered disruptive, such as the experimental Russian bullets RA spoke of, him and his fellow soldier were taken deep underground to a location that stood out from the rest of Crain, appearing pristine and quite advanced. We went down into like an R&amp;D area, that's where it had on-vrooms. So the on-vroom is going to be like an extra layer of security, right? And then, so it's kind of what it was, we went through a couple checkpoints. I mean, I remember going through like a door to get to a door to get to that, like that kind of like compartmentalized, like whether who knows what they were scanning, I don't know, they're probably checking us for whatever. Obviously, it was like considered like a scare. So we give up all electronics and everything before we even went down there. So I mean, you're scrubbed, you know, everything possibly, you don't have anything that could take a note with or something, you know, you're scrubbed with everything. So then you go through, we went down the elevator, and like I said, it was, I could tell you're a lower pretty low, because I remember it being like one outside and then down there it was really cold, just because of the depths. So we had to be some significant amount below the surface, I don't know how far at all, but um, and then I went through the checkpoints and then into an arms room area, which is what we're shocking about again, is that all of crane was old and dilapidated and beat up. I mean, it looks like in 1970s facility, and you go underground in this area, and it was like a spaceship, you know, not literally, but I mean, it was so much more advanced than the stuff up top. Like you can tell this is where the, the shit happened. You know, this is where they maintained and upgraded and continued to work and all the other stuff that just kind of like let look like shit on purpose problem. Nothing in crane was labeled. All the buildings were, I mean, like really basic looking. When we were under, in that particular area, there was, there was labeling on like different areas. So there was like, I remember seeing a couple signs, I don't know what they said, I mean, so long ago now, but um, yeah, there was like signage like saying what part you were in. And what struck me is why I remember that, I think, is because like, I was thinking how big is this underground area that they have to label where you're at, you know, because if you think about it, I mean, if we just took an elevator down to the area that was small, then why would you label it? Oh, this is where you are here. And it felt like it was falling, not like it was this one little area, you know, it was under the NSWC crane, RA would arrive to observe the off world technologies division. RA was told by his guide, a private contractor, former military and the same individual leading the weapons training, quite nonchalantly that they were entering the quote, off world technologies division end quote. And before he expands on an I asked RA his initial reaction when he was told quite casually about the division's name. Well, I mean, I was a trained green beret, so my reaction was stoic, but when I got back to the hotel, I was freaking out. I mean, because up to that point, I had, I had believed in like, obviously that there were, you know, probably aliens out there, probably life out there in the universe, of course, just statistically speaking, but I never thought that I wouldn't have gone as far as if they'd been here or any of that. But to then to see that these guys were talking about like, was like, over a coffee break. I was really surprised by that. And me and the other guy had a great conversation about it when we got back. And it was kind of just like, now what? Because like the whole world is different to me. And it took me a lot of years. I thought about that for a lot of years, just was this mean for me, you know? Yeah, I mean, there's a part of me that was grateful that I got that I know, but that I know I can at least within myself, I can say, I know that there's another life out there, you know, and I know it because I was exposed to it in this way. However, that happened. Now I know, you know, and that's, I'm grateful for that. But at the same time, I don't know what the cost of that's going to end up being, you know, upon entering this unlabeled division, RA did not enter a normal firing range or laboratory. He and the other men were greeted to what seemed like a scientific observation room overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology. So it was, it was basically the way I would describe it is like a viewing room. And I think it was, you can imagine, like they're probably we're going to do different types of experiments on these objects and, and the area that they kept it in or stored it in, you know, or maybe they will just have this setup to be a piece to come through and look at it, people that weren't there, we're going to the people that know about this technology. I don't know. But it's clearly set up in a way that you could see the room that it was displayed in a way that was looked like it was displayed. I don't know. It was very, it's very possible that they were, it was both on that stuff and somebody would have drove them from the area we were in. solely RA, the other green beret, the guide and one staff member were present. The contractor present was quote, pretty normally dressed and quote, appearing similar to a normal lab technician. One of these devices displayed was a sphere no bigger than a basketball and seemingly constructed from seamless metal. Yeah, I don't know. So hard to describe. It just, it looked unnatural. The, the sphere itself was on like a podium type of thing. And it, from what I could see, it didn't look like it was connected to the podium. It looked like it was almost repelled off the podium. It was a very, it was a awkwardly, like almost looked liquid, but it was clearly metallic, seamless. It just didn't look natural, man. Like if you, if you took a chrome ball the same size, chrome sphere, polish it up and put it in that room, it would look different than that. But I can't tell you how, because I don't have anything to reference to that. It just didn't look right. It didn't look, it looked different than anything I've ever seen. If you brought that ball in a room to me right now, I was like, this is from another world. Nobody would doubt that. Everybody in the room would probably be like, yeah, that's something weird about that, you know? I wondered if this sphere's surface description was similar to the mother of pearl effect Lance Corporal Jonathan Weighant claimed to have observed from the crashed UAP in Peru in 1997. RA described this sphere as extremely clear, and the mother of pearl effect could be accurate if we utilize an oil on water analogy, but with the oil being clear. RA claimed the sphere had an indent on top that almost looked like where one would put a hand, but did not get a crystal clear look at this. About the size of the hand, I wouldn't say there was forehand, because that would be, I mean, that's my human interpretation of what I would think it would do, you know? RA's guide told him and the other Green Beret this object and the other piece of technology somehow interacted with human consciousness. Both the audience they had under there, they said somehow interacted with consciousness in it, and the way he said it, and it was why it gets so fuzzy. He said, I wouldn't quote these things, because I'm kind of trying to just remember the context, and I can, again, like when I meditate, I think about this, I can usually get more back, but just like sitting here talking and remembering it, it's difficult sometimes. But I remember him saying, we don't understand quite how to operate the systems or how they, but they do interact with consciousness. So certain, and some people they interact with, and some people they don't. So certain people will go up to the object and it will respond, and some people go up to the object and it does nothing. So certain types, I don't know if that's related to DNA or to consciousness or whatever, but it's different people will have a different response, and they, they has kind of walked closer to the window, and nothing happened. So we didn't, I mean, I don't know if we got closer to something would have happened, but I don't know if they were even looking for that. But maybe, you know, that's one thing he said that like certain people will go near the object and it will react. He didn't describe how it would react, he said it would react. RA states, once he began to view the pieces of technology, his recollection of these events becomes somewhat fuzzy. There's a really weird component to this, and I don't know what this means. But when I think back to this particular memory, and this never happens to me in any other thing, I get real fuzzy. It gets real fuzzy, like almost like something was purposely done to make it that way. Because I have a very photographic memory and things I've done in the military, like I can tell you the color, the buttons on a shirt of a guy, I snipe from, you know, 800 meters away. So, I mean, for me to not remember this is really bothers me, but there's some cloudiness when I try to access this part of my brain, you know. Maybe it could definitely be the objects themselves that have been. It felt, this is why it's a good quote, because obviously, it felt weird being down there, okay? There's something like, there was just, it's an unnatural feeling. It felt like we were doing something that wasn't normal. I mean, the fact that we were so deep underground, me and the dude were kind of freaked out, but we didn't display that outwardly, because we're trained to not do that. But internally, I was like, what the hell is going on? And when they talk about awkward stuff, they didn't say it like, by the way, aliens are real, like you're anything like of that sort. It was just, oh yeah, this is the awkward technology division. This is Chuck, this is whatever. And just started talking like everything was normal. And we just went along with it because we hadn't thought it was normal. But the first time I'd ever been exposed to it. And it was a lot to take in. So that can be part of it too. Immediately, let's recall the infographics witness whistleblower who claimed anchors were utilized by UAP recovery operators to keep them quote grounded in reality. Dr. Gary Nolan has also done extensive research into the effect of UAP on human cognition. Whatever the phenomenon is, it's capable of manipulating human perception, human consciousness. Right. The other piece of technology R.A. observed is very difficult to describe. He sees it almost as a tablet similar to a gauntlet, something you would put your arm inside. R.A. stated this second device was referred to as a piece of weapon technology, due to the tech producing an energetic discharge during recovery. And same with the other the other thing that looked like something you would put your arm inside, as I described. And supposedly with some type of weapon system that they had recovered from the craft, they knew as a weapon system because it had it had discharged or something, an energy pulse. And they just had talked about that briefly. But all this was like third party saying what they had heard about the object. So they were talking about it between the two guys that worked there. And I think they exposed more than they were supposed to in just in their conversation. And I don't know that they weren't really trying to be much secure with what they were saying. They're pretty comfortable or they've been dealing with this stuff for a while. And this wasn't a big deal to them. So that that was awfully, as you can imagine, because I'm getting exposed to something that's telling me that everything I believe about the world is different. And I'm freaking out inside. And these guys were talking about it like it's no big deal. Like we're at lunch. He said that it was an uncomfortable feeling. But yeah, he he described this stuff. Because I don't remember asking questions. I'll never be like, well, what's it what how did you know this weapon? How do you know that's a weapon? And he said, Oh, they had discharged in the process of them recovering it, that they had discharged an energy pulse or something. Somebody was injured in the process. And they were talking about it a little bit. And then the guy would be like, Oh, remember, they had something other guy would be like, Oh, yeah. And then he was taken to that hospital or whatever. They were talking about it like they were filling each other reminding each other of something about the incident, you know, and that's how we got the information. This weapon technology device was projecting a type of writing that reminded RA of hieroglyphics. I don't know how to describe that man. Almost hieroglyphic, I guess. RA didn't ask about this writing. He wondered if it was even real due to no noticeable projection mechanisms on the device and thought if the characters were actually being displayed into his mind. But during our conversations together, I did run many of the famous symbols and iconography from ufology by RA, such as the famous Roswell I beam, allegedly found amongst the Roswell wreckage depicting NHI symbolism or language. It wasn't until I got to a relatively obscure reference that RA identified iconography similar to what he saw. In 2021, Luella Zando's attorney, Daniel Sheehan, made some startling remarks at UFO mega con. Sheehan claimed in 1977, under orders from President Jimmy Carter, who did have a verifiable interest in UAP, to scour classified portions of Project Blue Book. Now, we've talked extensively about classified programs parallel to Blue Book, so I will skip that for now, but immediately the testimony of Steven Lovekin comes to mind. Amongst the boxes of materials, Sheehan claimed to have come across a series of five or six photographs depicting a downed saucer-shaped UAP, quote, there were maybe five or six in this series of photographs and it hit in this field that had snow on it and it plowed through this big ditch and you could see across this field and it was stuck in the side of this embankment, end quote. Something about these images really stuck out to Sheehan, quote, here's the semicircle of the craft, like this and the edges here, and they were a series of these straight lines with dashes and dots and little horseshoe shapes like this, and they went all the way around the bottom. But that's exactly what they looked like. And it didn't look like the ones at Roswell. These are different. Now, I don't remember in which order they were or the exact sequence, but that's exactly what the shapes were and it was all around, right around the base of the dome of the saucer. I could tell they were Air Force guys because it was snowing and they had these big furry hoods on with their jackets and stuff. And you could tell that they were really excited. You could tell from looking at them as they were photographing this thing, end quote. RA states the symbols Sheehan drew look quite close to the symbols projected from this anomalous technology. And guys, real fast, we do know Blue Book ran from 52 to 69. And since these images are from a classified section of Blue Book, can we factor in the USAF soldiers and snow to try and determine a recovery event? Of course, this isn't the topic of today's video. But let's just take a quick peek. One such possibility is the 1952 Spitzberg in Norway event I will cover in the future. Interesting story here that has some confusing pathways and possible misinformation. Most of what we know here is that the CIA took an interest in reports of a crashed 47 meter disk. Besides this Norway case, not many fit our conditions, so possibly this was actually a retrieval operation that was kept under wraps. After a short time, the two green berets were escorted out of the offworld technologies division. We were escorted out the same way we were escorted in. We went back to the training room until we had been working in and we had a brief, like debrief, like a quick debrief with the guy. I think I remember, I don't remember if that's when we signed some stuff or not. Did you sign anything? And I was like, I don't remember particularly, but afterwards I thought about it as like, I do think we were signing something. But that's not, we do that all the time with everything. It's always just handpaper to you to sign in the military. So it would be hard to pinpoint like, yeah, at this moment we signed an NDA. I probably signed 10 NDAs then didn't know. We were escorted out. We talked about it briefly and then me and the guy had walked back to the parking area together. We were going back to the same hotel. We were talking about it. We were actually staying in the same hotel. So we got back, we talked about it a little and we were both freaked out by the whole thing. Getting back to their hotel, R.A. and his fellow soldier experienced some real ontological shock. R.A. and I are trying to get in contact with the other soldier. After this event, the two lost contact due to not being stationed together. And R.A. even heard rumors the other soldier was killed during a combat operation. We were both in that same, like he was like, what the fuck? You know, that's, that's where we were. I mean, we go back, got back to the hotel and was like, what the fuck? Like, what was that? He's like, so this is all real? Like, we're, we're going through that whole thing, you know? Well, I haven't seen him in years. I try to track him down to talk to him about this. And I wasn't able to find him or get a hold of him or how does that picture? We weren't, we weren't stationed together. We didn't serve together. We were in two far apart units. And, you know, we never was able to find him. And somebody told me he passed and on a mission and that he was going, I don't know. So I don't, I don't know any other way. But I mean, I never spoke to him after that our time together there. After his experience, R.A. did not contact Arrow nor did he contact David Grush, Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, or any of these notable figures. R.A. did not want his name known publicly. To this day, R.A. performs op for opposing force training exercises for special forces units at Area 51. The stuff I do with DOE, Department of Energy, Area 51, they control that land. They hold all the contracts up there. And I'm here and I have a TSSI that was active for 12 years. So they'll pull me in and help you train projects. During his training operations, R.A. has been exposed to all types of advanced drone technology, including sphere drones. He says have often been mistaken for UAP and drones disguised as local fauna during the invasion of Syria. He estimates many modern UAP sightings, not all, but especially orbs are in fact highly advanced military drones. I've been exposed to drone technology. I still work, I do work out at various, it's more indicationally still. So like some of the orb technology and so I've seen it. It's not that cool to me anymore. I don't really care. A lot of the stuff that people are seeing is our shit. So but and this really piques my interest. R.A. has also heard of human made triangular craft that operate off of a electro gravitic propulsion. For anyone who wants to learn more about electro gravitics, I highly recommend checking out my friend Jesse Michaels video, the scientist who built UFOs for the CIA starting at about 17 minutes and five seconds. Due to a trusted military contact, citing of a triangular shaped craft, R.A. estimates there are human made triangle shaped craft and NHI based triangle shaped craft. Is this a possible reference to the reverse engineered TR-3B? No, I don't think it was either. I think it was completely foreign, alien, whatever. By the way he described it, the time frame he's talking about, just the way he described it is there's some differences because I asked specific questions that I knew to ask and it wasn't the same. For example, the lighting underneath our craft is incandescent or it might be something more advanced, but it's almost like an incandescent light. So it's turned on and off with a switch, you know. The lighting that he described was like always on and responded to the ship. So I guess the ship would do stuff. You said the lights would brighten the dim. Like he said windows are wasn't even one solid and he drew all this stuff down. He just said it was seven or eight, maybe nine lights that went along the perimeter of the triangle and which are our craftfulness three than I thought, you know. And so this he said had multiple and the size was also the big one. He said it was like the size of three football fields. They're not years at times. And that's just his guess. And it was simply the sound like ours give off a fucking weird sound through these drones, human made triangles and other human made technology are a has seen some truly impressive military tech. But in his own words, all of this pales in comparison to what he observed at the offworld technology division. So RA, a green beret and 18 bravo weapons specialist was sent for weapons training to the naval surface weapons center in Crane, Indiana, whose mission is to provide the American war fighter with the solutions to their toughest technical challenges to better equip a decisive advantage in electromagnetic warfare, strategic missions and expeditionary warfare. Here he learned about domestic and advanced weapon technologies and their implementation into the modern battlefield. Due to his TS SCI clearance, RA was taken with a fellow green beret to Crane's underground section to view more classified tech. His guide, a skinny private contractor employee took the men to a secluded section of crane titled the offworld technologies division. Here, RA was shown tech made by non human intelligence. Technology cranes best and brightest had no idea how to operate. Technology possibly considered to be weaponry. Tech RA was told interacted with a conscious being. NSWC crane employs a whopping 2489 contracting force and does business with numerous defense companies. But one company stands out from the rest due to their historical implication with UAP programs, research into human consciousness and massive contracts with Crane, science applications, international corporation SAIC was started in 1969 and has historically specialized in information technology, engineering and defense, enjoying numerous massive contracts with the Department of Defense. But before we get started a few things, one I need to mention my good friend Kermit for helping me out with the SAIC research. He specializes in researching specifically SAIC so the man is a genius, you can find him on Reddit as frog in badger, his link to his profile will be in the video description. Two, I need to mention the testimony of former SAIC employee Denise McKenzie, who appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document. McKenzie stated that in the hundreds of millions of dollars awarded to SAIC for government contracts, most contracts had almost zero associated activity. She surmised that black budget money is hidden within legitimate programs and contacts. After discussing these discrepancies and contracts, McKenzie faced harassment within the company. The key to beginning this investigation is analyzing the massive contracts SAIC has enjoyed with NSWC Crane for myriad purposes, such as this 2024 $63 million contract to support NSWC Crane's hypersonic advanced concepts. Weird how this article must be accessed on the web archive, SAIC's internal site pulled this link down around June of 2024. Or how about this 2023 $240 million IDIQ, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity SAIC contract to support Crane's Weapon Division instrumentation platform. Weird how this link also disappeared around January of 2024. Another article pulled off of SAIC's site is this 2020 $133 million contract providing mission engineering and integration support for maneuver, engagement, and surveillance section of Crane. And these are just a few contracts, there are many more of interest, such as this 2010 $351 million contract for SAIC to provide technical engineering services to NSWC Crane. This specific contract aimed to support the Joint Special Operations Response Department, JSOC. If you've never heard of JSOC well, this is the department named alongside the CIA's Office of Global Access tasked with UAP crash retrieval and collections. Another video for another day, guys. SAIC's connections to Crane are so massive, we can find myriad modern day job opportunities as a contractor there. And what you may not know is the intimate relationship between SAIC and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of Aero. The good doctor has actually published patents under the company. SAIC has even participated in weapons testing at Crane, quote, our team is right in the midst of that, providing expertise and quote, said Diane Wilson, who manages support for the Small Arms contract. She heads a highly skilled passionate team that she describes as, quote, totally focused on bringing the best technology and the best weapons into the hands of the warfighter, end quote. Sounds very similar to the claims of RA's contractor who was instructing the Green Berets on weapons testing, does it not? So what about SAIC's connection to UAP, reverse engineering, and key here, consciousness related technology? Well, to start, SAIC is eligible under the DoD's corporate portfolio program. Remember how David Grush had private contractors work hand in hand with DoD elements on UAP programs nestled within special access programs? Well, the corporate portfolio program gives defense industrial based corporations like SAIC access to DoD executives, scientists, and management with broad access to special access program portfolios. If this NHI weapons testing program is being siloed to the Navy at Crane and SAIC, this is likely a set of contracts that falls under systems engineering and technical assessment slash research and development, with money split between acknowledged and unacknowledged special access programs. And with the slightest bit of research, we can see that the corporate portfolio program was established in 2020 by former Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lorde. After leaving the Pentagon in 2021, she joined SAIC as a strategic advisor. And this brings me back to that 2020 $133 million contract providing mission engineering and integration services for the maneuver, engagement, and surveillance division of Crane. We observe this contract with Crane is an R&amp;D project and falls under special warfare and expeditionary systems. One subset of the contract is the Special Capabilities Branch of Crane. Does this specific contract highlight money going towards the Off-World Technology division? And the connection here gets even more exact and more strange. To mention briefly, SAIC even published a paper around 1990 titled Electric Propulsion Study. This study, referenced by Jesse Michaels relating to T. Townsend Brown in UAP Propulsion, discusses electrogravity. A propulsion mechanism mentioned by RA and often associated with human attempts at NHI craft, such as the Fluxliner Allege Reverse Engineered Craft, or ARV, mentioned by aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish, which operated off of electrogravity propulsion. But does anybody remember the CIA Stargate program in the 1970s and 1980s? The program aimed to study the potential of remote viewing and psychic phenomena for military applications. This program spearheaded by defense contractor SRI International was terminated in 1995 due to the program claiming it had no useful results. There was a corporation doing parallel research into such mental phenomena and consciousness research around this time, and yes, you guessed it, SAIC. SAIC also continued to study these subjects post-1995 when the programs moved out of the military. Diving into this territory is somewhat uncomfortable for me, but let's remember David Grush discussing the Stargate program on JRE. We seem to just possess other skills. I mean, it goes back to like the Stargate program, right, you know, with Declassified by Clinton and sensibly canceled, I guess, in 1996, you know, where you had people trained in remote viewing and like there was feedback loops to confirm what they saw was real and either satellite imagery or human sources where they sketched out a room of where there's hostages and they got a hostage out and they're like, and this is a real story, actually. And Ross Colthart in his Reddit Ask Me Anything stating one word we should be paying attention to is psionic. And of course, the dictionary definition for psionic is the practical use of psychic powers or paranormal phenomena. Right off the bat, there are three extremely impactful SAIC studies I want to mention, protocols for the use of human subjects from SAIC's cognitive science laboratory, and a comprehensive research plan for anomalous mental phenomena from SAIC to the Defense Intelligence Agency, both written in 1991. We also have a 1995 paper titled Evaluation of a Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena, which states SAIC evaluated the research of SRI International and the Stargate program to continue research internally. Here we see another paper titled An Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic Funding. We can see SAIC even coined their own terms for psionics. Anomalous cognition describing extrasensory perception, aka a sixth sense. An anomalous perturbation describing psychokinesis. While these terms may seem extraordinary, we can find a now-deleted 2012 Office of Naval Research paper on a human sixth sense, aka extrasensory perception. So while this territory of psionics and researching human cognition is uncomfortable territory for me, according to RA, the Naval Surface Weapon Center holds off-world technology handled by private contractors, and the technology somehow interacts with conscious beings. While SAIC and the Navy have approvable interest in this field of psionics and human cognition potential. And guys, this is all just mention of SAIC's connection to crane and anomalous human cognition research. There is so much more to discuss with UAP and SAIC, it probably warrants its own video. Like how Commander Will Miller, one of the key players in the Wilson Davis memo, labeled SAIC as one of the prominent contractors who are quote-unquote keepers of the secrets in regards to UAP programs. Or the Stephen Greer 1996 briefing to Congress, which labeled SAIC as a quote-unquote crown jewel relating to UAP projects and facilities. Or lastly, SAIC's inclusion in Catherine Austin Fitz's paper stating quote, large proportion of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels, end quote. To support Black budget military research and development, I spoke about this paper in the Wilson Davis video, but SAIC and Lockheed were two of the IBM contractors labeled as responsible for obfuscating data on siphoned DoD funds, leading to a failed DoD general accounting office audit. A simple Google Duck Duck Go or any browser of your choosing search will yield zero results for the off-world technologies division. I have personally scoured thousands of documents trying to find any mention of this program named by RA to be nestled within Crane. And well guys, we do have one lead worth chasing. In his book Magic Eyes Only, which is one of the greatest books ever written on crash retrievals, author Ryan S. Wood discusses the legitimacy of the MJ-12SOM-01 or Special Operations Manual. This leak document covers from A to Z, quote, extraterrestrial entities and technology recovery and disposal, end quote. For contextual relevance, Wood mentions a document that appeared in the MJ-12 leaks, allegedly sent by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This memorandum titled The Special Committee on Non-Terrestrial Science and Technology discusses the application of quote unquote, non-terrestrial technology and the continuation of the quote already hardened research for advanced weapons program, end quote. This title and effort sounds extremely similar to the off-world technologies division description, but the connection here goes deeper. In this memo, Dr. Vannevar Bush is named. If you haven't, I highly recommend checking out my video on Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the U.S. UFO crash retrieval and technology exploitation programs. Physicist and member of the Scientific Research and Development Board, Robert Sarbacher, was outspoken regarding the involvement of Dr. Vannevar Bush and covert UFO programs. During an interview with legendary UFO researcher, Stanton Friedman, Sarbacher name dropped one Dr. Eric A. Walker as a crash retrieval member. Viewers of this video will remember a series of interviews with Dr. Eric A. Walker. Walker dodged many questions when asked about things like the MJ-12. He outright confirmed he was present to the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash, and he also said a few sentences that are often overlooked but incredibly strange in the context of the off-world technologies division and consciousness related technology. This technology RA observed required a conscious observer to perform, activate, or whatever it does. When asked about people within the UFO issue, Dr. Walker discusses how few people are capable of handling this issue. He states, quote, how good is your sixth sense? How much do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it and how to use it, you would not be taken in. Only a few know about it, end quote. Another DOD slash DOE contractor involved with NSWC Crane I want to briefly explore here is Sandia National Labs. If you remember from my 1950s Dell Rio crash retrieval video, UAP crash material were allegedly stored in the Atomic Energy Commission Sandia Labs facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. In that video, I drew the connection to AT&amp;T, manager of Sandia at the time, being implicated in UAP technology transfer. SAIC has massive contracts itself with Sandia National Labs, such as this 2013 five-year 228 million dollar IT consolidation contract. But what really interests me here is this 2023 technology transfer between NSWC Crane, Sandia Labs, and other participants for advanced hypersonic technology. Of course, hypersonics have existed since the 1970s with Soviet vehicles, and there are sources connected to the IC that tell me Sandia's stealth plasma physics regarding hypersonic craft is of real interest here. However, I do think this is worth mentioning because of some interesting context. In 2023, attorney Daniel Sheehan implicated the defense contractor Radiance Technologies being involved with UAP reverse engineering. Sheehan claimed Radiance's prompt global strike program leveraged reverse engineered UAP technologies for their hypersonic missile development program. Probably not much of a connection here, but after Sheehan's claims, it is interesting to see both SAIC and Sandia National Labs connected to each other and NSWC with the hypersonics program. The connection between the U.S. Navy, SAIC, and UAP programs go even deeper. Meet NASA mission specialist Bob Ulsler, a now deceased engineer who explored robotic sciences and created remote controlled machines for the U.S. space agency. Ulsler had a keen interest in UFOs. In 1989, Ulsler met with Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, whose incredible credentials include former NSA director and director of naval intelligence. Inman told Ulsler about quote unquote recovered vehicles available for research. Do you anticipate that any of the recovered vehicles would ever become available for technological research outside of the military circles? Again, I honestly don't know. Ten years ago, the answer would have been no. Whether a time has evolved or they're beginning to become open on it is a possibility. Inman even referred Ulsler to speak with Everett Heineman of the CIA, DS&amp;T, and former director of naval intelligence Sumner Shapiro for more information on UAP recoveries. In 1992, Inman would leave the federal service and join the board of SAIC. According to Ulsler, an alien contact by Timothy Good, Ulsler met retired rear Admiral Shapiro under the guys he was interested in working within the group that manages UAP information. Shapiro stated to Ulsler that the U.S. possesses extra terrestrial vehicles and that Shapiro had even studied one up close. According to Shapiro, teams would disassemble the craft, pack up the parts and ship them to labs across the continental United States. Did NSWC Crane receive some sort of craft component? Navy suits thought to be utilized as a weapon system? If you want to learn more about Ulsler, see the video description for a series of interviews. I may cover him further in the future as Ulsler has much more to say about UAP, including the possibility the Navy utilizes EMP weaponry to interfere with craft flight systems. So perhaps there's some really interesting further research to be done on the U.S. Navy in particular, testing and receiving parts of downed or crashed UAP. And to touch on briefly, back in 2017 at Navy Air Station Pax River, American aerospace engineer and inventor with a PhD in mechanical and aerospace engineering, Salvador Pais, filed a patent for a triangle slash diamond shaped craft that exhibits anti-gravitic effects and strongly resembles a TR-3B, a ledge reverse engineered triangle craft. The patent was supported by Naval Air Enterprise CTO, James Sheehy, and then approved. This craft design described by Pais is able to create and manipulate fields and quantum vacuum around the craft, leading to craft propulsion. I'd leave this to smarter physics people than I, but I would really recommend watching Salvatore Pais's episode on Kurt Gimungals, The Theory of Everything. And in his book, In Plain Sight, Ross Colthart relays a conversation with former U.S. Navy director of science and technology development, Nat Corbett's. Corbett state he made a few quote unquote discrete inquiries into Pais's craft patent and Nav Air Pax River. None of his Navy colleagues had any information on Pais or his patents. Corbett stated quote, if there is anything near a working anti-gravity craft, they've kept it very quiet end quote. Pax River is a very important message here. Located in Virginia, Nav Air Pax River is almost a counterpart to Nav Sea Crane. Pax River also has a storied history of contracts with SAIC. Pais, his patents exotic propulsion, Nav Air and Pax River were worth briefly mentioning to me just due to the strangeness of NSWC Crane's Nav Sea's sister facility Pax River. Perhaps similar programs of NHI technology reverse engineering efforts are conducted at this facility as well. What's up guys it's Gerb, I hope you enjoyed this look into RA and the off-world technologies division nestled within NSWC Crane, Indiana. This project has been exceptional for me to work on. I've got to talk to some incredible people like RA. I need to shout out again Kermit for all the SAIC research and just the amount of research that stemmed from this small testimony. I mean let's think about this. RA stated that he was at an SWC. He was taken deep underground by a contractor. I'm willing to bet my best bucket it's an SAIC person shown an off-world technologies division with two pieces of technology on display that interact with human consciousness. This begs the question are these the only two pieces of technology that this off-world technology has or are there multiple and these really are what kind of RA was thinking about just put on display. Right now I'm working with RA to actually get some drawings and possible 3D models of what he saw. I think that would really help everybody kind of visualize what he's seen and so forth. I was stunned at the amount of available research just from hearing about these two objects especially the symbology that RA saw and how it connected to she hand symbols. When he stated in 2021 he saw these on an image of a downed craft. Just truly truly fantastic stuff. I forgot to mention in the video just because there's so much I couldn't fit everything in. In I think late July of 2023 RA contacted Stephen Greer and the disclosure project to tell this story. He emailed them about his story and they never got back to him. So that was weird but if you want to read about his files in there I think he's witness number 10127. But I really hope you guys enjoyed this. Let me know what you think with the off-world technologies division and its connections to you know possibly that FDR MJ12 memo from 44. There is an offshoot of parallel research here and this is just incredible that this ties into the MJ12 and everything too. So I really hope you guys enjoyed this video. I'm sorry it took me so long. This has just been a lot of investigation a lot of research as we can see that this off-world technologies division has research from everywhere from NSWC Crane in their contracts with SAIC all the way to Salvatore, Pais and Pax River. So if you guys wouldn't mind drop a like, drop a subscription and share this video around if you can. You know I can't get the same sort of video output as some of the other creators in this space. I got a lot more research and stuff to put into my video. So if you could share it around I'd appreciate it and let me know below what you guys think of RA and his story. Let me know if you have come across any other stories that may fit into this investigation. Help me investigate further. If you know or if you've heard of the off-world technologies division please tell me because I would love to have any sort of documents or research I can. There is one really interesting tie-in I've been thinking of lately. Does anybody remember when Jason Sands came public on Twitter? You remember the whistleblower that came before him his name was Steve who actually introduced Sands didn't say him by name but kind of set his story and this is what had Sands come forward on Twitter. Well do you remember the other guy who came forward I think on Courtney I can't remember her last name's page his name was Martin he claimed to be in like a kind of remote viewing programs growing up. Well I listened to his testimony and one of his claims was that when he was a part of these programs there was a time where I think there was eight scientists brought a briefcase into a room and opened it and in this briefcase was a sphere the size of a basketball very clear looking that Martin was told chose who it interacted with I think he said so I've actually connected with Martin I'm talking to him now I'm really keen to get to the bottom of his story too and see if there's any sort of connections I can make there because this is just really perplexing as I said in the video just kind of the stuff with consciousness SAI's research into remote viewing and stuff this is really weird territory for me I'm a real nuts and bolts type guy when it comes to UAP I like the fact so whenever there's any sort of distortion of human cognition like in the whistleblower like in the infographics whistleblower video or technology that interacts with human consciousness or like p3 assets like Mike Herrera talks about it's all very new territory for me so you know it's strange expeditions for me I'm sure it is for you too sometimes just because growing up I am just the UFO guy I like the craft I like the crash retrieval I like the reverse engineering but the more you study this phenomenon I think the guys on mysterious universe said it the stranger it gets a lot of a lot of high strangeness and weirdness gets here so again guys remember to leave a like and thank you so much I will catch you all in the next show</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/QJ215I85d5M/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Arrow</li> <li>Bob Ulsler</li> <li>Bobby Ray Inman</li> <li>Catherine Austin Fitz's</li> <li>Chris Mellon</li> <li>Chuck</li> <li>Clinton</li> <li>Corbett</li> <li>Courtney</li> <li>Crain</li> <li>Crane</li> <li>DOD guidebooks</li> <li>Daniel Sheehan</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>Denise McKenzie</li> <li>Diane Wilson</li> <li>Eric A.

His name was Nat Cobitz. He was the US Navy's former longtime director of science and technology development. Their chief R&amp;D scientist, their chief geek for many years, for over 30 years. He was a beautiful guy, and it was an act of courage on his part. I remember one of the conversations I had with him was, do you think there's any good reason? Because this is the thing I wrestle with, and I know you do as well. What's the dirty secret? Why can't we know this? You know, if the US has recovered technology, why can't we know? And he hadn't been told that. And he had that rigid doctrinaire thing about how he wasn't read into that part of it. And that was a compartmentalized issue. He wasn't entitled to know about. What he told me was that he'd been told that the United States had recovered multiple craft, multiple craft. And he implied very strongly that Roswell and another case I'm interested in, Aztec and Kingman, all real incidents. It didn't start or end with Roswell. On this channel, we have covered myriad of UFO crash retrieval cases ranging from brief overviews to exhaustive, full investigations. These cases differ greatly. Some featuring a wealth of witnesses, paper trails or threads of investigation, such as 1933 Magenta, Italy, 1965 Kexford, Pennsylvania, in 1953, Kingman, Arizona, while other cases are plagued by a lack of witnesses, controversy or incomplete investigation, such as 2008 Needles, California, 1950 El Indio, Texas or 1974 Koyame, Mexico. There is one UFO crash retrieval case that seems to exist somewhere in the middle, a case that is often overshadowed by the most infamous UFO crash retrieval case of all time, 1947's Roswell, that occurred just eight months after in northern New Mexico. This case is marred by controversy, yet bolstered by tremendous investigation and witness testimony, a case that has been debunked, labeled as a hoax several times over, but yet still refuses to die. The 25 March 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash retrieval. This incident to me offers unbridled insights into the complexity of UFO crash retrieval, while the story of the saucer and biologics retrieval has remained consistent across the decades from several unconnected first and second hand witnesses and informants. The accusations and reprisals levied against those who have dared to discuss Aztec are indeed astounding. I'm sure many watching this video are already apprehensive to hear the word Aztec, after all, the Aztec crash is not without its problems. The initial sources of the story, Silas Newton and Leo Jabauer are after all convicted conmen, so this means the case is a simple hoax as Wikipedia and several UFO researchers like to point out, right? Or is the reputation of these men and the quality of the endless debunks against Aztec just as complex as the rest of the story itself? Why in the world would I cover a case that so many have written off as a hoaxed event perpetuated to sell oil-finding devices? Taking a step back and analyzing almost 80 years of research on this case reveals to me, just as William Steinman titled his 1986 book, that Aztec is indeed a well-kept secret. From similarities with the Aztec crash transport and the words of former director of naval intelligence Sumner Shapiro in conversation with NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler to the possible involvement of some of the United States' most legendary scientists including Vannevar Bush, John von Neumann, and J. Robert Oppenheimer. To bizarre late 40s and early 50s efforts by US agencies such as AFOSI, Air Force Office of Special Investigation, and FBI's attempts to intercept photos of the crash disc, every single avenue of the Aztec case is rich with the call for investigation. The Aztec crash may just give us access to travel back in time and analyze the fledgling years of UFO legacy program operations. Not only to study how the United States' top minds were employed to study recovered technologies of unknown origin, but also to gauge the severity with which UFO retrieval teams would attempt to rectify the public folly that was the July 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. So, travel back in time with me to the early morning of 25 March 1948 onto a rocky mesa just 12 miles northeast of Aztec, New Mexico, and let's investigate the case of an enormous crashed disc of non-human origin taken into the custody of US military and scientists and the ensuing sophisticated campaign of organized disinformation. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we discuss a case that in my opinion requires a Herculean amount of analysis and investigation, the 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash retrieval. This investigation serves to comprehensively analyze the story of Aztec, the witnesses, sources, and reporters involved, the attempts to prove the case a hoax, as well as the possible structure of early UFO crash retrieval organizations in the possible involvement of the ever elusive Majestic 12. So, did a 99.9 foot diameter disc manned by 14 to 16 humanoids really crash just south of Durango, Colorado in 1948? Did Bush, Oppenheimer, Von Neumann, and other esteemed scientists personally investigate the retrieved disc? Did the interplanetary phenomenon unit really disassemble and take the craft to Los Alamos National Labs? Or is this case, just as Wikipedia would have you believe, just a simple hoax by the con men Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer will join me today as we try and find out. And before we get started, as I just mentioned, the structure of the Aztec case is labyrinthine, possibly purposely so, and due to the complexity of this case we will primarily reference six key sources, three of which are sublime books written about the crash saucer, the legendary 1950s behind the flying saucers by Frank Scali, which introduced the world to Aztec. 1986's hidden gem, UFO crash at Aztec, a well-kept secret by one of my favorite UFO researchers, William Steinman, which resurrected the case while naming possible officials and scientists behind the retrieval. 2015's the Aztec UFO incident, the case, evidence, an elaborate cover-up of one of the most perplexing crashes in history by Scott and Suzanne Ramsey, which carefully and excellently evaluates the witnesses and sources of Aztec, addresses skeptics and debunkers, and carefully evaluates the case as a whole. The last, which is technically a collection of works, is the legendary UFO researcher Leonard Stringfield and his magnum opus UFO crash retrieval status reports one through seven, which introduces a plethora of new witnesses, sources, and information to the case. You may have noticed here, I only listed four of six sources. Well, this is because we will also address, study, and evaluate the two major debunks to the New Mexico flying saucer retrieval. 1952's flying saucers and the mysterious little men, written by the jealous JP Kahn, which shot to destroy the Aztec case, author Frank Scali and Scali sources Silas Newton, and the amalgamation of nine scientists called Dr. G. Kahn falsely labeled as one singular man, Leo Gabauer. As well as 1975's, the flying saucer crash of 1948 is a hoax by Mike McKellen, which released just one year after sources of Leonard Stringfield breathed new life into the case. Now real fast, last thing, many who watch this channel know Steinman's book is one of the most elusive and coveted UFO crash retrieval books of all time. After all, only 1,000 copies were ever printed. But guys, I am thrilled to say for this project, I have purchased this title for myself so we can enjoy high quality scans of pages and images. And with all that out of the way, let us finally dive in. Following the Second World War and sitting at the dawn of the Cold War, the Southern U.S. State of New Mexico was ripe with atomic energy and weapons development. The state employed numerous high powered radar installations to defend crown jewel weapons testing in RDT&amp;E facilities, such as Los Alamos National Labs, White Sands Missile Range, and Sandia National Labs from Soviet bomber attacks. By 1948, the year of our incident, the elder UFO legacy program Gatekeeping Structure, the Atomic Energy Commission, was engaged in one project, Twinkle, a program that analyzed UFOs, including green fireballs at Los Alamos, Sandia, and Holloman Air Force Base. Therefore, I'd say it's safe for us to assume the Atomic Energy Commission in the newly formed United States Air Force radars detected an object of unknown origin near Aztec, New Mexico, roughly 160 miles from Los Alamos. Indeed, sources of William Steinman would appear on record in 1986, claiming the craft was identified by three separate Southwest radar installations. Viewers of my channel will likely recall mention of Los Alamos and Sandia in almost every single project I do as engaging in UFO legacy program operations from craft and material housing to TUO or technologies of unknown origin exploitation, and we will expand on this much more later on. Numerous eyewitnesses described seeing a low-flying saucer-shaped object wobbling as if it were in peril, colliding or nearly colliding with nearby mesas until it was seen crashing in nearby Hart Canyon. The subject of local eyewitnesses to Aztec is of tremendous importance to our investigation, and we will discuss virtually all publicly named Aztec witnesses later on in our investigation. Citizens, ranchers, two policemen, and nearby oil field workers quickly arrived to the crash scene. To this day, it is still unknown what caused this crash after Roswell. Several researchers believe somehow high-powered radar interfered with the craft's propulsion systems. These sentiments were shared by Colonel Philip J. Corso of the U.S. Army Foreign Technology Division, who theorized the Roswell crash just eight months prior had crashed due to radar interference. This becomes all the more interesting as we describe this crash retrieval. All eyewitness accounts describe the craft as fully undamaged, but perhaps there is credence to the theory the craft was down via high-powered radar. During their boots on the ground crusade to validate or falsify the Aztec crash, Scott and Suzanne Ramsey met with one Lee Crane. Crane worked in the Aztec area during 1950. Crane discussed how USAF personnel from the El Vado 767 AC&amp;W radar site originally the Los Alamos radar installation to protect Los Alamos, and one of the sites likely involved with the tracking of non-human saucers would frequent the same diner as Crane. These Air Force personnel would bring in freshly killed, half-cooked ducks that they stated had been knocked out of the air by powerful microwave radar being used at the facility. Now viewers of my channel will absolutely recall, as recently as my project on SAIC, that I frequently discuss how Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative, built to protect the United States from Soviet ICBMs, secretly engaged in highly compartmentalized, deep-sixed UFO program operations, some of which harnessed STIs, lethality, and target hardening or particle beam weapons programs to offensively target UFOs with microwave or X-ray weaponry. In this project, I discussed how SAIC would have likely been the prime contractor aiding the SDI in shooting down non-human craft, and quite the interesting connection here. Possibly, these weapons against UFOs were accidentally discovered during the late 1940s. But now, let's get back to late March 1948 on top of the Hart Canyon Mesa. Consistent across eyewitness statements ranging from the sources of Skully, Newton, and the Ramses are reports of an enormous craft measuring 99.9 feet, resting virtually undamaged atop the Mesa at an angle. Though crashed, could this saucer have landed on its own guidance? The saucer appeared of a light metal composition, absent from any rivets, bolts, screws, signs of welding, landing gear, or propulsion systems. In the middle of the bizarre craft sat what appeared to be a crew cabin, an almost sphere measuring 18 feet in diameter and 6 feet in height. Locals from Aztec and oilfield workers began to climb aboard the craft, remarking how light the material was. In quickly on scene, witnesses described a helicopter flying overhead. The site was almost surreal to eyewitnesses such as Doug Nolan, as the likely Sikorsky H-5 series or Bell H-13 was quite new technology. Rapidly, men in uniform, unknown if army or air force, as the two were recently separated, pulled to the scene in jeeps that were befitting of the US Army. Multiple witness testimonies surrounding Aztec state the recovery effort was conducted out of the USAF Walker Base in New Mexico. Allegedly, personnel were flown to Durango, Colorado, where a short drive was completed to the crash site. This will be explored further later by witnesses such as USAF Airmen known as pseudonym George, and Walker Air Force Base was the new name for Roswell Army Airfield. The onsite military immediately separated citizens at the crash site, informing them never to speak about the incident and informing the locals on scene. The object was extremely important to US national security. Now, Frank Scully's early 50s recount of Aztec, as informed by Silas Newton, states investigators onsite were able to gain access to the craft via punctured porthole. As investigators approached the seemingly glass like windows, they observed these portholes were not glass, but indeed semi-translucent. Inside the craft, two humanoid bodies were observed slumped over an instrument panel that appeared to be but four feet high, charred, and possibly mangled. According to Scully, investigators jammed a wood or metal rod into the mysteriously punctured porthole poking and prodding at the instrument panel until a panel opened up giving access to the craft. Inside the vehicle appeared to be a separate crew cabin where 12 to 14 separate bodies lay dead on the ground. While the story of the crash, the retrieval process, and the method of gaining entry to the craft are near identical, Steinman's account introduces far more specific, such as named onsite scientific retrieval personnel. Steinman writes the 30 to 40-year-old seasoned military members on scene were members of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, a long forgotten US Army division shown to Steinman by the Freedom of Information Act to exist solely through institutional memory. IPU has its own controversy and juicy alleged report in the Majestic 12 leaks which we will address in a section specifically on IPU. According to Steinman's sources, the impact area of the craft was relayed to Air Defense Commander General George C. Marshall, who then contacted the IPU and head of the Majestic 12, the illustrious, head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush. Steinman first learned of the existence of IPU in the early 1980s so it is intriguing by 1986. He had learned the IPU allegedly operated out of Camp Hale, Colorado and served the function to collect and deliver disabled or crashed disks to certain specific secret locations. Now, Vannevar Bush in the M.J. 12. Bush is named Adnausium in the Majestic documents, most famously the Eisenhower Briefing Document as M.J. 1, the head of the secret organization created under President Harry Truman to act as the original UFO legacy program. But Bush's ties to UFOs are not solely relegated to the Majestic documents. Later in this project, we will discuss physicist and prodigy of Einstein, Robert A. Sarbacher, who claimed in 1950 UFO programs were classified higher than the H-bomb and operated under Vannevar Bush. Keep an eye out for this section later on. Accompanying Bush in the IPU was a team of eight other scientists we will touch on when we cover in greater detail Steinman's work, but these included Dr. Robert J. Oppenheimer, Dr. John von Neumann, and Dr. Detlev Bronk. Four of these men have been labeled as original Majestic 12 members. On site, according to Steinman's work, the team accessed the craft via punctured porthole. Inside the cabin sat two humanoid figures, with 12 more bodies littered across the chamber. With Aztec, we do see varying reports of 12 to 16 bodies. Instrument panels around the craft wall showed high-tech screens sprawled with glyphic-style writing. From Randy Anderson to Mark's 1991 Deep Sea Recovery to 1965 Kexburg, glyphic iconography is inseparable from non-human technology. A quote-unquote book was found inside the craft or better described as a pamphlet of plastic displaying the same glyphic-style writing. General Marshall allegedly passed this on to two leading cryptologists, William F. Freedman and Lambrose C. Calihamos, who were unsuccessful in their attempts to decipher the codes. Physiologist and biophysicist Dr. Detlev Bronk ordered the bodies to be placed on dry ice. According to Steinman's sources, Air Research Corporation supplied freezing equipment as director of R&amp;D of the corporation, Dr. Paul A. Scherer was both a colleague of Vannevar Bush and a cryogenic specialist. As a quick detour, I do find it rather fascinating in 1954 under the administration of the recent presidential incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dr. Paul A. Scherer was one of 12 scientists named onto the board of directors of a group called the American Association for the Advancement of Science that sought radical changes in the scientific community. This panel of esteemed scientists sought to harness global scientific advancements for humanity's progress instead of preserving, quote, the secrecy of scientific knowledge we already have, end quote. Seen as Dwight D. Eisenhower is often cited as the president who lost control of UFO legacy programs, who ran an administration in which non-human crash retrieval and material exploitation programs broke free from traditional oversight channels and gained unprecedented autonomy. How fascinating is it that Dr. Paul A. Scherer, a scientist alleged to have participated in non-human biologics retrieval in 1948, desperately sought to see the end of scientific secrecy under the guise of national security following the Truman administration? Dr. Bronk would allegedly go on to detail full autopsies for the pilots, which were published in the legendary Ever Elusive and Deep Sixth Project Blue Book Slash Sign Report Number 13. These bodies feature disproportionately large heads, slant eyes, small noses, and mouths. The creatures weighed solely 40 pounds on average with small torsos and thin necks. The fingers of the creatures were webbed and internal systems revealed no digestive systems or gastrointestinal tracts, no alimentary or intestinal canal, and no reproductive organs. Instead of blood, the circulatory system of the creatures was comprised of a colorless liquid with no red cells that smelled like ozone. These creature descriptions sound near identical to that of the EBE1 detailed in the controversial yet provocative 1950s Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual 1 I have covered in detail with Ryan Wood. Now, I must mention here is where there are slight variances between Scully's and Steinman's description of the biologics. Scully described the beans as almost perfectly humanoid, just scaled differently with perfect teeth. The retrieval process of the crashed disc at Aztec took up to two weeks. Helicopters certainly were unable to provide the necessary carrying capacity to retrieve the 99.9-foot disc, so how in the world was it extracted? These points here to me offer some of the most fascinating insights into Aztec. Some non-human craft and incredible testimonies hurt decades after the Aztec event. The craft was dismantled. The science team figured out the large ring of metal rotated around the centralized, stabilized cabin. Indeed, the scientists were able to dismantle the craft. The vehicle was manufactured in segments which fitted into grooves and were pinned together around the base. The vehicle was divided into the crew cabin in three equal-sized pieces of the disc. Now, stop me if you've heard this before. Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security Agency in the United States, deputy director at CIA, director of Naval Intelligence and a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man who had to know. So, I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the UK. And this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have possession of the hardware associated with this. In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon. A craft, a spaceship. Several of them, and they were in operational condition. Bobby Ray Inman, one of if not the most critical figure to this channel, served as director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, a four-star Navy Admiral, director of Naval Intelligence, deputy director of Central Intelligence, director of the NSA, and board member of SAIC Wackenhut and possibly DSAI. And Inman seems to connect to every project I do these days. I have multiple videos where Inman is discussed at length, so I highly recommend checking out any of these projects. Famously, in a 1989 recorded phone call with NASA mission specialist Bob Echler, Inman volunteered CIA directorate of science and technology deputy director and NRO program B director R. Everett Heineman as the person to ask about recovered UFOs becoming available for technological research. Inman would additionally connect Bob Echler with another former director of Naval Intelligence, Sumner Shapiro. In 1989, Echler met Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with the quote-unquote group that managed UFO information. At this time, Shapiro was retired as DNI and served as an executive with BDM International. BDM, of course, is another former defense contractor purchased by Northrop Grumman I have directly accused of being involved with the UFO Legacy program operations. Shapiro informed Echler, factions within the U.S. possessed extraterrestrial vehicles that he, Shapiro, had even studied at close quarters. According to the former DNI, teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them around the country to different laboratories. The craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an exact sequence to be put back together. Was Shapiro talking about the Aztec case? After all, in how many UFO crash retrieval cases do we hear of a craft being dismantled in a complex and direct method? Let's also focus on this rotatable crew compartment. USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet claimed the TR-3B alien reproduction vehicle whose propulsion systems were reverse-engineered by Lawrence Livermore Labs and Sandia National Labs from non-human propulsion systems featured a rotatable crew compartment within the triangle. The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring called the magnetic field disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore laboratories developed a reverse engineered MFD and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology but you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you. Anyways, after careful dismantling of the craft, multiple concrete pads still available to this day were constructed to assist three M25 Dragon wagon tank transports which were stored in New Mexico bases post-World War II. Indeed, the Ramses were able to find Bureau of Reclamation records from 1948 discussing heavy earth moving equipment, cranes, and low-boys being used to move concrete and steel structures in Aztec for the Manco's project. Mention of the Bureau of Reclamation possibly supplying equipment for moving of the Aztec craft gives us means to pause and reflect. Seen as in works prior, I have discussed tunneling contracts for tunnel boring machines under the Bureau of Reclamation secretly engaging in clandestine operations to aid in the construction of deep underground military bases in their alleged connective tunnel systems. The convoy carrying enormous pieces of a disk avoided roads to Aztec and drove the wreckage to Los Alamos National Labs. The bodies were transported away, likely to write patterns in Air Force Base, and the craft remained at Los Alamos for over a year before being transported again. The craft being shipped around serves as another nod to Shapiro, no? And quickly, just in case you are unfamiliar with my other work, mention of Los Alamos as the first destination for the craft is of massive consequence. I've previously discussed extensive ties with Los Alamos National Labs, a Department of Energy federally funded research and development center, and deep underground military bases, UFO legacy program gatekeepers, possible material exploitation programs, etc. But relevant to today's discussion, let's look back to 1994 to the words of former New Mexico State Representative J. Andrew Kistner. Kistner stated sources within White Sands Proving Ground and the Naval Research Lab informed him that two to four flying disks were recovered during 1947 and 1948, and the disks were possessed and analyzed by both Los Alamos National Labs and Sandia National Labs 7th Division under control of the Atomic Energy Commission. Kistner's sources claimed that institutions such as MIT, Brookhaven National Labs, the Rand Corporation, and Joint Research and Development Board, created partly and shared by Dr. Vannevar Bush, played a quote unquote major role following the 1947 crashes. Additionally prudent to Aztec, Kistner mentioned Project Supremacy, a possible UFO related program created in 1947 that operated specifically to track and perform data acquisition on triangulated New Mexico radar sites. The New Mexico State Rep would even state his sources claimed presidential executive order signed in 1948 allowed the Atomic Energy Commission full custody of the recovered disks with the National Security Council serving as program coordinator with support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Naval Research Laboratory, and Dr. Bush's Research and Development Board. One might recall here how Dr. Eric Davis spoke of PEEDS, a presidential emergency action document signed in the 50s by President Eisenhower to structure UFO legacy program operations outside of congressional oversight. In fact, post-Roswell early July 1947, leading up to the morning of 25 March 1948, we may have even more actionable intelligence that signifies elements of the United States government and military were actively engaging in establishing programs to deal with recovered non-human craft. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy, original accused MJ12 member and likely murder victim James V. Forestall, established AFSWP, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project. This AFSWP was tasked to manage nuclear weapons jointly staffed by U.S. Army and Navy. At this time, the AFSWP operated within Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs. As we know from the 2023 and 2024 UAPDA legislation, UFO data, materials, etc., have historically been misclassified as trans-classified foreign nuclear information under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement. This threat is indeed intriguing that possibly the AFSWP out of Los Alamos and Sandia handled the wreckage of both the Roswell and Aztec crashes and served as the foundation out of which the Atomic Energy Commission established a 1954 agreement to obfuscate and hide UFO data. But now that we have covered the basis of the Aztec crash, let's really start to dive in. The Aztec crash made its way into the public zeitgeist with Frank Scully's 1950 best-selling book Behind the Flying Saucers. Though Scully had previously written about this incident in 1949 in two variety magazine columns, Behind the Flying Saucers served as a second real book on flying saucers after Donald Keyhoe's Flying Saucers are real. Scully's book truly served as the impetus for conversations between physicist and consultant to Vannevar Bush's Research and Development Board Robert Sarbacher and Canadian radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith that would ultimately lead to Canada's first two official programs on UFOs, Project Magnet and Second Story. We will expand on this much later in the investigation, and I also have an entire video on Sarbacher. But Wilbert B. Smith asking Sarbacher about Frank Scully's best seller and how much of it was ultimately true led to one of the most fascinating memos of all time. Sarbacher informs Smith that not only the contents of Behind the Flying Saucers were fundamentally correct, but also that flying saucers exist. The subject of UFOs is classified in the United States even higher than the H-bomb. And efforts to capture and study UFOs were spearheaded by Vannevar Bush. Scully's book reported the Aztec incident as we discussed prior. Besides the data from Steinman, which we identified, Scully also reported that up to 1950 there had been four such recoveries. Within the book, Scully suggested based on his plentiful sources, UFOs operated on magnetic principles, and that finally brings us to Scully's sources, the linchpin of this entire video. Scully's source of the Aztec crash was one Mr. Silas M. Newton, a complicated, questionable, and intriguing character who requires ample time to investigate, as well as Mr. G, an amalgamation of up to eight scientists. Newton claimed no first-hand experience with the crash retrieval, bar-handling equipment retrieved, souvenirs claimed in pieces taken from the crash. Newton's information came to him from his close, first-hand confidence, the enigmatic Mr. G. Indeed, a 1952 debunk on Aztec attempted to label Mr. G as just one man, the equally complicated Leo Gabauer, but this is simply not the case. Using the work of Suzanne and Scott Ramsey, as well as William Steinman, we will actually attempt to name as many of the Mr. G's as possible later in this investigation. After all, throughout the book, Scully would describe the collection of G's as having, quote, more degrees than a thermometer, end quote. Scully and Newton would take these names with them to the grave. Scully first heard of the Aztec event from Silas Newton, owner of the Newton Oil Company with a truly checkered past. The two had a relationship for multiple years, and early on when discussing flying saucers, Newton invited Scully to the Mojave Desert to test an oil-finding device called a doodle bug that Newton would later on face charges for, a fraudulent device that may just have more basis in reality than Hoke's arguments would admit. Newton would introduce Scully to Dr. G, and Dr. G would tell Scully much of what we had covered today, the recovery being intact, low salamos retrieving the vehicle, the craft operated by magnetism, and that some sort of plastic pamphlet was found in the craft with symbols that were not successfully deciphered. Dr. G infamously showed Scully a cube-like device that admitted sounds like a radio, and small gear-like objects and discs that they claimed originated from the Aztec craft, implying these men were actually at the crash site. The men would even show Scully images of the craft, and keep this in mind as these images will become important throughout the video, even Scully's widow claimed she had personally seen these photographs. But Scully wasn't the first person to whom Silas Newton would disclose information on Aztec. No, after receiving information about the crash from the enigmatic pool of Mr. G, likely scientists with whom Newton had previously worked alongside in the oil industry, and before the publishing of Behind the Flying Saucers, Newton had lectured on the crash event at the University of Denver on 8 March 1950 under the pseudonym Scientist X. At this lecture, Newton took the place of the original speaker, possibly a Mr. G, and discussed the flying saucer crash in an effort to interest the students in UFOs. Thankfully, radio salesman and engineer George Kohler from Denver KMYR who was friends with Newton and possibly some of the Mr. Gs helped set up this event. Kohler investigated the lecture, and thanks to the Ramsay's keen research skills, both the recording as well as items from Newton's drawings on the chalkboard were found in Scully's archive. In this 1950 lecture, Newton discussed a crash of a flying saucer that occurred two years prior in a 500 mile radius to Denver, drew details of the craft seen on screen now, and discussed complex magnetism as the craft's propulsive force. Clearly, this lecture did not go unnoticed, as the day after the lecture, months before the release of Scully's bestseller, Air Force Office of Special Investigation visited KMYR Denver looking for Kohler. After two days of trying, Kohler was interrogated by Special Agent Hansen in Unger about Newton, flying saucers, possible cube-like radios retrieved from the crash, and more. Thanks to the Ramsay's again for finding and reproducing this interrogation, in a bizarre twist of events following Newton's lecture on the saucer and the release of behind the flying saucers in September of 1950, multiple other U.S. agencies were tracking leads and leaks on the Aztec crash. On 30 September 1950, the Army CID, or Criminal Investigation Division, reported that a sting operation was staged at the Edelweiss Bar in Melwyn Hotel in Denver. FBI and CID were trying to intercept the sale of photographs of the Aztec saucer from one LD McLaughlin to Mr. Klein from the Baltimore Sun. The Ramsay's filed Freedom of Information Act requests for more documents than the scant few we possess, but were informed that all were destroyed, and in another fork in the road, there was no Mr. Klein that worked for the Baltimore Sun at this time. So six months after Newton discussed the Aztec crash at the University of Denver, the FBI and CID attempted to intercept photos of the crash, and remember, Scully's widow claimed to see such photos. Shortly after the release of behind the flying saucers, the case was at large labeled a hoax due to a September 1952 publication by San Francisco Chronicle writer J. P. Kahn. Kahn effectively killed the story by making the retrieval appear phony, discrediting Scully in his most damaging act, discrediting Scully's sources, Newton and Dr. G. After all, around the time of J. P. Kahn's article, Newton and one Dr. G, Leo Gabauer, who Kahn labeled as the singular man behind Dr. G, were charged with defrauding Denver businessman Herman Flater. Around the use of an oil-finding device we discussed called the Doodle Bug. This damning publication and context around Kahn, Newton, and Gabauer's charges are well worth our time and analysis, as there is far more here than meets the eye, including questioning the sourcing methods and honesty of the hero of the hoax, J. P. Kahn. To quote the Ramses for decades, the 1948 Aztec crash has looked like this quote. Frank Scully's story was going along great until a top shelf journalist by the name of J. P. Kahn broke the big story of a bunch of Kahn men who had robbed poor investors out of their life savings in a worthless oil scheme so that they were destitute and standing in bread lines. Thank God for J. P. Kahn. He saved the day by exposing these Kahn men who were taking in money and never paying a dime back. These horrible Kahn men were arrested and sent off to jail, and the Aztec story was nothing more than a fiction concocted by a bunch of bad and nasty crooks. End quote. While Newton is far from the only source and witness of Aztec, the story has largely been marred and labeled a hoax due to Kahn's damning piece on Newton. Predating behind the flying saucers, Scully and Kahn actually shared history. In 1949, Kahn approached Scully when he got wind of the saucer story in Variety Magazine. Kahn wished to capitalize off of the craze that was flying saucers. Kahn attempted to purchase the flying saucer story for the San Francisco Chronicle from Scully in a disgraceful lowball. The two failed to agree to terms with Scully defiantly resting on his laurels of the validity of the story over any amount of money. Strangely, Kahn returned to the Chronicle claiming to his superiors that he and Scully had actually agreed to terms. During these failed business dealings, Scully had introduced Kahn to Newton at Scully's home. Kahn became almost obsessed with Newton and the Aztec story, following Newton to San Francisco to get a one and a half hour meeting with the oilman. Newton would write regarding the dinner with Kahn, quote, the talk was saucers, saucers. The theme of their talk was that I owed something to the world and I should let the Chronicle guide me end quote. End quote. The meeting lasted one and a half hours. They wanted their great conservative paper to get to the bottom, document the whole thing, and if they thought it was true, then give it to the world, end quote. Ironically, Newton also said, quote, they would satisfy anyone that they would protect the identity of all concerned, end quote. Kahn would fully turn his story pitch away from Scully towards Newton, wishing for Newton to assemble the entire roster of Dr. G for $25,000 in 1952 money in 50% royalties in any publication. Kahn would famously state in his debunk that during these meetings with Newton, Silas showed him quote unquote gears from the crash site. But dubiously, Kahn would steal one of these pieces, have it tested, and determine the relic was simply common aluminum. Now as it turns out, these pieces from a saucer given to Newton were indeed copies, and while Newton and Scully had more than likely seen the real collection of items from Dr. G, the items in Newton's possessions were little more than replicas. This approach by Newton does make logical sense here. Recall in 1950, AFOSI interrogating radio salesman Kohler about parts from a flying saucer the day after Newton's University of Denver lecture. In addition, recall how the FBI and Army CID were actively hunting Aztec photos. JP Kahn would, as a nail in the coffin to Aztec, label one Mr. Leo Gabauer as the sole Dr. G and implicate the two men in oil fraud. So before we move on to this criminal case that effectively shredded Newton, Scully, Dr. G, and Aztec, let's go ahead and dive into Gabauer. Leo A. Gabauer was a phoenix based physical scientist that specialized in magnetics. Gabauer was a known associate and friend of Newton, and one of the inventors refers to harness the oil-finding devices infamously called the Doodle Bug. Now quickly, I have seen some reports that state Newton and Gabauer claimed the Doodle Bug operated off of non-human technology recovered at Aztec. I have never seen any of these statements from Newton, Gabauer, or Scully that claim this. In fact, the Doodle Bug seemingly has far more basis in scientific reality that we will discuss soon. In his debunked piece, Kahn defiantly stated Gabauer was the sole Dr. G and Newton had informed him of such. The basis for this claim, none. Gabauer would continuously state in writing, sworn in court, etc., that he was not Dr. G, so Gabauer was not the Mr. G, but was he a Mr. G? This point is extremely interesting, as Gabauer may have been in fact one of the Dr. G's relaying information to Newton, but like everything with this story, nothing is so simple. In 1986, Steinman would suggest Gabauer and Newton were a targeted leak of information from none other than a real Dr. G, Majestic 12 member, and scientist on site for the Aztec crash, Dr. Carl A. Highland. Dr. Highland was the founder and owner of the Highland Research and Exploration Company based in Denver. Highland was born in Hamburg, Germany, attended the universities of Heidelberg and Hamburg, gaining his directorate in the latter in 1923, destined for a career in geology and geophysics. Highland came to the US in 1935, where he worked as a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines, and operated within the nearby oil fields. During his time in Colorado, Highland worked alongside many of the scientists we will discuss in this chapter, and more than likely engaged with Leo Gabauer for work on magnetic detection devices as well as successful Denver-based oil man Silas M. Newton. Some even suggest Highland was originally the scientist X, supposed to speak at the 1950 University of Denver lecture until Newton took his place. Researchers outside of Steinman have come to the same conclusion, such as one Richard Ogden, who wrote in his 1960s unpublished book that he deduced the field of scientist who could in fact be Dr. G, based on Solly's description and arrived at one Dr. Carl A. Highland. After all, Scully would state one of the Mr. G's lived in Denver and was able to fly to the Aztec crash site in two or three hours and that Newton drove with him from Denver to Phoenix. But let's get back to Scully, Newton, Kahn, Gabauer, and the story of the court case. After failing to purchase the saucer story from Scully and Newton, being duped by the copy parts after stealing from Silas, and whether malice or ignorance falsely labeled Dr. G as one Leo Gabauer, J.P. Kahn acted on his vendetta to destroy the Aztec story, both on paper and behind the scenes. This can be confirmed in a 15 June 1952 letter from Scully to the attorney of Silas M. Newton, A. Brigham Rose. The letter discusses Kahn approaching Scully in 1949 when he got wind of Aztec from Scully's Variety Magazine article. By 1951, Kahn had tried and failed repeatedly to purchase the story. Kahn quickly became obsessed with Newton and admitted to Scully he had stolen Newton's replica craft material and replaced it with slug. The letter additionally stated by late 1951, Kahn visited Scully saying he had been duped, claiming Newton and G were to be arrested, that he wanted the hoax exposed and to be written under Scully's name, otherwise they would accuse Scully of being involved in the hoax as well. On 25 April 1951, J.P. Kahn wrote to J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI regarding Silas Newton. The letter stated that Newton had leaked the Aztec case to Scully and that he was a man with a checkered criminal history. Kahn also tipped off Hoover that Newton was engaged in the preparation of a hoax or swindle of large proportions. Strangely enough, the director of the FBI found time to reply by 3 May 1951 stating the FBI was, quote, to determine if Newton is violating federal statutes in claiming to be engaged in government research of a secret nature or in the perpetration of a hoax or swindle of large proportions, end quote. By 15 May 1951, Kahn responded to Hoover alerting that director information had been made available to FBI special agents regarding Newton's activities. Now, I find it extremely odd the director of the FBI would find time to reply to a San Francisco Chronicle writer within a month. Perhaps as FBI and CID were conducting sting operations to intercept Aztec photographs in 1950, the bureau was keen to chase down any leads surrounding the Aztec case. After all, the FBI did have a bizarre file on Newton written roughly one year prior on 31 March 1950. This letter also written to Hoover stated that allegedly a redacted name was told to have said to another redacted man, Silas Newton, aka Mr. X, had knowledge of a flying disc in recovered bodies. Some of the details here are incorrect, of course. However, it is intriguing the FBI was already keeping tabs on Newton just a few short weeks after his Denver lecture on saucers. And just a few short weeks after, AFOSI interrogated the man who recorded the lecture, George Kohler. I also find it equally fascinating Scott and Suzanne Ramsey pried 289 pages of Silas Newton documents from the FBI, yet the bureau claimed 100 plus pages were still unreleasable. The FBI did register multiple documents on Newton before Khan got to them. One file dated 18 February 1941 reported that, quote, Silas Newton had a very substantial income, good character, good habits, and no record of lawsuit, collections, or bankruptcy. Both his companies were reputable concerns, and there was no indication of espionage activities, end quote. Now of course, the time period of FBI and J. Edgar Hoover investigating Newton does encourage us to reflect on the 1950 HODL memo. On 22 March 1950, J. Edgar Hoover received an official memorandum from Washington Special Agent Guy HODL concerning information on flying saucers. The memo discussed information relayed to Special Agent R. H. Kurtzman by police Special Investigator Carl Howe and his unnamed informant. According to the memo, an Air Force investigator stated three flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico, measuring 50 feet in diameter with raised centers, manned by humanoid biologics that measured three feet tall dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. These saucers were apparently found in New Mexico due to high-powered radar setup in New Mexico interfering with saucer mechanisms. Until this memo was released fully redacted, many thought the source of this information was Newton. While the memo discussed crafts similar to Aztec, albeit off-dimension-wise, it is intriguing to continuously hear descriptions of high-powered radar interfering with craft mechanics. Anyways, I digress. Khan's outreach to the FBI was very successful. Khan additionally located one Herman Flater, a Denver businessman who had a series of successful, poor, and speculative business deals. Flater had invested large sums of money into Newton's oil wells, which paid him pretty handsome royalties. And the doodle bug, Flater was convinced would make him millions of dollars. Recall the doodle bug was a term used for an electronic sensing equipment device used to find oil, gas, water, and whatever else the inventor claimed the unit could locate. Khan told Flater, quote, you will never see a nickel of your investment because you, my friend, have been victim of a Khan artist, end quote. This quote was reported in Frank Scully's book, Armor Bright. Over his dealings with Khan, Flater was convinced the two men should seek the FBI to pursue legal action against Newton. In 1951, Flater eventually wished, with the aid of the FBI, to file a criminal case against Newton in his compatriot of the doodle bug, Leo Gabauer. As he decided, he felt hustled out of 250 grand by the two men. Again odd, as Flater was actively receiving royalties from Newton's successful oil fields. Flater would claim that every time Gabauer utilized the doodle bug machine, he had positive results. However, every time Flater would use the device, nothing happened. Curiously, the FBI could not find one federal judge to entertain a federal criminal case in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, all states in which Newton conducted business. Flater's attorney eventually went to a magistrate in Denver to prosecute the case locally, and charges were filed on 10 October 1952. The initial charges levied at Newton in Gabauer was, quote, interstate transportation of stolen property, end quote, which was defined as Newton transporting Herman Flater's personal checks across state lines to California to deposit them into his bank account. The next charges levied were quote unquote worthless machinery, which led to the arrest of Gabauer in Phoenix and Newton in Los Angeles on 18 October 1952. Whilst building the case, the FBI found 32 of 33 of Newton and Gabauer's investors were quite pleased with their investments. Flater was the standout pressing charges. The trial started on 10 November 1953, and proceedings lasted until 29 December 1953, when Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer were found guilty of fraud. Based on the work of William Steinman analyzing court records, it is crucial to analyze how this case was prosecuted. Disgruntled businessman Herman Flater was the first prosecution witness to take the stand, presenting his main complaint as his, quote, inability to operate Gabauer's oil detecting device, end quote. Flater's testimony lasted two weeks, and again, he felt as though Newton and Gabauer defrauded him of $250,000. On 17 November 1953, the defense for Gabauer presented, as evidence, a signed contract by Flater that gave him interest in three of the oil detecting devices in return for his investment. Flater strangely denied signing these documents, however, eyewitnesses testified to observing Flater's sign. On 20 November 1953, prosecution called Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Professor Dr. James Meredith to the stand. Meredith was asked as an expert in geophysical exploration, if he could prove Gabauer's doodle bugs were legitimate tools. Meredith was shown a device that was, quote, unquote, very similar to Gabauer's oil detecting tool, but not his device. The device presented in court was one that the district attorney had purchased at a local war surplus store for $4.45 and was, quote, very similar to the one Gabauer used, end quote. The Colorado School of Mines doctor testified regarding the false instrument, quote, these so-called doodle bugs couldn't detect submarines, much less oil and or gas deposits, end quote. A second witness, this time a research engineer for the University of Denver, examined the same knockoff devices and testified that it, quote, couldn't find anything, end quote. Now let's also take a look at the defense here. Defense attorney Melman served Flater with a subpoena, ordering Flater to produce a small health machine he supposedly produced and sold part interest into Silas Newton and Leo Gabauer. So in the same exchange of interest here to this court case, Flater was buying into the oil detecting device, but Flater was also trying to sell Newton and Gabauer on a nebulous, quote unquote, health machine. The judge bizarrely decided that this health machine was not relevant to the case. The second witness called by defense testified with photo evidence that Gabauer had successfully located three water wells on his company property. Additional witnesses claimed Gabauer's device had successfully found oil on their 100,000 acre land, quote, Mr. Gabauer's machine defined 35 oil wells for me. Earlier this year, 1953, I sold 89% in one of these wells for $1.75 million, end quote, testified oil Tejon field ranch owner Horace Steele, quote, I drilled two wells on my own initiative after Mr. Gabauer told me not to. On the basis of surveys taken by his machine, both of these wells turned out dry. I paid Gabauer $10,000 for the complete survey. It was worth every penny, end quote. Mind you, according to court records, JP Kahn was on the sideline assisting every step of the way with the prosecution of Gabauer and Newton. In a rather bizarre twist on 18 December 1953, prosecution called Thor Severson, a Denver Post reporter. Severson had attended Newton's March 1953 university lecture on flying saucers. According to court records, Severson showed a now famous photograph displaying Scully, Newton, and George Kohler and claimed without evidence this meeting conspiratorially discussed oil detecting devices. The confusing trial of Newton and Gabauer eventually came to an end. The two were found guilty of fraud and faced up to 30 years in prison, but the case evaporated. The men were never sentenced and faced no fines. Curiously, Newton agreed to pay a sum of $18,000 to cover court costs, as though this was a civil case, not criminal prosecution. But the damage was done. The Aztec story was officially dead and buried. Kahn's conquest of vengeance had been successful. Even though upon his passing, manager of Kahn's estate, Robert McClay, produced cover art for Kahn's attempts to push more flying saucer stories in the 1960s. With the facts of this case, one must ask why were Newton and Gabauer even charged? Scott and Suzanne Ramsey argue this court case was punishment to Newton for introducing Dr. G to Scully, wasting Newton's time delivering him stress and draining him of tremendous amounts of money. Closer to modern day, many who disclose information on UFO crash retrievals or alien reproduction vehicles face similar reprisals. These include Jonathan Weigant and Mark McCandelish, both of whom were craftily targeted by the IRS after their disclosures. Now after that entire long-winded court case section, and before we move on, we must discuss a never-finished autobiography dated 1954 written by Newton and found within the Scully archive by Scott and Suzanne Ramsey. Quickly, let's recap what we know about Newton. Newton was born 19 July 1897 and earned a bachelor degree at Baylor, studied at Yale, and performed postgraduate work at the University of Berlin. Newton became a successful oil entrepreneur because of his background as a geophysicist who studied petroleum under the earth. The oil man's relationships would lead him to connect with Leo Gabauer and Dr. G, where Newton both likely heard about the Aztec crash and prototype oil-fighting devices. Newton would disclose data of the crash alongside Dr. G to Frank Scully and even take the place of a lecturer at the University of Denver in 1950. Newton is also a convicted, but never sentenced con man, and as we discussed, there is more than meet the eye to his court case. But what did Newton have to write about himself? Within the manuscript, Newton wrote openly about his friendship with Gabauer and did in fact have a business deal that went south with Denver businessman Herman Flater. Newton saw his University of Denver lecture as the focal point of his entire story. Indeed, the manuscript shows Newton had a deep fascination of magnetics and displayed both an admirable effort to understand the history of magnetism as well as strong conviction flying saucers did indeed operate off of magnetic principles. Again, Newton recounted how he originally was not supposed to speak at this lecture. One of the quote-unquote men of science, likely comprising Dr. G, was to be the lecturer. quote, some four years ago, I dared to stand before an audience in a so-called hall of learning and tell a packed body of students a story I had heard about a phenomenon on which are guardians of space. The Air Force, together with the Air Force of Canada and Great Britain and other nations, have spent millions trying to identify what they term unidentified aerial objects. They also call it quote-unquote project blue book to give it a proper cloak of mystery here in the USA, end quote. Newton defiantly stated regarding the lecture quote, as to my talk, it wasn't long before the finger of prosecution began pointing my way and they've scorched my hide already, but I haven't recanted, end quote. And while on the subject, a quick note here is well worth referencing. In the 1970s, UFO investigator and former CIA officer Carl Flock claimed to have obtained a diary kept by Silas Newton. This diary allegedly discussed Newton revealing that in the early 1950s, he was contacted by US military officials who wished to speak to him about Aztec. Newton was told the military knew the Aztec story to be bogus. However, they still wished him to spread the story far and wide to whoever would listen. Flock never produced this diary and after unrelenting pursuit by Scott Ramsey, admitted his source for this diary was Newton's nephew. Now, Newton's sons were both still alive at this time, so one might ask why Newton's nephew would be in possession of the diary. But nevertheless, Flock never produced material evidence of these statements. But back to Newton's manuscript, Silas recalled his tarring and feathering with a rather melancholic tone, writing quote, when the day comes and one of the silent invaders of our skies sets down and we are greeted by the people of another planet. I'm wondering if they too will be stoned in the marketplace. Me thinks they already know our ways and ere they do visit us, they'll be in a position to protect themselves against our gangster methods and our shoot first and investigate afterwards system, end quote. In the manuscript, Newton would discuss how Canadian radio engineer Wilbur B Smith had his complete and unwavering admiration for studying saucer magnetic propulsion. And this revelation is enormous and we will soon relate it to Sarbacher. Newton's fascination with magnetics makes perfect sense when we piece together that likely before World War Two, Newton knew select oil and gas scientists who went into top secret work for Vannevar Bush during World War Two. These scientists, as we will discuss soon, would have been an ideal team to study downed UFO saucers found during 1947 to 1950 and Newton would have likely stayed in touch with them to assist in the development of magnetic anomaly detection devices or MADS that were then and still are called doodle bugs and possibly receive first hand information on UFO crash retrievals along the way. Indeed, according to the Aztec UFO incident, a separate 1950 wire recording archived at the University of Washington saw Newton speak of doing magnetic research in the Mojave Desert with a top magnetic scientist in 1949. In this recording, Newton recalled mentioning reading about flying saucers to the scientist, to which the scientist retorted that he had driven from Denver to Phoenix and when he drove past New Mexico, he thought he wished Silas Newton was there so he could show Newton where the saucer had landed. According to Newton, the scientist recalled the Rocky Plateau northeast of Aztec and how they, the scientists in the military, had arrived from Durango, Colorado. Miraculously, I do believe I have found this exact wire, or one similar recorded three March 1950, so let's listen to Silas himself. In the summer of 1949, while engaged in magnetic research in the Mojave Desert in California, I was driving one day with one of my associates who happens to be rated the top magnetic scientist of the United States. In conversation with this gentleman, I had occasion to mention a report about flying saucers. I said, Dr, do you happen to know anything about them? His answer was starting. He said to me, he said, I thought about you last week when I came down from Denver to Phoenix. When I passed Aztec, New Mexico, I said to my wife, I wish Silas was here, because I would take him out and show him where the first flying saucer landed in the United States. I said, Dr, do you mean to tell me that one of these ships landed and that the American people don't know anything about it? He said, two telescopes saw this flying saucer or an unidentified ship, and they watched its position on the telescope and estimated approximately where it would land. Within two to three hours after the landing, our force officials reached the flying field at Durango and took off in their search for this object. When they found it, it was in a very rocky, high plateau territory about 16 miles east of Aztec, New Mexico. They immediately threw a guard around it, and about seven of our magnetic group of scientists were called in to examine this strange ship. Now, before we move on, I leave you with this powerful quote on page 228 from Newton's manuscript. I have, however, not only been libeled and lied about, but I have been pictured as the deliberate author of the whole idea. And to follow it up, the same people who defamed me in print then framed up a prosecution that even at this hour seems to me like some horrible nightmare from which I will awaken in time. The Ramses and myself share the sentiment the trial of Newton was targeted retaliation for leaking information about the Aztec case. William Steinman presents a far more dramatic and consequential reason for the court case of Newton and Gebauer. These conclusions will also lead us to discuss in depth the doodle bug, which may just be the linchpin of the whole case, tying in together Aztec, Mr. G, Newton, Scholle, Gebauer, and possibly the Majestic Twelve. Recall how Steinman's investigation and sources led him to conclude Dr. Carl A. Highland was not only one of the real Mr. G's, but also an MJ-12 member and first-hand participant of the Aztec UFO crash. Dr. Carl Highland owned the Highland Research and Exploration Company based in Denver, Colorado. Steinman claims Highland's business was quite familiar with devices used for detecting oil wells and water, and that Gebauer had even consulted with Highland's company. Steinman's theory goes Highland and Gebauer sought ways to test modified and developed magnetic aerial detection equipment from World War II, anti-summering programs, and thus the two engaged with oil man Silas Newton. In fact, Steinman argued Highland and Gebauer were not only acquaintances, but also research compatriots. In his book, Steinman and Furs, Gebauer, and Highland worked and lived together in 1935 in Antarctica for a US government research project. According to the researcher, the two would later be involved with top secret development of magnetic aerial detection, anti-summering technology, and then post-war, adapt such technology back to underground oil, gas, water, and or other detection. I should, however, note that Steinman does not offer exhibits of evidence or context around these statements, so while I have no reason to doubt him here, we still cannot prove Highland and Gebauer 100% worked and lived alongside one another. Furthermore, Steinman would also claim Gebauer worked at the Phoenix and Los Angeles Division of Air Research Company. Recall how Air Research Company and its founder, Dr. Paul Sherer, a colleague of Vannevar Bush and member of the Research and Development Board, was allegedly called to action to provide freezing equipment to preserve the Aztec bodies. Another interesting connection that I find little to back up, however, it should be mentioned the Ramses additionally stated Gebauer had served high positions within the Air Research Laboratories around 1946, according to Better Business Bureau records. But back to Highland, Highland was involved in early uses of the magnetometer for both geophysical exploration purposes and for detecting submarines during World War II. Steinman argued Highland was the initial source of the Aztec leak, disclosing information, photographs, materials, etc. to Newton and Gebauer. When the Majestic 12 or whatever UFO legacy program entity was controlling dissemination of information around this time found out, Highland was forced to withdraw from the March 1950 University of Denver lecture where scientist X, Silas Newton, took his place. Highland explained to his visitor that he could not do so with a clear conscience and look Gebauer in the eye knowing that they had both developed these devices together. This ultimately, according to the theory, led to Dr. James Meredith, a co-worker of Highland at the Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Department, to testify against Gebauer with fraudulent devices. Recall how Steinman connected the doodle bug with World War II submarine detecting equipment. This is where our story gets incredibly strange and perhaps there is more to the inappropriately named doodle bug than meets the eye. Remember, several witnesses testified in support of Gebauer and Newton that their device was indeed successful at finding oil or water deposits. Gebauer's device, if real, may have been an early iteration of a magnetic anomaly detection device or MAD and this device, like Steinman proposed, could have connected Gebauer and Newton to the Aztec saucer. Newton and Gebauer, as stated in Newton's never-finished autobiography, were familiar with scientists before the Second World War who were working on finding oil-finding devices that transitioned to work under Vannevar Bush for secretive submarine detection missions in both theaters of World War II. After all, according to Scully, the Dr. G scientists were quote unquote top shelf and worked on secretive projects during the Second World War. Scully additionally labeled some of the Dr. Gs as working out the means by which Japanese submarines were detected by magnetic devices. So let's really pull on this thread here. In 1930, a company was founded by Dr. J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott called Geophysical Services Inc. quote, Karcher was an American geophysicist and businessman who invented the reflection Seismograph applying for patents in 1919. He eventually commercialized the process by which most of the world's oil reserves were discovered. McDermott was a geophysicist and pioneer of providing seismic services to the petroleum industry. The original GSI was founded in 1930 to offer the first ever reflection Seismograph exploration services to the oil industry, end quote. In 1917, when John Karcher revealed his formula for calculating the depth of subsurface formations, he knew he had developed something very important. His discovery led to a plan for someday using seismic waves to map structures far below the earth's surface. The oil producing world would come to know the reflection Seismograph as the instrument which fulfilled that plan. I do not think it is any stretch here to assume GSI sought prolific and successful oil men in the American Southwest like Silas Newton to test their groundbreaking products. By 1939, the founders of GSI started another company which acted as GSI's parent company called the Colorado Corporation. The purpose here was to keep GSI in the reflection Seismograph business exploring oil and gas whilst the Colorado Corps could continue to branch into new ventures. By 1941, Eugene McDermott along with several key employees purchased GSI from Colorado Corp. Immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor, GSI and the reflection seismograph technologies were recruited to secretive projects for anti-summarine warfare. The National Defense Research Council was setting up the organizations through which university and industry people were to be pulled together to tackle specific jobs in technology and design for the war effort. GSI had a hidden asset, its long experience in building sophisticated electronic equipment for its own use. This experience and Johnson's frequent trips to Washington led to some engineering and development tasks for the Army Signal Corps and a contract for airborne magnetic submarine detectors for the Navy. By 1942, GSI had become a DOD contractor in Navy war production engineering, specifically focused on using their technology for submarine detection. GSI was recruited by the Office of Scientific Research and Development, an office set up by the US government during World War II to quote, engage the brightest scientific minds and the great machinery of industry in the pursuit of victory and quote, the head of this OSRD was of course accused MJ1 and lead scientist for the Aztec crash, Dr. Vannevar Bush. Working under Vannevar Bush, the OSRD and Navy War Department, GSI was divided into four groups, the Laboratory Manufacturing Division, Apparatus Division, Equipment Group, and Defense Systems and Electronics Group, aka DSEG. So hold on here and let's get this straight. GSI was developing oil detecting devices used possibly by Silas M. Newton before being recruited in World War II by Dr. Vannevar Bush and the OSRD in order to adapt their technology for anti-submarine programs. This ties in perfectly to the statements made by Steinman and Scully in their publishing. But that's not all here and far from it. GSI would later on in 1951 become Texas Instruments, a contractor accused of housing UFO legacy program operations. It is comical to me how Texas Instruments themselves refer to legendary GSI geophysicists, geologists, engineers, scientists, and others who performed seismic survey tasks as doodlebuggers. But as GSI sounds like a perfect corporation that fits the description of the workplace of one, if not multiple Mr. G's, are there any former GSI employees that really fit our conditions? One possible source of Dr. G was GSI co-founder Eugene McDermott. McDermott was a luminary and genius, himself registering five of the early GSI patents that greatly earned the respect of Vannevar Bush. If Bush did indeed spearhead the Aztec retrieval, a trusted and respected genius like McDermott would make an obvious candidate for a scientist on the team. McDermott was active with GSI since its inception in the 1930s, when GSI was largely working with oil and gas detection, possibly working in allowing Newton and Gebauer to test their technologies. McDermott was revered by his employees, such as Cecil Green, who would go on to serve as president and chairman when GSI became Texas Instruments. In a comical statement relevant to the subject of UFOs, according to Green, McDermott had extreme skills in reverse engineering almost anything he was given. The co-founder of GSI, J. Clarence Karcher, makes an additional possibility for a Mr. G, as he originally applied for patents in reflection seismology in 1921. According to an engraved monument, quote, proved the validity of the reflection seismograph as a useful tool in the search for oil, end quote. While not directly an employee of GSI, we have already discussed Carl Highland and how he possibly leaked the Aztec story to his compatriot, Leo Gebauer. Additionally, outside, but possibly tangential to GSI, we have two Mr. Gs of interest, Otto German Arnold Schmidt and John Tarrant's Tate. Schmidt was an accomplished expert of biophysics, bioengineering, electrical engineering, and magnetism. In 1937, Schmidt even performed research at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, which I have previously connected to undersea UFO crash retrievals. By March 1941, Schmidt was appointed by Dr. Vannevar Bush as the official investigator for the National Defense Research Committee, or NDRC. Shortly after, the NDRC evolved into Bush's famous OSRD, or the Office of Scientific Research and Development. As we discussed with GSI, the role of OSRD in World War II was clearly defined, a hard military focus helmed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. Schmidt would join John Tarrant's Tate retrofitting PBY Catalina amphibious bombers with magnetic detecting equipment known as MAD, Magnetic Anomaly Detector, later referred to as Magnetic Airborne Detector Device. As we mentioned earlier, Gubauer's device could have possibly existed as early iterations of the Magnetic Anomaly Detector. However, conclusions drawn by the fantastic research of the Ramses point specifically to John Tarrant's Tate as a likely Mr. G, quote, he had more degrees than a thermometer and had received them from such diverse institutions as the Armour Institute, Creighton University, and the University of Berlin, he is the scientist I have called Dr. G, end quote. Frank Scully when discussing one of the scientists known as Dr. G, Tate earned his master's degree in physics and electrical engineering at the University of Omaha, nestled in Nebraska alongside Creighton University, and earned his doctorate at the University of Berlin. During World War I, quote, Tate and his colleagues verified the existence of discrete energy levels and showed that there was a difference in the amount of energy required to spur radiation and the amount of energy that is needed for ionization. This helped connect Bohr's theory and those of Heisenberg and Schr\u00f6dinger in quantum mechanics, end quote. During the Second World War, Tate was recruited by Vannevar Bush to work for anti-summering programs with the NDRC, which would later on become the OSRD. Tate would enjoy prestigious positions during the war, including scientific advisor for the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet, Assistant Chief of the Office of Field Services of OSRD, and the Director of Operations, Research, and Chief Member of the Rocket Ordnance Division and National Defense Research Committee. In July of 2011, Scott and Suzanne Ramsey traveled to the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis to study archival material on Tate's life and work. Here they found evidence Tate had actually traveled to the Southwest at the time of Aztec. Quote, in front of a large audience, Tate stated that during a recent trip, he had experienced something that had changed his life. According to him, what he had seen could change the way that energy is generated, how food is produced, and overall how humanity could be served. This was a complete reversal of his normal retiring attitude, end quote. From Highland to Tate and Dr. G's relation to Newton and Gebauer, this chapter has served to attempt to unveil at least some of the nebulous Dr. G, and also demonstrate Gebauer's doodle bug was not a fanciful object bought for $4.45 at a surplus store, but instead based on real technology from real scientists, many of whom were connected with geophysical services Inc. that would bridge the technology for submarine detection equipment in World War II and foster close relationships with Vannevar Bush. Thus far, we have discussed the Aztec crash, according to our primary sources, outlined at the start of this project. I do want to spend a little bit of time narrowing in on some of the work Steinman did in his 1986 epic UFO crash at Aztec, a well kept secret. This enormous book only saw 1,000 copies printed, and as I stated at the beginning of this project, I have purchased a copy for high quality scans for this video. In his book, Steinman revolutionized the Aztec case by mentioning the IPU, MJ-12, and actually identifying the team of scientists he claimed were present for the crash recovery, including Vannevar Bush, Von Neumann, Highland, etc. Now, as much as I love this book and want to praise it, Steinman remained throughout the book, somewhat cagey about his sources and origins of information. Examples include definitive mention Leo Gebauer and Highland worked alongside one another without evidence, an involvement of the IPU without firmly stating his sourcing or rationale. So, as we have been doing, we must try and draw our own parallels and conclusions based upon the research presented. Steinman became intrigued with behind the flying saucers after he once read about the Aztec case in Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7. The researcher wrote his epic based upon the foundation the Aztec crash was true, but started back at square one to derive his own sources and methods. Viewers of my channel know I reference often and hold a great deal of respect for Steinman, a true researcher who admirably cold-contacted many figures associated with UFO legacy programs and crash retrievals. The case portrayed by Steinman is remarkably similar to the case discussed by Scully, Newton, and several Aztec witnesses completely disconnected from the original Aztec reporting crew. So, no, Sean Kirkpatrick, there is no circular reporting here. The major difference in Steinman's reporting is how access was gained to the craft. Thus far, we have heard different testimony of oil field workers to the recovery team exploiting an existing hole in one of the craft's portholes to open a doorway in the vehicle. Steinman's account states one of the accredited scientists on site observed a knob-shaped protrusion with a button in the middle through one of the craft portholes. The unnamed scientist thus ordered for the team to pick up hammers and beat the porthole glass out. Then we return to what we have heard already, where the team used a long pole to poke around in the craft and eventually open it. Intriguing to me in this passage here is Steinman's reporting Bush's team attempted myriad solutions to disassemble the enormous craft for removal, cutting torches, diamond drills, diamond cutting saws, and more. But no device would face the metal, let alone penetrate the material. Quote, finally, one scientist after a very thorough examination found a place on the inside where there was some sort of interlocking key device. When he pulled on the device, a seam opened up on the ship at that particular location from top to bottom. He continued around the ship and found several of these devices at equally spaced intervals. Here was the key to disassembly problem that they had been looking for, end quote. Again, I am strongly reminded of the words of director of naval intelligence and BDM board member Sumner Shapiro. In his work, Steinman professed to contain knowledge of personnel, brought in to study the craft over a year after its recovery. But unfortunately, he did not detail where and how he obtained this data, but it is, nevertheless, worth our time to study. Steinman stated, a little over a year and a half after the recovery, November of 1949 to be exact, Dr. Eric Henry Wayne was called onto the project. Now, does this name sound familiar to anyone? Wayne worked as a consultant to the Wright Air Development Center on Aerodynamic Metallurgical Design for the Structure Division and served on the staff for the University of Cincinnati. Wayne was also one of the key scientific figures mentioned along the 1953 Kingman, Arizona crash retrieval. I previously made a video on Kingman, one of my all-time favorite crash retrieval events, and of course, Wayne was mentioned. You know, David gave them first-hand direct information from his sources of where to look, where to find the spacecraft, where to literally go and open the door. Oh, by the way, there's a spacecraft recovered from Aztec. Open this door, oh yeah, that's the one from Kingman. If Wayne really was involved with Aztec, perhaps his efforts to understand the craft were indeed successful. Seen as during Kingman, while spearheading the Office of Special Studies at Wright-Patterson Airfield, Wayne was suspected of leading the reverse engineering team on the crashed non-human craft. As I said in my Kingman video, which still holds true, Wayne has proved exceedingly difficult to track down, almost as if he was erased from public record. All I can prove with Wayne is that he was indeed the head of the Office of Special Studies at Wright-Patt and involved with Operation Upshot Knot-Hole. The nuclear test thought to have been the impetus of the Kingman's craft's crash. All the way back in 1986, Steinman understandably found difficulty digging up info on Wayne, thus believing the Majestic 12 wished to keep their prize scientist off public record. Steinman was able to wrangle up tiny references to Wayne, his obituary for example, in the April 1961 edition of Mechanical Engineering Magazine. The obituary shed more light on this enigmatic figure possibly connected to Aztec and Kingman. Wayne hailed from Austria and after earning his degrees in teaching in Cincinnati, Ohio, Wayne began work on secret government projects in 1949 at Wright Development Center. In 1956, Wayne's department was moved to Sandia Laboratory Complex at Kirtland Air Force Base, where he remained until his death. Remember, Sandia and Kirtland are two of the most critical names in my research on UFO legacy program operation locations. Admirably, Steinman contacted an individual in Albuquerque who knew Wayne very well. The individual was mentioned only by the name MW. MW stated Wayne's personal papers were all confiscated by military intelligence upon his death, placed behind lock and key of a highly secretive section of the library at Kirtland Air Force Base. Wishing to discuss saucers off a line that was likely being tampered with, Steinman and MW planned to exchange letters. Steinman never heard back from MW, but did notice his mail being tampered with and a tracking device stuck to his van. Unfortunately, the enigma that is Dr. Eric Wang persists today. Who was Wang? Was he called in to assist with the Aztec crash in regards to study and duplication, and did he spearhead the 1953 Kingman crash recovery? Historically, the Aztec case has rested solely on the credibility of Silas Newton. Since he is a convicted conman, though the story is not that simple, the whole case has been labeled by publications such as the ever-reliable Wikipedia as a hoax. But are there eyewitnesses to the crash? Are there individuals who saw the disc, touched the disc, or perhaps participated in the retrieval first hand? Well, thanks to the tireless work of Steinman and the Ramses, yes indeed, we do. And let's briefly explore a few here. Valentin Archuleta initially disclosed his testimony to William Steinman in 1982 under the pseudonym VA. Archuleta served in World War II and was deployed to the harrowing eastern theater in the Philippines. Archuleta was captured, but miraculously survived the horrific Japanese POW camps. After the war, Archuleta served as a rancher in Aztec, New Mexico. Valentin claimed early one morning between 1948 to 1950, he was outperforming his usual chores. The rancher heard a large explosion. Looking in the direction of the sound, Archuleta observed a huge disc-shaped craft, larger than his house, with a dome on top, passed within 200 yards of him overhead. This disc appeared to be in trouble, skimming as low as 100 feet over the ground and wobbled as it careened overhead. Valentin described the disc striking the corner of a 150-foot cliff face, shooting sparks and rocks in every direction. The Ramses have sought and believed to have found this location. Archuleta proceeded to call the military in Albuquerque, aka Kirtland Air Force Base, a base I have on myriad occasions associated with UFO crash retrieval operations. Valentin requested the Air Force call him back to explain what was happening, but was never contacted again. Now, paramount to the whole Aztec story is, of course, oil. Recall, all the way back to the beginning of this video when we described the event, oil workers were some of the first civilians on scene. In 1948, 19-year-old Doug Nolan worked for the El Paso Oil Company. Early one morning, Nolan was on his way to pick up his supervisor Bill Ferguson to proceed to a grueling day of work in the oil field south of Aztec. Bill and form Doug, a brush fire, had started on Hart Canyon Road, 12 miles northeast of Aztec. Since this fire was supposedly burning near some of the company's oil drip tanks, the two dispatched towards the area. Arriving to the tanks, Bill and Doug were greeted by several other oil workers already on scene to investigate. The two were told something strange was sitting atop the hill. Quote, the craft was extremely large. We realized the craft was smooth with no noticeable seams, rivets, bolts, or weld marks. It looked as if it was molded. The craft was brushed aluminum, looking to be very smooth, but not highly polished aluminum, like you would see on an airplane, end quote. Doug and the other men climbed atop the craft, resting at an angle on the mesa, looking for some sort of entry point. The men found a small porthole type feature atop the dome, quote, the windows or portholes looked like mirrors until you would get closer, then you could see right through them, end quote. Just as the Aztec story goes, Doug stated one porthole featured a hole no bigger than the size of a quarter. Inside the craft, Doug would claim to see two bodies, quote, slumped over what appeared to be a control panel of sorts, end quote. Quote, by the time the local law enforcement showed up, Bill, who was ignoring the orders to stay away from the craft, was trying to poke around the craft with a firepull or something he pulled off one of the trucks. Soon, he hit something, and a door or walkway appeared. Some of us had to look inside and see what else was in there, and if anyone was in need of help, end quote. The small bodies inside were charred a dark brown, likely burned to a crisp, but the craft's interior was undamaged. Doug described the disc as 100 feet across, describing the craft as having a very thin cross section, only 18 to 20 feet high and very thin at the edges. Doug did describe some strange markings on the outer edge of the craft. Gold color rings, three if I remember correctly, that ran around the entire outer edge of the disc, end quote. Quite a number of locals began to arrive to the scene, according to Nolan, including cattle ranchers Mr. and Mrs. Knight, who warned the oil workers to get away from the disc. Doug's testimony recounts the circling of a helicopter overhead, which stood out to him almost as bizarrely as the disc. A law enforcement officer, now identified as Manuel Sandoval from the nearby Cuba, New Mexico, arrived on scene, claiming he had followed the low-flying disc in a northerly direction. Similar to Archuleta, Sandoval described seeing the craft as wobbly and fluttering like a leaf. The policeman quickly took initiative, ordering locals off the craft. More men, including a local officer, pulled to the scene, who informed Sandoval the military was well aware of the craft and that everybody should leave the area at once. The military eventually showed up, in Doug's words, in a very big way. Doug was impressed with how fast the uniformed men showed to scene. He was unaware if the men were USAF or ARMY, as the two were recently separated, but their vehicles did, according to Doug, look ARMY. Now, these men were not young guys, according to Doug's eyes. They appeared seasoned, assertive, and well-trained, possibly IPU, if Steinman's theories are correct. The military on scene quickly assembled everyone present and divided the people for interview. The uniformed men told Doug and presumably others, quote, This event was extremely important to the United States, that we were responsible for our national security and that we will never talk to anyone about this event, end quote. Other eyewitnesses described almost identical crash sites to Scott Ramsay. These include Ken Farley, who while on his deathbed in 1999, disclosed to Ramsay, Farley was visiting his aunt in Durango, Colorado, north of Aztec, and was on his way to Cedar Hill, New Mexico, to see a friend the early morning of 25 March 1948. After his friend suggested they check out a lot of activity on a nearby dirt road, the two drove to Hart Canyon Road. Following the dust and dirt clouds from other cars, the two men got out and walked on top of the mesa. The two men saw a huge object with people ranging from oil field workers to an older couple, possibly the knights walking around the craft, quote. We saw a large disc shaped object, aluminum in color, but not really very shiny, sort of dull aluminum. I could not see any structures as far as doors or windows. The entire craft was very smooth. The craft did not appear to have any damage, but lay on the mesa at a funny angle and sort of rested on its belly. The disc had a bubble or protrusion on the bottom from what I can remember, and also one on the top. It sort of reminded me of two pie pans with a bubble for a top and bottom. The top bubble was larger than the bottom. The craft was lying at an angle, maybe 12 degrees or so, end quote. Ken described the scene, two police officers on site, likely Sandoval and the local officer, were asking folks to leave. Oil field workers were climbing all over the craft and an old couple, again the knights, yelled at the men to get off. Shortly after, according to Ken, disgruntled military personnel arrived whisking people off site. In a truly incredible turn of events, the Ramses have located two Aztec witnesses on the side of the recovery efforts. In 2001, Scott Ramsey interviewed a USAF veteran by the pseudonym George. Ramsey states the identity of George was known by multiple researchers, including the legendary Stanton Freedman. George claimed to be stationed as an airman of the Walker Air Force Base in 1948. Formerly known as the infamous Roswell Army Airfield, George claimed the Aztec retrieval was indeed coordinated out of Walker AFB. Perfectly suited after Roswell Army Airfield had garnered experience retrieving non-human craft solely eight months prior. George explained to Scott Ramsey the retrieval operation was highly compartmentalized, with information restricted to a need-to-know basis concerning the work to which each individual was assigned, similar to the Manhattan Project. George's directive was to keep personnel records for everyone who was working the recovery. Though he was not in the loop on everything, far from it in fact, George claimed to see daily intelligence reports concerning progress made and people involved. George stated the retrieval process took every part of two weeks. Now, of course, if you've been paying attention, there is an issue here. If Dr. Carl Highland was indeed present at Aztec, George failed his duties as the Ramses were able to place Highland in the American Southwest at the time of Aztec. George recalled the Air Force based out of Walker Air Force Base and Army Fifth Base out of Colorado as well as a few other select basers or locations were involved in the crash. And recall how Steinman stated the U.S. Army Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit arrived to the Aztec crash from Camp Hale, Colorado. And while we're here, let's reference back to the U.S. Army CID slash FBI Sting Operation conducted in 1950 to purchase Aztec crash photographs. Far removed from Newton, Scully, or any of the main characters of the Aztec case, official memorandums discussing the Sting referenced the Fifth Army Intelligence Division Regional Office being involved in receiving information and interviewing witnesses surrounding the Sting. George claimed the personnel involved in the recovery were highly trained and seasoned, similar to the IPU claims of Steinman and eyewitness testimony of Doug Nolan. We can take this away from George's testimony. The issues with the Roswell recovery led to Aztec featuring new people and new procedures, and though George was not privy to policy, the Aztec proceedings were handled by highly trained professionals. He had no direct knowledge, but George wagered the craft was taken to Los Alamos. After the event, George noticed a tremendous amount of equipment at the then Atomic Energy Commission lab, including flatbed and low-boy trucks. Interesting here, George also claimed to see photos of the craft. As of course did Scully's wife, and as we know, elements of the U.S. DOD and IC were interested in intercepting such images. Possibly paramount to our entire investigation, Ramsay asked George if the Air Force was upset with Scully, who wrote the first book on Aztec, and a bestseller at that. If George's account is true, this tremendously strengthens the argument Newton and Gabbower were put through grueling trial as punishment for leaking the story. Tangential to our story today, but just as Aztec was born from Scully's behind the flying saucers, so too did the book give rise to the testimony of one of the most critically overlooked characters in all of UFO lore, Dr. Robert Sarbacher. In 1950, Canadian government senior radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith wrote to the Controller of Telecommunications in the Department of Transport requesting for Canada to begin its first official investigation into UFOs, specifically studying complex magnetism as a form of propulsion. This document was never supposed to be public. The classification of this document was likely accidentally downgraded. The document was classified top secret until 15 September 1969 and remained largely hidden until UFO researchers Arthur Bray and Stanton Friedman obtained a copy in 1978. In this letter, Smith made three astounding claims told to him by a source within Washington regarding UFOs. 1. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States government, higher even than the H-bomb. 2. Flying saucers exist. 3. Their modus operandi is unknown, but concentrated efforts are being made by a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. 4. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance. Wilbert Smith, a man whom Silas Newton shared a tremendous amount of respect for, would go on to spearhead Canada's first two UFO programs, Projects Magnet and Second Story. 3. Smith was possibly even exposed to technologies of unknown origin by U.S. government officials, but of course, that is not our story today. The source of Wilbert B. Smith for this profound memo, 1. Dr. Robert Sarbacher. Sarbacher served as a respected physicist and consultant to Vannevar Bush's and the DoD's Research and Development Board in the 1950s under the Truman administration. The esteemed Harvard graduate and student of Einstein served as the founder and dean of Georgia Institute of Technology, director of research at WED Labs, scientific consultant to the U.S. Marines and as mentioned earlier, involved in the Joint Research and Development Board. Sarbacher's research specialized in remote-controlled rockets, though curiously, Sarbacher has largely been wiped from the annals of history similar to Dr. Eric Henry Wang. On 15 September 1950, Wilbert Smith interviewed Robert Sarbacher. Smith stated he had read Scullies behind the flying saucers and wished to know how much of the book was fact, to which Sarbacher replied, quote, the facts reported in the book are substantially correct, end quote. The two would discuss magnetic propulsion systems behind UFOs before Smith's source would inform Smith of the shocking points made in the 1950 memo. Beginning his research on Aztec after being struck by behind-the-flying saucers, William Steinman quickly attempted to track down Robert Sarbacher. The accomplished physicist stated he himself had no association with any of the people involved with UFO crash recoveries and had no specifics on dates of successful recoveries. However, Sarbacher had been invited to participate in several discussions regarding recoveries whilst consulting with the R&amp;D board but was never given access to personally attend. Sarbacher still did attest meetings regarding UFO crash retrievals were held by the Military Research and Development Board at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and involved figures such as John von Neumann, Vannevar Bush, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, three key U.S. scientists and three figures linked to the Aztec crash. Though he did not receive materials or photographs, Sarbacher had been privy to UFO crash reports during his official Pentagon duties. In the direct words of Sarbacher, quote, About the only thing I remember at this time is that certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories analyzed them very carefully. There were reports that instruments or people operating these machines were also very lightweight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and acceleration associated with their machinery. I remember in talking with some of the people at the office that I got the impression these quote unquote aliens were constructed like certain insects we've observed on earth, wherein because of the low mass the inertial forces involved in operation of these instruments would be quite low. I still do not know why the higher order of classification has been given and why the denial of the existence of these devices, end quote. Obviously, Sarbacher's described lightweight materials closely resemble the metals described from the Roswell and Aztec wreckage. And we do, of course, have a possible paper trail of custody here. As in my video on Battelle Memorial Institute, I discussed the contractor receiving pieces of the Roswell wreckage to test on the now coveted material used in many industries such as aerospace and medical, night and all. However, Sarbacher's description of biologics do somewhat differ here. Certainly, the biologics described in Aztec and Roswell sound far more humanoid than insect, but this could attest to the likelihood multiple non-human species have visited and crashed on the planet. As we continue, I would strongly suggest reading the book by Grant Cameron, UFOs Area 51 and Government Informants. On a future unknown date, Steinman would write to UFO researcher Grant Cameron. The letter would discuss friend of Cameron and Steinman, the legendary Stanton Freedman, had also tracked down Sarbacher in 1983. According to Sarbacher, quote, I did not attend the meetings at right field concerning the recovered saucers, but there was one person who attended all of the meetings. I can't remember his name. He wrote a book on electrical engineering, was a member of the RDB, and was the head of the electrical engineering department at a university in Pennsylvania, end quote. Based on this statement, Steinman did some digging on his own volition and derived a name. Steinman received direct confirmation of this name, another one of the most under discussed names in all of UFO lore and usual of this channel, one Dr. Eric A. Walker. I'm sure he needs no introduction here, but let's alongside Sarbacher discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker. The genius that was Dr. Walker was born in 1910. He received his BS in engineering in 1932, MBA in 1933, and his DSC in 35, all from Harvard University. In his early professional years, Walker would teach mathematics and electrical engineering at Tufts College. Walker would then join the University of Connecticut, where he taught electrical engineering and initiated courses for a special war training program. It is widely thought that here is where Walker met Dr. Vannevar Bush and likely became initiated into UFO programs. During the Second World War, the doctor would join the Underwater Sound Laboratory at Harvard University, where he would quickly find himself in charge of ordinance, specifically weapons. The accomplished scientist studies in Underwater Sound Lab led to the creation of the homing torpedo, which shall Walker be awarded with the Naval Ordinance Development Award and a Presidential Certificate of Merit. By 1944, Walker would join Vannevar Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development, and by 45, Walker would join Penn State University, which he would later become president of. It was at Penn State, at the behest of the Navy, Walker would create the Applied Research Laboratory, now a DOD-designated U.S. Navy UARC, or University-affiliated Research Center. Now, I talk in extreme detail in most of my projects about UARCs and their semi-private corporate counterparts, FFRDCs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. Involvement in UFO legacy program operations, so, reference any of these projects for more on that topic. Recall how Sarbacher set in 1950, as consultant to the Defense Research Board, UFO crash retrieval meetings were held at Wright Patterson by the R&amp;D Board spearheaded by Vannevar Bush. While in that same year of 1950, Walker sat on the R&amp;D Board and would later go on to serve as its executive secretary from 1950 to 1952. Indeed, Stanton Friedman's Sharp Eye uncovered an early 1950s document from the Department of the Army to chairman of the U.S. Communications Intelligence Board, USCIB. The subject of this document is, quote, indoctrination for special intelligence for Mr. Eric Arthur Walker, end quote. Walker would go on to assist in many DOD and IC projects, including Project Azorian in 1972, to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K-129 at the behest of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office. Now this is interesting, as I have directly connected the vessel used, the Glomar Explorer, and the highly secretive Nuro to undersea UFO crash retrieval operations, and I highly recommend viewing that project. Throughout the 1980s, the name Dr. Eric A. Walker was kept secret by select UFO investigators, such as Stanton Friedman and William Steinman, in hopes the doctor could be convinced to publicly disclose his involvement in UFO crash retrievals and material exploitation programs. William Steinman first reached out to Dr. Walker on 19 March 1948. Walker's response was bizarre, to say the least. Dr. Walker typed on the lower portion of Steinman's sent letter, and the doctor even cut off Steinman's return address and stamped it on the front of his envelope, the correspondence read in all caps, quote, Stop. Don't try and find me. I came on that machine, I will leave May 15, ergo, quiet, quiet, quiet, end quote. Steinman would attempt to contact Walker again on 31 May 1984, with no response. But on 30 August 1987, the ever-persistent Steinman would call Walker, and to his surprise, Walker answered. Straight to the punch, Steinman told Walker he wished to speak on meetings at Wright Patterson in 49-50, concerning military recoveries of flying saucers and their occupants. Just as shocking as Walker even answering the call, he would state, quote, Yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter. Why do you want to know about that? End quote. In this 1987 conversation, Walker would reveal he knew of the Majestic 12, in fact, he had for 40 years, so all the way back to 1947. Then gave Steinman a bizarre reference to Don Quixote, quote, I believe that you're chasing after windmills and fighting with windmills. Walker told Steinman the researchers' efforts were futile, but still the doctor would see if he could wrangle up any of the 1950 Wright Patterson notes. But to this day, I have heard nothing of these notes making their way to the public. Now, I know I'm spending a significant amount of time on Walker and Sarbacher, but the fact behind the flying saucers containing the Aztec story led to the discovery of two of the most critical and understudied individuals in the subject is paramount to our investigation. Several UFO researchers would approach Walker in the late 1980s, but few were able to speak with him. In conversations with Henry Azad de Hel, aka Armin Victorian, Walker would reveal he was present for the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash retrieval, an all-time favorite case of mine. Walker would tell Victorian, quote, Only a couple people are capable of handling this issue. Unless your mind ability is like Einstein's or likewise, I do not think you can achieve anything, end quote. Walker would even bring up ESP, extra sensory perception, stating, quote, How good is your sixth sense? How much do you know about ESP, unless you know about it and how to use it? You would not be taken in. Only a few know about it, end quote. Believe it or not, we could spend another two hours here on Walker and cover perplexing coded letters returned to Steinman, 1988 conversations with T. Scott Crane stating Walker would no longer speak on UFOs and much more. What secrets could Walker have possibly held onto regarding Aztec? My wager many as Walker joined the DRB one year following the incident, 1949. Integral to Steinman's 1986 reconstruction of the Aztec retrieval is the interplanetary phenomenon unit, or IPU, as we will call it from here on out. I have discussed the IPU many times before, including speaking on the documents with Ryan Wood, who has served alongside his late father, Dr. Robert Wood, as the premier researchers attempting to authenticate or disprove the majestic 12 documents. Since the IPU is so integral to piecing together the retrieval, let's spend some time reviewing the infamous interplanetary phenomenon unit. Now frustratingly, Steinman never presented strong evidence for why IPU, stationed out of Camp Hale, Colorado, was the on-site military team securing the craft and crash LZ, only reporting the word from sources. Steinman was, however, one of the trailblazing researchers to prove the IPU's existence. Like just about everything related to Majestic 12, or UFO crash retrievals, IPU is not without controversy. Researchers such as Brad Sparks and Kevin Randall have professed quote-unquote truth about the IPU, claiming this unit was no more than the input-processing unit of Army Intelligence's later Army AFSTC, Foreign Science and Technology Center. Basically, IPU was the incoming document's mailroom for Army S&amp;T post-Sputnik in the 1968 Space Era. Sparks claims the IP moniker has been misrepresented as interplanetary phenomenon because the real unit to him did handle the receipt and forwarding of UFO reports. FOIA documents we will discuss have labeled the IPU as existing through quote-unquote institutional memory. Sparks believe this is because Army FOIA officers have simply misremembered around the IPU. Now, I find great fault in this reporting and very little research of substance, but now that we have addressed the IPU counterpoints, let's begin to dive in. We will primarily address the work of Robert and Ryan Wood, as well as UFO researcher Anthony Bergalea here. Please check out their respective sites, MajesticDocuments.com and UFOExplorations.com. In 1980, the late Richard Hall, Associate of Mufon and NiCAP, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the U.S. Army, requesting information concerning Army Intelligence records relating to UFOs. It is unknown and debated if Hall actually said the words interplanetary phenomenon unit in his FOIA letter. Hall was advised by Colonel William Guild, Director of Army Counterintelligence, that quote, please be advised that the interplanetary phenomenon unit of the Scientific and Technical Branch Counterintelligence Directorate was disestablished in the late 1950s and never reactivated. All records pertaining to this unit were surrendered to the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations with Operation Blue Book, end quote. Fast forwarding to 1984, we find Steinman conducting similar FOIAs for IPU. Steinman was additionally told the IPU was disestablished and all records were transferred to USAF in the late 1950s. According to Lieutenant Colonel Lance Cornyn, the IPU was formed as an in-house project as an interest item for an Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. The IPU was never a unit or formally recognized mission or authority, only through institutional memory did the Army CIC have any recollection of the IPU. Let's fast forward again to 1987 to above top secret author Timothy Good, who filed similar FOIAs. Good was given the exact same spiel as Steinman and Hall. Good was given the same spiel as Steinman and Hall. So, what can we learn from these FOIAs? A. The Army confirmed with the Army Department of Counterintelligence there was in fact an interplanetary phenomenon unit or IPU. B. The IPU was disestablished in the late 1950s. C. The IPU records were quote-unquote surrender to the Air Force in conjunction with Project Blue Book. D. The unit was a quote-unquote in-house project as an interest item for an unnamed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. E. The unit lacked formal function, mission, or authority. F. It is only through quote-unquote institutional memory that the Army knows of the IPU's existence. If IPU records were given over to Project Blue Book, why are there no records of IPU in Blue Book's many reports? With the Army's response, it is clear there is recollection of IPU, but the Army CIC is not forthcoming about information or records. Years later, Kufon, or the computer UFO network, received a reply from AFOSI that IPU material had been destroyed, but offered no further information. This contradicts Army reports the IPU maintained no records. Some further intriguing breadcrumbs have been reported by Anthony Burgalia. The Defense Central Index of Investigations, DCII, is a DOD Automated Control Index that identifies and reports on investigations conducted by all DOD investigative agencies. Essentially, this served as the most complex and comprehensive acknowledged military and intelligence data center in existence. In the early 1980s, researcher John Frick became aware of DCII computer printouts made under the command of the legendary general Douglas MacArthur that related to UFO sightings and investigations. The first line of the short quote, I have not seen this printout reproduced, but if real, fully destroys the IPU counterargument proposed by Brad Sparks. Frick even stated some of his sources, such as the former AFOSI agent Rudolph M. Schelmar, revealed that MacArthur's IPU files were indeed transferred in 1962 to AFOSI. Perhaps IPU really did operate under MacArthur. After all, the general would discuss quote unquote interplanetary war in 1955 and 1962 addresses. Remember here, Army FOIA stated IPU was an interest item for a joint chief of staff for intelligence, aka a G2. MacArthur's G2 was Colonel Charles A. Willoughby, who later became chief of MacArthur's intelligence staff. Willoughby also retired as a major general. Brigalia reported Willoughby was even equated with the legendary Philip J. Corso. However, researchers such as Timothy Good suggest the IPU did not operate directly under MacArthur, but by someone from even higher rank, MacArthur's immediate superior, General George C. Marshall, Army chief of staff and later US Secretary of Defense. George C. Marshall is additionally considered by the woods as the origin for the IPU and remember William Steinman reported Marshall himself mobilized the IPU for the Aztec retrieval. Now let's move into discussing the IPU as it appears throughout the majestic documents. I'm going to skip over Thomas Cantwell, the enigmatic self-proclaimed IPU member who gave several majestic document drops to Timothy Cooper. So if you want to learn more about him, go watch my Majestic Documents investigation with Ryan Wood. If you are wondering why I am mentioning majestic documents at all, I additionally recommend watching that same piece. Within the majestic documents are two files alleged to be records from the IPU themselves. The interplanetary phenomenon unit field order dated July 1947, given to Tim Cooper by Cantwell via UPS between 1993 and 1996, as well as the IPU report dated July 1947, given to Cooper from Cantwell personally in July of 1995. Now the quote-unquote leak dates of these IPU documents should put to bed any theory Steinman took the IPU reports at face value and constructed his Aztec case around the two documents. Outside of the two alleged internal IPU documents, there are several majestic documents that mention the IPU. These include a 5 March 1942 memo from George Marshall to President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussing the recovery of an unidentified airplane following the infamous 1942 Battle of Los Angeles. Marshall says in this disputed document, the craft was likely of interplanetary origin and suggested a special intelligence unit be created for further investigation of the phenomenon. But let's start here with the short IPU field order dated July 4, 1947 and marked top secret. The one page memo directs a commanding officer to take a counterintelligence team to a UFO crash site and report to the G2 at Conrant Field, New Mexico, which is of course Roswell. The commanding officer was to take a non-commission OIC, an aeronautical engineer, a scientist, a security officer, and a medical doctor and to provide a report by the 28th of July. The IPU report, dated July 22, 1947, gives us far more to work with and let's break this down a little bit as I have connected this document to various crash retrievals in the past. The intelligence assessment references recovery of multiple fallen objects from 4 to 6 July 1947. This possibly lends credence to Roswell featuring multiple UFO crash retrievals. Now the document was prepared by the Army IPU, Scientific and Technical Branch, Counterintelligence Directorate at the behest of G2, the exact same descriptors of IPU given to 1980s researchers from FOIA. But to play devil's advocate, this document released in 1995. So if it is a hoax, the authors of the hoax could have easily copied known IPU details from researchers such as Steinman and Hall. What interests me here though is mention of a special radiobiological team accompanied by an SED and security detail from Sandian National Labs under orders from Colonel Hasbrook. Armed forces special weapons project being ordered to secure the immediate area surrounding the Roswell crash site. Select scientists from the Atomic Energy Commission were amongst this team, including Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, an accused member of the Aztec crash by Steinman a little less than one decade earlier. But that's not all. The IPU also stated Dr. Detlev Bronk was in charge of biologic autopsies just as in the Aztec case. The document states President Truman would be given a limited briefing on the incident by General Hoyt Vandenberg, but that General Eisenhower, later president, would actually be shown the recovery of the wreckage. According to majestic documents lore, the 1952 Eisenhower briefing document disclosed details of Roswell to Eisenhower. If he had already been briefed by the IPU, why the double briefing? Well, this could be explained as the illustrious MJ-12 was established according to the Eisenhower briefing document later in September 1947, so the double briefing makes sense. The ties between Aztec, Roswell, and Maj. 12 are indeed intriguing as the IPU report states George Marshall was the only cabinet member to date to know about crashed UFOs, but that Secretary of Defense James Forstall would be briefed on certain aspects. In Maj. 12 lore, Truman and Forstall engaged in September 1947 meetings to establish the Majestic-12. To learn more about Forstall and his untimely demise, I also again recommend watching my Maj. 12 video. Just as in the Aztec case, recovered craft were stored at Los Alamos and access was gate kept by one Lieutenant General Collins. Now addressing point nine in the document here, I have connected this to the 1974 Koyama Mexico UFO crash retrieval, a fascinating and scintillating case. According to the document, Sandia Personnel suffered some sort of form of non-human containment breach, possibly hazardous liquids or gas, and three technicians were killed. Ultimately here, the study of the IPU does not lead us to any hard conclusions. The illustrious unit exists, but its memories and records have been destroyed. I do find it utterly fascinating the sources of Steinman informed him, Marshall, and the IPU helmed the Aztec recovery many years before the quote unquote leaks of these documents. And although these Maj. 12 IPU documents released years after Steinman's research are rightly disputed and we cannot lean on them for any definitive statements, they paint striking parallels between the Roswell crash and Aztec crash just eight months later. Like any good crash retrieval case before his passing, the legendary Leonard Stringfield wrote about, connected with sources, and reported on Aztec. Viewers of my channel will absolutely recognize I often celebrate Stringfield and his UFO crash retrieval status reports one through seven as the best work on UFO crash retrieval operations period. Stringfield was approached by Steinman in 1985 to write the foreword for the 1986 epic that is the ultra rare UFO crash at Aztec a well kept secret. In his foreword, Stringfield wrote he was incredibly hesitant to re-engage with the case. Stringfield admitted he too had been conditioned that the case was nothing more than a hoax, schemed by Silas Newton and his dubious partner in crime, Leo Gabauer. Stringfield stated he was equally initially swindled by debunks presented by William or Bill Moore at a Mouffon symposium in 1985. Moore would around 1989 admit he was working with the US intelligence community to sow disinformation into the subject of UFOs. Steinman's convictions and thoroughness led to Stringfield re-engaging with the case, but what history did he have with Aztec? Let's travel back to 1974 when Aztec had long been labeled a hoax due to the sketchy reporting of JP Kahn. One John Spencer Carr, a retired South Florida professor of mass communications at the University of South Florida Tampa, went public with what he professed to be new information regarding the Aztec incident in October of 1974. Fortunately, Steinman obtained clippings of Carr's testimony in an October 1974 Clearwater Sun issue. Carr stated he had in his possession what he deemed to be credible information regarding Aztec, disclosed to him by five sources including a senior USAF official involved in the retrieval. Carr claimed the craft and bodies of Aztec were flown to Edwards Air Force Base and ultimately taken to Wright Patterson. Two locations I do strongly suspect are engaged in UFO legacy program operations, but almost as soon as it was resurrected, Aztec was once again demolished shortly after in 1975 in an article in official UFO by Mike McKellen titled the UFO crash of 1948 is a hoax. Admittedly, Carr did seemingly report many of the Aztec details incorrectly or was confusing Aztec with another case, claiming a crash date of 12 February 48, claiming military men approached a 30 foot saucer with guns drawn and the presence of 12 non-human bodies dead from decompression. In the interest of time, we will not cover Carr's claims in McKellen's debunk as we did Newton and Kahn, but where does Stringfield fit in here? Carr and Stringfield would speak extensively after Carr went public in 1974, but Carr would never reveal his sources. On 6 February 1982, Carr, fearing his own mortality, would disclose the name of his Air Force source to Stringfield in Leonard's own words, quote. When Professor Carr named his source, I sat back dumbfounded. I knew his name well in research and recalled some of the source's comments on UFOs while he served as an Air Force officer. But Carr was quick to tie a string to his disclosure, stating please Len, keep the name to yourself, please spare me any trouble as long as I live, end quote. Carr and ultimately Steinman would reignite Stringfield's waning interest in Aztec and by 1989 in UFO crash retrieval status report five, Stringfield was writing again about Aztec and mentioning the case in the same sentences as Roswell and Kingman, two crashes I and many others place extreme confidence in. In 1991 status report six, Stringfield would discuss and reproduce a fascinating new witness to the Aztec case. Stringfield was given permission to reproduce the report on the crash at Farmington, written in 1991 by Chuck Oldham. Oldham had in 1990 come in contact with an Aztec informant, a former alleged military officer with high security clearances. And together, the two published the witness's disclosures, as well as diagrams and images of the craft and biologics. The witness described accessing classified files, discussing crashed alien craft in their occupants. Within the files, the witness stumbled upon what was an image of a perfectly intact circular shaped craft, lying tilted five to 10 degrees on one side on the ground in the desert. The craft was metallic, appearing similar to brushed aluminum. There did not appear to be a crater or ground surface disturbance caused by the impact. The report referenced to the image and craft in great detail. The witness claimed the report listed the craft was retrieved near the town of Farmington, New Mexico, just south of Aztec prior to 1950. The report stated, but the witness was unable to confirm in the photographs that the dome part of the saucer featured porthole type features, though they were not made of any glass. Just like the Aztec story goes, one porthole had a puncture, the diameter of a pencil. The report listed the retrieval team tried diamond drills, acetylene torches, and more on the porthole, but nothing was able to damage the craft and porthole. This reminds me closely of the 1963 RB case I covered in UFO whistleblowers volume two. And just like the rest of our Aztec testimonies, an accidental fiddling of the damaged porthole led to the craft opening. One point here, though, is at odds with the rest of our Aztec discussion. The witness claimed the craft was 30-something feet in diameter. The beams inside, according to Oldham Source, were four foot tall humanoids, badly charred, wearing a strong woven fabric flight suit. The report author concludes the craft likely operated on magnetic or gravitational fields to travel great distances in a minuscule amount of time. Not so sure about the Aztec case. Since that time, there have been multiple individuals that I respect quite a bit who have talked about this case and said there's a little more than meets the eye than the JP Kahn debunk. Of course, with Ross Goldhardt on Jesse Michael saying, Nat Kobitz directly or strongly inferred or directly told him that the Aztec case was real, I thought, well, now might be the time to dive in and give this case a fair shake as possible. If you're like me and arrive at similar conclusions, I do wager that this case likely happened and I do wager it's a very complicated case. Similar to Roswell, we might be confusing details of multiple cases. With the UFO report, the crash at Farmington and some other witness testimony, specifically Professor Carr, multiple individuals talk about a 30-plus foot saucer crashing and not a 99.9 diameter disc. Maybe there's some details getting confused here, but believe it or not, and I know I say this in every video, I think this project really only scratches the surface of Aztec. Remember how much time we devoted to IPU? Well, as it turns out, there's even more majestic documents. I don't know if you can see it on the camera right here that involve Aztec. Now, why did I not include this right here? This 45-page, I think it's a DIA majestic document that Ryan and Robert Wood have not even discussed very long. Well, this is because this document drop came out in 2017 through a radio show host from a trusted source. I can't remember the woman's name right now. I believe it's her first name, Heather. But I would like to get in contact with her to find out who this trusted source is. Of course, a majestic documents drop in 2017 is decades beyond when the majority of documents drop between 1984 and 1996, let's say. So I'm quite intrigued why this specific set of documents was leaked in 2017, a very critical date in UFO lore. But the reason I didn't speak about this is because this document says some pretty bizarre things, pretty outlandish things specifically about Nikola Tesla. It reads almost like a novel. It's a really good read, which is kind of why I take apprehension here. But also because this majestic document, again, I'll put it right up here and I'll put the link in the video description, pretty much tells the Aztec case verbatim in the same style of story as Steinman. So it talks about IPU. It talks about all the recovery methods Steinman talks about. So one of my preliminary theories here is that this document drop, of course, as soon as a ton of interest starts back up in UFOs around 2017, quite possibly this document drop was meant to muddy the water surrounding the Aztec case. And maybe by recovering Steinman's account of the case that it just means, hey, Steinman could have ripped this off a random majestic document that existed way back in the day. So that's why I didn't include this. And speaking of Steinman and majestic documents, you know, the IPU report and field order dropped in 1995 in 1996, I believe are the dates off the top of my head. Now, one of the things I grappled with back and forth is, did Steinman have a previous experience with these documents? And he constructed his Aztec case based upon the IPU report specifically, because as we know, General George Marshall, others, the IPU, the Sandia, Los Alamos are mentioned within that document. But I, and perhaps there could be creams here, because the same thing with Dr. Eric Walker, Steinman did keep his name secret for quite a few years and hope that, you know, Walker would speak out, perhaps there's a world in which that majestic document was released to some researchers back in the 80s, the IPU reports. And it was kept a little secret until Thomas Cantwheel gave the documents to Timothy Cooper back in 1996, I believe the IPU report was. But I digress, there's nothing to substantiate that theories, but it is interesting nonetheless. And again, this ultra top secret majestic report from the DIA comes out in 2017, telling the Steinman account of Aztec verbatim. So, I'm not quite sure what to do with this document. Perhaps I'll make a majestic documents follow up part two where we can analyze some of the more controversial documents, project Aquarius, maybe this document and some others. So maybe we'll do that in the future. But I'd like to know what you guys think about this video. I mean, I'll tell you what right now. I don't think I've ever said the word doodle bug so much in my life. It was pretty tough recording the script, trying to talk about magnetic anomaly detection devices and Carl Highland and RSI. I mean, geospatial services, Inc. GSI, my apologies, and try and say doodle bug with a straight face. But when I found Texas Instrument in 1980, their 30 year history is saying, Hey, we pay respects to our doodle buggers back in the day. I got a little bit more relaxed about saying such things. So I know in this video, there was a lot of information discussed. And you know, if you're going to purchase one book or pursue one lead after this, I can't recommend enough buying the Ramses book that I have right here. The book is it is fantastic. It is exactly how I like to do research. All sources are always cited. There's a massive reference tab. There's numerous pictures. I mean, there's stuff I didn't even speak about in this video, such as the Ramses hiring, you know, various professionals who weren't even into UFOs to reconstruct how the Hart Canyon roads could have been used to transport the huge disk to Los Alamos. So a ton more groundwork in that book. And, you know, I barely even scratched the surface with it. And of course, we got the big boy here. This step certainly put a dent in my pocket. It's a pretty expensive book. But if I was going to do a video on Aztec, I needed the book. There's so much awesome artwork and some truly astonishing things written by Steinman here. I expressed it multiple times in the video, but I do have frustration. Steinman so cavalierly discusses, as fact, hey, the IPU retrieved the disk, General George Marshall got the call, you know, Highlands, sorry, Oppenheimer, Vannevar Bush, they were all there at the site, especially Chirur and Dr. Detlef Bronck, but doesn't give any, you know, references to his sources or even corroborating evidence. So although he has a ton of exhibits throughout the book, and these include scanned documents, JP Kahn's debunk, Mike McKellen's debunk, Robert Carr's testimony, he does lack there. So that is my biggest critique of the book. But I do think it's excellent, especially the work on Dr. Eric Henry Wang. That is a thread that continues to persist to my research today. Who was Wang? Why can I find nothing about him besides the odd civil engineering atribune to him as he's passed and solely his mention in Operation Upshot Knot Hole, which of course, Arthur Stanzel claimed he worked under Dr. Eric Henry Wang for the Kingman incident and that Dr. Wang spearheaded the reverse engineering and retrieval efforts for that. So the parallels between Aztec, Roswell, and Kingman, I know I said in the video, are endless. These cases seem to be handled and executed the recoveries in an extremely similar manner. You can kind of tell with the Aztec case what's interesting to me is different methods and approaches after the folly that was Roswell. And that included when that knucklehead Silas Newton started talking about the event. Did Carl Highland discuss to Leo Cabauer and Silas Newton? Was he the informant of Aztec? Maybe. I know that Steinman really presses this and I really applaud his theory there. But if we could just have tangible evidence that under Highland's company, Leo Cabauer worked there or Cabauer and Highland worked together in Antarctica in the 30s, like Steinman said, the thesis would be so much stronger. I mean, even if we had evidence that Cabauer worked for Dr. Paul Scherer in the kind of cryogenic containment units meant to freeze the biologics, we'd have so much more to chew on there. And let me know what you think about the court case as well. I've never covered court proceedings before, but I found it pretty interesting, especially Dr. James Meredith of Colorado School of Mines, who was indeed in the same department as Highland, testifying that the Doodle Bug could not find oil, let alone a submarine, and he analyzed war surplus store parts that was quote unquote very similar to the Doodle Bug purchased for $4.45. We also proved whether it's the work of GSI, even patents from Vannevar Bush and other patents that magnetic anomaly detection devices or reflective seismograph technology, both of these, for the sole purpose of finding oil was extensively utilized pre-World War II. And then in World War II, many of the corporations or many of the brightest minds that are working on reflective seismology or MADs to detect oil are brought in by Vannevar Bush to the OSRD to make submarine detecting equipment. So that is relayed by Scully in the 50s for the secret war projects. That is some very tangible stuff to work with. What else do we have that's tangible to work with? We have the Sting operation in 50 from CID and FBI. That is interesting. We have discussions of J. Edgar Hoover messaging about Silas Newton. Now, I don't blame individuals for at the beginning of this video if they made it all through the end first saying, Gerb, why are you covering Aztec? It was proven a hoax. I was victim of this as well. As I said at the beginning of this rant, so was Leonard Stringfield. And I love that in the forward to William Steinman's book Leonard Stringfield said, I was taken by the work of J. Pecan and Bill Moore. Bill Moore, of course, we showed him on the move on Symposium in 89 saying he was working with intelligence agencies. Perhaps Bill Moore, you know, there's some theories floating around that Bill Moore and Richard Doty made some majestic documents. Maybe they had a hand in this puppy right here. But let's discuss Aztec Moore. I say this again, this is just to kickstart research into this case. And I want to know what everybody thinks. And, you know, before we log off for the day, a couple of action items. I was just out of town for a to go on a show. And there I got to meet an individual who's making a documentary. I got a signed poster here from Mr. Luigi. I think it's Vendett Tilley, right? For Project Gravitar. You know, I had been interested in this case in this documentary since I met Chris Ramsey back at the November hearings. And he was telling me all about, hey, you know, I've been talking to Luigi, I've been paying attention to Gravitar, and there's going to be a lot they're talking about Bob Lazar in this new documentary. If you know anything about me, you'll know I've been infatuated with the story of Bob since I was a wee youngster. But I tend not to talk about Bob because I am so biased towards him. And I will always acknowledge that more than anything, I want to believe Bob Lazar. So I tend to not be able to critically analyze pro or con statements with Bob. So I tend to keep him out. But I got to see some stuff with Project Gravitar. And guys, please be excited. This is awesome. This is exactly what I wanted from the Jeremy Corbell documentary. Luigi said to me, you know, maybe I'm putting too much information in. And guys, if you're watching this channel and made it here, we like too much information. So Project Gravitar is very strict on reducing drama, following leads, especially names, full names. You know, you might have heard some names associated with Bob's case, but we're talking full names and identified individuals. And the photorealistic recreated S4 is something to behold. That is wicked, wicked, wicked cool. So yeah, if you see my wall, you already see the sports model drawn by Bob and the propulsion system by Bob. Now I'm going to have this signed Project Gravitar poster by Bob. So it's turned into a bit of a Volkanovski and Bob shrine. If anybody has some awesome artwork they would like to send in, please let me know. And I'll give you kind of like a PO box or a shipping address because I would love to hang up some diagrams, some really cool art on the wall. So please get in contact with me, uapgurb at gmail.com or uapgurb at protonmail.com. And let's get that started because I want to feature some more artwork. Channel wise, I got some huge stuff coming up for the channel that I'm pretty excited about. You know, a lot of huge projects like this. It seems like every project I make these days, I can't really get it under an hour and 45 minutes. So we'll just keep rolling with that. I got some good ideas in the tank and some good stuff coming up outside of the channel too and stuff around the channel. So please keep up with that. Remember guys, I do have a Patreon, I'd love if you went and subscribed and gave me money every month. I don't gatekeep content, so there's no restricted content on there. Or I'll probably start up YouTube memberships as well. So feel free to give me money every month there. I don't gatekeep content. So only give what you think the channel is worth. But if you're not going to do that, totally fine, please at least like and subscribe the video, give me a comment what you think. I am just thrilled that everybody is here watching and I'm incredibly blessed to have people watching the videos, making it all the way through. So thank you so much. And again, let me know what you thought about the Aztec case. This is just the beginning of me talking about it. So with that being said, remember to like and subscribe. Let me know what you think and I will see everybody on the next show. Thank you so much.

In 1950, Canadian Senior Engineer Wilburt B. Smith Kicked off Canada's first official investigations into UFOs based on 4 key points a source in Washington, Sarbacher Relayed to him. These points stated that the study of very real UFOs was classified even higher than the H Bomb within the USG and that a small group studied the phenomenon spearheaded by Dr. Vannevar Bush.</p> <p>A look into Sarbacher leads to MANY bizarre roads including attempts to track UAP with German V-2 rockets, connections to MJ-12, a possibility of Oppenheimer being involved in UFO study, and the first meetings of UFO crash retrievals occurring in 1949/1950.</p> <p>Sarbacher mentions one member who attended this meeting, former Penn State President Eric A. Walker. Walker confirmed himself he attended the meeting and warned various researchers to pursue the phenomenon. Walker also made incredibly interesting remarks on the Majestic-12 AND stated himself he observed the alleged 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO Crash. </p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:44 Doctor Sarbacher 3:07 Germna V-2 Rocket 4:58 Wilbert B.

While Castle and his fellow VMA-513 Marines were performing overnight AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval duties, the men were sent to investigate \"unidentified flare activity\".</p> <p>When rounding a hill near Emerson Dry Lake, the marines encountered an enormous, 200-300 foot, equilateral black triangular craft hovering only 150-200 feet off the ground.

Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7pm to 7am. And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee, probably in chairs or hanging out in the back. We get a call on the radio that there's, you know, either unexplained or unauthorized something about flare activity in the desert. You know, maybe four, three to four miles out, maybe five. We come over a hill, we're yanking the trailer behind us, you know, maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour. We come over a hill and all five of us see it. It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle, meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner. And possibly some kind of venting on the sides, but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy. That was there hanging in the sky. I say hanging because there was enough wind for something even, you know, I know aerodynamics, something that if it was thin enough, maybe it could hover slightly. So this is what it would look like if you were looking straight up at it. Of course, that's not the angle, it was more, you know, I don't want to use that. A soup bowl going forward with no light emitting from here, yellow, yellowish, whiteish, or kind of like a ball sphere had been embedded into the underside. Accompanying it, we're about 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms and five to six can't remember exactly vehicles. Look like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks jacked up all black, all matte, some with canopies, some with antennas. This is all coming in a flash, right? Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill. The minute we came up over about half of them, maybe 15 came running up the hill towards us, V-formations with guns. Yeah, right up harsh language. Get your fing heads down, get your fing heads down. Get your fing heads down. You know, not shooting. But looking like they're ready to. You know, very close to our heads as if they didn't want us to look at anything. We felt, my initial reaction was we fed up, found something that we shouldn't be involved in and I'm just going to comply because I'm scared. On this channel, I investigate UFO whistleblowers, UFO crash retrieval cases, and UFO legacy program operations that exist somewhere between elements of the United States Department of Defense, intelligence communities, colossal defense contractors, and semi-private R&amp;D experts called Federally-funded research and development centers. One of my personal favorite topics to study is the concept of alien reproduction vehicles. Human-made aerospace vehicles that range from replicas of non-human craft to prosaic airframes and designs employing one or more aspects of non-human technologies. The term ARV was coined by the now infamous Brad S, an industrial designer who witnessed three man-made flying saucer vehicles called quote-unquote flux liners at a classified section of the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, which were described as copycat vehicles employing highly exotic propulsion systems and craft designs, while still featuring F-4 Phantom jump seats and sloped-on paint. As recently as 2024, whistleblower Matthew Brown proposed the Immaculate Constellation Reports, which detailed a special access program targeted with performing data acquisition of video, satellite imagery, etc., on UFOs and quote-unquote reproduction vehicles. Such cases involved reproduction vehicles detailed as silent, enormous black triangles observed by U.S. Indo-Paccom, or U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. I have discussed numerous cases surrounding alien reproduction vehicles, including the ever-complex and awe-inspiring flux liner, the whistleblower testimony of Ed, who served as an electronics warfare detector at the Edwards 412 test wing, where he claimed he served as the mediary between scientists and test pilots of reverse-engineered UFO craft. And I have devoted an entire documentary to exploring man-made reproduction vehicle triangular craft. In this project in question, I argued why I believe many, perhaps not all, but many triangular UFO sightings are in fact man-made vehicles that harness exotic technologies and concepts. Specific craft covered were seemingly prototype iterations of triangles with varying features seen worldwide from the 1970s to 1990s. Crescendoing in the 1989 Belgian Triangle UFO wave, as well as the XF-131 Super Sentinel, which famously made its way onto the X-Files Season 1, Episode 1. This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out. Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map, is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped. Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs? No. Planes built using UFO technology. After forensic artist Bill McDonald drew the copycat vehicle in a Denny's in Antelope Valley in 1992. Based upon the first-hand testimony from four engineers, two from Lockheed out of the Hellendale radar cross-section plans and two from Northrop Grumman out of the Tejon radar cross-section plans. The most famous mention of reverse-engineered craft came from Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet, who detailed the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B. The pride of U.S. Aerospace, whose propulsion system was reverse-engineered by Sandia in Lawrence Livermore National Labs. Two federally funded research and development centers, whose pilots hailed from the U.S. Navy and Edwards 412 Test Wing, whose engineering was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne Ryan, and whose program was managed by three of six of the U.S. Big Six intelligence agencies, the NRO, NSA, and CIA. But today, I am thrilled to announce I have sat down with a first-hand UFO witness who since he first approached David Grush in early 2025 is dead set on swearing his testimony before Congress. A former U.S. Marine whose testimony ties into this entire long-winded intro as well as other whistleblower testimonies I have covered, specifically Ed from the Edwards 412 Test Wing and U.S. Marines Jonathan Waganth and Michael Herrera. Meet Roderick Castle III, a veteran and sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 to 1999, who now works with veterans suffering from PTSD. Castle served with the VMA-513, the Flying Nightmares, an AV-8B Harrier Squadron stationed out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona, leading a team of six to eight Marines in aviation ordinance while also training as a helicopter flight medic. I have recorded an entire interview with Castle detailing his harrowing experience of what I wager is a triangular ARV, an accompanying black operation's unacknowledged Special Mission Unit encountered a little too close for comfort here in the continental United States. Viewers of my channel know me and know who I am, so a week before the interview with Castle releases, we will today exhaustively explore his testimony in place the who, what, when, where, and why to his harrowing encounter. To some, Castle's testimony may seem simple and quite similar to that of Waganth and Herrera. While on duty, a Marine encounters an all-black team with advanced gear and weaponry, featuring no insignia or identification, there might be a craft-defying all-logic hovering motionless nearby seemingly operated by humans, but the Marine is forcibly detained, threatened, and met with reprisals. But to me, Castle's brief but powerful testimony offers us an unparalleled look into U.S. legacy program operations, how these UFO paramilitary groups operate alongside other blue, a.k.a. friendly assets, and a greater understanding that the U.S. does indeed employ triangular craft that can defy all logic for clandestine aerospace applications. So please look at this video as a part one of two, the investigation of Castle should not be viewed without the interview of Castle. With all that out of the way, let's dive in, but last thing here, I know some viewers of my work can get tripped up with so many uses of acronyms. So guys, today we are diving into military programs, so please expect a tremendous amount of acronyms. I will try to relist all acronyms used in the video description, so please reference there if you get tripped up, but with that out of the way, let's begin. Roderick John Castle III entered into service at the United States Marine Corps in 1994, and by his retirement, Castle earned the rank of Sergeant, or an E-5. Castle's primary MOS, or Military Occupational Specialty, was a 6531. Her aircraft ordinance technician, Castle served at the MAG-13, or Marine Aircraft Control Group 13, of the 3D MAW, or Third Marine Aircraft Wing, stationed at MCAS Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma, and yes, I know, we're already getting into the acronyms. Now real fast, I previously discussed Yuma Proving Ground, or US Army MRTFB, or Major Range and Test Facility Base in regards to UFO Legacy Program Operations. 23 US MRTFBs exist, 8 Army, 6 Navy, 7 Air Force, and 2 Defense Agency. These include Edwards 412 Test Wing, NAWC Patuxent River, and the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Command, Fort Wachuka, and the West Desert Test Center, and more. One of my prevailing and prominent theories regarding UFO Legacy Programs is the usage of these critical core MRTFBs for UFO research, development, tests, and evaluation. This includes everything from craft storage, accompanying deep underground military bases beneath MRTFBs, and utilization of restricted airspace for test flight of recovered or reverse engineered craft. MCAS, out of which CASEL operated, is not part of Yuma Proving Ground, therefore it is not part of the MRTFB. In fact, while CASEL's experience involved a coordinated US Marine Corps experiment, I wager the USMC is quite unlikely to run and operate UFO Legacy Program Operations, and keep this in mind as we progress in our investigation. While I can present ample testimony, evidence, files, and research that the US Army, Air Force, and Navy operate siloed UFO Legacy Programs in conjunction with the US Big Six Intelligence Agencies, I can find no such evidence even suggesting USMC engages with the UFO portfolio. CASEL served with the VMA-513, nicknamed the Flying Nightmares, a USMC attack squadron known for use of its AV-8B Harrier jets. And towards the tail end of its service trained as a helicopter flight medic. Harriers are fascinating pieces of technology. These intriguing craft are known as VTOL, Vertical Takeoff and Landing Jets, while the AV-8B Harriers are known as STOVL, Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing, meaning that Harriers require little to no runway to take off and can actually land vertically. And this means Harrier jets can stand still and hover in the air, thanks to their Rolls-Royce Pegasus engines equipped with four rotating nozzles that can direct engine thrust quite the sight for an attack jet. But I mention this due to CASEL's familiarity with both Harrier jets and helicopters. He was well accustomed to VTOL and STOVL technology, helicopter morphology, and Harrier standstill flight vectoring and dynamics. In 1997, CASEL would take part in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, a 12-day experiment that ran from the 2nd of May 1997 to 14 May 1997 in Southern California out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms. The Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment was at the time the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, which explored methods to increase the area of influence and combat effectiveness of Marine units by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques. The Hunter Warrior Experiment operated with three primary objectives. One, quote, The first objective area covers tactical operations on the dispersed, non-contiguous battlefield. How small units perform against a numerically superior force on a battlefield that has no front, flank, or rear areas, and is key component of this objective, end quote. Two, quote, The second area is command control communication computers and intelligence, and the single battle concept. Creating and using a shared digital communications network will be crucial in many different areas. Experiments in C4I examine the digital network in information sharing, end quote. And finally, three, quote, The third objective is enhancing fire support and improving targeting to dominate the broad dispersed battlefield of the future, effective and efficient use of all indirect fire is absolutely necessary, end quote. During Hunter Warrior's Advanced Warfighting Experiment's operations, and within Hunter Warrior's AO, or area of operations, is where CASEL's experience took place. Now, if you recall in 2023, Jeremy Corbell released a video of a supposed triangle UFO over 29 palms. Arguments persist to this day if the video depicts a craft or a group of flares, but that and 29 palms are not relevant to our investigation today. Indeed, I believe many studying CASEL's testimony would look for evidence of UFO Legacy Program operations out of 29 palms Marine Station, but I vehemently disagree. I believe that by studying the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, we can truly gain unparalleled insights into UFO Legacy Program's conduct, testing, and training missions on U.S. soil. Hang tight because after we detail CASEL's encounter, we will spend a significant amount of time exploring the 1997 Hunter Warrior Experiment. We maintained our jets and we did emergency duty on 12-hour shifts. Me and my guys, we were overnight, so we were 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. And a routine night, it's hot out there, we're just hanging out near the Humvee, probably in chairs or hanging out in the back. We get a call on the radio that there's either unexplained or unauthorized something about flare activity in the desert. Maybe 3 to 4 miles out, maybe 5. This is the part that gets a little sketchy, but I've tried to find it on maps. We come over a hill or yank in the trailer behind us, maybe driving 30-35 miles an hour. We come over a hill and all five of us see it. It is a black, from that angle, equilateral triangle, meaning all sides the same, with three white yellowish orbs in each corner. And possibly some kind of venting on the sides, but definitely rounded on the edges, not pointy. That was there hanging in the sky. So accompanying it were about 30, 30 military-type dudes with black uniforms. And 5 to 6 can't remember exactly vehicles. It looked like F-150s, F-350s, the big trucks, jacked up, all black, all matte. Some with canopies, some with antennas. This is all coming in a flash, right? Within 30 seconds of coming down this hill. Enough to notice that the thing was hanging there. Enough to notice it was slightly turning counterclockwise. Perhaps there was some indentation in the center, maybe some type of striation or venting on the side, but these are impressions that I've had to find and integrate with that initial shock and awe of seeing something like this. During the 2nd of March 1997 to the 14th of March 1997, Roderick Castle with his team of 5 to 6 other Marines and the VMA 513 flying nightmares engaged in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting experiment out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms, located in the Southern California desert. Castle and his fellow team operated attached to an experimental Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force. Ironically to this channel, Castle and his fellow Marines participated in the experiment as a Harrier jet crash retrieval team. One night during the 12 day operation, Castle and his team were engaged in overnight crash retrieval duties for Harriers. The Marines were sent in to investigate unidentified flare activity. As you will see in our interview, Castle and I have worked hard to trace almost exactly where this incident took place to reduce as much ambiguity and questions as possible. Our incident occurred within a 7.5 mile radius of Emerson Dry Lakebed, northwest of 29 Palms in about 90 miles southeast of Edwards Air Force Base in the Antelope Valley. If you know my work, my bet you can already guess where we will be going in our investigation. Castle and his Marines came over a hill heading northwest in this area and we can find multiple dirt roads with varying terrain near the Emerson Dry Lakebed. According to the Federal Aviation Administration's special use of airspace, this event occurred within R2501C. I strongly recommend committing this piece of airspace to memory as regular old boring discussion of air traffic organizational policy and restricted pieces of airspace will become paramount to our investigation. So this is what it would look like if you were looking straight up at it. Of course, that's not the angle. If it's more, you know, I want to use that. So you only saw the underside of this, right? Yeah. You cannot speak to what the top would like. I'm going to do this faintly because there's perhaps convex, right? Going inward. Is that what I said before? Or concave. Concave, yes. Same. A soup bowl going forward, but no light emitting from here, but a yellow, a yellowish, whiteish or kind of light. You know, nothing crazy, like psychedelic or but definitely like a ball, a sphere had been embedded into the underside. And that's important you say that, right? It's not just like a flush LED light. It's not like spheres embedded into each corner. Yeah, and the light was deeper than an incandescent or an LED. One of the things you told me when we were talking and this, the light cast, didn't cast onto the ground or the team or anything. The light wasn't cast. You know, not completely non-reflective, which it would be, you know, invisible basically, but all this aspect, very black, blocking out the sky and the stars. You get that deep dark blue in the desert sometimes. The moon was not, I don't know where the moon was that night. It must have been over one of the hills. Coming over the hill in a Humvee, carrying fire suppression equipment, the Marines encountered an enormous, equilateral triangular craft that measured approximately 300 feet in length, hovering silently 150 to 200 feet in the air. The craft emitted no detectable sound, featured no exhaust ports, bolts, seams, or rivets. An unlike a Harrier or helicopter sat stationless in the air, no wobbling, bobbling, or weaving, and featured no exhaust signs like one would see from a Harrier's VTOL thrust engines. The ominous vehicle was matte black or darker with no observable reflectivity and featured three lights at each corner, bright lights, but not blinding. The lights were a combination of yellow, white, and gold, but oddly cast no shadow onto the ground. Below the craft, an estimated 150 to 200 feet away from the castle were unmarked black tactical vehicles and an accompanying unit of approximately 30 armed men in unmarked black uniforms. Like the stories of Wagan and Herrera, these men bore no insignia, identifiable markings, flags, or name tags, and the operators all spoke with American dialects. The vehicles seemed to be all Ford F-150 to F-350 types with all black canopies. Some featured antennae on top of the canopy, but all vehicles were all black. No logos, symbols, chrome, or metallic reflections were visible off of any of the automobiles. Despite Castle and his fellow VMA-513 Marines operating in uniform with authority on U.S. soil, half of the unmarked operators intercepted the Marines at gunpoint. The Marines were disarmed, held at gunpoint, and threatened and ordered to stay silent. You know, so we're alert, but we're, you know, we're, of course, tired, but we don't have night vision stuff. This is low-tech, you know, we're Marines and we've been through combat training, but we're glorified mechanics, so we know we're technicians. So there's a handful of tactical vehicles, all black, and a team of about 30. What was the team doing? Not enough time to even evaluate that, because the minute we came up over about half of them, maybe 15, came running up the hill towards us, and V formations with guns. What were they armed with? Subtype of, like, subtype machine gun. I'm not a guy who knows all the guns, but I did, I am an artist, and I have found a way to use AI to help me with this process. I did send you a picture at one point, and maybe that could be shown. That's exactly what they look like. Other than maybe, you know, my picture ends up with a Caucasian skin tone at the top. Not necessarily the case, but that's the only place any type of skin for any of these men might have been shown. We'll show it on screen, because of course we're working with that 3D artist to recreate the scene, and to your specific specifications. So you're saying all black army helmets, sometimes goggles, black, what looks almost like a ski mask, black fatigues, black tactical gear, submachine gun. Yeah, like, you know, classic black clad mercenary type. You know, again, I'm an artist, so I'm going to see things through a lens, sometimes through art and movies and comics, and these were, if you want to, you want to drop some evil villains and, you know, black clad mercenaries, this is what these guys look like. Yeah, right up harsh language. Get your ass down, get your ass down. Get your ass down. You know, not shooting, but looking like they're ready to. You know, very close to our heads, as if they didn't want us to look at anything. We felt, my initial reaction was, we f***ed up, we came upon something that we shouldn't be involved in, and I'm just going to comply, because I'm scared. You know, like again, we're Marines, we're technicians, and our M16s are in the back of the truck, you know, in Iraq. Right. You guys are there for our suppression. Not even loaded. We don't have magazines on it. We're carrying two bells. Because you were, you know, for the exercise, harrier, crash or triple duty if needed. You're not there to be armed or station. No, no, you know, we fight if we need to fight, but that's not our primary job. So these guys are harsh language head down, they don't want you to see anything. So, and keep in mind this whole thing, max four minutes, maybe three. That's what I want people to know too, is this was, this is a flash, adrenaline filled witness event. You know, this is something I came across accidentally. And I see it now as some very positive, mostly positive thing, that, you know, it opened up some, some avenues for me, but as far as thinking, but something I probably would have, if things hadn't changed, maybe, you know, in the last two, three years, with the energy about this subject, the stigma I probably would have just taken to my grave. You know, maybe told stories to excite, you know, my grandkids or something. Oh, Grandpa Roder's talking about that black triangle again. That was the first demands, you know, out of the vehicle. Out of the, out, out, out, out. Minimum language, which tells you they mean business. And I don't know how else to say it, but anybody that's been there knows what it feels like when you know for certain, this guy's probably this close from shooting you in the head. It's a feeling, it's a real thing that all the acid in your stomach just floods you, you know, you're flood, you're ready to die. Yeah. So, this was all happening at the same time, in multiple ways, because we all are affected by that trauma differently. So me, I might freeze, because I'm starting to conceptualize the whole situation. My other guy might get aggressive. Another guy might run. Did these guys, did they have any insignia, any name tags, any claims? No, no, it's like completely black. On purpose, obvious. You know, every truck was painted matte black. But they spoke with American dialect, right? The few that I could, that I heard. The Puss Watson. And they were very, they knew what they were doing, because they knew certain guys talk, certain guys don't, the rest, keep their mouth shut. So I know that your number one concern was for your life and the life of your fellow Marines. Could you tell what the rest of the convoy was doing, what the trucks were doing, what the Triangle was doing during this time? You know, of course, I've gone over this in my head a billion times. I got my, my kind of theories, but I'm not stuck on anything. It felt more like they were there with it. It's some kind of overwatch. Maybe it was, why I was hovering right there, I don't know. After approximately two minutes, since first observing the craft, and whilst being detained by the operators, the Triangle ceased its slow rotation counterclockwise, climbed at an angle and darted to the Northwest at an extremely high rate of speed. And remember that direction. But again, this craft took off with no visible auditory or optical signs of propulsion or thrust. I did see it zoom to the Northwest, which is the direction, the general direction of the road at a very high rate of speed. Again, no, no noise, no exhaust, nothing. Just slow descent. So it, it rose up a little bit and then just darted? Yeah, like at an angle, at an angle. Did it curve or did it seem like the, the craft would be parallel to the ground? No, yes. That's important, you know. Staying, staying like this. So it didn't turn at an angle, just rose up? Yeah, like it's on some kind of, it needs to stay that direction. Did it seem like there was visible acceleration or did this just? At first it was like a, like maybe a slow buildup, that angle, and then when it hit that, to nothing. Wow. Like a very tiny light to nothing, but you know. And that's what resonates with other reports I've heard. It's just this rapid, rapid acceleration. The craft disappeared almost instantaneously and quickly. The black operators sprinted back down the hill, boarded their tactical vehicles and drove off to the northwest at a high rate of speed. In a state of psychological shock, the men tried and failed to start their humvees. The vehicles remained inoperable for several minutes. They, they seem surprised as we were, but they were ready. Cause that's what they do. That was the sense they're doing their job. The minutes the thing was gone. They've run back down the hill, back to their vehicles. They take off down that road. Same direction as a craft. We pick ourselves up. We're the only best way I can explain is state of shock after a car accident or something. The one younger guy who was, you know, always, the one that talked the most, you know, he said, you know, what's. You know, I remember that distinctly. It's like those first few moments after a car crash, that something gets embedded. Um, got back in the vehicle, attempted to turn the humvee on. It would not start at first. Um, relatively rare. Um, you know, you got a, just a side switch to diesel engine. Pretty reliable. It took maybe five minutes to get it going and try it every minute. I am reminded here of Dr. Kevin Knuth at the 2023 Soul Foundation, where he discussed vehicle malfunctions in the presence of UFOs. You might recall the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where Richard Dreyfus is in his truck investigating power outages and the UFO flies over his truck and the truck stops running. Um, McCamble in 1983 had identified several automobile interference types. You get engine disruption and failure. The engines sometimes fail to restart in the vicinity of a UFO. And when the UFO leaves, sometimes the engine restarts. When I saw that in the movie, I was like, oh, this is just silly at this point. Oh, just restart. You can't just, how is the UFO magically restarting the engine? Um, well, if you think about the physics, you can reason through this. And this is what McCamble had done. If you have a strong enough electric field around this UFO, you could possibly be ionizing the air. How strong is this field got to be? It's got to be on the order of three times ten to the six volts per meter. That'll short out the spark plugs in the car. It'll short out the distributor cam so the car will stop running. But this also brings up an interesting point. If the VMA-513 Marines experienced vehicle failure, this would imply the black operators and their ground tactical vehicles were equipped with countermeasures, maybe similar to something like a Faraday cage to deflect the electromagnetic interference produced by the triangle, arriving back to their quonset hut. The Marines were greeted by their gunnery sergeant and a warrant officer. The commanding officers checked on the Marines, asked them about their mission and what they saw, and reminded the men whatever they encountered was just simple flares, and to not tell others. Um, we drive back to base our shift. This was like two, three. We finished our shift just by standing by again. Not a lot of talking. Back to our quonset huts. By 7 a.m., our gunnery sergeant and our chief warrant officer was hanging out in our quonset hut, which is strange. Marines don't do things with a lot of words. They do things by presence and implying something. Seems like they were checking in on us. We already knew what it was about, but it's just like some flair activity out there, guys. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It was implied we knew what they were saying. This is flares. You guys stumble across something. You shouldn't have seen, but no big deal. Now, it is my opinion the warrant officer and gunnery sergeant were not briefed on the incident, the triangle or the black team. And this is because of the way USAP or unacknowledged special access programs are conducted, which I do believe, in fact, Castle encountered. Therefore, these commanding officers would not have a need to know about the triangle or the operation. Therefore, I think it is highly likely bordering on absolute certainty. The commanding officers were informed Marines in their command had encountered USAP operations and sensitive materials and were to remind their Marines to retain absolute silence about their encounter. Now, one of the most intriguing pieces here is the day following the incident, Castle was subject to an anthrax booster. Castle had, shortly before Hunter Warrior, already received a booster for his already taken anthrax vaccine, so why another immediately after the counter? Indeed, DOD mandates for all US military personnel to vaccinate against anthrax did not go effect until December 1997 and from the Gulf War in 1991 up to 1997, only some troops, if necessary, were given the anthrax vaccines and boosters. The following day, we were called to medical and given an anthrax booster, they called it. Now, as far as we knew, we had already been given the anthrax vaccine, maybe a year prior. Right. It was always controversial, but we did it because we were told and in those days, there was a lot of grumbling among the Marines and there was usually a guy with a rifle near the medical area where they're giving the anthrax, sometimes people would talk. So it doesn't feel like a suggestion you take? Yeah, again, a Marine thing, a suggestion that we're all taking this and keep your mouth shut. Had you already received like a booster? Because I know that, like you said, the anthrax vaccine was already controversial. I know that for some servicemen, it was forced if they were overseas, the Middle East and later on. That's my question. It wasn't like we were getting ready to go somewhere where there had been a scare or something. It was just me and those guys. So again, it's hard not to get, but it was us and there was a guy with a rifle and we signed something like we did before. First time we signed the, took the anthrax vaccine, all of us signed something from what I remember. So after you take the booster, did anyone ever come up to you and tell you do not talk about what you saw after the Warren officer as well speaking to you? Were you ever forced to sign anything regarding the incident or just... Not about that. Nothing specific. Implied, implied. It's a general feel that Marines will keep their mouth shut if told, which is generally true. Now, of course, if it was just Castle here, I wouldn't be surprised. But knowing two other Marines with similar stories, of course, I asked. And to my surprise, I learned that both Michael Herrera and Jonathan Weygant stated they were subject to anthrax boosters immediately after encountering. In Weygant's case, a team of black operators and a crashed non-human UFO. And in Michael's case, a team of black operators and an enormous 300 foot diameter, eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle. Perhaps it really is too conspiratorial to think what could have possibly been the purpose of this anthrax booster, but it is a data point we simply cannot ignore. Following his exit from the Marine Corps, Castle attempted to push the encounter from his mind while also dealing with the psychological trauma of being detained at gunpoint by American operators on US soil. By 2002, Castle had an additional bizarre experience that may possibly relate to UFO legacy program operations. Wackenhut, now called G4S Solutions, is a prominent private security firm founded in 1954 that is synonymous with UFO legacy programs. I have spoken about Wackenhut previously as the trainers to Department of Energy Special Response Teams, or SRTs, which may have comprised the operators that detained and interrogated Jonathan Weygant in the jungles of northern Peru in late March, early April, 1997. I have also discussed Wackenhut's infamous board member, CIA Deputy Director, NSA Director, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Director of National Intelligence, Director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, Bobby Ray Inman. I have discussed Inman in numerous projects, so I recommend checking out any of these videos. It's only become more significant now once I started doing some research and realizing possible sources of those type of mercenaries that do that work. And a combination of my Marine Brothers, Herrera, Weygant, hearing their stories and being like, finally there was a triangle, enough information that I could start digging locations, contracts, government contracts back in the 90s in the term, not the term, the company Wackenhut kept coming up. And then I remember I was recruited, not a recruit, I received a letter of an event, a recruiting event by them. When I first got out of the reserves, the New York Army National Guard in 2002. And it was within three months of me getting out. At the time I figured I'm just on a list of veterans, however they got that, they were data mining and they got my email. But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt, if nothing else it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset. Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters. They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1 Cobra's, Super Cobra's, which I knew enough about that I could work on them. But that's interesting because you were just training as a helicopter flight medic, that wasn't your MOS, your MOS was? I'd left the ordnance behind at the New York Air National Guard at Syracuse. So they knew something about you, if they knew that you were actively training as a helicopter flight medic. In 2002, three years after he left service, Castle was approached out of the blue by Wackenhut to join their helicopter teams. Wackenhut seemingly knew all about Castle's military service record in training as a helicopter flight medic. But why discuss this, and why is Wackenhut important to mention, and what significance can we find in Wackenhut attempting to contract a Marine Corps Sergeant, who seemed to observe clandestine UFO legacy program operations? Well, aside from the possible involvement with the DOE NEST, or Nuclear Emergency Response Teams, that brutalized Waygant and having Inman serve on their board of directors, Wackenhut is one of the most infamous and prolific private security agencies associated with UFO legacy program operations. Wackenhut has both been implicated with performing security for UFO legacy program sites, or in Waygant's case, possibly involved with clandestine UFO crash retrieval operations. We mention Wackenhut only ever so briefly now, but please keep them in your mind for later for much more investigation, and the possibility that the team Castle observed was a Wackenhut trained and manned DOE SRT. Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security for many U.S. and DOE installations, and these include the Nevada Test Site and ever-elusive Groom Lake Area 51. Famously, Wackenhut worked perimeter security for Area 51 and caught Bob Lazar and his friends who attempted to camp out on Bureau of Land Management Lands overlooking Dreamland to observe test flights of the sports model UFO, quite an interesting little piece of UFO lore here. Now, let's finally analyze Castle's testimony in its entirety to transform a firsthand UFO encounter into what I propose is a unique glimpse into UFO legacy program operations. Castle's sighting of the Triangle and its operational ground team occurred within the area of operations of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center 29 Palms. During the 2nd to 14th March 1997, Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment while Castle was attached to a special-purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force. Recall how I mentioned earlier that true insights into Castle's testimony occur when we analyzed the Hunter Warrior experiment out of USMC 29 Palm Center. Indeed, as I mentioned, I believe USMC's involvement in UFO legacy programs is slim to none and as you will see shortly, our analysis will turn us away from the USMC completely. Let's now briefly touch on again the Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment. Hunter Warrior sought to explore experimental methods to increase the area of influence and combat effectiveness of Marine units by utilizing a variety of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques. This experiment was conducted with three core objectives in mind, tactical operations on the disperse non-contiguous battlefield, C4I or command control communications computers and intelligence to harness a single shared digital comms network over multiple battlefield areas and enhancement of fire support and targeting improvements. Indeed, according to a 1997 USMC news release titled Findings Released on Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, Hunter Warrior could be neatly summarized as an experiment that, quote, took a look at enhancing Marine units effectiveness by utilizing a combination of experimental equipment and new warfighting tactics and techniques, end quote. It is the same news release we can even garner insights on Castle's Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force or as the USMC call it, SPM-A-G-T-F-X. We can learn that this special task force was involved not only in the three objectives of Hunter Warrior, but additionally all three phases which included Phase 1, focus on reconnaissance surveillance, shaping and deception operations by both Experimental Special Purpose Marine Airground Task Force and the Operating Aggressor Force. Phase 2, study of targeting for initial engagements by air and long-range indirect fire missions. And finally, Phase 3, major night movement by the Operating Forces, additional targeting for the Task Force, and culmination with a mobile raid on opposing forces. Recall how Castle's experience occurred whilst performing overnight crash retrieval exercises for AV-8B Harrier jets. It is by considering this, I wager this incident occurred during the third phase of Hunter Warrior. And before we go any further, let's revisit a few details of Castle's encounter. Castle encountered a massive, exotic, human-made aerospace vehicle that I will make the case was reverse engineered from non-human technology alongside a heavily armed ground team equipped with tactical vehicles resistant to the craft's electromagnetic effects. This clandestine team was operating in the area of operations of, at the time, the largest experiment to date by the newly renamed Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory involving several ground and air combat units. Clearly, the Triangle and its clandestine Special Mission Unit did not choose the remote uninhabited area of Emerson Dry Lakebed that was right smack in the middle of the Hunter Warrior experiment to be seen by friendly American servicemen. The team chose an active warfighter experiment zone to operate in the shadows. Due to these factors, it is bordering on certainty the Triangle and the clandestine team wish to operate on range in the AO of the Hunter Warfighter experiment undetected. But what was their objective? I theorize this team and its craft secret via USAP, or Intelligence Community CAP, Controlled Access Program. Wish to attach themselves to Hunter Warrior to train and run practice ops alongside blue, a.k.a. friendly assets while maintaining secrecy hidden out of sight from blue soldiers, personnel, vehicles, comms, networks, etc. But let me explain. As I have already mentioned, Castles' experience strikes similar chords to that of Herrera and Weigant. In Weigant's case in 2009, the young Marines stumbled upon a clandestine team with tactical vehicles actively loading containers, possibly filled with humans under an enormous octagonal alien reproduction vehicle in the jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia. In Weigant's case in 1997, just days or a few weeks after Castles' experience, the young Marine was detained and interrogated by a clandestine team in all black that seemingly sprung out of nowhere in the Peruvian jungle after Weigant and other Marines had arrived to the scene of a crashed non-human object. In all three scenarios, young Marines performing their duties were held at gunpoint and threatened with death several times. In one case, Castles, the earliest of the three, the clandestine all black team fled once their overwatch triangle darted out of sight, and clearly some commanding officer or person of authority contacted USMC commanding officers to make sure the Marines who stumbled upon the secret operation by accident would not discuss encountering the USAP or CAP technology. In the other two encounters, the Marines were forcibly stripped of their gear, debriefed, and forced to sign extensive non-disclosure agreements under penalty of death by senior Air Force personnel. This series of events implies that after Castles' encounter, systems were put in place for how these black teams would actually deal with blue or friendly assets stumbling upon their missions, while conducting operations parallel but out of sight to blue assets. Although the triangle and team clearly failed this hypothesized directive in Hunter Warrior to operate in the shadows free from USMCIs, this theory also supports that clearly methods were developed to deal with such blue encounters moving forward. And indeed, I do have further statements to support this hypothesis. Recently, Ross Colthart has come out to state he believes with high conviction that thanks to his many sources the infamous tic-tac encountered by Commander David Fraver of the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego in 2004 was Lockheed Martin's gunkworks technology. Now regarding this controversial statement, I have zero knowledge if the tic-tac was for sure human-made technology. I do, however, have my own framework that there are non-human tic-tacs and human-made copy tic-tacs, but let's entertain Ross's theory here for a moment. If, and I mean if the tic-tac was indeed reverse engineer technology out of the Lockheed skunkworks, the flying propane tank like Kraft operating in restrictive active US Navy airspace that actually flew to the Navy aircraft cap point, which cap is a combat air patrol designated reference point. Don't confuse this with controlled access program cap. Clearly sought to operate and test on blue assets. In this case, Commander David Fraver in the VFA-41 Black Aces. Now, some of the arguments I have seen for the tic-tac not being man-made are claims that the Navy or any US entity would never test technologies on their own pilots and servicemen. But this is incorrect and this is actually done commonly. So, if the tic-tac was flying within the AO or area of operations of the USS Nimitz aviation exercises, this would imply the tic-tac could have been gauging reaction types, times, speeds, methods, etc. of an unknowing force if any blue assets were to ever make unknown enemy contact. Warning the pilots beforehand taint the results and observations. But remember, all this around the Nimitz is just a hypothesis. But if true clearly ties into CASEL and demonstrates instances in which human-made reverse engineered vehicles operate within acknowledged war games or large-scale warfighter experiments to both test on blue assets and operate in the shadows parallel to blue assets. The Nimitz here also gives us a perfect segue into the Navy. Why in the world would we discuss the Navy over USMC? Well, this is because I believe with very strong conviction might I add. The triangular craft and team operated at the behest of the US Navy with likely cooperation or assets sharing with the US Air Force. Let me explain here, and this will shockingly tie into much of my previous work. Returning to the 1997 USMC news release Detailing Findings on Hunter Warrior we can see both the Marine Corps Combat Development Center and the Center for Naval Analysis release summary of experiment findings to the Deputy Commanding General of the MCCDC. The Center for Naval Analysis, administrated by the CNA Corporation, is a Department of Defense and Navy Federally-Funded Research and Development Center, or FFRDC as we will call it from here on out. If you are a longtime viewer of my channel, this is definitely old news. But if you are a new viewer to my channel, the foundation of my research points to FFRDCs and how these semi-private government-controlled research development tests and evaluation centers act as liaison between the United States government slash DOD and US defense contractors for UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs alongside their university counterparts, university-affiliated research centers, or UARCs. Such institutions, according to my work, serve as subject matter experts and provide necessary R&amp;D work on project materials. This would in turn keep knowledge access in technology of unknown origin programs quite strict, only allowing contractor personnel with the need to know full insights into the full extent of the non-human materials on which the programs focus. The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs. UARCs here include the applied physics laboratories at John Hopkins and the University of Washington, as well as the applied research laboratories at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, University of Texas at Austin, and Pennsylvania State University. Penn State's UARC was established in 1945 by future Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker. Walker is a critical figure in the research of my channel. Dr. Walker was named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board as participating in 1950s UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush. If you want to learn more about Walker and Bush, go watch my recent Aztec video. I especially recommend that video because the Center for Naval Analysis can trace its founding to 1942's anti-summery warfare operations group that was formed to assist the U.S. Navy with scientific advice for finding and attacking U-boats. Of course, in the Aztec video, we devote over an hour to analyzing how and why. Scientists involved with anti-summery technology and warfare working under Vannevar Bush's Office of Scientific Research and Development served as primary sources to details and findings on the 25 March 1948 crashed 99.9 foot disc at Aztec, New Mexico. A connection I never in a million years would have thought to make to castle in this video, but here we are. You will find nothing publicly connecting the Center for Naval Analysis to UFO legacy program operations. These connections only exist in the words of my sources to me, so take that for what you will. But why in the world would a naval FFRDC publish findings on Hunter Warrior? Was this for a good old-fashioned corporate reporting write-up, or in my opinion, a secondary report created by a tendril of the naval involvement in UFO legacy program operations that could easily backchannel USAP slash CAP data, reports, and results of ARV applications alongside blue assets back to the Navy while avoiding the marine chain of command? Well, as it turns out, the US Navy was integral to Hunter Warrior, but not in a majorly acknowledged fashion. In 1995, Vice Admiral Robert Spain, then Commander of Naval Air Force Pacific, detailed the possibility of getting naval carrier tactical aviation involved in supporting troops ashore in a December 95 report titled, quote, an operational examination of sea-based aerial fire support for engaged troops, end quote. This proposed a new mission involving different training procedures and employment concepts for aircrews operating from aircraft carriers in close concert with ground forces in a non-linear battlefield. At the behest of Admiral J. Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, in late 1996, General Charles Krulak, Commander of the Marine Corps, quote, requested that Commander Naval Strike Air Warfare Center, Fallon, Nevada, assemble aircrews from Fallon in Naval Air Station, LeMore, California to explore the Hunter Air concept during Hunter Warrior, which evaluated a wide variety of technologies and evolutionary tactics, end quote. The involvement of two naval facilities, the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada, now called the Naval Aviation Warfare Development Center, or NAWDC, as we will call it from here on out, and the Naval Air Station, LeMore, California, or NASA LeMore, as we will start calling it, were an adjunct to Hunter Warrior, bolted on late in the planning state. According to my theory we're about to explore, NAWDC and NASA LeMore entered into Hunter Warrior at the last second, realizing an opportunity to engage their ARV and special mission units in wargame exercise to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc. And of course, we have several avenues to pursue to support this theory. Top Gunner, what really is called Naval Strike Air Warfare Center, came here in 1996, and the Naval Air Station has been here for us a lot longer than that, and it's a tenant command at the base that does a lot of its training and learning and its universities out there when they prepare and train in the desert. In projects past, I have detailed at length programs and efforts of the U.S. Navy to retrieve, exploit, and store non-human vehicles. I really recommend if you haven't seen that, stopping now and watching my video on Navy UFO Legacy Program Operations and come back, which explores everything from the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance Office to Admiral Bobby Ray Inman to the Deep Submergence Systems Project to a 1991 Deep Sea Triangle UFO Recovery. But we will stick to Castle here and get to know NAWDC and Nassla Mour a little more. NAWDC is the Navy's center of excellence for air combat training and development. NAWDC trains naval aviation in advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures across assigned combat mission areas at the individual unit integrated in joint levels, ensuring alignment of the training continuum to set and enforce combat proficiency standards to develop, validate, standardize, publish, and revise tactics, techniques, and procedures.\" NAWDC was set up in 1996 to consolidate the Naval Strike Warfare Center, the Navy Fighter Weapon School Top Gun, in the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapon School Top Dome. NAWDC provides service to aircrews, squadrons, and airwings of the U.S. Navy through flight training, academic instructional classes, and direct operational and intelligence support. And remember that I said Navy Flight Training in the Top Gun School here. I'm sure none of you need reminding to Top Gun or Top Gun Maverick. Attention on deck! Good morning. Welcome to your special training detachment. You see it. Emmanuel Bates, NAWDC commander. You're all Top Gun graduates. The elite. The best of the best. That was yesterday. The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter has leveled the playing field. Details are few, but you'll be able to see details are few, but you can be sure we no longer possess the technological advantage. Success, now more than ever, comes down to the man or woman in the box. Half of you will make the cut. One of you will be named mission leader. The other half will remain in reserve. Your instructor is a Top Gun graduate with real-world experience in every mission aspect you will be expected to master. His exploits are legendary. And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots this program has ever produced. What he has to teach you may very well mean the difference between life and death. I give you Captain Pete Mitchell. Call sign Maverick. This is the first time I've ever seen an officer in the Navy. The Navy is the most successful intelligence in the office of naval research as spearheading numerous U.S. Navy UFO legacy programs. NAWDC is also, quote, the primary authority on training and tactics development. NAWDC provides training, assessment, aviation requirement recommendations, combat search and rescue, close air support, and associated planning support systems, end quote. Funny enough, this naval facility out of Fallon, Nevada also runs the FTRC or the Fallon Range and Training Complex. An enormous training range just north of the Nevada Test Site and Nevada Test and Training Range MRTFB, or Major Range and Test Facility Base, used extensively by Area 51 Groom Lake, a detachment of Edwards 412 Test Wing. A long time critical component of my work has been discussion of air training ranges for UFO legacy program operations. Specifically, test and operational flight testing of reproduction vehicles. This subject will come up again soon, critical in my opinion, to solving the who, what, and why of Castle's Encounter. Now, I have discussed at length aerial training ranges such as Dugway's Utah Test and Training Range, Area 51 and Nellis' Nevada Test and Training Range, and Edwards 412 Test Wing, Restricted Flight Airspace and directly accused each of these locations of operating and testing alien reproduction vehicles on these ranges. Therefore, it is intriguing to me, NAWDC and Fallon, Nevada extremely close to both the NTTR and UTTR and added as adjunct to Hunter Warrior employs its own enormous aerial training range complex. And of course, NAWDC is no stranger to sightings of triangles. In 2002, a witness in Fallon, Nevada reported a quote very large craft at 11.13 p.m. that he thought at first was a B-52. It was a huge flying triangle with no running lights, but it did have some 7-9 dimly lit nodes. It flew at 20 miles per hour making no noise. It was astonishingly close and so large. Total event time was 8 seconds. The witness had a clear view of the side and bottom of the ship but could not make out the leading edge or rear of the craft. Welcome to Naval Air Station LaMoure, the Navy's newest, largest and only West Coast master jet face. NAS LaMoure is home port for every Navy strike fighter squadron on the West Coast. These squadrons are equipped with F-A-18 Hornet and Sufer Hornet aircraft. The Air Station's new 9 million dollar air traffic control tower is part of the Navy's largest and busiest air traffic control facility. NAS LaMoure is the Navy's newest and largest master jet base located in Northern California. LaMoure is home to several carrier air wings as well as the entire strike fighter wing Pacific. And just as NAWDC, NAS LaMoure is no stranger to triangle sightings. These include the 2001 testimony of Navy Aviation Maintenance Administrator Angelo Assetta who stated he observed a triangular glowing object with white glowing points above FRC West NAS LaMoure. After observing the craft travel slowly for three minutes, the vehicle departed at a seemingly instantaneous speed out of sight. Assetta claimed to observe the same vehicle four times between February to October 2012 with no response from the Naval Air Station. NAS LaMoure also shares some intriguing ties with a usual tricky customer of this channel. An Air Force Base I suspect is intimately involved in ARV testing and flight programs. Edwards and their illustrious 412 test wing. And just remember Air Force Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet claimed to observe man-made triangular craft called TR-3B and don't worry we will explore this more shortly over Edwards Air Force Base less than 90 miles away from Castles Encounter. One night a longtime friend of mine and I were standing on top of the Fairchild A-10 hangar at Edwards Air Force Base. It was 2 a.m. and a perfectly clear night with millions of stars visible to the naked eye. This was a very common night at Edwards. I noticed a group of stars who were looking at it seemed to be shifting in color and at the time I could name quite a few constellations. I had just taken an astrology course and definitely knew what the Big Dipper was. I made a C and I made a C in that course I think or B. So I put it out to my friend that the three stars near the Big Dipper in triangular formation were not supposed to be there. We watched as the strobing stars shifted in color from a bright blue to a reddish yellow. After a period of about 20 minutes we could tell that the objects weren't stars because they were getting larger. This was somewhat unnerving. It was further unnerving when the space in between the stars started blocking out the stars in the background. We decided it probably was the top secret Air Force vehicle of some type. Still we weren't sure. At the time I didn't believe in UFOs. That's the honest truth. The vehicle had gone from half the size of the Big Dipper to twice its size in a half hour. It had moved from the west to the east towards Edwards Air Force Base. About that time we could make out the silhouette or outline of the triangle. The lights were possibly exhaust, flared brighter and vanished in an instant from the sky. Of course, as the primary naval facility involved with Hunter Warrior I do believe a strong case can be built. The triangle castle observed hailed from Nautic, but I do for a little bit want to explore the concept that the triangle could have come from Nassla-Mor, Edwards or some sort of combination between the two. Now, do you recall all the way back in this investigation where I mentioned Castle's encounter occurred within the FAA airspace designated as R-2501C? Well, Nassla-Mor is one of few facilities that has access to the R-2508 complex, a section of restricted airspace and associated land presently used and managed by three principal military activities in the Upper Mojave Desert region. The R-2508 complex is compromised of internal restricted areas, military operations areas, air traffic control assigned airspace areas and other special use airspaces. Use of these areas include bombing ranges, supersonic corridors, low-altitude high-speed maneuvers, radar intercept areas and refueling areas. The R-2508 sits near Antelope Valley, a location containing several aerospace facilities, RCS or radar cross-section ranges, and proposed deep underground military bases I've directly accused with UFO legacy program operations, largely Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. R-2508 is managed by the National Training Center for Irwin, Naval Air Weapon Station, China Lake, and the 412th Test Wings Air Force Test Center out of Edwards Air Force Base. In fact, alongside Edwards, China Lake, and Palmdale Plant 42, which I have discussed extensively, and Jeremy Corbell has recently listed street addresses for calling for Congress to investigate UFO legacy sites with boots on the ground. NASLAMOR now joins three other major entities I've connected to UFO legacy programs with R-2508 Poncho 3 Clearance. Poncho 3 Clearance allows only locally-based aircraft in specific restricted sections of R-2508, and I bring up R-2508 not just because of Edwards and its proximity to CASEL's encounter, but because of R-2508 and its principal entities. I have spoken at length previously regarding China Lake, UFO programs, and accused deep underground military bases. But Edwards, well, Edwards and its 412th Test Wing are one of the cornerstone pieces of my work. Recall Ed. Ed is a very real, very vetted individual I consider a hostile witness. A witness who was summoned by SSCI or the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and talked nonsense to avoid implication in illegal programs. Ed spoke to Steven Greer, divulging many details regarding Edwards Air Force Base, and Ed has blocked me on every single platform from which I have contacted him. Ed began his Air Force career at the Nevada Test and Training Range, specifically Nellis Air Force Base, while this NTTR was still called the 98th Range Wing. As an engineering requirements manager with a degree in electrical engineering, Ed claimed he was briefed at Area 51-S4 by an Air Force major into UFO programs. Ed was told numerous craft had been caught or captured, and it was at Nellis Ed became aware of joint UFO programs with specifically Lockheed and Boeing. By the early 2000s, Ed was sent to Edwards for further range engineering work for Air Force and DOD Premier Test and Evaluation Expertise for Aerospace Vehicles. Ed managed the Air Force Flight Test Center, AFFTC, Experimental and Development Test and Evaluation Engineering Resources. This is where barriers are broken. This is where records are set. This is the edge of what we are capable of. This is where we look into a new frontier and see the future. To fly faster, longer and safer. To make our warriors stronger and our enemies tremble. To push the boundaries of what we know is possible. To deliver capabilities to the warfighter that will write history. Our mission is test. Our goal is to find the unknown. We learn all there is about our technology and we go further. We set the standard. We are innovators. Ed was also sent to Edwards Range Orientation as a student in Edwards Infamous 412th Test Wing Air Force Test Pilot School. For multiple years at the Edwards 412th AFFTC, Ed served as Director of Operations for an electronics warfare group operating an acknowledged test infrastructure budget of $700 million. Directly supervising 15 officers, civilians and enlisted personnel. It was as director of an electronics warfare group, Ed claimed to act as the intermediary between scientists and AFFTC pilots of reverse engineered vehicles. Vehicles reverse engineered from extraterrestrial technology, copycat vehicles sometimes manned requiring a pilot, sometimes not. Ed's testimony has so much more to give as do clues to his testimony such as project red light. So please watch my video on him to explore further statements of biologics likely being stored at Wright Patterson Hangar 5. Videos of essentially invisible inspection UFOs and Ed's follow-up career at the Pentagon Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel Chain. Where he observed $34 and $40 billion in respective years go towards non-transfer of authority funds. I vehemently believe Ed's testimony and due to such, Edwards 412th Test Wing is one of the most critical sites, wings and air spaces to uncovering UFO legacy program operations in my opinion. But that's not all. Recall the infamous story of the TR-3B as relayed by Edgar Fouchet. It's exactly what the flying triangle is, the one that's been sighted around the world. It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built. And it may be stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium or your city. Fouchet would disclose his testimony from himself and his five close friends slash sources in 1998. Many have criticized the Air Force Master Sergeant Fouchet for his lack of evidence. But as I have said many times, I have found tremendous value in studying Fouchet's disclosures. According to Fouchet, TR-3B saw prototype flights begin in the early 1970s with successful implementation of gravity warping systems. Fouchet would state three operational prototype systems were flying by 1994. Triangles approximately 250 feet across, quite similar to castles 200 to 300 feet. As well as an enormous 600 foot operational model. Finally I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B. A friend of mine said he'd never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom. The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers. According to Fouchet, the engineering of TR-3B was performed by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan and TR-3B's program was managed by three of six of the US Big Six intelligence agencies, NRO, NSA and CIA. Fouchet would claim the gravity warping propulsion systems were reverse engineered from non-human technology from Sandia National Labs and Lawrence Livermore Labs. Two Department of Energy FFRDCs, and Sandia is of course, as I say, a usual tricky customer of this channel. The circular plasma field accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field Disruptor surrounds a rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse engineered DMF-D and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology. But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you, nor am I. The government will go at any lengths. Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury based. It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy. The MF-D generates a magnetic vortex field which disrupts and neutralizes effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%. Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity. Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force. The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator such as the crew compartment, avionics, MF-D systems, fuels, environmental systems, and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%. This causes the effect of making the aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed, except of course those we didn't build. TR-3B is an altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time. Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude. With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally. So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn. It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance. For those that have seen it, that's how they do it. TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform. The multi-mode propulsion systems can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion. By Fouchet's definition, this makes TR-3B an alien reproduction vehicle. While the craft featured some systems we might associate with prosaia technology such as a triangular airframe, odd but still recognizable rotatable crew compartments, computers, radar, and ECM, or electronics communications measures and ECCM systems, the craft also featured propulsion systems reverse engineered from non-human technology. This then of course draws our attention back to 1988's Fluxliner, that allegedly operated as a copycat saucer with non-human zero-point systems, but also featured disheveled F4 Phantom jump seats and sloppy paints as well as bolted panels. The ARV system for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities was indeed remarkably simple. It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought. You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy, or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes. In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off. Of course, Castle saw only the underside and little of the side profile of the triangle during this experience in the first half of March 1997. But I cannot help but draw strong parallels between the craft Castle observed and Fuchet's TR-3B. Obvious parallels include the 200-foot models detailed by Fuchet resembling the 200-300-foot parameters outlined by Castle, but also reference here Fuchet's detailed illustration of TR-3B. While working with a 3D artist to model Castle's craft, one of the points Castle was absolutely adamant about was that the lights on each vertex of the triangle appeared like embedded spherical orb lights and not flush lighting panels. Although not orb or spherical, we can observe non-flush lights on Fuchet's illustrations that Fuchet described as hydrogen-oxygen-vectored rocket engines to aid in craft propulsion. Additionally, Castle firmly stated each corner of the equilateral triangle was rounded, and the same can be seen in TR-3B. Although the craft was almost vantablack, meaning blacker than black with low reflectivity, Castle observed what appeared to be a concave dome-like structure, unlit in the middle of the triangle. We can clearly see the Mercury Plasma Accelerator Ring MFD Gravity Reduction Device on TR-3B sitting as a large circular feature on the underside of TR-3B. The strongest parallel to me, though, comes in the description of variable-vectored intake vents on TR-3B observable from the top, bottom, and side profiles of the craft. While witnessing primarily the underbelly of the triangle, Castle discussed what appeared to be several ridges or vents between each spherical light on each vertex of the triangle. Could Castle's craft indeed have been the infamous alien reproduction vehicle TR-3B illustrated by Edgar Fouchet? Well, believe it or not, there are even further data points bolstering this hypothesis. But Fouchet's most drastic revelations of TR-3B comes from who he claimed piloted the vehicles. Fouchet would state both military and contractors operated TR-3B, but military pilots were top of their class, elite pilots hailing from the Air Force and Navy test pilot schools like Top Gun stationed at the NAWDC and AFFTC stationed at Edwards. Could Edwards and NAWDC slash NASLAMOR slash naval programs at large really have coordinated to operate reverse-engineered triangular craft and special mission units alongside blue assets in the Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment? While as it turns out, there is even more circumstantial data to suggest so. The southernmost area of R2508 exists roughly 44.5 miles northwest of Emerson Dry Lakebed. And recall Castle's testimony when the triangle departed at incomprehensible speeds. It traveled in a northwest direction back to the direction of R2508 airspace operated by NASLAMOR, China Lake, and Edwards. Back to the direction of Antelope Valley, which for decades has produced myriad UFO triangle testimonies. Back to the direction where Fouchet claimed the Navy and Air Force top pilots operated TR-3B. And back to the direction in which Ed had years of first-hand experience with reverse-engineered vehicles. While I do believe TR-3B, or whatever you want to call a triangular ARV, R2508, Edwards, NAWDC, and NASLAMOR are cornerstone and critical pieces to this investigation and my prevailing theory. I do want to explore an alternate origin point for the craft, still involving naval and Air Force UFO legacy program operations. Edwards and its R2508 are nestled within Antelope Valley. Antelope Valley has historically served as the nexus of U.S. aerospace technology. Housing the infamous Air Force Plant 42, Lockheed's Gunkwerks, the former Norton Air Force Base, the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, and facilities Northrop Grumman, Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas operate as radar cross-section facilities. These three radar cross-section facilities, specifically Northrop Tahan and Lockheed Hellendale, are locations I have discussed extensively in prior work. Antelope Valley in Palmdale, California has served as a cornerstone U.S. military-slash-private contractor-classified aircraft production and maintenance location. With Air Force Plant 42 alone producing many of the United States' most famous advanced aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, the B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk, SR-71 Blackbird, F-22, and F-35 Lightning, and as I stated earlier, Corbell recently listed street addresses for Plant 42 in relation to UFO legacy program operations. First and foremost is Senator Rounds should ask to see Lockheed's Plant B-6 complex in Burbank, California, 2300 Empire Avenue, and then I would like to, you know, maybe he should go ask to see Northrop Grumman's Plant 42 in Palmdale, which is 3520 East Avenue M Street. I mean, look, the addresses are there. While any of these aerospace locations mentioned above could have, and in my opinion do, engage in engineering, research development, test and evaluation, and construction of ARV in the Antelope Valley, I do want to center our attention to the radar cross-section facilities Tehan and Hellendale. But what is an RCS facility? To summarize, these locations utilize high-frequency radio waves to test aircraft radar signatures. This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing radar cross-section. The radar cross-section sites utilize large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar. Many RCS facilities such as the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War. This led the majority of the installations being built primarily underground to hide RCS pylons, equipment, models, and technologies from Soviet spy satellites. Numerous researchers over the years have accused the Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft. The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrances for the Ant Hill Dome as well as actually been flown over these sites and personally observed the electromagnetic pulse weapons systems that are used to down craft. Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it. I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive. So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway. It's just where the manmade UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out. They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-grabbitic anti-grab. The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic. They just go boom up, but they're placed over different diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these. We don't have time to go through. And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict. I myself have covered extensively the legends of Tehan and rumors of an enormous underground installation connecting Tehan to Edwards, China Lake, and myriad UFO legacy program sites. Go watch my video on Dumbs or Northrop to learn more there. We study Tehan in Hellendale because of the artwork of forensic artist Bill MacDonald in his 1992 piece Tohachapi Triangle. MacDonald met with four old engineers at the Denny's and Antelope Valley in the spring of 1992. Two of the engineers hailed from Lockheed Hellendale RCS plants and two hailed from Northrop Tehan RCS plants. Fed up with the security, quote unquote, impositions that affected their quality of life and the locations at which they were required to live out a significant portion of their lives. The engineers dictated a craft they had designed and constructed called the XF-131 Supercentinal. As I have said before, MacDonald was then contacted by Chris Carter of the X-Files to include the very real XF-131 in Season 1, Episode 1 of the X-Files. I have talked to MacDonald personally, attempting to contact these engineers, but MacDonald is unwilling to reveal their identities and I respect his decision. Could, less likely in my opinion, instead of TR-3B, the triangular craft bin and XF-131 Supercentinal kept in the bowels of Tehan or Hellendale that saw regular test flights over R2508 with pilots from the AFFTC. That was called to action by NAWDC and NASLAMOR to conduct test operations in the Haunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment, aiming to get ARV teams on ground, undetected in areas populated by blue forces. I do, lastly, want to tie everything to Castle being contacted by Wackenhut in 2002. When the security contractor attempted to recruit Castle into their helicopter teams, Castle remarked to me how bizarre it was, Wackenhut seemingly knew everything about him. But thinking back now, knowing what I know about Wackenhut, it may have been an attempt, if nothing else, it was an attempt to pull me in as an asset. Because I did work on, they were looking for people that worked on helicopters. They didn't specifically say ordnance, they did say experience with the UH-1 Huey and the AH-1s, Cobra's, Super Cobra's. And this leads me to a theory I'd like to propose. This theory says that the team Castle encountered in 1997 was not Air Force or Navy enlisted personnel, JSOC or Joint Special Operations Command or SOCOM Special Operations Command teams, but instead a private team from Wackenhut working with the Navy and Air Force. In this theory, in 2002, Wackenhut attempted to recruit Castle to these clandestine teams, possibly to a group like the infamous quote-unquote Blue Boys. Alleged UFO crash retrieval rapid response teams operating from within US military bases employing helicopter units. As I stated earlier, Wackenhut historically provided professional security, especially perimeter security, for many US DoD and Department of Energy installations. And these included the Nevada test site, the Ever Elusive Groom Lake Area 51, and Los Alamos National Labs. And additionally, Wackenhut allegedly served as a CIA front in the Cold War and beyond. A theory likely proven in the JFK files in a released March 1963 memo detailing the Wackenhut Corporation wishing to serve as cover for the CIA. Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank excellent researcher Blocked Epistemology for this find. In the 1989 book The Terrorism Industry by Edward S. Herman, the board of Wackenhut and connections to US intelligence agencies was scrutinized. Remember how in my SAIC video, I referred to SAIC by its nickname, NSA West, as so many US DoD and intelligence officials traded their stars and stripes in for business suits at SAIC. It seems that Wackenhut operated as a similar revolving door for accomplished military and intelligence professionals. In his book, Herman discussed how two figures I've associated with UFO legacy program operations in the past served on the board of Wackenhut in the 1980s. And this is not to mention Bobby Ray Inman, a pillar stone of US intelligence, SAIC, and Wackenhut, I believe is one of the most key members to UFO programs in history. One such figure mentioned by Herman was Frank Carlucci, US Secretary of Defense, and an individual I wagered may have been alongside Brad Sorenson to the classified section of the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, where flux liner alien reproduction vehicles were observed. Additionally on the Wackenhut board was William F. Raybourne, who also served on the board of SAIC and was also the director of the Polaris Summary Program in the US Navy. Navy Chief Scientist of Special Projects, John Pena Craven, stated he was ordered to carry out the Deep Submergence Systems project to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform deep ocean engineering. To satisfy the whims of one project's sand dollar, a project that had cataloged every item of US national security interest resting on the sea floor tagged for retrieval. According to Craven, this program was nestled within another program, nestled within another, itself hidden within another program nestled under the Polaris Summary Program. To understand why I made the case sand dollar involved undersea UFO crash retrieval, go watch my US Navy Legacy Operations video. In my video on Jonathan Weigandt, I proposed a theory that the UFO crash retrieval team were Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy Special Response teams or SRTs. But overall wager, the crash retrieval team was more likely nearby US Army Green Berets recruited as special mission unit for USAT procedures. But let's talk a little bit about SRT. This anti-nuclear terrorism team is the DOE's own elite task force. An elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across the United States, the special response team has arrest on site authority and at least in the 1980s donned all black outfits and gear similar to the outfits described by CASEL. Historically, in the late 90s, DOE SRT units also provided security for sensitive DOE defense nuclear facilities including Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs. These DOE SRT teams were trained by Wackenhut. And not just trained by Wackenhut, but these elite, highly capable DOE SRTs were comprised of Wackenhut employees. According to the General Accounting Office, beginning in 1987, Wackenhut subcontracted Department of Energy Guard Services, not only A, controlled access to sites, conducting roving patrols of site perimeters and responded to physical security alarms, B, conducted property searches and inspections of facilities, personnel, and vehicles, and C, provided protection for classified and unclassified documents and other government property and facilities, but also that Wackenhut provided special response teams to act at the behest of the DOE. SRTs are really no joke. These individuals are the ultimate Department of Energy, INDUSEC, or industrial security team entrusted with transporting nuclear materials around the continental United States. One of the reasons I suspected Wackenhut DOE SRT was not involved in Wagan's case is because SRTs historically have acted within the continental United States, not abroad. After all, these Wackenhut trained and staffed teams do have arrest authority in quote-unquote recovery operations on U.S. soil. So, what if the Special Mission Unit, accompanying the Triangle during Hunter Warrior, was indeed a Wackenhut trained and staffed Department of Energy SRT that acted parallel to CASEL, who was busy and dutifully engaging in USMC AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval exercises? This clandestine SRT unit instead operated alongside Navy and Air Force ARV programs, engaged in UFO crash retrieval exercises within the continental United States. When investigating the case of Jonathan Waganth, I arrived to the conclusion based off of several lines of thinking the on-site scientific team securing the UFO crash site was DOE NEST, or DOE Nuclear Emergency Response Team. Part of my rationale here is the fact DOE NEST's governing authority is the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement. The Schumer Rounds UFO legislation called the UAPDA references this 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement as a system leverage to improperly classify UFO materials, hardware, biologics, etc. as, quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear information, end quote. This same logic here for Waganth and DOE NEST applies to CASEL and DOE SRT. If SRT units, formally trained and staffed by Waganthut, are indeed conducting domestic UFO crash retrieval operations, just as with NEST, the DOE could likely leverage the same 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement to effectively black hole any UFO retrieval operations, recovered materials, etc. I myself have personally heard rumors from sources of UFO crashes being transported across the continental United States, haphazardly labeled nuclear material and guarded by SRT. After all, if UFO materials are indeed obfuscated under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act as trans-classified foreign nuclear information, which I fully believe it does, does it not make perfect sense highly trained DOE SRTs entrusted with transporting U.S. nuclear materials and weapons would be the same operators to transport recovered craft? If this team observed by CASEL was indeed Waganthut, this wouldn't be the first time Waganthut suffered such a folly. Meet Richard Mingus, a federal services security guard at the Nevada Test Site from 1957 to 1953, who often times worked at Area 51. In 1982, Mingus was securing an underground nuclear test area at Area 6 on the Nevada Test Site while the base featured a live nuclear bomb exposed above ground. While lowering the bomb underground for explosives testing, the base at Area 6 quickly came under attack by armed combatants. Mingus was primarily responsible for coordinating the breach of security up through the chain of command, all the way up to President Ronald Reagan as the event was a significant national security issue. It was later determined the men attacking were simply conducting a drill from where else but Waganthut. In late April, early March, if this was late April, I believe this was the last one or two days of April into early March, and this is the time that he actually reached out to David Grush and expressed his willingness and desire to both testify to and deliver his testimony to Congress. Now, I'm recording this video, this outro, on August 2025, so I believe it was late July, there was an image floating around Twitter and so forth in UFO circles of Castle pictured with Stephen Greer, Eric Burleson, Michael Herrera, and others. And this is because after he reached out to David Grush, he decided to also reach out to Stephen Greer, and of course Stephen Greer brought him to Representative Burleson and so forth. Now, I had, like I said, I had known about Mr. Castle long before then, before that image, before that trip, I just had not made the introduction to him, reached out to him, I was still in the process of researching his history and vetting him. We talk about that a little more in our full interview, but let's start to break things down. Now, distinct thing here, a lot of people are trying to delineate between the term whistleblower and witness, and I think we did that in this video. Mr. Castle isn't necessarily a whistleblower, but he is indeed a witness, and as we demonstrate in this video, what he witnessed is not as simple as seeing a craft. You know, there are plenty of stories from USMC vets, Army vets, Air Force vets, Navy vets who have seen Tic Tac craft, who have seen craft close to the bow of their ships and so forth. What Mr. Castle saw was what eye wager is an alien reproduction vehicle, an accompanying black team, the same sort of team that both Wagant and Herrera saw. This team armed in all black featured US Army helmets featured. You know, we try to tuck into the guns MP5 machine guns, not necessarily M16A4s or M4 carbines. The presence of an MP5 for all the gun fans out there would imply that this is possibly, you know, not a standard military unit as we saw. And one of the reasons why I led this was a PMC private military contractor SMU special mission unit out of Wackenhut. And this is critical. These times are critical because this occurred mere weeks before the case of Wagant. And one of the arguments I made that I had a lot of fun doing in this video was discussing, hey, maybe the way this team handled Castle, maybe after they handled Castle because we know hit the black ops team just ran down the hill, drove back northwest to the direction of Edwards at the direction of R-2508. Right after that, the team brutalized Wagant, detained him. So I believe there might have been different sorts of safeguards put in place if the teams encountered blue units. And possibly this was exactly why the Navy tacked on to Hunter Warrior in the very end as an adjunct and put in some ARV teams. Now, before we break things down, I know I put out a big thesis on there in my post video rant. I never read from a script, but let me go ahead and reread the thesis from which I constructed most of my arguments. So we can have it all neatly recapped because I know we had an hour and 45 minutes. So let's just go through that. I'll tell you when I'm starting and I'll tell you what I'm ending starting for my work in theory. March 2nd to roughly March 14th, 1997 saw the execution of Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiments that involved the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, 29 Palms, California. The experiment was designed to examine three specific areas. The Center for Naval Analysis published summaries of the findings alongside the Marines by 1 August 1997. Having previously expressed interest in carrier tactical aviation involvement in supporting troops offshore in 1995, a report titled An Operational Examination of Sea-Based Aerial Fire Support for Troops Engaged was written by the Navy. After recommendation of, and I'm going to skip over this guys because I know I read a little bit in the video, but of Navy Admiral J. Johnson to the Marine Corps Commanding General, the Navy Nautic, or what was previously known as the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada, assembled air crews alongside the Naval Air Station in the Moore, California to explore Hunter Air concepts during Hunter Warrior, which on the surface evaluated a wide variety of technologies and evolutionary tactics. Involved naval experiments here, as we discussed, were considered adjunct, bolted on late in the planning stage. Tying into Castle's encounter of the enormous floating triangle, an armed ground team, Nautic and Nass, the Moore, engaged a Black Ops crash retrieval, or tactical team, or special mission unit, SMU, in war game exercises to practice operations, recoveries, missions, etc., alongside blue assets without detection, and obviously, due to Castle's encounter, this directive failed and failed miserably. Rational here can be extended to and pause. I know this is controversial, but I did want to explore it because it is pretty intriguing to me, and I'd like to do a little more poking around because as I stated, I have heard that there are human tic-tacs and non-human tic-tacs, and I tend to agree with that sentiment. I'm not staking my position or opinion in anywhere in the sand regarding Nimitz, but I thought this was interesting to explore, anyways, back to the thesis. Rational can be extended to the 2004 Nimitz tic-tac encounter. If the tic-tac was indeed reverse-engineered technology from the Lockheed Skunk Works, operating in restricted, active US Navy airspace, this draws parallels to Castle's experience. As the tic-tac would have been conducting test missions, flights, etc. among blue assets, possibly to gauge blue responses to such vehicles or approaching cap points without detection or as little detection as possible. Possible reason for this tic-tac testing on blue assets is to see reaction types, time, speeds, methods of an unknowing force if there was enemy contact. Warning the pilots beforehand taints the results. Quick pause, I'm not advocating for anything or making claims, I'm just exploring this concept. The Navy or other US entities would never test on their own pilots or servicemen, some people claim, well, this is wrong, it's done every day. Further parallels to Castle involve the late March, early April experience of Lance Corporal Jonathan Waganth in the jungles of Peru. By Castle's description, there is a hypothesis that could be made. Castle encountered the same type of team Waganth encountered training, working alongside blue assets without detection. Of course, in both cases, such training failed. Then this raises further questions. In Waganth's testimony, if the DOE Ness team he encountered that arrived via CH-47s was the team alongside the DOE Ness team, actually DOE SRT Wackenhut, and I do want to pause here, and you know what, let's just throw away the script, guys. This is the time we don't read from the script, so I do want to dive into Nautic and Nasslemore a little more. But, you know, when I was reading the terrorism industry book, and to learn more a little bit about the board of Wackenhut and some, you know, various chairman that they had, including Bobby Ray Inman, including Frank Harlucci, including Admiral William F. Raybourne, I also saw in that book that in the late 80s, early 90s, that Wackenhut had established fobs or forward operating bases or places of business in specifically Peru. So now I really want to re-engage the idea that possibly DOE SRTs were the team that Waganth encountered as well. This SRTs are, I don't have any evidence or sources to back this up, but I am confident in that, in this hypothesis, that the DOE SRT privately trained and staffed by Wackenhut is what Castle encountered and now possibly Waganth. And what strengthens this theory is the argument I made, such as DOE Nest and such as so much in DOE and NNSA, that the SRT team could fall back on the 1954 atomic energy agreement to basically obfuscate any mission, any retrieval, any operation they're doing, and this can be misclassified as transclassified for in nuclear materials. So there is no need to divulge any information to any entity that does not have a strict need to know or is not on the bigot list of the associated CAP USAP or WAVED USAP. Now, Nautic and Nassel Amour isn't that interesting. I was so thrilled to build a thesis around this and being able to see that Nautic and Nassel Amour have their own sorts of triangle sightings. That was pretty intriguing to me. And then the tie-ins to Edwards. Now, where were these craft stationed? There is an argument to be made that Nassel Amour held the craft, that Nautic held the craft, that Edwards held the craft, but I do think it is quite plausible. And in my opinion, likely that this program operated between Navy and Air Force out of these three locations and possibly China Lake. Fallon, Nevada is interesting as this is quite close to Area 51 and the Fallon Test Range is quite close to the Nevada Test Range. Anybody who's watched my videos and Jesse Michaels as well, hey, I'm rep at his merch. We'll know the story of Randy Anderson who claimed while doing test stops out at Area 51 Auxiliary sites on land owned by the Department of Energy, he himself has come across electric-ovidic triangle craft that the US hasn't stored. Now, also near Fallon, Nevada, Nautic is a Newark Keyport location that is supposedly a depot for underground mine storage. Now, if you watched my, I think it was SAIC or US Navy video, I talked about Newark Keyport as being almost a data acquisition type entity within US Navy legacy program operation. So that is something to chase down as well. As far as pilots here, we know that the triangle craft, if we're relegating this to TR3B, that according to Fouche that the pilots come out of the AFFTC, the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center and the Air Force Test Pilot School out of Edwards, and we know from Ed, or at least I know from Ed, that this is indeed a place where I believe with extremely high certainty that elements of the 412th Test Wing and Edwards and likely various Air Force MRTFBs including the Utah Test and Training Range, Nevada Test and Training Range collaborate to test flight ARV. Now, I know what Fouche said, that these were test pilots from the Navy and Air Force and I know, guys, I know Nautic Top Gun is not a test pilot school, this is an active fighter school. The Navy's test pilot school is actually out at PAX River, which is interesting as well, that's another interesting connection. But quite intriguing that Castle's testimony, especially with a craft going Northwest and the team going Northwest into R-2508 airspace, ties into Edwards and Edwards Restricted Ranges when we also know that Nautic and National Moor had involvement as well. So, the reason I think this craft is an alien reproduction vehicle is because of the team associated that Castle encountered and because of just some of the characteristics of the craft. I know that Kuzlowski and Phillips out of Arrow have begun recently talking about triangular craft and these being advanced human platforms and I do agree with that and I am still of the mind that some of these triangular craft are alien reproduction vehicles in the sense that Fouche is right that their propulsion systems are based off of non-human technology or perhaps other aspects of their propulsion, their survivability, their mass reduction, their internal mass reduction, various aspects have been leveraged from non-human sources. I think it is intriguing and I think that from Castle's description it sounds like what he saw was TR-3B. Guys, I hope you appreciate those renders we have in this video. I think they are wicked cool. But remember, Castle only saw the underside of the craft in part of the side so he did not see the top of the craft so we left the top blank. No features there, not like the TR-3B with the raised crew compartment in the middle because we do not know what was up there. What is interesting and what kind of takes me back to TR-3B is the concave section in the middle and if you actually look at Sal Paese's patents out of, not associated with, but out of Pax River, I think this was in 2017 for inertial mass reduction craft, you'll see a triangle with a large concave center as well, interesting tie-in and of course Castle talks about the ridges in between the lights of the triangle and that reminds me closely of TR-3B as well. One of the things we have to pay attention to what Castle said is the lights on each vertex weren't just flush lights or recess lights, these almost seemed like orbs embedded in the triangle and these gave off a whitish, yellowish, goldish color but did not cast light in the surrounding area. There's so much to chew through here guys, so much awesome stuff that relates to so much of what I've talked about on my channel and so much in UFO lore. So, I will be releasing the Castle interview soon, we talk a lot more, we talk about the anthrax vaccine, we talk about the other marines specifically because I know what you're thinking, there are multiple other marines with Castle and also behind the scenes we're trying to track down these marines to talk to them as well. You know, part of the issue with cases like Wageance and Michael Herreras is we can't necessarily pin down exactly where this event happened, you know, in Sumatra, Indonesia or in Wageance case, even if it was northern, southern Peru, if it relates to Bukalpa, where, but what is interesting here with Castle is we do know that within just a couple mile radius of Emerson Dry Lakebed, this is where this encounter happened and we know the exact direction in which the craft and the team departed. So, there's a lot more to true through and a lot of interesting things to follow up on. Again, that interview will come out soon. I actually went out to where Mr. Castle lives, spent a couple days with him and we were courted out there. So, wonderful things to say about the man, he's been all but gracious. Same with other witnesses I've talked to, before we started talking, he was incredibly nervous, incredibly nervous. But we spent some time together, he started to open up and the man was a joy to talk to and I hope to get him back in front of some congressmen. I'd like to be there with him maybe and maybe we can present his testimony and this thesis together to maybe Rep Burleson or someone similar, but that is what I would like to do next. Some bookkeeping stuff, guys. There's been a lot of buzz about the Danny Jones and Chris Ramsey podcasts. Those have had an insane amount of views and it's a true honor that each of you guys watch that and support this channel. There's so many new viewers to this channel, I think we've got almost 20,000 from those two interviews. So, if you're new to this channel, I love you. If you are a longtime viewer of this channel, I also love you. In the comments all the time, I see so many people that have been with me leaving comments since day one, since I had 20 subscribers, 30 subscribers, names that come to mind. Mighty Mo, Tanner Johnson, Birdie606. So, a lot of you guys I recognize and I appreciate each and every one of you. Remember, I do have a Patreon. I would love if you support the channel. That's how I fund these trips. That's how I fund the 3D designers and that's how I keep my channel going. I don't gatekeep content, so please just support what you think the channel is worth. Your support means the absolute world to me and if you don't want to support on Patreon, at least give this video a like, a comment, and subscribe to the channel. I think every YouTuber says this, but it actually does help quite a bit. But I appreciate everybody being here and if you watch the end here, thank you so much. I got some exciting stuff coming down the corners. We got some hearings coming up in September. I think we have a date for that. I will be there for that and I know I haven't done it in a long time, but I think I will do a live stream before and after the hearings and I will be there for a lot of fun. I will be boots on the ground for that. Remember, I got a Patreon support the channel. Like and subscribe. I will catch everybody on the next episode. I'm trying to think if there is anything else I missed. Yes, there is. Randy Anderson talked about Area 51 and seeing triangles there. I also have my friend, the Army Public Affairs Officer, who was at Area 51 at Groom Lake who on the cleared flight line when he was with some active colonels there, saw a triangle take off vertically at incomprehensible speeds, making no sounds, not disturbing any of the dust around it. I think I talked about that on Danny Jones, but I just remember that now. We will wrap that up today. I think we are approaching on two hours. With that being said, guys, thank you everybody for joining me and thank you for supporting Mr. Castle. I will link his Twitter down below. He is a great guy. Feel free to talk to him. I appreciate his courage coming out and thank you so much for watching. Catch everybody next time. Bye.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/ShoUyC1aip0/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>AV-8B Harrier</li> <li>Angelo Assetta</li> <li>Assetta</li> <li>B-21 Raider</li> <li>Bill MacDonald</li> <li>Bill McDonald</li> <li>Blocked Epistemology</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Bobby Ray Inman</li> <li>Brad Sorenson</li> <li>Bush</li> <li>Castle</li> <li>Castles</li> <li>Castles Encounter</li> <li>Charles Krulak</li> <li>Chris Carter</li> <li>Chris Ramsey</li> <li>Concave</li> <li>Danny Jones</li> <li>David Fraver</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>Denny</li> <li>Ed</li> <li>Edgar Fouchet</li> <li>Edward S.

Would you be surprised to learn that UFO-UAP encompass only phenomena and transmedial craft operating within Earth's atmosphere and under the planet's oceans? In fact, the USG, particularly NORAD and the US Space Force, have an entirely different designation for UFOs entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere, fast walkers and slow walkers. Hey guys, it's UAPGurb, I'm back and as always thank you for returning to the channel. Today we are going to go down the deep rabbit hole of space-bound UFOs known as fast walkers. Too little the question is asked, how often are UFOs observed in outer space? Well, the USG is clearly concerned about this question and has a storied history of investigating fast walkers. So let's get some terms out of the way and again, remember there is a distinction here from UFO. The Walker call sign describes objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere at variable speeds. Slow walker for low velocity objects and fast walkers, well, you guys can probably guess. Today we are only going to focus on the latter, the fast walker. This distinction is crucial as during an age of increasing, albeit surface level UFO transparency, it allows the USG to avoid declassification slash Freedom of Information Act requests for fast walkers and slow walkers. In late 2023, John Greenwald of the Black Vault received a decisive and final response to his countless FOIA requests on the term fast walkers and slow walkers. This response came from the US Space Force, the famed USAF space division. With this request, Greenwald sought any reports, information, detailed military info on this topic. In response, Space Force issued a full denial to divulge any material under FOIA, citing exception one, as a denial to disclose which states quote, under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. But curiously, this wasn't actually the first time Greenwald was denied access to any information on fast walker. Ten years earlier in 2013, Greenwald submitted a similar request which was handled by USNorthcom, the United States Northern Command which oversees NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command. NORAD is headquartered at Space Force Base in Colorado. I know this doesn't seem very important now, but keep NORAD in mind. Anyways, Northcom and NORAD responded to Greenwald stating fast walker documentation is quote, currently and properly classified, again by executive order 13526, quote, considered critical to national defense or foreign policy and is thus controlled by the US government. But there were two documents that were provided to Greenwald. One, a paper titled Orbit Determination of Sunlit Illuminated Objects Detected by Overhead Platforms from 1989 and Space-Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging Passive Sensors from 2008. But NORAD's refusal to share any data on fast walkers or UFO tracking data doesn't start with Greenwald. Check this out, this is an extremely interesting excerpt from the book, Clear Intent, the government cover-up of the UFO experience by authors Barry J. Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett. This book contains both a section of the scanned NORAD UAP reporting sheet, but also a chapters on UFOs and FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act. Within this chapter is a request to NORAD for UAP tracking data to which NORAD replies will require over 18,000 man hours and a cost of $155,000 at the time in 1979, which would equate to well over half a million USD today. NORAD also refused to waive the fees on a follow-up request three years later. So let's use the documents provided to Greenwald to get a jump start on fast walkers and utilize any other clues to try and learn more about them. We can trace this fast walker designation to originate with NORAD, utilized to detect objects entering or leaving atmosphere, as I mentioned above, at significant speeds by US defense systems. The first of the two documents, the one on orbit determination of sunlit illuminated objects, was written by USAF Captain Richard P. Ossedax. And this details the joint efforts of NORAD and the Air Force Foreign Technology Division to investigate uncataloged space-bound objects detected by reflected sunlight passing through satellite sensors designated as fast walkers. This document states that the data on these objects has been recorded since 1972 by, quote, certain ballistic missile early warning satellite systems located at various geostationary locations. And also, this paper sought to determine orbit or motion of these objects, but was deemed unsolvable by former efforts by one researcher, Wong, as mentioned. Shockingly, the report states the fast walker analysis has become an increasingly important issue due to the increase in geosynchronous satellites, which detect the objects while ground-based sensors cannot. So very important here. We can assume the increase in detection and database built in 1972 is a result of the Defense Support Program. The DSP served and serves currently as the US's primary ballistic missile entry warning system and its first satellite DSP-1 went into orbit in 1970. Additionally, DSP information is relayed to NORAD, and remember, DSP is now part of the US Space Force. Our second paper on space-based satellite tracking was written by Captain Bradley R. Townsend in the Air Force Institute of Technology out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and sought to revisit to determine the orbit or movement of fast walkers again, quote, satellite-based sensors looking down at the Earth's surface occasionally observe reflected light from an object passing through the image, which is moving too fast relative to the background of the image to be located within the atmosphere. These objects are commonly called fast walkers. These study comments on the 1972 Ausadax study and referred to the database origin from obtained ballistic missile entry warning satellites. Not much else to cover here, as study methods yield similar results with an inability to determine range to fast walker targets, but remember again that the ballistic missile warning satellites are mentioned here again, DSP, the Defense Support Program. Our trail with fast walkers NORAD and DSP Ballistic Warning Detection satellites doesn't stop with these two documents, however. For example, on the 6th of January 1967, Scientific Advisor to Project Blue Book Jay Allen Heineck I talked about him extensively in many videos, like my history on the UFO Stigma, discussed at Goddard Space Flight Center that NORAD tracks UFOs and has been since 1957, and that every single continental U.S. military UFO case in Blue Book files are designated as a NORAD case. And does anyone remember the Hillary Clinton campaign leaks provided by WikiLeaks? This is where a rabbit hole gets wild. Well, pouring through them you can find an incredibly interesting email chain to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. On this email from March of 2015, there is a detailed communication between USG contractor Bob Fish and Podesta. Fish was the program manager for several highly classified U.S. government advanced communication systems projects in the 1980s and 1990s. These included the White House and several executive branch intelligence agencies. And for what it's worth, just as a side note, Bob himself was vetted by Ross Colthart. But anyways, Fish makes an immediate and direct claim that quote, one of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. In fact, the main body of this email is so interesting I may as well quote the whole thing. Quote, I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them as the U.S. prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization in El Segundo, California. No one could get into the cafeteria without TS-SCI clearance. So this was not a lightweight group of gossipers. One of these times, a member of that group was really excited, said they just picked up a fast walker, I assume that same day. He described how it entered our atmosphere from deep space, origin actually unknown, but of course from the backside of the satellite and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to Earth. Not only was it going very fast, but it made a 30 degree course correction turn, which means it did not have a ballistic freefall reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So it was under some sort of control, although whether it was manned or just robotic, there's no way to tell. Towards the end of the email, Bob references a line in the 2014 Defense Support Program fact sheet to support the idea the DSP is still collecting fast walker data 24 years later. Quote, In addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. Remember this line, and remember the mention by DSP itself of the Aerospace Corporation. Fish also links to a strange, now defunct blog, which I've accessed via the web archives titled quote, Top Secret Spy Satellite Spot UFOs by Tim Schwartz. Fish strangely comments that much of the information on this site is correct. But where else can we connect DSP and fast walkers? Let's visit a case from the 5th of May 1984. An anonymous source claims to a journalist named Joe Stafula, a former Army Criminal Investigation Command, that a highly classified U.S. Defense Support Program spy satellite detected a UAP. It comes within 1.8 miles of the DSP satellite before flying below it over the Indian Ocean. It is moving 22,000 miles per hour, changes course, and allegedly flies back into outer space. Since this case is so old and there is so little published about it, tracking this down has been an absolute bear. But I have been able to find two now destroyed sites on this article. And by the way, does this case not sound very similar to the incident Fish was describing to Podesta? Anyways, both sites state, quote, this object was first spotted by the ultra sensitive orbiting U.S. DSP satellite our country uses for detailed surveillance and air defense. These satellites have the infrared capacity to spot small heat sources on the surface of the Earth and are time proven as effective monitoring devices, end quote. Which this lines up with the 1970 Duke paper, where the DSP satellites monitor small light or heat reflections off of fast walkers. This ancient blog, Deb's UFO research, provides an interesting depiction of the event through three images. Image one shows the DSP one satellite. Image two shows the fast walker headed left to right towards Earth. And image three depicts the reversal of the fast walker as it retreats back to open space. This site also provides an image of the trajectory of the fast walker by Stifula himself and states, quote, an object was spotted by a U.S. DSP satellite and tracked as it sped first directly toward the Earth and passed in front and within 15 miles of the U.S. DSP satellite. It suddenly and without impact or contact with other devices or obstructions curved outward away from the Earth. It was tracked for another nine minutes until it disappeared, end quote. Additionally, the site publishes a recreation or possibly an image of the top secret incident report summary. See the incident underlined. I am still unclear on terminology here such as the UCF listing and the ST in the field of view. If you can identify these terms to help decipher this image, please let me know and maybe we can work together on a follow up to this case. Stifula states, quote, have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that date shows an event at the same time with the same characteristics, end quote. We cannot use this evidence to prove or deny this case's story and records as true or false concretely until we can do a full analysis on an entire DSP report. This case remains speculative. Our next case with ties to the DSP and fast walkers will actually be familiar to fans of my channel yet will likely shock you, the 1976 Tehran UFO encounter. For those of you who have not seen my first grounded flight due to UFOs video, I recommend checking that out. So here's a clip on one of my all time favorite UFO encounters. The link to fast walker was done by researchers Lee Graham and Roger Rager, satellite sensor technicians at Aerojet in California. They themselves confirmed that the UFO sighting over Tehran was in fact tracked by the United States military DSP satellite. During their investigations, Graham and Rager located a computer printout from the timeframe of the Iranian UFO overflight, which shows that the DSP satellite definitely detected a quote anomalous object in Iranian airspace. After a long and fruitless venture to confirm these claims finding nothing besides a declassified paper often referenced by Rager titled, Now You See It, Now You Don't, by Yousaf Captain Harry S. Shields, I was finally able to begin to pull on the strings of the evidence Graham and Rager proposed. Within the NYCAP report of the 1976 Tehran incident, there exists a link to a long dead email chain between Brad Sparks, an early founder of CAUS, the Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, and blog owner RJ Kohen. Here Brad raises concerns about DSP-1 detecting the UFO in the 76 case and questioned whether the satellite actually captured the Mirage F-4s scrambled to pursue the UFOs instead. Spark references a quote, out of focus graphic image, end quote, that only gives the date not time of the event and states quote, 238 scans possible SR. Since DSP scans once every 10 seconds, this means that DSP scanned an object for 39.7 minutes and the SR term listed may refer to strategic reconnaissance. After going deeper, I was able to find an email chain from the now also defunct VirtuallyStrange.net dating back to 1998, which references the DSP connection in the 1976 Tehran case. This email states quote, JPEG is available at the above URL, end quote, so at this point I was finally getting close to finding the actual image. Following the source of the JPEG takes us to a 1997 blog post on ufoworld.simplenet.com, titled quote, the DSP connection. And here we get the out of focus grainy image that supposedly depicts the DSP printouts highlighting the 1976 Tehran fast walker by Graham Enreger. Guys, the only things we can determine from this raw image is a similar to structure to the 1984 fast walker case where the term UCF is referenced multiple times as well and the aforementioned 238 scans possible SR. The rest of the image is illegible and frustrating. Due to my limited graphic experience, I have tried and failed to AI upscale this image to make the rest of the text legible. Also my backwards image search yielded zero results. If you think you can help me make this document legible, please please please email me at uapgirb.com and let's figure this case out together. So there we have it, two cases connecting fast walkers and DSP, but both lead us to somewhat dead ends with insufficient data to further our investigation. I am going to keep getting to the bottom of this hopefully with one of you, but let's get some relevant updates to these cases soon. So remember back how Fish mentioned, at the end of the 2014 DSP fact sheet, quote, in addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. Well guys, the Aerospace Corporation is suspected as one of the legacy private corporations who engage in, quote, real UAP research. In ufologist Jacques Fillet's book Hidden Science 5, which accounts for Valet's journals from 2000s to 2009, he along with Kit Green, physicist Hal Puthoff, astrophysicist Eric Davis and Kristen B. Zimmerman, suspect that Aerospace Corporation alongside Lockheed Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are among the USG contractors involved with deep UFO work. And in Ross Colthart's fantastic book In Plain Sight, I would highly recommend reading that book. He writes that a source told him about an aerospace company in Long Beach, California with access to, quote, the wreckage. The source told Ross, quote, the program was controlled by a relatively small group of people, not all in government, including people in aerospace, intelligence, and corporate financial communities. The source said that the company had sprawling gardens. And the only major aerospace company in Long Beach, California that has this type of campus is the Aerospace Corporation. And remember Colthart is no slouch, he is the man after all who broke the grush story. And there is much more work to be done investigating the Aerospace Corporation that is not the subject of this video. But it is interesting to see how Space Force and DSP would be analyzing DSP data with the Aerospace Corporation, a company with possible larger ties to covert UAP study to, quote, develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today. I know it just feels like we started to scratch the surface of fast walkers and space bound UAP, but I wanted to make this video for a brief look into kind of how Space Force, USG, DOD, NORAD kind of use the terminology of fast walker to skirt around FOIA and how this isn't a new term. And we can trace back to the 76 Iran case, the 1984 DSP-1 case to, you know, possibly lead some evidence to early fast walker detection. Those two cases are of extreme interest to me. And if you think you can help me out decipher that terminology, find out where those images were actually sourced from or AI upscale them to help me figure out what the heck they are saying. Please again, contact me at uapgurb at gmail.com. And I hope you found that Lee M. Graham pretty interesting. I've actually tried to connect with him on Facebook and so that is pending. I'd like to hear more about his research into this case. And there's actually a lot of interesting things surrounding Graham and some claims he made. I've heard some people liken him to a similar person to a 1980s UFO whistleblower. So should be some exciting stuff on that if I can actually get in contact with him. Guys, please remember if you enjoy the video to like or subscribe and leave a comment what you think about DSP, fast walkers, space bound UAP and so forth. Thank you guys so much for joining and as always, I will catch you for the next video.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/Tubx-CaAaOs/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Barry J.

But a fascinating aspect of the trans-medium capabilities of these craft has long been forgotten. Until Commander David Fraver's sighting of the tic-tac, which seemingly communicated with something churning under the water's surface, military footage showing UAP entering or leaving Earth's waters, in the incredible efforts of Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet. What's up guys, it's UAPGurb, and today I want to cover the history and some famous historical sightings of one of the most overlooked aspects of the phenomenon, undersea UFOs, or unidentified submerged objects. The idea UFOs are not only operating in our skies, but also the most unexplored regions of our planet is both profound and somewhat disturbing. So let's not waste time, let's get right into it. Shockingly, the study of USOs is not a recent undertaking. In fact, we can head all the way back to the early days of Project Blue Book in 1951. USAF Major Dewey Fernet, Blue Book member, undertook one project interloper with the aid of the US Navy. The goal of this project was to investigate both aerial and undersea UAP. Regardless of serving as a sitting Blue Book member, Fernet's operation interloper was curiously an extra governmental investigation, meaning it was exempt from all Freedom of Information Act requests. Whether this was directed by USG Elements or not, I'm not quite sure. However, in 1953, interloper briefed the CIA, but the project's findings never reached Congress or the American people. Today, only three case files remain from Fernet's project, cases 26, 27, and 28. Case 26 covers US Navy Lieutenant George P. Williams, who alongside with his nine-man crew in their Navy Fleet Logistics Air Wing plane, observed a trans-medium UFO depart the ocean and traverse the skies between Kefalvik, Iceland, and Newfoundland. The object, initially mistaken for a ship, rose from beneath the clouds and approached the Navy aircraft at a, quote, terrifying closing rate. The object hovered near the air wing's port site before disappearing at alarming speeds. The object was described as elliptical or cigar-shaped, measuring a minimum of 200 feet with a red-orange glow along the periphery. The other two surviving cases do not fit our investigation today, but still check this out. Case 27 highlights the experience of a South African Airways constellation craft en route from London to Johannesburg. Near the Kenya border, the airplane crossed over the crater of a long-extinct volcano where the pilots noticed a silvery disk stationed deep within the crater. The disk took off at a high rate of speed straight up and out of sight of the craft. Next we can look at the 24th of April, 1952, where the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center is written by AFOIN-XSG, regarding the possible connection of submarine contacts. This letter addressed to one Colonel Dunn attaches nine reports of submarine contacts with UFOs, specifically flying disks, with the assistance of ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence. Unfortunately, these reports are unavailable, but what is interesting are the Navy UFO sightings listed in the 1950s. This information is relayed in Timothy Goode's book, Need to Know, UFOs, the Military and Intelligence. This information is supplied by respected ufologist Leonard Stringfield, who I covered in the Kingman Air of Zona Crash. Stringfield was informed of thousands of ONI UAP reports from 1952 to 1956. But I skipped over this mysterious sender of the nine reports, AFOIN-XSG. AFOIN is the Air Force Office of Intelligence, and we can assume that this SG is a special group. Curiously, we can look back to Edward J. Ruppel, a man I have talked about extensively, who served as director of Project Grudge and Blue Book. Ruppel stated that AFOIN was conducting a more complete investigation of UFOs parallel to Blue Book in the later uncovered Battelle's Project Stork. Ruppel stated AFOIN's technical capabilities branch and collection control branch were specific offices doing UFO related work. Was this Air Force special group tasked with investigating the nine USO reports one of the US government's real secret UFO investigation groups? To me, it appears likely. In 1979, Kufan, the computer UFO network, filed FOIA requests for information on the mysterious special group. All requests were denied under executive order, citing the national security need to maintain classification. The trail here in the 1950s goes much deeper as well. In 1954, JANAP, the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication, published Directive 146C, where both Airborne and Waterborne UFO were to be reported under service, communication instructions for reporting vital intelligence sightings, and Merrant. I'm guessing this means maritime intelligence. This meant both civilians and pilots were prohibited from discussing officially reported sightings. As service and Merrant sightings were subject to the Communications Act of 1934 and espionage laws, violators would receive a prison sentence and a $10,000 fine. And if you've watched a single one of my videos, you probably know I talk often about USAF Regulation 200-2. So I expect everybody knows that by heart, but if you don't, this regulation restricted all official UFO reporting to be sent to ATIC and not Blue Book. Well, in that same year, 1954, January 23rd, to be precise, the US Navy issued OPNAV, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Directive 3820, which required UAP sightings referenced as flying object reports, to be sent to the Director of ATIC, the Director of USAF Intelligence, and the Director of Naval Intelligence. This report, which we can find a copy of in Donald Keyho's book, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, directly cites JANAP-146C. With the implementation of 1953's USAF Regulation 200-2, OPNAV Directive 3820, and JANAP-146C, we enter the slow descent into the dark ages of UFO reporting, starting with explanations of swamp gas and weather balloons. So our paper trail here becomes relatively sparse, and we have to start to rely on claims of USO studies and experiences. We must travel all the way to 1985, where ufologist Jacques Vall\u00e9e claims in Forbidden Science Pacific Heights, a collection of his personal journals, that a source at NARCAP, the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, told him that a large collection of UFO and USO files were being stored at Norton Air Force Base. Norton has historically been associated with UAP or NHI research, such as being named by Stephen Greer and the disclosure project in his alleged briefing to Congress in 1996. But let's move on to a really curious rabbit hole from 2017. Of course, with an absence of official documentation, this story should be taken with some skepticism. But let's tackle the claims by astronomer Mark Dantonio. With Dantonio, president of FX Models, a company with naval contracts was taken for a ride in a naval submarine as a thank you for his company's contract work. While undersea, the sonar team picked up what they called a fast mover, traveling at several hundred knots. For reference, most submarines and torpedoes travel at roughly 40 knots. The commanding officer told the sonar operator to, quote, log it and dog it, end quote, essentially bury in the encounter. And years later, Mark asked a senior naval figure about the fast mover program. I bet you can all guess the response. Sorry, Mark, I can't talk about that program. These two Dantonio essentially confirmed the program's existence, especially since the figure told Mark that USOs were common and that there was a program in place to classify and log and determine the speed of them, but those reports go into a vault. Of course, remember, this is all just alleged testimony, we have no way to prove this right now. But the year of 2022 is where chatter around USO became much louder and really made its way into the public zeitgeist. I'd like to take a look at the published notes of Oak Shannon, a figure I haven't mentioned since the Wilson Davis memo video. Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Department of Energy Nuclear Physicists, confirmed the authenticity of the Wilson Davis memo, but that's not our focus for today. These notes, published in 2022, recall Oak's time at the Advanced Theoretical Working Group, held at BDM's International's McLean Secure Facility, and classified using DOE controls in 1985. These notes contain some fascinating information and I highly recommend reading them. You already know, just check the show notes. But alongside mention of some UFO hotspots such as Mount Hayes, Alaska, Shannon jots down the Navy has intelligence on an underwater UFO hotspot near Gulfo San Matisse off the coast of Argentina. And we can also look at ex-CIA operative John Ramirez, the man who made the Galactic Federations claims famous, who in 2022 claimed he had heard rumors of a relationship between the Office of Naval Research and the CIA Office of Scientific and Weapons Research slash WINPAC, the Weapons Intelligence Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center, where USO materials are recovered and transferred to the CIA. Interesting connections here, seen as there are some insane CIA UAP rabbit holes, but I want to save this for a more focused video on the topic. And now we get to absolutely the most credible figure to speak on USO, who featured on Sol's November 2023 panel, Timothy Galladette, retired US Navy Rear Admiral, former assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere within the US Department of Commerce, and former administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Here I am an ocean scientist for three and a half decades, and I sit in a lot of meetings with leading ocean scientists still today, but it just it kind of mystifies me that more people are intellectually curious about what the story of the century is, and that's these, these that are occurring in the water. On a fascinating news nation interview with Ross Coltart, Galladette has made some profound statements such as, We're being visited by non-human intelligence with technology we really don't understand, and with intentions we don't understand it all either. Now that really has surprised me to hear that from a former very high ranking flag officer in the US Navy to actually say you're stating categorically that you believe NHI, non-human intelligence, are real. Absolutely. I think it's about time that we do disclose that we, we are in contact with non-human intelligence. There is so much of interest I want to cover on the Rear Admiral, such as his Sol Foundation discussion surrounding viewing the gimbal and go fast videos, but having them mysteriously removed from his inbox. Or how in his recent tweet, Galladette comments on the Sol Cal anomaly, possibly USO related being scrubbed from Google Earth. But let's focus now on his 2024 Sol published white paper, Beneath the Surface. We may learn more about UAP by looking in the ocean. This excellent paper was written by Galladette, and besides highlighting the obvious threat to maritime security, the paper frames the importance of USO's study as an unprecedented opportunity for maritime science and the subject should be elevated to national research priorities. Galladette calls for action to uncover the unknown unknowns associated with UAP and USO's due to the concerning non-reaction of the DOD regarding unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics entering US water space. In the executive summary of the piece, the Rear Admiral makes a beautiful statement quote. Yet, however concerning the security implications of UAP are, the scientific ramifications are nothing short of world changing, pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans. And several pieces of congressional legislation support these observations by defining UAP as trans-medium vehicles. The stunning implication is that engineering, material science, and physics beyond the state of the art are needed to produce and operate these objects. This knowledge could transform such fields as air and maritime transportation, energy generation, agriculture, communication, computing, manufacturing, space travel, virtually every imaginable economic sector, not to mention defense. Another study of UAP may lead to discoveries that make those of the scientific revolution in the 17th and 18th centuries look like baby steps. Throughout this paper, Gallaudet draws attention to the massive disparity between investigating UAP operating in our skies and UAP operating within our oceans. This is especially highlighted in the abysmal Aero Historical Report Volume 1, which makes a grand total of zero references to any cases or whistleblowers having to do with USO or maritime situations. As I mentioned in the opening statement of this video, and this is really cool to see, Gallaudet mentioned the Tic Tac case as observed in 2004 by the Navy FA-18F Super Hornets where the pilots observed the UAP hovering just above roiling ocean whitewater, possibly indicating a larger UAP below the surface. Other cases highlighted in this paper include the Trans-Medium UAP, filmed in 2013 in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, captured by US Customs and Border Protection Thermal Imaging Systems. Quote, over three minutes the object appeared to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 mph. Enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 mph, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again. The SCU authorities concluded that no known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile, or human made technology possesses these characteristics or capabilities. Gallaudet also draws from a body of literature to state that USO and Trans-Medium UAP are just as diverse as those spotted traversing the skies, quote, luminous orbs, silver and gray discs, and triangular and cigar shaped objects with various lighting conditions. First lighted craft are often seen under the sea surface without ever emerging, end quote. The paper also touches on a fascinating case I have never heard of that occurred off the coast of Shelburne Harbor, Nova Scotia in 1960, and no this isn't Shag Harbor in 1967, however the two are located extremely close. This case covers the encounters of several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated in a US Canadian joint minesweeping exercise where the divers claimed to have observed two disc shaped craft on the seabed. Not only did the divers say they observed occupants attempting to repair one of the craft, but also recorded footage of the event. Wisely, Gallaudet thought this story pretty nonsensical or unbelievable until recent US military whistleblower revelations. I really recommend reading this whole paper, just check the show notes. The Rear Admiral wrote an excellent piece that deserves attention. After covering the sole paper, I would like to discuss just a handful of fascinating military USO cases that have caught my eye throughout history. In the same year of 2022, Lou Elizondo discussed a fascinating military USO encounter while being interviewed by astronaut Terry Virts. Check this out. I'll tell you, some of this stuff was absolutely riveting. Let's talk about the stuff, I'll share with you one interesting event that occurred. It's pretty incredible. You have, I'm not going to go into too much detail, I want people to know who it is. The person is kind of very cagey about this, but you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean island on a regular basis because the Navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile technology and whatnot. What will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it falls into the splashes into the ocean, it will sink and then at a certain time it rises up and we go and fetch it. We analyze it for telemetry and things like that. Long story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things as they are recovering it the first time, the missile, they're pulling up and something, what was described round and circular about the size of a small island, black, dark color starts rising to the surface. It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface. They thought, wow, that's really, really peculiar. Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this, another missile that was test fired. This time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile and this thing starts coming out of the water again and if you know about the Puerto Rican trench out there, you've talked about water that's 22,000 feet deep. It's the second deepest part of the ocean. The thing starts rising up and it's starting to come to the surface. The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope. They're doing an emergency ascent. It's absolutely panic at the disco, freaking out, what the hell is that, what's going on and as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile under water and then disappears, never to be seen again. And David Fraver's Tic Tac Encounter isn't the only time the US Navy and military has encountered these. In 2010, USN Petty Officer John Bowman saw a Tic Tac shaped object from the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson off the coast of Haiti, quote, I was staring into the water from above when a large fat white Tic Tac object, approximately 20 feet in length, suddenly appeared in my view below me, moving right and darted into the depths as fast as it appeared. I couldn't really comprehend what I saw. It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, it's forward and rapidly collapsed in on itself and disappeared and quote, Bowman reported this sighting to his supervising officer but was not debriefed and not to file a report. The officer told him that everybody sees weird things in the ocean. Everybody knows the famous Tic Tac sighting seen from the USS Nimitz in 2004, but did you know in 1991, the same vessel had a USO encounter? Petty Officer Kevin Thomas claimed to have seen a quote, huge black triangle, end quote, near one kilometer in length, lift out of the ocean and shoot vertically into the sky when he was left on deck after the ship was ordered to darken and clear decks. Thomas claimed to have witnessed no water dripping off the craft, nor sound made by the craft. The next day, men in civilian clothes appeared and interviewed Thomas on board the Nimitz asking why he was outside and what he saw. Thomas said not a peep due to fear of being disciplined. This story needs to be approached with some skepticism because full transparency at the moment, I am unable to uncover Thomas' service record. And here I just wanted to cover a handful of these USO cases. If for my next video, you guys would like to see me tackle solely a list of USO cases officially reported throughout Blue Book and other channels, let me know. I personally really want to make that video so if the interest is there, I will absolutely tackle it. And lastly guys, I just wanted to cover a series of very controversial images taken in March of 1971 from the USS Trepang. These images purport to show the vessels encounter with at least two forms of UAP slash USOs, a triangle and cigar shaped craft. Debate has circled endlessly since these photos first appeared, some arguing they are legitimate, some arguing their hoaxes, and some arguing the images are real but depict engagement with test barrage balloons. And I do have to add there are some people who think all or some of these photos are an example of Feta Morgana, a complex mirage appearing above the horizon. The story goes these images first appeared in a French magazine called Top Secret. The original scans of the images were sent to investigator Alex Mistretta. Allegedly, the Trepang station between Iceland and Jan Mayen Island in March of 1971, led by Admiral Dean Reynolds Sackett, happened upon the USOs by accident. Officer John Clica initially spotted the objects with the onboard periscope. Some of these images seem to be harmless snapshots of the objects hovering, entering, or leaving the water, while others appear to show the objects in distress, unknown if this was due to engagement with the Trepang. Well we can actually confirm that the USS Trepang was indeed in the Arctic at this time, especially near Blue Nose Arctic Circle during November of 1971, and we can confirm this was the only vessel in the region. I cannot find any information on if attack submarines carry balloons for training exercises, solely this joint USN CIA document on testing balloon launches from submarines that was conducted in 1955, so this does cast doubt on the balloon training exercise theory for me, especially due to the fact there are no live fire records by the submarine at this time. Investigator and Navy pilot Steve Murillo was able to speak to Admiral Sackett. Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take multiple phone calls, but steered away from the UFO question. The Admiral stated he did not see anything unusual on board the Trepang, nor did anyone else. He only, quote, saw ice. The alleged spotter from the periscope, John Clica, whose identity we can also confirm, was also contacted. He stated he found the investigation interesting, and did not know what the pictures represented. So these two statements essentially kill the training range story for me. We are left with likely a hoax or the real deal, but the Admiral and Clica either cannot break security oaths or were unaware of these signatures. Unfortunately, one of the best images of the lot shows signs of tampering, credit to Wim Van Utrecht for this discovery. To my knowledge, this is the only such example of photo tampering. Though he is extremely skeptical on these images, I tend to agree with the thesis of John Greenwald here, that this altered image does not discredit the validity of the other images. John states many publications will enhance photographs for print. This is done to improve visual appeal, and since the original images does indeed differ somewhat in aspect from the magazine image, I find this hypothesis to be pretty plausible. So are these images of the triangle, cigar, and possibly an egg-shaped UAP interacting with our oceans real or a hoax? Personally, I'm undecided, I need to do more investigation into this case, but the images are perplexing to say the least. Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the history and fascinating aspects of USO. In my opinion, throughout history USO have been severely overlooked until 2022 and onward. Thank you Timothy Gallaudet, one of the biggest inspirations for this video. I find that I've never ever ever anywhere seen the history of USO study covered. Now here at my channel, and probably many other channels too, we go in depth into Project Blue Book, The Robertson Panel, The Condon Report, all of these aspects throughout history of UFO being studied openly or secretly, but you never hear about USOs. So I just really wanted to touch on this fascinating aspect of the phenomenon. And if you guys want, I really want to make that kind of video on some famous and underrepresented USO cases. I want to pull directly from Blue Book and Grudge and Sine and look from there, find some credible reports. That's a video that really excites me. So if you guys want to see that, let me know in the comments below. Please remember to like and subscribe and if you think about it, join the Patreon, I'm not going to gatekeep any of my content, only pay for what you think the content is worth. And for those of you who are into the sport, how about that 300 card guys? That Holloway Gachie finish was one of the most wild things I've ever seen. I'm happy my boy Yuri Prohaska got the win. And choosing Jamal Hill aged like a gross cheese. So that didn't end up too well. Hope him the best. He's a great fighter. But let me know what you guys think about this next video and some other video ideas you guys want to see. I'm recording this the day after the Kona Blue files came out. So I will definitely be taking a look at those and reporting back to you guys. So thank you so much and I'll catch everybody next time.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/U-jrx_giINA/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Alex Mistretta</li> <li>Bowman</li> <li>Dantonio</li> <li>David Fraver</li> <li>David Fraver's</li> <li>Dean Reynolds Sackett</li> <li>Donald Keyho's</li> <li>Dunn</li> <li>Edward J.

I'm not going to go through 145 sites. Some of them are black sites. Some of them are bases, you know, about like Wright Patterson, Edwards, Nellis, Area 51, so-called. But all of them are based on witness testimony and intelligence we've gathered over the last 30 years and it's time for it to be disclosed. Recently in 2024, Stephen Greer in the Disclosure Project released their entire catalog of documents, communication logs, drawings, and other files. Love them or hate them, over the years, Greer has provided valuable witnesses a platform to speak and wrote in my opinion a truly fantastic piece of work, his 2001 Disclosure Briefing document. So while I have my problems with Greer, this document archive absolutely commands my attention. Greer's list of UFO whistleblowers and witnesses features over 700 names, many of which are redacted. Here we find names we all expect. Michael Herrera, the late Dr. Robert Wood, Richard Doty, Robert Salas, Jonathan Wagan, even Bob Lazar. But we also find 22 pages of redacted names. Some of these names are described simply as points of contact to others, but some have descriptions that might be well worth our attention. Viewers of my channel may remember UFO witnesses redacted list in which I derived the names and contacted two of these witnesses from poorly redacted documents uploaded by Greer. One such witness MS agreed to interview on UFO testing occurring at Dugway Proving Grounds while the other witness TB was much more shadowy. Today we cover the redacted entry that has captivated my attention and commanded my research for months on end. A witness I have been more than eager to cover as I believe this witness's alleged first-hand experiences with UFO reverse engineering offer crucial insights into DOD and defense contractor involvement with UFO programs. Hey guys it's UAP Gerb and thank you so much for joining me today. I am beyond excited to cover another witness in Steven Greer's redacted list. Witness 11063 who makes claims of testing UAP reverse engineer technology and craft at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Grab your pencils and notebooks because we have a tremendous amount of research to conduct and avenues to explore from two simple documents on this former wing commander at Edwards. And before we get started guys full disclaimer I have been able to ascertain this individual's identity and have tried to contact him through myriad methods. Should he ever respond and be willing to go public I will go to any lengths to speak with him. But for operational security and his family's safety I will not burn witness 11063's identity. I have also attempted to encourage this individual to testify before Congress or contact the Senate Intelligence Committee. For this project I will only be using publicly available sources no classified or hidden information will be disclosed in this video. And I would like to say I have thoroughly vetted this individual through public online resources and can confirm his Air Force station at Nellis Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and the Pentagon as well as various positions within the U.S. Air Force as stated by Greer. I first took note of witness 11063 who I will further refer to as Ed when Dr. Greer released his witness list. This astonishing entry reads quote career Air Force Nellis Edwards test director of electronics warfare group tested reverse engineer technology was at the Pentagon DOE Wing commander at Edwards contacted us in 2023 end quote unlike MSTB and myriad other witnesses no communications or files existed on Ed at the initial release of the DPI archive files. It wasn't until late summer of 2024 the disclosure project intelligence archive updated an additional section of documents intelligence briefing modules that we would get our first leads on Ed within this section we find module three under UFO crash retrievals titled quote covert government retrieval and handling ET vehicles end quote analyzing the executive summary we find some fascinating information adapted from a March 2024 oral presentation from Greer not only does Greer discuss 130 plus instances of NHI objects being downed and retrieved involving major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Skunkworks and Boeing but these operations are conducted using advanced electrocovidic technologies and electromagnetic pulse EMP weapons I do highly recommend reading through the entirety of this module as it invokes the quality of the 2001 disclosure briefing document and also makes mention of witness MS and Richard Focch a formal naval research lab senior scientist who discussed large silent triangular alien reproduction vehicles over remote areas of dugway proving grounds towards the end of module three we see our first discussion of Ed outside the witness list quote a lieutenant colonel who managed pilots at Edwards Air Force Base and is responsible for training pilots who operated man-made UFOs has expressed his willingness to share his information openly Dr. Greer introduced him to the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee where he shared information he is also eager to testify openly before the House Oversight Committee though responses from key members like reps Luna and Bershet have not yet been received having left the Air Force in 2009 the Lieutenant Colonel was extensively briefed on operations not just at Edwards but also at Nellison area 51 he believes that since the operations he was involved in were illegal he is free to discuss them publicly and is ready to disclose everything he knows in an open hearing under oath end quote it was around the time of the upload of this module Greer finally uploaded two documents under witness 11063 first let's analyze what I would consider to be the less impactful of the two documents on Ed to understand his background and motives for contacting Greer in late 2023 in presumably an internal disclosure project email an unknown individual emailed Greer stating witness Ed had been following Greer's work for some time and wish to answer Greer's call for whistleblowers this dpi employee states Ed served in USAF from 1999 to his early retirement in 2015 where he ended his career according to the email Ed additionally came from an engineering background worked with the Department of Energy and served at the Pentagon for seven years the email accurately breaks down Ed's service record three years at Nellis Air Force Base Nevada three years at Hanscom Air Force Base Massachusetts and five years at Edwards Air Force Base California in 2006 Ed was sent to Edwards AFB for the bases test pilot school it was here Ed would claim pilots at the Air Force Base are trained for unacknowledged special access programs using reverse engineered non-human technology side note Edwards is well known for its prolific and prestigious test pilot this highly selective program trains pilots navigators and engineers on experimental flight platforms originating from the Air Force material commands 412th test wing the test pilot school's mission is to quote conduct full spectrum tests and evaluations of aerospace weapons and to be the world's premier educational and training center for theoretical and applied flight test engineering end quote an additional point the test pilot school originated out of Wright Patterson Air Force Base during World War two during his time at Edwards after graduating the USAF's highly selective test pilot school Ed would serve as the head of an electronic warfare group that tested NHI reverse engineered technology in this role Ed claimed to serve as the intermediary between engineers who had direct reporting to him and test pilots when quote they had a manned craft they were testing end quote interesting to point out here according to the email Ed agrees with Dr. Greer stance on free energy systems from direct firsthand involvement in various projects a little bit of context here since the late 90s early 2000s Greer has highlighted issues of suppressed technologies and systems levied from the reverse engineering of off world technologies these technologies are famously referred to as zero point energy systems to quote the 2001 disclosure document quote we have identified insiders and scientists who can prove in open congressional hearings that we do in fact possess classified energy generation and anti-gravity propulsion systems capable of completely and permanently replacing all forms of current used energy generation and transport systems these devices access the ambient electromagnetic and so called zero point energy state to produce vast amounts of energy without any pollution such systems essentially generate energy by tapping into the ever present quantum vacuum energy state the baseline energy from which all energy and matter is fluxing all matter and energy is supported by this baseline energy state and it can be tapped through unique electromagnetic circuits and configurations to generate huge amounts of energy from space time all around us these are not perpetual motion machines nor do they violate the laws of thermodynamics they merely tap an ambient energy field all around us to generate energy end quote zero point and free energy systems are not the topic of today's video so i recommend reading the hunt for zero point by author nick cook jesse michael's video aerospace secret search for anti-gravity or even greer's 2023 documentary the lost century and how to reclaim it and it is interesting and worth noting that this internal disclosure project email states ed is in complete agreement with greer stance on free energy ed isn't the only witness to comment on zero point systems either take redacted entry 10 747 for example who is stated to be an x chairman and vp of a well-known corporation i have high conviction this company is general electric according to greer 10 747 has quote huge details and testimony regarding free energy and the military industrial complex cover-up slash suppression of these technologies no several people killed and scared to death end quote towards the end of our witness testimony internal email mention is made ed had been tracking current legislation relating to legacy program member amnesty and would be willing to testify to aero as long as kirk patrick was removed from the organization because according to ed the good doctor quote is an insider and is meant to squash information end quote this is indeed a very charged statement and one i am sure many ufo investigators will agree with based off the actions of sean kirk patrick and the way you combat conspiracy theories and and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact and science and truth so if you've got evidence for conspiracy then then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is there has been none that has been substantiated for this and everything that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when i was in that position as the director we investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from most everything was explainable through other documentation other programs other people that had talked to other people it goes without saying dr k has very little goodwill with the public like the lies and half-hearted debunks in the aero historical report volume one or aero's 2022 contracts with sandcorp a company built to plug whistleblower leaks i have even made an entire video on sean kirk patrick and his disinformation which is at this point somewhat outdated as it covered little of kirk patrick's role as an unpaid consultant after leaving aero so let's briefly cover a new revelation that supports ed's accusations of the doctor injecting misinformation into the public well in a recent us space command foyer release by twitter user tag underscore om we can find a january 2023 meeting scheduled by dr kirk patrick involving us space com and senior us joint command staff the purpose of this meeting was quote uap response and recovery and material transfer end quote the witness testimony document gives us a brief overview of ed his background and motives but our next document is where our true research can begin this two-page set of notes roughly covers a phone conversation between dr grier and ed on november 25th 2023 not only do these notes describe ed's testimony in depth but also break down his military career by year and station the document is absolutely worth going through line by line off the bat ed asks rear if he has threatened legal action against lockheed and bowing as ed was read into programs overlapping these two companies at the beginning of his air force career ed did indeed work with lockheed as a range technical contractor in the early 2000s at nellis air force base along with some other smaller specialized contractors however there is no mention of bowing to the best of my knowledge in his work history publicly we can find myriad projects and current job openings for work between lockheed and nellis air force base but there are a few of extreme interest here check out this lockheed martin case study titled the importance of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in which the contractor was tasked with updating the system used by usaf warfare center for intelligence collection and processing lockheed martin reconfigured a two-phase security classification system used by the national geospatial intelligence system yes the same agency grush was a part of when liaison to the uap task force and the same agency recently mentioned by respected journalist chris sharp as participating in undersea uap crash retrievals the system was implemented to combined air and space operation center at nellis air force base which is tasked with processing information for exploitation of time sensitive targets i can't help but speculate here although this lockheed project arose from challenges in the nellis red flag advanced aerial combat training exercise could such systems be used to monitor uap and uap crash retrievals the idea ed was read into uap programs at nellis air force base as a first lieutenant from 1999 to 2002 can possibly be reinforced later in the notes where greer states ed was briefed at area 51 s4 where quote a major said they had caught slash captured lots of aircraft end quote this small point will later become even more interesting as we learn the area 51 groom lake facility is administered by a detachment from edwards air force base california the base where ed would transfer to and conduct the bulk of his first hand work around uap programs ed states this briefing was conducted via a 30 minute video which showed inspection aircraft that were essentially invisible inspection craft what exactly does this mean is ed referring to crash retrievals or possibly alien reproduction vehicles arvs for inspection use only this reminds me closely of the story of mark mcandellish whose close friend brad sorenson allegedly saw three arvs titled flux liners that were available for cleared personnel to inspect with paneling removed to highlight hardware of the craft the linings craft were essentially invisible further supports this thesis as i have covered firsthand witnesses before that have discussed arv craft with cloaking mechanisms craft that look identical to the flux liner highlighted by mcandellish and an interesting detail according to sorenson and mcandellish these arvs were shown at norton air force base a mere 80 miles from edwards air force base if you're unfamiliar with the testimony of mark mcandellish have no fear i will cover it soon as i believe it is one of the most impactful testimonies in all of ufology greer goes on to state that at nellis air force base nevada ed worked at building 200 under the redacted name of the first commander of the 98th range wing now let's break this down the 98th range wing now called the nevada test and training range began operations in 2001 and serves as the primary military training area for the nellis air force base complex to quote usaf the nttr is the largest contiguous air and ground space available for peacetime military operations in the free world the range occupies 2.9 million acres of land 5000 square miles of airspace which is restricted from civilian air traffic overflight and quote the nevada test and training range nttr provides the warfighter of flexible realistic and multi dimensional battle space to conduct testing tactics development and advanced training and support of us national interests while also conducting department of energy testing research and development quote the nttr coordinates operational and support matters with major commands other services do e and department of interior as well as other federal state and local government agencies the nttr acts as the single point of contact for range customers and quote analyzing the nttr and its mission to create operate and maintain live and synthetic environments and integrate partners to optimize warfighter capabilities this location sounds like an ideal choice for do d and usg elements alongside contractors to test reverse engineer technology to top it off the nttr south range contains groom lake area 51 a location deeply entwined with ufology his time at building 200 at the nttr may have seen ed interact with boeing lachid martin alongside the doe which i mentioned i could find no record of in his resume circling back to the call notes greer made specific note to ed serving under the first commander right around 2001 of the 98th range wing or nttr i have tried at length and failed to find the original commander of the 98th but i would like to take a long hard look at the commander from 2005 to 2007 colonel christopher haves i find this analysis necessary as ed may have implied the 98th commander has oversight to uap reverse engineering programs colonel haves spent 26 years in the air force linked to key roles in fighter aviation his post service resume is of heavy interest here following the air force and its service in the 98th range wing haves directed global trade controls at boeing in washington dc handling trade policy and technology licensing within major government departments haves additionally led a team at raytheon technologies another defense contractor implicated with uap study here the colonel managed relationships with key usg officials such as the office of the secretary of defense and other military departments aligning raytheon strategies within government objectives the colonel also served as a special advisor on national security affairs to then vice president dick cheney who has seen swirls of rumors recently implicating cheney as a senior member of ufo programs where have offered insights on foreign defense capabilities haves resume as well as his role as commander of the 98th range wing offers us a glimpse at a possible reverse engineering program official and speaking of the nttr in greer's notes we can find a simple sentence quote ed saw man-made craft on the range was there quite a bit end quote with strong conviction we can assume the range in question here is the nttr from this statement we can also gauge that ed is claiming area 51 slash s4 and or nellis air force base has successful man-made reverse engineered craft greer then comments on ed being sent to edwards air force base in california in 2006 for range orientation where ed would go on to serve as director of redacted for an electronic warfare group referencing the witness testimony document we can assume this director role was a test director for a technology reverse engineering group we can also assume from witness testimony this station followed ed's service in edwards test pilot school what bolsters these claims from ed is the fact edwards electronic warfare group stems from the 412th test wing the exact same wing that houses the edwards usaf test pilot school if ed's testimony is true the 412th test wing out of edwards directly deals with the testing of reverse engineered craft and technology of non-human origin this would also mean the 412th reverse engineering program works in conjunction with the nevada test in training range this is one of the biggest takeaways of this entire research project if his testimony is true ed was briefed on uap programs at s4 while stationed at nellis where he was then sent to the 412th test pilot school and test wing to further this work in an air force legacy ufo program as a test director the document state ed served at nellis until 2002 and was then sent to edwards in 2006 where was ed during this gap this period of time 2002 to 2005 saw ed stationed at handscom air force based near boston massachusetts greer writes that ed worked with the massachusetts institute of technology while at handscom working on foreign military assets but only saw terrestrial this mention of mit is still of great interest to us i've talked before about the involvement of ua rc or university affiliated research centers with uap programs many times most recently with dr eric a walker head of penn states ua rc the applied research laboratory who admitted he was involved in the keksburg ufo crash incident while mit has their own ua rc operating under the us army as well the institute for soldier nano technologies whose goal is to quote discover and feel technologies that dramatically improve the protection survivability and mission capabilities of the warfighter and of warfighter supporting platforms and systems and quote the only mention i can find of relation between handscom and uap is an anonymous letter sent to Leonard stringfield dated march 14th 1975 which claimed to recount the testimony of one colonel sims a pseudonym according to the letter both handscom and mit are two of the military bases and research laboratories that perform ufo operations alongside edwards right paterson carswell los alamos sandia etc okay so ed served at edwards from 2006 to 2010 where he was allegedly formally read into multiple quote unquote advanced aircraft programs at edwards the use of the word formal here is quite interesting almost like ed's time at nellis saw him getting bits and pieces of program information while his role as test director saw a complete briefing this echoes numerous claims that uap reverse engineering programs are as if not more compartmentalized than the manhattan atomic bomb project greer writes in 2008 when director of a redacted program ed was part of a go public plan via the air force the plan was called off in 2009 to 2010 and saw ed move to the pentagon the killing of the program was done by a two star general now i have found no confirming evidence of this so-called go public plan but i have found a series of use of two star generals aka major generals that either retired as major generals or were at the time period of interest that may give us an answer one prime suspect is major general thomas k anderson who reached the rank of major general in 2009 and retired in 2013 anderson's senior role oversaw him serving as commander of the curtis e lemay center for doctrine development and education to quote the air force quote the center is responsible for the research development and production of air force doctrine and input for joint and multinational doctrine development activities and quote general anderson oversaw numerous key positions within do d such as the air staff joint staff combat command staffs nato and chief of staff and director of intelligence for us strategic command let us also inspect major general u jean haas who served as brigadier general during our window 2009 to 2010 before being promoted to major general in 2012 haas served as vice commander air force special operations command from 2009 to 2011 haas additionally acted as director for force structure requirements resources and strategic assessment as a j8 haas commanded my interest due to his extremely prestigious role within do d and station at two air force bases allegedly connected to uap programs mac dill air force base and fort belvois virginia moving on i would like to look at major general kcd blake who earned his major general ship in 2015 and served as a colonel during ed's alleged disclosure plan not only did general blake work as commander to air force installations contracting agency of assistant secretary of the air force for acquisition at right paterson air force base ohio but his most senior position saw blake as the deputy assistant secretary for contracting under the office of the assistant secretary for air force for acquisition in washington dc here he was responsible for quote all aspects of contracting relating to the acquisition of weapon systems logistics and operational support for the air force end quote overseeing support of 826 billion dollars annually although blake may have been a colonel during this plan he piqued my interest as during 2008 he served as director program acquisitions defense procurement and acquisition policy in the office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics for the pentagon there are a total of four other major generals of interest here including c donald allston h brent blake senior randy ap but i want to lastly focus on major general christopher p asano asano did not earn his major general ship until 2019 meaning during 2009 to 2010 he is the least likely candidate to have decision-making power over a disclosure campaign however his early career dovetails almost identically with that of ed and is worth mentioning in the year 2000 asano attended usav test pilot school at you guessed it edwards in the early 2010s the general would command the 412th operations group at edwards before serving as the commander of the air force test center at edwards at his senior station asano oversaw a 31 billion dollar enterprise comprised of more than 19 000 military civilian and contractor personnel across edwards aigland and arnold afb's greer makes special note to right paterson air force base the infamous location we have discussed in almost every single video i have ever done according to ed right paterson has a tight connection with edwards ed even makes an educated guess right pat's hangar six specifically held by a logics according to internal right pat documents hangar six was initially quote primarily used by the signal corps for installing radios and antennas and after the war it became a facility for retrofitting and modifying planes and quote the hangar featured several smaller doors instead of a giant hangar door which would later be used as the right field fitness center however the fitness center is located in hangar 22 not hangar six at right pat besides blueprints and images of the exterior i can find almost zero internal images reports or articles in general on hangar six this facility will be a priority of my research moving forward especially analyzing for infrastructure to support living and or deceased biologics as ed has claimed from 2010 to 2015 following the failed coming forward plan ed moved to the pentagon where according to greer he operated within research and development panel chain little was discussed between greer and ed on his responsibilities at the pentagon however one interesting note is recorded quote 34 billion dollars than 40 billion dollars to non air force authorization non blue toa and quote toa meaning transfer of authority this statement seemingly confirms statements made over the decades by numerous whistleblowers discussing uap programs being funded through usap off book black operations i will draw your attention to december 11th 2017 where former assistant secretary of housing and urban development kathryn austin fits published a paper titled black budget of the united states here she discussed 21 trillion dollars found in unauthorized spending in the department of defense and housing and urban development centers between 1998 and 2015 soon after publication the dod announced its first ever department wide independent audit fits personally believed some unauthorized funding was utilized for domestic clandestine military rnd some of legal uap programs from dod the primary testimony of ed involves first-hand work on uap programs focused on the testing of reverse engineered non-human technology at nellis air force base slash area 51 s4 and the 412th test group out of edwards air force base california as we have discussed before numerous factors including ed being briefed at s4 and then sent to the 412th for test pilot school before becoming director of the electronic warfare group where he acted as the intermediary between engineers and test pilots when the group had manned craft to test we can conclude with high confidence ed's work revolved primarily around the utilization of nhi tech to construct and test arv or alien reproduction vehicles area 51 s4 has been discussed in ufology for decades and is often immediately associated with the claims of bop lasar but what about edwards are there any other stories of uap programs at the californian base that can support or detract from ed's claims well for starters we can go all the way back to 1957 to the testimony of mercury astronaut gordon cooper cooper claimed while stationed as a project manager at edwards air force base a group of photographers assigned to photograph remote positions of the base observed a large strange-looking craft above a lake bed cooper's crew began taking films of the craft and according to cooper the craft was quote hovering above the ground and then it slowly came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes end quote the camera crew estimated the object to be about 30 feet in diameter shiny silver in color and featured three landing gear the crew got within 20 yards of the craft before it departed cooper did in fact see the film but stated the evidence was confiscated and this is a very brief summary of the story as i would love to cover it further in great detail well that was i was found i was having some camera men found the installation of a of a precision landing facility we were putting in right on the edge of the dry lake and the saucer flew right over them and put down three little gear and landed out on the dry lake bed and they went out to pick up their cameras and moved on out toward him filming and he left it off put the gear back in the well and climbed out a very high rate of speed and disappeared and so while i was going through all the regulation books and finding out the number to call and watching to report it i had to go over and develop the film the time they got back with the developed film i was on the higher and higher and higher level officer talking to me finally with the colonel telling me to you know when the film arrived at my desk to put it in the carrier pouch there would be a courier there at my office by that time already and they'd range for him to fly in our base airplane back to washington with these films and uh do not run prints etc etc etc so we stuck them in the courier pouch did you watch the film we didn't have a chance to run it i had a chance to hold it up to the window and look at it it was certainly a good film good close-up good close-up shot in 1972 we can find project outgrowth out of the usaf rocket propulsion lab at edwards a document titled advanced propulsion concepts project outgrowth sees discussion of an anti-gravity program and theoretical material to change the direction and amplitude of gravitational fields similarly in 1988 a technical report submitted under contract with the usaf aeronautics lab out of edwards discusses the exploration of the bifield brown effect explored at length by jessie michaels which allegedly converts electrostatic energy into propulsion around the same year 1988 defense contractor science applications international corporation saic a defense contractor i have directly implicated in the study of off-world technologies studied similar electronic propulsion mechanisms for edwards air force base we can also look to 1990 where journalist scott williams wrote an article in aviation week in which 45 sightings of aircraft accelerating from near hovering positions to supersonic speeds were seen over edwards air force base george air force base in china lake naval weapons center one such craft was described as triangular in shape but let's not forget the 1998 testimony of usaf master sergeant edgar foush i have covered numerous times who commented on the infamous tr 3b reverse engineered triangular craft foush claimed while working at the defense advanced research board in 1979 under the jet propulsion laboratory at edwards a full anti-gravity propulsion system was developed and a secret space fleet utilized this technology if you haven't yet please watch my video on locking martin as i discussed the foush case in much greater depth including his station at the proposed defense advanced research center while discussing the tr 3b craft foush makes specific mention graduates from the 412th test pilot school at edwards air force base pilot these reverse engineered craft many more enigmatic claims without direct evidence exists surrounding edwards the infamous base was mentioned myriad times within lenard stringfield's crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7 in ufo crash retrievals the inner sanctum status report 6 stringfield makes mention of a doctor epigoni a pseudonym for a physicist who claimed to have worked closely with oppenheimer einstein and teller epigoni stated in the late 60s early 70s he worked on something called project heaven a special projects at edwards air force base the doctor claimed a flying saucer and its crew had previously landed at edwards the craft was kept in a large hanger guarded tightly whilst occupants were carted off to a secure building for evaluation the 12 five foot tall bodies clad in silvery metal suits featured eyes of one color a nose a mouth teeth and blood similar to the appearance of oil to quote epigoni they the u.s researchers came to the conclusion that since there was no deterioration to leave them alone because another craft might come in the area and rejuvenate or reactivate them end quote the craft itself had no rivets seams or welding and was of a classic saucer design with a dome on top measuring 40 feet in diameter other scientists informed epigoni craft materials were made of materials they never dreamed could exist and could not figure out a way to gain entry to the craft epigoni stated as of 1990 project blue heaven was still active it was run by the dod and the navy had two to three similar projects the doctor's account is far more detailed and i promise we will circle back to this testimony in future projects but the landing of this craft and seemingly inert bodies reminds me closely of the craft donation theory when you say crash retrieval what do you make these are retrieving non-human origin uh technical vehicles you know call it spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed we have spacecraft from another species we do yeah how many quite a number you're kidding no the strangest detail of this testimony is the claim the craft touched down the beans walked out of the craft and laid on the ground it's worth noting and stringfield commented on this too epigoni changed the body count from 12 to 4 according to stringfield and his fellow investigator they quote agreed that it appeared that he had consulted with his superiors and was advised to alter certain key details end quote also in 1991 status report six stringfield recounts his discussions with a firsthand witness to a ufo crash retrieval 15 miles outside of edwards in 1971 according to witness debbie clayton her and her girlfriend's family investigated a crash from the sky in broad daylight reaching the craft site debbie observed an acorn-shaped craft with an extremely similar description to the kexburg crash quote we searched for markings but found only some old scratches that we could not read because it was upright we couldn't see the bottom there were no windows or seams appearing to be made from a one-piece mold if i remember correctly it was a dark grayish color with greenish highlights not a color one normally sees there was a mild heat coming from the craft somewhat like a car engine after traveling for an hour one more thing i thought was strange there was no dust that clung to the shell here in the desert dust is everywhere and clings to everything end quote according to debbie an air force car and truck arrived within 14 minutes where men with rifles ordered civilians off scene lastly i want to cover an excerpt michael schratt discovered in the files of the late stringfield which may allow us to directly connect edwards to operating arv and ny craft alongside area 51 s4 in a letter dated april 5th 1980 one mr d l dobs discussed one mh a witness identity schratt chose not to disclose mh had allegedly performed radio maintenance at the atomic proving ground in nevada during 1961 to 1963 along with top secret radio work for usaff according to mh he participated in a top secret operation at area 51 titled project red light test flights were conducted on a recovered ufo ship from none other than edwards air force base the craft was not conventionally powered and stayed silent during operation security was so tight on the project program personnel were rotated every six months mh claimed to have heard rumors of a west coast american defense contractor encountering difficulties in many of the components comprising the craft and lastly guys i want to cover a possible connection between reverse engineering programs at edwards and nella slash area 51 in july of 1991 an alleged classified nr o document leaked to the public this document informed need to know groups and operations about civilian flying saucer organizations organizing protests in nevada steven greer claimed to have given the document to admiral thomas wilson from the wilson davis memo which at the very least we can confirm the meeting between greer and wilson allegedly wilson told greer he recognized one of the entities listed and that it was run by a contractor addressed in this document includes royal ops cosmic ops mage ops magi ops multiple usaf special forces divisions in the 26th 64th 65th 527th nella's afos i groom lake and dreamland area 51 s4 aquatec and sea spray special operations group and one blackjack team according to dr steven greer inside sources including a source inside blackjack control told him of two entities blackjack control and blackjack team blackjack control is allegedly a nella's based facility participating in reverse engineering while blackjack team operates in conjunction with control but is stationed at edwards air force base so but the key facilities i want to go through and there are others this is a list um that i've updated i updated it um for the president in 09 um a very chief one is edwards air force base and there's a whole constellation there haystack butte china lakes george air force base they retired norton air force base tabletop mountain observatory which is run ostensibly by nasa and blackjack control though i had a source at blackjack control associated with the edwards related facilities but the blackjack team you saw on that list was nella's so there's blackjack control and blackjack team i can find almost nothing publicly available to research on blackjack besides a late 2010s early 2020s project between darpa the defense advanced research project and defense contractors owned by raytheon project blackjack was quote intended to develop and demonstrate critical elements of a global high-speed network in low earth orbit that satisfied dod performance and payload requirements at a much lower cost with shorter design cycles and with easier and more frequent technology upgrades and quote seen as the alleged nro document dates back to 1991 i doubt these two blackjacks connect what's going on guys it's uap gerb and i'd like to thank each and every single one of you for joining me today as we took a deep dive into ed's witness testimony now i know i discussed this a multitude of times throughout today's video but i'd like to reiterate today's thesis once more for a final time analyzing ed's credible witness testimony conclusions can be drawn of a joint reverse engineering program focused on craft of non-human intelligence existing between edwards air force base california and nella's air force base nevada slash area 51 s4 this program stems out of the 412th test group comprising the edwards usaf test pilot school and edwards 412th electronics warfare group now this research was some of the most enticing exciting and interesting i have done since working on the off-world technologies division and i would like to compare these two testimonies the off-world technologies division and the technology here focused more on singular pieces of technology and almost weapons as described by r.a. now it was interesting to see the juxtaposition between this air force testimony as the air force plants in conjunction with a lockheed martin bowing and possibly other contractors actually work on the piloting and utilization of reverse engineered craft whether these craft are triangular in shape the classic tr 3b as proposed by fauche or possibly the flux liner classic saucer shape as proposed by mark mcandalish that were housed at allegedly housed at dormant air force base 1988 i'm not sure perhaps it's both but the line that fauche states that these pilots put commanded the reverse engineer tr 3b is out of edwards air force base pilot test uh test school jumped out to me after covering him so long ago in my lockheed martin video this research was fascinating i wish we could find out a little more on ed's time at the pentagon all we really have to go off there is the 34 billion dollars and then 40 billion dollars missing in uh transfer of authorization funds off book funds this can possibly support greers and other people's thesis that many of these programs are funded through black budget operations i know that this uh program at at edwards edwards is a very populous base so if this reverse engineering program is indeed real this must be kept to an exclusively small number of personnel in an exclusively small area who knows perhaps edwards is connected to underground facilities in this region i know greer likes to say that the uh anthill facility he posted a picture of recently in the uh helendale facility are done location so possibly this is a kind of a connected area in which craft are stored after hearing ed's testimony what do you guys think i would like nothing more than to speak to ed firsthand and hear all this information from himself but unfortunately he has gone off books there is no way to contact this individual whether by phone social media or email and believe me i have tried so if greer is right and this individual has tested revealed testified revealing information he knows this testimony is indeed impactful beyond belief but has he or is that one of greer's embellishments we don't know i'd like more than anything to see this individual ed before the senate intelligence committee or at november's open hearings who knows maybe we'll be surprised to do so but let me know what you guys think about this alleged reverse engineering program at uh edwards air force base and nellis air force base area 51 again if anybody has any other further research to let me know about this i would love to know i know that uh i drew a conclusion i decided not to keep it in the video about the air force plant 42 near palm dale sightings of late and edwards these two facilities are only about 30 miles apart which uh you know very interesting i think edwards and norton are also only about 80 miles apart so this whole complex is deeply entwined to both ufo sightings and testimonies of reverse engineering programs i was also thrilled to be able to dive into the work of lennard stringfield and others to look at some more occasions i know we uh researched the debbie clayton acorn-shaped craft 15 miles outside of edward that was immediately swarmed by usaff crew within 15 minutes and the testimony of dr epigoni that one is very interesting uh relating to the craft donation theory if you don't know what that is certain individuals like david grush have discussed that some retrievals of uap are not crash retrievals these craft are just found left unattended this story reminded closely of the alleged 1957 hollamann air force base landing in which a flying saucer saucer touched down at hollamann air force base and occupants walked out of the craft to interact with usaff personnel in epigoni's case these beings walked out of the craft to lay down on the ground and seemingly turned themselves off which could possibly attest to the the theory of biological robots essentially as many people like to call the grays there will be further research that needs to be done on blackjack team and blackjack control this just rang a note in my head from that 1991 alleged nro document but more research needs to be done here thus far i can find no connections between darpa really but this to me is the jumping off point of researching usaff legacy and contractor reverse engineering programs possibly housed at contractor sites possibly housed at air force base locations so let me know what you guys think i really appreciate everybody joining me today please remember to like and subscribe uh share these videos around i got a patreon if you want to join i don't charge for any extra content i don't gate keep content all of my research is free for anybody to consume i only have the patreon if you want to support what you think the channel's worth but guys i have some awesome upcoming other projects on arvs or alien reproduction vehicles including a deep dive on mark mcandalish which i hope to do soon i know that's been highly requested and i cannot wait to do so so without further ado guys i want to thank you all again for joining me and very soon we'll be back up with another show so thank you very much guys and i'll catch you all later

Of this massive body of sightings, 258 cases reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small percentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or transmedium objects. Of course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out, 1952's OpNav Directive 3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence Center, USAF Intelligence, and Director of Naval Intelligence. So it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO. But what about the cases we do have? And what other cases that don't appear in Blue Book that span our history are worth our time? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout history. From Blue Book to the modern day to pre-World War I, let's analyze reported cases of unidentified submerged objects. And guys, today we will not just be sticking with the US, but analyzing global cases I find worth studying. As mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Blue Book cases, aka 258 reports, involved sea sightings of UFOs. And 13 of these reports can be classified as good, meeting merit standards for UFO reporting, and a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and transmedium objects. Found in the annals of Blue Book indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic from the ship Marcala on August 4, 1950. Shockingly, this case is listed by Blue Book as unidentified, and may in fact be my favorite case I will discuss today. At 10pm EDT, the shipmaster, chief mate, and third mate of the MV Marcala saw an unidentified elliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest heading northeast. Passing within 1,000 feet of the ship, the object hovered no more than 100 feet above sea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph. This object was described as ovular, cylindrically shaped and elliptical, like half an egg cut lengthwise. The object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white. All three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it passed closely over the ocean. This event lasted roughly a minute. We can also hop on board the SS city of Almaco, heading from Yokohama to LA just north of the Hawaiian Islands on November 7, 1959. Three witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water from four miles north of the ship. The light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface, and remember those three flashes as they'll come up later. The Almaco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered. Blue Book labeled this case as a meteor, but while such a prosaic explanation might be possible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water for an extended time period warrants more investigation. And if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate near the vicinity of Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June 1960. At 2334 local time, an Operation Range Vessel, co-named Whiskey, was retrieving the data cassette from a missile test labeled 1802. The small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette, illuminated by strobes and monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above. As the smaller boat got within three to five hundred yards of the strobe, the crew observed a steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface and roughly 25 degrees from their boat. This light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break over the light. The event lasted for 10 seconds and was spotted by the RCA photographer, test observer, divers of the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and co-pilot of the recovery plane. Blue Book claimed this sighting was a flare, however. It was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site. And this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo in my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data observed a massive USO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile. And speaking of rushed Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on the 11th of January 1966. Near 1,000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate Helmsman and bow lookout observed a cigar shaped object approach their ship. The cigar object glowed with an orange-yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and a body with a duller glow. The body had two lights on top and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet long and 35 to 40 feet in length. The object neared the starboard side of the ship from the horizon and then turned 180 degrees to avoid going over the vessel. It approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400 feet. After hovering for 30 seconds, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again changed directions. This incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea. The shipmaster believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search. Blue Book identified this case as the Cosmos 33 satellite decay, however, this explanation does not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes. If you would like to read more on ship-based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF on Maritime UFO and USO research in Blue Book. This stat-rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Blue Book sightings between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Of the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific. This data highlights while there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot, UFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water. Historically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports. In fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive if not more than our own here in the United States. One day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not the topic of our video today because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO reports that are indeed worth investigating. I will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO Secrets by Paul Stonehill and Philip Mantle, however, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy of note and can track down additional reporting on. Many of these cases are just stories and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified files like we do with Blue Book, so I will be doing my best to vet these cases. Let's dive into a handful of the most interesting. On October 7, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents Sea. Its radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles. The Volga's Captain Tarantyn approached the bridge to see nine bright disks moving in from the northeast. The disks arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes. During the encounter, ship comlinks malfunctioned, similar to the major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. After the disks depart, the ship comms and operations return to normal. Raising concern in the Soviet Navy, fleet admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov, known as the Likr, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic scientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to JANAP-146C and OpNAP Directive 3820. The directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. Asaza and signed by Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr Novoitsev. This case was not only discussed in Russia's USO Secrets, but also in Jacques Valais' book UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union, a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30. The link to the book, free of course, will be in the video description, so check that out for yourself. Kamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia. The almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Akhatsk from the Pacific Ocean. According to Russia's USO Secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin Solomchakov, on a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting research within a motorboat on Kamchatka Lake. Suddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of the lake, in which rose a grey-colored oval object, estimated to be 40 to 60 meters in length. The object rose to an altitude of nearly 100 meters and hovered motionlessly. As it did, the motorboat engine stalled, horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated away rapidly, restoring functions to their engine. What fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we see Kevin Knuth discuss at the Sol Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from vehicles. In the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I have heard. This information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Ziggle, one of Russia's most well-respected ufologists. On June 15, 77, the Soviet ship Novolkuznetsk navigated the Gulf of Gayaquil, Ecuador, a radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent sphere rose from the water. It flew around the ship, hovered 20 meters over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged, and dove back into the water. And with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on USOs from 2006, where we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon. I highly recommend checking out this whole documentary, and of course the link will be in the description. But one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO slash USO government documentation is Australia. The Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers, and files on anomalous sightings. In fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported, UAS Unusual Aerial Sighting, occurred on January 23rd, 1964, and describes, quote, seen at sea by crew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia. Large lights and water made compass go haywire, shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise, causing lights to pulsate, end quote. The tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO-USO encounters and certainly not missed by Australia. A report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting. Around this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings seriously. See these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included alongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman observing a light shoot up from the water, hover, and disappear. Australian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters very similar to both the fisherman encounter and our 1977 Soviet encounter. This 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and local Aussies observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height, curve and return to the oceans. Many of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes once returned to sea. We're back to our SS City of Almaco case in Project Blue Book. It is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized these could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams, however this does not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and Americans. Outside of the Australian government, the citizens of the land down under have some fascinating stories of USOs. shooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers. In 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederick Walter and Emma Flavel observed five gray oblong objects, rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast. This sighting was also observed by two railroad workers who described five white or light pink egg shaped objects, rise from the sea but with the added detail of quivering, similar to our MV Marcolla case mentioned earlier in the video. Cigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history. Around the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a case that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review, 1966-67. Private pilot C. Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing four or five mysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island. Approaching the objects from the sky, there appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow and up to 100 feet long accompanied by three smaller objects. The two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the aircraft approached within two miles. Initially thought to be whales or submarines, the men in independent sightings from nearby Seabrae Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost like they did not interact with the water. This interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the HMNZS Southland case Knuth describes at the Seoul Foundation, which oddly enough occurred near New Zealand. We all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he and his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. But I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case. What I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th century that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau. On November 12, 1887, Captain R.F. Moore of the English steamer the SS Siberian encountered a USO 10 nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland. The captain observed an enormous fireball. Rise from the sea to 50 feet, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky. At the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and most difficult to explain electrical phenomena. But as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea. In Africa, the Gulf of Guinea 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed an immense object sinking into the ocean. The cigar shaped object measured nearly 200 meters long and 300 meters wide. As the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights lit at the front and two blue-green lights shining at the other end. This case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine. However, seen as popular submarines at this time such as the early German U-boat measured solely 41 meters long, I still find this case anomalous. And now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon observed by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere. And it's worthy to note, this just wasn't an isolated incident. In fact, the Maritime Light Wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned earlier. We had information that in the ocean, in the seas, in our inner seas, there were cases of some kind of strange phenomena related to the light of water. October of 1969, the Arabian Sea. The command of the Soviet scientific vessel Vladimir Vorobyev unexpectedly woke up without any sign of fear. The instruments showed that the massive object was at a depth of 20 meters. It was still one and a half hundred meters long. They ran to the deck. No, this is not a submarine, as we thought at first. In the depths of the sea, against the clock arrow, slightly bent, there were eight bright rays of the length of 200 meters. The fiery continued for more than half an hour. Then the spot fell apart into several parts and disappeared. Two years before that, the source of light was able to be seen. It was in 1967, in the Samzalivi. The sailors of several Dutch ships then observed the rotation of huge glowing wheels on the water. And from the Glenfolle hot spring, it was clearly seen that the object that was shining on the water was 20-30 meters in diameter. What was it? The question remained unanswered. In the sea, many times, there were glowing wheels that our famous construction engineer, Krylov, called underwater ghosts. The size of the wheels is sometimes huge, up to several kilometers. And many times, they can be seen even from space. They are rarely moved, and quite quickly. The brightness of the glow on the surface of the sea is such that the glare is sometimes visible on the clouds. What is it? Without the glow of microorganisms? But how to explain the amazing symmetry and the huge speed of rotation of the light wheels? Sometimes the clouds slip on the surface of the sea with the speed of a racing car. Microorganisms cannot move so quickly. Moreover, the test of water from the wheels often shows that there are no even traces of the glowing plankton. The light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by spokes of brilliant white light. That can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air, serving as a possibly trans-medium craft. I must note, also as they talked about in the video, some attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction between bioluminescent algae and pressure waves in an otherwise calm water. However, I do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus on the existence. But let's review the earliest sightings of these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many, many more sightings of the maritime light wheel that have been observed, but I just want to recount a few of the earliest. On March 27th, 1873, the ship Adelheid voyage from Leban to Singapore. Captain Ledman noticed a peculiar, blinding, milky white light. Appear beneath the waves about two ship lengths from the vessel. Flakes of light described as, quote, flakes of snow when driven over the rocks by a strong wind, end quote. The light followed the ship traveling at four to five knots for roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing. Ledman stated he had not seen anything like this in his 26 years of maritime life. We can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia, mentioned in an 1873 news article in the Argus. An almost USO flap was experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901. An initial USO sighting was reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans, a hydrographer for the British Navy on May 15th, 1879. J. E. Pringle of the HMS Vulture reported, quote, luminous waves or pulsations in the water, moving at great speed, end quote, passing under the vulture. It was at this time Pringle noticed two objects in the east and west, what appeared to be, quote, revolving wheels with a center on that bearing and whose spokes were illuminated, end quote. Worthy to note, these two wheels were rotating in equal and opposite directions, and the spokes were about 25 feet in length. It is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water as the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here. The second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880 by British India Company steamer Patna. Captain Avern, Mr. Manning Third Officer and others observed two enormous luminous wheels appear on each side of the ship near 11.30 p.m. The wheels were, quote, whirling around, the spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship. The spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long and resemble the birch rods of the Dame School. Each wheel contained about 16 spokes, and the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter. The spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around, end quote. The men described the appearance of the spokes could almost be represented by standing in a boat and flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally along the surface of the water, round and round. The final Persian encounter with this USO was observed on April 4th, 1901, where Captain Hosean of the steamship Kila encountered, quote, Vash shafts of light suddenly appeared. Shaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea, but it was only a faint light and in about 15 minutes died out, having appeared suddenly and having died out gradually. These shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour. From earlier the year of 1880, I just mentioned, this wheel-like object was possibly seen off the Malabar coast of India on January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan. Ari Harris describes a clear night over calm waters, stars shining bright and no moon present. At roughly 10 p.m. Harris and the shift's third officer noticed a milky white circle in the sky, resembling, quote, the nebulae sometimes seen in the heavens. Approaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel to try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object and its waves of light. The last old example here I will cover occurred on the 10th of June, 1909 and was actually featured in Scientific American, issue 106-51, which relays the Nautical Meteorological Annual published by the Danish Meteorological Institute, a report on a quote, singular phenomena. While sailing through the Straits of Malacca, Captain Gabe of the SS Bintang observed a vast revolving wheel of light under the water, quote, long arms issuing from a center around which the whole system appeared to rotate, end quote. Surfacing, this wheel was so vast, that half of it could be seen at a time with the center laying near the horizon, the wheel was able to move forward and vary in speed and rotation, disappearing when the center was right under the vessel. And like our last 1880 case, these maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water. In the same Danish Meteorological Institute, there reports another instance in 1910, where Captain Breyer of the Dutch steamship Valencien was sailing in the South China Sea. Here, the captain, first and second mate and the first engineer all observed an object hovering above the water, quote, it looked like a horizontal wheel, rapidly turning. My friends, thank you so much for watching today, as we took a deeper dive into USOs throughout history. Please excuse the rash guard I'm wearing, I just got home from training, but phalanx if you're watching, I'm always open for a sponsor. But anyways guys, I got such a great reaction from my first video on USO, I had to make a follow up and show that it doesn't matter what time period we're in, it doesn't matter what country we're in, there are stories of unexplained things in the water. As far as the maritime light wheel goes, I'm pretty torn on that whether that is a craft object or possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena. I'll include in the video description a kind of not really debunk but a paper, kind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena, but still, the fact that these are seen in the Persian Gulf, in Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me, but even more fascinating to me are Australian, Blue Book, and Soviet Files. All depicting very similar experiences, tic-tac-shaped craft, slash cigars, fireballs exiting the water, fireballs exiting the water that are almost curious about the ship, egg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists, but we see multiple cases of these sort of lightballs leaving the water dancing around and shooting off into the sky or back into the water. As far as the tic-tacs go, we often see these things hovering slightly above water and multiple cases saying they're quivering or gyrating or slowly submerging under the water but not affecting the water surface similar to the case Kevin Knuth talks about. So I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena by looking in our oceans. There's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about, but couldn't really find reputable sources for, such as some Chilean incidents that supposedly in the military, a fleet of saucers approached a craft. But until then, we'll just keep digging in case files. It's a shame that there's not a lot of information at Blue Book. We can thank OPNAV3820 and JANAP146C for that, but we'll work with what we're given. If one day I can get in contact with George Knapp and see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia pertain to USO, I would very much like to do that. But where I stand now, USO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon. The fact that these craft can operate in air or under sea trans-medium objects without really changing their flight characteristics is insane to me. So if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary, it's actually really darn good. I highly suggest watching it. It does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USOs. And of course, you can listen to someone talk in a Russian accent for 45 minutes, so that's great. As always, guys, thank you so much for watching. I've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately, with the Kingman video and getting retweeted by Ross. So that's been great. I love all of you guys. Thanks so much for being here. Remember to like and retweet. Leave a comment on the video. Let me know what you think. Let me know what cases, crashes, whatever you want me to tackle next. That has to do with the phenomenon, of course. Nothing random. So just let me know. And again, thanks for being here, guys. I'll catch you on the next video.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/Yn-83KbgRN8/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Adelheid</li> <li>Ari Harris</li> <li>Breyer</li> <li>C.

Nothing too serious</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/ZFUneP18LVI/#transcript","title":"Transcript","text":"Show transcript <p>Okay. What? All right. I think we're live. Let me see. Let's check on the phone. What up, Martin? How you doing, man? We are live. Awesome. What up, Brandon? How you doing, man? What are you guys up to? I'm going to wait for some people to filter in, and then I kind of wanted to touch on some of the new interests around the Wilson Davis document and the fat rodents Chaco Martin. What's up? Hey, guys. So, yeah, we'll just wait for a couple people to filter in. We'll talk about the new Wilson Davis revelations because I also really want to touch on what Eric Davis said. And I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of that. And then the Ross Colt Hart AMA. I found it pretty interesting. Yeah, I kind of want to review two possible sources of that 2004 JSOC on program action. What's up, Bertie? I don't know if I've seen you in lives before. So what's going on? While we're gearing up, I do want to talk about if everybody can just keep Mr. Ryan Wood in their minds. As you guys probably learned about two days ago, Dr. Robert Wood has passed on. I know recently he suffered some sort of medical complications, and I know talking with Ryan, I think his father's passing came as somewhat of a surprise. So if you can keep him in your mind, and if you guys can let me know if you've watched Dr. Robert Wood's video on the DPI, but in Stephen Greer's 2001 kind of video set, you can find it on SiriusDisclosure.com. I highly recommend watching that as kind of Ryan touched on the video as a McDonnell Douglas aircraft rocket scientist. Actually, this man was incredibly accomplished. He kind of talked to his superiors. When are we going to figure out gravity manipulation technology before Lockheed Martin does? And he was given a task, met up with Stanton Friedman, but was basically denied access. So he was a big friend of Stanton Friedman. Let's go through some of these questions and so forth. Bertie, yes, almost 10k. Hope so soon, man. That'd be awesome. I can't believe this. I started this channel out. Maybe we'll talk about the origins of the channel a little bit. This is actually quite funny. Let me go through this. Will O'Malley retain? Yes, he's going to knock Marabba out in the early rounds. And then if Taporio beats, I don't even want to hear it. This man still should be champ. If Taporio beats Holloway, which I don't think he will, I'd like to see O'Malley knock out Taporio. What's up, Quitter? Bertie? Yes, sir. Hey, and Cody, thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that. But what's the most compelling evidence? Yeah, let's talk about that too. Real fast about Mr. Robert Wood. Ryan, actually, when he and I met, because before we did our video online, he and I actually had met up in person because he lives quite close to me in Colorado. I shared a coffee talk for like three and a half hours. I'm so gracious for his time. He has a lot of interest in kind of the gravity manipulation research that Ross Colthart has talked about stemming from the 50s and so on. So I hope to have Ryan back on about that sort of project. There's a really good article, and I believe the drive about the 50s gravity manipulation studies. So I'll also link that. But what's the most compelling piece of evidence the MJ12 docs are real? I might say the surrounding the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman Forest Hall memo, the Cutler Twining memo, and Nathan Twining's White Hot Report. I think those are very interesting. There's so much good information around the Eisenhower briefing document. I want to return to the Majestic 12 as well soon. I know you guys are familiar with Grant Cameron. We'll talk about him in a little bit as we discuss the Wilson Davis memo. In his files with UFO researcher Bill Moore, I've actually found some new Majestic documents I've never seen before, dated to the 80s. So maybe in a little bit when I share my screen and we go through some stuff, we'll throw that up too, because this specific Majestic documents talks about EBEs. So, you know, I don't know if you guys back earlier this year, Grant Cameron released his files. I highly recommend going through those. Maybe I can link them, including a big file set on the current project I'm working at, hoping to get out this week. We do have the, you know what, now that you mentioned that, of course we have Ben Rich, but now we have Dr. Jim Ryder, as mentioned in imminent, and Lou Elizondo. So Dr. Jim Ryder, I've actually been kind of looking into him a little bit behind the scenes with a couple of my friends. He was in the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center or Division, ATC Advanced Technology Center. On Lockheed's media stories, there are only ever two, there have only ever been two documents surrounding Dr. Jim Ryder. One of which was, one of which was a press release on some carbon nanotube material. And another one was on, another one was on, sorry, I'm trying to remember. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center and a deal with DARPA to make a more substantial satellite network. I've been here, I know, Brady, you've been here since day one, man. I remember the first video I ever put out had the Wilson Davis video. We had like, I remember I was counting up the views on that every time I'd see one of the extra view and I'd get so happy. I am so sick of all these guys with the shady behind the scenes stories we need to hear and subpoena all these characters like Davis and put off, make them testify. So all these rumors once and for all, I agree with that in terms of Eric Davis. He seems to be very selective when he likes to weigh in about the phenomenon and so forth. Eric Davis will stay quiet for a very extended period of time and then just come online to say that Lou Elizondo is fooey and something like that. I'd like to hear more about him and as we'll talk about in a little bit, it's interesting to hear him comment on the Wilson Davis memo. You know, even in his comment, there's some stuff that, you know, at least talking to James Rigney, the man who kind of brought the memo to Grant Cameron is a little inaccurate. So I would like to see Eric Davis subpoenaed. Jimmy Shoe, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I really appreciate that. How do you think the Lockheed team killed the JSEC guys training or exotic equipment? Well, we will dive into that in just a little bit because as you know, I think a lot of this is getting connected with John Stewart and his supposed 2023. I think it was December 2023, but I have the files up. We'll go through it on the screen. We'll actually go through the whole exchange that John Stewart posted. But remember, remember this, remember Michael Herrera's insider submitted a document that was supposed to be a play on Dobser similar to secret machines by Tom DeLonge. This manuscript called Sentinels of Ether covers a blue on blue black program team killing JSEC members in 2004 in none other than Koyame, Mexico with conventional weaponry. So we'll talk about that. Yeah. So there was an experimental in the submarine in the fifties or sixties that used magnetic fields to operate and wasn't a classified project. I haven't heard of that T hammer. If you have a link, I would really, really like to go into that. You like that, pal? I know you like that. My lady got that for me. It's signed by Volk and everything. So that was a true treat to get and this is going to be the centerpiece. I have a couple of other things to hang up. I got a Joey made me a custom printed logo. I need to get that up and have another Bob reactor drawing. And of course, I have the framed Michael drawing. I got to get up Michael Herrera's when he drew the ARV. So I need to get get that up. Will you ever do a video? Yeah, absolutely. I read the 4chan whistleblower a lot. Any of you guys who aren't familiar with that, the crux of his argument or testimony is that deep underwater, there is a basically purpose built UAP production craft hamburger shaped. I believe it is. It's enormous. And apparently this builds UAP to spec and part of the reason that UAP is crash, according to this man's testimony is this this custom specking machine doesn't really care what happens to the to the craft. So yeah, I actually really want to go through that line by line by line because there's so much interesting stuff there. Everything from talking about orbs and how he says the underlying structure behind these orbs people see is almost like a like a hammer shape, right? If you if you've read that to the underground basis, he touches on implants. And of course, implants are kind of the big ticket item now with Lou commenting on them. Then speaking of Lou, what are you guys thinking of imminent? I still haven't read it yet, if I'm being honest, I got a lot of other projects I'm working on. I do hope to talk to Lou soon. So if that's the case, you guys, my community, let's bump heads and let's figure out how to talk to him different than all of these from his Joe Rogan appearance to his all of his other appearances just talking about imminent and kind of the atyp all that stuff. I would like to dig into the origins of that a little bit more if I talked to him. And I would also like to talk more about crash retrievals and so forth. Of course, in imminent, he talks about the December 6, I mean, December 1950 crash retrieval near El Indio Guerrera near Del Rio, Texas. Those of you will know that that is only mentioned in the Eisenhower briefing document. So that could be a huge validating piece of the majestic documents to find out a little bit more about that case. So signed by Volk. Yes, it is. And bought by your lady. Yes, it is. We are a Volkanovsky household. She knows that whenever it's time for Volk to fight that I'll need complete silence because if he loses, which he hasn't because anytime he's lost, it's been CGI. I'll have a mental breakdown. So Snapple, how did you, how did I not find your channel before? Insanely, I appreciate that. I really appreciate that. We're still early, man. We're still just starting up. I think first video was in mid to late January and that was on the Wilson Davis memo, which is very timely. If you've watched that video, I think I was extremely ill when I made it, had a nasty cold and was working on a like $10 Amazon mic. So it sounds horrendous. I don't think there's any music or real production value. I don't think I showed my face in that. So, you know, maybe at a year, we'll revisit that topic and get a, get a bigger type of analysis on the Wilson Davis need to dive more into Lou's relationship with Bigelow. Yes. And Bigelow's plan to receive materials given from Lockheed Martin as highlighted in Kona Blue. So I think that's a great one. If any of you guys have questions, so I'm not saying anything set in stone, but if I get to talk to Lou, if you guys have questions that branch out a little bit from his regular media appearances, let me know and I'll kind of factor that in. Again, if you weren't here yet, I do plan to talk more about crash retrievals. I sent you a Gmail. Are you possibly, I'm super behind on my emails. I'm sorry, guys. I have so many to go through and I try to respond to each one very thoughtfully. So if I haven't read your email yet, I promise I'm getting through the list. I'm so sorry. I know a lot of other productions have like a team or moderators. It's just me on this and that's kind of how I liked it. I want to make sure I interface and speak to everybody here what they have to say. So if I'm behind, I'm very sorry, guys. Big dog. Hey, Lou, did MJ12? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to ask him straight up. I know Lou likes to answer questions he can't talk about in a bit of a roundabout way. I don't really kind of confirm or deny anything or even give the classic intelligence line like I can't comment on that. So I would like to figure some good ways to structure subjects such as that. A Volk poster. Your girl have a sister. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Spectre you the man. Thank you very much. Volk should have been double champ. Pride rules. Don't get me started on that. Let's see the difference between Volk and Islam in the fifth round and the second fight with CGI. Is there any known case of a UAP crash in 2004? I know that I know there is the Tic Tac case, but that's not a crash. That is a good question. And like we'll talk about we have two origins and two kind of stories surrounding the 2004 JSOC team. In John Stewart's source, they talk about a crash retrieval in the Sentinels of Ether story. It talks about trafficking humans. So I'm not quite sure. But I again, I'd like to pay attention to the Sentinels of Ether because remember that location in which this event takes place. Kuyama, Mexico. And we have covered a case with a story of a team that a Mexican national military team that died trying to transport the vehicle. It does. I hope I've answered. Yes, I have answered your priority. I'm very sorry if I'm slow on them. So Pina Davis put off Elizondo Sheehan, Nell Mellon. I think Nell is one of the most interesting people to talk to about this topic. I have myself, I've spoken to Chris Mellon a few times. I tried to invite him on for an interview. He had to decline for the moment. Hopefully we can get that in the future. I would really like to hear more from Chris Mellon. So do you have any comment on Hans Kamler? He was in charge of the Nazi secret weapon and only was recently revealed, was taken into custody after US custody. Yeah, where did, hold on, where did I hear that? I was talking to somebody. Yes, I was talking to somebody about this in terms of. Yeah, I was talking to a friend about this, that there are some documents stating that Kamler was actually alive. I think this relates to a supposed Nazi base that was explored post-World War II near the Czech Republic that was revisited about 40 years later. I have to check my notes on that, but that is ringing a bell. Andrea, I love your videos. I've got my mom on to them. Thank you. I hope your mom enjoys them. Structure question. Lou, if someone kept D, I don't know, any alleged recoveries during his tenure with ATIP? Yes, that's actually a great question. The only one I can really think of is the 2008 Needles, California crash. And that would of course be right at the time he has joined ATIP. That is a case that was covered by George Knapp. I would like to cover that in the future. There's not a ton around that case, but I know George Knapp in his reporting commented on some really interesting kind of military presence around that time. Again, if you haven't heard of that case, it's Needles, California 2008, and I will cover that. Toby Milo, thank you so much. Would love to see a collab with you and Lou or you and Ross. Love to see Michael back. Tim Gallaudet likes your stuff. Have him on. Ross is still that dude. I'll tell you that much. I've reached out to Timothy Gallaudet. He is not doing interviews at the moment, maybe in the future. I'd like to have Lou on. I'd love to talk to Ross. And with Michael, I'm still investigating his case. So if there's new stuff to cover, of course, I'd love to talk to Michael again. Mrs. Floyd, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. And if young Hannah is watching, tell her I say hi. MJ12, reworded question. If someone wants to keep digging on MJ12, would they eventually hit pay dirt one way or another? Good way to put it. I like that. I like that. All right. Peps per-speak cautious. I can't. You guys know I can't speak. Did you hear anything from the insider who manages multiple use up facilities about using PLFs and psychotronics to fake alien abductions and blame them on ETs? No, no, I did not. But however, referencing the Stephen Greer DPI archive, there is witness. Let's see if I can get this out of my head. 10892. 10892 that talks about being on a retrieval team at Nellis observing a sunflower shaped NHI craft that had landed and also fake PLF. If you guys don't know what a PLF is, that's a programmable life form. This person in the DPI archive number 10892 alleges that after his time on a retrieval team, he encountered a programmable life form in a fake abduction. I have all of those files downloaded because we know Stephen Greer in OPSEC, so I don't know if those operational security, I don't know if those files are going to be taken down. But so I would like to dive into that case and give it its due diligence. The documents came out in 2021 that show Hans Kemler was taken into custody. The OSS agent who took him into US custody said to his son, Kemler had knowledge of weapons that influenced the Cold War in future. Yes, and that was the correct me if I'm wrong. And if you're on this subject, that was the location in the Czech Republic where the Nazis supposedly stored some art precious cardio and possibly weaponry. Well, I do a video on the UAP DA closer to December. Yeah, I probably should at this point seen as I reference it almost every video, especially the line about legacy programs, the 1954 Atomic Energy Act and classifying UAP materials as trans classified for nuclear materials. So I would like to do that. Is the control group headed from NATO outside US? That's a good question. There is a lot of there's a lot of interesting roots to go down to say that the control group handling the UAP issue issue isn't necessarily tied to one nation. If you remember back to 2023, we have Canadian politician Larry McGuire, who wrote to the Canadian Defense Minister requesting to sort of start to divulge UAP information due to the collaboration effort between five eyes nation on the UAP issue. So we at least know outside of NATO, there's sort of a five eyes effort to study UAP, whether the program, whether that means the program, it extends to all five nations or primarily operated on the United States for quasi national. I'm not quite sure, but that's a great, great question. Did you see Eric Davis admitted on Facebook? Yeah, we're about to talk about that. Mr. Ben, I cannot wait. That's very, very excited. The Wilson Davis memo was my first ever video, so I'm happy to revisit it. Who blazing? I don't know, man, I wouldn't be able to speak if I was blazing. Max Parr, thank you so much. You're one of the best researchers out there. So happy you spend hours you do dedicated to this. What's your opinion on and you are own national underwater reconnaissance office BTW. So thank you, Max. I really appreciate it. The kind of USO underwater naval aspect of the phenomenon is something I am going down deep rabbit holes to research. If you watch my off world technologies division, I have studied a specific naval center. I don't really want to talk about and other naval centers that put to mind that sort of the Navy has a massive vested interest in UAP technology exploitation program. Or the study of USO. Earlier in my research, I would solely really only focus on the Air Force and mostly Air Force projects. Of course, the Air Force paper trail and UAP is so simple to find. You can just go back to the 50s and look at USAF regulation 200-2. You can look at any sort of USAF response to any sort of UAP discussion. But I'm really starting to take a harder look at the Navy. So with the Navy comes analysis of any sort of underwater reconnaissance office. Any sort of alleged underwater bases as well. I was actually talking to Ryan Wood about this. In his research, he has come across two really interesting spots underwater. One off the coast of Florida and one off of Catalina Island in California. So as we move further with this channel, I know I've done the two USO videos. I really want to dive into more about kind of the Navy and any sort of underwater effort in relation to the phenomenon and USO in particular. What do you think of the Phil Schneider story? I haven't. And thanks again, Max Parr. I really appreciate that. Guys, Max Parr is a good friend of mine. I really appreciate everything he does. He's a great dude. What do you think about the Phil Schneider story? I haven't paid. I haven't done it. It's due diligence. What I do know is that Phil Schneider claimed to have experienced a firefight in underground tunnels with NHI. And I think fellow soldiers he was with were turned into some sort of goop or just faced horrific weaponry. And I know he also had a very mysterious death. Now, that is the extent I know a Phil Schneider. I would like to look at him someday, you know, maybe he'd be a candidate for a UFO whistler's blur video. I'm not sure yet. I always admit when I don't know something that right now my knowledge on Phil Schneider is not great. Interview with Danny Sheehan might be fruitful. I would love that. I don't know if I could talk my friend Jesse Michaels though. He put out that interview with Sheehan and that's the best. Now, there is a good chance that very soon Mr. Michaels and I will be together. So I'd love to maybe just have a discussion with him. Maybe record it. And maybe we could talk to Jesse about his experience with Sheehan. So I think that'd be great. What does Brady say? Anyone who has checked out the old interviews on Greer's channel, it's really missing out. I 100% agree. Anybody who's listening right now, please go to... No, I got the website wrong earlier. Go to DrStevenGreer.com. Up in the banner there's a link to witness testimony. There you can find everything from Philip Corso to Robert Wood to... I think you can even find like Carl Wolfe there and so forth. You can find a ton of interesting interviews. Programmed life forms. They are clones using real ET DNA from down to UFOs. They clone the beans and put some advanced tech in their brains to control them. That is an avenue I'd really like to explore. If you have some documents or just kind of research avenues on PLFs, please send them to me. UAPGrever.com. I'll be better about the emails. I'd really like to learn more, especially as I look into witness 10. 10, 8, 9, 2. And again, if you want to look at a witness who spoke to Greer about PLFs, 10, 8, 9, 2. Jim Shoe, I love you too. I just got done with a skinny bob, an alien deep dive. Do you believe either of those are legitimate? I have not done the due diligence into either video. I know that the alien interview is kind of Jon Stewart's jam. I'll let him do his thing. I got to... I think he's got an interview coming out in December. So I'll reserve judgment for then. The skinny bob, I know that's floated around. I know it's such a contentious thing, but correct me if I'm wrong. I think some people are inferring that Ross Colthart alluded to skinny bob being a... maybe skinny bob or other footage in the public domain being legitimate. So correct me if I'm wrong. Hans Kamler must have had knowledge about the Magenta 1933 and maybe Germans moved it to Skoda Works. Okay, yeah, and this might be Skoda Works I'm thinking of. Speaking of the 1933 crash, I know two guys that are excellent and have so much knowledge on the 33. So if you guys want to see a revisit of that, this guy has so many connections to Alan Dolos and so forth. I'd love to revisit that. Do you think Eric Davis would testify? I don't know. Maybe he has behind closed doors, but I really don't know. I really don't know. Okay, let's see. Let's see. The Wilson Davis is huge confirmation of the fact that Steven Greer... Yes, thank you. I know people have been talking about that lately. This is a confirmation that Steven Greer in 1997 did brief Admiral Thomas Wilson, a deputy director of the DIA and other politicians on what we can assume is the disclosure briefing document from 2001. If you guys haven't read that, I'll flash it on screen in just a minute and we can talk about that as well. It's been said that every deep water deployment that has a nuclear payload has some type of UAP encounter, every single deployment. That brings to mind Lou speaking recently of the... What was it? Hawk missile? No, I can't remember what type of missile, but in a retrieval recovery to find the cassette for the missile telemetry data, a massive UAP rising from the surface and essentially taking the missile. So that's interesting. You know what case that stuck with me when I covered USO? It was the case of the... I think it was a Tic-Tac in 1950 recorded in Blue Book. That was like a Tic-Tac or Ovoid shape. I don't think quite Tic-Tac. That was just hovering above the surface almost turning the water. That was almost like vibrating very fast. For some reason, that particular USO case has really stuck in my head. Phil Schneider was very sketchy. His death was very sketchy. We got to look into that, guys. I think one time I want to make a video just talking about suspicious deaths of UAP adjacent individuals, whether that be researchers or whistleblowers. What comes to mind is James E. McDonald as a primary person I want to talk about. Two cents. Thank you very much. Criminally underserved curves, one of the few genuine nuts and bolts reporters out there. I really appreciate that. Super thanks from Miss Hannah Floyd. Thank you very much. For those who don't know, this is my lovely girlfriend, C.H. When is the program coming out? Hopefully soon. I know Jesse Michaels has actually watched the program. I think that Robert Hastings has as well. Robert Hastings wrote UFOs and nukes. Hopefully soon. I know James Fox has just had another kind of investor on the program. I am beside myself excited to see that. I really want to watch. All right, Max Barr. Isn't it fascinating? I wonder what underwater assets we're going to be considered for ATIPS Project Interloper. Yes, for anybody who doesn't know, Project Interloper is Lou referring to kind of entraping UAP with kind of large nuclear signatures. October, November, according to UFO Twitter. Okay, let's see. P. Is this hobby just our way of making the world more exciting after decades of this and an entire planet that could present evidence? There is still nothing but stories and debunked videos. No, I do disagree with that. At this point, at least to me in my research, I don't really factor videos and I know I've covered two videos in the past, but I'm moving away from that. I think that endless debate is going to circulate around videos. But I do think even the conversation is expanding so much with Lou Azzando, David Grush, but there is a massive, massive, massive, provable trail of a UFO cover-up, an interest in UFO from USG and other military sources from at least the 1930s for factoring in Magenta. The difficulty here and why we're stuck with so many stories is disinformation around this subject has been so complete and successful, it is so difficult to unwind this entire topic. This brings to mind stuff like OPNAV 3820 Air Force Regulation 200-2, which would restrict UFO reporting to certain channels to skirt the balance of Blue Book. This brings to mind J.L. and Heineck in Blue Book, which would discuss away UAP cases as nothing more than swamp gas or weather balloons. The famous case there, of course, is the 1955 case where many people in Michigan saw craft that J.L. and Heineck famously said was swamp gas that even at the time Senator Gerald Ford took an interest in. And all of this extends even towards the modern day with Arrow, right? We have the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1, which demonstrably lies about some of the witnesses there. For example, Michael Herrera, it discusses Michael Herrera seeing an extraterrestrial craft in American block ops team. So even today in 2024, there are official lies by USG elements about the phenomenon and about this topic. So there is a map and let's not forget the Robertson panel, the Condon Report. Remember in the Condon Report by Edward Condon out of CU Boulder, which states there's nothing to UFOs, there's nothing there. There are multiple cases in there such as a 1955 case from an RB-47 jet, which multiple jets in formation saw, I think, a disc shaped UFO. It was caught on visual and radar and so forth performing insane maneuvers. And the Condon Report takes a sighting such as this as whatever, it's nothing. So there's a very provable cover up here for 80 years. What it is, this is what this is our purpose here. And we can even look at Roswell. Remember Roswell case closed the US Air Force debunk on Roswell. It didn't show up until 1994. Roswell occurred in 1947. In that 1994, the US Air Force labeled the Roswell Weather Balloon Project Mogul Flight 4, which was then proven to not have even taken off on the day it was said to have taken off. And I think Roswell explained the bodies away as dummies, which weren't introduced into official USAF service into the 50s. So there's so much sketchiness around this topic. I could ramble on forever, forever. Big dog, miss talking with you and Max, get back in. Let's chat with Max. So what do you think about Eric Mitchell, who Dr. Michael Masters had a very intensive, I don't think I might not be familiar with Eric Mitchell. Please enlighten me. Pete's best. Thank you very much. UFOs and NATO Richard Hall interview was first hand witnesses of finance and your team. Have you seen it many leads? When is the Marshaise video dropping? I have not seen that Richard Hall video, but I'm going to right now. Full transparency. I got two projects I'm working on right now. One of them is the good old Kecksburg 1965 crash retrieval case, which is a fantastic case. I can wait to talk about it. I'm trying some fresh research avenues on that case. Some things that haven't really been explored too much that have been in other kind of researchers files. Okay. Trollmama, what can we do to support you? Just further the UAP discussion. That's it. Continue to talk about UAP. Inform your friends who think that this is just a conspiracy and lump in the UAP phenomenon with Bigfoot, ghosts, ghouls, guests, demons. Explain. Explain the facts behind UAP. That's kind of why I started this channel. Talking about everything from Robertson panel to the creation of Blue Book sign grudge, the players in the 40s and 50s and so forth, early signings, Blue Book signings, USO signings and so forth. Take a couple of hours to answer. Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll do that this week. Absolutely. When I interview Dr. Stephen Greer, I absolutely would interview Dr. Stephen Greer. That would be very controversial, but that is somebody who I would like to speak to. Absolutely. Again, we have our opinions. Everybody has their opinion on Dr. Stephen Greer. I still will not downplay some of his previous efforts in the world of UAP. Absolutely. Big dog, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Let me get through these and then let's touch on the Wilson Davis memo. Correct. Was that UFO and ET UFO or man made ARB? If you're talking about the Michael Herrera in the Aero Historical Report Volume 1, from time number one, he thought that was a man made vehicle. James Forestall getting thrown off the building. Yep. I think Ryan would have some good stuff to speak about too on that. Of course, Dr. Mack as well died in a, I think like a really sudden drunk driving accident. Dolan, I think Dolan has a book coming out about USOs and I would really like to talk to him about that too. Dolan's just fantastic. Dolan's one of the best of the best guys. I really look up to him. What have I missed? Nothing yet. We're just answering questions right now. Everyone's asking great questions though. That's why we get through this. Can you ask Lou about the tripping photos? Yeah. Actually, that's great. Yeah. Absolutely. What's up, David? Have I? No, I have not. I think the people I want to talk to right away, just researchers, Grant Cameron, Richard Dolan and a huge one, Michael Schrat. I'd love to talk to these guys. There's plenty of other researchers I'm in contact with, but I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with them. So because Libby, I was kind of baiting a Facebook post the other day about UAP USO and the only people to respond like it besides Rando 30s was my active Navy friend from high school. Interesting. It seems on Reddit and other platforms we're starting to get a lot of Navy personnel talking about sightings. I think there was on Reddit about a Navy cook the other day who talked about his USO sightings. I can't really remember it. I only glossed over it, but he saw something rising out of the water. What do I think about the Nazca mummies? The Nazca mummies are very interesting. I will be interested to see further research on them. I know there's a website. I can't remember what it's called, but you can actually view the 3D scans of the mummies, including the one that supposedly has a fetus inside. I know there was some claims that a lot of these mummies were like a goat head or something or animal parts stitched together, but I think there's been some research to kind of downplay that. Again, I'll need to get a better understanding, so I'll continue. I saw a video about a PhD building a nuclear honeypot to draw in UAP. Yep, Mr. Interloper. Okay. Please send your thoughts and prayers to UFO researcher Nicole Sackatch and Courtney. Yeah. I know I've actually spoken to Courtney. Courtney is wonderful, and I have heard that she has faced intimidation and threats for some of the stuff she's done. So yeah, I have heard of that. So yes, keep her in your thoughts. Then thank you so much. I appreciate that. That means the most to me. I really, really, really appreciate that. Mr. Harry, cute dog. What do you think about the Greer files? What do you do with the Greer files? Like or not, you went for the date. The Greer files are not done. There's a lot. Actually, there's a lot more I'm going to cover from the Greer files. Everybody knows UFOs are real. That's not the debate now. Who's piloting them? Yes, I agree. Who's piloting them and who has them? I'll write directly, Dr. Eric. Okay. I'm writing down Eric Mitchell, sir. Thank you. Let's see. Which is a question that has been answered decades ago by Greer and other people like Ben Rich confirmed that UFOs are of two types, ET and manmade UFOs or alien reproduction vehicles. I have started to move forward tremendously in my outlook towards the possibility of ARVs and manmade vehicles derived from extraterrestrial tech or just non-human tech in general. I am starting to really agree with that picture. Sorry. Let me get through these. David, Dr. Banevard Bush, the little I've read on him shows no science-fontological shock. He seemed to have pushed out of government work by 1950. If he was the head of MJ-12, it wasn't for long. Yeah, quite possibly, but remember from the Bowen manuscript, this was in 1962. That was sent to the DOD for review from author Bowen. That was returned in 1962 with handwritten notes from Banevard. He was still fluttering around there. Mark Streik. People still can't decide whether NHIs are ET-dimensional. Yeah, I agree. It's very divided. Of course, that's probably a conversation that's going to continue to tumble around for a long time. I'm talking about everyone. Is it ET or ARVs? Yes. We can start to build a database of flight characteristics and craft. Maybe we can find a demonstrable difference in kind of acceleration mechanisms, sound output of craft, and so forth. Zach, what's up, dude? I've ever listened to Ray Bosch. He's a pastor who the Collins Elite talked to. No, I haven't. I was talking about the Collins Elite with somebody today. I'm absolutely going to chase that down. For anybody who doesn't know what the Collins Elite is, this was referenced by kind of Lou Elizondo and some of that other crew who talk about some people within the USG who are basically terrified to investigate this phenomenon because they think it's demonic. I'd love to kind of really understand the thought process there. I'd really like to go down that rabbit hole. Shrat is a hero. He knows about the man-made UFOs. Shrat is excellent. If you guys don't know Michael Shrat, he's a CAD designer. He's worked with so many witnesses to kind of recreate images of their encounters. And he has covered a lot of cases that deal with UAP that I've sometimes even utilized a human pilot. Jangi Squint. Oh, dude, your profile picture is nasty. But thank you very much. I really appreciate that. The Ivan 0135 videos. I think this is skinny Bob, right? I was asking if anybody can tell me with kind of further confidence if this was... Ross Colthart was alluding to this video. Who is this Dolan guy? Richard Dolan. Please go to his channel and look at some of his books. He's fantastic. Richard Dolan is one of the best UFO researchers out there. Do you know when the program Insiders Book Sentinels of Ether will be published in full? I do not, but I have asked the same questions because I would like to read more. Have I looked further into Draper, Gaither, and Anderson and their connections to the SAGE program, MIT Rad Lab? Max Barr? No, I haven't. And I know when Max Barr drops a line of inquiry, guys, you listen. So no, I'm writing that down, man. I really appreciate that. I actually have no idea. So that's fantastic. I appreciate that. Radle, holy crap. Thank you, Radle. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that, especially the Volk poster looking out. That's incredible. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's the best. What do you make of Lou Elizondo's claims regarding excision of a technological device and implant from a U.S. servicemen who experienced a UAP event? I think that the implant has been a territory I have been a little afraid to go down. Of course, there's just that and what's it called? Abductions or they can just be so hairy. What I need to do here is now return to the sort of Dr. Lear and his kind of extensive work on supposed implant removal. So once I kind of looked on that, I'll have a way better kind of understanding of this. But I found it fascinating Lou would talk about that with Ross, especially the implant. You are really cool and doesn't afraid of anything. Thank you, Peter. I appreciate that. I'm afraid of a lot. Black Ops guys showed up at my house and threatened me not to talk about this again. I'd be pretty dang scared. But thank you. YouTube.com slash Richard M. Dolan. I highly recommend checking him out. Would you recommend interview Nick Redfern? Yeah, absolutely. Nick Redfern is always really interesting. If you guys listen to the podcast Mysterious Universe, he is always referenced on there too. So absolutely. Yep. Dr. Lear has some awesome work on implants and that is going to be the next source. Okay. Shall we discuss the kind of Wilson Davis stuff now? Let me figure out how to share my screen guys. Present share screen share screen. Let me window entire screens. I've never done this before guys. I'm still a bit of a novice share. Okay. So here we have from the other day. This was from a private Facebook group that Eric Davis is in. And I believe since then, of course, I haven't been able to confirm this. But I think since then he has left this Facebook group because as far as I know, this was supposed to be a private endeavor that was leaked. But Eric Davis, if you don't know, let's start with an introduction to the Wilson Davis memo. How about that? Because I know anybody watching this channel probably knows what the Wilson Davis memo is. Let me just pull up the file. We'll just do like a quick 15 second, probably like two minutes actually. We'll just go through the memo real fast. The Wilson Davis, sorry, I have so many files. Wilson Davis, Eric Davis meeting with Admiral Wilson. Okay. Good. Yeah. So the Wilson Davis meeting recounts a meeting with Eric Davis and rear Admiral Thomas Wilson. The parking lot of EGNG in Las Vegas in 2002. And these, of course, are the meeting notes. This is following a briefing from Dr. Steven Greer in 1997 that he gave to select members of Congress and other individuals. So one of these being Steven Lovekin. If you guys remember the person I covered who talked about a, I really hope so. I truly hope so. And maybe because mom's from discussed and other world technologies division. But anyways, back to the Wilson Davis memo. If you guys, I recommend watching my video on the Wilson Davis memo and maybe a slog to get through. I'm sorry. It's not my most exciting work. I'm sorry. I will revisit it. But if we look through this memo, it recounts meeting notes. And this is apparently about Admiral Thomas Wilson investigating the UFO program after being inspired by his discussion with Steven Greer, Luke Shan and others. And he is Stonewald. Apparently this program was embedded within special access programs, multi tiered. What is really interesting for me to look into now that this memo has almost been confirmed by Wilson or Eric Davis is the discussion of the project keepers. Of course, this is Commander Will Miller. I've talked about him quite a bit. Commander Will Miller. Let me just find the exact line about the keepers. Because there's just so much. I don't want to make this a full Wilson Davis video. But I really recommend kind of watching my video on it because we kind of go through a to Z of the Wilson Davis memo. But yes, okay. And the keepers of the program, I forget what they're called. I'm trying to think, but one of these, the watch committee, that's it. Comprising the watch committee is a security director and I say retired CI expert, a program director and a corporate attorney. And these are the people Admiral Wilson met with and was kind of Stonewald from looking more into the looking more into the project. So the program manager directly said that the uap program doesn't fit into any weapons program Intel program spec ops or logistics program. It was a reverse engineering program something recovered years ago in the past. Is this magenta? Is this rock? Well, is this Kingman or is this multiple? I'm leaning towards multiple craft. So within the within the Wilson Davis document, this goes into further about kind of what the program says. The technology is not from this earth in this document. I think MJ 12 is also. Yeah, Miller Miller also asked about MJ 12. I can't remember right now if if whatever his name if sorry, Admiral Wilson and Eric Davis, my mind's kind of spinning right now. I'm sorry guys for any mix ups. But what is interesting here is for Thomas Wilson to talk about Corso Philip J Corso if you guys haven't read the day after Roswell. I would highly recommend reading that mentioned the SAP OCC and the reorganization of SAP SAP OCC and the program almost being found in an audit in the mid 90s. I highly recommend reading the black budget of the United States by Catherine Austin fits here. Anyways, we'll come back to that. So Eric Davis. I'll read this word for word, but I, you know, I'm not really like a react content type of guy, but we'll just do that. Okay, Eric Davis says to Andre. No, he told me that he would deny meeting with me. Should I publish anything about that? I never published anything about our meeting, but Ed Mitchell's unethical kids released his copy covered by Ed signed NDA of my friends of my interview notes to a friend who had an interest in UFOs. The latter individual is responsible for shopping the notes at a UFO conference to the highest bidder, which was Grant Cameron unethical Grant Cameron consulted a lawyer and decided to publicize the interview notes on this YouTube channel and a podcast. After this is when Wilson denied meeting me when contacted by multiple ufologists and UFO media personalities and mainstream news reporters. But here's the issue with that guys. I have. Remember James Rigney I covered in the video he was the one who kind of got the memo out of the estate got it to Grant Cameron. James Rigney was not sold this document. Whoever the individual in Edgar Mitchell Oscar Edgar Mitchell's estate. Went through his files and between between James Rigney and this individual I don't know who this individual is. And James Rigney shared this with Grant Cameron in fact I have James Rigney up here because to talk about like a Edgar Mitchell's unethical kids I don't think this involved his children at all besides just a relative and Grant Cameron I don't think was sold this document as well. So James Rigney says I showed these notes to Grant and then a few weeks later sent him a copy yes and I've talked to James about this he said this to me. To say they were hawked around to the highest bidder is ludicrous yes there was never a mention of any sale here. Dr Mitchell's family were not involved at all other than Dr Mitchell's nephew now deceased I'm happy to clear any of this up. James Rigney has started to he doesn't post much but I really like that he's talking about this because I think by Eric Davis here he's obviously a little emotional about the Wilson Davis memo and he might not be fully familiar with the process of how it leaked. But I will say before the memo made its way to public multiple people have seen the memo right multiple researchers have. I have also talked to an individual who told me in an off record conversation that he was aware of the memo years before it was ever released so there's some pretty important people who know about this. And I'm not familiar with Nicole actually actually yeah we just talked about Nicole but she has an email from Grant Cameron regarding this. She's Grant Cameron says wow someone is pissed for the record I never shop the Wilson Davis memo notes I promised James Rigney that I would put them in beyond managing magic. When I realized I could not do that I just made the notes free to anyone who asked about them. Chase Williams got a copy and helped me. If everyone had stopped playing cover up I would never have been in such a position. Usually Eric is pretty accurate. He messed up his sovereignty accusations and losing that I would have thought he would be a little more quiet. For the record many of the top researchers have now confirmed they have had the Wilson documents for years and chose to sit on it. Yes, I've definitely heard that too. Why must I be the guy to have to disclose stuff other to disclose stuff other disclosure researchers are hiding. Wilson documents Johnson UFO study. Interesting. Douglas aircraft documents. Interesting. Advanced physics group notes Rockefeller initiative documents. Interesting. And yet vindicated the alien autopsy emails for anybody who hasn't heard about the alien autopsy emails that surrounds the supposed alien autopsy film that was obviously faked in like 11 apartment. But that might be based on a real sort of autopsy there's an email chain with Dr. Kit Green that covers this. So that's what that's what I would like to cover that too because that's very interesting the future. Finally, almost all of the stuff I disclose. I have never read the only I only had to read the first page of the Wilson interview to know what I was holding. Interesting to see Mitchell had to sign an NDA. I assume Bigelow controlled that that's very interesting Edgar Mitchell sign an NDA to receive these meeting notes. If businessmen can silence researchers with NDAs. Why is the community always crying about unethical government obeying their NDAs. No one ever offered me money. Therefore, I was never forced to sign my life away and lie my ass off. So, yeah, I think Grant Cameron makes a really powerful statement here. So I guess the question is now, why did Eric Davis wait until 2024 to discuss the Wilson Davis Mumble. I find that Eric Davis I kind of said this earlier kind of pops up and around when he makes to make statements whether this be discounting guys like Jason Sands discounting Bob Lazar and so forth. Lou, I mean, sorry, Eric Davis has been on kind of a tear lately, talking about Lou saying that he Lou never ran all sapper and a tip specifically. So it seems that I really can't think of an exact reason why now of all times he would discuss the Wilson Davis document. If you remember back to 2004 in Stephen Green Street's basement episode, Green Street actually asked Eric Davis about the memo and Eric Davis just gave the hole. I cannot confirm or deny that. So why now but this is really interesting and extremely consequential. I remember back in the day, guys like John Greenwald and John Greenwald has a fantastic new video on all to all sap and a tip. I really recommend watching that. But he I think he thought the Wilson Davis notes at least I'm not thought he proposed a theory they might be like a film script. So there was just a lot of information shopping around about them. So let's look at some of these comments real fast before we carry on this. Am I mistaken or does Robert Bigelow always seem to get a pass because he's interested in this stuff could be totally wrong. But does anybody ask him to put up or shut up? No, that's a good point. Of course, he's been interested in kind of knit, of course, behind nids and kind of a consciousness studies and after death studies. He has been very quiet since a lot of this is has been discussed. It's because Eric Davis still has a security clearance. Yes, pretty clear. The memo is real. That's why he has to do these obtuse attempts at obfuscation. Yeah, I the at least to myself, I'll admit kind of my biases here. I've always considered the Wilson Davis memo since I began researching it to be authentic. I find just so much valuable information in the memo. And if you guys haven't read it, I really recommend reading it. I think in my video on the Wilson Davis memo, I have it linked. So shall we talk about the, unless anybody has any questions, we'll discuss the 2004 kind of JSOC. You know, is this better for everybody at the black better for everybody's screen? Probably next we'll talk about the JSOC. So Davis admits to what he has is controlling narrative. That's true. Yeah, that's a good point. That is a good point. Doesn't anyone think it's weird to go with the serious TSS clearance would discuss something like this and on and not use not like signal. Yeah, it is weird, but I know I think it's that same Facebook group or others. Eric Davis has been very cavalier about about like Bob Lazar, Jason Sands. He seems to really like a kind of blab about this. So how do you flip the style? If you have a Sumatra PDF, all you have to do is press I, and it really helps. Sumatra PDF is the best. I highly recommend it. Okay. So what let's get to this last one by LC in the weaponized ed cat or weaponized episode with Ernie Klein. He mentions anytime he brought up the memo around Davis put off, etc. other spines would go rigid truth. So which recently Ross Colt Hart did an AMA on Reddit. I think this is his second one. The first time he did an AMA, I think the vast majority of the questions were saying Ross tell us where the craft is in regards to what the craft is in regards to when Ross discussed a craft so large that a building had to be built around it. This AMA was very different. People asked a lot of great questions. Of course, people are kind of discussing skinny Bob and stuff like that again. And somebody said, let's see if I can pull it up. Sorry, I'm not like a guest browser here. Ross called her. No. I'm not a robot motorcycles. No, the helmets won't count. Traffic lights really. Why do you guys have to and you guys watch me do this? I'll probably mess it up. There we go. Look who we got in the chat. Just bought. What's up, Michael? Thanks so much for tuning in. Hey, cool. What's going on, man? Thank you. I really appreciate you tuning in. That's awesome. I'm going to leave this up for a little bit. I really appreciate that, Michael. We're just about to talk about the 2004 incident and sentinels of ether. Just because I think so many people have been talking about John Stewart. And this 2004 incident and there hasn't really been a lot of look back to sentinels of ether. So let's get started, guys. Shardu Shardul 127 or Shardul 27. And this guy's actually in my discord. This was a fantastic question. So if you are watching right now, thanks, dude. I know he posted this in the discord. So thank you. This is a fantastic question. Hi, Ross. Thank you for all that you have done and will do with this topic. Is there any merit to the claim that in 2004 there was a blue on blue firefight between a JSOC unit and a Lockheed Martin recovery team over UAP craft resulting in the deaths of two JSOC members? Ross says just straight up yes and recomments. And that's not the only incident. So now we have Ross commenting on the validity out. And of course, this is just Ross. He hasn't posted any sources or data for this. How do I join the discord server? I think I can post a link here. Let me post it. Sorry, let me post that real fast. Invite people. Yeah, if that link works. So, yes. So we have Ross cold heart commenting on a 2004 blue on blue situation. We have John Stewart's story. I believe this came out in late 2023. I think this was in December. And this was about an individual reaching out to. Let's get Michael's chat back up here. That's cool. This was about an individual reaching out to John about a story of a blue on blue firefight that occurred in, I think, I think. So there's a difference here now between the two sources. I think that Stewart source and we'll get through this as we read through. Claim to this event occurred near the Texas side of the border in the Texas and Mexico border. Sentinels of ether talks about this being on the Koyame Mexico side of the border, which as we know from the Koyame video is very close to the Texas border. So I'll read just this, just the initial message. And then we'll kind of just pick and choose through. I don't just want to, this isn't story time. I'm just not going to read through everything. Hi, John. I saw one of your recent podcasts. Thank you for covering the UAP topic. I have some information you may find useful for this. I served in the USMC and Defense Intelligence Agency as an intelligence analyst and then moved on to Lockheed as a security program manager. I no longer work at Lockheed. I was read into the UAP program and the UAP issue is multifaceted. Well, generally it's known to the public at this point from the recent news articles that the United States USG has its own recovery and storage team for downed in HICraft. Most of the people, okay, sorry. Most of the people in USG community know about downed craft. This is where the real core of the UAP issue lies, not the religious implications or the biologics. Lockheed has had this team since the 1970s and have amassed a hoard of both intact and crashed UAP at a facility in Palmdale, California. At some point around the mid 1980s, they were able to successfully reverse engineer one of these NHICraft and keep this hidden and completely obfuscated from the USG. One of my senior security managers was firsthand legacy witness to this. Lockheed even relinquished some of the original NHICraft back into the custody of USG and lied, quote, saying that they could make no progress. This is where the heart of the dispute between Congress today and Lockheed is coming in to head in Schumer's recent UAP bill demanding the tech from the UAP legacy program. The USG realized that it was lied to about, sorry, I'm just having trouble reading. The USG realized it was lied to about the progress and now want full custody of the ARV vehicles that Lockheed currently has. Even though I was read into the general UAP program, I was never privy to this specific group while I worked for Lockheed, the in-house recovery team. There were only brief water cooler discussions I had with people directly involved that are personal friends I've known for many years. So let's stop before we get into the incident here. USG for anyone asking is US government. Hey, Aiden, my contacts get dry fast. I know I blink a lot. I saw that in the interview with Ryan Wood. I blinked a ton. But USG is the United States government. The story here, what is really interesting is so many times throughout my videos, we've covered a retrieval effort, mostly like spearheaded by the Air Force and so forth, Air Force elements, possibly JSOC. There's good reason to believe that something like the 24th STS group within JSOC and the Air Force has some part to play in crash retrievals. There's actually a Reddit whistleblower, a supposed whistleblower a couple months ago that had a really interesting testimony on this. But to hear this about private corporation recovery teams, this is really interesting and not something that we have covered too much. Of course, there's the idea of these black operative black operator programs that deal with craft and deal with humans and deal with operations. But we have never really explored the extent to which they have recovered downcraft. So here this individual reaching out to John Stuart claims that Lockheed Martin has its own recovery team. Now, I can't remember and we'll get through this if this describes kind of the experience of the operators, what they have if they're former like tier one, if they're just PMC guys. I'm not quite sure, but this is really interesting to dive into this territory about basically a private team that is not associated with kind of US operations. As we get into this, this raises some even more interesting questions how this Lockheed Martin recovery team deals with JSOC units. And if you don't know JSOC, this is joint special operations command. This is the best of the best in US armed forces. This is like 24th STS. This is one 60th division. This is Navy SEAL Team 6. This is Green Beret. These are just some bad dudes. So I'll keep, let's see how much longer we got in this. Yeah. Okay. I'll read the rest of this and then we'll discuss. I know of an incident in 2004 where one of Lockheed's own reverse engineered ARV craft, one of Lockheed's own reverse engineered ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicle, crashed into the Southwest. The USG was monitoring. They thought it was genuine NHI craft. They sent their own recovery team out from JSOC, but there was a violent altercation between them and the Lockheed recovery team that resulted in two deaths. This is the incident Grush is referring to when he says people have been killed to keep the UAP secret. This was a blue on blue situation between two completely separate recovery teams. The USG group had no awareness of the other one. I was privy to the names of two cuts off our satellite office. However, I would not go to public and I am not sure about releasing this information. The only caveat to this is I remember the names of the two airmen that were killed, especially stuck out to me because they were both clearly of Asian descent. I am Asian myself. I debated a few times trying to inquire a way to track down immediate relatives and maybe contacting them. I don't know what should be done. Honestly, I'm fairly certain the immediate families to this day are not aware of the actual circumstances regarding their passing. I think John and him kind of go back a little bit there. Here we are faced with the kind of, yes, I think 0604 says this friendly fire here. This is blue on blue action here. Like Michael says, JSOC has a bunch of good guys. This is really interesting. Here we are faced with the prospect of a US based retrieval team. They have their rapid reaction unit and they see this craft they think is an HII craft. Then there's the Lockheed Martin team that knows that their own reverse engineered ARV has crashed and they sent their team. There's a collision between the forces and JSOC, maybe they got the jump on them, which is surprising because JSOC again is the best of the best by this PMC, Private Military Corporation, almost Lockheed team. We have this story here and I will link this in the discord if anybody wants to read more because there's a lot here. But this parallels the story told by the insider that Michael has spoken to who published two chapters of a manuscript called Sentinels of Ether, which is kind of used in this individual's words as basically a ploy on dops or similar to secret machines by Tom DeLonge to put truth and fiction to get out information. I think this was also done back in the 80s or 90s with Sedge Masters and Project Zodiac. So this isn't a new tactic. This has been done multiple times. And yes, that is really terrifying. But we won't read Sentinels of Ether, but I have just read it recently so I can tell you a little more about what it's about. This story doesn't directly deal with a craft recovery. This deals with people being trafficked. And there is basically a JSOC team that gets the jump on, not necessarily the jump, but they observe this trafficking operation from some Hueys. And this JSOC team is cornered and killed brutally by whatever this team is that are trafficking these individuals. The individuals are in Koyama, Mexico, and they load up on their helicopters, maybe with their cargo, maybe not, and they fly to a secret base around the region. So those are the differences here. There's no mention of Lockheed in the Sentinels of Ether story. There's no mention of Lockheed in John Stuart's whistleblower. There's no mention of craft in Sentinels of Ether, but there's mention of craft in John Stuart's whistleblower. There's a direct location given in Sentinels of Ether, including Koyama, Mexico. It's a little different in John Stuart's, which calls mainland US. So those are the small differences. Of course, we don't have direct supporting evidence, but this 2004, this reminds me so closely of the 1974 Koyama incident, which occurred 40 years later in the same place in Koyama, Mexico. If you guys haven't watched that video, this is about an alleged story of a crash that occurred on the Mexican side of the border seen by people in kind of a remote area. A Mexican retrieval team is sent to investigate. The CIA has the jump on this recovery operation, and they send in the rapid reaction unit. But something based on their surveillance has shown that the Mexican retrieval team has stopped, was killed by something. This is, and the Americans take over the wreckage. Now, it's still not clear if the Mexican retrieval team was killed from some sort of leakage from the craft or that the US killed them. And still, this is just a story. There's not a lot of evidence for that case. I covered it because it's so interesting. But so we have, we have the Sentinels of Ether story. We have the 2004 John Stuart, supposed whistleblower. And then we have the 1974 Koyame instant, which all kind of tie in together. It's an extremely interesting story. I'll be interested to see if John Stuart has a further comment on this. As far as I know, he hasn't said very much. I think people have just kind of been, I think he's just kind of been saying like, haha, like I got it. I think he's just kind of been celebrating the victory on her. We still don't know if his whistleblower is telling the truth. I think that this person kind of went AWOL and AFK after this and John tried to follow up with him, but there wasn't, but there wasn't, he couldn't get in contact with the guy. So let's, if there's any questions now, let's, let's go through them. I just kind of wanted to touch on that because I felt like a lot of people were drawing to attention to the, to John Stuart's locking Martin whistleblower, but there was some parts of the puzzle missing to factor in Sentinels of Ether and the 1974 Koyame incident. So, yeah. So if anybody has any questions, we'll, we'll kind of go through that and maybe in about like 10, 15 minutes, we'll, we'll start wrapping up. I'm, I'm trying to think of any other kind of breaking into incidents right now. I would like to know what you guys think of imminent so far. Again, I haven't read the full thing. I've mostly been catching up on loose media appearances so far. And okay, let's, let's, let's see this. Michael says, Ross has definitely been in touch with me on some details, not too much since he's busy, but soon I expect to meet with him and tell him face to face. Now I would really be interested to see what Ross and Michael discuss. If everybody remembers Ross's previous AMA, somebody asked him like, what do you think of the Michael Herrera case? And he says he was actively investigating. So I'm really excited to hear further developments on that. So that's wildly exciting. Let me get a sip of water here. So yeah, besides that guys, again, I'm hoping to, I'm hoping to see Jesse Michaels quite soon. I think he's, I think he's coming out to the state and I'm excited to meet up with him. We are working on the, I kind of leaked it. I don't really like to say it, but let's, let's, the group I encountered is private, but plucked from former special operations groups. I know some of them personally, but they are good guys helping me with that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's something I wanted to talk on. Remember in the Arrow historical report volume one, they claimed that Michael said to them that he encountered us special forces. No, and Michael has been clear about this since the beginning that he encountered a private team that had no association that he knew at the time from American special forces. Let's, okay, let's start going through these. I'm catching this room a bit late, but I'm so lost. I'm not on all this. I thoughts on all this about I, but tell me why you're lost. Man, I'll get you up. I'm sorry. I know I can drag on a bit. That's why I like to make scripts because I can just drone on about AI designating designing craft and military being infiltrated to the point where top secret stuff needs to be hidden. I have a, I have a good friend who actually is working on like a really good thesis about kind of the phenomenon and, and craft being sort of like a really AI driven and maybe like a biomechanical artificial intelligence. And so I would kind of like to follow up with him on that. Pete says, imminent as part of the drip feed of disclosure, anything cleared for official releases. Why are they starting to disclose is the interesting part. Yeah, I agree. Why is, like, why does Dobser approve of Lou discussing a 1950 crash retrieval case? Why does Dobser approve of Lou discussing Operation Interloper and so forth? This is very interesting. Everything is cleared with Dobser. Same with David Grush as well. The idea of a drip feed of disclosure is interesting because, of course, there's likely elements within USG that are deeply entwined in the program who do not want any of this information to come out. Is there ever a point where top secret stuff doesn't need to be hidden? I think, I can't remember, but I think people like Grush and Elizondo have a great take on this. With NHI technology and so forth, perhaps the technology itself and how to operate this technology can remain classified. You don't need someone who would wish harm to others, being able to harness a craft that can go supersonic in an eighth of a second. But I think the reality of this situation shouldn't be classified top secret. I think all of humanity has a right to know the extent to what program officials and people high up in USG and the military know about UFOs, their purpose on this planet, their modus operandi and so forth. What is your opinion on Salvador Pais? Pais is super interesting. I covered him in the Off-World Technologies Division. He worked out of NAVAR, the Naval Air Facility in Maryland. And he, of course, has patents on kind of almost like a kind of quantum vacuum fluctuations, powering like an almost diamond or triangular shaped craft. If you haven't, I really recommend listening to his appearance on Kurt Geimungal's theory of everything where he talks a little bit more about physics. Physics was never my strong suit, so I'm not, I don't have a ton of interesting things to add there, but Salvador Pais is super interesting. And I find his patents wild, especially how they were initially denied, but they were picked up by the Navy. And he was working out of NAVAR, Pax River. What's up, OptiV? How you doing, man? Great to see you. Great to see you, brother. Danny Sheehan answered Mitchell's question in Jesse Michaels' interview. He said it's because Lockheed wants the license to tech and sell it. Okay, I haven't, I don't remember that part, but thank you for saying that. Have I been interviewed before? No, I don't know. No, I have not. That kind of would be fun, but as you can tell, I kind of ramble, so we'd see how that goes. Group C says imminent is crap. Excuse my French, a mix of truth and lies. That's how good disinformation works. Lou is clear to say what he says. Of course, there's still a lot of discourse around Lou, ASAP, and ATIP. If you guys haven't, I know he can be a divisive member in the community, but John Greenwald's recent video on kind of the memorandums and different files that have been released from ATIP and ASAP surrounding Lou and other players. That is super interesting, and I really highly recommend that. It makes the can of worms so much deeper. So please watch that. China stand is why Kona Blue was proposed. Lockheed went into the vest of its materials, and Kona Blue was meant to be the way that happened, and to the CIA put a kibosh on it. Yeah, to divest materials into the hands of Bigelow Aerospace from Lockheed Martin. You got a signed copy of imminent. That's awesome, man. That's super cool. That's super cool. Since imminent had to go through the Pentagon approval for its contents, I think the section on alien implants is a slow drip for acknowledging abduction phenomena. Scary thought. Yeah, again, we talked about implants a little earlier. I think the basis of that work needs to come off of Dr. Lear's work throughout history, because it's just such a strange concept to wrap your head around, and the implications of the abduction phenomena, if true, are extremely disturbing as well. Anytime someone monetizes UFO stuff, I'm out, YouTube doesn't count for now. So that's like the grifter argument, right? I don't think Lou is a grifter at all. I think that after many years, for whatever reason, he's releasing this book. But I do agree that a lot of people will just kind of make a lot of UFO content or big claims for not much reason. But I personally wouldn't throw Lou in that category, but I still need to read all of him in it. So my opinion is not fully formed. I have one huge advice to you before you get into abjections and all that. Learn about the science. Listen to Tom Bearden's lectures, because if you don't, you'll think that everything is E.T. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, I appreciate that. With any subject getting into, I want to make sure I have a strong foundation for research. Dobser is only there to censor classified specific details. Lou chooses his references carefully and tiptoes around classified details. Yes, he does. You can see that in the JRE interview and so forth. Lou is very good at drawing the line where he's speculating and not speculating and drawing the line where he can't go further and drawing the line to say, I can't talk about this, but here is an example. Also, what do you guys think about the Lou on JRE appearance? I think Lou, I think Joe was a lot softer on Lou than he was on David Grush. I was re-listening to the David Grush interview recently. And Joe, a lot of the time, you see, almost took a position of disbelief to everything Grush said, which was a little strange to me, a little strange. Kelly Cahill is where to start looking for abductions. Gotcha. Gotcha. Do you know of any other good UAP YouTubers? Watch all of your vids and want more info. So I don't watch too much UFO related content. And part of the reason I made this channel is I thought there was a bit of a lapse in serious research outside of guys like Richard Dolan. So my advice would be just to read, to be honest. I would read Leonard Stringfield's Crash Retrievals one through seven. Those are brilliant. I would read Stephen Greer's disclosure briefing document from 2001. I would read Magic Eyes Only by Ryan Wood. I would read In Plain Sight by Ross Colthart. But I would also watch Ross Colthart interviews on the kind of need to know as well as anything he's done with Bryce Zabel. There's also a lot of good old documentaries such as stuff with James Fox. So as far as content goes, I don't know. I'm not too familiar with other UFO content creators besides some of the big dogs like Dolan. Sad to hear Lou is financially hurt by TTSA. Yeah, of course that kind of muddies up TTSA. So what do you think about the Orbs in Lou's house? I find it very strange. Kind of he really doesn't hesitate to go into kind of like the Hitchhiker effect of UAP and strange stuff following him home from work at ATV. I think even his wife commented on this as well. I'll have to find her comments, but that was really interesting to see her wife talk about that. Matt's under his correction. Danny Sheehan, tiptoes and whispers to Lou. Back to Pete. And abductions are the hardest part to swallow once the realization of UAP is real. It's terrifying. I agree. The implications of abductions are very terrifying. I remember growing up that one of the first books I had was a book on Betty and Barty Hill, and it just scared the life out of me as a kid. John Greenwald clearly has a theory about why, in his words, both sides are lying. Do you have any thoughts on what John's theory may be? Yeah, I think in his latest video, he says very specifically, neither side is telling the truth. And this could just be, like I can't think for John, of course. Even though I don't always agree with everything he says, I think John is a pretty well thought out person. He takes his time to craft his theses. So I would wait to hear from him, but of course this could possibly be, he just thinks this is room to muddy the water around the UAP discussion and create endless debate about atyp and asap. I talked about this already, but how is Japan? Japan was the greatest place I've ever been and has the best food I've ever had. I want to go back so bad. I didn't get to go to Kodokanjudo in Tokyo and I went to so bad. So bad. It was obviously a PR deal and Joe didn't take it seriously with Grush or Lou. Yeah, it was strange that he didn't take it seriously. I think that David Grush is one of the most valuable people to speak to right now. So it was strange. It was bizarre, Lou. I think he made a conscious effort and he talked about this on JRE, that he was on JRE to talk about the phenomenon and not plug his own book, which I definitely respect, but he gave John Greenwald a huge shout out. And I know that Greenwald has had his huge problems and has been very outspoken about Lou. So that was interesting to see. I think it's curious how all the Senate hearings started right after the Chinese balloon. What are the odds that UAP topic is used as a vehicle to pass reforms with that deal with foreign stuff? I do not think so because if we look at the Schumann legislation for both 2023 and 2024, it is very, very, very clear that the subject we're dealing with is non-human technology and legacy programs. Very clear. I think in the 2024 NDAA, non-human intelligence has mentioned about 27 times, I think it is. I feel like him not plugging his book was partially to avoid. Yeah, yeah. I agree. I agree. Timothy Good's Unearthly Disclosure is an excellent book. Yes. And was it Timothy Good that also wrote above? They're not above Top Secret. Need to know was that his book, but Timothy Good is great. I can't remember right now. If Lou can do remote view, why doesn't he hold a bit of demonstrations? Unlike UFO UAP, he has control on that. I would like to see demonstrations from people who claim they can operate remote viewing. I feel such a strange territory for me. I'd really like to see that. First thought was a skunk work spying on him. I'd like to understand the technology behind those dang orbs then, especially if they can operate indoors. I have a three paragraph argument regarding UAP origins and the phenomena of abductions. If anyone is interested to see it, where could I post? My friend, you could email that to me at uapgrub at gmail.com or you could join my discord and post that to see. I'll copy that and put the link in one more time because I'd love to read it. I'd absolutely love to read it. Sounds awesome. Lou's wife was in the News Nation interview. Okay. The grifter argument makes no sense. Take Greer, for example. He does two CE5 events a year. He's not a millionaire. How can he fund the disclosure project? Whistleblower needs his events with no money. I bet Greer, I do think that Greer has income streams outside of just UAP if I had to guess. I know he used to be a practicing ER trauma doctor, but I'm not sure. Mike says, I'm not sure why, but it seems very human that the orbs followed him after he was investigating from within the Pentagon. That's very strange. I need to read that passage in imminent. Again, sort of like with remote viewing and stuff, that territory is very foreign for me. I approach it slowly when I read about it because it's uncomfortable for me, which I'm sure it is for many of you. What is your methodology for conducting research? That is a really good question. I really appreciate that. When I'm investigating a crash retrieval, for example, I will find a respected person that has covered this crash retrieval before. For example, for the 1974 case in Koyame, Mexico, that was Ryan Wood in Magic Eyes Only. He covered the case. I use that as a starting point. From that, I make a personal note sheet for myself of every single aspect I want to check out. Then every single aspect, for example, Koyame mentions Fort Bliss and stuff like that. I will go look at ufo-search.com, which is a great website by Richard Geldreich. I can't remember that post events by date. I will start researching if there's any blue book, sorry, not blue book, but any recorded sightings or information on that day. If any official documents have been released about aspects of Fort Bliss and operations there on that day, or any official documents exist around that case, I'll analyze the Moondust Archive. I'll analyze the Blue Book Archive. I'll analyze if any popular figures on UAP disclosure have talked about this. Then I'll start researching the subject I'm working on in books. For example, I know when I covered a ufo case, I had to go into some of Jacques Valet's old works. My research always conducts with starting a foundational layer and topics I want to branch out on, and using various websites and books to find out more information and continue that as a decision tree. The most important part for my research, as I'm sure it would be for anybody, is really good record keeping, because there's so much you can find when researching any case. What's important to me is to have bullet points for subjects and appropriate links, and from there have even further offshoots and just dive into what I find interesting about the cases. Then when I can form a thesis, I'll start to think how I can write a topic when using my references and evidence. I'm an engineer by trait, so I approach each script as I would, like an engineering research paper, kind of like an introduction, an abstract, the data, the investigation, the conclusion, the references, and so forth. Keep up the great work. Thank you, man. You're one of the very few people that do thorough research. You're like Richard Dolan in his early days, and not only not as naive. I appreciate that. I love you too, man. Thank you so much. I love doing this. This topic is so multifaceted. It's so tough to kind of get to the bottom of anything, so I'm just kind of trying to do my part, slowing things down, analyze things on a case-by-case or topic-by-topic basis. Steph says, hey, Grubb, appreciate you for life, brother, and thank you, man. I'm sure thousands of us feel the same. What do you think the phenomena actually is? What's your theory so far if you could share? Sorry if asked. So this has always been really interesting. I've always kind of bounced between the thought of extraterrestrials versus what some people like to refer to as, like, ultra-terrestrials, a.k.a. beams that may not exist in our three dimensions, spatial dimensions, and one temporal dimension. Lately, I've found quite a bit of credible testimony that refers to crashed craft as specifically extraterrestrial. So there could be a combination of a presence on this planet, extraterrestrial, and some things that don't necessarily exist in maybe a corporeal body or what we would think as a physical being. But right now, if I just had to think out loud and just kind of say, here's what I think for crash retrievals and these crashed craft, right now I lean more towards just a pure extraterrestrial source. Another thing I feel could be possible is that these craft, through its own AI, may be able to access psychic wavelengths themselves. What explain a lot of behaviors that people have experienced? Yeah, absolutely. Find various methodologies and kind of, I don't know what sort of wave, maybe radio waves, a frequency that can start to distort cognition and so forth. Yeah, I agree with you. I think that's a great point. I wrote it over at post-disclosure. Where can we find that, my friend? I'd love to see it. When are you going to upload the video on the glass ball that reacted to consciousness? I have uploaded that. That is the Off-World Technologies Division. Now, there is an individual that I am speaking to and that's really great that has also claimed to have observed such a thing. So I hope I have an update on that because it's very interesting. Okay, Michael, Greer does real estate as well, so he's making money with that. Not sure if he does that as much. Perfect. Okay, we know that besides just CE5, that Greer has other streams of income. Sorry, I wrote it over at post-disclosure, but so far no one is reading it. Hey, post it over here. Post in the Discord, man. People here, we take this seriously. People will want to read this. I promise you, man, I certainly will. He then talked to the CIA guy and Joe seemed like he doubted the whole UAP thing, not going to lie. Yeah, Mike Baker always seems to pop up whenever Joe talks to a UAP guy. Mike Baker, I've seen a lot of comments on Reddit and so forth saying that Mike Baker is his handler. I think that's hilarious. I think Mike Baker has appeared on JRE 14 times, which is a lot. So, you know, whatever. Zach, that English dude tried pretty hard to nail Lou down to no avail. I didn't love Lou's answers, makes it sound like he wants to stop corruption, but also won't point out what the corruption is. That's the English channel, the sort of smaller channel. Props to that guy for getting an interview with Lou. That's really cool to hear. I haven't listened to that yet, so I absolutely will. I know a couple clips of that are going around now. Spoonbending parties, isn't that Yuri Geller's claim? If I'm remembering correctly, the spoonbending. Why would an interdimensional capable ET race abduct humans and put implants in them to track them, et cetera? It's a very human thing. ETs don't need it and they can do it without physical contact. Yeah, I mean, there's so many, whenever you reach hypothesis like extraterrestrial or even ultra dimensional or something like that, there's still so many questions. I know one of my good friends who really thinks this, the whole phenomenon comes down to a sort of advanced planetary AI that originates from outside our solar system. He's got a lot to add here. I think everybody on this planet has their own UFO stories. I mean, a lot of people do. I never really talk about it because to me, just a single witness testimony, there's not much to it. I, of course, multiple times in my life have just seen lights in the sky making very sharp turns, not satellites, because I'm always very careful to pay attention to that. Bright lights that seem to make angles are kind of dart around in the sky. I don't pay too much attention because I have no confirming evidence. I have no kind of multi-sensor detection. But I, you know, I like, I'd say a lot of people have seen strange things in the sky. Kudos for remaining open-minded and getting into the personal infighting that plays the community. Yeah, man. I've noticed on Twitter, there's a lot of, a heck of a lot of drama, especially around Lou, so much drama. I don't know how you could investigate fighting like that. So I don't, I don't want to get into that. Chris Bledsoe, I don't really have an opinion right now. I'm reserving judgment for doing a deeper dive on, on Chris. I've heard favorable and unfavorable things about Mr. Bledsoe, but right now I do not have much, much to go on. Am I skeptical about remote viewing? It's highly skeptical to me. This is such a, this is a great question. If you asked me a couple of months ago, I'd say a lot of the woo connected with the phenomenon is like a very strange. Over time, just reading kind of the research papers from SRI and SAIC, listening to David Grush talk about Stargate and now Lou. And even people I trust like Ryan Wood even commented on remote viewing and so forth. I, I find that I, I've never observed any instance of remote viewing. I cannot do it. I don't know anybody that can. So I've not seen evidence, but my mind is a lot more open to it than before. Of course, the more you study the UFOs, the more kind of strange things and psychic phenomena get introduced. So it's, it's, it's very tough to separate the two. It's very interesting. And like I always say, it's a really kind of uncomfortable territory for me because I've never interacted with anybody who claims to have psionic abilities or be psychic. So I would really like to see a remote viewing demonstration if I'm being honest. Have I read loose threads by Omega point? I have not my friend, but I will write that down because that sounds. Any book. I will absolutely read. Thank you. The hitchhiker effect is a real thing, not just with UAP agreed. Tom Bearden explains in detail down to the equations, how to make orbs and anti-gravity craft in one of his lecturers called psychotronics. It's on YouTube. I have, I've not watched that lecture. So I, I got, I got some good homework to do. Thank you. Let's always the real deal. All right. Then I will, I will continue to research and when I spend some time to sit down with Chris, have you seen one of the new Ross cold heart reality checks with MJ 12? It gave credential to MJ 12 because of the 2022 JFK. Yes, I have. And that was with the Australian gentleman. That was fantastic. In my MJ 12 document, I kind of referenced it because Lou had just talked about it. It kind of really renewed interest in MJ 12 and JFK. Fantastic. Ross is, Ross does some really great work. And that Australian researcher is awesome too. That dude was recalling facts off the top of his head, like nobody's business. First, all your chain are covering the UFO flag. Hey, cool. That was forever ago. It looks to just too odd to be fake. Watch it on loop sometimes. You know what? Now after the claims of Lou, I'd like, and of course, Grush last year, I'd like to see some of that dang 4k satellite footage. Who would you say is the John Mack of today? That's a great question. I have no idea. I don't know if anybody is doing the serious work today that kind of John Mack did. John Mack was really ahead of his time, took the abduction phenomenon so seriously. I really respect John Mack's work. The Wilson Davis was pretty much known to be real. Yes, but he finally confirmed it in Facebook group. I feel bad for him because he had to take the hit on some trustworthiness with his clearance. Yes. I think a lot of people kind of saw the validity in the Wilson Davis memo, including the context around it and so forth. Thank you for answering. Thank you, man. I appreciate that. You take care and stay safe as well, brother. Matt, I've been in Battelle facilities in Columbus and West Jeff, Ohio. Do not see anything UAP related, but they def have the security and facilities to keep it hidden beyond what I could access. I think it's Lou who discusses now for Detrick in Maryland containing biologics. And so that's a great research avenue to go down now. Thank you so much for all. Thank you, Matt. I appreciate that. Integrity is definitely something I hold near and dear. I may seem kind of like an idiot sometimes, but if I'm unfamiliar with the topic or something, I don't know. I promise you, I'll always tell you if kind of my knowledge on something isn't up to snuff. I think it's important. I don't have all the answers to this. I just might be well versed in some of the cases I've covered. Shout out to I will always matter. The chat can get the chat can get tough to read by everybody's putting in the questions to speak to me. So I will always try to answer every single question. The sphere does sound a lot like the the bet sphere. What was interesting to me how this was described the sphere at this division was the sort of indent on top as if one would place a hand. But it does. It is similar to the the bet sphere. Have you seen, have you dived into eyes on cinema? Yeah. Eyes on cinema is really good. I don't know how the heck they get some of their their footage. I mean, they have some great stuff down to like old interviews with Ryan Wood and Dr. Robert Wood. I've never seen in my life before. I don't know how they do that. They have amazing footage. I don't know for sure, but pretty sure you can pay. You can pay to get to get on JRE. Really? That's I don't know if I'd want to go. I don't know. That'd be a fun experience, but I don't think I'm there yet. I know it's far from your top priority and I really appreciate that you don't chase the algorithm, but I really hope to see you get the credit. I hope so, man. That'd be really cool to kind of have a bigger platform to talk about this. But, you know, we grow, we are we are grown steady. We're almost at 10,000 subscribers in nine, a little less than nine months. So that's really, really great. And shout out Michael Herrera for being a legend. Yeah. Thank you so much, Michael, for joining the chat. If you're still here, that that's so awesome to see you in here. That English dude. You got Sean and Rob Tanner. You know, I got Sean. I don't even like Sean O'Malley, but sugar show is going to knock him out clean. This upcoming weekend is a treat for sports fans. We got one fight night Denver, which I didn't get tickets to. And then we have fight night Gilbert Burns, Sean Brady, great fight night. And then Sunday we got them Cincinnati bangles playing. So I'm sorry to my girlfriend, but we're watching a lot of sports this weekend. Thanks. Just email it to you. Thank you very much. I will read it either tonight or tomorrow when I catch up with my emails. Thank you. OptiV because the phenomenon is real and people within the government know this. It would be illegal for a lot of these whistleblowers to reveal too much. They go to prison and truth remain obscured. I think even the whistleblower protection act doesn't cover pensions. So even whistleblowers coming forward, there's still a very real threat to how they will provide for their family, especially after they've had a long and industrious military or kind of intelligence or USG career. I think that's a big concern for a lot of whistleblowers that's being overlooked. No pension security is offered here with whistleblower protection. How can we assume what NHI is capable of or not? It makes sense to me that they would use implants to do detailed monitoring. Yeah, of course, with NHI, non-human intelligence, it's very difficult to kind of attribute human traits, human thought processes or human capabilities to something that is not human. We know they can manipulate physics as we know it to travel almost instantaneously, accelerate and perform feats of acceleration and deceleration that would turn humans and our best ballistic missiles into piles of grease. So, yeah, to kind of assume what they're capable or not capable of is tough speculation. Anytime any topic gets a lot of clicks, eyeballs, you will get those who want to take advantage of it just don't be a fool. Yeah, I agree. That's why I tend not to do like news of the day type stuff. I like to sit back and really spend my time researching stuff and really spend my time focusing on one case at a time. Doing kind of the news of the day stuff, you can really get caught up in a lot of stuff and that's just not really my style either. Michael says, thank you to Pete. I'm just a guy who talked about some crazy stuff and that happened. Little did I know how much we connect the dots. Thank you, Michael. Mr. T. What's up, man? How you doing? Whitley Streber's implants given the ability to pull up information about anything in his vision while he's writing. That sounds like the eyes from the Black Mirror episode. Do you know the episode where the, the some husband like it gets blocked by his wife also in white Christmas? Is it true you grew up within walking distance to Lockheed in Littleton says Jim Shoe? Yes, I did. The Lockheed Deer Creek facility in Littleton was walking distance. It's nestled within the start of the Rocky Mountains right after what we call the Hogback, which is where two tectonic plates push up against each other. Rumor has it that facility goes deep into the mountains. I lived about a four minute, five minute walk from one of Lockheed's biggest, biggest locations. Thank you for all you do. I appreciate it. Thank you, my brother. I will answer any question. UFOs seem to be becoming a gateway to witchcraft. A lot more people are starting to kind of dive into kind of like a more woo as people call it, like a psionic stuff, psychic stuff as they talk about UFOs. It's actually really exploded this year. So I do agree with you. Have you watched the Men Who Stare at Goats? Great movie about remote view. I haven't seen that since it was in theaters, man. That is a good movie, Men Who Stare at Goats. I need to watch that again. I highly recommend Loose Threads. I will be reading it, my friend. I would highly recommend you watch the Joe McGonagall interview on Sean Ryan. Absolutely. I love Sean Ryan's projects. Absolutely. That sounds great. Have you noticed the sudden rise in USO stuff now? Yes. Since Timothy Gallaudet has spoken about it, there's a lot of buzz about USO. This is a great topic. I hope it really starts to get covered. I know a lot of guys like Green Wall or sorry, Green Street and McWest like to point to a new video of a transmedial concept for a Chinese drone being behind all USO sightings. But no, sir. We have done a couple of USO videos on this channel and some USO cases are some of the most interesting. I think back to Kevin Knuth at the Seoul Foundation who discussed a case where a USO traveled under a New Zealand destroyership knocking out all the power. I had a great conversation with this about my family the other night. My younger brother asked where to start and your channel, Red Panic Wallace, intro videos were my number one picks. Thank you, man. Red Panic Wallace, his documentaries are classics. Those are fantastic. They're so good. They're so good. Max Barr, have I looked into the gate program? Ross Colhart mentioned it in an AMA a few days ago. Not yet, but that is on my list of stuff to research after I finish. I've worked with Kecksburg in a certain private corporation that Mr. Kermit has also helped me look into. RV is very real and it's so easily allowable that people deny it. I really want to see remote viewing demonstration. I struggled with it because I've never personally been able to do such a thing or have viewed it, but I would really love to see situations of remote viewing. My mind is open to it. I really want to see it. Please quit your day job to do this full-time. I'd love to if the if the bills can be paid that be That'd be great. Do you think mj-12 could be a scythe for the us created for russia? That is the claim of Mr. John B. Alexander If you recognize if you recognize the likely reality of ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering It does not make sense to me to create a program for the russians to draw attention to ufo crash retrieval in reverse engineering especially how how the majestic files reference so much of roswell and and other cases and Vannevar bush and some key players who were You know even outside of their association with mj-12 general nathan twining really senior us guys It seems strange to me to bring a lot of attention to them So maybe some documents could be but i struggle to personally see how the whole set of mj-12 documents as a whole could be Used for russian disinformation Writing you now re eric mitchell. Please keep an eye. Yes, absolutely What do you think of warner von bran's warning that one day will be told ufo's are a threat which happens since 2017 Yeah, the the threat narrative that weaves in with project blue beam if if i'm correct, right a lot of people like to point to Reagan's speech re says i think of a world where like our nations would be united under the threat of an alien invasion Uh, I think it's interesting. I definitely think lu and the ttsa guys more so than somebody like grush kind of, um discuss the Danger of uap Which I I I don't really have an opinion there, but I do notice that that lu discusses more of the danger of uap and I find it very interesting Very interesting Do you bother with ancient text or religious references that seem like uap or strictly to docks from the last 100 years? No, when I when I first started talking to my friends about this because my channel first started like a huge PowerPoint for my friends I think it ended up being like 300 slides before I said i'm just going to make videos I prefer more time spent on individual topics I did reference many cases from before the past 100 years including the settings over nuremberg the 1897 aurora texas supposed an incident Some interesting lights seen in like 1100 in jerusalem and so forth So there's a lot of really interesting sightings over the course of history the san diego sphere By yes, the the full like 17 video 17 minute video by it's redacted is great The san diego sphere It seems to be like a small metallic sphere with like a row of of almost like black portholes around it Even though there's nothing to signify there's lights, but with three or two or three almost antennae often I recommend going to watch that video. It's it's really interesting I get the feeling we maybe do for a mass public UFO sighting They just seem to have happened every decade or two within the last I can think of being the 2006 oh hair UFO just before smartphones That'd be great if we could get something a modern day like the 1952 UFOs over washington dc. That'd be fantastic After reading loose book I'm taking a remote viewing more seriously, but I'm disappointed with russell targ's third eye spies Hopefully there are some other resources giving us a working model now. I'd like to know If you're starting to dive into the topic of remote viewing what sort of sources are you? Reading about and so forth. So I might be able to piggyback off some of that research I need to kind of understand more of about where to start besides just reading the research papers from sri And s a i c and stargate and so forth Tanner, yes, you have been here since the get go man. I remember you commenting on the first video So I really really really appreciate it really appreciated What topic would you introduce to joe? I would just want to talk about crash retrievals for like three hours to be honest I know we talk about many topics here, but the sort of similar to ryan wood crash retrievals is what I View as my bread and butter for investigation. There's nothing more that I love than looking into a crash retrieval case Uh sick card this week. Yeah, the the uh brady burns card is very good and also uh haggardy and superluck and Denver on one That's a great one championship. Zach Oh, and if you don't use it you need to get the hour breakdown of the wilson davis memo richard dolin does with mr X who I think is travis taylor they go into every single detail Oh, that sounds great. Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen that that sound. I would love to watch that We'll be seeing you a few years in jerry as a legitimate boots on the ground I'd love that and I'd also love to uh, you guys know joe does jiu jitsu. He's a blockbot I'd love to roll around with him a little bit joe is a short stocky man So he could probably give me some trouble on the mats O'Malley has grown on me. I agree, but o'malley is nasty with his striking I mean anybody but cheeto vera with a titanium skull would have gotten Eviscerated by that knee up the middle. O'Malley's a beast. He looks like a sideshow attraction, but he's a beast I will continue. I can't continue to believe youtube is effing with your channel. Come on. You should be well over 50k Do you think anyone? No, I don't want to go. I don't want to go into Subjects like that. Maybe it's just difficult. Maybe there's There needs to be over time. There will be more of a growth and interest in the uap topic. So We'll see we won't we won't go into that We won't go into that now Now I remember when bob lasar was on jerry. He also talked about a sphere that was an s4 when I had a dent Really, I don't remember that. I'm going to look back at that now I remember back when that uh, I think it was 2019 if I'm remembering when bob and uh, jeremy corbel went on jerry. That was awesome What are your views on philip j corso's claims the day after roswell is a very interesting book And I've been told recently by somebody very credible that I just got in contact with and I'm talking to to make specific note of What corso states uh happened with the technology gleaned off the roswell craft? So I'm actively pursuing some investigations off of corso's work right now if that answers the question I got to say this chat. Yeah, this chat is this chat is great. I mean we got Mr. Michael Herrera in the chat talking to people we've got people asking great comments This chat is lovely. I've been in other chats where people are just saying wild stuff. So I very very very much appreciate this Have I ever spoken to jessie michaels? Yes jessie michaels is my friend I jessie michaels is such a cool dude He first got in contact with him on my kingman video and Maybe this week I will be hanging out with jessie michaels this week or next and I can't wait jessie's awesome He's done so much for this subject made so many great videos. I really can't wait One thing about ai is that it needs to be taught constantly any chance you think the internet is how it studies us That would from a from an ai studying the internet would be the perfect way to kind of understand the zeitgeist of humanity Now would I be worried that an ai would be looking at the internet to gleam off humans and look at the memes and all the terrible things online? Absolutely, but I I think that that's very valid I I think that's a great method for even the a biological based Non-human intelligence species to simply understand humanity at a glance Michael Herrera is a legend. He is a legend That's weird timing That is weird timing. I was just listening to his Interview with william paulik the other day Uh because I found it in the files of greer that wasn't on youtube apparently It wasn't until paulik's death in about 2005 or 2007 that his family agreed for this to be published william paulik talks about deep projects including implants uh for for operators and so forth made out of a Facility near denver. This is a very interesting case and that's actually really weird timing. You bring that up I've never seen anybody else talk about mr. Paulik So that's great. Um See what a michael say thanks matt. I hope what I break open soon at some point will be legendary and help I would love that. I cannot wait to cover that Speaking of goats big ups to all the goats in this chat. Yeah, everybody here's amazing. Thank you for for everybody Um everybody I just joined bro. You're covering the best the best wilson davis moment majestic documents You know, I got a shout out to everybody that has uh kind of helped me in my investigation been there for me Uh, everybody has helped so much. So whether it be joey michael ryan wood Mr. R. A. There's so many great guys that so many wonderful people around me You and jesse michaels go deeper into research, uh, except for maybe richard olan jesse's video on t towns and brown is a classic And this video with grush is a classic jesse is awesome and jesse just watched the program too. So I am so jealous of that, dude You made me do it. You made me do a 180 on michael. Dude's a hero. Yes, sir I'm i'm loving seeing everybody. I'm loving seeing everybody be so warm to michael in the chat. That's awesome Makes perfect sense. It'll be in the ocean. I also bet millionaires in general have been expanding there. So it makes sense Uh, they found a magladon or something. Yeah, I've uh started starting to really shift a lot of research into uh Subaquatic have you ever looked into nazis going to Antarctica to advanced tech and do climate control there? Do you believe they went? Uh, I have been I have not like serious research, but of course I've studied the the subject I think there was a nazi Antarctic submarine base at the very least right and of course there was a nazi presence near Argentina and so forth. So that is a really interesting avenue of research I i'm not too well versed in advanced tech like if they tried to research de klok or something like that for but, um Yeah, interesting good words from michael. I always encourage everyone to be highly skeptical on the subject too many people Looking to make money and sacrifice morals agreed Do you expect to see brand new whistleblowers in the new hearing? I hope so. Um I haven't heard any rumors or anything So I don't have much to add But I would really like to see some uh first-hand whistleblowers. Maybe carl nel Uh another person maybe carl nel grush and then two new whistleblowers with first-hand experience uh Okay, let's sorry Um Are there uap related topics you plan to avoid indefinitely? Yeah, just community drama. Um, I won't really ever get into community drama. I think anything else in uap Deserves a serious research of investigation. Um, so really anything. I mean we were talking about earlier I even have my problems with steven greer, but I Absolutely would talk to him. I'd cover him. Uh, I'd love to do it I will do a deep dive on the disclosure briefing document, but yeah everything but community drama I'd I'd love to cover. I'm trying to think if there's any specific people I wouldn't cover I don't know I have to think about that One theory I have is that aliens are just human animal hybrids grown because the time inside the craft goes by too quickly for any normal human to test Human animal the human animal hybrids that is a frightening Thought the time inside the craft goes by too quickly. That's an interesting thought you bring up My mind is drawn to an article that was published and deleted right before the congressional hearings in july of 2023 with david crush It was an article written by or featuring quotes by she hand that described a craft That a recovery team witnessed that when they went inside the interior was as large as a football field so That kind of subject of uh Spatial warps with uh with craft is very interesting Very interesting. Um These are hard These are hard uh to investigate and proof that her era case might be easier to prove Yeah, we're still there's still so much of the um indonesia experience where we're still Really actively investigate investigating a lot there Thank you rattle keep up the support for greb. Thank you. I appreciate that michael Scott castle interviews about his us. Oh encounter is pretty interesting surprise. It hasn't gotten more attention I have not heard of that so i'm going to write that down Awesome And then in about 10 minutes we'll sign off my friends But we'll keep getting through these uh questions and we'll we'll continue to uh, we'll continue to go through I've suspected there's probably an nh i presence for a while now kevin knuth seems to think that an organism can survive in oceans They can hop from planet to planet in planets that just have oceans. That's an interesting theory Of course with uap. There's also the subject of von neumann replicating probes If any of you guys have heard of the channel, um john michael godier. He's really physics based He has a podcast called event horizon. Check out his channel. He always talks about von neumann probes, which is a A method a type of self replicating probe that even like a sub facet than light civilization could expand into the galaxy and the cosmos So yeah, a lot of interesting things there Was roswell a real ufo crash? Um, I personally think so I think roswell is one of the most well documented crashes and my confidence in kingman has been growing by the day Growing by the day Edgar mitchell was from roswell. Some of the locals told him it was real. Yes. Yes. Absolutely Please have mh on again the fact he's here in the chat speaks volumes when there's new breaks in the case Absolutely with joey as well can't leave joey out of it. Nuremberg was debunked for me personally by richard dolan I think he does a great job of breaking down why it's most likely not a real event interesting Interesting, okay You told us you were an engineer what kind of field mechanical But over time do less mechanical engineering more like Service in qa when I was in university. I was told I'd be doing really cool things with math And that was never really the case. So that's unfortunate. But that's just how it is Um, it was fun to go to school for that Richard dolan's wife is a noted RVer if I ever get to talk to oh eras says that as well if I talk to dolan I'd love to hear more about that. I really would I really would Let's see Let's see Isn't this remote viewing known as astral projection related to the meditation and getting into a dream state Audits relevant here again if aliens are demonic doing remote viewing not going to be good. Yeah, I agreed there I think the relevance occurs just with Many claims now that's sort of like a almost like a conscious interface is needed for Interacting with craft and piloting craft But the extent of which there's some disturbing implications just like you've said Jimmy akin documented his participation in a remote viewing experience in progress He's not remote viewing but basically a hide-and-seek type experiment. That's interesting. I'm going to look into jimmy I Interesting thank you I love seeing you guys talking to um, I love seeing you guys talking to michael in the comments The half dome not a sphere. Okay. Okay Love course those book day after roswell. Yeah, I think that's just good reading You know with take it with a skeptical approach just like anything, but I think day after roswell is um, excellent reading excellent reading continue to think others are um I don't I don't know about that. I I've only ever had two people that have used My content, you know in the copyright tab of youtube and I they were just making like a compilation of different like testimonies and stuff That's fine. That's fine Jesse's interview with g han is such a banger. It's awesome. And I know he was teasing it for a while I remember right before he dropped it that same day a lot of people on reddit were posting What's happening with jessie's interview with with uh, dany protect jessie michaels. Yeah, jessie michaels is awesome The work he's doing is a sublime. It really is um Mr. T discuss in scalar waves Uh interact directly with the nucleus of an atom, which means they manipulate spacetime itself in very interesting Ordle chow you and jessie collab set you turn me on to this channel mh go um On jessie and I are discussing such things. We will see I will leave that to him to discuss Eyes on cinema has a massive library of classic ufo contents and is always adding new videos. Yeah guys I always recommend uh keeping notifications on for eyes on cinema just for the content they post you absolutely can't find anywhere else It's crazy If you were to give a skeptic friend a one to three sentence summary about why the uap ufo alien phenomenon is probably real good question You UFO sightings have occurred for centuries The u.s. Government has downplayed and lied about these sightings in the robertson panel in conden report Incredible whistleblowers have stated that The u.s. Government and private contractors are in possession of these materials Biggest emphasis on the second sentence. I don't need to think longer to get a better one. Sorry if this has been asked What up debat debat debabs? What is your educational background? I am not well spoken. I trip over my words all the time and blink all the dang time But I am a mechanical and I have a bachelors of science and mechanical engineering. So that is my background Is dan barish legit? I do not know I was going to cover him, but then um I think it was the night shift posted some really long stuff on it I haven't watched it, but I know that I think the guy's name is clint that does that channel I know he takes his work seriously. So I bet he's got some good stuff on that Um, I think he's probably he probably has a great stuff. I'll have to watch that Any thoughts on the physics implications of uap and the phenomenon so physics is uh, even though I'm an engineer This this may seem silly. I'm uh dreadful at physics like maxwellian physics was really really hard for me, but I mainly focus on the fact like um It's really interesting how these these crafts sort of defy physics in terms of this in their instantaneous Acceleration deceleration trans medial ability. It almost seems like they're about they create a space-time bubble around them that can dampen inertia to do such things and not splatter Whatever is in the craft in the craft themselves. So physics is the physics of the craft will lead that to kevin canuth Uh and his paper estimating flight characteristics of unidentified aerial phenomenon amazing paper highly recommend reading that But I am not good Interesting how the bitcoin expert predicted an uptick and disclosure activity once imminent dropped This includes the quiet endorsement from the wilson. Interesting. I didn't know that Thank you so much mr. Grover. I really appreciate that I wish you were jesse would solo or collab and amy escridge investigation If I do my video on mysterious deaths around uap and individuals amy escridge will 100 be in there. Absolutely Um, did you ever look into the am a reddit post about exo biospheric organisms from last year? Yeah, I did um I can't recall too much, but I remember that well Not well, but I remember that distinctly, but I need to um, I need to Re-reference that if my name is requested in the hearing. I will testify and support from those I'm working with that'd be awesome to see Michael testify awesome There were claims that the nazis escaped in UFOs to Antarctica if I recall correctly I don't know what to think about that. It's an interesting theory any theory about like a The nazi super weapons de Glock and so forth is very interesting. I personally don't have enough Confidence or confidence in any sort of research or backing to comment further Chris melan pinned a couple of your episodes. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no Chris melan released a signal exchange with somebody. I think he claimed was a high up a usg or Intelligence communities for us and they were discussing the kingman crash. This was on twitter I just responded with my video because I had just covered kingman briefly earlier and it got a lot of traction So the nazi thing isn't true. I don't know How do you yeah, Jordan? I see I've been done enough research. So I really don't have an opinion How do you sort through the crap without chasing rabbit holes? That's a good question Having a baseline of research and individuals to speak to when when I'm not quite sure about something or Kind of just need to keep my head clear run some ideas by people, of course and euphology. There's so many rabbit holes and kind of crap out there and Just kind of weighing the pros and cons of different people's testimonies and kind of just leaving footage behind I would say Opinions on reptilians that she had mentioned. I think that John Ramirez has talked about that too cia former cia agent John Ramirez Reptilians are a scary thought. I know I think this is very different than like the David Ike reptilian subject That talks about reptilians being obama and other politicians, but like just a race of most reptilians Beans and I you know, I must approach that with an open mind We have robert sarbacher and vanavar bush commenting on insectoid like beans, which is very scary to me I'm going to look up that power. I highly recommend it. It's on the dpi archive Just search powellek. I think it's there. It's it's just the full raw uncut footage. I really recommend it I meant graze on dmt as far as I can tell they fast-tracked our evolution have been here longer than we have That is uh, that's interesting. That's like the the machine elves, right people describe what they see on dmt Which are these Strange entities. I think even alex jones has commented on that Um Anyone know what happened to the forechan whistleblower the document is pretty interesting now that we know a bit about more about us. Oh, no idea what happened to the forechan whistleblower I I doubt when covering it. I'll be able to track down what happened to the dude, but I Absolutely am going to to cover the case Have you looked into the manipulation of the accepted historical record? Is this the the theory of phantom time that about a 300 year period between like the High middle ages like the 1700s or like the 14 to 1700 system exist and we're actually in the 1700s I have I've never really looked into that, but I've always as a young as a young and I found that very interesting I think the subject if I'm getting it correctly is phantom time I meant to say I suspected there's an nh. I present the oceans for a while now. I left it. Okay. I got you. I got you Nuclear power uap lore is the brainchild of dr. Knuth. Maybe I should talk to dr. Knuth I haven't spoken to him in a long time John von Neumann also worked on the manhattan project. Yes, he did did someone Uh Say Richard Dolan's wife is a sub No, I think Richard Dolan's wife is a noted a remote viewer people were saying a noted remote viewer No, it's was great aliens talking. I'm used to extract DMT Okay, so I think somebody said that this experience was just the DMT talking and you are talking about Um actual beans you observed Favorite bjj move any follow and whose lineage do you follow prefer sport or self-defense? Now that's a great question. I am from the hegan machado lineage under nobu yagai I my favorite move. I like ripping twisters I have been catching blue belts with twisters almost every day now and it brings me Incredible joy to twister somebody you get the twister hook you either banana split them calf slice or them twister them or take the back it's is Just a very sublime experience and I I would say sport because I also train mixed martial arts and uh judo And I have done some competing in jujitsu. So Self-defense is more the Gracie combatives and that I'm a large man. So I'm not a lot of people would probably try and uh Frankenstein choke me in the street. So mostly sports for me mostly sports I hope you can carry john max torch really hope you are real one I hope so too, man. One of my biggest passions besides crash retrieval is to speak to witnesses That's one of the biggest things. I know a lot of people Kind of feel uncomfortable doing that but I will go out of my way to try and speak to witnesses That involves cold calling and we saw how that went with witness tb We saw how that went Uh senior mechanical engineer for Cummins. Oh cool. My senior project in school was for Cummins We went to the factory in indiana. We made a spark plug durability tester. The Cummins guys are really smart very smart I find the varginia case very compelling. I might relate it to other Other cases and focus on more so the crash retrieval aspect because I know james fox already has a brilliant excellent piece on varginia in moment of contact I think russia's talked about the ufo that is way bigger when entered in one of the leak conference Yes, that was the wall street conference that occurred just after but the original article came out in I think june But he re-referenced that at that wall street speech. He gave to like 60 people that somebody leaked out some photos. Yes If you look up astral projections, some people report vaccine shadow people in that realm and sometimes they will hunt that sounds terrifying That sounds extremely scary Michael's story is extremely compelling. No doubt about that. I agree I can probably put a good word for you in Cummins. I appreciate that I I hope to I hope to be able to travel around full time for this someday speaking to um speaking to uh witnesses and so forth Opinions on reptilians same. I uh Approach that with an open mind I think there's probably a difference in the reptilians of david eich of the lizard people that are obama and hillary clinton Versus a type of a reptilian-esque species. I know michael schratt has Discussed this from the notes of lennard stringfield But same thing if robert sarbacher and vanavar bush have commented on an insectoid almost mantis like bean. I gotta keep it open mind Love the iceberg series. Okay. Here's what i'm thinking guys With lives, of course, we talked about some news today and we've had more fun What i'm thinking is if we do another iceberg we do it together in a live and we can um research as we go I'd like to keep the channel focused on investigations crash retrievals discussing witnesses and interviews If you guys like that and we'll find some time to do um Some icebergs together. I think that'd be a heck of a lot of fun Have you done any research on the horton brothers? I've never I have not I have not and i'm gonna write that down Thank you Yes, j. Allen heineck was absolutely convinced there was something to uh do this I love j. Allen heineck. He's very such an interesting person I've always found the fact that there were like 50 different radar recordings of the object going like five times Fast than anything humans had in the 60s to be very compelling. Yeah, including a verner von bran's mentor herman osberth A rocket scientist talking about upper bounds of ufo speed flying saucer speed being like 30 to 48 thousand miles per hour Hackology, what's up, man? They're plasma powered. That's how they create clouds the clouds also camouflage. I have heard that as well It's sort of like an mhd plasma. I have heard that as well um Some craft are invisible to the naked eye as they affect gravity. Yes, that is one of the five observables from uh lulizondo low observability Could you please uh link to the paper you mentioned? Yeah, sure. Let me throw that in the chat. Uh Sorry That's so many flight characteristics of unidentified Anomalous, all right. I've referenced this a few times from kevin canuth But there it is in the chat if you would like to like to watch Okay, um By the way, I know the people that wrote the post on amy eskridge that blew up on reddit and they deleted it the next day Do you know why they deleted it the next day? That's that is interesting It would make sense if they utilize some gravity creating tech. Yeah, I'm Even bob lasar has said that back in the day. Uh, maybe we'll cover him someday. Maybe Let's see. Um, sorry. I'm just uh, the paulic interview was crazy the implications of them trying to implant people on a massive scale And the tech what they can do it is the paulic Interview is very very consequential. I would highly recommend watching that guys highly recommend Um, the the grays live underground so that would be similar to phil schneider's claims Uh, michael says no problem. Have a good night. I'm off to work in a little bit. Keep up the support and keep tuning into kerb's channel Yeah, guys michael works his tail off I I've sometimes talked to him and it'll be like nine or ten at night and he's still at work So michael is very hardworking Will you start doing live streams going through ufo related info because I've seen some very interesting videos Documents and links to share with you. Yeah, absolutely Maybe what we could do just because I like I'm not the news of the day type guy I don't really care for um, like reaction type content. Maybe I know I've talked about this But I'll actually do it like once a week we can just kind of round up some Some news of the day discuss stuff because just as much as I want to give my opinion I want to hear your guys's opinion. You guys keep me grounded in my research as well Of course, just investigating solo can do some crazy things to your mind. So I do really appreciate every single comment you guys have nuclear power would merely Uh cover the energy output of the objects luminosity beyond that it has to be a completely different power source. Yes Uh, Richard Dolan's wife Uh is a lot more into the woo side and does remote viewing. They are interesting pair and complement each other well probably keeps them more balanced I agree. I agree Dolan. Dolan is fantastic I bet Davis was never under NDA about that memo. They were just pretending for whatever reason. I think yeah And I think it was also Edgar Mitchell now has it has been shown. He was under NDA okay, um That's exactly how real ets appear these days as orbs lights meteors like objects are just staying the other dimension because they are targeted with Scalar weapons when appeared in 3d the subject of scalar weapons in golden domes of she hand puts them to kind of Tech cloaked uap and bring them down is very interesting like I would definitely cover that Definitely cover that Uh, do you do these every sunday? No, but I should it's been difficult to find the time But if sunday's a good time that works for everybody I would I would love to Um, did your friends end up convincing you to try path of exile? No, I haven't been able to play too many games But what I have been playing is the black ops 6 beta So if anybody wants to play some black ops 6 when it comes out, I know that's a very casual take But reading so much. I need some games to just kind of melt my mind a little bit So if people want to play black ops when it comes out, let's do it. Let's do it live iceberg Okay, next week. We are doing a good, uh, a nice live iceberg. Okay guys, I'll find a fresh one We'll go through it. We'll have some fun Um, I get a coffee about the it was post-grouchy and they pulled it because concerned about family members and digging in a little too Yeah, the the the digging too deep can definitely be a concern or violating possibly violating any sort of ops sec operational security Is not fun. How do you find the time to go through all this do research and then do videos? um The research stage is Um is like a is a true gift. I love doing research for stuff Recording audio is another story and editing can be a slog But doing the research time flies by I could sit for 10 hours a day pouring through documents How do I find the time to do this? Fortunately, I have a very nice girlfriend that understands that how much this means to me Unfortunately, her dad is also huge into ufo. So she doesn't mind when I speak to to him about it Or she doesn't mind when he speaks to me about it. But uh, I'd say the biggest thing is efficiency and that's having a database of documents which I always try and have Have you ever seen the custodian file? Yeah, I have They've been recording u.p. He calls dragons. Yes, I have and that's that's interesting Again, I don't place uh too much on footage. Uh, just because there's so much footage out there and you can debate endlessly Uh, so I just kind of like to move on for Move on a little bit from footage, uh To me, maybe it's good to put in videos, but uh discussing it. It can just go around in circles Palak. Yes, watch this on the dpr archive. It was lc who brought this up super interesting He passed before the interview came out. This was in early 2000s I believe at like a just a middle age too, which is tragic like 50 or 60. But yeah, um So I I'd really recommend looking at palak I'd also recommend that you check out the study that was going on by the uh, tedesco brothers and donna nardo on long island Speaking of long island, that's a I can't wait to cover the 1992 long island ufo case near brookhaven national labs So that's an interesting place Who is my favorite ufo journalist? Leonard stringfield and ryan wood easily easily. Those are the two best magic eyes only and crash retrievals parts one through seven are absolute works of art absolute works of art Oh, okay searching palak implants puts uh, no so the google the google uh dpr archive the link system doesn't work So if you join in the the discord, I will let me I'll post one more link I will post that uh, once I get off once I get through these Comments, I will post that So I'll put the palak video Um, thank you man. God bless you too. I love answering the questions. It's a lot of fun Okay, everybody likes. Hey, have a good labor day too. I don't know how to say your name I will just call you attack on titan demon But yeah sunday sunday is great. Everybody loves path of exile guys. Don't Don't don't ruin my life. It's already tough enough to get to get videos out Just a tip. It's european 3m. Maybe do it earlier for more views. Uh, good. Yeah, I thank you for that I appreciate that. I know a couple people were saying they were in the uk and that it was a bit late Mr. Harry, thank you very much guys. I'm gonna get through these and then we'll we'll call it a night my friends Counter strike 1.6 my friend. Mr. T. W. Loves counter strike Loves counter strike and he is trying to get me into it The horton brothers were a part of nazi germany and project paperclip, but they were taken by the russians. Okay, that is interesting I would like to I would like to research that Uh, Leonard stringfield is unmatched. Yes. Leonard stringfield is his work is just beautiful. It is beautiful I hope one day I can go to his archive and in Cincinnati my hometown and and look into there It's list on the eoc channel too. Oh the paulic videos on eoc. Cool The custodian file situation is basically the answer to all this the team at skinwalker ranch kept having dragons fly by in the Intense gravitational field would drain their battery. I think I have heard that about uh, kind of Draining their batteries. I think I have Have you ever read corso's original manuscript for the day after ross? Well, it's pretty dry But it makes a lot more sense than the release book the publisher added a bunch of fluff to the book I have that document downloaded But I haven't actually read it because I didn't know there was a lot of fluff that was cut out So is that his uh specific affidavit because I will read that that sounds awesome Love from australia. Hey, thanks, man. As you can tell by the poster I got a lot of respect for the Aussies a lot of respect Almost someone with his eric mitchell overview would prefer to send Via discord dm. I will keep an eye out for the request once we hang up and I'll get all that stuff going And with that guys, I think tonight we will call it a night everybody who's been here Whether it be five minutes or the whole time we've been on for two hours and 10 minutes Thank you guys so much. Uh, it means the most seeing everybody commented. I love it I don't know where I'd be without you guys. So we will plan for Next sunday and right now we are in the research stage of a new video. I got like I'd say five or six immediate videos coming out one of them If I can get this individual to Speak would be a huge video. Uh, actually two people actually three There's three huge leads. I'm chasing down. I'm not going to spoil anything right now But I really hope I can cover these because they'll be awesome videos And with that guys everybody have a wonderful night and I will catch you all later.

Col. Philip J. Corso's claims of US Army Office of Chief of Army R&amp;D (OCRD)'s creation of a Foreign Technology Division tasked with handling technologies of unknown origin. According to Corso, the FTD sought to seed technologies found inside UFO crashes such as 1947 Roswell New Mexico into US industry for the expressed purpose of Bolstering the United States Armed Forces.</p> <p>For this investigation, we will conduct a full analysis of Corso's myriad claims and military history. This project seeks to leave his 1997 book \"Day After Roswell\" behind and study solely Corso's manuscript \"Dawn of a New Age\" as the best-selling book has numerous details and fluff added, likely by the book's co-writer, missing in the manuscript.</p> <p>Are Corso's claims of a US Army UFO legacy program seeding non-human technologies into US industry and armed forces indeed true?

Army Industry Teamwork is essential to the accomplishment of the Army Research and Development mission. To maintain superiority in our military arsenal, new ideas are essential. New weapons must be developed and perfected to meet new requirements. In these days of explosive advances in science and technology, Army Research and Development plays a major role in maintaining America's military supremacy. You are saying to the human race for the first time, an official intelligence representative at a high level from the US government is saying publicly, we are not alone. We're definitely not alone. Absolutely the data points empirically that we're not alone, yeah. You've said that we have the United States has spacecraft, intact craft. Do we have bodies? Do we have species? Well, naturally when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots. Well, the book is really my experience of as I lived them and research and development of the Army under General Trudeau, Arthur Trudeau, when he drew me back in and put me in charge of that and established the Florida Technology Division for me. These were the artifacts from the crash flying saucer, which we used the word applied engineering. Dr. Tello is still alive, knows he helped him. We fed these things. He gave me the job of finding industry or scientists that were close to these items and feed us to them in normal R&amp;D projects. And you're saying these items came from somewhere else. They came from a flying saucer. How do you know that? Because they were marked in the files that's coming from New Mexico. Roswell. Yeah, Roswell. Well, I think some came in might be another crash, but these were came from New Mexico and Roswell especially. And the General Trudeau gave me the job of working out a program, put these things out, feed them to industry, but there is provisions feeding it. They can have the patents, but they had to feed them out back to our house as a competitive edge of the Army and to the American people and the world as necessary. Before the 2023 congressional hearings on UAP, before the Schumer legislation and before Grush, the 20th century saw a decorated Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army speak and sign affidavits on the existence of non-human intelligence, crashed UAP, and exploitation of technologies of unknown origin. The legendary Philip J. Corso in his infamous book The Day After Roswell and lesser known but far more impactful manuscript Dawn of a New Age have cemented Corso as one of the most controversial yet credible UFO whistleblowers of all time. Lieutenant Colonel Corso central claims revolve around his time in the US Army serving as the chief of the foreign technology division where he claims he not only came in contact with autopsy reports of extraterrestrial beings but also craft and artifacts from UAP crashes and discussed how under his command technologies found in UAP were seated into US industry to give the army a competitive edge. But are Corso's grand and epic claims indeed true? And what can we learn from these claims? What valuable research can be extracted from the names, locations, agencies, incidents, and technologies mentioned by the late Corso? Hey guys it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we fully analyze and deconstruct the testimony of Philip J. Corso in his claims of UAP crash retrieval, NHI biologics, and reverse engineering of exotic technologies. Let's conduct a comprehensive deep dive into Corso ranging from carefully analyzing statements made in his manuscript to digging through his military record and grand claims. And some quick bookkeeping before we get started today. We are taking the global best seller the day after Roswell co-written by Corso and throwing it out the window. We will instead be focusing solely on Dawn of a New Age. The original notes and manuscript of Corso released in Italy in 2003 and the US in 2011 after Corso's death in 1998 at the age of 83. We will do this so we can directly study Corso's pure claims without the creative liberties taken in the day after Roswell, possibly inserted by the other co-writer Bill Burns. According to Corso's son Philip Jr. he originally had no plans to release his father's manuscript but did due to his father's distaste for the best seller. As relayed by Jr. Corso went through the day after Roswell and highlighted everything he did not say or did not like. He got solely halfway through before giving up due to frustration with the book. Multiple individuals were privy to the manuscript before Corso's death such as Colonel John B. Alexander who remarked on sensational details featured in the book missing in the manuscript. Due to the existence of the manuscript and Corso's son's firm remarks of releasing the piece to correct the mistakes in the book that made his father furious during his lifetime, we must give Corso the benefit of the doubt and study solely his unfiltered words. For example, the day after Roswell is 130 pages longer than Dawn of a New Age whilst the two cover roughly the same concepts. Day after Roswell adds in details like recounting the time when Corso intimidated the CIA director of covert operations into self-deleting, the manuscript features no such tale. Another example is the book originally shipped with a forward written by U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond who angrily recounted his statements once learning the book centered on UAP leading to an early copy reprint. While the manuscript makes mention of Corso's relationship to Thurmond no such advocation by the senator was ever mentioned. A final example I'll discuss is the missing first chapter from the book, The Roswell Desert, which describes the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash in painstaking detail and passes it off as an accurate description even though Corso was not present at this event. So feel free to visit the video description and download both the book and the manuscript and follow along as we dive into the claims of Corso. Philip Corso has as ironclad a background in the U.S. armed forces and military intelligence as does David Grush. Few other witnesses even with proven accolades in the U.S. military such as Roswell witness Walter Hott of the 509th bomb group come close to matching Corso's rank, stations and history. Lieutenant Colonel Corso served in the U.S. Army from February 23, 1942 to March 1, 1963. The young man initially served in military intelligence during Europe in World War II before becoming chief of the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps CIC in Rome. At the end of the Second World War, Corso arranged safe passage for numerous Jewish refugees out of Rome and served as personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini who would become Pope Paul VI. Corso also served diligently in the early 1950s throughout the Korean War, performing intelligence directly under General Douglas MacArthur as chief of the special projects branch of the Intelligence Division Far East Command. His work here would focus mainly on prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action MIA soldiers during the war, tasked with investigating North Korean POW camps and investigating the number of U.S. and U.N. POWs held at each camp. Phil would even testify in 1992 before the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs on hundreds of American soldiers being abandoned at these camps. Corso served on the staff of President Eisenhower's National Security Council for four years from 1953 to 1957. Skeptics and detractors of Corso claimed he was never a member of this NSC under Eisenhower, however. The 1992 Senate Select Committee hearing report would say otherwise, where the retired Lieutenant Colonel was clearly listed as NSC staff under the Eisenhower administration. We can also analyze Corso's own FOIAd military documents which show him as a member of the Operations Coordinating Board, a U.S. secret covert operations committee established in 1952 by Eisenhower under Executive Order 10483, which reported directly to the National Security Council. In 1960, Corso joined and shortly became commander of the Army's Pentagon-based Research and Development Program, the illustrious foreign technology division, under Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau. This foreign technology division is not the Air Force's infamous foreign technology division born out of the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This program stems from the Office of the Chief of Army R&amp;D and has almost zero trace or record outside of Corso's own military documents, and we'll discuss this much further later on. I do briefly want to mention some interesting context to lend to the credibility of Corso as we dive into his claims. Viewers of my channel will know of my recent interview with Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo, where Davis intimately discussed President and former CIA director George H.W. Bush's involvement with UAP legacy programs. Well, let's reference Jacques Valais' book, Forbidden Science Pacific Heights, which speaks on Eric Davis and former President Bush Senior's professional relationship. After a candid call initiated by Bush giving Davis advice on his future career, the two spoke again and saw Davis ask Bush about his interest in Corso's disclosures. Quote, could it be that Corso was mistaken in dealing with the material he was handling? Could that have been Nazi hardware? End quote. Shockingly, to the statement on Corso, Bush replied, quote, impossible. The two topics were clearly separated. By that time, all German secrets had been processed and filed away. They were not used as cover for anything else. End quote. Bush expanded on the 1954 alleged landing of non-human intelligence at Holloman Air Force Base, where allegedly Eisenhower and NHI brokered a deal. According to Bush, this event really did happen, resulting in a secret project with obscene security. When the two spoke again, Bush told Davis he was briefed on legacy programs by Trudeau at the time of the 1968 Mandel River's congressional hearings. The book says Colonel Trudeau, however, I do think this is a typo referencing General Arthur Trudeau. Bush senior claimed Trudeau told him his man Corso had been asked to testify before Congress and was able to reveal rumblings of alien hardware that had been distributed to industrial labs. The Corso testimony was squashed as a result of this conversation. And lastly, why did Corso wait until the 1990s to disclose his experiences with UAP technology? Well, this is because he made a promise to Trudeau. He would wait to speak until his death. What about the few people who are have criticized you to say, well, why are you coming out now? You're violating your security oath. What do you tell us? I've been asked that question many, many times. Number one is I had a nose with a general till we won't discuss this. A general said, when I die, feel your release from your oath. He died three years ago, and I started to write it. Number two is I couldn't talk about people over with us that I had no right to talk about. In intelligence, like a newspaper man, your source is not named unless he gives you permission to name him. I had no right to do that. And so my own family cruise on my son says, 35 years, you didn't talk. You didn't even tell us. So that's right. Why did I tell anybody? I had an oath was an honorable man, a great man. And I wasn't about to betray that oath. And not enough knowing that I had never any intention of writing a book or put that on paper. And there were in my mind a nice moment there. I never thought I'd write a book or even get a new movie on it. That never entered my head. Number two is I couldn't talk about people over with us that I had no right to talk about. Shortly before his death in July of 1998, CAUS, Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, published an affidavit released by Colonel Corso. This affidavit was signed for attorney Peter A. Gersten of CAUS in order to file a lawsuit against the Department of Army. This affidavit reads, quote, I, Colonel Philip J. Corso, retired, do hereby swear under the penalties of perjury that the following statements are true, that all times here and after mentioned, I was a member and officer of the defendant, that during my tenure with the defendant, I was a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council and former head of the foreign technology desk at defendant's research and development department, that on or about July 6th, 1947, while stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, I personally observed a four-foot non-human creature with bizarre-looking four-fingered hands, thin legs and feet, and an oversized incandescent lightbulb-shaped head. The eye sockets were oversized and almond-shaped and pointed down to its tiny nose. The creature's skull was overgrown to the point where all its facial features were arranged frontally, occupying only a small circle on the lower part of the head. There were no eyebrows or any indications of facial hair. The creature had only a tiny flat slit for a mouth and it was completely closed, resembling more of a crease or indentation between the nose and bottom of the chinless skull than a fully functioning orifice. That in 1961, I came into possession of what I refer to as the Roswell file. This file contained field reports, medical autopsy reports, and technical debris from the crash of an extraterrestrial vehicle in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. That I have personally read the medical autopsy reports, which refer to the autopsy of the previously described creature that I saw in 1947 at Fort Riley, Kansas. That the autopsy reports indicated the autopsy was performed at Walter Reed Hospital, which was under the authority of the defendant at the time of the autopsy. That the autopsy report referred to the creature as an extraterrestrial biological entity. Right off the bat here, it sounds extreme Corso claimed to have observed a mangled body he would later learn was a deceased bean from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. If you are not well versed with the July 1947 Roswell UAP crash retrieval, I do recommend doing some homework before continuing with this project. I'd recommend the Roswell cover up 75 years later, as well as my project UFO whistleblowers volume one to hear from some credible whistleblowers on the incident. For this video, we will be utilizing an array of interesting depictions of the crashed Roswell saucer. Based on reports and eyewitness testimony, Corso solely labeled the craft as the Roswell crashed saucer in dawn of a new age. We will explore all of these craft design in a future project solely focused on Roswell. One night, I was a post duty officer. Post duty officer means that I was in control. For that night, I was the one who checked all the guards, checked all security areas, fact checked the whole post. I was a duty officer that night. And I went to the veterinarian section and one of a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of the Guard that night. I told him, Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir. I told him, you know, they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of something sensitive here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look. And I knew this sergeant, where he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates there, like five or six, I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and floating in food. And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it back down and said, Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble. Because I'm the duty officer, I can go around, walk around here. But you might get in trouble for coming back. Just come on, let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him, where did it come from, Sarge? He said, well, five trucks came through here from an airfield in New Mexico, and they're heading for Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now, in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days, Route 40 was about the only cross-country route. And the route that they took was Route 40, going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas, and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force. And I said, well, stay away from the sergeant. I don't want you to get in any trouble. I told him, I can walk around and see them. So, and I started to figure, what was that? First, I thought it was a child, because it was small. Then I looked at this head and all, right away, and this was only half of the matter, secondly. Then I put the end back down, and the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body, it was gray. So, right at that moment, I figured, I don't know what this thing is. Corso's official records do indeed place him at Fort Raleigh at this date, and he would claim he was told the convoy of trucks hauling the bodies were headed for Wright, Pat, and came from Route 40. This is very interesting, as quite often Roswell reports state wreckage was flown to Wright, Paterson Air Force Base, were deceased by logics transported separately, and if so, why? Myriad UFO crash retrieval stories feature flatbed Air Force and Army trucks hauling wreckage away, such as the 1953 Kingman and 1965 Kecksburg crash retrievals. Also an interesting line, I'm sure many picked up. The body was referred to as an EBE, extraterrestrial biological entity, the same phrase used in the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual. This manual describes two sets of EBE, EBE 1 and 2. EBE 1 closely matches the description of Corso's observed body. This affidavit provides little more information than Corso gaining first-hand knowledge of the Roswell crash, but fortunately we have his entire manuscript to study. Just to revisit, the bulk of Corso's testimony revolves around the U.S. Army's foreign technology division serving to exploit technology of unknown origin, TuO, from crashed UAP and seeded into U.S. industry to primarily bolster the U.S. Army war machine and, as a second directive, benefit the U.S. economy. Through this program, we start feeding it out to industry, but this was not on paper. They went out as normal research and development proposals, not to name something. Yeah, you didn't put out a report that said there's some alien stuff figured out. We put our regular research and development proposal that came from somebody's brain, and also this was known among a select few, mostly combat officers head-to-head. It came, we kept this among ourselves, because otherwise we were certain that they were destroyed our organization and we had a good organization, General Trudeau pulled it together just a couple years before. They were destroyed our organization and labeled us as kooks and taken our budget away. So, it had to be. We didn't cover because we gave it to industry what the provisions, and I'll repeat this, the provisions were to come back to us with what you prove, competitive edge of the army, give it to the people and to the world if necessary, and take the patents. This claim dating to 1962 parallels extremely closely the modern-day disclosures that branches of U.S. military work closely with contractors under unacknowledged special access program in order to exploit technologies of unknown origin to primarily benefit the U.S. military. Let's monitor this evolution closely as we explore CORSO. It is endlessly fascinating to compare the secrecy and centralization of technology exploitation programs under the foreign technology division as outlined by CORSO. All the way to how these UAP legacy programs may operate today, stove piped and protected from congressional oversight nestled within various intelligence agencies and military institution in league with defense contractors, UARCs, and FFRDCs. Anyways, to the memo. After a brief forward and acknowledgement with the awesome statement quote, if one passage in these memoirs helps you survive in a troubled world, then all this work is not in vain end quote. CORSO begins an introduction for the reader. Philip begins by giving the reader valuable insight into the creation of army research and development projects exploiting technologies of unknown origin. And guys moving forward, research and development will now be shortened to R&amp;D and technologies of unknown origin will be shortened to TUOs. This sort of inception of a legacy UAP program gives us a framework to understand the construction and evolution of such programs. CORSO also quotes the father of German rocketry, flying saucer researcher and mentor of Werner von Braun, Hermann Oberth, who once stated quote, we cannot take the credit for our record advancements and certain scientific fields alone. We have been helped by people of other worlds and quote, 1947 to 1958 saw the disorganized dark ages of army research and development. NASA was founded in 1958, killing the army and DOD project horizon, which served to build a moon base. Atomic energy was stripped from the army and handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. ARPA, the advanced project research agency, was also founded clashing often with army R&amp;D. It wasn't until 1958, all army R&amp;D was pulled under one single department, the office of the chief of army R&amp;D. This was Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau, who handled all personnel, tech services, laboratory and installations as well as budget. Trudeau would then create the foreign technology division and designate young CORSO as its chief. CORSO would take quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign beans and events, those not of this world and quote, we will discuss this station and division in much greater detail later in the project. But for now, we are focusing solely on the manuscript's introduction. This led according to CORSO to the golden age of army R&amp;D from 58 to 63. However, in this time, the army still faced many challenges impeding their work, civilian control of space efforts, DoD opposers, adverse policy guidance and the animosity of CIA Department of State. This would all lead to the hyper secrecy of all R&amp;D data pertaining to areas out of this world. All of these materials were compartmentalized and trusted amongst a select few quote, great efforts were made to bring large industry and select laboratories into the army R&amp;D fold, end quote. CORSO also states quote, the partners we sought and gathered were US industry, a strong laboratory support and many leading universities, end quote. I do believe this small line is one of the most crucial aspects of CORSO's testimony, believe it or not. Quite often on this channel, we talk not only about contractors involved in UAP legacy programs, but also university affiliated research centers, as well as federally funded research and development centers, semi private institutions. One such organization created during this golden age of army R&amp;D is an FFRDC, I believe is up to their eyeballs in UAP legacy programs, MITRE. Officially established in 1958, MITRE was created by MIT Lincoln Labs employees, creating SAGE, the semi automatic ground environment program to coordinate radars to produce imageries of airspace for the military. A thesis I'd like to keep in mind during this exploration was the MITRE FFRDC created in part to fulfill the need of army UFO R&amp;D to see technology into US industry. Of course the foreign technology division was created a year later in 1960, however CORSO does state before his station at the new office, material exploitation efforts by the army had been ongoing since Roswell. At an undisclosed date, but presumably around the time or just before the creation of the foreign technology division in 1960, CORSO states the top 25 industries on the Fortune 500 list were contacted and meetings were arranged with their board of directors, top personnel with the chiefs of army R&amp;D. Laboratories were strengthened and organized, gathering funds to attract the best and brightest including foreign scientists such as those brought from Operation Paperclip. With contractors such as Bell Labs, who is credited with the development of the transistor and laser, two technologies CORSO said were leveraged from UAP alongside universities and army laboratories. This conglomeration, a powerful team, was tasked with exploiting TUOs. The guiding principle of this army project had but two goals, national security of the United States and protection of the American way of life. In a rare Art Bell coast-to-coast interview with CORSO and Colonel John B. Alexander, CORSO would state the foreign technology division began to operate with a budget of $2 billion. They weren't doing this gratis or for an investigation, you were commissioning them, you had budget money, research and development money that came along with these items you were giving them. We had a budget then it was tremendous, it was about $2 billion. $2 billion. We also gave out RDTAD contracts, research development tests and evaluation contracts. The first item that would be built from a research contract, we funded the building to the first one and after that other people and other agencies funded it. So we would fund these until it was actually developed. We had our laboratories, our atomic labs and the night viewing labs, where our labs at Fort Bell were. Colonel, what aspect of this were you overseeing? In other words, once you gave somebody a piece of this technology and a budget, what did you then do? This RDT&amp;E funding would equal over $10.5 billion today, quite the starting budget. The mention of R&amp;D test and evaluation contracts reminds me closely of witness Ed, who made claims of a joint UAP reverse engineering group operating between NELIS slash Area 51 and Edwards Air Force bases. After his service in the Edwards 412th group, Ed would work for USAF at the Pentagon serving on acquisition, integration and RDT&amp;E panel. It was here Ed would claim $34 and $40 billion were siphoned off in respective years to non-air force TOA transfer of authority funds. Here in the introduction Corso breaks down some of the breakthroughs leveraged from the foreign technology division and golden age of R&amp;D from studying reports and wreckage from Roswell and possibly other UAP recoveries. Let's go ahead and break these down. The first technology are image intensifiers, aka passive night vision devices. Corso stated the night vision laboratory at Fort Belvoir, Virginia created these first generation devices with aid from 48 US industries, all with varying knowledge of the project. Allegedly information gathered from the 1947 Roswell crash led to this breakthrough. Passive systems were indeed constructed by the US Army in the early 1960s. However, many individuals such as Colonel John B. Alexander challenged this statement. One of the most contentious technologies discussed by Corso is fiber optics. This point of Corso's testimony has been highly contentious like much of the materials. Allegedly at Roswell, the recovery team discovered what they thought to be a broken wiring harness with each loose strand and emitting a different color. These wires were fiber optics. Bell Labs allegedly utilized this technology to spearhead the greatest advancements in communication history. Now this point is contentious because French scientists were indeed working on early developments of fiber optic principles in the early 1840s. Bell Labs was involved in the development of fiber optics in the 1970s where they improved the technology and minimized loss on mass scale production. Now let's keep in mind, Corso does say some of the non-human technologies leveraged were used to bolster human technology, so perhaps this drastic Bell Labs improvement is one of these instances. And speaking of Bell Labs, let's remember back to the testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who stated that FFRDC's Livermore Labs and Sandia National Labs reverse engineered the propulsion system for the TR-3B alien reproduction vehicle. According to the Majestic-12 documents in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit report, Sandia has also served as a prime site for UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering operations. In fact, I have spoken so much about Sandia, I highly recommend committing them and FFRDCs in general to memory. The telephone company AT&amp;T was given managerial responsibilities of Sandia National Labs by President Harry Truman in 1949. As of 1925, Bell Labs and their engineering R&amp;D department was placed under shared ownership of Western Electric and AT&amp;T. Very interesting connections here. Another alleged leverage technology were super tenacity fibers from one single strand of fiber that could not be damaged. The Army at that time, according to Corso, had a tremendous need for fibers, for flak jackets, parachutes, and other military items. Important to note, dawn of a new age states these fibers were utilized to construct composites for stealth technology and civilian aircraft, while day after Roswell states these fibers were used to construct Kevlar, the material in bulletproof vests and made by DuPont in 1965. Strange molecular alignment techniques were additionally studied from the Roswell crash. The craft showed molecules down to individual atoms, had been aligned in various patterns resulting in incredible hardness and resistance to scratches, stress, strain, and shear in metals while all repelling cosmic particles and radiation. The Chief of R&amp;D of the Army thought this to be a truly consequential discovery and thus special teams were organized to investigate this chemistry. Corso stated this atomic rearrangement could lead to incredibly strong yet light spacecraft, but in 1963 and possibly through 1993 the Army had not solved this issue. I personally have heard some similar claims that non-human craft employ materials with interesting atomic arrangements. Corso also believed fluid application was leveraged from UFO propulsion and guidance systems. Fluidic principles led to the creation of the heart pump. Even though fluidic principles are quite old, they were not utilized commercially until about 1960 for the demand for reliable controls in space research. Two of the greatest technologies exploited by Army R&amp;D according to Corso were the transistor and integrated circuit. As we mentioned above, Bell Labs first introduced a point contact transistor in 1947. Jack Kirby of Texas Instruments introduced the first hybrid integrated circuit between 1958 and 1959. Corso's testimony illustrates a strange transistor with hair-like wires and leads and a chip in a stack of thin uniformly shaped wafer-like components found in a crash retrieval. Quote, these formed complete electrical circuits and developed into the micromodule concept. CRD said it would take 50 years to develop the transistor and 200 years to develop the chip. It came in a short span of five years, end quote. Corso does state this development occurred before the Golden Age of Army R&amp;D, 1958 to 1963, with advancements as early as 1947. As he states improvements were made to the existing technologies in 1959 with the introduction of miniaturization of circuits. In fact, when Corso began his service as special assistant to Trudeau in 1960, Trudeau would allegedly show in both transistors and integrated circuits and engage in some philosophical discussion on the implications of harnessing off-world technologies for human use. Perhaps this does indeed adhere to conventional history, which states physicist Julius Edgar Lillianfield proposed the concept of a field effect transistor, an FET, in 1926. But it was not possible to construct a working device at that time. It was not until 1947 we saw application of transistors. The Lieutenant Colonel also stated the laser, who many program members suggested was the EBE's method of communication over vast distances of space was derived from the Roswell crash. As we know, the laser, which stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, was created in 1960 under Bell Labs. And again, what was the purpose of all of this R&amp;D in Corso's own words, quote, to guarantee a superior competitive position given the superior data by the accidental discovery at Roswell, we reduce scientific data to a definite development to fulfill a military requirement. We never quibbled over who discovered or invented the development. The feeling was if a discovery was adapted to a concrete development, we would all be ahead in the game and the nation would benefit, end quote. This reminds me almost identically of the claims made by David Grush regarding secrecy of legacy program operations. So the reason for the secrecy exactly is what? Feudalistic dominance, who can have both asymmetric technology for, it seems like, just fueling the war machine. Grush says that through the 50s and 60s, encounters with the NHI continued, as did the cover up. Key to mention here, it is stated in the manuscript extraterrestrials never gave humans a thing. Not one scientific advantage came voluntarily. Everything was garnered by accident or perhaps force in some cases. This raises a very interesting point. Numerous individuals such as David Grush have flirted with the subject of agreements with humans and non human intelligence. If these agreements do not involve technology, what do they involve? And it's quite clear that you're talking about agreements between America and non human intelligences. Have we made agreements with non human intelligences? That's the kind of information I really hope national leadership is able to get to the bottom of. I need to pin you down on this. Are there agreements between non human intelligences and the American government? I think that's a question that I would like to know all the details of as well. Or is it possible R&amp;D programs were kept separate from other compartmentalized programs that inherited technology, a separation of programs I believe is active today? I think something that a lot of people don't ask that has kind of captured my attention. During your time investigating legacy programs, did you see much collaboration or compartmentalization between programs that may exist in Navy Air Force Army? It's too snowpiped or compartmentalized. You can't open it up to another one unless there is a need to do that. That need to get access is defined on a government form called the DD-254. And the DD-254 documents who has access and why and what gets access. And if you're going to have to get access to another compartmentalized program, then that has to be justified in the DD-254. And usually that's not justified because programs don't really overlap. However, Corso's claims NHI technology was taken, not inherited, mirrors closely the claims of Fluxliner alien reproduction vehicle witness Brad Sorensen, who was told at the 1988 Norton airshow the basis for the ARV the Roswell wreckage was taken without the consent of its operators. Another interesting parallel to today is a contractor Corso makes numerous mentions to, the Sparey Rand Corporation. Not to be confused with the Rand FFRDC, Sparey Rand was a major 20th century electronics corporation and military contractor. Sparey Rand was additionally named in General Trudeau's memoirs as a frequent spot for meetings. He would often meet with their CEO and directors to discuss Army R&amp;D projects. One such director was the legendary General Douglas MacArthur. Sparey Rand went defunct in 1986 and many of its divisions became part of Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Corso then goes on to mention a long list of other benefits garnered from UFO technology exploration. One I want to mention is anti-missile missiles for the Star Wars program. Long have I stated the Star Wars program, formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, had a secondary function to fund UAP programs and act offensively against UAP. There is indeed interesting research to suggest although the program was set in place by Reagan in 1983, Eisenhower established the program for UAP offensive action during his presidency. The Colonel discussed the need for protection against the EBEs themselves. The Lieutenant Colonel stated EBEs have performed acts of war with superior advanced equipment and superior techniques. The threat internally was treated similar to the Soviets as a fig leaf policy where the Soviets and non-human threatened existence but were not considered enemies. These acts included the controversial abduction phenomena and mutilation as well as quote spying on our atomic installations. Hindering missile and space equipment testing, hampering our military deterrent and nuclear deterrent, halting and interfering with exploration of moon and Mars, causing crashes of aircraft and casualties among military personnel and tampering with human and animal genome, end quote. I would like to explore some of these more controversial claims in a future project so let's hold on to this. This passage is key to reflect on as in the revelations of David Grush we have heard people have been hurt and killed by UAP but cannot attribute malicious intent to these intelligences. To conclude with the introduction, Corso placed much admiration for the individuals behind exotic R&amp;D. These veterans of World War II in Korea were entrusted with the United States government's highest level deepest secrets. Now that we have spent over half an hour investigating the introduction of the manuscript, we can start to dive in and explore more of Corso's claims in depth. Throughout the introduction of this document, we heard Corso recount for the reader much of his early military career but quickly let's recap some of his highlights right before he met General Trudeau in his own words. Well your career to the to the point that you meant the general was a very honorable and fairly normal military career. It was in comp at this time because we were fighting the war in North Africa in Italy and then I joined the general. I went to Korea last time. I participated in the Korean War and I joined the counter staff over there and I came back and when I came back to the pages I joined Kevin Heidenhaal as one of the military in the United States with the White House and there my career for the team I was in the White House for four years and from there I took command of of the military defiant, the army's military defying range, the White Vans and then I took the command of the Germans and I became I stayed in command 18 months and then I became Secretary General of the Army and from there I came back to the United States and General Trudeau had reorganized research and development of the army and he sent for me and I joined him as a special assistant and chief of the forces of the division. Corso claimed his military career saw him earn nine clearance levels above top secret up to the coveted eyes only material for the White House NSC matters. Achieving these clearances is when Lieutenant Colonel would claim he became aware of UFO information though nothing pertaining to legacy programs or reverse engineering since his NSC position occurred from 1953 to 1957. We can wager any interesting UFO information was presented to him as Intelligent Staff O for the Operations Coordinating Board attached to the National Security Council. Corso claimed his superior and the President Special Assistant C.D. Jackson along with President Eisenhower himself were the only individuals aware of Corso's clearances. C.D. Jackson here is Charles Douglas Jackson Special Assistant to Eisenhower and Government Psychological Warfare Advisor. Jackson served as liaison between the freshly minted CIA and the Pentagon. Jackson was also a member of the Committee on International Information Activities. Corso did discuss how in officer school he began specializing in air defense and ballistic missiles. Twice during his command of missile units unidentified objects were picked up over New Mexico and Germany traveling at over 3,000 miles per hour. Corso was ordered to destroy any records and tapes. Following service as commander of the 71st Missile Battalion in Germany and Inspector General of the 7th Army, Corso was led to become Special Assistant to the Chief of Army R&amp;D Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau quote. If Edwin Teller could be called the father of the H-Bomb, General Trudeau could be called the father of the ballistic missile end quote. And now we can get into some of the very juicy details. In 1960 Corso entered into his position as Chief of the Foreign Technology Division having seen a small strange body while also being read into some unknown UFO information due to his clearance levels and had been told of some exotic technologies leveraged from off-world technologies by his mentor and boss Arthur Trudeau. But I do find it strange Corso does not write about the 1947 non-human intelligence body encounter in dawn of a new age as we observed and assigned affidavit. This is especially strange because this encounter of biologics was relayed in the book day after Roswell so I guess let's go back and hear this story recounted in Corso's own words. And I was instructor at the intelligence school and we had an aggressor force that I was. Though one night I was post-duty officer. Post-duty officer means that I was in control. For that night I was the one who checked all the guards, checked all security areas, in fact checked the whole post. I was a duty officer that night. And I went to the veterinarian section and one of a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of the Guard that night. I told him, Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir. I told him, you know, they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of something sensitive here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look. And I knew this sergeant very, he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates there, like five or six, I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and floating in fluid. And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it back down and said, Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble because I'm the duty officer. I can go around and walk around here. But you might get in trouble for coming back. Just come on, let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him, where did it come from, Sarge? He said, well, five trucks came through, I'm coming through here from an airfield in New Mexico and they're heading for Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now, in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days, Route 40 was about the only cross country route. And the route that they took was Route 40, going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas, and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force. And I said, well, stay away from Sarge. I don't want you to get in any trouble. I told him, I can walk around and see. So, and I started to figure, what was that? First, I thought it was a child because it was small. Then I looked at this head and all, right away, and this was only happened a matter of seconds. Then I put the end back down and the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body was gray. So, right at that moment, I figured, I don't know what this thing is. So, like an intelligence business, I just better put it on back of my head here and wait to maybe in the future, I get cooperation so I can evaluate what it is. As Chief of the Foreign Technology Division, the young Lieutenant Colonel would receive, quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign beans and events, those not of this world, end quote. He would spearhead a team of Nazi scientists brought over from Operation Paperclip, as well as US scientists and technicians. Some of these pieces of technology were known to be from crashed UFOs, while others were educated guesses. Corso did recognize his position arose almost exclusively from his close relationship with the infamous Trudeau. In fact, Trudeau personally gave Corso what is now famously known as the Roswell file, a box of materials and files pertaining to the infamous crash. I opened it up and I started finding the material which he called later, Corso's Jump, and there was a bunch of wires, which I didn't know what they were, which were immediately colors. I didn't even know if they were wires. I had this chip, this integrated circuit, a laser instrument. They could do like some of the fine cuttings that they save in manual simulations. And I had also fiber optics and I had those and I recalled them. We started that because one of my, and I had reports on autopsy that performed a law to read on our lab, which we financed the law to read. And when I read that, it matched with what I saw for roughly 14 years before. The whole autopsy was similar, what I'd seen. So then I start putting two and two together and gradually these items will start, and then the general called me and said, work out a program. Find scientists who are working on these things and shove them in there. I told the general, I have to study these things old because really, I told him, I'm not that bright. I don't know what these things and all of these things are, but they're important. He said, well, Phil, they are important. Give me a program what they are. Anyways, after Corso was designated as the chief of the foreign technology division by Trudeau in 1960, Corso was given four subjects to keep track of. One, foreign development of this world. Two, foreign intelligence and developments not of this world. Three, act as interim project officer on select R&amp;D projects and four, all other duties assigned as special assistant to the CRD for the US Army. National security measures meant points one, three and four fell into normal categories, but point two was a whole different matter. Many experts in the know felt the army was helpless in the face of NHI technology. Let's briefly touch on some more technologies and items featured in the Roswell report given to Corso by Trudeau. We have yet to discuss amongst the physical technologies and reports on artifacts such as a paper thin high strength metal found at the Roswell crash. Corso discovered autopsy reports discussing beings almost identical to what he observed in 1947. Accompanying images show decomposed bodies roughly four feet tall and medical reports detailed heavy variations to human anatomy and organs as well as skin and bone composition. These biologics heart and lungs were very large with a remarkably different muscular structure. The beings appear to have skin and bone structure built to protect vital organs from cosmic action, cosmic radiation or gravitational pull. And it is interesting, according to the manuscript, a transparent film over the eyeball of the deceased EBEs led to Trudeau mandating the pursuit of passive night vision technology. Analyzing every single file he had on the Roswell crash saucer, Corso did notice some odd discrepancies between the beans and their craft. The files had no mention of food or nourishment for the beans in the craft nor mention of water or drinking water or water for cleansing the body. The files made no mention to refrigeration equipment, no mention of medical equipment besides what the recovery crew guest was a first aid kit and there was no toilet or waste disposal facilities or no rest and no recreation facilities. Corso and the OCRD believed these beans to be clones or at the very least expendable creatures sent by some sort of intelligence. The chief even believed the Roswell craft to be a reconnaissance craft that would return to a mothership for necessities. The Lieutenant Colonel also reasoned possibly this species had solved gravitational time dimensional travel and could instantaneously return to their base. Throughout the manuscript Corso would often hint at multiple UAP or crashed flying saucers analyzed. It is frustrating we don't get a total count besides confirmation of the Roswell crash as well as the 1947 July San Augustine New Mexico crash in which allegedly a flying saucer crashed with no seams, joint lines, rivets or weld joints. This is a ubiquitous description in almost all UFO crash retrieval reports. So when I start putting all this on the extraterrestrial together and finally gave it a name I told them it looks like you know these are clones and so the name came out extra extraterrestrial biological entity that's what we figured they were better described than we never used the letters ET there was no such thing. He said that they look like clones how they're clones not look like clones they were clones we figured that they were created by some some other intellect and we also came to the decision that they were made to specifically the travel in space because we knew in those days that man could not travel in space some bones are affected his muscles are affected his brain is affected man cannot travel in space so we came to the conclusion that these creatures whatever they are are made to travel in space and gradually through what work we did we found out that disintegrated with the flying saucer and with you because most of the failures making by saucers were the guidance system that this creature was also the guidance system was part of the engine of the flying saucer it is also fascinating to see how the team was inspired and attempted to study harnessing brainwaves to control aircraft and anti-missile missiles this inspiration came from apparent discoveries that these extraterrestrial biological entities were part of the craft's guidance systems this may seem like science fiction however we do live in an age where consciousness connection is indeed discussed with UFO craft piloting and we came to a conclusion even in those days that these were the reason most flying saucers have failed is because our conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system he's part of that saucer i've just had one of the most senior scientists in the u.s defense department former admit to me that he was read into a ufo crash retrieval program i've spoken to well over 20 people now what i was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing and they are not in a position to be able to engineer it yet because it's just light years beyond what we have it's a completely new type of physics is what one person said to me and you might be interested in this jay because of the sort of direction that your interests have taken without expanding on it expanding on it one of the people i spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind interface connection with the engineering that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or some kind of intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding shockingly we can add even more context to these claims by analyzing the files of the legendary lennard stringfield and take a look at a report of a possible recovered vehicle or alien reproduction vehicle that utilized headband transceivers to operate quote len spoke to a mr. hines who had a source from bell labs the informants stated that he was on the flight line at a california air force base in the early 1950s and saw a ufo retrieval brought in he allegedly saw a cutaway of the recovered craft plus the headband transceivers worn by the aliens anyone involved with the retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search apparently one man must have kept a part of the craft and he mysteriously disappeared he was never seen again the source feels that the man was eliminated end quote chief corso somehow stumbled upon information that the soviets were running their own parallel to you o exploitation program this may have stemmed from soviet spies in new mexico tipping off stalling to the roswell crash where stalling allegedly gathered the ussr's rightus to discuss the captured saucer quote some of the items found and analyzed by the russians possess a similarity of items gathered in the united states others closely resemble material collected by the us army soon after the crash end quote impactful statement as recently dr eric davis confirmed the soviets did indeed observe and collect at least one crash retrieval in their own territory it is unknown how exactly corso came across this intelligence regarding the soviets but it is no surprise after the words of david grush grush says the united states is not the only country that's encountered nhi and their technology he says our geo political rivals have their own crash retrieval programs which they are also secretly exploiting for military purposes we're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it's a it's a multi-decade cold war that uh has been under our nose for so long and you know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to this subject however far down the line in 1993 corso would ask old acquaintances to acquire about recovered materials from a kgb general while much of the information held as top secret by kgb and gru corso was given a list of materials you can see on screen now let's temper our expectations as this list could easily have been disinformation given to corso however one piece that stands out to me was a silvery tube found in the us in 1975 i wonder if this possibly relates to the august 1974 chiwawa mexico crash i covered in which a us rapid recovery team relieved a deceased mexican army squadron of a recovered craft possibly the soviets traced this recovery and found materials missed by the convoy the foreign technology division was working with lasers anti-missile missiles and directed energy weapons near the tail end of corso's career lieutenant general trudeau retired in 1962 and the lieutenant colonel followed him shortly in 1963 now what more can we learn about the foreign technology division and general arthur trudeau trudeau is a member of the military intelligence hall of fame the general served in world war two in the korean war trudeau served as chief of army intelligence but was relieved by alan dolas director of the cia possibly for his extremely rigorous anti-communist stance the general was shortly reinstated and eventually in 1958 the golden age of army r&amp;d began according to corso trudeau would then return to washington as director of army research and development the general was so influential to the army he was one of eight former generals included in the army's 1970s oral history project funny enough when trudeau was interviewed for this project corso was found to be spending time with his friend trudeau in his kitchen this speaks to the close relationship of the two and their friendship during and after their service and outside of corso we have only one interesting piece to link the general to uap let's remember all the way back to forbidden science where dr eric davis claimed bush senior stated he was indeed briefed by trudeau at the 1968 mendel rivers congressional hearings now i'm sure many are familiar with the united states air forces foreign technology division that operated out of right patterson from 1961 to 1991 to reiterate the office created by trudeau and chiefed by corso was not this infamous division the air force program evolved from air technical intelligence center in 1961 and was a sign under air force systems command the division reportedly operated on recovered russian mig jets however due to the stove piping of ufo legacy programs it would not be shocking to think perhaps this program also engaged with technologies of unknown origins parallel to its army department let's reference us army colonel john b alexander's book ufo's myths conspiracies and realities i know i've had my problems with alexander before and his discussion of the som 101 majestic 12 special operations manual however this quote is important quote corso stated that he had been transferred back to the pentagon under trudeau and a division had been created for him called the foreign technology division this is not to be confused with the large foreign technology division of the u.s air force at right patterson ohio it was learned that the army foreign technology division was formed as corso stated and then disappeared shortly after his retirement end this is a fascinating point as after general trudeau four star general dwight e beach took over command of army rnd and from there on out we find nothing of foreign technology division why is this army rnd office proven to exist yet zero foya documents newspapers or online articles exist about the correct program numerous references can be found to the air forces foreign technology division but not the armies i find this very similar to the army's interplanetary phenomenon unit which was discovered through foya to exist only throughout institutional memory in the army i do believe this inability to track down the army's foreign technology division to be of extreme consequence if corso's testimony is indeed true there is much value we can extract here regarding uap legacy program operations this would mean the office of the chief of army rnd created a very real program hidden and shadowed from the public eye by the publicity of its big air force brother at right patterson throughout the manuscript corso would even comment passively on this difference stating project moon dust and blue fly reported materials and intelligence directly to the air forces foreign technology division out of right pad and we can do some really interesting research by reading a primer on research and development in the us army we can see in 1958 under trudeau the army established the army research office under the ocrd due to pressure from civilian scientists which served as a single contact in the army to maximize army rnd efficiency remember corso stated army rnd truly began to flourish in 1958 when army began doing rnd away from civilian and institutions with prime eyes one can then reason the foreign technology division may have run parallel to the aro army research office out of civilian and congressional oversight this reasoning can be further supported when the document states the army chief of rnd would have a parallel line of authority to handle technical services on matters in his area this would in turn give the chief of rnd trudeau authority on assignment of key personnel and allocation of rnd funds to technical services this rnd primer document also reveals some startling revelations the army's initial needs for managing rnd efforts led to the creation of university research initiatives u r i's independent laboratory in-house research i l i r and independent research and development programs irads some of you may remember irads as a funding mechanism for legacy programs mentioned by david grush furthermore these u r i and i l i r programs would eventually lead to u a r c and f f r d c two types of military and federally controlled semi-private groups that likely operate heavily with ufo legacy programs what a fascinating document there is absolutely more to explore here such as the thesis of how legacy program architecture was born out of army rnd i do want to spend some time visiting some of the smaller aspects to corso's disclosures we glossed over discussing the manuscript corso additionally made some extremely interesting claims regarding some information he gathered long after his service corso allegedly learned that in february of 1987 colonel herald e phillips of the defense intelligence agency chaired a pentagon group called the ufo working group this group apparently still in existence at the time of the manuscripts writing in 1993 originally consisted of 17 men one army and three air force generals di a scientists an army colonel three nsa officials a supervisor from the cia's domestic collection division as well as a technical team from the cia's science and technology director it well for one where is the navy here as the navy is likely up to its eyeballs in ufo legacy programs such as the off-world technologies division housed at the naval surface warfare center in crane indiana it seems strange that between 1987 and 1993 corso and his ufo working group intelligence source would not know or not make mention to the navy's dealings in uap legacy programs but let's go back to the mention of the cia's science and technology directorate and how it is of extreme importance here by numerous accounts the cia ds and t is where the quote unquote ufo portfolio is held according to eric davis as well as chris sharp and many others the director of this position glenn gaffney was the individual who stopped lockheed martin from divesting uap material to osap in 2008 additionally former cia ds and t deputy director dug wolf helped create the cia office of global access in 2003 which was accused by excellent journalist chris sharp as serving as a logistics coordinator agency alongside jsoc joint special operations command for uap crash retrieval corso was way ahead of his time to make mention to this this ufo working group according to corso also received funding from us army inscom intelligence and security command founder major general albert stubblebein in the last few projects i have done i have talked at length about stubblebein and his likely work in uap legacy programs including fort hachuka in the 1960s stubblebein was also allegedly the man who tried to pay off steven greer in the 1990s and the alleged founder of the nsa's men in black treat tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team we'll skip over this for now as we cover this in-depth with edgar fuchet and the flying triangle arvs but for now how about this inscom special forces unit the illustrious intelligence support activity isa was handed over to jsoc in 2003 the same year wolf constructed the cia office of global access which allegedly used jsoc for uap retrievals isa is often known as the most secretive and clandestine of jsoc units even outside of the ufo working group just how intimate is us army inscom with legacy programs and does this working group not sound very similar to a majestic 12 leg structure let's take this time to briefly point out another distinction between the book and the manuscript in day after roswell claims are made of working adjacent to roscoe hill encoder and the infamous majestic 12 personnel list under eisenhower and truman dawn of a new age sees corso recognizing the eisenhower briefing document report but how he never saw the report at the nsc and white house the vast majority of criticism against corso comes from analysis of the day after roswell and his claims of technology ceding the lieutenant colonel's military accolades are beyond question we have already addressed the stark differences between the manuscript and the book the book clearly added myriad details to spice up the story of corso the manuscript is well it's tough reading but it gives us an unbridled look into corso's experiences the manuscript was also completed prior to the release of the day after roswell colonel alexander and others were shown the completed manuscript around the time of the book's release while alexander jock valet and others are still very critical of corso's they all maintain the lieutenant colonel's story never wavered details were never altered added or subtracted corso sounded like a tape recorder you could rewind or fast forward to parts of his disclosures and always hear the same details never any wavering allegedly corso had but 24 hours to edit the day after roswell book which led to no oversight on all the creative liberties in the piece one must ask why the subject of this non-fiction book was stripped of all creative control of the project in his book john b alexander details a letter he wrote to corso about all the issues related to the day after roswell mind you these criticisms are all leveraged towards the book still interesting to keep in mind and i highly recommend looking at this nonetheless link in the description many discrepancies regarding technology seeding has been thrown at corso some of which we have already addressed jock valet for example well versed in computer science stated corso's assertions regarding integrated circuitry were not documented facts colonel alexander himself had specific issues with the passive night vision system mentioned by corso alexander stated the genealogy of infrared and nvg technology can all be accounted for alexander detailed how he spoke to the director of night vision laboratory at fort belvoir virginia dr lou cameron who flatly denied how an eye lens of nhi aided in passive night vision breakthroughs legendary researcher stanton freedman was also extremely critical of corso associating him with bob lasar which in my opinion regardless of skepticism against corso is very inappropriate freedman criticized corso for his grand story absent of evidence this is a viewpoint i can absolutely empathize with but what does stanton have to say now entirely differently in terms of background lieutenant colonel philip j corso came out with the book on the 50th anniversary of roswell first published right in roswell called the day after roswell in which he claims that when he was at the foreign technology desk of the army research and development command at the pentagon under general trudeau he surreptitiously slipped the filing cabinet full of advanced technology wreckage from roswell into the hands of american industry and he saved the world that's how we got kevlar and micro integrated circuits and a whole long list of things and uh it was a great story and the forward of the book was by senator strong thurman the oldest serving member of the senate who said nice things about corso but in his intro his forward says nothing about roswell in his manuscript and book corso was indeed what you could describe egotistical but in his memoirs he never once claimed to have been some sort of world savior he was very patriotic and simply aimed to strengthen the army this is obviously not freedman's fault as the book was his only available analysis on corso at the time well they make a very long story short when you start checking on colonel corso lieutenant colonel corso things just don't check out he provides no validation for any other claims there's no index in the book either they say new documents finally released there's nothing new in there uh and many people have gone through i know one phd who was a colonel in the military who sent me a list of 92 false claims made in the book 92 i mean just technically wrong all over the place well you can blame that on the co-author maybe but uh some of the discoveries of physicists just won a nobel prize for example for work done three years before corso was connected with the army research and development group he's a nice gentleman i met him while he was alive uh but his claims senator thurman withdrew his forward wasn't in the next edition of the book because it was written for an entirely different book about corso's activities corso talked about the fbi his good buddy hoover when his fbi file was released uh hoover had nothing but bad things to say about corso now it muddied the waters and got a lot of attention why would such a distinguished military man well the real military people will tell you he only made lieutenant colonel after 22 years in a lot of lieutenant colonels not nearly as many full colonels so it's another example of taking advantage opportunism if you will uh he also claimed that he was a member of the national security council and a sworn statement for a lawyer was going to go after the government and spill out all colonel corso's files well i checked with the eisenhower library not only was never a member of the national security council which is very prestigious indeed he never attended a meeting of the national security council he was a liaison between the security council and some other groups uh it doesn't help ufology to have this kind of thing going on people accept a great deal and his book sold well but i'm sorry it isn't what it claims to be it's not a real expose of the truth about roswell and flying saucers and government's new technology cut now in july of 2024 john greenwald and the black vault published documents released by the fbi on corso and no no documents discussing ufo's a portion of these documents pertain to in 1964 to 65 fbi background check on corso for his perspective position on the immigration and national security subcommittee of the house of representatives corso had allegedly provided some unfounded claims in the past according to these documents delivering a list of fabian socialists to his good friend arthur trudeau the fbi was unable to validate these claims corso was also investigated for spreading claims garnered from cia sources that lee harvey oswald assassin of jfk was an fbi informant now oswald being either an fbi or cia informant probably does not seem too unlikely to everybody regarding a soviet defector michael gullinowski the fbi document state quote another government agency has characterized corso as a parasite who has never produced any intelligence through his own efforts but has profited from information developed by dedicated government agents and investigators end quote all of these critical files on corso were cross references and not main files meaning the fbi never officially investigated corso from these files it does appear corso liked to quote unquote waste the fbi's time making accusations no content here actually discusses his duties with the foreign technology division let alone the army and of course it is odd the selection of documents released when they were released why are there no documents on corso's army position and why are there no documents on the foreign technology division my greatest issue with corso arises from a massive firsthand experience relegated to the very end of his manuscript remember corso claimed to have witnessed an extraterrestrial body in 1947 observed ufo's on radar at ballistic missile sites in 1958 and 1959 and eventually studied materials recovered from uap crashes for the foreign technology division corso's affidavit says as much without reference to the nike missile site encounters however at the end of this manuscript corso recounts an incident while in command of a missile silo at white sands missile range corso claimed while driving alone in an isolated area he sought shelter from the heat in an abandoned mine within the mine he claimed to have encountered face to face a bean of non-human intelligence the bean was drawn in corso's manuscript and communicated to him telepathically we can also see him relay drawings of this bean in a long lost interview featured on weaponized with george nap the bean wished to leave the surrounding area however active radar interference from nearby installations were preventing its craft's departure a common theory by corso and some roswell researchers is radar systems interfered with craft navigation leading to crashes i am still very skeptical on this point corso asked the bean what he would get in return for lowering the radar coverage the bean responded quote a new world if you can take it end quote corso would then grant the beans wish when he returned to his installation this experience was so profound to him he would often contemplate the meaning of the statement during life corso would even relay this story to john b alexander george nap and possibly others including a film to his grandchildren somehow danie she hand saw i i found to be extraordinarily important the the little eight millimeter home movie that uh that uh kernel corso actually uh produced to be shown to his grandchildren after he died uh this this is this i i found to be extraordinarily persuasive that he and i got to see the film uh but it wasn't supposed to be shown till after he died and uh and i was shown the film uh and it shows him talking to his grandchildren saying that even though i'm gone now i wanted to make sure you understood this and what he did is he talked about the fact that back in 1945 in july uh when before we had even dropped the bombs on her ocean in nagasaki while they were experimenting with the nuclear bomb uh out in the desert at ala migordo and white flats uh that in uh new mexico he he in fact was one of the the security officers there uh and he said that they were seeing ufo's he told his grandchildren uh from the from the grave basically on the bit on the little eight millimeter home movie that he had been there and that saw the ufo's and that he took a lunch break to go leave and went off into the hill somewhere to go to lunch and he saw one of the craft that had landed uh it had been somehow disabled by the radar that was up all around the proving grounds uh and that he had a direct contact with the ufo occupants of the vehicle and they they communicated to him telepathically to please take down the radar just temporarily to allow them to flee uh and he actually did that he told his grandchildren he went back and as a range officer ordered them to shut down the the radar for just a short time to do some kind of recalibration of it and at that point the ufo craft fled uh shot off into the sky now that's that's corso talking to his grandchildren in a in a private never intended to be made public uh eight millimeter film and so i found that quite convincing about corso uh so when corso reports that he was actually put into possession of some of the technology that had been recovered from the raswell crash i tend to give it a considerable amount of credibility and the fact that the the various uh aerospace uh corporations tried to set forth some sort of a long explanation about how they really developed the silicon chip they really developed the fiber optics they really developed uh the other uh technology that corso attributes to the raswell crash that's exactly what they would do there's not any doubt about it that they would obfuscate and they would try to construct some sort of an alternative explanation for how they developed themselves this technology and so i'm just saying that uh i find the corso uh a testimony more credible than many people do i must be very clear here how shehan is indeed incorrect about the 1945 date corso claimed this event occurred when commander of the ballistic missile firing range at red canyon part of white sands this station was in 1957 to 1958 my issue here is this is a truly consequential encounter if true initially i believed this passage to be a dream or metaphor until i read more about how many others corso would tell this story to unfortunately this is an issue that plagues much of the ufo realm witnesses stating disclosures then adding well and then this happened and then that happened far after their initial disclosures one would imagine such an intimate encounter with a non-human intelligence biologic would be featured in most of corso's disclosures make of this passage what you will however it does leave somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth that such a dramatic encounter is relegated to the very back part of his manuscript hey guys it's uap kerb thank you so much for joining me as we took this 90 plus around 90 minute deep dive into the claims of lieutenant colonel philip j corso now before we get started and kind of give this conclusion a lot of the time you'll see corso mentioned as colonel philip j corso i have never once been able to verify that corso was indeed a full bird colonel so thus i try to stay true to what i know as fact and what i've seen on his military records and call him lieutenant colonel philip j corso so the reason i took on this project quite often i'll see people either pro corso or anti corso and much of their arguments crux on the day after roswell book a lot of the people who disregard corso or put away his claims have a unsavory taste in their mouth from the day after roswell whether that be to some of the unsubstantiated and wild claims such as um corso forcing a cia guy to self-delete or some of the egotistical megalomania of corso in the day after roswell book about him being a world savior and just some of the uh perfect synchronicities of you know perfect descriptions of the roswell crash and rosco hillencoder and the majestic 12 so i wanted to take a step back and read the pure manuscript dawn of a new age of corso this is a 176 page manuscript if you ever watch this video again if you're interested i do recommend reading the full thing however it is a very dreadful read most things are talked about eight or nine times throughout the manuscript so it can just be a trudge to get through now i do notice that there are still some differences between corso's affidavit and the dawn of a new age manuscript and this being the description of the encounter at white sands in 57 and 58 which we just touched on in the end of the video of encountering a non-human intelligence with almost a different physiognomy to the bean he claimed to have seen at fort riley in 1947 so that that description still leaves a bit of a strange taste in my mouth due to reading it after about 120 140 pages into the manuscript at first like i mentioned i did think it was a metaphor a new world if you could take it something to teach his grandchildren to learn from but corso is alleging that this is a true incident he not only wrote this in a film in his manuscript in a film to his grandkids that somehow she hand saw but also told john b alexander joc velay and george nap about this experience so let's kind of dive into some of the things i found very interesting because i do think there's a lot of very credible statements made in the manuscript now i cannot speak to the veracity of the technology ceding claims um i'm not an expert in integrated circuitry i'm not an expert in computer science i'm not even an expert in metallurgy that was one of my worst classes material science in the university so i cannot speak to that that is why i tried to put a balanced take of course those claims and some traditional history but what we can speak on is some of the factual accuracies of us army r&amp;d at the time you know i know we analyzed that primer quite a bit so it was fascinating to see kind of the army's need for a centralized r&amp;d project under trudeau spearheaded in 1958 just like corso said that's when the golden age of army r&amp;d began it was also very interesting to see back in the late fifties and early sixties the us army was trying to kind of get with semi-private institutions and universities in order to um flourish under army r&amp;d this is something that we talked about quite often f of rdc's and ua rc's and reverse engineering programs and legacy programs utilizing these sorts of institutions for probably material study uh and so forth and also the foreign technology division this is something i think is one of the most crucial aspects of this video that i've seen almost nobody else talk about the foreign technology division under which corso worked was us army not air force this is not the infamous foreign technology division out of right pat now we can ask ourselves why is there no information about this foreign technology division why can we see nothing about it except in the actual military documents under corso uh i myself have some foya documents out to try to investigate for this further but as we've known with the interplanetary phenomenon unit with the us army there are some weird institutions that somehow exist through institutional memory i'll be interested in to see if i can pry anything free from foya regarding the army's foreign technology division however my hopes aren't necessarily high that being that if this was indeed one of the first structured us legacy programs i'm sure we'll get no information and i do want to touch on that because if corso's claims are indeed true and i look favorably upon the claims of corso we'll just say that there's some claims that still bewilder me like the nhi encounter and so forth but this program started in 1960 would likely be one of the first structured us legacy programs utilizing corporations you know bell labs and some of the fortune 500 companies as well as universities and semi-private institutions so if these disclosures and testimonies are indeed fact we can extract a lot of interesting data and worthwhile investigation here seeing how legacy programs were structured and framework and that is something that could extend to today which i find highly likely seen as i do believe in modern day or at least the early 2000s the army's role in legacy programs has often been r&amp;d to try and equip the modern warfighter with um reverse engineer technologies of unknown origin there will be a lot more to discuss on that in the future and hopefully as we move on over time we can try and crack into some of these legacy programs and and talking exactly what about the army air force navy does and what contractors work under them and so forth speaking of contractors sperry rand wasn't that an interesting details the memoirs of trudeau and discussed by corso one of the one of the companies they met with often was sperry rand and when sperry rand went defunct i'm doing this off the top of my head which i believe was 86 much of their information and engineering divisions were bought up by rathion northrop honeywell and i believe rathion as well as bell labs i think one of the most interesting connections here is bell labs being owned by atn t who in turn owned san had ownership of sandia national labs under mandate by truman sandia is a usual suspect mentioned in the majestic documents mentioned by edgar fuchsia mentioned in the interplanetary phenomenon unit documents that are still disputed to this day so there's a lot of interesting data here to kind of analyze a hypothetical or very much real us army reverse engineering program and speaking of that i'm also so fascinated by corso's discussion of the ufo working group wasn't that interesting mentioning the cia directorate of science and technology having a major position on this group of about 17 18 people on the board as we know with the work of chris sharp thank you chris sharp if you ever watch one of my videos i'm honored you're you're an inspiration but that in 2003 cia oga served as a logistics coordinator for ufo crash retrieval with the help of jsoc as we have just analyzed the cia directorate of science and technology doug wolf spawned the oga and then us army inscom and founder major albert major general albert stubble bind who corso said funded the ufo working group under inscom in 2003 the isa the intelligent support activity known sometimes as the activity the most clandestine of jsoc units was given over to jsoc and this was all in 2003 around the time of the oga's creation which is allegedly the time the oga served as logistics coordinator for crash retrieval if you don't know much about the isa i highly recommend watching some videos on them they are some uh true bad people in terms of just their training and so forth are really interesting i'm always interested in learning more about jsoc but i do want to know what everybody thought about the video and corso after analyzing his claims in a vacuum purely analyzing his claims without any of the nonsense and extracurriculars from day after roswell what does everybody think let's get a discussion going if you do not know i have a discord come join that i'll have the link in the description uh we'll probably have some conversations going on about corso and so forth because i would really like to talk about that if anybody has any experience or other information on the foreign technology division let's get talking because i think that if you take one single thing away from this video i i would like it to be that the army had an rnd program in the 1960s called the foreign technology division that there are no documents and no data for all we know is that trudeau followed upon his retirement in 62 by dwight e beach forced our general um we're in command of us army are indeed the office of the chief of army research and development so there are some kind of clues there for us to work on further but i hope everybody enjoyed this project we're coming up on a year anniversary of the channel i got something a little fun to to revisit for that but thank you all for tuning in again i'd like to know what everybody thought i got a patreon in the in the channel description um i don't gatekeep any content everything i do is for the world to see um so if you want to support the channel only support what you think the channel is worth with that being said guys we will get working right on the next project and i shall see everybody soon please remember to like and subscribe and thank you so much for tuning in bye everybody</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/_sv0Otxtcn4/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li>

If everybody can hear me, Towney, 3057, I appreciate that so much, man. If everybody can hear us, just say something in the chat. Let me know. Uh-oh. I think we're good. Yes, we can hear. Okay. All right, cool. Let me say it again. Towney, thank you, brother. I appreciate that a lot. Welcome, guys. This is the first live stream I have ever done. I'm here with Joey. This is his first ever public appearance, and there's 30 people here already. So, coming through loud here, you're being here. Yeah, thanks for having me. This was like really crazy. So, I've been here for a few days now, and Bruce Buffer to introduce you. Real quick, yesterday I made Joey watch a fight night, and he was craving Bruce Buffer's sweet voice and his awesome suit, but keep going. Curb is a huge UFC fan. If you guys don't know this, it was quite wild to be on the couch with him watching it. But yeah, so, you know, after, what's up, Bertie? A year of, hey, Xavier, I see you there. After a year of investigating Michael Herrera's case, so, I'm Joey is not your name on Reddit. You know, I've been investigating his case for about a year now. Finally, for the first time, took the trip to Denver to meet up with him for the first time, and luckily, Curb here is in the area and was gracious enough to host me. Yeah, so, we've just had a packed few days, and with this live stream, what we want to do is just kind of like recap, you know, how the last few days went, some of the things we did, and of course, you know, talk about our experience with Michael. Yeah, and any questions you guys have? List them in the chat. We'll try and get to everything. So, the story kind of went. We have been planning this trip for a couple months. Now, of course, I've said this in some comments. I don't know how many people have seen this, but I've been pretty public about this. I actually got to meet Michael a couple months ago. And so, I actually took him out to dinner. He's in Colorado. Y'all know I'm in Colorado. So, we actually got some food. So, this wasn't my first time meeting Michael, but it was Joey's. And real quick, Boxie Brown. Yes, if you see the poster in the background, I stepped that made this for me, and I love it. And Joey, on my main table, we go grab, oh, if you don't mind, you got UFOs. Sub last night from Michigan, Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob was our strange times. Don't forget that you can click on that. We'll get to that. Joey made me this, guys. Isn't this sweet? And you know what? He didn't ask for the logo or anything to not let me know anything was up. So, he made this from his own hand, which is insane. As far as getting banned for UFOs, let's, Joey, can you unban this man? What is this? What is he saying? He says he got banned from UFOs for mentioning the Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob Lazar. Oh, I see. I don't know anything about that. So, yeah, I'll have to look into that. Bernie wants to know what Joey thinks about Nathan. We will absolutely get to that when we talk, when we kind of mention it. We'll start so kind of the weekend on Friday, Joey was here and we met up with Michael for dinner. That's when we were originally planning to do the first live. And right after that, we've, sorry, just looking at some comments. Sorry, guys, this is my first live. So, if anything's a bit sloppy, that's probably why. But Friday night, we met up with Michael for dinner. He is a business owner. So, we went to one of his videos to film an interview. And right now, we have all the footage. We use three cameras. Joey has some incredible gear. So, it's very professionally recorded. I think we got about like four hours of footage. I think it was less than that. I think scallions, maybe two and a half to three hours, I think, of footage. But yeah, we set it up in one of his conference rooms and set up a few different angles. We have like a tight shot on Michael. Kind of felt that was important to kind of get his reaction to, you know, questions that, you know, as they were being asked to him and kind of close up. But one thing that was really cool, do you have the paper? The drawing? Yeah. So, at one point, you know, when he got to the craft, we were like, hey, can you just like draw this? And so, we've got this really cool kind of sequence of him going through, you know, kind of his memory as he's drawing this. And so, I thought that was kind of neat, you know. I want to give a quick thank you to scallions. I really appreciate that, brother. And Bernie and Rob here, if you, like, not agreeing with Michael, that's something that's totally all right. This case, you know, Joey and I have discussed this at length and discussed this with Michael. It's a, and somebody in another Discord asked a really pertinent question, like, what is, why is it so hard for a lot of people, like including myself from the get go, you know, but my first video I made on Michael, I was super skeptical about it. You know, why is his story so hard to believe? And I totally understand a lot of the skepticism around Michael's story. It's a, it's a really weird story, especially kind of factoring in like the huge UAP and Black, about Black program operators, as well as kind of being contacted by the insider and so forth. So, one of the things that I wanted to do with this interview, and Joey and I had talked about this a lot, is I found in other appearances from Michael in interviews and also Nathan's appearance, there was still a lot of confusion around Michael's Indonesia case. If I remember correctly, from Nathan's appearance, there was a lot of confusion for people who don't know these things. It was Michael's team leader at one point, and he was on the same deployment to Indonesia, and he recently was interviewed by Patrick on VETA, and he doesn't believe Michael. He thinks Michael's lying, and he provided, you know, his testimony, as well as a photograph that he claims shows Michael, you know, kind of prepping to go into Indonesia with him. And so, that was something we brought up to Michael as well. There's like a camouflage match that, you know, was brought up. And the fact of the matter is, I saw some discussion about this. Nathan was Michael's mission operation, like in the field team leader, that, you know, a question. I see some people saying like, you know, is he a plankman? I think Nathan's just a team leader that doesn't like Michael at all. Well, no one really, honestly, like no one liked Michael in the platoon. The thing that was so crazy for me, like meeting Michael for the first time in person, I mean, obviously, like over the past year, I've gotten to know him. It was just like a profile picture. Like, I've gotten to know Michael over the past year, but like meeting him in person, it just struck me that he is not at all the person that Nathan describes from 2009. I've also had the opportunity to speak with a few other people from Michael's platoon who knew him back then. And he's just a totally different person now. You know, he's like a completely remade person. And there's some, you know, he had some personal struggles after he got out of Marines that you can listen to his total disclosure interview. And he kind of goes into that. And it just, it just really makes a lot of sense. So he kind of hit rock bottom and just had this, you know, someone off in his head to like totally change his, his life. And I just, I just had like a totally positive experience. Like, as far as his character and his mannerisms and, you know, just like going out to eat and being polite, so polite to the, to the staff and just attentive, you know, in conversation and stuff like that. So that was kind of one of my big takeaways from, from meeting him in person. And so with the, with the, the Nathan's testimony, I found a lot of factual inaccuracies just from the time that interview was released with Nathan. A both vetted and Nathan were kind of pressing that this mission happened that night. It was like some secret night mission that didn't, that wasn't anything Michael had ever said. He'd always said this was a daytime mission. They said it, similar to the Arrow historical report this had to do with extraterrestrials and aliens. It did not. I had a couple other issues. But just like, I agree with some of the cases, there's some of the claims that Nathan was a little dismissed. Clearly does not like Michael kind of talking about how Michael would spend hours in the gym and just was a weirdo would take walks by himself. So for this interview, we really wanted to nail down a lot. Jim, Jim, thank you so much. I will get to your question in one second. We really wanted to nail down kind of a lot of the details of kind of Michael's story, including because one of Nathan's strongest claims is that he was on mission with Michael. And there's no way Michael could have gone on this UFO mission. So you'll see this in our interview, but Michael has stated before he was stationed on the USS Denver in Chow, preparing officer meals and so forth. And we really tried to nail down the time period that this volunteer mission where he ended up observing the UFO, he says he observed the UFO happened during one of his shifts in kind of the Chow Hall. This approach recruited us just to volunteer for this mission. This wasn't with his normal kind of team leader and fire team. This was a put together rag tag kind of group of volunteers, especially. And was kind of a off the cuff mission to the point where, remember, Mike was an M249 saw gunner. And here on this mission, he claims he was handed an M16A4 200 Norwegian Kronath. I know that. Thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Also, Norway is one of my favorite countries on the earth. I was just in Oslo last September. But so just kind of ironing out some of those details. And before I continue, you have anything to add? I think one of the other inconsistencies was like, I think it was stated that like they saw the UFO from the LZM, but they didn't see anything until they got to the top of the hill. But yeah, the other questions, I mean, really addressing Nathan's stuff was kind of just a small part of the interview. A lot of it was focused on things that I noticed like small details or kind of gaps in time of his testimony where he might have skipped from one thing and kind of like went to the next thing. And there, you know, maybe there was like a half hour in between that kind of is fuzzy, you know, that he has never talked about. And so I tried to identify some of those areas that would help kind of add context to the situation. And we also talked about the inside. Yes. One of the things I'm really glad Michael talked about in this interview because he's only kind of mentioned it kind of halfway or just in passing, but he actually told us the story and did it live. We'll have it in the interview kind of how he came in contact with the insider because he's just said before, oh, this insider contacted him. If we remember to the NPC 2023, that was June 12. June 9th or 10th is when the Daily Mail article came out. That was about Herrera's story. Pre Greer's NPC 2023, there was actually a three day kind of closed private event. And that's where Michael first gave his testimony in a private setting. And it was here that the insider was at this event. And once Michael gave his testimony, Michael says that the insider kind of talked to Greer said, I know what this is, let me try and connect with Michael. And after a little bit of phone tag with Greer and this insider, they finally connected and this insider invited him out to this location. That is so infamous now, kind of the most infamous part of Michael's story. Yeah. And for me, so you guys have to understand when this was all unfolding, I was in direct contact with Michael. First of all, he told me this insider wanted to meet him. I was like super skeptical. It sounded like what are the chances you have like a UFO witness, and all of a sudden, someone in the black program is going to wants to meet them. So I was super skeptical, but I had a phone call with him the day before the meeting. That phone call has since been, we've published that on the video that you and I did together a few months back. I kind of hear a clip of that video, but in it you can see like I was given certain details about the location and timing of that meeting. And ultimately, I was able to obtain some evidence that proved Michael was on a specific helicopter. And so I was able to track that helicopter without Michael's knowledge. And I could see exactly where that helicopter went that day. I didn't tell Michael about this, you know, right at the start. You know, once he got back, I spoke with him and said, you know, I started asking him some questions and, you know, asked him like what time does he remember them taking off stuff like that. And just like everything was lining up. I also, well, so one thing is at this point, you're fully kind of read in on all of that evidence. Yeah. So, A, thank you so much. That's a cool name. And I appreciate you so much. That's so kind of you. But B, the kind of a, yeah, let me, let's get to this to kind of, but so a lot of this evidence about that initial meeting was a helicopter kind of a visit to this location. Joey was able to track down with multiple pieces of self-confirming data from kind of publicly available flight records. And I like, I don't know how much I want to say about it. So you tell me some of the pieces that help that. Yeah. I mean, the reason why it might have to be vague about like the main piece of evidence I use is like the nature in which it was obtained could kind of compromise certain things. So, and it's been really frustrating for me, you know, at the time, you know, I eventually revealed to Michael like, hey, I tracked the helicopter and he was like, holy crap. And, you know, at the time, I felt it was important to reach out to certain people, you know, certain journalists, certain like podcasters, things like that. And just explains him to them that like, look, Michael's not lying about this insider. Like this meeting happened, you know, like, I can't prove the insider is who he is. But I know he went to this location that's like, I know where he went. Herb knows exactly where he went. And it's, it's like a very interesting location. Yeah, that's what makes things so weird because there's still a lot of like people and still a lot of valid thoughts about, you know, is this guy disinformation? Like I totally understand that point of view. It's totally, you know, that's kind of where my mind drifted initially to puzzle the helicopter. But Joey also, what's the question? The helicopter equals insider. Okay. Can you name the location, Bernie, Rob? I cannot. That's not my, that's not my location. So, well, let me, let me address this question here. So I'm not, you're basically kind of saying, like, am I taking evidence of a helicopter to mean that I know the insider's real? No, that's not, that's not it. It's so initially it was the nature in which he took him to this location just said to me that this guy at the very least has to be some sort of high level person to be able to take him where he took him in the nature in which he did that. But now I have, I mean, we have like third party corroboration of this insider from multiple very trusted people. Yeah, it kind of overlines that. If you guys watched my, my witnesses one video with the story of, and that's what I'm talking about, Doug Way. And I linked that YouTube video that's kind of talking about Area 51, stuff being moved to Doug Way or Weiner. Let me get to that in one second. But thank you so much. But in that documentary I linked it shows like random citizens pulling up to Doug Way, right, which is this location is not Doug Way, but random citizens being pulled up to Doug Way, getting approached by men at arms, being held at gunpoint, being approached by Apache helicopters. If this was just some random dude taking Michael to this location, they would have been pulled up on and probably detained because it is a, it's not a Starbucks, right? Like he didn't get introduced to Starbucks or something like that. Real fast, before we keep talking about that, Ort Weiner, no, I have not heard back from TV. I will probably not be talking to him again unless he becomes a, but yeah, I'll probably just let him, I don't, I don't really want to infringe on his privacy anymore. But keep going. Yeah, so when I started reaching out to these different, you know, journalists and podcasters who, you know, and I wanted, I just wanted just to say like, Michael's not lying about this one thing, because I felt like it would just elevate, you know, kind of the stand that like the base level of trust, instead of just kind of, you know, just, you know, interviewing him or talking to him without having that information. Now, unfortunately, I had to censor kind of key parts of that evidence. When I was doing these, these calls with these people, most of them, there's a couple, I did share the full evidence, and they were able to verify it and know the location. Verb here now, at this point, Michael has, you know, given him the trust to be kind of like fully read in on that. So I'm like, I'm, I just have such a relief and weight off my shoulders to finally have like someone else, other than me, just being like, yeah, guys, trust me, who has seen the full picture of, of like evidence of this meeting, who can kind of, you know, talk about it and be like, yeah, I'm not an idiot. And like, do you think the insider has proof that Michael is saying the truth or the insider just trusts Michael's story? Michael has said that the reason he was taken to this location is because the insider told him he would be shown proof to corroborate his story. And I think that's probably like a pretty fair guess, guess to say that, you know, some elements of Michael's story he felt were corroborated. Bertie, I do want to tell you this, this insider, I do not think it's in Taylor. Yeah, so no, just to, just if I could address this question to you, I think 100% the insider knows Michael's telling the truth. Like, like, if the insider is who he says he is, like, just logically, it doesn't make sense if he wouldn't, if he didn't believe him. And the whole thing is like, the insider allegedly, you know, is familiar with these types of operations. And that was, you know, one of the reasons why he wanted to, you know, build a relationship with Michael. And actually, this was one of the questions I had during the interview with Michael was like, why did he need or want you to kind of have this relationship and stuff. And so Michael kind of goes into that. And it makes a lot of sense, in my opinion, you know, kind of why they have this sort of mutual relationship and what the insider is getting out of it from Michael. And I've struggled and grappled with this, just Michael's whole story so much. Because if you guys remember the first video I ever did, a couple months ago, I straight up still told I was extremely skeptical of Michael and didn't, didn't, kind of didn't believe him over time. And especially talking to Michael, some of the, some of the confirming elements of just meeting the insider and so forth is so strange to me. I, I don't know kind of what the, the future of this entails or really the, the consequence this holds to Michael or even what he saw. I still don't know that I really would like to know, but it's such a weird story. And I think in this, this interview, which I saw somebody asking, was it going to be out? I'm trying to add it all right now. So I will get it out this week. But I, I just feel like this week, I know, but the people want to see it, right? I want to get this video. I'm so excited. But it's just, it's such an interesting story. And I really do understand it. So I want to touch back to why some people don't believe the Michael story, but the craft, Bernie, the craft he saw was a pretty, was octagonal, kind of octagonal shape. Yeah, throw that up there. I mean, this is just a sketch, but yeah, there's, there's some better drawings and kind of renderings of, of the craft that he described. Oh, we also, sorry, I don't want to track. I was just going to say, Oh, okay. How much do you trust Steven Greer? That is a loaded question. How much do I trust Steven Greer right now? Probably a two. How much do I trust Steven Greer's database and just people who have contacted him? Because most of the witnesses that I found and so forth just reached out to Greer, not contacted him. High confidence in a lot of those people. But Greer, I've made it well known. You know, maybe I haven't seen it for myself. So I don't know if the CE five is, is legit or anything like that. I don't know. I, that's weird. That's kind of strange to me. But I don't think, I think, I think Greer's got a huge ego. I think he just kind of wants to possess his own witnesses. For example, Michael talk, I think this was on the total disclosure podcast. But of course, his story came out through Greer. He kind of maybe would have gone through different routes if he knew now, but he specifically mentioned Greer either purposefully or mis-purposefully lying about his case. When he's had the men of black operators, when they were pulling guns on them, Greer had said overdramatized the story saying that the men made the Marines kind of get on their knees, turn around, guns pointing back to their head, like almost a movie level of kind of drama. And so this happens with Michael and who knows what other people he's talked about. It just kind of stretches the story, but just stretches things a little bit. I think, I think if Greer eased back on the ego a bit and trying to grift people for thousands of dollars for CE5 stuff, he'd be taken home more seriously. But he's just an enigma to me, man. I don't know, because if you guys have read the 2001 disclosure project briefing document, that's what, I think that is really a document, runs it back. It's fantastic. And so that was in 2001 and 97. Where did he go wrong? That now he's trying to command Lordship or people who contact him? I don't know. And also, like if you go through the, if you go through the DPI archive, some of those documents he's uploaded, and I kind of felt guilty about pulling through some of these, say they're protected by Dr. Client Privileges. Why is he posting this stuff? It's immoral. It's absolutely immoral that he's doing that. And sometimes I feel bad looking through that stuff, but I don't know, man. I don't like it. Interesting to know if Michael has talked about masonry or if you have any thoughts on that. Michael was wearing a masonic pin and he outs talked to us because of course that's so interesting. He just kind of told us that he joined masonry because he kind of liked the kind of wealth oriented mindset and joining the group of people and so forth. So for him, he wasn't a native mason like family wise. I don't even know how joining masonry works, but he just joined pretty young, I think at 18. At 18? Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, he appreciates a lot of the history behind it. And he's talked about, he's kind of addressed the conspiracy theories and stuff like that and on kind of other interviews and whatnot. But yeah, I mean, like the wealth aspect, like we toured his business and it's an incredibly complex organization, yeah, incredibly impressive. It's an eight figure business just by looking at it. It's about no other panel. Oh, yeah, I don't remember what that was. He addressed that on the total disclosure. Okay, I need to check it out. I checked where the pity was wearing. Yeah. But we also talked about Kirkpatrick. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, guys, this is gonna be really great too. I live in a birdie. If you're in Kentucky, my pops lives in Pendleton. I'm out there all the time. I love Pendleton. So I'll get to this in one second, but Arrow. So yeah, Michael did testify to Arrow and in the interview, he talks at length about that. He testified directly to Kirkpatrick and we'll just give a little details. He, this Jimmie, is that okay? Can you thank you? And I really appreciate that. The last time, I'm splitting that one with you, man. I don't want anything. I really appreciate that. Thank you so much, Jimmie. I really appreciate that. That is so kind of you. Seriously, from the bottom of my heart. But Arrow, so he testified directly to Arrow. There were a couple people in the room. Michael said that Dr. Kirkpatrick sat lean back with his legs crossed the whole time, asked three questions about Indonesia, three questions because he testified in April of 2023. So before the NPC 2023 with Greer, he said, Kirkpatrick asked three times the same question. He said three questions, but they were the same question. He didn't type anything down. He just had some handwritten notes. After that, Kirkpatrick and Arrow told him they would be following up and they never did. He never heard from them again. And he was also surprised and pretty angered when he saw historical report volume one and saw that it was completely kind of falsifying his testimony to Arrow. You're supposed to like, as a content creator, you got to like leave teases. You spoiled it. But still, you got to stop. I don't want to. See, that's what I like about you. You're not like leaning into all the like kind of work. No, I'm not going to do trailers. No, it's awesome. He thought Kirkpatrick was a total jerk. So yeah, the question was like, who were the operators? That was like the one thing that he was focused in on. He didn't ask anything else. This, for what, yes, I've tried to find that person. That's in the emails. Also, tried to talk to John Stuart. I've heard some kind of positive and negative things on that encounter. So I really am trying to get to the bottom of it, as well as the strange connection to the 1974 Chihuahua Mexico crash retrieval case. I want to cover it. That occurred in Cuyome, Mexico in 1974. Supposedly a crash, UAP, a disk collided with a small Cessna airplane. Mexican authorities retrieved the craft. A United States kind of insurgency team killed those people and took the craft. So that's all I know about that. I know data, anything to back that up now, but I will cover that case. Bernie, yes, if you've seen the disclosure project and you've seen witness A or B, I can't remember which, I'm trying to find that person. They said he was Boeing and locking Skogwork. So I'm trying to track down who that person is. I know his name because it's actually listed, not redacted in the, in the career files, which is crazy because if you read the disclosure project, it says AH, that's the name, AH, but in the career witness list, his name is unredacted. So I won't hide that. If somebody beats me to finding him, fair play. But yeah, I'm trying to track down that guy. I have a friend of a friend whose father's management Skogwork's in the 2000s. Bernie, Rob, if you want to talk about UAP, tell him to contact me, please. Yeah, it's been, it's been so cool to just kind of shadow over Gerb these past few days. I mean, I think within the span of like a few days, like you've made like two new contacts, have had conversations with, you know, some, some witnesses. Like it's incredible. Like the hustle behind here, it's just, it's, it's really cool to see. Yeah. So I might mention this in another video, but if you guys are watching, I would like to tell you about something that I found. Another one of Gerr's witnesses I made contact with, this guy's actually a PhD professor at a university, completely vetted his credentials, not a first-hand encounter, second-hand encounter. But let me tell you about the second-hand encounter. I have no more data on it than just speaking to this gentleman the other day. He's actually a good point of contact. He's actually in Colorado, so I'd like to talk to him more. But when he was in university for his PhD, are we going to see Michael in documentaries or hearings? We'll get to that right after this story. While doing, while getting his PhD, one of his professors was an army electrical engineer. And this is Jim, Jim, Jim there. Jim. Wow. Thank you. You were, I'm just wondering, all right. You like $100, $100 that note to Joey. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Jim. That's incredible. Thank you so much. But so this guy has a second hand encounter, right? His professor in university, getting his PhD, used to be in the army core of electrical engineers. He used to be an electrical engineer in army engineering. So he told me back in the 50s, early 50s, I think this might be 53 around the time of Kingman. Hey, I'll get to that in one second. His professor, while a little liquored up at a party one night, said that one night in the early 50s, in the middle of the night, he was woken up from his bunk. From his bunk, he was placed in a bust, driven hours to an airstrip, but in a plate with no windows. If you remember so far, this sounds oddly similar to Arthur Stansel in the Kingman crash. He's put in this plane, is flown to a place in the middle of the desert, brought into a building in the middle of the desert where a bunch of strange objects were in like an industrial laboratory. I told it, figure out how they work. A couple years later, he asked the same professor, the professor denied that and said, no, it was Russian objects. So that's a really interesting story. That's the best one I'm talking about. Well, yeah, because he asked, he said, what were they? And he said, they're not ours. Yeah, he said, they're not ours. Quote, they're not ours. Yeah. And then later on, he's like, Oh, I didn't mean any Chai or anything when it was Russian. Yeah. So, but he didn't believe that. No, you don't believe that because why would a PhD in electrical engineering know that? So that's an interesting story. Three, three D monster. No, sir, I actually have my degree in mechanical engineering. Oh, okay. Sorry about that, guys. Still working on this. In documentaries or hearings, hearings, I would hope so. I know he's, he's willing to kind of testify of approach documentaries. I'm not quite sure he's, he's kind of like, he doesn't want to do too many media appearances. One of the reasons he did this interview is just because like, you know, we've developed a relationship with Michael over the months, but do you have any other insights? I mean, there's some stuff that I'm vaguely aware of, but I don't, I don't think it's like public yet. But, you know, one thing I want to just kind of acknowledge as well. I spoke to Ross Colthart, like last year, very early on, he was actually one of the first people I approached to kind of share the evidence that I had. And he finally, you know, he did a Reddit AMA a few months ago, and acknowledge that he's investigating Michael Herrera's case. And I've known this the whole time. And he also recently in one of his reality check segments, you know, expressed that he finds what he says he likes Michael, and he finds what he says credible. So I just want to like, put that out there, you know, in case you guys missed it. This is a very interesting case. And I mean, at this point, like, there are a lot of things that I know Michael is 100% telling the truth about. And, you know, of course, there's a lot of things that I don't have the evidence for. Yeah, plenty. Yeah, like, people call real fast broke Johnny like, where can I find this custodian filing? Thank you so much. Love you, man. A lot of people call have called Joey Michael's publicist. But, you know, you don't you do not claim to have all the all the information with Michael, do you? No, and it's like, you know, there's a lot of times like he in the past, like he's done interviews. Like, I didn't even know he was doing an interview. And like, I just see it just like all you guys, you know. But, you know, I did reach out to, like I said, Ross, and Richard Dolan, and, you know, like Chris Leto yourself. Yeah, you know, I reach out to you, Steven Deener, because, you know, I knew that they were interested in talking to Michael. And I was like, Hey, can I just like, you mind if I can talk to them ahead of time? And Michael put me in touch with them sometimes or sometimes I'd reach out directly. And I just be like, look, I'd have a private video call with them and just be like, look, I just want to share this evidence that I have before you talk to Michael so you can see. But I'm not like at all part of like, court meeting, his appearances or anything like that. So, yeah, people, for a long time, people thought I was Michael, because like I was anonymous. Yeah, but now everybody knows you Joey, this dude's a giant man. He's like, six, five, six, four, he dwarfs me. He dwarfs Michael. But I'm not like built like you. You're, you're like Jack. Yes, this is, this is Joey right here. Chris Leto. I think he's gotten such things. Chris Leto is a wonderful man, a good pilot, a fantastic channel. There was of course a period of time where, you know, the don't die, don't die. He's all dude, he's a giant. But there was just a period of time. Do you think NASA and Space Force knows? Space Force, I'm not quite sure. NASA, NASA's had a weird relationship with, with UAP. If you, if you remember my last video, that kind of NASA back in the 60s and 70s would always claim they had no kind of interest in studying UAP. But there was a good period of time in 70s, specifically 78 where there were many internal memos with NASA discussing UAP. So I'm not sure to their extent, like if NASA is involved in black programs and reverse engineering, but NASA is very, very interesting. Thoughts on Raytheon building UFOs and Antarctica. I've heard nothing about this, Polaris. If you have anything to share, email me at gmail.com. I'd love to see what you say. So we'll try to get out of these questions. Get to Patrick's. Okay. Is this, do you think Nathan was put? No, no. He so yeah. So I got in touch with Nathan pretty early on. And he was extremely gracious with his time, you know, going back and forth with me, you know, just kind of texting and chatting. And, you know, quickly found out he is exactly what he says he is. I do not at all think he's like a paid disinformation agent or anything like that. What I kind of got the vibe was he just never liked Michael. And I got that vibe from every political member I spoke to, because you have to understand Michael was not part of their group through boot camp, you know, he was in a different company. He went UA, which is unauthorized absence from his original company. He's upfront about that from his very first, you know, coming forward. Yeah. So, you know, it was nothing he ever was hiding behind. And, you know, people accused him of like trying to hide that. But so he got transferred to Nathan's company prior to that deployment to Indonesia. And so all of those guys looked at him and they just think he's like a loser because, you know, they find out he went UA and, you know, they were bullying him and he just kind of leaned into it and kind of screwed with them back. And so none of them liked it. So that's what I recognize for Nathan. And I mean, if you can put yourself in Nathan's shoes and, you know, the guy that you remember being strange is coming forward with like his really extraordinary claims. And he was his team leader, you know, at, you know, during that deployment. But, you know, I, so like, I don't have a military background. So like, I, the, you know, if Michael has said from, from his first, you know, testimony that the mission he was on was a volunteer pick of people from different squads. And I think he even said different platoons because there are multiple platoons on the ship. And so from day one, his testimony has always been that he did not deploy with his assigned squad. So Nathan was never a part of Michael's testimony. And it's just kind of silly that like why would Michael, like if Michael was making this up, why would he make up a fake mission about a UFO? But then after, you know, 14 years of thinking about it and saying, I'm going to come forward, also decide to lie about the real mission he did with Nathan. That part has always bothered me. It just makes no sense. Because literally the only thing that puts Nathan's testimony against Michael is Michael's denial of him going on a mission with him. So he could have easily just said, yeah, I did two missions. I did one with a volunteer group that, you know, saw the UAP. And then I did another regular mission with my team leader. And we didn't see anything on that one. So I'm not sure if there was a second part to that question. We'll explore through a couple of these. We'll be Milo. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. If you've got any questions, I will get to them right away. Sorry, we're trying to scroll through these questions. And I see you anonymous. What do you mean? Let us let us know what you think. Why are you staying in a trust we grow with million claims? No evidence, because I understand how you feel. Like here, how you think, why is that that some things are made not made public yet? I like to think back to David Rush saying a program for reverse engineering and so forth, feudalistic dominance. And just I still think that over time, there's a lot more interesting parallels to be drawn to somewhat of a hidden cold war for decades between adversaries and so forth, kind of a race to understand this technology thoughts on Kirk Patrick's new position. DOE influence all the time. I do not like Kirk Patrick at all. And I think his interview with Green Street was pretty funny how part two was just kind of changed to be solely discussing the 2018 Skinwalker Braving. So with the Raytheon stuff, I don't know. I don't know what I think about Eric Hecker. Some of his claims, I know I'm talking about Michael here and discussing how I find his claims interesting. The neutrino detector, that's a little bit hard to believe that the neutrino detector is like a kind of like a weather weapon. I need I need to do more study than to like have a and just to touch on the why things aren't public yet. I mean, the group that Michael is working with, with this insider, their pro disclosure, like this was the whole reason they connected with Michael. They have things going on that they're trying to, you know, I think if you guys back out and kind of look at disclosure as a whole, like there's multiple groups of people trying to push disclosure forward from different angles. You know, you've got the legislation side of things. You have kind of, you know, intelligence community insiders who weren't read into the program, but kind of have an idea that there's something going on and they're kind of pushing things forward to try to get things. And you have people in the program who just can't become public about it because they have, you know, families and they're at risk. And I think what we're hearing not just from Michael, but from other sources is that there needs to be more kind of whistleblower protection. Yeah. Something I experienced outright with TB in it, this is kind of aligns with the whistleblower protection is part of the reason I don't think he wanted to come forward with career is, you know, having his name public, he will still lose his pension completely. You guys got a family to provide for and so forth, but his pension will be completely gone, never get another job in government. So more whistleblower protection seem to be in place and kind of liquid how some whistleblowers have been treated a little bit. Do you think the next aero boss, do you think the next aero boss will be different? Probably not. I think aero is rotten from the inside out then, but I'd love to be proven wrong. I think there needs to be a large internal investigation into aero. Let's see what, thank you so much Broke Johnny Live. That's your second cash donation. I really appreciate you. We do not need any person to film these in 4K. Yeah, footage is a weird one to me because as we saw on vetted yesterday, there was that dude at Moopon who presented that crash retrieval photo. And it's just like, footage is a little, is really hard to kind of authenticate or completely disprove. And at this point for me, like in my private research, just studying footage is not enough. That's why I try and talk to all these people. I really just want to speak to people and so forth. I'm not, thank you for your channel. Thank you so much first, last, I appreciate you. I want to talk to Anonymous. Yeah, I definitely understand that point of view because there's a lot of trust me bro stuff with people like Jeremy Corbell. I think with this evidence where Michael was taken, I think that Joey can't share it because Michael- Well, it would just compromise the insider. Totally compromise. But like, I totally understand the sentiment and like, I just, I had a decision. Do I just not say anything publicly, even though I know it's true? Or what I came up with was a compromise. I said, well, let me reach out to different people who, you know, the community mostly trusts, you know, different kind of people in the community, podcasters, journalists and things like that and share that evidence with them. And then they can, you know, if they think I'm full of baloney, they can call me out on it and shut me down, you know. What I didn't expect was a lot of them kind of wanted to kind of continue their investigation privately and not just like come forward and stuff like that. But at the end of the day, I totally respect and understand the majority of you guys feeling like, you know, this, you just kind of want to set this aside because that evidence isn't- That's a good question to touch on too. Very good question. Why would it compromise the insider? Because this, you know, these guys have kind of a regular job as well, right? They're like, it's not just like the Black program stuff that they do, they have kind of a regular job that they do. And so the location would kind of indicate the people that work there, essentially, you know. So that's why. Well, there's another reason. So you're working. It's having positive vibes. Thank you, brother. Not to trust me, bro. Anon, I totally understand your sentiment, man. Like, I would love for Michael to talk about this. I'd love for this thing insider to be public, but unfortunately, I don't get to call the shots there. I'm just trying to kind of study this case as best as I can. But, you know, I completely understand why it's frustrating, especially in a subject where a lot of people make claims and don't really touch on it. Aztec. Aztec's a really good case I really want to cover. So if you guys remember to, if you guys remember when I did my Wilson Davis memo, James, the guy who actually beat the Wilson Davis memo, I become friends with him. He's a wonderful man, a great person, and he is strongly of the mind that Aztec is a hoax. So I really want to speak to him and why he does that. Majed Brazil, I really want to cover that too. MacMade Studios has a terrific kind of a, have you seen that? It's a blender. It's like a recreation of a grass retreat event. MacMade Studios. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's super good. It's awesome. Yeah, it is really good. But yeah, I wish more people would be public, man. Have you verified the guy that- Yes, this is the second part of your question, Patrick, that I still talk. You know, I don't want to, I don't want to go too far into this because I don't, yeah, I don't know how much everyone's comfortable. So to a certain extent, I'll say that I have verified the person who sent the text, kind of claiming that, so the context is Michael sent a, actually called, actually this is good to explain because people don't know the context. So Michael called one of the five Marines who witnessed this event with him to see if they'd be willing to kind of come forward with him and, you know, be public. And he left a message and the guy replied later, I think it was several days later, with the text message. And that's why, so like I posted the text message. I had seen the message like months and months prior and I talked to Michael about it. I was like, hey, do you think I can post the actual screenshot of the message? And I censored out like the messages above and people were like, why did, you know, we want to see what was asked and all that. The reason why it was censored is the text messages involved were from like weeks prior, months prior. Michael had called him, left the message, but then this person responded via text. So hopefully that kind of explains it a little bit more. But yeah, I'll just leave it there for now because, you know, like Michael says, like none of the guys that he witnessed this with want anything to do with this, you know, like you've got to remember like they all signed NDAs threatening their lives and jail time and all of that. And Michael kind of, you know, violated that NDA by coming forward. So I don't want to do anything at all to, you know, kind of make them upset. And it's just something I'm kind of setting aside for now. Any noticeable or notable case in Louisiana probably closest, I know, is Cape to Rodeau 1941. And that's a really interesting case. Let's try to get some of these thoughts on Brandon Fugle and Travis Taylor. I don't have many thoughts or opinions on Brandon Fugle, to be honest. I do think it's kind of weird. He never followed up with a green street about the about the Shunker Patrick thing. But I don't have many thoughts or Travis Taylor is the dude on Skinwalker Ranch, right? Travis Taylor, yeah. I don't know. I've never watched Skinwalker Ranch. Any TV show, whether it's Ghost Hunters or any reality show. I mean, he's had other because he has a PhD then. Yeah, he's been involved with UAT. Tell us now, there's plans are strange. Joel says we are too. I'm really interested in Tums lately. An interesting kind of piece on that. I don't think it's in print anymore as UFO highway book. If you get in contact with me, I'll send that to you because it's really interesting. I don't want to be very confused about the Nazca bodies. There's a website on this, I want you to check out. Let me pull that up. Sorry, let me pull this up. If you're watching, if you're interested in the bodies, it's called Crap. It's called alien-alien-project.com and you can look at the 3D scans of all the bodies and that's just a really cool thing to look at. I don't really have an opinion on them right now because I haven't studied too much, but it's very strange. Ryan Roberts, 5K, USD announced who it is. I don't know who it is and so I cannot do that. Well, where do you think the huge unmovable object that UFO Ross says, I have heard rumors that this is Pine Gap Australia and I think that that's probably like a pretty interesting place. I know TV said Seoul, South Korea and I know there was a pretty good Reddit investigation in South Korea, but I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate. Recommendations, I don't really dig into this. Yes, dude, just read into tons of documents. That's all I can say. The way I started this was I'm just a normal dude. I'm kind of an idiot. I like to get punched in the face for fun. I just read a lot. Speaking of jujitsu. Yeah, I try and catalog everything I can do. My drink and sauce by the bottle, I do not. Soy sauce. This is kombucha. It's really good, by the way. Yes, sir, I would love to. Can we get you cloned, dude? No, I'm not giving you my DNA. That'd be weird. It'd probably be pretty annoying to hang out with the clone of me. I'm sorry, guys. I'm trying to look through. Yeah, Xavier, that good shout on Travis Taylor. Yeah, I thought UAP Task Force, he was on UAP Task Force. Yeah, I completely agree with that. That's something that TV commented on in his emails. Specifically, University Affiliated Research Centers. I still need to do some digging there, but I think that there's some interesting things there. Taylor was also on UAP-TF. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mention that, guys. Thanks, both of you, for bringing that up. I like, of course, not something that's pretty interesting, but there's, of course, some controversy there. I like Monop AFD. I like nuclear-based incursion. One of my favorite stories is Bob Jacobs. Of course, that's a dummy warhead, but you're familiar with Bob Jacobs, right? I love that story. Jesus, all this. Okay, come on, man. Anyone bring up those new move-on photos? Yeah, we kind of touched on a little bit. The photos are interesting, of course, but I don't know what to say. It's just a photo, and I think the dude on the live just wanted to flash it up for a second and bring it down. I don't know. It's a weird photo. I can't really say anything more than a strange photo. Yeah, this is really interesting. Blue, Elizondo, and Steven G. Bean are odds with each other. Gray said that a few thousand four-in-init tic-tacs are man-made ARBs and calls Lou a disinformation agent. Lou has basically called Gray a fraud. So the whole thing with Green Street and Lou, I think you guys will probably think is super interesting. I find that super interesting. There is a strange absence of documents around Lou, and they tip, but I think Lou is a fantastic person, but he seems like he wants disclosure, and I'm actually kind of excited for his book. Yeah, you're going to look good. Okay, hey, this is a good point, man. So what we kind of talked about earlier, when I brought up the 1974 Chihuahua incident, this is in Kaio-Mei, the same region where sploxide occurs. So we're talking about the Sentinels of Atheropoeia. Yeah, Sentinels of Atheropoeia 2004, JSA. The insider is kind of having produced and is going through the officer review right now. So it takes place in this. So I have a little conspiracy theory that I'm trying to look through that this 1974 Kaio-Mei case with the American operators taking down the Mexican military retrieval team is the case referenced in Sentinels of Atheropoeia. I need to keep looking at that, but that's something I need to keep going through. Has my course to you? Yeah, he's talked about this kind of a lot in terms of, he said his father has been threatened, and he says he's seen curious kind of flyovers of helicopters almost circling strafing his place of work and so forth. You want to touch on that before I get to this next question? Oh, no, that's all right. All right, contact, arrival, or interstellar. That's a tough question, man, but I got to go with interstellar. Time and no time for caution, or no time for caution is one of the best film songs of all time. You've seen interstellar. Yeah, I would say interstellar too. Yeah, the scores. Interstellar is a fan. All of these are great movies, especially contact. That's severely underrated with Joni Foster. You've seen that, right? I don't think I have actually, man. You got to see it. Yeah. That's any idea why JSOC is coming up in here. Yes, because if this insider is telling the truth, and he's not just a disinfo guy, and he's trying to disseminate information through Sentinels of Ether, there's a reason why he's bringing up JSOC. I just don't understand the Sentinels of Ether. No, the disinfo angle with Michael. I also don't get the... Like, what's the logic, guys? Like, tell me what the logic is. Like, Michael came forward, most people didn't believe him, and so why would there be a... Like, what's the agenda? I don't get it. You know, like, I just don't understand. And I mean, at this point, I'm like so confident that this guy is who he says he is for a variety of reasons. I mean, I don't have, like, definitive proof, because that would be me going through that black side and seeing it for myself. And obviously, I didn't do that. So, like, I'm like a couple steps removed from that, I guess. And Django. That's love, man. And that's a really cute... Do you see that? Oh, my God. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. If not... If non-disclosure, if non-human intelligence exists, do you think government wouldn't officially say, no, I don't? I don't know how many elements in government officially know this. I'd like to look back to the early 1950s. This is something I just talked about in the infographics video, too, within Truman and Eisenhower, and kind of the heavy possibility of U.S. government elements losing track of the UAP situation at that time. If we look back to the 40s and 50s, you have scientists like Herman Auberth and so forth who you're talking and actually making flight measurements and estimates of UAP flight characteristics. So, back at this time, it was pretty well thought out to be non-human intelligence and flying saucers and so forth. So, I don't think this is going to be done by the people. By the people, hopefully, and I hope this, people in programs that Grush has talked about, some of his 40 witnesses, these people need to start to test apart. Yeah. It's kind of an annoying bit of silence. What do you think of Charles Hall? That name sounds familiar, but I can't remember. Do you know Charles Hall? So, Julian Grocks, if you can tell me, best favorite UFO photo, my profile picture, 2006 or 2007, Wisconsin, there's a series of two of them. I love this image. I look at it just something that kind of makes me feel a little scared inside. What do you say? I don't really have a favorite, but I can respect why you feel like that's really compelling. It's a great series of images that I'll provide on my community notes. There's a good kind of story in the summary of the people who took the photos and so forth, and there's two cases of it. Really interesting. Would you like to hear your research on value authority? Somebody was talking about Valiant Thor in the Twitter space the other day. That's when I messaged you and I said, these guys are talking about value authority. Oh, that's right. Yeah. I first heard about that. I think it was Jason Sands. It was Sands? Yeah, he was on a live. He was on an X space, rather. Okay, Valiant Thor, for any of you who don't know, Valiant Thor is like a supposed Venusian extraterrestrial that came down in the, I think Eisenhower administration and basically worked in the Pentagon. I first heard about this on a podcast called Mysterious Universe. It's a really good podcast. It's a little tongue-in-cheeked, a little silly. If any of you guys have heard that, I absolutely love that podcast. But that story is a bit, I mean, I have no confirming evidence or things to disprove the story, but I find it a little strange that basically an uncanny valley type human is working in the Pentagon, but I don't know. I don't have anything to, I don't have anything to debunk that story, but I do find it a little strange. Let's keep seeing. I do agree with what DeLaunch had on Steve's pot about Valiant Thor. I don't know what he said, so if you know what he said, please let me know. Ross Holt Hart said it is a psionic. Yeah, so the psionic in the, I think that was in the AMA, you know, like what's one word everyone should be looking into to kind of push things forward or learn more about what's going on. He said psionic. And from my perspective, that is a 100% direct reference to Michael's testimony, you know, relaying information from the insider. Okay, that's my opinion. And I'll just repeat that Ross is actively investigating Michael's case and finds it incredible. I'll say that I have not talked to Ross, especially about Michael. So like, I can't add anything there. I would love to speak to Ross, but no, like, I know you've talked to Ross, but I have not. Yeah, I've not spoken to Ross. So I mean, I could be wrong, but like that word for me, the first, I never heard psionic until Michael brought it up. And that was like a big part of, you know, the whole, the whole thing with, I think I first heard about like psionic stuff back in like 20, I can't remember the 2020s when those supposed A tip slides leaked from Chris Mellon's personal website. I think it's slide nine, which talks like what's considered like the phenomenon is not considered quantum physics and talk about kind of a consciousness affecting of being approximately the UAP and so forth. So that is super, super interesting. I don't know because, you know, I'm not a psychic. If I was, I'd make better YouTube videos, but I'm not a psychic. I don't know anybody not psychic. So that of course is one of the toughest things for me to wrap my head around. What soft disclosure points? I don't know because you have close encounters of the third kind and you have a really weird, you have a lot of parallels to real life, like that eccentric French scientist who is basically a movie analog analog to a Jacques Valais and the J. Allen, Heineck type scientists. So I don't know, but that I'd be interested to find out. I agree. Jay Sock was also mentioned in the article exposing the OGA. Yes, the OGA is something I'm trying to invent investigate right now as we speak. I think that's so interesting. There's a couple guys I'm talking to that have some poignant points on OGA and my car wolf, the former head and so forth. So that'd be interesting. All right. What does this say? So David Gruss has confirmed that deep state is real thoughts on the legitimacy of the USA government. Democracy is fake. I definitely think there is a program that studies reverse engineering. We're like looking around the camera questions to see the questions. At least from everything I've studied, I'd like to support the thesis that there is evidence that there is a crash retrieval in reverse engineering project that is not necessarily run by USG elements with oversight. Yeah. I mean, this stuff, this stuff's so crazy, guys. Like I totally understand that. I mean, it's, it's, I don't know. It's, I really don't know. It's just recalculation. Wait, but the text message from his bussy who tells him he isn't too deep. I think your comments more common. Okay, let's keep going through. I don't know if I consider her at this info, but the play devil's advocate would definitely be value in elevating false whistleblowers to discredit people indirectly the whole prospect. Yeah, totally agree. And I didn't think at the 2023, there's some kind of a little bit of false whistleblowers and so forth. Well, one, one thing I don't understand, like people kind of call this a Dodie Benowitz situation. And the thing I don't understand about that at all is, you know, Benowitz didn't have the same type of experience that Herrera did. Benowitz intercepted communications, if I'm correct. Yeah, I think it was near Mallory. No, no, that's Kenneth Arnold near a kind of like a plateau. He thought he was intercepting like communication between NHI and so Dodie came in and like supported that idea and like egged it on. This is like the opposite. Like Michael saw anti gravity craft. It flew off. There's like no mistaking what his testimony is from his perspective. So it makes no sense if Michael was making this up. How could an insider come in and like egg him on about it being like, Oh, yeah, I saw the operation you came, you stumbled upon. If Michael knows he's making it up, you would know the insider is lying to him about, you know, knowing what operation he stumbled upon. So I just, I just don't even see the logic of how that would work. So I kind of find that that comparison a little silly. Yeah, I need to let's let's scroll keep going through. Sorry, we're trying to get through all these whack-a-mechs. Much love, brother. Thank you. What do you think about the idea of agreements with NHI? It's really interesting. David Gresh has commented on that as pretty much fact. One of the things that I remember is I think it's 1954, Holloman Air Force based landing with Eisenhower coming down to contact extra terrestrials and making some agreement with them. There's stories that this is to allow extra terrestrials to do abductions and so forth. And Greer has some interesting whistleblowers in his log that talked about observing like the 54 Holloman landing, what these agreements could be, why these agreements are with people that live in this continent and not others, or if Russia is going to come out and say that Russia, China has their own agreements. I don't know. I find it really interesting, but I struggle a lot to find out, to think what those agreements could be. Why would an NHI, why would a NHI species need to make agreements with humans? Yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of speculation. I really don't know. Yeah, speculation. And there's some pretty interesting stories around there, but I really hope we can get to the bottom of that or hear more from Gresh because I don't know. I mean, he alluded to it. No, no, no. He said in a Ross Bullard interview in the first one, the News Nation one, Ross says something like an agreement has been made with NHI and Gresh says, yeah. So I don't know. Wait, is that the Joey? Yes, this is the Joey, man. This is Joey. It's not my name. I mean, my name's not Joey, but I am Joey. It's not my name. Quitter. Yeah, I struggle with this every day. The abduction, psionic ET communication is the hardest part for me to wrap my head around. Yeah, and honestly, guys, I seriously think I've got this cognitive dissonance sometimes when I'm investigating this case, and I focus in on the tangible stuff that, you know, is in my kind of reality of what the real world is like. And so I focus on the military stuff, the operation and things like that. And I kind of like take a bigger, crazy picture of what Michael's claiming and just set it aside. Because like, it's such a wild change for like how I understand what works, that it's hard for me to really accept it. Yeah, it's something like I'm actively studying to learn more about. But, you know, for somebody with an engineering background who's really interested in craft, pressure, trivose, more so tangible stuff, it's really difficult for me to understand, especially because, you know, I've had no like personal experiences with any sort of psychicness. Laxative pain is out of play on Max pain. Thank you so much. Just dropping the Max pain right in there. Oh, hey, that was a good game. Max pain three is going on. I played the OG Max pain for those kind of slow and the activist GTA. I'll check that out tonight, man. Fose 1997. I really appreciate you brother. Thoughts on Ashton and the NH three 70 videos. I don't know much. I try to stay out of that because that seems like a really big kind of a rabbit hole. I have heard many people say that those are debunked, but I really don't know, man. I try to say out of that. I remember when that video was released, I was like, holy crap, that's really cool. I really don't know much to be honest. What about you? Yeah, I mean, it's, it seems pretty compelling that they're hoaxed. However, and I don't really like Ashton's reaction to a lot of really logical kind of presentations like the raw the raw photos finding the original photographer took the raw photos of the clouds and the sequence and he's kind of, you know, comebacks to those are relatively weak and kind of emotional reactions. However, there are certain things that I find interesting about the context of the way the videos were put together, I guess, and it makes me almost wonder if maybe they are hoaxed, but maybe they're hoaxed by a high level government not just a senior person, not just like a random dude like in his basement, but like maybe this was a kind of official like project to put this out for some sort of reason because there's there's things about the satellite, like the specific satellite that was, you know, supposedly taking images that like how would the person know this within the timeframe and just like the alignment of a lot of different things. And so there's a lot of, I haven't gone too deep into it, I've really just focused on Herrera's case, but and I don't like how Ashton is handling a lot of the criticisms and stuff, but there's still like a little piece there that I do find interesting. Matt Ford announced that maybe the OGA has changed recently. Yeah, I remember when that Daily Mail article about the OGA came out too, there seemed to be a lot of kind of changes from the internet archive on kind of the flow of information from how to access the OGA. The OGA is super interesting. Sorry, just trying to scroll through some of the questions. Should I still report it to move on? Edward, tell me, man. Send me an email. I want to hear about it. You might be good about gmail.com, gata scamming. I want to hear about your experience, man. That sounds incredible. This is a great question. What are your opinions on, I think that was a really bad idea for you to come down with on Twitter. Yeah, unfortunately, and I think part of the thing that I think Mr. Sands made as a kind of mistake was going too much into being too generous with providing his speculative thoughts on different questions that were totally unrelated to his direct experience of what his encounter and his job. Because what happens is now people get that sound bite and they think he's speaking that from a firsthand perspective and it just kind of muddies the water. One thing that's interesting that I think we can talk about regarding Sands, so we actually had another meeting yesterday with Michael and another individual who was kind of behind the scenes. He's someone in the intelligence community, someone I've been speaking to for a while, and he kind of vouched for the fact that Jason Sands was participating in the UAP Task Force Forum. So there was some, you know, that you guys probably remember that argument about, you know, Sands said he was part of the UAP Task Force and but then he's like, well, I mean the forum and people kind of flipped out about that. But from what this IC person that we saw yesterday kind of explained to us was like, that's kind of how it was. There was like the UAP Task Force Forum was kind of this, it's essentially like a collaborative platform that's behind, you know, a top secret clearance, but it's accessible to a wide range of intelligence community individuals. And so what was happening was people who were officially part of the UAP Task Force might reach out to someone in the NGA or something and be like, oh, have you guys seen this or that? And like, you know, people who had a personal interest in UAP could just jump in there and kind of like be like, on the side, like do a little bit of research and like, you know, give it to the task force. And so it was kind of, you know, the way I kind of understand it is like, you kind of felt like you were part of the UAP Task Force if you were just part of that group. It's kind of like if you're on like a discord chat, you would say like, oh yeah, I'm part of that group. Yeah. You know, if you're, you know, so the way, yeah, the way we heard is you participated in kind of this forum, so forth, kind of contributed to the UAP Task Force. And that's when he told the story. And kind of a lot of really interesting people kind of find Sam's credible or think he's just a fantastic person. They have wonderful things to say. Yeah. I mean, like his character alone, I've only heard very positive things about his character. So I think, I think it's just kind of the way he decided to come forward, just had him come forward on wrong foot. And yeah. And again, like for me personally, I feel like it's important for whistleblowers, especially when they first come forward, stick to your direct experiences, let people know what you're speculating. Yeah. Or just be like, you know, I don't want to go there. Like just to cement in people's minds, like this is their direct experience. Sorry, you're trying to like hammer through all these questions. And I'm not going to be standing on. That's kind of, that's what we did with our Michael. How much from, what time do you want to go to? Okay, we'll go to 5.20. So eight minutes, guys, then we got to hop off, right? Yeah. So we'll do just a question of them. But for an interview with Michael, we try to make sure that, that every time he was speculating about something, he made it clear, just because we want to kind of hammer down his case from his words. So let's keep, let's get through these. We'll stay on for a little bit more. Trollmama, thank you so much. And I like that little beaver, beaver running through. I really appreciate you. Above Black by Dan Sherman, I was told to read this yesterday. So I'm going to be reading that and kind of, I'll check it and let you know what I think. I think that's my next read. Please look into Jason Thans a little deeper. Yes. I'm currently trying to get in contact with Sans to speak to him. I really want to talk to him. I think this was a response to the question on the guy saying he was playing devil's advocate about Michael and the fake purposeful disinformation. I don't think necessarily an example of elevated pulse was born. Yeah, suspicious about Jason Sans, especially with how he came forward, right? Like this dude pops up on a Twitter space. And especially when he kind of has an idea and runs with it. So, you know, I really wish our first introduction with him was the James Fox, James Fox interview. Yeah, or like just some other interview thoughts on Wagan. Wagan's awesome. Although he won't try to talk to him. I don't think he wants to do more interviews. I've tried to contact him on massive, multiple platforms. Sorry. You can't discredit the legitimate witnesses and whistleblowers coming down the pipe. You can preemptively discredit the idea of a UFO whistleblower. If you're talking about Sans there, I'm not shutting down Sans. I kind of need to talk to him personally before I can form a full opinion, just because of how strange his coming out was on Twitter and so forth. There's a lot of messiness there and a lot of murky waters. Because I know there's been a lot of discussion around him and so forth. Is there any evidence at all for abductions being real? I don't know. We were talking about the Travis Walton case today and neither of us really know what to think about that. I don't know. I try and stay a little away from abductions a little bit, because I know it's pretty murky. Why assuming NHI is a biological life form, why would anything more powerful than us? I don't know. It's an interesting question. Especially so many hypotheses as to why NHI are here and interacting or not interacting with us is new hypothesis for one. That's a great question. It looks like anonymous is leaving us gang. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry I disappointed you, dude. Without disclosing names or locations, can Joey explain? Yeah, you talked about that earlier, right? Yeah. It started from a piece of evidence that I was able to corroborate it with multiple public sources, data sources. At this point, I've said I've tracked the helicopter. I was able to figure out the exact helicopter that he was on. He flew to this location. Naturally, anyone, if you know a specific aircraft, you can go and look on flight radar and see where it went at a certain time. That was my initial thing that was like, holy crap. Even after that, I have, now at this point, it's just, there's no doubt whatsoever. My issue with Greer, yeah, I completely agree with that. He tried, what I've noticed and possibly heard is that when he has a witness, he tries to claim the mess as his own so he can be the central figure and central point of contact for everything. Trollmama, I think there's plenty of people investigating. There's a lot of, there's a lot of really good channels on YouTube, a lot of great people. My butthole is your butthole, Ashton. What the heck? You didn't hear about that one? No. We don't need to go into it. It was his little logic witness test talking about the effects effect that was on. How does that have to do with investigating? Because he thinks all explosions have the same pattern. He's like, you have a butthole, I have a butthole, but my butthole's not your butthole. It was just so cringey. If you want people to take this seriously, why would technology so overheads? Yeah, I'd like to think back to the, if we were to give a smartphone to the ancient Romans or a nuclear bomb to people in the Victorian era. Interesting question. I believe, I believe, so it looks like a lot of people are kind of commenting or talking about psionics. A lot of people are kind of open to this idea, reading more, paying attention more. That's something that I need to educate myself more on. Yeah, there was actually a couple of people that asked this elsewhere, but Michael had alluded to last year, actually, he was going to be kind of going out and meeting the insider again and seeing like a demonstration of one of these psionics, attracting, calling a craft or something like that. That kind of, that was supposed to happen last year. That fell through. Things are kind of up in the air about that right now. It makes sense. I understand why I can't, I can't really talk about why, but at this point, I honestly don't even think that would be even something that, because I was kind of nervous about it to begin with, because like what, you know, even if you could like videotape that or something, is it just going to be three, is it just going to be three lights in the sky? Yeah. And I was kind of like, I don't know if that's even going to be a good thing to do. And so there's other things that are kind of trying to be put together in the background that I think are going to be a better path forward to help support disclosure. I'll say that much. Let's keep going. So that might still happen. It's just the, I don't know when. Thank you, brother. I appreciate the help. Samuel, forget that's a cool profile, I've not read Trinity. I've heard a little bit of a D. Dean Johnson kind of trying to discredit that case because I know Jacques Malay has worked on it. So I've kind of worked on that case, but I need to educate myself a little more on that. And I would like to read Trinity and I would like to read what a D&amp;D Johnson says. Gary Nolan worked on a project for CIA, someone we trust. I don't know. Gary Nolan seems to be a, I know nothing like a negative or anything about Gary Nolan seems like an interesting do kind of pushing for disclosure. I hope his head's in the right place. Yeah, I haven't heard about that either. But okay, bro, say this is legit. If you listen to his interview, he's very reserved and is free to speak more. Yes, that's why I want to talk to him because there's so much kind of drama and controversy around him online and kind of social media spaces. But I want to talk to him and hear his story from his words. But he still said 20 back. Yeah, I remember it like, back in like 2016 or so, I heard the first, that first dude, he said the 20 and back thing was a thing to go work at, like they're mining on the moon with reptilians. That requires some extraordinary proof for that. So that is, that is something a bit strange. All right, let's get through these and then we'll start wrapping up eminent domain. I don't think that eminent domain will ever happen. There's also other people we've talked to, not like whistleblowers or anything, just guys with interesting backgrounds that also don't think that happened. Private aerospace have legal rights to exploit technology despite potential legal technology transfers. Yeah, I think probably what David brush says is pretty interesting has a lot through it that a lot of technology is specifically craft is stored in private domain to avoid any sort of kind of eminent domain grab or any sort of access to this craft keeps things off books and projects and so forth. You have anything to add? Go ahead. Okay, sorry, I just joined. Was it Joey supposed to be anonymous? Yes, he was, but this is Joey. Well, it's like, I was never like, supposedly, it's like, if you do you have a Reddit account? Are you anonymous on Reddit? Yeah, me too. So like, I got into this whole thing and I was just like, that just kind of maintained. And then it got to a point where everyone was like, why are you anonymous? And it's like, well, I don't know. And, and, you know, things were getting, I didn't know how much dangerous put myself in. And I think at this point, the kind of secret stuff that I knew that I was kind of nervous about having and wanted to remain anonymous about Michael has has talked about now. So I feel a lot more comfortable kind of at least show my face. And so I decided to do that. So because I feel like the longer I kind of remain completely in the shadows, like the worst that's going to get in. So it really wasn't a big deal to begin with. And so that's just why. All right, let's get through these. Hey, what's up, Dutch in case that is a super interesting case. I think I did that in the first ever iceberg video. Betty and Barney Hills granddaughter is a UFC fighter, Angela Hill. She talked about that on JRE once. That was pretty interesting. I like that case. That's a really interesting thing. Monster Hunter. Love you. For me, Travis Walton and the passing goal, sorry, you guys know I can't pronounce anything. Our plenty evidence that NHI abductions are in a real phenomenon. The thing with me is I kind of sit me to sit down and do like a full investigation for myself to reach any sort of conclusion. Like I like to sit through, read multiple books, kind of way, way things and really sit down and abductions is one thing I really haven't given a ton of time or focus to. What about you? Yeah, I mean, guys, I'm not like I'm not Gerb Gerbs, like researching like all these different cases and stuff. Like I, I'm just like a normal dude. I was like a regular, like some random Redditor guy and like a rare case, just somehow I got wrapped up into it. And that's kind of what I've been focusing on. And, you know, so I'd love to sometime in the future, like make a website with all my documents as a repository because I have so dang many. And, you know, like in all the, the show and all the times put the documents and stuff I'd lead to, but I'd love like a central database of everything there. Yeah, Forgotten Language is a super interesting. I first read that in the anonymous briefing document for, for Congress in 2023. The Forgotten Language thing is, is sweet. There's this really cool group of people, some great people that did a deep dive into Forgotten Languages. I need to kind of get educated from them. Are you going back to the 1933 case I'd like to after those recent release of RS33 documents? Big on the crypto terrestrial hypothesis, that's super interesting too. I'd like to visit back. Trinity case is weak. You know, I need to study that as well. Let's, I hear you, not Joey yet, not Joey. Sorry, but who was sued a broke brother? If you've seen it in my videos, I'm Gert. This is Joey. Joey's not my name on Reddit. I'm sorry, man. I'm Gert. Okay, let's see. Can't wait for the Obama movie. Yeah, that's weird. The Obama movie about the hill. Yeah, but he's learning hill. Yeah. Harry. Hey, look at that dog. That's a very cute dog. True nuts and bolts. I don't know. I got to study anything else. And Harry, thank you so much for, for both of this. I'd like to say as, as kind of like a, but this is a great point. If abductions are other logical, if we visit another planet, we would sample the floor and on absolutely, absolutely. That's why it's not something to just throw away, but needs to be kind of investigated. I would like to say for this live, you know, we didn't really know what to expect. We just kind of wanted to talk about Michael and so forth. And you guys came with so many awesome questions. Like this was actually really fun. So, you know, if, if you guys would like to see, to do some more lives or see some like that, I would you want to do some more? Maybe a live or you know, so it's like, all right, I have a ton of respect for what you do. I, I have been so apprehensive about like becoming a content creator because it's like, you, you're very vulnerable because, you know, if you talk about or investigate a case that you like, and you put some credibility into it, then like later it turns out to be a complete lie on the line. It's kind of like, that's now attached to you. And I'm like, so afraid to do that. And, and, and like this community can can be very toxic. But like, I got to say, like your, your followers are so great. I think they recognize like the amount of work you put into, you know, the cases that you, you create videos on and stuff. Also, if I ever like needed hoodwinked or anything like that, and the case turns out to be false, I'll come out and say it like, if I'm wrong about something, I'll totally do it. I, I would like to cause that helps disclosure, right? Yeah, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's a trick. It's like a tight wire, a tight rope because, you know, and like, how much do you talk about speculation and then, and get into that. And, you know, even if you say like, oh, this is speculation, people are going to be like, oh wait, he believes this. So I would like to say that, you know, maybe Joe, you'll join me on some live streams, maybe he won't, but it would be kind of fun to do like a one, one live a week or something like that whenever it works for anybody else. And that will definitely not take place of regular videos because I'll let you guys know a little secret right now before, before we wrap things up. You guys know I mentioned this a lot. Whoever's been mentioning Magic Eyes Only, the book by Ryan S. Wood, focuses on Crash Retrievals and, and MJ12. Who knows this book? I'm waiting. Anyways, we'll get to Jengie Squish real fast before I talk about that. Thank you so, dude, your profile picture is valid. Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that. So this, this book, Magic Eyes Only is, I fully recommend this. I'm not sponsored by the author, by the way, about Crash Retrievals and MJ12. The author of this book, Ryan S. Wood, whose father Robert S. Wood, who worked contracting for various defense companies and had a lot to say about MJ12, UAP and so forth. I have contacted Ryan S. Wood. I know him. I've talked to him multiple times on the phone. He lives near me. I will be doing an in-person project with him, kind of doing a full dive on the MJ12 soon too. And I cannot wait for that, man. That, that's going to be an awesome case because the MJ12 is so complex. Like I can't have like a pea grain like myself understand everything right away. So something with Ryan S. Wood is going to be, be really great. Yeah. So that's really cool. We'll do more lives if you guys want. And should I keep, you got an invite to author on the show? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. So, so you remember the interview I had with, with, with Joey about Michael, I plan to do a documentary interview with him, where he and I have a full conversation, but splice throughout the conversation is different studies and anecdotes and relevant documents and kind of relevant pathways to go down, not just he and I sitting for, oh man, nobody's selling nothing here, bro. Nobody's selling nothing. But for, for that, for that video with Ryan S. Wood, kind of sit down with him, do an in-person video recording and kind of make that into a documentary. But yeah, I'll do another one of these soon guys. And if you want, should I, do you keep live streams up? Yeah. All right. Yeah, people will watch them, right? Thank you guys so much for joining. I really appreciate every single one of your views. Like we got like 140 viewers, which is, which is crazy, man. I love Zambia too. I've never been, but I've only been to Morocco, so. He's done a lot of traveling. I'd like to do some more, man. The lady was, you got, which is not going to read it, but thank you guys so much for tuning in. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate all the good questions. Yeah, this was, this was awesome. And I appreciate you hosting me here and, and, you know, having these, these few days together. It's been awesome. So we'll let the Herrera video out this as soon as possible to interview. And I'm super excited to see what you guys think, because I'd like to open up some more discussion about that. All right. Peace. All right. Thanks, gang.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/azC7-UBRBSw/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Angela Hill</li> <li>Anonymous</li> <li>Arrow</li> <li>Arthur Stansel</li> <li>Ashton</li> <li>Barney Hills</li> <li>Bernie</li> <li>Bertie</li> <li>Bob</li> <li>Bob Jacobs</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Boxie Brown</li> <li>Brandon Fugle</li> <li>Bruce Buffer</li> <li>Bruce Buffer's</li> <li>Chai</li> <li>Charles Hall</li> <li>Chris Leto</li> <li>Chris Mellon's</li> <li>Client Privileges</li> <li>Crap</li> <li>Curb</li> <li>Dan Sherman</li> <li>David</li> <li>David Gresh</li> <li>David Gruss</li> <li>David Rush</li> <li>Dean Johnson</li> <li>Django</li> <li>Dodie</li> <li>Doug Way</li> <li>Edward</li> <li>Eisenhower</li> <li>Eric Hecker</li> <li>Forgotten Language</li> <li>Gary Nolan</li> <li>Gerb</li> <li>Gerb Gerbs</li> <li>Gert</li> <li>Gray</li> <li>Greer</li> <li>Gresh</li> <li>Grush</li> <li>Harry</li> <li>Heineck</li> <li>Herman Auberth</li> <li>Hunter</li> <li>JSA</li> <li>Jack</li> <li>Jacques Malay</li> <li>Jacques Valais</li> <li>James</li> <li>James Fox</li> <li>Jason Sands</li> <li>Jason Sans</li> <li>Jason Thans</li> <li>Jay Sock</li> <li>Jengie Squish</li> <li>Jeremy Corbell</li> <li>Jesus</li> <li>Jim</li> <li>Jimmie</li> <li>Joe</li> <li>Joel</li> <li>Joey</li> <li>Joey Michael's</li> <li>John Stuart</li> <li>Johnny</li> <li>Johnny Live</li> <li>Johnson</li> <li>Joni Foster</li> <li>Julian Grocks</li> <li>Kenneth Arnold</li> <li>Kirk Patrick</li> <li>Kirk Patrick's</li> <li>Kirkpatrick</li> <li>Lou</li> <li>Matt Ford</li> <li>Max</li> <li>Michael</li> <li>Michael Herrera's</li> <li>Mike</li> <li>Nathan</li> <li>Obama</li> <li>Patrick</li> <li>Polaris</li> <li>Pre Greer's</li> <li>Quitter</li> <li>Richard Dolan</li> <li>Rob</li> <li>Robert S.

In fact, many countries around the world have stories of crashes of non-human intelligence that rival the intrigue, cover-up, and credibility of the infamous crash that occurred in the New Mexico Desert in 1947. Whether this be Shag Harbor Canada, Maje Brazil, or others, tantalizing and perplexing stories of UFO crashes are not isolated to the United States. So today, let's investigate a severely underexplored UFO retrieval case that may give us the greatest insights into U.S. craft recovery protocol that allegedly occurred in northern Mexico in Coyame, Chihuahua, in the summer of 1974. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so much for joining me today as we dive into a gripping and underrepresented crash retrieval case commonly referred to by authors as Mexico's Roswell. This case features an astounding tale to rival any case of a downed UAP, a classic crash disk, U.S. Special Forces recovery, a mysterious leaked report describing the event, the death of the Mexican military retrieval force, and much, much more. Is this case that has hardly seen any covering factor fiction? Join me today as we try and find out. And before we get started, it is worth noting primary sources for this case are few and far between. I will primarily be referencing the work of authors and first-hand investigators into the Coyame case, Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte and their book, Mexico's Roswell, the Chihuahua UFO Crash, and follow-up piece, The Coyome Incident, as well as Leonard Stringfield's UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report 7 Part 9, and Ryan S. Wood's masterpiece, Magic Eyes Only, which gives this case a medium to high level of authenticity. In the early 1980s, whispers of a 1974 collision between a small private plane and disk-shaped UFO occurring near Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico began circulating. Tales of dead Mexican soldiers who initially recovered the craft in an American recovering team who relieved the corpses of the craft wreckage began to rise and follow these whispers. In 1994, legendary UFO crash retrieval researcher Leonard Stringfield would state, quote, I heard of the Chihuahua case before, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The only detail I vaguely recall is that the U.S. military team had covertly crossed into Mexico to retrieve the object, end quote. It wasn't until 1992 on an electronic bulletin board, an anomalous document titled, quote, Research Finding on Chihuahua Disk Crash, end quote, would be posted, commonly referred to as the Dineb Report, which we will discuss in much greater detail later. This shadowy, possibly leaked or purposefully leaked memo of unknown origin details the communications of one J.S. to all Dineb team members. In early summer of 1993, paper copies of this document would be mailed anonymously to UFO researchers such as Elaine Douglas, who shared the original documents with Stringfield. This anonymous mailing to select researchers reminds me strongly of the origins of the MJ-12 documents. The Dineb Report serves as our primary document describing this case. I find it crucial to read this document in its entirety as it serves as the greatest analysis of this mysterious case. Afterwards, we will investigate some of the key aspects of this report and event further, so without further ado, let's dive right into this 1974 recovery story. To all Dineb team members from J.S. date, 23rd March 1992, subject, Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disk Crash, text. In 25 Augs 74 at 2207 hours, U.S. air defense radar detected an unknown approaching U.S. airspace from the Gulf of Mexico. Originally, the object was tracked at 2200 knots on a bearing of 325 degrees and an altitude of 75,000 feet, a course that would intercept U.S. territory about 40 miles southwest of Corpus Christi, Texas. After approximately 60 seconds of observation at a position of 155 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, the object simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots, turning to a heading of 290 degrees and began a slow descent. It entered Mexican airspace approximately 40 miles southwest of Brownsville, Texas. Radar attracted approximately 500 miles to a point near the town of Coyame in the state of Chihuahua not far from the U.S. border. There, the object suddenly disappeared from the radar screens. During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at 45,000 feet, then descended to 20,000 feet. The descent was in level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level was maintained for approximately 5 minutes. The object was tracked by two different military radar installations. It would have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it is assumed that no civilian radar detected the object due to a lack of any such reports. The point of disappearance from radar screens was over a barren and sparsely populated area of northern Mexico. At first, it was assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon, and a watch was kept for any reemergence of the object. None occurred. At first, it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because of the high speed and descending flight path, but meteors normally travel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth arc, not in steps. And meteors do not normally make a 35 degree change in course. Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called. However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, the object turned to a course that would not immediately take it over US territory. The alert was called off within 20 minutes after the object's disappearance from the radar screen. 52 minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic indicated that a civilian craft had gone down in that area. But it was clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso International with a destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have been tracked over the Gulf of Mexico. It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area at the same time. Within daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for the missing plane. Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radio report that records from the missing plane had been spotted from the air. Just immediately came a report of a second plane on the ground a few miles from the first. After a few minutes, an additional report stated the second plane was circular shaped and apparently in one piece, although damaged. A few minutes after that, the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts. The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two additional government agencies also received reports. But such has not been confirmed as of this date. The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team. The speed with which this team and equipment was assembled suggests that this was either a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event. In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States and Mexican government that the U.S. recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to quote-unquote assist. These reports were met with professional ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation. By 2100 hours, 26 AUG 74, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort Bliss. Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured area. These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings. Eyewitness indicates that there are three smaller craft, very probably UH-1 Hueys from the description. There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a sea stallion. All from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Fort Bliss personnel. Satellite and Recognizant's aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crash disc and civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded onto flatbed trucks. Later flights confirmed the convoy had departed the area heading south. At that point, the CIA had to make a choice, either to allow this unknown aircraft to stay in the hands of the Mexican government or to launch the recovery team, supplemented by any required military support to take the craft. There occurred, however, an event that took the choice out of their hands. High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited areas or major roads. Recogn showed no activity and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters had ceased. At low altitude, high-speed overflight was ordered. The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with doors open and two human bodies laying on the ground beside the two vehicles. The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team, but the actual launching was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel. It was not until 1438 hours that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss. The four helicopters followed the border down to Bercito, then turned and entered Mexican airspace north of Candelaria. They were over the convoy site at 1653 hours. All convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks. Some recovery team members dressed in bioprotection suits reconfigured the straps holding the object onto the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the sea stallion. By 1714 hours, the recovered object was on its way to US territory. Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery team gathered together the Mexican vehicle and bodies, then destroyed all with high explosives. This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air collision. At 1746 hours, the Hueys departed. The Hueys caught up with the sea stallion as it re-entered US airspace. The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately 25 miles northeast of Valentine. There, they landed and waited until 0-2-5 hours the next morning. At that time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with the small convoy on the road besides Van Horn and Kent. The recovered disc was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being sealed totally. Some of the personnel from the Hueys transferred to the convoy. All helicopters then returned to their original basis for decontamination procedures. The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways and staying away from cities. The destination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia. Here the hard evidence thins out. One unconfirmed report says the disc was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Another says that the disc was either transferred after that to another unnamed base or was taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta. The best description of this disc was that it was 16 feet 5 inches in diameter, convex on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows. The thickness was slightly less than 5 feet. The color was silver, much like polished steel. There were no visible lights nor any propulsion means, there were no markings. There were two areas of the rim that showed damage. One showing in a regular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal around it. The other damage was described as a quote-unquote dent, about 2 feet wide. The weight of the object was estimated as approximately 1,500 pounds, based on the effect of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck. There was no indication in the document available as to whether anything else was visible in the quote-unquote hole. It seemed likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the civilian craft. That collision occurred while the object was traveling at approximately 1,955 miles per hour. Even ignoring the speed of the civilian craft, the impact would have been considerable at that speed. This is an agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being quote, almost totally destroyed end quote. What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of the civilian craft. The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with the ground. The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact. No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian craft. It is not known if any body or bodies were discovered. Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies may well have not come down near the larger pieces. Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known. Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disc as a result of the damage to a microbiological agent. There are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team. It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back with them for analysis, but there is no indication of that happening. Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what may have been a biologically contaminated body. Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because it does not involve a U.S. aircraft, nor did it occur over U.S. airspace. It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story. Nothing is known of the analysis of the craft nor its contents. Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign recovery team, nor is it known if this craft was manned or not. Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disc be taken to Atlanta, and where did the disc come from? It was first detected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U.S. air defenses extend to a much greater distance than that. If the object descended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD's space tracking has some record of the object. Alternate possibility is that it entered the Gulf of Mexico under radar limits, then, quote unquote, jumped up to 75,000 feet. Considering prior behavior exhibited by discs of this size, it is probable that the entry was from orbital altitude. The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness accounts. Documentation illegally copied and a partially destroyed document. This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead. Only in February of this year did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group. End of document. Very little, and I mean very little, is known about the origins of this mysterious-to-never report. As mentioned above, the document first appeared on early message boards in 1992, before being anonymously mailed to researchers such as Elaine Douglas and Nick Redfern. Immediately, copies made their way into the hands of Leonard Stringfield in his sublime crash retrieval status report stating, quote, reviewing the text of the report initial JS which follows, I find that it is authoritatively written, using correct military terminology and of note and unlike a hoax, draws the line between so-called hard evidence and that which is speculative, end quote. What is crucial to remember here is Stringfield had heard rumors of this case around a decade prior, and let's note in Stringfield's own words, when presenting his initial retrievals of the third kind at Mufon in 1978, he was, quote, unquote, informed circuitously by the CIA several days in advance. It would be inadvisable for him to discuss crash information in Mexico or West Germany. So the author of this piece, JS, seems to have intimate knowledge gathered by primary sources about the incident and desired the release of evidence to interested parties, i.e. the Deneb team. Is JS an acronym or a name? While Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte hypothesize JS is an acronym for a department within the US government, such as joint staff or joint services, perhaps the Deneb team was a name for an internal USG investigation group during the, quote, unquote, dark ages of UAP, as I like to call them. We know there is a massive gap of any official UAP programs within USG, from the ending of Blue Book in 1969 to the creation of ASAP slash ATIP in 2007, and from the words of Lu Elizondo, we do know unknown UAP programs were operating in the 1980s. Or with recent revelations of the UAP task force utilizing top secret online forums to discuss UAP, maybe the Deneb team was a similar group of intelligence community professionals who used the early internet message boards to discuss obfuscated data on crash retrieval cases. What is also interesting to note is the, quote, file UFO 3263, and, quote, indicating the Koyame report is one of many studied by Deneb and JS. Whether JS is an individual or group with intimate knowledge into the Koyome incident, it seems the author does not have a direct line of information from the named CIA, NORAD, or other agencies we kind of guess, such as the NRO or NGA. The facts were, quote, gathered from two eyewitness accounts, documentation illegally copied and a partially destroyed document. This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead. Only in February of this year, 1992, did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group, end quote. JS even states multiple times, he or they are unaware of the analysis of the craft, the craft's ultimate destination, and other details such as the inclusion of bodies. Deneb itself is a highly luminous blue star originated in the constellation Cygnus, one of the eldest constellations recognized by early civilizations. The star is a supergiant with luminosity equal to 60,000 souls or Earth's suns. The Milky Way's Great Rift, a critical junction in the galaxy where the Milky Way splits into two long sides, begins near Deneb into Cygnus. This particular area held special significance to ancient stargazers, and of particular note, southern Mexico shamans who referred to the rift as Zibalba B, the birth of all life. The Deneb report describes an extremely unlikely chance of a collision between a UFO with a civilian light plane, which is one of the most key aspects to this case. According to the report, civilian air traffic had indicated the crash of a civilian aircraft along the route of El Paso, Texas to Mexico City. The Deneb team made inquiries into the FAA to identify the airport, but received no documents concluding the plane was of Mexican origin. And unfortunately, examining U.S. 1974 aircraft crashes such as aircraft accident reports from Embry Riddle University yields no results either. Aviation Safety Network additionally lists no crashes in the year of 1974 occurring in Mexico. Many researchers such as Torres and Uriarte believe the craft would have been a Cessna 180 light aircraft. This is due to the last detection of the UFO by U.S. air defense radar at 20,000 feet or under. Since this aircraft has a service ceiling of 17,700 feet, the authors of Mexico's Roswell guessed the craft to be a perfect fit for a covert, low altitude, and slow speed craft. So if this case is real, that likely leaves us with a craft performing illegal operations in a Cessna 180 such as drug smuggling operations. In 1974, anti-drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico was an extremely pertinent issue. Let's reference this discussion between U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Mexican President that occurred on October 21, 1974, just two months after our crash story. The Mexican President states, quote, along the 3,000 kilometer border, it is very easy for small planes to take off and land in small private ranches. According to Torres and Uriartes' follow-up book to Mexico's Roswell the Coyame Incident, the two mentioned the August 1974 death of a 50-year-old Mexican pilot Enrique Riviera Gutierrez as reported in El Fronterizo of Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua. I've personally been unable to track this paper, but the authors discussed that the man died on August 30, 1974 from horrific injuries sustained in a plane crash on an unknown date prior to the article. The authors argue this could possibly be the pilot mentioned in the Dineb report, but I find that highly unlikely, due to the collision of a UFO and private plane at thousands of feet altitude. Beside some alleged aircraft parts discovered in the crash region by Torres and Uriartes, we really have nothing to work with here in terms of tracking down this plane. The Dineb reports makes numerous mention to the CIA, quote, the radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA, possibly as many as two additional government agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date. The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team. The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that it was either a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event, end quote. I am once again drawn to this article by the incredible Christopher Sharpe, which accuses the CIA's Office of Global Access of playing a central role in UFO crash retrieval since 2003. The article states the OGA coordinates with Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, amongst others to collect craft. The implication of the CIA and the Dineb report leads us to suspect departments within the CIA have engaged in crash retrievals far before the OGA's creation in 2003. And unfortunately, we can find CIA FOIA requests such as F-2007-00637 alleged mid-air collisions near Coyame, Mexico on 825 or 26 1974 with no results. However, we still do have some really interesting clues to pursue. The role of the OGA in UFO crash retrievals as described by Sharpe's anonymous source closely resembles the role of the CIA in the Dineb report. According to Sharpe's source, quote, they are basically a facilitator for people to get in and out of countries. They are very clever at being able to get anywhere in the world they want to, end quote. And an additional source of Sharpe stated, quote, the task at hand is simply to get into the custody and protect the secrecy of it. The actual physical retrieval is done by the military, but it's not kept under military control because they have to keep too many records, so they start moving it out fairly quickly into private hands, end quote. In the Dineb report, the CIA gathered intelligence on the UFO and assembled a recovery team who we will later learn may have all been retired U.S. armed forces. The UFO was then taken covertly by an unknown convoy to Atlanta, Georgia where, by the way, we can find a Lockheed Martin complex located in Air Force Plant 6, less than 30 miles outside of Atlanta. In Lockheed's own words, this location offers, quote, skunkworks work in advanced development, end quote. And while Lockheed Martin was founded in 1995, we can clearly see one of its precursors, the Lockheed Company, engaged in C-130 work in Marietta, Georgia since the 1950s. And what's even stranger here is the existence of the Lockheed Martin Georgia Nuclear Aircraft Laboratory known as AFP number 67, which served as Lockheed's lab for investigating the feasibility of nuclear aircraft. The site was closed in 1971 and acquired by the city of Atlanta, but this is still a very interesting connection. Two sources in the Daily Mail told Sharp, alongside JSOC, nuclear weapons experts such as the Nuclear Emergency Support Team or NEST perform retrieval operations. With this in mind, the Koyame case reminds me of another case we covered a lot earlier, Jonathan Wagan. Let's remember the details of this testimony. What is confirmable here is the CIA's involvement in 1997's Operation Laser Strike in Peru to engage counter-narcotics. According to Wagan, the personnel he encountered after observing a crashed UAP in the jungles of Peru approached him from a nearby land at CH-47 twin rotor copter. The men's uniforms range from black fatigues, DOE rain jackets, and hazmat suits. In this video, I went into why NEST were likely candidates for the team Wagan encountered. A key relation to Koyame here is the presence of hazmat suits and the adverse mental effects Wagan claimed to have suffered such as intense and unexplainable fear when close to the craft. According to the report, this rapid reaction team was flown from their staging area in Fort Bliss, Texas to the crash site from four helicopters, guest by JS to be UH-1 Hueys and one larger helicopter like a CH-53 Super Stallion. The helicopters were flown in from an unknown location and assembled in a secure area. Crucial to note, JS states these craft were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings. Signifying the vehicles may have been utilized specifically for clandestine operations. Fort Bliss may sound familiar to some, and in fact may be crucial to research moving forward. Fort Bliss is mentioned by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his book The Day After Roswell. According to Corso, debris and bodies from the 1947 Roswell crash were shipped to Fort Bliss, Texas. There aren't many other connections to Fort Bliss and UAP besides a handful of blue book sighting, but this really could be some interesting research going forward. And a quick side note, the team was allegedly given intelligence by the CIA gathered from satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight of the disk in plane collision. Intelligence via plane may have come from the El Paso Intelligence Center, known as Epic, established at Fort Bliss in 1974, possibly an EP-3E established in 1972, and the satellite imagery as discussed by Noah Torres likely came from the fleet of keyhole spy satellites put into orbit around 1971. These satellites were primarily operated by the NRO. Perhaps this is one instance of highly classified, high-res satellite imagery of crashed UAP David Grush has referred to. Curious to me here is how the Dinep report states once surveillance showed the Mexican convoy had stopped an aerial photography show two soldiers laying motionless on the ground, the recovery team's departure was delayed for the arrival of additional equipment, presumably hazard protection and explosives, and two additional personnel. Who were these additional personnel and were they possibly munitions experts sent to scrub contaminated crash sites? Upon securing the craft, the team loaded the vehicle onto a large truck and proceeded to original base for decontamination. But before leaving the site, the Dinep report states the Mexican vehicles, bodies, and civilian light plane were all destroyed with high explosives. This haste to destroy the site, delayed departure for additional crew, and refusal to bring Mexican bodies back for analysis, leads me to believe the American recovery team were possibly aware of the contamination that killed the soldiers beforehand and had highly trained explosive experts desanitize the site. Noah Torres wonders if the explosive used was an MK-54 SADM suitcase nuke. Carrying the smallest yield of 10 tons, such an explosive would effectively sterilize the site while keeping residual effects and damage to local population almost null. After all, in his 2000 paper Radiation Neutralization of Stored Biological Warfare Agents with Low Yield Nuclear Warheads, Hans Kruger argues fissile debris and fireballs can actually destroy biological agents. Initially when reading the Dinep report and still partly to today, I wonder if the US recovery team had killed the Mexican soldiers. J.S. and Dinep do not have the full picture here yet seem to have some understanding what happened to the men, quote, unfortunately what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known. Speculation ranges from a chemical release from the disc as a result of the damage to a microbiological agent, end quote. There still remains the possibility that the US team did in fact kill the soldiers in a hasty decision to prevent them from returning to base with UAP debris, and this does warrant further investigation. I can't help but to think back to David Grush, who mentioned numerous times crimes had been committed to maintain UAP secrecy. So if we adhere to Dinep, some contaminant from the down saucer led to the deaths of all soldiers on the Mexican recovery team. Possibly this was due to handling of bodies, reminding me of the police officer who allegedly died after touching a non-human intelligence bean in the Varginia Brazil case. But the report makes specific mention it is unaware if the disc was manned or not. Possibly the contaminant leaked from the quote, irregular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal around it, end quote, observed on the crashed craft. Fantastic enough we do have some absolutely fascinating references here, nestled within the MJ-12 first annual report lies a passage within Section F, government policy of control and denial. Here the Majestic-12 panel cites their concern regarding several SED, Sandia National Labs personnel who came in contact with UFO debris and bodies. One technician collapsed while attempting removal of a body, one went into a coma for four hours when attempting to place an NHI body in a bag. All four technicians who suffered effects were rushed to Los Alamos but all four died of seizures and profuse bleeding. The report states upon inconclusive autopsies it appeared all four suffered from some form of toxin or highly contagious disease, extremely disturbing here as point 13 which states quote in the opinion of the senior atomic energy medical advisor, current medical equipment and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with a large scale outbreak of the alien virus end quote. But that's not all. I recently spoke about the US Army's brief interplanetary phenomenon unit denied to exist but proven through FOIA requests and only remembered by the Army through institutional memory. This unit was an Army in-house project and an interest item for an unnamed assistant chief of staff for intelligence. Well within Ryan S. Woods Majestic-12 files we can find an IPU summary report. This document discusses that all military and civilian personnel dealing with recovery operations operated on strictly need to know intelligence. Besides mention of the Kirtland crew performing functions very well, the report discusses severe nervous breakdowns and suicides by MPs. The report then goes on to state ground personnel from Sandia experienced some form of contamination resulting in the deaths of three technicians. So as far back as the 1940s according to the majestic documents technicians and other personnel have actually died from biological or toxic effects from craft and bodies. One of the most fascinating and possibly fruitful aspects of this investigations come from the open sourced encyclopedia site Wikipedia. Since 2008 Wikipedia featured a brief report on the Koyama UFO crash referencing the Dineb report, a UFO casebook article, link in the description, and one of our references Mexico's Roswell by Torres and Uriarte. The entry featured nothing new or noteworthy and that remained the case until September of 2012 when user Mercy 11 radically altered the article, adding names and intriguing details for the US recovery team and crash in general. Quote, at the US military radar airbase four Huey helicopters were readied up as well as a 15 man recovery team headed to Koyama, Mexico. The American group included Captain Lawrence Murley, Lieutenant Randall Bishop, Lieutenant Eduardo Ramirez, Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes, Sergeant Terrence Miles, and Lieutenant Jerome Smith, all retired US armed forces personnel. The group entered Mexico surreptitiously after intercepting a Mexican radio communication giving away the location of the crash site, end quote. Besides the names listed which we will explore shortly, Mercy 11 added two spectacular pieces of information. The recovery team included 15 members and all were retired US armed forces personnel. This suggests the recovery team was not involving active military, but some experienced, assembled, possibly private industry seasoned operators adjacent to US military and the intelligence community. But Mercy 11's additions don't stop here. The user seemingly adds names for all four deceased Mexican soldiers, quote, a short distance from the wreckage was also an olive green jeep belonging to the Mexican military and containing the bodies of four Mexican soldiers in it. The soldiers were Captain Rogelio Argueyes-Gonzalez, Sergeant Teofilo Margarito Puebla, Corporal Jose Trinidad Maraz, and Corporal Ricardo Velasquez, their bodies displayed signs of death by asphyxiation, end quote. And here is where the story gets strange, the author of Mexico's Roswell attempted to reach out to Mercy to discover where the user sourced this information, especially due to the fact existing citation for this section on a history and event cited the UFO casebook article mentioned above in a documentary titled UFO Hunters Unexplained Mexico's Roswell the Koyame Crash, neither of which featured any of this information. Yuriyate and Torres received a response from Mercy 11 in regards to where he found this information, but Mercy doubled down linking once again to this UFO Hunters episode. Upon following up, Mercy 11 stated, quote, I suspect what happened is that I saw the information at some other site, which I had on my screen at the moment, but in another window, which I failed to attribute and record properly, end quote. But again, does not link to this information which I nor any other researcher can find. Soon after these 2013 correspondences, we find the entire page for the incident deleted in 2014 by admin Scotty Wong, who shortly after retired his account. The entirety of this Wikipedia page's existence is incredibly suspicious, but let's try to analyze the data given. We are given a list of American names and to be honest, very little to work with. I can find almost nothing about Captain Slorence Murley, discovering only one Utah-based individual who left for the armed forces near the tail end of World War II, no rank or detail of service are given. Other data or lack thereof is available for Lieutenant Randall Bishop. We can find an Indiana man who lived from 1932 to 2020. Bishop was a Pershing Rifles member while attending the University of Kentucky. He left university to join the US Air Force where he served in the Korean War as a warzone air traffic controller. After his service, Bishop moved to Indiana to be a teacher, but let's take a second to remember the significance the infographics whistleblower put on the Korean War in the program, as well as the significance of this general area of Indiana. Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes has almost zero footprint outside of a famous US Civil War soldier. The only somewhat modern day reference I can find to a Benjamin Rhodes exists within a 1989 issue of American Legion. One Mr. Rhodes out of Della Field, Wisconsin served as a post commander for the Legion, however, it is unknown whether he was armed forces or not. We can find an active duty reference for 1 Terence Miles at the time of April 21, 1993 in this edition of the Guantanamo Bay Gazette, Senior Chief Petty Officer Terence Miles as mentioned here. Of course, this breaks Mercy 11's claims that all operators were retired US armed forces, however, is it possible the sergeant re-enlisted thus furthering his rank? Zero records are available for 1 Jerome Smith, but if this was a misprint and we are looking at Lieutenant Jerome Smith, we can find a record. Deceased in 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Smith served in the US Army and was a World War II veteran. Smith transferred branches of service in 1970 to US Public Health Service, where he achieved the rank of commander before retiring in 1985. We can find a private first class at Water Ramirez who served in World War II and earned a distinguished service cross for bravery in destroying German machine gun nests with explosives and incendiaries. There is no record I can find of any promotion to Lieutenant. And it's key to note, some of these names could be legitimate, all could be legit, or all made up nonsense from Mercy 11. We just don't know at this time with all of our source references. But I am working with prestigious author Ryan S. Wood to really learn how to track down actual service records of previous soldiers who have served, so I may have some update on this in the future. There is only one real lead of the Mexico Soldier's demise, and this comes from Mexican UFO researcher Alfonso Salazar. I am unable to locate this article, but Salazar found a newspaper story from El Geraldo de Chihuahua, dated October 27, 1974, that detailed the death of a group of Mexican soldiers in the crash of a quote-unquote military transport. With Noah Torres and Ruben Uriartes' field work on this case, such as finding a piece of airplane debris near the supposed crash site, we do have some witness testimony to analyze regardless of this crash site being an estimated 60 miles from the nearest town. One such group of witnesses approached Torres in 2012 at a festival in Presidio, Texas. School teacher Johnny Chambers and her 10-year-old son at the time remembered seeing a strange fireball, a quote, big explosion in the sky, end quote, on the Mexican side of the border near the Coyamae incident. The two had thought a plane had crashed in the mountain. When interviewed by Torres, John Chambers stated, within a day of the fireball, several residents observed a group of military helicopters traveling back into the US from the Mexican side, including a large twin-rotor helicopter. And I do think it's important to state these witnesses did appear in 2012, five years after Torres and Uriartes' initial reporting on the case. These could be false witnesses, but we really have no way to prove. Period other witnesses have contacted Torres, such as Melissa P. from Facebook, full name withheld by Torres, who stated, quote, my uncle was ordered to go to the Mexico Roswell by the US military. He went, came back, and was never the same, end quote. But without names or further evidence, there really isn't much to explore here. And this is kind of the case for many of the witnesses Torres met along his field investigation of the Coyamae site. Many people told of strange fireballs, strange events that occurred around August of 1974, but we really don't have too much to work off of. In a frustrating recent event, we can look to Jesus Alberto, Mexican government official who sets up legislation and hearings. Alberto is currently tasked with UFO disclosure and is intimately tied to the Nazca mummies. On March 16th of 2024, Jay Alberto posted a now deleted tweet translated to, I have the vid at your time. It's a shit from another world. Some context around this tweet showed it to be referencing the 1974 Coyamae incident. I asked Jay Alberto if he was indeed referencing the Coyamae incident and if so would he share the video with me. The only response I got was a thumbs up about the video referencing the crash. In follow up messages, I inquired how I might get my hands on the video or if Alberto had any witnesses, military or civilian I could speak to, or any military documents on the case he might be able to share with me. All requests were met with no response. I'm hoping this video can put some pressure on him to indeed release whatever video he is referring to. What's up guys, thank you so much for watching and joining me as we did this deep dive into the 1974 Coyamae UFO crash. If you're anything like me, this story is fascinating and super perplexing with so many interesting details that lead into ufology at large. But at the same time, we're left with very little documentation and resources to investigate this further. Part of the purpose of this video was to lay out the facts as we know of this case. The Dineb report, the alterations to the Wikipedia page, the eyewitnesses, some aspects of the American recovery team in the CIA's involvement in other retrieval operations allegedly, according to Chris Sharpe, put that all out there and see where this investigation can go. I know when this video goes live I will be tweeting this video at Jesus Alberto, really putting some pressure and asking him to release this video. This case is so interesting whatever video this is, whether it's reconnaissance aircraft overflight or any internal Mexican government documents on this case. Any sort of video evidence, even if it is a truck convoy of Mexican soldiers entering up north from Coyamae around the same date, could prove paramount in adding to this case. I know I said it in the video, but I'm also trying to learn from Ryan S. Wood, who I met by the way, which was awesome, I'll tell you guys all about that more, but in how to access actual service records and personal archives to learn more about the names listed on the Wikipedia site and isn't that interesting those names added. You know I have scoured the internet, I've gone through every avenue I can trying to find any mention of those names, and when all these names were uploaded together and from what reference Mercy 11 was citing here, Ryan S. Wood is also in contact with Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte, so I will be trying to talk to these authors to learn more and actually talk to them, hey did you guys follow up with Mercy, I know Mercy shut them down trying to actually get to know him and so forth, but you know let's see what they have uncovered because that document and their connection with Mercy occurred back in 2011, so who knows what they have uncovered since. What do you guys think of the case, are there any details I am missing, I still like to play with the fact the US recovery team actually killed the operators, the Mexican recovery team. I know that the Dineb report states that there was likely the chemical or biological agent that killed these guys and we also have the IPU and majestic documents too, kind of reference there and isn't that interesting the Sandia lab technicians, I know the MJ12 likes to reference Sandia at Kirtland Air Force Base quite a bit, as we saw in the Eisenhower briefing document in the 1950's slash 1955 El Indio slash Del Rio crash retrieval cases, which are pretty interesting, but you know the idea of being contaminated by craft and suffering ill effects is something I'd like to explore further. Remember in the whistleblower, the infographics whistleblower video, this whistleblower stated one of the first things that people do upon receiving a down craft is send in a team to analyze for any toxicity or any hazardous chemicals surrounding the craft, stands to reason this Mexican recovery team if they had never recovered a craft went in with soldiers with no additional protective gear and thus died from exposure, but what if the American recovery team did kill these soldiers, but let me know what you guys think about the involvement of the American recovery team and the case at large, I'm willing to bet a lot of you guys haven't really heard of this case or just kind of heard it in passing a little bit. I can't exactly remember the first time I ever heard of this case, but I think it was when the UAP caucus listed a list of a crash retrieval events to kind of pay attention to and to bring before Congress and I think either from there or from an offshoot of there I heard of this case and quickly afterwards I dove into it and found it so fascinating, especially just some of these details like a craft and a small passenger plane colliding. I know this story just requires a couple pieces of evidence to help verify further. That's why it's so frustrating. As well as diving into the origins of the Dineb report, Elaine Douglas, the researcher I spoke about who actually received the Dineb report, she passed away in 2014. She had a website. It was www.alaindouglas.com that actually had documents. I think it had a scan of the original Dineb report. When she passed, apparently her family was going to maintain her website, but no, the website is available in the web archive. I will link it in the video description, but if you try and go to the links to the Koyama instant, those are all missing. So that's very frustrating in itself. Ryan S. Wood also doesn't have the copies of the original document because it would be very great to put these kind of through a forensic test as Wood does with the MJ12 documents. But anyway, guys, again, let me know what you think about the case. Do you have any other details I glossed over in this because I've really tried to scrounge as much as I can for any information on this case. Coming up, guys, a lot of interesting videos, a lot of crash retrievals I'm going to focus on, a lot of hidden programs. I'm going to do a video on the IPU now that I've met with Ryan S. Wood. We are going to do a video on the MJ12 documents, a very kind of comprehensive documentary and overview of the MJ12 using his expertise. I also want to make a video solely on the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual I spoke about in the last video, which Ryan Wood considers to be the most crucial piece of the MJ12 documents. Besides that, of course, crash retrievals, hopefully some good interviews coming up, I hope so. We'll see about that. But thank you guys so much for watching. Please remember to like and subscribe.

This often leads to the video's feeling impersonal. But how often do you get to see a truly anomalous craft up close? Well, there is one video of a UFO filmed in Spain that, if true, is one of the best close-up views of a UFO ever recorded. Guys, I am UAPGurb, and I'm not wasting any time today. So let's do another footage analysis of one of my favorite pieces of alleged UFO footage, the famous Metapod, as filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015. This is one of my all-time favorite pieces of alleged footage that has shocking connections to other sightings and footage worldwide. So let's take a look first at our footage stabilized. Let's take a look at the footage. This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015. This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015. This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015. This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015. So what do you think after first watch? Pretty astounding, right? Similar to the fly-by video, this footage is too anomalous, too clear, and too strange to possibly be true, right? Well, let's start a little analysis and kind of see what we can uncover. I want to disclaim that I am using YouTube channel ItsBS's stabilized footage of the metapod due to the fact that the original poster of this video UFO VNI has taken down the footage as well as the 2017 reupload by YouTube channel UFO invasions. ItsBS's channel will be listed in the video description. Unlike fly-by, we can actually trace back the origins of the metapod footage. On September 7th, 2015, a man named Modesta emailed YouTube channel UFO VNI as mentioned above after reading that this channel could publish UFO footage. On screen now is the original email, and here let me read a transcription translated into English. Hello UFO VNI. I have read on your YouTube page that you can publish the video that I took the day before yesterday, September 6th, 2015, together with a friend named Moises. My name is Modesto. What we saw yesterday I sincerely know was not from here. I have been in the countryside for many years and I have been able to hear the wings of storks in flight. What we saw did not make any noise, it descended vertically and he walked away. I must admit that I am somewhat nearsighted but my friend can see hairs and quails in the same way as finding a needle in a haystack. My friend commented that he saw something moving inside the UFO. Something alive with limbs, I believe it. Due to personal reasons and the location of the sighting we do not want to give the exact location of the sighting, but I can tell you that it was near El Escorial, direction Las Navas del Marques. El Escorial is a place where strange things happen, but not in the city, but in the nearby mountains. Personally, I neither believed nor did I believe in UFOs or extraterrestrials. It simply seemed like, quote, nonsense from Uncle Iker and four other idiots, end quote. Now, that is, from that moment on, I knew that it wasn't from here, that it wasn't human. My friend Modesto, however, a little more attack at turn and from the town than me, I never known what he thought but it seems that he is not surprised to see it. After the video that I sent him and some photos that, as you will see, did not turn out very well, my friend Modesto told me, quote, here again, in reference to the object. After asking him about the meaning of his expression, he did not want to say much more, except that it is not the first time he has seen it and that his father, now deceased, had also seen it. If it is of importance to him, I will ask, give him the GPS data and exact location, but only for his investigation so that he does not make said data or the relationship with the video public. The place is called redacted and is at the coordinates redacted in the direction in which he went was north south. I asked for strict rigor and commitment to save my personal or contact information. On the contrary, I send and deliver the video and I give it to you. For your use and disposition as you please. PS, I'll send you the video later with a link to the cloud or if you prefer, I'll send you the micro SD card by email. What stands out to me about this email? Well, for one, the sender Modesto claims that he is Modesto and his friend Moises recorded the footage. Later on, he says, quote, my friend Modesto. Is this a careless mistake of using pseudonyms as the sender was already unwilling to provide the exact location of the sighting? Anyways, Modesto goes on to state that this was not the first time his friend had seen this object and that his father had seen it also. Modesto's companion also said he saw something moving inside of the UFO. It's unknown to me why UFO V and I took down this video, perhaps at Modesto's request, but I have contacted him to learn more. Posts about this footage began popping up around the internet almost immediately, as seen in this now taken down Portuguese forum on September 8, 2015, called ETS and ETC. Translating this page, we can see the site does not know if the video is real or fake, but is impressed nonetheless. What caught this site's attention was realistic zoom, very realistic focus and blur, the shape of the UFO, and similarities to the 2006 La Bruja in Mexico. I'll cover this soon. A post also appeared on the site Third Phase of the Sun on September 11, 2015, which additionally detailed UFO V and I's correspondence with Modesto. I'm willing to bet you've probably never seen a UFO in this shape, especially one structured like such a physical craft in which a solid metallic reflective looking material makes up the back bulk of the craft in a very logical design with a front-facing transparent material that looks almost similar to glass for, you know, possible viewing opportunities. Some argue, like Third Phase of the Sun, that they can make out a bean resting inside of the craft. However, I disagree here and think this is simply the reflection of sunlight on the transparent material on the front face of the craft. This pod features three of five characteristics of UAP as listed by ATIP and Lou Elizondo. Instantaneous acceleration as seen in the altitude drop, anti-gravity slash no visible signs of propulsion, and low observability. The craft exhibits intelligent flight characteristics including that sudden drop in altitude, standstill and winds as we can hear from camera wind interference, linear traversal away from the recorder, and variable stable rotation along its x-axis. Especially take note here when the craft's rotation goes from counterclockwise to clockwise, exhibiting variable acceleration in both methods of rotation. I'd like to thank Reddit user UNVMBKY for translating the audio in this footage. I'm going to overlay his translation with the original footage, and to note something added by NVBKY, the audio sounds like it has been processed with a noise reduction filter, either added in post processing or directly applied by the camera to filter out the wind. As you can guess, many have tried to debunk this sighting as a balloon, such as this heart custom made balloon, or balloon tent, and no I'm not kidding, this comparison with this flatable tent is used as an actual source for a debunk, or possibly an object suspended on a string which is the same explanation used to try and debunk the very real McMinnville photographs, and lastly CGI. The CGI debunkers enjoy using these three frames of craft jitter when analyzing the craft altitude drop stabilized, but even the balloon crowd detracts from this argument on Mick West's website Metabunk, in which the jitters are consistent with the craft, or in this case balloon, experiencing altitude drops in air currents. Of course, I'm no VFX artist so I cannot comment on any visual artifacts that could either confirm or deny the footage's authenticity, but what I can tell you is that for me, this footage passes the simple eye test, and I can draw attention to half a dozen pieces of other footage in which this same craft is shown. While we review these other sightings, I want you to take note of a couple things in all of the footage we are about to view. The overall crescent moon shape of the pod, the transparent glass-like material on one face of the pod, reflectivity of sunlight off the craft, and the vertical orientation in which the craft stands when it rotates about its z-axis. The first observation I can track of the metapod shape is the famous Los Perracadistas de Maip\u00fa or the parachutes of Maip\u00fa footage taken in 1998 in Peru. In this footage, we can see what appears to be five or more pots with the same body and reflective paneling as our metapod footage. Now, let's cover the aforementioned Monterey Witch or La Bruja as seen in Mexico in 2006. This footage appears to show the backside, the non-transparent side of the metapod moving away from the recorder, through some hills and brush in the same vertical positioning I mentioned earlier. In 2021 in Vancouver, the same pod was recorded. Here we observe the same crescent moon shape and reflectivity in sunlight. Some interesting things to take note of by the OP of this footage. Three of these objects appeared, close together at first maybe 20 feet from each other moving north. They moved on a horizontal plane, two of the objects then ascended up fast in the third continued horizontal north until out of sight. The two went upwards, then one continued north until it disappeared and the others west until it disappeared. And now we get to possibly the most crucial corroborating multiple sightings of the metapod craft. In 2022, a couple frames allegedly leaked from a U.S. Navy, Blue Angel cockpit recording of a UFO dropping from the clouds. Similar to our flyby footage, this is a second generation recording if the mouse on the screen didn't give it away. Take a look at these frames below. Pretty incredible, right? Let's go frame by frame to compare to the metapod. In these three frames, we see the metapod descending rapidly in a horizontal orientation. Appearing as though the transparent face is facing away from the craft's trajectory. Interestingly enough, four other signatures appear alongside the craft. In this frame, we see the back of the craft facing the ground with the transparent face oriented towards the sky. If this leak is true and believe me, I'm still trying to get to the bottom of it, the metapod shape is a legitimate form of UAP. Some like to compare the metapod to the gimbal footage and while it matches the outline of the FLIR footage, I am hesitant to make this comparison seen as the FLIR footage does not necessarily reflect the object's true shape, so we will at least keep this explanation to gimbal in mind, but not claim it as fact. And lastly, we have a hang glider cruising through the skies of Texas in 2023, appearing to observe the metapod. While early and late frames of this video accurately show the vertically positioned pod, the front facing view throws some doubt into the footage's credibility in my opinion as it does not match the metapod seen in other videos. Of all the videos we have reviewed, this in my opinion has probably the best chance of being something prosaic or misidentified like a balloon. A 15 to 20 minute video for a 1 to 2 minute piece of footage? Of course! I'm UAPGurb, you guys know what we're getting into, I won't settle for anything less than a full analysis. I hope you guys enjoyed this look into the metapod footage. I remember when this piece of footage first dropped, I was so fascinated, I had to get to the bottom of it, because there were a couple of accounts on various platforms like Reddit who reuploaded the video saying it was filmed in Denver, which is my city, which was just a fallacy, so I'm not sure where that came from, but remember this footage originates in Spain, but what do you guys think about this metapod footage? Is it too fantastic to be true, or is it real? I know the memes, I know it looks like the show me what you got heads from Rick and Morty, but this craft at least to me looks like the real deal, and it's shocking that it almost looks like a single beam observation craft with the transparent window that almost seems like glass. It's so enigmatic, I don't even know, I don't even know where to begin thinking about the implications of this craft and what is piloting it, especially with the non-observable propulsion methods, but I wanted to get this video out today guys, I know today it is the, I think the 11th of February, the Sol Foundation just released a bunch of interviews with Grush, Chris Mellon, Kevin Knuth, Hal Putoff, so the next video which I'm going to try to get out as quick as possible, I'm going to be reviewing all those panels and kind of putting out my thoughts, so I wanted to get this footage out, and of course I couldn't slack, had to make sure it was pretty beefy, so please remember to like and subscribe, leave a comment which you thought, let's get a dialogue started, and thank you so much for tuning in guys, I'll catch you guys on the next episode I put out, appreciate it.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/i6fitvV-aO0/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>ATIP</li> <li>Blue Angel</li> <li>Chris Mellon</li> <li>Grush</li> <li>Hal Putoff</li> <li>ItsBS</li> <li>Kevin Knuth</li> <li>La Bruja</li> <li>Lou Elizondo</li> <li>Maip\u00fa</li> <li>Mick West's</li> <li>Modesta</li> <li>Modesto</li> <li>Moises</li> <li>Monterey Witch</li> <li>Rick</li> <li>Places:</li> <li>Denver</li> <li>Mexico</li> <li>Modesto</li> <li>Peru</li> <li>Reddit</li> <li>Spain</li> <li>Sun</li> <li>Texas</li> <li>Vancouver</li> <li>Organizations:</li> <li>CGI</li> <li>ETC</li> <li>El Escorial</li> <li>El Escorial Madrid</li> <li>ItsBS</li> <li>Los Perracadistas de Maip\u00fa</li> <li>McMinnville</li> <li>Metapod</li> <li>NVBKY</li> <li>PS</li> <li>Sun</li> <li>U.S. Navy</li> <li>UAP</li> <li>USG</li> <li>Uncle Iker</li> <li>VFX</li> <li>VNI</li> <li>YouTube</li> <li>the Sol Foundation</li> </ul> <p>Download transcripts: SRT \u00b7 VTT \u00b7 JSON \u00b7 TSV</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/inyw4Vfu7Z0/","title":"The Physics of UFOs\u2013 Dr. Kevin Knuth","text":"<p>Published: 2024-03-10  \u00b7  Duration: 21:35  \u00b7  Channel: UAP Gerb</p> Description <p>A dive into Ph.D. Physicist Kevin Knuth's exploration of UAP physics.

What is going on? Are we live? I think so. Let's see. Somebody let me know in the comments if we are live and you can hear me. Okay, cool. I think we are. Let's see. David, have some names for me to check out. Let me just start, read that right away because that's interesting. Cecil B. Scott Brown is a very interesting character. He is named throughout a lot of Stephen Greer's files and in Grant Cameron's research of Dr. Eric A. Walker, both Cameron and Dr. C. B. Scott Brown wrote to University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Eric Walker to talk to him. I think C. B. Scott Brown is no longer with us, but that is a very interesting person to research and look into. But hey guys, thanks for joining today. This should be a fun stream. I got some pretty fun stuff to talk about today. Of course, it's been a busy week in the field of ufology and also we missed last Sunday. I was out of town, so we're going to do the 10K stream today. And part of the stream today, I want to share a little bit of some ongoing research I'm doing. That kind of ties into the UAPDA. I think everybody watching will find that very interesting because I sure did. And I'm really excited to see that. Let's see a couple questions. Kai, I'm sorry about the Browns. I really am, man. Maybe come over to the Bengals, bro. We got a bit better of a squad. Chris, I did see what happened with Grant Cameron and Dick Cheney. Grant Cameron is a fantastic researcher. I've been combing his files, the Grant Cameron files, for more stuff on Dick Cheney because as I talked about in my last video, Grant Cameron released his entire trove of UFO files from his decades of research. There is so much there. I haven't even begun to kind of filter through everything. As you guys know, we go through the Stephen Greer DPI archive here and then we'll do the Grant Cameron files as well because there's a lot of interesting stuff there. And Mighty Mo, yes, you are on time. Are there any interesting retrievals that have happened in the UK or nearby? Yes. There are some incidents in the 70s and 80s. A couple in England. Let me get out the handbook real fast and find those out. We got that crash retrievals. Magic Eye is only on us. There's two cases that come to mind in England. Of course, there's the rental from Forest Landing. So, M1138T, if you're listening to me, write down these dates. Garleton, England, July 16, 1963. Let me keep going. Pencrige, England, February or March of 1964. Walt, I'm sorry, I cannot speak. Walthamstow, England, April 13, 1964. Cambridge, Shire, England, January of 1965. And if you want to count North Wales, Burwin Mountains, North Wales, 74, around the same time of the Kuyame alleged incident. So, those are a couple examples. And if you want a more recent example, I would look in 1991, July, and Cheadle, Stafford, Shire, England. This is about, this is close to 1992, the alleged Long Island, New York case, which if you guys don't know that one, that's going to be a case we feature as it supposedly occurred on Long Island, New York, 1992, near Brookhaven Labs. Okay. Hey, look, man, I don't say bad words. I keep it clean on this channel, but you know, the Steelers are worse. The Steelers are worse. What's up? Good to see you, Dr. Doc. Looking to see B. Scott Brown. I have not heard of Carol Rosen or Bryce DeWitt. I have heard of Bryce DeWitt. Yes, we've talked about the Nepal Retrieval in Kathmandu in 68 in Moondust, quite a long time ago as well. That's such an interesting case. I was compiling some documents on Moondust for somebody the other day. And that, of course, was a case I sent over. What's up? What's up, dude? Broad and North. Thank you so much for the 200 Norwegian crown. I really appreciate that, man. You're the man. I love it. Thank you so much. Something or someone. So Grant Cameron is, he has a website that's called Presidential UFO. Grant Cameron has been really instrumental kind of before the age of John Greenwald and so forth in utilizing Freedom of Information Act requests and the National Archives to kind of find hidden files and letters on various individuals. This includes Wilbur B. Smith. This includes Dr. Eric K. Walker. This includes President Johnson. So Grant Cameron, of course, had early in the 2000s, 2001, called into a radio show asking Dick Cheney outright, inquiring as to his involvement with UAP programs in USG. And he just said something along the lines of, if I was briefed on that, I probably couldn't talk about it. Darth Cheney is correct. Thoughts on Jay Stratton's upcoming book. I think it'll be interesting. There seems to be a lot of drama boiling over with Jay and Lou and the whole ATIP, all SAP stuff. So we shall see how that goes. As an American, I usually only see English UAP media. Do you know of any good translated resources or channels covering any other countries, particularly Asia? I do not, actually. I do not know of any kind of channels that cover Asian materials. I would be particularly interested to hear about the history of crash retrievals in China. Of course, there's American sources of many crash retrieval cases in Cambodia, Vietnam, and so forth in the Vietnam War or conflict. But that is well worth checking out. I would also like to look into these. Could I also use metric units in my video? Yes, I will. I'm an American, but remember, I'm schooled as an engineer. So metric units are near and dear to my heart. I absolutely will. I always face this predicament. I always face this predicament. What is your MMA record? I have never fought an actual sanctioned mixed martial arts fight, but earlier this year, I did participate in a Giju Jitsu tournament and took third place in the heavyweight division. Congrats on 10K. I really appreciate that. Are you familiar with the Forgotten Languages website that has been active since 2007 and posting various articles every day? I actually got a link from Forgotten Languages. We're going to talk about it a little later today in relation to UAPDA. And yes, I do want to talk about that because I also have some good friends who kind of went down that rabbit hole a while ago and probably have some more interesting stuff to say than I do. But yes, it's very interesting. Anything on the Senator who blocked UAPDA? 2.0, Rand Paul. Everything I found was that no aerospace course donated to his campaign and that he criticized the allocation of $22 million to ATIP. So instead of Rand Paul and Mike Turner and these guys, we're going to talk about some of the lobbyists, the companies that lobbied against the UAPDA. And I'm really excited to talk about that because those are really interesting. Larry Reed worked for Lockheed. He has a book called Quantum Wave Mechanics, a dense physics textbooks that covers anti-gravity and has UFO designs. Very interesting. That is very interesting. I will have to check that out as well. The Hudson Valley Wave, interesting how many of these sightings said the bottom of the crafts had what looked like... Yes, okay. So I've been trying to talk to Ryan Wood about kind of early sightings of UFOs and possible ARVs. And the Hudson Valley Wave may be an example of early days of ARV, alien reproduction vehicles with kind of a lot of exterior opponents, triangles with seeming like a piping and not so circuitry, but almost kind of signs of manufacturing on the bottom. I think if anything that indicates maybe towards more a human-made origin, and I would really like to talk about that more. Think about the James Webb talk. I have not really been... I've not been too dialed in. I know the narrative going on right now, but to be honest, I have... I got crash retrievals and whistleblowers to talk about right now. So we'll let that play out a little bit. I'll probably kind of stay on the sidelines for that, but of course I will be updated. I have no opinion at the moment. What is your opinion on the Voronezh UFO incident where UFO landed and beans came out of the object? A lot of witnesses and KGB investigations. Was this one of the files that George Knapp smuggled out of the Soviet Union? Remind me if that was the Voronezh incident, please, because that's kind of on the tip of my tongue and I can't think right at the moment. David, Carol Rosen was the first female head of an aerospace company, Fairchild, and worked with Werner von Braun. She writes about UFOs and mentioned von Braun knew about an engineered alien invasion. Okay, that's interesting because I know a lot of people talk they like to relate Project Bluebeam or something along those lines with kind of the final words and the gravestones of Werner von Braun and of course his mentor, Herman Osberth, participated in very serious flight calculation speeds of UFOs back in the 40s. So that is interesting. Local H.J., thank you so much for the two bucks. You make the best UAP content. Keep it up. I really appreciate that, man. I absolutely will keep it up. Hopefully, there will become a time where these videos are more so a historical record versus just investigating stories. That's what I'm hoping for. Why Brazil has so many UAP sightings? They have no nuclear capability or nuclear power plants for my knowledge. I've wondered this as well. There are a lot of Brazilian fighter pilot, military pilot encounters with UFOs. And besides the Kalora's Incident, I think this was in the 80s or 90s. There's a famous incident in Brazil. It's called Night of Something. I got to find it. I'll post it in the Discord, but it's where multiple, multiple, multiple people across multiple states in Brazil all observed very similar things flying over Brazil. So this combined with the Kalora's Incident, with the Mag\u00e9 Brazil, combined with Virginia. Brazil seems to have some of the most activity of UAP outside of the U.S. And it is very interesting. That Kecksburg video was awesome. I appreciate that. That was a heck of a lot of fun to make. I want to continue along the lines of investigation for Dr. Eric Walker. I reached out to his children. I've heard nothing back. And I've also reached out to Joe Califano. If you remember, I talked about him kind of in Johnson's meeting. So I've heard nothing from him, but that'd be a person I really would like to speak to. All right, we'll get through these guys. And then there are a couple things I want to speak about. And we'll do more Q&amp;A. But I think one thing in particular, everybody will find of great interest. Excited to hear that you're familiar. I've been down that rabbit hole and I've compiled a lot of information from that site. People love to dismiss it, but there's more going on there for sure. Yes, for anybody that just joined, we're talking about the Forgotten Languages site that it was the anonymous briefing for Congress for the UAP timeline that has a lot of links to the Forgotten Languages site and references there. Very interesting. As Earth Ambassador to the Aliens, I would like to offer up Rand Paul to you, Aliens for Abduction. You could do whatever you want with them. Yeah, Rand Paul, this is a bit out of left field for him to be the primary blocker of the UAPDA. I was not expecting such a thing. What's up, Zach? Gordon Novel of JFK and Watergate fame wrote a book on reverse engineering. Kraft just learned about that recently. That is interesting. I've never heard of that. I've got to check that out. If I'm not mistaken, the Hudson Valley UAPs were responding in movement to witness thoughts. I've not heard that either. I need to check that out as well. Okay, let's keep going through these guys. We'll get through these and then a couple topics I can't wait to talk about. Everything there is available thus far with the James Webb Telescope Drama. I can't remember what Senator said. He said no comment to expose a classified briefing. There's plenty of other stuff, at least for me, my focus to talk about versus James Webb. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of good articles, maybe from Matt Laszlo, maybe from other content creators talking about this. I'll probably wait off for a little bit just because there's so much dang stuff I really want to talk about. Yes, this Brazil incident is called Night of the Flying Saucers. Radar says, another Norway incident in June of 1967. I'm not even going to try to pronounce that man, but this is similar to the Spitzberg in 1952 case. Norway also has a lot of very interesting sightings worth checking out. How do you explain to people the reasoning behind the use of the nuanced term NHI or non-human intelligence? This is because this is the term put into the congressional record, non-human intelligence, not alien, not ETs, not ultra terrestrials, not crypto terrestrials, but non-human intelligence. This is why in his interview with Ross Colthart and his appearance in the hearings last year in July of 2023, David Grush made meticulous effort to always say he's talking about non-human intelligence, never using the word alien, never using the word extraterrestrial. Then if you notice people like Sean Kirkpatrick in their interviews will always talk about, say, alien or extraterrestrial. They will hardly, if ever, use the term non-human intelligence. That is why the term non-human intelligence is so important to use in context. What exactly is this alien virus? Is this the reason they're so serious about silence? I'm not sure. Possible origins of an alien virus may come from the 1974 Koyame Mexico crash retrieval in which a team of Mexican soldiers, according to the denumber report, was killed by a biological contaminant leaking from the craft. So I'm not sure. They do use JWST for photos of planets within our solar system. Yes, they do. And they also use it for mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry, I don't know how to say that in plural form or for exoplanets. Okay, let's see. They are tool poids from... Oh, more tool poids. Cool. Well, as we talked about last week, or two weeks ago with Greer, he was talking about various forms of UAP and kind of the significance of UAP and said that defense companies like Lockheed Martin were creating almost thought forms. That was really, really interesting to me. Kecksburg video was nice and congrats on 10k sub. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that very much. Do I have any plans to visit some famous locations? I would love to, but I do have plans to go to the November 13th hearings in Washington if I can. If I can swing that, I'm going to find a dang camera guy, bring that guy, go to those. And then I've heard rumors of Seoul doing another conference in late November of 2024. If that happens as well, I will also go to that. Jimmy, I know you. I think you changed your name. Thank you so much for the $20. I very much appreciate that very, very, very much. These people are always in the background and John Lear in 1988 named a lot of interesting names of second generation MJ12 Bobby Ray Inman. Yes, absolutely. Carl Sagan, Edward Teller and Hillencoder, Senator or Senior Bush, HW Bush. Yes, especially Hillencoder. Hillencoder is of extreme interest to me. We talked about him at length as the named briefing, briefing individual of the Eisenhower briefing document and who also had some actually pretty outstanding comments on UFOs publicly. So very interesting person, Hillencoder, but also Bobby Ray Inman. I can't remember where we covered him. I think I talked about him in the, what was it? The Off World Technologies Division in relation to the Navy. I think it was, but yes, very interesting. What do you think about the phenomenon? The more they will manifest to you even in, I'm convinced the more you think about, yeah, that's like the call of the void, right? The more you stare into the this, the more it stares back at you and that's kind of a, the associated term with much, much kind of high strangeness. Kai, the thing about the Hudson Valley and all these UFO waves like Belgium being manmade is why do they fly like they are trying to be seen? It's almost like the ARVs are trying to replicate NHI behavior. Yes, this is very weird to me. I have many personal friends who are adults just because I trained Jiu Jitsu and I mean, I'm an adult too, but they're older 40s and 50s who talk about his kids, especially in the area of New York. I have one friend I trained Jiu Jitsu with who saw a triangular shaped craft with three lights flying at a very low altitude. I'm talking hundreds of feet over him. It often seems like these craft, especially triangular shaped craft, are flying at a very low elevation, almost begging to be seen. It's very strange. Looking at Thomas Bearden, I have heard Bearden's name before. I can't remember exactly where. MZ, you're from Brazil and I can say there is a lot of UFO activity here and most of it is not talked about outside of Brazil. The Claudio case is real. I'd love to hear more if you have some cases that are underrepresented and underrepresented and under explored, especially crash retrieval cases. Jango, thank you so much for the $10. You are generous with your money and I really, really, really, really, really appreciate that. The Norway incident, the Norwegian military spent several weeks diving after the object without finding anything. This reminds me of the Shag Harbor in 64 case. Okay, someone or something. Here is Kirk Patrick dodging the ET versus NHI question to a ridiculous degree. Yes, it's absurd. Kirk Patrick is the specific example. And although he's more of a Twitter troll, guys like John or Stephen Greensreet saying, oh, he's flying alien space monsters. That's another one that's a bit funny to me. Oh, sorry. What is your take on David Grush and Lou Elizondo constantly saying maybe they're from in between when referencing we don't know if they're alien or extraterrestrial? Well, Grush has talked about, especially in outtakes of his interview with Ross Coldheart for News Nation. He says he uses the term nonhuman intelligence, but also says that these are presumably extraterrestrial. But then in the congressional record also discusses the holographic universe principle and the possibility of sort of ultra dimensional beings, beings that don't necessarily originate from our 3d space. My question is why cannot it possibly it's both the this isn't a mutually exclusive thing to have extraterrestrial and sort of an ultra terrestrial even a crypto terrestrial origin. There could be a combination of these. Fan meetups and Roswell, that would be fun. Actually, I would love that. I'd love to go to to the Roswell region. Maybe we'll do a fan meetup as as we grow. That would be very interesting. Thank you for talking about the biological aspect of it. This, my friend, you cannot talk about crash retrievals without discussing biologics. This is something I learned from early. Always thought I could, especially because biologics are the most controversial part of any crash retrieval story. I thought, you know, maybe I can stay a little bit away from this, but no, absolutely not. I in fact, I love speaking about biologics. What's your opinion on JRot? Any plans to cover this JRot? If anybody doesn't know, this is the extraterrestrial being allegedly covered from the Kingman crash in 53. According to this story, there were two JRots captured live. One EBE, it was called a, I can't remember. It was like EBE 53 AZ or something like that to denote Arizona and the year and the extraterrestrial. One was sent to Los Alamos National Labs and one was sent to S4, I believe it was. I think this is a very interesting story. And there's also claims of JRot outside of just Dan Burish, of course, who's made the JRot story very famous. And he talks about JRot being housed in a very secure facility. And I think the fifth floor underground in S4, where he would take blood samples from this creature as it would be brought into sort of like a containment dome, like if you've seen boy in the bubble, like that. But there's also, who am I thinking about? I'm thinking about a, why can I, Bill Youhouse, who has talked about JRot and the flying saucer simulator that was installed at S4 from the Kingman crash. But JRot's very interesting. Yay. Your super chat got ignored, Chris. Oh, I'm so sorry, man. Chris, thank you so much. I'm sorry, man. I try to answer everything. That's totally my bad. Zable on need to know if you guys don't know Bryce Zable, he runs a co-podcast with Ross Coltheart on YouTube called need to know. He said, Sagan knew a lot more about UFOs. Lear and 88 called him out as the second generation of MJ12. He was in the hearings in 68 too. Yes, absolutely. Even Ryan Wood has talked about Carl Sagan in regards to the majestic documents quite a bit. I think multiple people now, Lear and Ryan Wood and maybe even Stanton Friedman has commented on this, that Carl Sagan was secretly rather involved in UAP. But I'm sorry for missing that, man. That's truly my bad. Truly my bad. Let's see. We talked about this a little bit, TF, the James Webb telescope. There's definitely the congressman who talked about note, said no comment in regards to a James Webb briefing, but I will probably wait to cover that if covering it at all, just because I like to have a lot of time to sit down with my projects. Now, a lot of developing stories are a little bit tough to cover. Trollmama, thank you so much for the $20. I really appreciate that. Be a BJJ and MMA beast. Hold down 10K YouTube channel. Thank you very much. I will try to continue to be a beast. When they say they walk among us, do you think imagine them being undocumented or fully integrated into the system and have families and kids? I don't know. That's actually a good question. There's of course different conflicting schools of thought. Of course, there's the valiant Thor story of the alleged extraterrestrial that I believe aided Eisenhower, was it, who almost passed for an uncanny valley effect of person. Now, I still don't have an informed opinion on if NHI is actively walking amongst humans. I have not done enough research into that, but this is something I would like to look into more, but I know the story of valiant Thor. There's also David Ike's theory of reptilians walking among us, which is very scary, but I do not know. MrBeast had a UFO sighting recently. I've never seen a MrBeast video, but I heard his videos are quite crazy. What do you make of the rumors of China's development of some kind of underwater laser propulsion system? Could this be the technological surprise we've been warned about? Possibly, because in just a few minutes, probably like 10 minutes, actually, we're going to talk a little bit about underwater, but with the US. I hope we have aliens here on earth like Rogers from American Dad. That would be hilarious. If there's NHI working alongside human scientists, like some aero whistleblowers have stated and so forth and many others, I would really, really, really like to see that. What do you think about Gary McKinnon and Hack and his supposed secret space program? If anybody doesn't know Gary McKinnon, I think this was in 2002. He hacked various military systems and found files relating to non-terrestrial officers list of parent US officers that are operating in ships throughout our solar system and possibly abroad called non-terrestrial officers. He also posted an image of a craft, I believe it was, of a USS craft and it was cigar shaped, but with almost portholes at the center, at the top and bottom, and some sort of variable surface at each end of the cylinder. His story is one of the most, it's been around in Ufology one of the longest Gary McKinnon story. Now, I think some of the controversy with him and where people start to discredit him is he says he didn't either own a printer or didn't think to grab a print of these files. However, I know Gary McKinnon is still around and I think he's evaded legal prosecution at this point and I would like to speak to him. I'd like to speak to him a lot, but the Gary McKinnon story is, that's kind of one of the OGs, the classics of Ufology and I will probably reserve judgment until I can try and talk to him or if somebody has a documentary featuring Gary McKinnon coming out, which would be interesting. Harry, thank you so much for the five bucks. It doesn't matter how much you give, I just appreciate your support. Thank you so much. I'm trying to get through all of these guys. I'm sorry for being slow. The Alagash UFO incident is a good one to check out. I have not spent any time looking into the Alagash UFO incident, so that is excellent. Feather hat talking about Sagan. When I heard Sagan might be involved, I was like, no way. Also come on, Sagan, you seem the opposite of MJ12. Yes, Sagan was also very outspoken against UAP. So was Astronmer Donald Menzel. Oh, more Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast UFO retrieval stories always have chrysalogics involved. It's Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast has talked about crash retrieval, if that's the case. I don't know how that fits into his channel, but that is interesting and I'd like to hear it. What is the full list of 12 alleged crashes that there's more than 12, but there's a lot more than 12. I would recommend reading the book Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood, which recounts almost 100 crash retrieval cases, but there's plenty more than 12, especially in the US. You got classic cases like Kecksburg, Roswell, Kingman. Why can I think of the name? There's a name I can't think of right now. Kecksburg, Long Island, a case in West Virginia, 1897, Aurora, Texas crash, the Cape Giradeau 1941 crash. There's a 2008 Needles, California. You can think of two dozen cases and I'm thinking of Aztec as the 1948 cases. I couldn't think of, but there's more than 10. There's dozens of cases you could read about. There's the San Augustine Plains. There's just so many here in the States. Let's not do the David Ike thing. Yeah, I'm probably going to stay away from talking about David Ike. That's not my realm. They travel here in faster than light tech to walk among us just to work a nine to five and pay taxes. I hope not. I hope the galactic standard isn't to work in a nine to five because that would be very depressing. Walking among us might involve hybrids from egg sperm extraction program involving abductions. There's been quite a bit of talk about hybrids of late. Don't know what to make of it. Haven't done research. Correct me if I'm wrong. I think a couple of scientists have made such mention lately, but I will be doing my research. Any chance of a video on the MAJ Brazil UFO accident? Yes, absolutely. I would recommend watching MacMave Studios video on MAJ Brazil. There's so much kind of video supporting video of the case and some really rich stories. Yes, absolutely. I got two videos I'm going to do before another crash retrieval and then we will see what crash retrieval we do then, but I promise you will get there. What way do you speculate the phenomenon relates to? Elizondo stated as the three-body problem. What aspect of that story is relevant to today? The three-body problem talks about the dark forest theory of the Fermi paradox, which if you've never heard of the dark forest theory, it's the concept that advanced extraterrestrial and kind of universe-spanning civilizations do not broadcast their location in fear and knowledge of other civilizations that will basically invade and take over and so forth. I think with Lou, this could probably tie into the threat narrative he talks about often about possible threat proposed by NHI. This could be in direct relation to something like the three-body problem and the dark forest theory, so kind of the threat narrative. Corona Clay, the one. Has there been any claims from the archaeological community of a potential UFO found on a dig to match up with Bob Lazar's claims? Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge. What do you know about the project Gary Nolan briefly talked about? Some kind of tracking system in a military-type units that will try to recover the craft before Pentagon program units get it? Okay, yeah, that's a good question. Gary Nolan was talking about basically a private crash retrieval team. This isn't like a 2004 Lockheed team. This is a team to make up modern day to try and beat USG or private retrieval teams to down UAP. I think that is a very dangerous proposition, especially if you're not utilizing Tier 1 operators. How are you going to get there before the US military and US and the program when these allegedly have things like golden domes, according to Danny Sheehan, which can detect UAP while still cloaked? How are you going to get there before these retrieval teams who, as we've heard stories of, will shoot on site and not hesitate to kill people in that area? I do not think that's a great idea and I imagine that would have an extremely low success rate. Do I have any significant updates of any of my previous videos? Yes, and those will make it into future videos. Always updates. There's never a video I do where I stop investigating then, so especially we're going to talk a little bit about an update to one of my recent videos, the Off-World Technologies Division here briefly. Any opinions on Michael Masters currently reading the extra-testrial model? I have never heard of this model, but I do know Michael Masters, but I will check that out, my friend. George Nicolakis. A hundred crash retrieval. Okay, now I'm sure they have the complete Star Trek pack, mind-blowing. Yes, of course, many of these stories are nothing more than stories with a little more than just newspaper clippings, anecdotal evidence, hearsay, second, third-hand encounters, but there are quite a few retrievals and I'd say well over a dozen that have very viable paper trails to pursue. A lot of these I have covered before and will continue to cover. A lot of them need a lot more research done, but yes, there are numerous cases and this really is excluding places like China and Russia, the former Soviet Union. So to access those files and the alleged case or crash retrievals that have occurred there, that is something I want to do. Okay, sorry, trying to get through these guys because then we'll get to the UAPDA. I'm sorry, I will try to answer everything. Do you watch Angry Astronaut? Interesting UFO footage. No, I need to check that out. I mentioned a couple of times, guys. It's a little tough to keep up with footage just because there's so much footage and you can really debate endlessly and go down rabbit holes of footage. So no, I have not, but I will make some time to do so. Soon you're going to have to shut questions off and riff. Yes, we'll get through these and then we will because I got like a, I think like 15 tabs up on Chrome I want to go through. Ecology brings up some cases. View these, all great cases. 1989 Kalahari, that's what we're going to talk about soon. That is a bit of a controversial case as well as the South Africa 1996 case that was mentioned by Stringfield. Good cases. Scallions, thank you so much. I really appreciate your support. Thank you very much. Lou Elizondo keep constantly saying that's like finding a 747 in King Tut's tomb has me wondering if he's hinting at finding something in Egypt quite possibly. And I like the analogy of handing the nuclear device to people in Victorian era as well in terms of the strangeness of this technology. Don't you think it's interesting how figures like Elizondo and Grush have acknowledged we've made crash UAPs and are reverse engineering them but won't say how much progress we've made? Yes, absolutely. And as far as I know, I don't think Grush specifically is touched on the concept of ARV or successful reverse engineering at all. The extent that I've heard is of course from public sources is that little progress has been made in some instances, but this could be isolated to various defense contractors or programs. I think it's not too far out of the question to say that this program similar to the Manhattan Project is highly compartmentalized. There's probably various aspects of the program. Various defense contractors are probably not sharing their data between themselves. So yes, sorry, enjoying the cold brew here. Cold brew. Sorry guys, I can't speak today. Speaking of Menzel, Colthart has recently interviewed physicist Beatrice Vareal, Ville Vareal of the top 100 in the world who alleges Menzel destroyed some of the astronomical plates at Harvard. Yes, this is true. This is called the Menzel Gap. And there's another astronomer who has talked about this. This is called the Menzel Gap where much photos of kind of earth skies were basically destroyed by Menzel. Menzel Gap. Very, very cool. Yes, including the Washington flap that was 1952, specifically UFOs over Washington DC, which led to a CIA sponsored press conference by General John A. Sanford and Roger Raimi to dispel interest in UFOs. Virginia is the most famous crash retrieval case. It has details that James Fox didn't cover in the film, such as the death of animals in the zoo where the NHI was cited. I've heard that as well. Of course, James Fox probably couldn't get to everything, but he did a tremendous job with Moment of Contact. What do I think about Patrick Jackson's theory? Gary Nolan just talked about it. If anybody doesn't know Patrick Jackson, he focuses on spheres, orbs of UAP. The crux of his argument is that spheres generally travel in groups of three almost in a triangular shape where I don't know the full basis of a theory, but basically the three spheres work in conjunction to navigate and participate in the space around it. I think Patrick Jackson has a lot of images to back up his theories. I've never sat down and really dove through everything, but of course, I think I've referenced some of the images and orb photos he's used before because they're so dang interesting. There are claims, yes, Kabul, Afghanistan. I think this is 86. There's a Moondust file on this as well, but there's also stories of, I can't remember where I've heard it, but of an Afghan embassy, or maybe this was an Iraqi embassy being built near a UFO, or over a recovered UAP. Dead Fish Cheese Brez said, I saw a UFO 100 feet over me on January 10th, 23. I filed a MUFON report, number 127890. It was shot down over Alaska on February 9th, 23. Pentagon. Oh, did you witness the Alaska shootdowns or the craft that led to this? I'd love to hear more about this, man. If you could give me some information on what altitude the craft was flying at shape, see if any of the five UAP observables made sense to you, no visible signs of propulsion, and so forth. I'd love to hear about it. Stories about Mercury, yeah. I think this involved early stages of electrogravity, like rotating plates that contain Mercury. I think I'm trying to use my head right now. Was anti-gravity research shut down? Was physics misled? I don't think it was shut down. I'm going to be talking to Ryan Wood and Michael Schrat, if I can swing it. I know you'll like this, Kai. Ryan Wood thinks the concepts behind anti-gravity were really mastered in the 50s, and this is when ARV and reverse engineered craft were really put into practice. Michael Schrat thinks the 60s was this time that anti-gravity was mastered, and reverse engineering vehicles were put into practice. I'm going to have both of them on. We're going to talk about these topics, and that is going to be a heck of a lot of fun, and I cannot wait. Michael, you are awesome, brother. Thank you very much. Some of the radar data on the Washington Flaps still managed to survive. Yes, it did. Christian, thank you. I'm sorry, brother. Thank you very much. Any idea what this darker reality, Lou Elizondo, keeps hinting to what could possibly be so bad? Well, of course, there's the threat theories of invasion or the sober reality behind abduction and experimentation, if those are real. But these could be the darker reality. Lou and a lot of the TTSA crew really push the threat narrative a lot more than I'd say people like Grush do, and that is something I try to pay keen attention to. Have I seen any of the weird MH370 videos? Yes, I think most lives, there's a couple of questions about this. I'm staying clear of MH370 for now. I know that is a dang toxic sphere of research, and I got plenty, plenty to look at outside of that. Regicide and non. Hey, say less. I know regicide and non. I absolutely will. Keep doing what you do. Peyton Duke, thank you so much for the $10. I really appreciate it. Optv, we still believe despite no UAPDA. Yes, guys. Seriously, one minute, we'll talk about the UAPDA because I also am not crazy discouraged from the shootdown of it. Christian, thank you for the $2. I really appreciate that as well. Thank you so much. Kai, do you see footage of an ARV being tested over Groom Lake that was posted on the Discord? They took a picture of the craft and it kind of looked like a flux liner. Yes. There are, who posted in the Discord the TR3B folder as well? I need to look at that for some other alleged ARV vehicle constructions and videos, but yes, I have seen that Groom Lake video. What are your thoughts on the Reddit EBE posts? Is this the EBE that was associated with a Battelle Lab and where the molecular biologist really goes into detail of the anatomy of EBEs? I would like to talk about that, but I'm going to need a biologist on there for something. I'm well out of my depth and I might be able to read the summary and say, hey, this sounds great, but I really cannot offer any insights besides just saying this sounds interesting. So, dead fish, these were shot down over Alaska, Yukon and Lake Huron. Not a balloon. I saw one. What was the shape of these objects? I'm really interested to hear you say that. I got evidence of a clip I can send you of Jim Semavan saying NASA can't tell us the truth even if they wanted to because of a SAP and executive order. The clip isn't public. Unfortunately, it's Semavan. Please send that to me, uapgroom.gmail.com. I would love to watch that. Ross Goldhart had a Swedish astronomer who's also part of the Sol Foundation. She found potential evidence. Yes, I can't remember her name, but a trusted person who runs another YouTube channel, another content creator, passed along her information to me the other day. So, I'm actually going to talk to her. Edgar Fausch and Mark McCandlish. Yes, okay. Kai, I know you like Mark McCandlish and there will be a video on him probably in the very near future. I'm covering this because I have a little bit more to add to the story now of Mark. I've talked to a couple people about it, but we'll just say that the Mark McCandlish story got a little bit more interesting for myself in particular. Menzel Gap, first UFO debunker, yes. First UFO debunker, maybe because that happened in 52 and right before the realm of the Robertson panel and so forth, but probably. Was physics led down the false rabbit hole of string theory? I do not know. I know the debate over string theory, M theory and so forth, super string theory, but I'm not a physicist and physics was always my weak area. So, if I speak on string theory, I will probably sound like an idiot. Adam, thank you so much. I really appreciate your kind words, brother. Thank you. Yeah, okay. Dead fish. Tell us, brother. So, dead fish, if you've just joined, is talking about observing in 2023 in January. The objects that were allegedly shot down over Alaska and Lake Huron and so forth. I'm making a video about it, long story, but I saw it go from horizon to horizon directly over me a hundred feet up. It was going about 150 miles per hour, silent. It was a bright orange burning quartz crystal. Dead fish, if you make a video on this, please let us let this crew know. We will, I will point the community towards your video. We will support the heck out of it because that sounds fantastic and I cannot wait to see your research and thesis here. So, that anti-grab is his hus, is hus hus and to keep the mainstream from catching up. This is, this is, this is likely. There is also a really interesting realm of research around anti-gravity spawning out of Alabama. I know Ross Colthart, as well as Eric Weinstein has touched on this as well, but this sounds likely, yes. And especially in the 50s, there was so much work being done into anti-gravity research. Check out Jesse Michael's work, his video about tea towns and brown, as well as his recent project with a Nick Cook. They're fantastic. Dead fish, nobody, listen, nobody's doubting, doubting your credibility here. I think every single person in this chat is super interested to hear about your story. Super interested. Shout out to whoever mentioned Maje Brazil. Yes, absolutely. Crackerjack, thank you so much for the five dollars. I really appreciate that. You finished your masters in engineering. What realm? That congratulations. I don't know if I'm smart enough to get a master, so that truly means you are a smart cookie. That is awesome. If I had to take down an NHI brute, are we talking like a brute from Halo? The best mixed martial art move that would work for all types. Get a Tomahawk elbow in there, man. Get a Tomahawk elbow in there. I have a video and seven statements from other people. Okay, so yeah, dead fish, if you're creating a documentary on this, please let me know and I would love to have you on a live. Once you post this, we can talk about your video because that sounds absolutely phenomenal. I cannot wait. You also said you saw a bright orange upside down burning quartz crystal. Another person said it was a giant translucent craft. Now, this is very interesting. What do you think about how certain UAP encounters and hotspots in particular seem to be connected to other strange phenomenon like Bigfoot and Poltergeist? Jacques Filet has talked about this. Yeah, like the more high strangeness of UAP, hitchhiker effect and so forth. There's a podcast I love. It's a couple of Australian guys. It's called Mysterious Universe, if you guys have ever talked about this, and they talk about high strangeness involved with UFOs, especially in regards to skinwalker ranch. So I talk about this all the time, stuff like psionics is I'm really trying to get comfortable with this and UAP and high strangeness is even more uncomfortable for me. So I got to move really slow when it comes to like UAP, the hitchhiker effect, Lou talking about green orbs and other strange stuff, some of the skinwalker ranch stuff because I'm just so out of my dang element. So out of my element. See, fish, you got some you got some support in here, man. You got some support. Okay, guys, let me answer this last. Hold on, let's see this. Do you know Chris Mellon was highly involved in the Stargate program in 95 once it got moved to the Senate? Seems like people think he just recently got I had no idea he was involved in Stargate. Do you have any documents or something touching on this because I would very much like to see that. History buff. If you went to med school, yeah, let's either hop in the discord or shoot me an email at uapgurvegmail.com because I would love to kind of get your thoughts on that. Okay, we will go through these guys. Lou has alluded to religion and spirituality many times. Yes, he has. If there is a classified document on religion just to see how he reacts, I'm not allowed to talk about that. If I do get to talk to Lou, which I've I've hoped I've been able to, but I haven't got a chance to yet. Absolutely. Fat rodents. Thank you so much for the $10. I really appreciate that. Really appreciate that. How about the JFK and UAP connection JFK MJ12? I'd say it's the big ticket item. There is a I think one of the really interesting things to me is that Reuben Efron, the case manager assigned to intercept Lee Harvey Oswald's mail in I think 1955 or a little bit after also had registered UAP sightings while on train with other officials throughout the Soviet Union. There's just a lot of really interesting connections with JFK and UAP, especially MJ12. Given the Virginia incident, I don't think I'm getting close. I don't think getting close will work. Yes. If you if anybody's not familiar with the Virginia incident, according to the story one, I think it was a local police officer actually physically touched the the bean that came from the craft. This bean was super slick, super slimy, wreaked of ammonia and actually died of a very mysterious death very soon after. The mysterious universe is awesome. Yes, it is. Aaron Wright, Benjamin Grundy are two hilarious Aussies. Okay, guys, we are let's move on to talking about the UAP DA favorite all time UAP case. Uh, geez, I don't know if I have a favorite case. Probably my favorite crash retrieval is Kecksburg. I love that story, but I also love Kingman as well. And I also there's just I don't know if I have a favorite man. There's there's too many. There's too many. But okay, guys, let me pull up. I'm going to share my screen in a second here. And we will get on to some of this stuff. Let me figure out how to present, present share screen. Okay, entire screen. Okay, so as everybody knows, if you have been, oh, let me let me answer this from Kyle, a super chat man, 20 bucks. That's incredible. Thank you so much. Have I looked into the Tianjin airport sighting in China? No coverage on this very briefly, very briefly, but I would like to look a little bit more about how UAP sightings over the airport kind of shut down airport operations. We'll look into that more. So as we know, first posted, I'm shown a post by Matt from the Good Trouble show, the UAP DA to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2025 was shot down. This was done by primarily Senator Rand Paul and so forth and only three parts of the actual UAP DA made it into the actual, I think this was not for the National Defense Authorization Act this year for 2025, but the Intelligence Defense Authorization Act or something similar. Because here we can see these three aspects of the bill that actually made it into the, we'll check in a second, I can't remember if it's the defense or intelligence. But we have Comptroller General of the United States review of all domain anomaly resolution office. We have sunset of requirements relating to audits of unidentified anomalous phenomena, historical record reports, sunset is just kind of like the closing of and section 1003 funding limitations relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. I think in this post as well as others people are talking about how this might be the one positive thing to come from this, the funding limitations, but we need to remember that program activities, reverse engineering, crash retrieval, these are are likely kept deep hidden deep within USAPs to the point the they can avoid audit purposes and audit findings and reshift reshift under SAPOC if needed. So I don't think funding limitations as seen with Congressional oversight will have any effect on program activities. So these are the three parts that made it through okay into the Intelligence Authorization Act for 2025. So if you guys have heard of the site open secret, you can actually find lobbyists and so forth for bills and for various pieces of legislation. So as we saw with the three pieces of UAP materials that made it into the S.4443, I'll just call it 43 from now on, there was one company, a defense contractor in particular that specifically filed issue reports with this with Title X. Can anybody guess what that is? That is, you're probably going to be right if you guess, but you can also see the tab. So that's going to, I might as well just go into it. Battelle, now if you've followed my channel before, you know we've talked about Battelle, we've talked about the possibilities, possible study of meta materials under Battelle dating back to the 1940s. Here with Title X, we see that Battelle itself had issues relating to microelectronics and device cyber protection. That microelectronics statement is extremely, is a big standout to me, but also we can look for other lobbying with it filing issue reports and objections to the Intelligence Authorization Act. We see BAE systems. If you've known you, BAE systems, this was the contractor that if, so if you know some of the lore from the channel and stuff I've covered, you will remember BAE systems from the story of a three star general who allegedly showed classified reverse engineer technology to a BAE systems employee in 2003 or 2004. Battelle Memorial Institute, Lado Sink, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, University of California Princeton. So some universities as well, but these are some of the usual suspects we'd expect to see, especially about legislation that may have effect on private industry and UAP. Now, if anybody knows Christopher Sharp, which I'm sure many of you do of the Liberation Times, he wrote an excellent piece on this. This came out September 20th, 2024. So just the other day, if anybody read this article, there might be something that stands out too about this, but I'm going to read it. Okay, I'll read it word for word, maybe not word for word, but we'll go kind of quick. So actually, I'm not going to read it word for word, because that'll take too long. But in this article, Chris Sharp talks about the UAPDA being shut down. This was introduced by Senators Mike Rounds, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. I'm sure most of you have heard of this legislation will know it as the Schumer Amendment, including the 2024 and the 2025 UAPDA for the NDAA and Intelligence Authorization Act, and so forth. I would really recommend reading this article, but things get a little interesting here. Chris Sharp states, we'll actually go up a little bit. So if passed, the UAPDA could have unleashed a process revealing that the US government and defense contractors possess retrieved craft, which are according to the act capable of transmedium travel, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic speeds, and positive lift. List of the five observable or list of some of the observables of UAP craft is outlined by Lou Elizondo, five now six famously, if you include cognitive effects. Liberation Times has learned that the CIA currently facing mounting criticism over alleged dishonesty regarding anomalous health incidents Havana syndrome, if anybody doesn't know, along with the Department of Defense and Department of Energy has consistently bypassed democratic oversight and retrieving advanced objects of unknown origins. According to Liberation Times, these materials are subsequently sent to national labs and select defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin. So all stuff that's really great to see in writing, right? But nothing new here. Of course, the CIA, this is in reference to the OGA, Chris Sharp is the person that wrote the Daily Mail article about the OGA and JSOC recovery teams. Reading on, we read a little bit more about the UAPDA, but this article came out in I want to focus specifically right here guys, specifically right here. This article came out September 20. It is now September 22. Holy crap. Two cents. That is insane. Thank you so much. That is unbelievable. And I will eat so much to pull. Thank you so much for this. I really appreciate that. Thank you. And Teddy, I'm also from Cincinnati. So thank you, man. Greetings to you. But thank you again, two cents. So this article was put out September 20. It's September 22. There has been a massive revision to this article, a massive revision, because I've read through this today, preparing for this live. And there was a specific mention of a specific organization that wasn't present in this article. And I was flabbergasted because reading through this when it came out, you know, I saved the file just because I was worried something like this would happen and so forth. So but thankfully, other people have talked about this on or have saved this link on the web archive from its original posting, guys. So let's go to let's go to the original post here, guys. And let's reread. This is the original article that came out on the 20th by Chris Sharp. All of this is public information. I'm not revealing anything on previously unknown. Multiple programs are understood to be orchestrated by the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations, including its maritime branch alongside components of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, US Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, Space Command, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and Joint Special Operations. According to Liberation Times, missions carried out by these programs include the retrieval of objects beneath the oceans, including the CIA's Directorate of Operations, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office coordinated between the CIA and US Navy, United States Special Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanic Institute Oceanographic Institution. Now this seems like an insane redaction from the original article, doesn't it? The original article mentioned CIA doesn't mention CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology. It doesn't mention the NRO and OGA. I mean, sorry, the NRO and NGA, the two offices David Grush worked for and was as liaison to the UAP Task Force, and it sure as heck doesn't mention the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office or the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. If you guys have watched my lives before, remember, I shouted out one of my buddies, Max Parr, who donated it to the channel and asked if I had done much research into the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office. A little bit behind the scenes I had, but I was shocked to see this posted by Chris Sharp. Now look at the end there, guys. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Now there is a very tasty treat of research we can go down here. So one, I can't remember the gentleman who was talking about forgotten languages. Forgotten languages has its own post about NRO, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office. This, for anybody who doesn't know, Forgotten languages is like a really strange encrypted website that has really spoken about a lot of UAP stuff, whether it's a LARP, whether it's not, but this was mentioned a lot in the UAP timeline, a collection of links and so forth that was sent to Congress before the 2023 hearings. This is what that article looks like if nobody's read it. It's a fantastic piece. I reference this with all of my cases, but Forgotten languages is an anonymous site in the public domain and it's like an encrypted site, but that's not what I want to talk about. The National Underwater Reconnaissance Office is developed for the U.S. Air Force in CIA to manage satellite reconnaissance and it's often known as the hidden brother of the actual NRO. But let's talk about the Woods Hole, or I'll just call it Woods Hole from now on. So Woods Hole, its mission statement is Woods Hole is dedicated to advancing knowledge of the ocean and its connection with the earth system through a sustained commitment to excellence in science, engineering, and education. Pretty standard, right? Who we are, what we do, vision and mission statements, they probably have some federal grants and so forth. My computer keeps giving me notifications. Let me turn off my secondary speaker. Sorry, guys. If you can still hear me. Yeah, okay. So I had no idea NRO even existed. Most people do not. It's not very well publicized and we will probably see why after here. So if you guys remember my Offworld Technologies Division video, the certain location that was spoken about much work was done with that and it's a fellow contractor, SAIC, Science Applications Center National Corporation, by analyzing contracts and grants to the contractor. So WHO Woods Hole has received quite a bit in federal grants and federal awards since its inception. Since 2001, there has been a total of $3.3 billion awarded. Many of these, IDIQ indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, IDV indefinite delivery vehicles, IDC indefinite delivery contract and so forth. But there are a few of massive interest here to me at least. This contract in particular between Woods Hole and the Office of Naval Research for O&amp;I. This was for communications, navigation and unmanned vehicles for Arctic operations. Now, if you haven't heard of O&amp;R, I've talked about it a few times. Many ufologists and researchers have talked about it a few times. I think I talked about O&amp;R specifically in relation to a paper it wrote on psionic research in 2008 to 2012 and the validity of psionic research. So this is just one contract that Woods Hole has with Navy. There's also contracts, one of its largest contract vehicles, for $794 million over the span of nine years was with the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. Now, if you guys have watched the Off-World Technologies Division, I talked about a sister facility, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, the sister facility here to this location in Newport, Rhode Island. This project was to procure hardware, materials, and supplies as well as services to develop, build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support the unmanned undersea vehicle, UUV, for family of systems. So remember what Chris Sharp wrote about here, that the Woods Hole, in particular, along with Nuro, is used to retrieve underwater crash retrievals. And actually, just so we can see, over in the DPI archives, there's a great... I'm going to put this graphic up when we talk about underwater retrievals. It's a great graphic. Just from Greer, I have no idea in what relation this case is to. I've tried to figure it out. You know how Greer's files work if you've ever been on the DPI archive, but just a nice thing to look at here. So we can go further. So the National Undersea Warfare Center, just like I said, the sister facility to the Surface Warfare Center. This is in Rhode Island, not too far from the location I spoke about. But we can look at other contracts with Woods Hole. Here is a contract with NSWC Crane. And you know what contractor it's with? SAIC. I had zero idea this existed or that Woods Hole had contracts with SAIC. SAIC, if you've never seen the video in the Off-World Technologies Division, I studied it. I went through the testimony of a whistleblower in an interview that stated that Off-World Technologies was being studied here, were being studied here in a division called the Off-World Technologies Division, with a present contractor after much abundant research. Myself and my friend Kermit had determined that this was SAIC, Science Applications and International Corporation. This specific project, it seems like a very small amount of money. What was for research and development of expeditionary weapon systems for Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Weapon Systems Division, JXN, and program executive office unmanned and small combatants. Now, remember what we talked about in the Off-World Technologies Division, why the specific I spoke about was there to test experimental conventional weaponry, where he was taken to the Off-World Technologies Division, where one piece of technology was guessed to be a weapon due to an electric discharge during recovery. I find it very interesting of the mention of expeditionary weapon systems here, but this goes even further, guys. There's more contracts here with tons of contracts with NSWC Crane, with the Navy, with the Air Force, and so forth. But let's look at this specific contract for engineering services, National Defense R&amp;D Services, Department of Defense Military, Experimental Development. I found this piece, the most interesting or fishy here. This IDC indefinite delivery contract was awarded sole source to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute because the government believes that the supplier has unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained. Now, what I mentioned there, the Woods Hole is the only kind of non-profit organization because Woods Hole is a non-profit, federally funded institution that has any sort of submersible or these kind of R&amp;D capabilities. I wanted to introduce you guys to this statement by Chris Sharpe that was edited out of this article, as well as Woods Hole, because I am doing a massive research project on this. It's not next video, but I'm doing so much research on this and the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office. This mention by Chris Sharpe was shocking to me of a specific mention in this specific non-profit for undersea crash retrieval operations. And then to see that this company, this non-profit, has ties with NSWC Crane, with the Underwater Weapon Center, and so forth, was really shocking to me. So I wanted to talk about that a little bit. There's going to be a lot more research done there. But if you guys found that interesting, that Chris Sharpe article in the mention of the UAPDA, I have not seen anybody talking about that particular omission from his, from his, nobody connects the dots better. People do do it better. If you guys see on lives, I struggle very much to speak. I trip over my tongue because I'm trying to think of so much stuff so fast. But so this is going to be a kind of a main line of research for myself. And if I can find any similar witnesses, whistleblowers to talk about this, you guys know I will. So I hope everybody found that interesting. Next, I wanted to talk a little bit about, and if for anybody who's kind of in the discord or something, I'll post all of this stuff. I'll put an invite here if you guys want, but I usually put all my research files in there. So just a good place to talk if you want to review the research files. So next, there was a pretty interesting Reddit post yesterday I kind of want to talk about now, that I'm sure a lot of you guys saw this. It actually blew up a little more than I thought. Sorry, guys. And it says, Hello, everyone. I made my dad a promise when he passed away last week. He worked for the Pentagon from the 60s to 80s. Now, if you guys don't know, this is another long, so before I get to that, yeah, huge loss with the UAPDA, but still have hope, my friend. I'm of the mind where I think that our best result is going to be with a little bit more catastrophic disclosure. I do not think we're going to get much, even if the UAPDA passes. Remember, there's an executive order program that was created under Obama that automatically factors things of nonhuman intelligence. This could also be AI to be automatically devoid of any sort of declassification. And it would take an equal and opposite executive order to remove this sort of mandatory non declassification standard. So I never really had high hopes for the UAPDA. Anyways, there was always going to be the struggle of eminent domain. And at some point, it was probably going to get shot down again. The encouraging thing is that, of course, the UAPDA has been killed, but we still have our hearings coming up in November. Sorry, I was looking at talent. You've tried contacting all the main UFO channels and email and chat, all of them completely ignored. What is fake, man? Let me know what's going on. What is going on here, bro? I'd like to hear about this. But so let's talk about this Reddit post. And we'll check in with you, Tal, and see what you're saying, because I just wanted to talk about this a little bit. This isn't a long line of another Reddit 4chan whistleblowers who have made some strong statements, deleted their accounts, or kind of gone AWOL afterwards. The famous one is the 4chan whistleblower that came out in 2023 who talked about the large hamburger 3D printing facility under water and kind of the ORBs, the UAP ORBs really being hammers. Just something interesting I want to talk about. This is the newest and the latest of long lines. I do plan to do full breakdowns on the last person I talked about who talked about the acorn shaped craft being on a sort of gyroscope inspector and so forth, and the 4chan whistleblower. But this, I'm going to read through this, and then I have another one of these kind of anonymous sources that relates this a little bit. Okay, remarkable job, 6468. And I will be trying to contact this individual who says, I'm really nervous, scared, and not sure what to write, but I'll do what I can. I don't expect anybody to believe me, but I made my dad a promise. He worked in the government and told me he was in the more secretive side. He said that he worked with NASA from the Pentagon closely from the 60s to the early 80s. Closely, very, very closely. He didn't tell me much on his deathbed other than what I'll put below. He died from pancreatic cancer and didn't care anymore about hiding things. I wanted to post this earlier, but I was really afraid. I don't even know if this will be accepted or deleted or if anyone will believe me, but I'm keeping a promise. My dad told me that the mood landings are definitely real. I already know there's going to be controversy there, but there's more to it. He told me the race of the moon was an invitation by aliens who watch Earth. That's why both of the Soviets and Americans were so crazy to reach it. He told me he saw pictures that the public won't get to see and remembers it like yesterday. Pillars clustered together in the background in pyramid-like structures. Neil was giving a wide map of Earth as a gift to a creature that was half his size. Neil, so Neil Armstrong, was giving a wide map of Earth as a gift to a creature half his size. He told me the astronauts were not told about this until the very last moment for security reasons. He told me the invitation was a test of humanity's capabilities and that the first country to reach them would be partners with them. I always knew my dad as I grew up was a big shot, but this was just too much. He told me he didn't think they would come after me, but he said a dead man switch with someone if something happens to me because of this post. I don't know what else to say really. I'm so anxious I want to puke, but I want to see those pictures badly. Like I said, I don't expect anybody to believe me, my dad, believe my dad or me, but I kept my promise he was really hopeful the last five years before he died that things would be out there, but he has been mad at the government and told me he doesn't care anymore. Anyways, I hope you all have a good day. Also, why did they remove the content of my post but not lock it? They didn't even give me a reason. Of course, that's super interesting to read. I have a little problem with the operational security of this line here, not telling astronauts until the last very moment about possible sightings of creatures of non-human intelligence that doesn't seem very... Oh, actually, this was posted in Aliens. If this was cross posted in UFOs, I actually asked Joey, it's not my name, who's a mod there. What the heck happened if that was removed? But that seems like terrible operational security, right? Not to tell these astronauts who may have severe anxiety or panic attack upon. We need a creature half their size that's of non-human intelligence. Now, this person right here, according to their dad, this isn't the first testimony of individuals who state there's video or pictures of non-human intelligence or UAP either en route to two or back from the moon or on the moon itself. I know I've talked about an individual in the hidden within the Greer research files. There's also astronauts who have made outstanding comments on astronauts who have made outstanding comments on NHIs such as Gordon Cooper and of course, Buzz Aldrin. I found this interesting in particular, not by itself, but because this reminded me back from June of another 4chan whistleblower, right? And this reads a little bit to me like a lark. Of course, all of this could be... This reads a little bit like a lark just of all the details. But this person talks about a program at 18 where he was utilized on such as Gary McKinnon's non-terrestrial officer sent to the moon where there are pyramids that when he got close to said pyramids, they kind of messed with human cognition similar to other stories of getting in contact with the UAP itself. This could be drawn to stuff like the witness I covered RA or possibly the infographics whistleblower and so forth. So I would call BS just on the comment about the dead man switch requires user interaction to verify they're still alive. Yeah, this post, the reason I wanted to talk about it was just because it reminded me closely of this accountant. I like talking about these statements. I think there are some that probably have more validity than others. If you guys read the one and I think it occurred in July, it was about a person in the 24th STS, which is a special forces unit in JSOC that stated their captain was kind of sent away to mysterious operations. And at one point he talked that he kind of was on the case of the retrieval of a craft that really shook him to the core. So there's some that are more believable than others. Generally, I find the more detail added, the more they are a little hard to believe. That's why the statement about the astronauts not being told into the last second and possibly the dead man switch is a little bit a little bit more as maybe a little bit too much icing to the story, as well as this case right here. But this individual, there's there's six shots. There's six shots of this. And I will post this in the discord as well. If you guys want to talk about it more, because I don't want to just read through the whole thing, right? There's so much. But the gist of it is this person is sent in like a non terrestrial officers to the moon. I think under the moon surface, there's large caverns according to this person, which are pyramid structures, as people get close to them, their cognition suffers and so forth. I think I think this individual doesn't talk about seeing beans, but recalls echoes and sounds in these caverns that likely were not made by by humans. So if you guys want to at some point read through the whole thing, we can, but I won't do that now. Let me look through some of these real fast. Check your email. I sent you a fascinating Reddit post from last year that has since been removed. I saved, oh, from the molecular biologists. I think you're talking about the EBE. Somebody was talking about that earlier. I think they stated this, this study was done out of a Battelle laboratory near an army base, if any of you guys know specifically which which base. That's a really interesting story. I know there's been a lot of back and forth on that encounter. Again, I said I would talk to a biologist just because I'm, I know next and nothing about biology. Thanks for pointing out the EO. I appreciate that, man. Good look at the data, rather than just dismiss stuff because it doesn't fit your bias. There are things taken more seriously. Yes, that's a, that's a great point up. Yeah, I might have a picture in my head of how I think things work or what stories are true or not, but I still try and analyze almost any story I can, even if things don't necessarily like scream true to me at first. I still think they're worth checking out. Details of stories as well as kind of cross referencing to other cases. Let me get a invite to the server here. Let me get an invite to the server. All you've got to do is watch the press conference with the astronauts once they returned from the moon. They weren't happy. They were in shock. I've seen that as well. I think it was, there was an individual in my discord who was talking about this and he was saying that this clip is often used. The astronauts seem very kind of distant. They seem dissociative from their current events. This could be because they encountered something or just because they were so kind of shot from the mission at hand. I'm not really sure. I haven't seen the, the, the video in a while, but that of course is referenced quite a bit when people talked about, you know, especially the Apollo 11 crew discovering strange things on the moon. And I think a bunch of people have asked me about this before. There's of course Stephen Greer's whistleblower controversial. And I think I've talked about him just referenced his name, Carl Wolf, who states that Wolf, sorry, that states there have been photos and images of things on the moon. There are also multiple entries in Greer's DPI, their, his witness list in the DPA archive. I think there's almost half a dozen of, of entries that state they saw photos of structures and so forth on the moon. And then you have guys like Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11 astronaut, who I, does he still, does anybody know if he still talks about the Phobos monolith? Phobos, a kind of a moon of Mars where there's a supposed monolith that Buzz Aldrin had talked about quite a bit. What do you think about the alien biology reddit post? We'll talk about that once I can get some biology under my belt. I think with, I think I would, we'll probably talk about this specific one here with the moon in discord and we'll just kind of get things running. We don't need to get too involved in that here just because I don't think there's much connection to ufology at a wider scale besides maybe the integration of a non terrestrial officers list if it involves Gary McKinnon's case. I want to cover the four chin whistleblower that talks mainly about the under sea self replicating facility. The person I talked about in the Kecksburg video, the 24th STS guy and the might and the biologist. If I can get somebody who understands biology and can actually help me out because okay, this was in Fort Detrick. Okay. Yes. Okay. Fort Detrick, Maryland. I think it's an army base and I think it's by Raven Rock, which is a huge underground facility. If I'm not mistaken, anybody know where I can find the 2023 Greer timeline, UAP timeline? Are you talking about the timeline that was given to Congress? I can send a link. If anybody has a, I don't know how to send you a link either connect with me on email or come to the discord because that should be posted there. Sorry, I'll get through the Battels National Biodefense Lab. Yes. And we know from Vitell, they are direct. Oh, wrong one. Sorry. They are directly lobbying against the UAPDA. So Vitell is always a customer of interest. Real quickly, I like this question. I know it's a little bit outside of what we're talking about right now. What two piece of advice would you give to a new BJJ student BJJ? If you guys don't know is Brazilian jiu-jitsu. This is my jam when I'm not doing research or doing any sort of Tom Flurry. I'm trading jiu-jitsu. If you are a brand new white belt starting off, I would really focus on conserving energy, knowing when to apply pressure versus knowing when to back off. It is a, I can't tell you how many new guys will, you'll get them in a good position side control, take their back, even something like get them in your close guard and they will score them and you can feel them shaking their muscles are contracting so bad, you will gas out incredibly quickly. So just focus on relaxing and applying strength and technique only when needed. A lot of jiu-jitsu is about conserving energy, not applying it. Number two, start to find, start to start working on your guard game early. You got to have a good guard. If you want to smash, you got to be able to prevent the pass. That is what I would say. Oh, sorry, I'll get to that in a second. Talon, what are you guys are talking about? I think in the comments about Las Vegas. If some, if you guys are talking about that, fill me in. King of NHI and BJG, no man, I'm just a purple belt in jiu-jitsu. One day, one day we'll get the black belt, one day. Is it challenging? No, I'm in charge of neither guys. I am not in possession of classified information on an HI. I just do research. I would very much like to be able to have more information and I get smashed by black belts all the time. That Battelle Lab Post talks about the alien religion again. Is that a sigh up or can they not disclose because of Cosmic Core that we can't comprehend? This is the, the Battelle Lab Post is the biologist post, the Reddit whistleblower. I think, am I right in saying that in that post, I'm just trying to reference off the top of my head. This supposed individual references NHI religion in terms of kind of like a karmic outlook where these beings kind of focus on their output of intentions into the universe and so forth and kind of what comes back. I'm trying to remember off the top of my head. I haven't read that in a good bit. Do you think of the recent Diddy allegations and indictments being released at the same time when this topic of, I don't, probably not with, I don't think the subject of, I think the stigma, I don't think Diddy and all this has anything to do with UAP. I think the stigma does a dang fine job in not having people care about this. I'd still recommend trying to talk to the average person in your life about UAP and NHI. I guarantee most of people would, will laugh at you and say, nope, probably reference little green men. And then that's when you start discussing facts and then they will back up. Connor, no, I had an open mind on UAP since I, since the day I could read. This has always been kind of my top subject. When I was growing up, part of the reason I went into engineering was I always had some little bit of fever dream in my head that I could work on reverse engineering technology just because I was so fascinated in particularly Bob Lazar growing up. So yep. So I'll put this down and then we'll talk a little bit more about, we'll just do another little bit more questions right now. If you guys want to talk about stuff, do some more Q&amp;A for the 10K stuff. The stuff I talked about with the neuro and sorry, and the kind of Woods Hole and so forth. This is a line of research I'm working on right now. This is pretty new to me. Of course, the article came out two days ago and Chris Shark does fantastic work. I can see why this portion of the article was removed. Remember, guys, I'm not putting out any classified names or locations or anything. This was all public. This is all public information I'm talking about, but I think there's a lot of really interesting research avenues there. We focused on NSWC. Now we can focus on NUWC. We can focus on all sorts of these underwater crash retrievals, which I think is a huge overlooked aspect of crash retrieval. You can talk about 1964 Shag Harbor. I scour the career archives every single day. If I can find out in what way this article, sorry, if I can find out what that piece of the undersea triangle is referencing, if that's a case, if that's a whistleblower who has spoken to Greer, I will try to do that as quick as possible because I'm fascinated. Ortle Chow, thank you so much for the 10 bucks. I really appreciate it. I will continue to keep doing this. This is my passion. Talking with you guys, as I know it's so many of yours. That's why I'm very honored and just thankful to have everybody here. There's so many people in this, the chat all the time and in the Discord. I want to shout out to Kai and Rectified in particular for always having receipts, documents, and so forth to talk about. Kai, if you're still in here, we will talk about Mark McCandlish as well very soon because if you're still here and want to know, I will talk to you about the new developments in the case, but there's some really interesting stuff. Talon, yes. My name's just Gerb in there. You can find me anywhere and anywhere as Gerb. Sorry. Okay, some theme or someone. I used to dismiss Herrera due to the helicopter debunk. I softened up to him once. Joey explained why the insider actually did take him to the facility. Yeah, the helicopter photo is still probably one of the most contentious pieces around Michael. Many people, including myself, believe that this was actually an individual named Ethan Dorian. Now, Ethan is not available for comment. Joey has tried to reach out to this individual as well and talk to him. I believe it was Ethan. He had an accident. I think it gave him brain damage. It was just a random accident. I think it was with livestock or something, but this is what myself and others believe. Of course, the issue with the camo match. There are aspects of the camo that match up, but there are other aspects of the camo that don't seemingly match up perfect. That's one of the biggest arguments against Michael. Of course, just with the amount of content I've made on Michael, I think you guys know I'm much more interested in this case and I do plan on probably having Michael on again in the future. I think he even mentioned once he might be, because Michael and I both live in Colorado. Maybe we'll link up to a live stream. I think that'd be a lot of fun to answer questions live with him. I'd love to do that, but The Insider was another fantastical and hard to believe detail. Yes, I completely understand as well when people talk about just the difficulty in believing about The Insider, especially with the book like Sentinels of Ether and so forth. A lot of people like to brush that off. This trick on Dobser that's so unlikely when there's books like Secret Machines, there's in Jesse Michael's new video with Nick Cook. Names are escaping me right now, but there was another kind of rocket scientist and anti-gravity researcher that wrote another fiction on flying saucers. Actually, Kai, if you're in here in ARVs in the 60s, it's super interesting as well. There is a lot more to that Michael's Insider story that I hope one day this individual comes forward. That's what I hope and pray almost every single day. I would love that more than anything because his testimony could be extremely powerful. In Nova Scotian, and now thanks for everything you do. Love and peace. Thank you, man. Yeah, the Shag Harbor story. That's a fantastic, fantastic case. I've heard from Justin Bush and Abduk T and former Marine Corps that digital camouflage uniforms have actually matching patterns and some of his did. Justin Bush is interesting. I'm part of a group that he just joined. I'd like to I'd like to talk to him a little bit because he is a really interesting abduction case and I know you guys know I've never really dipped my toes into abduction and so forth. This could be a good opportunity to talk firsthand with somebody. What do you make of the large underwater structure near Catalina Island coastal area disappearing off Google Maps relatively recently? Yes, I think that's been posted by Timothy Gallaudet, too, of like a almost censored Google Maps piece. So I believe I've actually talked to Ryan Wood about this. He has kind of theorized that there might be two possible locations of interest of maybe underwater bases, maybe just hot spots of USO activity, one off Catalina Island, one off of Florida. I also know institutions like UAPX have been historically looking at Catalina Island in particular. So I think of any places to look, that's probably a really, really, really good place to look. If you'd like to vindicate Mike in that regard, yeah, so the camouflage you're referencing, yes, that is still an ongoing thing to talk about, absolutely. And we got Max Parr in here. Max Parr just shouted you out. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work, Herb. Sending support as always. Do you think we'll get any documents from Nuro in the upcoming UAPDA release in October? I would, I don't know. We might need to do some FOIA requests, especially Nuro projects or grants or awards with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute now. That might be the new line of research to pursue. Kermit may have told you about this, but I've been talking to him a little bit about the research today on kind of Nuro and Chris Sharpe's article. So he might have brought that up with you, but it's super, super, super interesting. Have you seen the Skinny Bob videos? I don't know. There's been so much, so much debate like about Skinny Bob. I don't really have an opinion here just because I don't really see an avenue to get to the bottom of this case. I think it's the same with John Stewart's Alien Interview. There's just a kind of endless discussion about it. I'll steer clear, there's plenty of research projects that I'm really passionate on that I think I can really kind of advance the conversation around. I'll stick to those. If there's a topic that I don't really think I can provide value on, I'll probably steer clear from. This was kind of my take with Kecksburg just because there had been so much done on it, but I really wanted to approach a few new angles kind of with Eric A. Walker with Johnson and so forth. But if I don't think I can add, I'll probably just wait, just wait. The guy to do a deep dive into Amy Eskridge that I would, I'll probably put her in a video alongside the likes of guys like James E. McDonald. Amy Eskridge was interested in anti-gravity research who was, I don't know if I can say the word on YouTube, but did pour things to herself. I think you get demonetized on YouTube for saying such things. But yes, Amy Eskridge is a really, really, really interesting case that deserves further research. I know a place in Outer Banks, North Carolina, what play? Oh, like a underwater hotspot. I would love to hear more. People used to dump huge amounts of toxic waste in the oceans out here by Cattle in the Island. I did not know that. Foya, the videos from the fighter objects, fighter jets that shot down the objects. Who knows if that Foya will even work it. I'm also trying to learn how to adeptly use Foya. Otherwise, I might just ask and wait 36 months just to get nothing like I know many people do. John Greenwald also gets frustrated with Foya requests and kind of gets played all the time. Will we get videos? I don't know. Absolutely don't know. The skinny Bob videos look like CGI. The movement looks like bad CGI. And then Starlinger is talking about the, the skinny Bob videos are more interesting at 1.25 speed. I haven't watched skinny Bob for a long time, so I really have no kind of valuable input right here. Max Barr, if you are a Foya person, Neuro is a high value target for underwater UAP reports. Similar to NRO, National Reconnaissance Office with fast walkers. It's the sister office focused on the ocean. Yeah, if you guys, I've talked about fast walkers before, if you guys don't know about this, these are objects, fast walkers and slow walkers entering or leaving earth's atmosphere. We talked quite a bit about that in relation to Bob Fish and so forth and DSP, the defense support program. And yes, Neuro, this is something I want everybody in here to keep research, research on. And Max, you're getting a shout out by Hicology. Amy Eskridge, yeah, not so sure if she did that to herself. Another person of interest that I will include there is Mark McCandlish. If you guys don't know, Mark McCandlish was found dead in 2021, historically from a self-inflicted wound. However, recent interviews dating back to like 2014, 2017 and so forth, Mark McCandlish spoke. He slept with a pistol under his pillow in fear of his life. In 2014 as well, there was a documentary made on Mark McCandlish called, I think it was called, Fluxliner and Zero Point Energy. This was made by a filmmaker named James Allen. Before the completion of the film, James Allen was diagnosed and dead with an extremely aggressive form of cancer within the span of a couple of weeks. In his autopsy, he was also found to have suffered from heavy metal poisoning. So a lot of weird deaths around that McCandlish story as well. So there has been a chemical dump near Catalina Island in the 40s when the nation's largest manufacturer of DDT began dumping waste into the water. I don't like to hear that. So talking about Skinny Bob, the movement looks more realistic and fluid at 1.25 speed, which appears matches the speed of the film they were shot on. Okay, yeah, I don't know about the kind of original film. If what kind of film was Skinny Bob shot on, I know that probably plays a huge role into analysis of the film. I just do not, not too, too familiar. Have you heard of the Chains of the Sea story by that Lou references about alien arrival, yet they're here to talk to other non human intelligence that exists on a deeper dimensional layer of reality on earth. I know that piece, it's a, it's a book that Lou references, but I have not read it. Chains of the Sea, I have it in a reading list, but no, I haven't, and I didn't even know what it was about. So that is very interesting. So Frank Milburn, I have heard of Frank Milburn, close friend of Amy Eskridge, that she was terrified before her ultimate demise, which we'll talk about guys, because that is something or someone has a great point here, bringing that up. Bart, any comment on Google and YouTube censoring regarding this topic? I know there's, there's Ross and Timothy Gallaudet have talked about Google Maps in particular, particularly censoring places like Catalina Island. I may be censoring, maybe just shadow banning and so forth or shadow hiding results. But also, you have to remember that the vast majority of the world populace and US populace still think that UAP is just a common conspiracy theory and there's not much to it. And the story of little green men is for crazy people to make up, which really infuriates me. Zach Brad Swanson from the Flexliner story should still be around. Yeah. Yes, not all I'm going to say there, if you're listening is yes. Yes. Catalina is also a point of operation for legit Coast Guard ops. I wouldn't think the blocking of Google images is more mundane, but I could be wrong. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I do think it's interesting that of all people, Timothy Gallaudet, if I'm remembering correctly, if I'm wrong, correct me, because I don't want to misquote, talked about this specifically. Max Parr, have I looked into the JDC two and the possibility of an accelerating UAP transparency, especially with the involvement of Carl Nell, someone going on the record soon, I have not heard of JDC two. Let me let. No, I have actually never heard of JDC two. If Carl Nell is talking and possibly somebody else going on records, the joint all domain command and control Department of Defense program that aims to connect military sensor and communications assets into a single network, the possibility of Nell speaking and somebody else, possibly a first hand person going on record, that isn't I would love to hear more about that. If you believe in angels and demons, you believe in aliens. So they kind of in reference to like the Collins elite that Lou Elizondo talks about some powerful DoD figures that revere UAP as demons and are somewhat terrified to look into the topic just due to religious reasons. What information is she hand talking about that's supposed to be coming on October 18th? I have not the faintest idea. I have not heard she hand talking about anything like that. I know he had an event last night somewhere in Santa Cruz, I think it was. I think it was just to talk, but I have not heard of it of him talking about specifically October 18th. Zach, we'll talk Brad Swaranson. I'm glad you bring that up because I kind of want to save that for a piece on the candle. I have to have some element of surprise. Terrible with withholding surprises, but that should be a fun piece of the video. Has anyone figured out what the symbol on the bottom of Lou Elizondo's cup was? He blatantly took a fake sip of the cup just before raising it to show the bottom. I've seen a lot of this talk about Lou's cup. Now, I've seen the video. Is it for sure a fake sip from his cup? Because I'm not sure what the symbol is. I know there's been a lot of analysis on this, but to me at least I couldn't see anything recognizable in that clip. So, Bart, you're saying the censoring is so bad. Searching your own YouTube watch histories hides the video. That's interesting. There has been, I think, a couple of people who have said they've been unsubscribed from the channel. Whether that's nefarious, I don't know. I won't make any accusations maybe, but I don't know. Hiding from your watch history, that is weird. So, October 18th, that UAP records are due to the National Archives. According to some folks, the file size is 1.3 terabytes. Yeah, Lester Nair has spoken about this. Some of these files are actually available. What, if there's any impactful files, we shall see. I know in the available files right now, a lot of them are files from Greer and so forth. So, I don't think there's a ton to go off on those. I don't have too high of hopes for National Archives files, but I'd love to be proved wrong. You know, the video is based when there's a Wikipedia disclaimer above the description. The thing is, I'm not even sure why Kecksburg, why there would even be, in the latest video, a disclaimer. I mean, the Kecksburg Wikipedia page just talks about the story and doesn't offer any of the conventional explanations. It even talks about the Cosmos 96 story being kind of refuted. And, you know, of course, there's stuff like that on other videos, but that in particular, why do I keep looking to my left? I got another monitor over here and I'm just looking at it to just ensure other stuff is going on good. I'm sorry, I'm not a crack and I promise, but I got another screen up there. So, I'm just, if I'm looking off to the side, it's just because there's another screen. It's nothing else interesting. Regarding Lou's interview, I've seen the full video and it's not as suspicious when you watch the full thing. He audibly sips multiple times, at least on the bottom of the mug. You know, a lot of the time price tags come on the bottom of the mug. I do see a world in which this was like a tag that just kind of got a bit mangled and wet and disheveled, but I have not kind of clued in on if this was a secret message or not. Have I had a chance to see the hundreds of pages of Canadian documents on the UAP shoot downs in Feb of 2023? No, but I have that on a list of stuff to look through. Deadfish in the comments earlier was talking about possibly witnessing this event in person and he's making a video on it where he's interviewed witnesses and so forth, including himself. So, I would really, really, really like to see that when it's done. Probably dead end, but have you looked into the alleged recordings of landings on military base, the Holloman landings? Yes, I have. And I will talk about that. Specifically, Gordon Cooper, this occurred in 1954. Gordon Cooper said he saw this film and it was recorded by his team, his team of surveyors on the site at Holloman Air Force Base, where a craft, I think it was a bit of a classic saucer design and I think, I can't remember if he discussed like landing gear and landing mechanisms here, but touchdown and departed. And there's also the famous story of Eisenhower and I think this was also in 1954 meeting and creating agreements with NHI too. That's of course a very famous story. The symbol on the bottom of Lou's cup is described as tape, but I'm sure that NSA could have a listening device as thin as that to plan on somebody if they're tracking. It would be funny if Lou found it. Absolutely. I mean, I'm sure he's probably being tracked in multiple ways. Absolutely. Wikipedia is totally compromised by guerrilla skeptics. Yes. What a, if anybody could remind me, what was the story of Mick West? I think he was either changing Wikipedia entries or his own Wikipedia bio was changed. If anybody could fill me on what that story was, I'd love to remember. There, of course, I've even talked about improved various edits of stuff being deleted, like in the Koyama case where there's no reason for deletion and also no sighting of sources by Wikipedia people. And it's very frustrating. Is there any reason to think that forgotten languages is not a LARP? It kind of seems like it may have been made by a crazy person posting nonstop for 15 years on encrypted format in an ARG of LARP. Any reason to, like any evidence I have off the top of my head or on hand to say it's not a LARP? No. But that requires a full investigation. Of course, it is very strange. And of course, at first glance and kind of looking through the encryption and so forth, it seems like a crazy mofo kind of worked on this page with the amount of encryption, the amount of strangeness and so forth. Radilio, that's a cute dog, by the way. What are your thoughts on Bob Lazar? So we talk about this, I'd say almost every video, I personally do not comment on Bob Lazar because I cannot separate my own biases away from the facts of the case. There are arguments for and against Bob Lazar. I want more than anything for his case to be true because it had quite an impact on my childhood. You can see the sports model behind me that Bob Lazar created. So I tend to stay away from Bob. I have positive things to say about him, my negative things to say about him. I hope more than anything that his case is true. But it did leave a bad taste in my mouth after the 2023 hearings when he said, I told you so without testifying. I didn't really like that. You familiar with the whole theory that these crash and landed UAP, we recover our gift to push our technological and cultural evolution in a particular direction? Absolutely, donation theory. This was talked about by Grush in the Ross Goldhart interview that many of these craft have been just kind of found left unattended in his own words. And this was also the crux of the story of third hand arrow whistleblower Eric Tabor who stated that his, I think it was great grandfather, great, great uncle at area 51 encountered and heard the story of an egg shaped craft that was found in the Nevada desert, just completely unattended and left alone. So yes, I the argument versus craft versus donation craft is one that I kind of often try and keep in mind during every crash retrieval video I make. I really want to hear more stories where some of these craft have supposedly been found just left unattended. Because I mean, if Grush specifically talked about this, he made a specific point to access that some of these craft are almost appeared to be gifted, that I think there's a lot of things worth checking out here. Good trouble did. Yeah, good trouble is great. Matt from the Good Trouble show. Yes. Are you talking about Wikipedia? Please. Any stories, cases that you initially dismissed as BS but came around to later post 2017. I'm a lot more open minded about this kind of thing. That's a good question. Geez, I'd say before probably the 1992 Long Island case, I initially just dismissed it as hearsay, but I think there's a lot of investigation that has been done that's worth discussing a lot more investigation that needs to be talked about that case. 1992 Long Island. Spent a lot of time researching the forgotten language. Oh, Matt Ford. Okay, so Matt Ford did an episode on this. So, Huckology. Yes, you did spend time on the Forgotten Languages website and the guy turned out to be a convicted fraudster. I can dig through the docs, links when I get home five minutes. Yes, please, that would be super helpful. Okay, that'd be great to talk about. It's strange that David Grush has mentioned of having firsthand knowledge edited out of his News Nation interview with Elizabeth Vargas. Yes, it was. Because a lot of people have stated that Grush has not had firsthand knowledge, which he has stated multiple times he has. And this piece was edited out, as well as there was a small piece that was edited out of the July congressional hearings, right, the official video. I can't remember what exactly that was, but yes. There would be no Half-Life game without Bob Lazar, hey. Half-Life is a fantastic game and hopefully Half-Life 3 is being worked on. Looked into the Reynolds from Forest incident, forgot the U.S. company involved, but Professor Simon Hollins has been digging into that interesting stuff. Yes, I have looked at a lot of the witness testimony around Reynolds from Forest. And I would like to make a video on it when I feel like I have something new to contribute to the case, because it has been talked about so much. I don't like doing cases if I'm just rehashing stuff, everything other people have talked about. Sorry, I'm just going to get some water. I'm going to move away from the mic. But absolutely. Rogan mentioned how many times Lazar explained something to him in a private chat and explained a few things. I can only assume he doesn't want to admit to any crimes. Yes, throughout the, I think it was 2017, Jeremy Corbell and Bob Lazar video on JRE. Numerous times there was reference to discussions being had about various topics that occurred at dinner the night before. I'd like to see Joe talk about this a little more, especially because I have, do have problems with how Joe treats guests like Bob Lazar and Travis Walton versus Lou Elizondo and David Grush. Give Elon Musk one year with one of those. One of what? A retrieved craft? I'd like to see it. Max, guys, any comment from Max is well worth reading. This is for any anthropologist out there. If anyone is an expert with or know someone who studies Berber history slash symbology, please reach out to me. Some weird similarities to she hand symbols. Okay, that is, that's interesting. Guys, if anybody is an anthropologist, either talk to Max or talk to me and I'll get you hooked up with Max because Max is one of the best researchers I know. They say that anyone can say an element number and they'll be right just like 115, which is now known as a night now. I think 115 is a Mozgovium, right? 115 is Mozgovium. It was synthesized in 2004 as an unstable element in Russia. But yeah, you're right. Anybody can just claim a random atomic number that hasn't been synthesized or proven to exist beyond theory yet. Seems like it could be a mix of donation landings and crashes and also maybe some shootdowns using exotic weaponry like Herrera talked about with his insider. Yes, Greer and others have talked about the shootdowns as well, including some people I've talked about on the channel. Yeah, one solution isn't mutually exclusive, just like there could be multiple factions of NHI, multiple origins of NHI on the planet. There could be multiple modus operandi for NHI. Possibly some of these are, their craft are forced landing such as the Kingman crash. Possibly some of these are being shot down. Possibly some of these are donated, maybe a particular species and that command some of these egg shaped craft. These almost seemed like a formed in a piece of liquid metal shaped craft like to just donate these craft. I predict element 119, we'll say it powers something when it's synthesized. The gift theory permits the Prometheus myth and the serpent in the garden. Pretty spooky if there's something to it. Yeah, Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. It is, it is a, it is a kind of disturbing and sobering theory, but also very inspiring to know that there could possibly be some sort of species that is trying to encourage this species on this planet to try to pursue a certain lineage of technological evolution. The gifts donations are a test we are not passing. I think even without the donations, we would pretty much fail to pass any test with the way in which humans kind of treat each other and treat this planet. Congrats on the 10k. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Shardul, Intel background throws up Rogan's red flags. I think, I think we talked about it last time, but it's really comical to me how Mike Baker, the former CIA agent shows up. I think he has 14 appearances on JRE almost after every single UFO guest. Joe, maybe I don't, I don't know if Joe is necessarily nefarious. I just think that Joe's Joe. What are your thoughts on Dan Burrish? Night Shift made a good video, quite detailed, compelling story personally, but what are your thoughts? So I've listened to Dan Burrish's, I've listened to his like two hour interview, I think two or three times through. I've also read the Project Quarious document, the really long piece that details the 3D makeup of S4. I think those drawings were done by Michael Schrat. And it's, Burrish's story is, it almost, almost in a way, and this isn't discussing his credibility or anything seems too perfect. It's just so detailed, incredibly. I know Burrish is still out there. I know he's difficult to track down. I would love to speak to him. I find some of the most interesting stuff he talks about, not necessarily J-Rod, but the craft and levels at S4. That is probably what I'd want to pursue because at least according to the drawings from Michael Schrat, the location while Burrish was there and described, there was the Roswell recovered craft, there was an ARV that at least according to Michael Schrat's modeling or whoever created the modeling and sketches for this place looked very similar to the Fluxliner, Mark McCandless, ARV craft. Doesn't Lazar have a sample of 115 hidden away? He states he does, and I think Area 51, Bob Lazar and Flying Saucers, the documentary from Jeremy Corbell, stated that this was why the FBI raid occurred, although I don't know if they're supporting evidence of that. I think George Knapp stated he had a recording of the element 115 being utilized to power or like a makeshift reactor or something, but taped over the videotape, which is also not a great statement. Keep up the good work. Thank you, brother. Nightingale is the middle that retains its shape. Yes, this is what I myself and others have theorized was discovered at the Roswell crash, likely and sent to Patel as a titanium nickel alloy to study as the shape retaining metal or memory metals. You should look into the aerogel, air alloy vacuum drones and the U.S. Navy nemesis system. If the tick tax, not NHI, these systems tech may be the closest possible possible explanation. Cool. That's I've actually never, I think I've heard briefly of the aerogel, air alloy vacuum drones, but not the U.S. Navy nemesis system. So absolutely. Personally, I believe the vast majority are spy satellites, UAP or spy satellites. Matt Ford posted the gloves are off at the end of a statement in the Disclosure Act getting cut. I assume this means catastrophic disclosure or catastrophic gorilla disclosure. Yeah, I mentioned this before. I'm of the mind where even with the passing of the UAPDA, to get it passed fully, there would still be arguments about eminent domain and so forth. I also think more whistleblower protections need to be put in before any meaningful whistleblowers come forth. I also do think there probably needs to be amnesty clauses for legacy program members and so forth. There still was some teeth missing from there and I probably catastrophic disclosure, hopefully in a non too catastrophic way is probably going to be our way forward. Dick Cheney is the head of UAP secrecy. It's fascinating. Yesterday I think Dick Cheney was also mentioned by, he was mentioned by Barish, right, as J2 in the Majestic 12. I think so. What do you make of the claims that the ARVs are using zero point free energy systems? I think that, especially with the flux liner from Mark McCandless, that he states is under kind of zero point and so forth. Sorry. I probably say that there's some validity to these claims, early MHD anti-gravity systems, electro-gravidics, especially the Mark McCandless story just because I think that of most of the whistleblowers Greer talked to in the 2001 disclosure project, I think McCandless probably has the most interesting and fascinating story and something that is still very relevant to today. So I think that a zero point, I've heard rumors that of various types of propulsion systems for ARVs, including electro-gravidics and so forth, but zero point, that corresponds to McCandless's story, and I find that a fantastic one. The Susan Goev, Rogan. Two detailed, like Cliff Stone and Dan Eyre. Yeah, Clifford Stone, that is somebody I particularly left out at the Kecksburg video. He made outstanding comments on Kecksburg, but he is somebody just because I wanted to analyze fully because of some of his claims being a little bit too descriptive and final that just to leave out. Oh, no, no, no, you're good, George. It's okay. I'm not a chemist. I'm sure a lot of people aren't chemists. There's a lot of dang elements to keep track of. Have I heard of the Eyes on Cinema YouTube channel? How many archived recordings video? I don't know how the heck they get their files, but Eyes on Cinema is great. I'd love to know who actually runs the account. It seems like they have media that has never been seen before. Their new video on Area 51 is also great. I think they posted it a day or two, so I'd really recommend watching that. According to Wikipedia, Mozgovium, this is in relation to Bob Lazar and Element 115, is a super heavy synthetic radioactive chemical element, also known as EK-A-Bismuth. Richard Dolan supposes metamaterial is a bismuth alloy. Is there a connection? I'm not sure, but I've also heard of the bismuth connection, but I do not know. I don't even know if there's been able to be a Mozgovium that's been a stable element. I think it decays after a very, very, very short period, and there's never as far to the length of my knowledge. Lab's been a stable version of Mozgovium. Rogan is so flip floppy, it honestly annoys me. He'll be all in one secret, then says his BS in the next podcast. Yeah, I used to be a huge Joe fan, but I've had a little bit of a grudge against him ever since Grush was on there. I really don't like the way he treated Grush. Maybe they just, when wandering around and about, forgot to turn on the cloaking, we stumble upon their ship and they came back to a bunch of boomsticks monkeys forming on their ship quite possibly. Yeah, there are stories of cloaked UAP, especially with Danny Sheehan talking about the golden domes detection methods, which can actually detect cloaked UAP. Of course, low observability is one of the six observables, according to Lou Elizondo. So maybe they go out to forage some berries and come back to that. The recent Eyes on Cinema school sighting was that on Westall School in Australia, because that's a great case. As a Greek, I could very clearly read the engravings on the Roswell Debris. It reads, which means freedom, maybe a hoax. Cool. Are you talking about like the eye beam from Jesse Marcel Sr. and Jr.? Is there anything to Jason say? He seems low credibility. Eric Davis said he lied about being one of Grush's 40. Him being on Twitter, Gary Nolan criticized him too. I think we do have to step back from Eric Davis a little bit on there. Eric Davis has been chatting quite a bit lately, especially about Lou too. I think that I am trying to analyze Sans' story in a vacuum far away from the Twitter stuff and a lot of the kind of Twitter space that has come with it. I know multiple intelligence community people that all think Jason Sans is a fantastic person. They hold him to a huge, they hold him to such a high regard. They say he's a wonderful human. The reason why he may have gone on Twitter and so forth was just because he's that type of guy who just talks quite a bit. So these are people I trust and they all speak very highly of Sans. They can, of course, can't prove his story, but they all support Sans. So I'm trying to approach Sans' story from a lens of kind of openness, just because I would like to speak to him if I get the chance to. But I do think that sometimes Sans doesn't really draw the line where he's speculating versus talking about firsthand knowledge. And I think that can be a little bit of a problem. The person who breaks the biggest story in history is not going to prison, especially as reported, their deaths are attributed to the program. Yeah, but if it's a firsthand witness, they could lose their pension and if they're not getting a big media deal or something like that, they and their family will have no money. That's at least what I know is an issue with some whistleblowers, not the threat of death, but the threat of pension pension removal. I would bet Kissinger was MJ one up until his passing. I think according to British Kissinger was like MJ five, MJ six. There was another person that had implicated Kissinger in MJ 12. I can't remember who it was. What kind of music does Gerb listen to? I'm a big hip hop head. But I do not like a pop hip hop. So I'm a bit more classic of like, I like like the old Kendrick Lamar Denzel Curry, some classic 90s rap. I also like electronic music in Juno Deep. They're probably my favorite producer. I love listening to their projects, but a little bit of everything, man. I'm just not a big pop music kind of guy. Max Barr says, do you think it's morally right to keep zero point energy from the public to the disclosure of zero point collapse or civilization due to economic instability or something else? I feel like this is such a difficult question to ask now, especially if zero point energy systems have been in practice for decades, if for years, if not decades, right now, the introduction of zero points systems, I think would certainly collapse economies and collapse systems as we know it might have to completely shift to a global resource based economy as zero point systems would fix most energy crisis and production crisis and travel crisis and fossil fuels. I do think it's morally wrong to have kept zero point energy from the public, especially if it was conceived back 50, 60, 70s or so on, but also having that sort of, if for the average person to have access to that sort of technology could be very dangerous. Just like nuclear, the formation of a nuclear bomb, the blueprints are kept classified, but the actual knowledge and use of nuclear technology is not, I think zero point systems should be the same. But yes, I do think it's morally wrong, but that raises such a quandary of having to completely reassess how global economies, global markets and global governments work. McCandless could have been fed disinformation. Mark never saw anything, but his friend told him about it. His friend is Brad Sorensen, and do I think Brad Sorensen is disinfo? No, I do not. My pupils, my boy, those pupils, what are you on, my friend? A little bit of cold brew and some bright lights, man, some bright lights and trying to read. Nothing, nothing else. Have I read through imminent? Yes, yes, I have actually read it in almost reverse order. I've read it on a chat on a specific chapter basis. Any thoughts on why conventional jet aircraft and weapon systems continue to be developed if ARV exists, money laundering, ARV may not be reliably prohibitively expensive for mass production. Yeah, who knows the cost of producing one ARV craft? Who is in control of the ARV, what program? There could possibly be elements of the breakaway type civilization here just because Locking Martin has, let's say, a Martin McCandless's flux liner doesn't mean it's going to be shared and doesn't mean if they have one flux liner, doesn't mean it's going to be put into production or its blueprints are going to be shared to keep an asymmetric advantage. Of course, as well as David Grush says that the reverse engineering is used for feudalistic dominance and asymmetrical advantages. So I think there's quite a few reasons why. Not sure all your cards yet. Who knows, maybe if there was a global conflict, you would see a Northrop Grumman or Locking Martin ARV. I certainly like to, but not in that context. No one wants to know Ross Colt Hart's source if he revealed the location. Okay, while no one wants to know Ross Colt Hart's source, if he revealed the location with the UFO under the building, would you want to go ninja? If he revealed the location, would I, I just, as far as I know, there could be national security implications and violations if he revealed this place. If he did, ninja in the sense of researching for probably 30 hours nonstop to try to get to the bottom of this. Yes, absolutely. Okay, recording to McCandless, someone should file a FOIA to verify the presence of the US Senator that McCandless alleges was president at the air show and saw the ARBs. Oh, okay, this is in my notes, man. What was the, I just wrote this down, who Brad Sorenson said he was with. He said it was a former like director of some sort of intelligence director, a tall white Italian man with white hair. He names the name who he thought it was. I just can't remember it right now, but yeah, absolutely. That individual is no longer with us. I wanted to contact him, possibly his children. Ryan would always talk about sometimes if kids are adults, now of their parents implicating some of these stories, just reach out to them, see if they know anything about it. So absolutely. That's his right to change his mind in what, in what, oh, in regards to Joe. Yeah, I think it's just towards the treatment of guests in relation to Bob Lazar versus people like Grush and Elizondo. It's just a bit strange. What is your favorite case of antiquity? I understand Lou being more interested in modern incidents, pre-reports, pre-47. Of course, there's the Aurora incident, but I'd say Cape Girardeau, 1941. Yeah, Kai, I'll find the name and I'll let you know. I haven't written down. I just don't have the notebook on me right now, but yes. Got to check out the Groom Lake mine Ryan Wood was talking about. I found a few articles, Nothing Juicy, not even sure how to start that one. Yeah, I think it's a boron mine right in the Groom Lake area, which would be the perfect foundation for an underground facility. And that was started well before the creation of the Area 51 facility, which is mentioned, which is managed by Edwards near at Groom Lake. The I-beam Reads Freedom. Do you know if Jesse Marcel has sketched out what he saw the symbols specifically because I see a lot of I-beam photos and so forth, but I don't know if the symbols are exactly true to exactly what Jesse described. Everybody's going to pretend, put some shades on. Well, that's because I got a light right in front of me, man. But I think my pupils are normal sized, I think. I don't see anything wrong with my pupils. But who knows, man. The fact that MH370 videos are so compelling yet you won't even give it on is concerning. I'm sorry that it's concerning to you, but I won't. My honest opinion is that I'm just not engaged with the videos right now. And that's because I know there's so much toxicity and drama around them. And also, my research style, there's so much other stuff I'm trying to focus on right now that I will leave the MH370 videos to others at the moment. Have you read imminent? And any comment on the Divide UFO Talking Heads are having on Elizondo stating, overstating his role and responsibilities at ATIP and Stratton going to release his own book. This has become such a conundrum, right? And there's been so many like Twitter personalities and Twitter people discussing this. And John Greenwald made a great video with the OSAP ATIP documents. I really don't know what to make of it. I really don't. There's just so much foreign against Lou. But do I think Lou is dishonest and a liar? No. But maybe there's some overstating his role and so forth. But hopefully we can get to the bottom of this. I'm sorry. I know I'm kind of rambling on that subject. It's been really weird to follow. And it seems like every day there's a new development or a new statement from Stratton, Stratton's wife, Eric Davis, and so forth. OpTV, thank you so much, man. Been here since 3K. I know a lot of people have. I appreciate that. Corona. Eric Weinstein suggests if NHI has time travel, they could be looping back to Preventus from getting evidence of them. We need our own disinformation countermeasures for disclosure to make that happen. If they're looping back in time, that introduced the awesome theory of the bootstrap paradox. If they're looping back in time because then eventually in the future, that same civilization will go back in time. And that means there's an endless loop of these NHI going back. That's a fun time travel paradox to go down. Eric Weinstein, I'm excited. I'm happy he started to talk more about UAP. I think Eric Weinstein is extremely intelligent. Sometimes he is a little bit too intelligent for his own good, but I'd like to see him weigh in more on NHI. The issue of anti-gravity is extremely difficult. In one side, it can transform the planet into eotopia. Under a year on the other side, it can trigger World War III in a few hours. Absolutely. And the study of anti-gravity of late, Jesse Michaels has been knocking out the park with his videos. What's an ARV? Oh, sorry if we haven't talked about this. Yeah, HECOLOGY mentioned an alien reproduction vehicle. This term was coined by Mark McCandlish when his friend Brad Sorensen stated at Norton Air Base in 1988, November, at an air show. He was taken to a classified division with three craft of a kind of a saucer type shape, not like two saucer dishes pressed against each other, but like the top half of the saucer with a ball on top were called alien reproduction vehicles came in three sizes operated off of I think Sirpointe Energy, possibly ElectroGravityx or MHC Plasma. But yes. Have you read the account of Dan Sherman above black? No, this is still at the top of my list because I've been recommended so much, but I'll be fully honest, I haven't been able to get through it yet. But I really want to. Have you heard of the Q94 non-human tissue sample? Is this the implant? I can't remember. Is this the implant everybody's been talking about? Hello, Eric Davis's boss reported to Lou Elizondo, and that was that was how put off or I can't remember. There's so many dang names. I'm having trouble remembering right now. Sorry about that. Can't wait to read about the Scott Andrews story when it comes out. Everyone seemed to have forgotten about that one, including myself. Scott Andrews, that's on the tip of my tongue. Shardles remind me of the Scott Andrews story. I know this, but I'm forgetting. Are there alleged crash retrievals in Florida? No, but I think there's McDale Air Force Base in Florida, which has been implicated with retrieval stories and so forth. As far as I know, I can't think of any retrieval stories off the top of my head, but there is McDale AFB, which is of interest. Of course, Joe has the right to change mine, but it's disingenuous to be one way with one guest and the next have a different guest and say it's all probably BS. I agree. Yeah, I just don't like how he talked about, talked to Grush and reference him. This guy knows what he's talking about. That's why you're getting this. I appreciate that. A lot of the time I ramble, man. I only know what I'm talking about when I sit down, when I have time to sit down and write like a 7,000 word script and then record it. That's when I know what I'm talking about. Otherwise, I can ramble. Any cool dreams recently? No, not really. My dreams are always nonsense. Absolute nonsense, man, involving sharks or stuff like that. I never have anything important in my dreams. What do you think of the carrot documents leak and how they compare to the 4chan EBO? LARP leaker. We talked about this a little bit earlier. The EBO, there's so much interest in this. I can't remember what individual said he had a biology background from med school, but we're going to talk about the whole dang documents. We can finally try and reach a bit of a conclusion or some progress here on the channel. New to your channel since last week. You're the best. You're the best, man. Thank you for joining, dude. Thank you. Herrera's case is so significant because it implies special role for people with sixth sense. If true, this could alter the human evolution goes. Maybe the biological part is the core secret, possibly. Remember, Dr. Eric A. Walker in his interviews with Henry Victorian, aka, no, Armin Victorian, aka Henry, as of the hell in 1980s, when Dr. Eric A. Walker was asked about UAP reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs because he was implicated by Robert Sarbacher, the physicist of the Joint Research and Development Board and co-worker of Vanavar Bush stated that to gain access to these programs, he said to as of the hell and he proposed the question, what do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it, you won't be invited involved in these programs. We also know SAIC, SRI International, focused quite a bit on psionics and human consciousness developments and so forth. And we know that Ross Colt Hartnest talked to him history about a consciousness connection to operate with NHI craft. So very interesting. Any news about Japan? No, not much. In fact, I don't really know any stories of Japan and UAP. So that actually might be interesting to me. There was an article talking about Simon and Schuster publishers winning a bidding war for the rights to the Scott Andrews story. Remind me the Scott Andrews story. I'm trying to try to remember. The psychology of why someone would falsely come out as a UFO whistleblower is very interesting. Doing so seems to have more negatives than positives. It is interesting. I'm trying to, you know, of course, maybe some people are trying to get like movie deals or book deals. You know, I'm no comment on Bob Lazar, but you know, so I could see somebody doing that to kind of get documentaries made about them. Like, and I think Bob Lazar back in the day sold a videotape of the secrets of S4. So possibly reasons like that. I'm not implicating Bob Lazar. It's just it is the psychology is fascinating. I hope the megalodon exists. I hope not, man. You want to sleep in swim in deep water and see one of those. Has anybody ever postulated a way to augment the function of one's own coddit of petumen? I don't know what that is. I'm guessing it's part of a brain. So fill me in, man. And I'm probably about to sound really stupid for not knowing what that is, but please Scott Andrews had some health complications that some adult finds out as a child. He doesn't remember. Apparently worked for NASA as a 12 year old straight up born. Oh, okay. So like the gate program project Monarch, I talked to a few people about that at this point. And that is really disturbing. Kind of like the essence of this are like brainwashing programs for children to set them up as agents for CIA or other things to create like a dissociative dissociative state within them so they can be more responsive to influence. That is really disturbing. Heard any stories about the earliest efforts to pilot recovered craft? Do you think the level of experimentation was happening during or after World War Two? My guess would be after and that it's going to be a video soon with Michael Schratt who has a deep history in ARV stories. If I can get him in Ryan Wood, I know Ryan Wood said he talked to Schratt because there's, I think there's stories of 60s and possibly 50s of these craft being flown around. Chris Lado, Chris Lado, of the Lado files is actively investigating the Norway light, the Heslin lights and produce some great content. Yes, he has. Chris Lado's, I think, is documentary on the turkey sighting, this all time classic video. Yeah, Chris has done some, Chris has done some fantastic work and I think these are the Heslin lights. He's been on this case for a little bit over a year and yeah, Chris is great, great. Lua Alizando vowed for Scott Anders being legit. Cool. I had no idea. Have you researched any plumber firefighters from Antarctica who are also getaway drivers for billionaires who are trained for remote viewing as children? Is this, this sounds like Eric Hecker. This sounds quite a bit like Eric Hecker. Did he claim all of the the rest of the stuff getaway drivers for billionaires who are trained for, I wouldn't be surprised. Maybe they found a way to teach people how to unlock the psychic aspect of their brains by the help of the Monroe Institute probably and I think according to some of the research, some people are more predisposed to stuff such as this. I had a person reach out to me stating they were adept in remote viewing and hopefully I can talk to them and see if their process and if there's validity to this because I'm just, I would love to learn more and kind of have a firsthand witness of remote viewing and some more complicated psionic stuff because I talk about all the time it's pretty uncomfortable territory for me just because I'm such a nuts and bolts guy. I just so much into research and kind of what I know and what I'm comfortable with. So yeah, an opportunity to learn more is great for me. Have you seen The Abyss, James Cameron, Underwater Aliens? Yes, that's a great movie. As a kid, you know, when the kind of the CGI water thing makes its way into the crew bay scared me tremendously. Do I think Bob Lazar is legit or a liar? I say this all the time. I stay away from Bob because my own bias, I cannot reach an unbiased conclusion. Justin Bush wanted to get into contact with Herrera, but especially his insider and he complained of harassment and hacking from Black Ops on an Abduct T support group. Yes, I think the harassment from him involved a triangular shapecraft. Justin Bush has a book. I haven't been able to read through it yet, but I will post it because I think it is worth a read and I would like to read it and talk to him once I can. In Lou Kit Green, Nolan's Tales, the Caudette Petuman is part of the Basil in Gilea. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to pronounce morphological different in experiences. We want to know how to make it bigger. Part of the brain. Interesting. I would love to learn more if you would want to sit down and kind of explain to me more of the anatomy of that part of the brain and so forth and possible theories on how to increase. I would love to learn more. Have I watched Heard Stories Lost? Interesting channel about UFOs in Scandinavia mostly. No, but I should. My girlfriend's from Norway. That would be a really great channel to sit down and watch with her. Have I heard of research, Dan Brisch? Yes. We talked about this a couple times. I'll probably say I'll probably do like another six months or a year of research on him before any discussion of him in videos and so forth. But his interview is two hour long. One certainly is very interesting. Yes, I'm sorry. I know I cannot pronounce things well at all. Have I heard of Jack Sarfati? Yes, I have. In fact, he commented on a recent video of mine and I was thrilled to see it. This was the Off-World Technologies division. He said that he said something like the beginning was great, but the physics at the end in terms of Salvador Pais was incorrect. Now, of course, I responded to that and I'm going to try to talk to him because, yes, please. The Norway diving was cut short because of inclement weather. One short dive is hardly definitive. The 1967 case, yeah, I couldn't imagine diving in those seas. Guys, we'll do like 10 more minutes and then we'll hit the road. Let me get through these questions. But next Sunday, I talked to, if any of you guys are on Reddit and know the account Voller Records, he has posted at this point a seven, almost eight-part series on crash retrievals, George W. Bush, Alan Doliz, and so forth and all these connections. I've talked to him. His research is so dang fantastic. I want to have him on live and discuss his research. So if you guys know that, probably next week, we're going to talk. This page is about to blow up. I hope so, man. But do you ever worry about releasing too many long-form videos and using up content before the algorithm hits? No. The thing is, there is so much to speak about. And with some cases, I might be able to revisit with new information. Like I know Kingman right now, I could revisit and make a whole new video of it with improved editing and so forth. So if I ever do that, need to make a new video on something, I'll fully explain why. Also, I hope as I grow also, I can, I have the opportunity to talk more to whistleblowers and so forth. So no, I'm not worried. There are, I can think of on the top of my head, 10 crash retrieval cases alone I'd like to cover. Witness list redacted another eight to 12 entries. UFO whistleblowers, another eight to 10 entries. So I got plenty on the mind. Plenty. If the 2004 JSOC vs. Lockheed story is legit, then Gary Nolan proposing parallel recovery team sounds extremely ill advised. Yes, thank you. That's what we were talking about earlier. Let's just say that the Lockheed recovery team who killed blue on blue action killed JSOC members in this alleged 2004 incident. A bunch of a presumably non tier one personnel going to try and retrieve UAP before these retrieval teams sounds like a death sentence. It's, it really sounds like it does. Uh, Lou also, okay. Lou can't pronounce either. Good. If Lou can't pronounce, then I'm in good company. The gateway tapes are on Reddit. I downloaded them, but haven't tried yet. Gateway in a, uh, okay. Yeah. Gate programs really interesting. Lou talked about part of the brain psychic possibilities a few times in his book. Yes, he has. And now at this point, multiple people have. And I was, I was a little bit surprised and imminent Lou opened up so much about kind of a psionic potential and so forth. Bradley, congrats on 10 K. Thank you so much, bro. I appreciate that. I appreciate every single one of you imminent has a section on the part of the brain and it's weird relation to, to experiences bigger and denser apparently. Yes, but I am just so, uh, kind of, I'm non plus when it comes to, uh, uh, neurology and brain research. I'll fully admit I non plus. Do you think the fly by video is legit? I think it looks too real to be CGI. I lean, I lean a little bit towards, uh, so here's the thing, you know, the, the stories of Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon, about 23 minute footage of like a, a craft getting really close to a, a jet or a pilot. I thought fly by may have been that video. And I actually asked Chris Mellon and he said, no, the shape was nothing like it. Um, I still, I'd want to revisit fly by a little bit more, but I, I looked at it pretty favorably, uh, pretty favorably parents. Fantastic show. Why do you think they talk about craft and retrievals, but not who or what is operating them? Thank you. I really appreciate that. I think the conversation is shifting, uh, to discussing biologics. I think, uh, by all biologics, uh, operating craft has been lost throughout time when discussing crash retrievals. And I'm not really sure why, besides the fact this is always the most contentious part of a crash retrieval story. Uh, historically fantastic researchers like Leonard Stringfield, uh, state and freedmen have never shied away from talking about bodies and have discussed them at length. So I think when you talk about the craft, if it's supposedly occupied, you also talk about the bodies. And I'm just really glad that, uh, biologics has made its way into the record, non-human biologics. The Kometa report is very validating. Uh, the Kometa report, I might not be familiar. Let me know. In my last video, I, uh, pronounced Shreveport, but it's Shreveport. I used to live right by, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll, I'll gladly take any correction in my pronunciation. I know it's always so bad. Eric Hecker claims he still gets work in Antarctica after whistleblowing their nuclear reactor in space laser earthquake weapons. I can also communicate with the off-world earth military fleet. Didn't he say the Antarctic neutrino detector was some sort of directed energy weapon? And I correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not understand a way in which those physics would work. Okay. Mentioning to Eric, why is my name UAP, uh, Gerb, that, so Gerb is just my nickname. So UAP Gerb, I wanted something for the channel, short and sweet versus like, um, uh, the UAP research files and video, something like that. I want it short and sweet. Do you think, uh, UAP NHI stories can still manifest as ghost stories rather than UAP specifically? According to, uh, guys like Jacques Valais has booked dimensions and forbidden sciences. Uh, UAP phenomenon can manifest itself in different ways. This is an area of research that I myself, besides reading Jacques Valais, I'm not too well versed in. I still think kind of the hitchhiker effect and the high strangeness around UAP is still something that I try and wrap my head around and kind of make sense of when I read about it in stories, you know, Lou talking about orbs in his home and so forth. But, uh, I, I'm trying to look at more stories where high strangeness is involved, especially stuff like, uh, Skinwalker Ranch. Congrats on 10K, 100K next. I hope so. What do you hope to see for the rest of 2024? Great show. I hope to see hearings in, um, November and I hope to go there as well as a possible sole foundation. I hope to see new firsthand whistleblowers. Can RA or MS testify at the house hearing? Both of these individuals I have gotten, uh, in contact with more powerful people than I who have more access to, uh, policy and so forth. So I know both of them were, um, somewhat agreeable to this idea. It is out of my hands now. Of course, I've still talked to them about it, but I really hope so because they are not as scared as, uh, one witness that I have spoken about by the name of TB. Multiple small terror hurts wave, uh, guides installed on the skin of the craft is the thing required to operate. At least some of them it seems possibly. Yes, it does seem. There's also stories in, um, and small paneling to, to dissipate heat and so forth. But yes, uh, uh, I, uh, I'm hoping to have a conversation with a good friend of mine and another content creator offline about kind of the physics of ARV very soon. Kai, I know you'll really enjoy that and kind of, uh, have a little bit more, uh, a body of, of things to talk about. Are we ever going to see the Grush op-ed hear anything behind the screens? I, somebody was trying to push the book thing. I don't think there's any validity to that. I don't think there's evidence for that. I think that Grush is working hard behind the scenes and I do not think he is being lazy. If anything, his, uh, his, uh, op-ed is probably being held up still. The Locky Martin JSOC thing, if true, could have, uh, incited a consolidation of, uh, direct, directorates, et cetera, around the time of the JSOC event. Look at that timeframe could yield something corroborative. Absolutely. As well as like a 94, the reorganization of SAPOC into the program and so forth. This, I think the 1990 to 2010 is a very, very, very crucial two decade period to look for. This is six. I got this from, uh, Saucerco, man. Tell him to sponsor me. I try all the time to DM them. I'd love to rep their merch. I'd love to, to shout them out on the video, but Saucerco, I, I wish, I wish. Santiago, yes, we talked about this earlier. I do not, I think the blocking of the UAPDA is a shame and it definitely sucks. I do not think it hurts disclosure too much. I think even with the UAPDA passing, there would still be, uh, quite a few roadblocks in terms of the settlement of eminent domain, as well as an executive order under Obama that automatically omits, uh, things dealing with non-human intelligence, including AI, to be automatically, uh, do, not need to be declassified. So I think we're okay. Uh, I still have high hopes that whistle, various whistleblowers will come forward. I very much hope so. I posted as, uh, mugs on Discord. I will review it. Yes. There's plenty of information out there. I will review it. Yes. After the live stream. What do you think of, uh, Herrera's claims that the ARV was possibly trafficking children? P three assets, as he says, P three assets. And, um, I think that there is quite a bit to this story of, of interest. Of course, you guys probably know me and Joey as the guys who have covered Michael more than anybody. So yes, I, uh, Michael says that these are referred to as pink assets or P three to use their, uh, their capabilities of their mind to interface and pilot or draw in craft. Can you recommend any subreddits to your viewers on the UAP topic? So some of the bigger ones, like, uh, uh, UFOs and aliens can get a bit unfocused. I like UFOB. I like crash retrievals. It's a really small one. Um, but UFOB is a great one. And also in the Discord, we talk a lot about, uh, good stuff. There's a lot of really smart people in the Discord. People smarter than I. So I recommend joining that if you have not. Uh, okay. Oh, you're talking about Reed's video from 96. I will check it out. Yes. Have you heard anything about James Webb detected something headed towards earth and making, uh, course corrections? Yes, I have. Uh, I'm, uh, I've heard all the rumors and stuff. I probably won't focus on that now just because there's so much, uh, else to research. This reminded me a little bit of Avi Loeb and Muah Muah back in, uh, I think 2021, 2022. Some people say the UAPDA won't do anything even if it gets passed because it's modeled after the JFK one. Yes. Which took 27 years to release. Um, um, I had a 27 year time from nothing. At least it didn't do anything to the JFK mystery. What do you think about this notion? Yes. Absolutely. There's also executive orders under Obama and other stuff that could have still kept this information from being classified. Everybody forgets a lot of new or a lot of UAP stuff is likely, uh, misclassified as as a foreign nuclear material, which is born classified and still devoid of, of mandatory declassification. Uh, there is no telling that these legacy programs could have been outed. I think our bet, I agree. Our best option is catastrophic disclosure. Hopefully we can get enough firsthand whistleblowers and testimony coming forward with evidence. Uh, I thought this is what I would like to see. Okay. You're talking to Talon. You are talking about, uh, 96 and I will read all of this on Reddit rectified. What's up, dude? Any thoughts on the bismuth, magnesium, metamaterial, leu, leopard reference in the people article, any recollection of bismuth or purple, huge material recovered in crash retrieval purple, huge material and bismuth. I'm not sure. I'd like to read a little bit more about Gary Nolan's work with metamaterials and bismuth as well. Cause bismuth seems to be a material that comes up quite a bit, but I can't reference specific cases off of my head. Okay. Hackology has put a few up there. UFOs, NHI, exointelligence, UFO pilot reports, UFO, UK, UFO, EU, crash retrievals, crash retrievals is great. It's a really small one, but the posts are kind of few and far between, but they do post is fantastic. So I'd recommend checking that out. And our usos with that, my friends, we shall call it a day today. I want to thank everybody again for a 10 K subs. And I hope everybody enjoyed the research we did earlier in the video. I'll post the links. I really recommend everybody check out the archived version of Chris Sharpe's article before it was before the specific mentions of neuro and so forth were brought up. And so that's a lot more USO research and USO retrievals to focus on. And again, guys, thank you so much for the 10 K huge plans. Eventually I want to do a live every Sunday work on my long form videos and then possibly do an interview every now and then I'd love to interview more people, but I'm not going to make interviews where I just sit down on zoom or in person, the bulk of my content, because I think that detracts from my research. And that's not what my style is about. But I think it could be a great supplement in the meantime, it's between my long form research videos. So if everybody likes that, we'll do that. And other than that, I'll see you guys next Sunday. I have a video coming out soon. I'm working on it's a waste. It's a project that's a lot smaller in scope than some of my last crash retrieval videos will probably be a bit shorter. But I, I'm going to tell you guys, this would have been one of the most fun researches I've done since offworld technologies division. And I promise you this will be a brand new thing for probably 99.99% of people. And this is going to be really fun to talk about. So again, guys, thank you so much for joining. And I shall catch everybody on the next show. Peace, everybody.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/jNC-0dmH5BQ/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>ATIP</li> <li>Aaron Wright</li> <li>Abduk</li> <li>Abyss</li> <li>Adam</li> <li>Alan Doliz</li> <li>Alien Interview</li> <li>Aliens</li> <li>Amy Eskridge</li> <li>Angry Astronaut</li> <li>Armin Victorian</li> <li>Astronmer Donald Menzel</li> <li>Aurora</li> <li>B.

This article introduced the world to David Grush and solidified the fact the USG is in possession of craft of non-human origin and actively attempts crash retrieval and reverse engineering of these anomalous vehicles. Within this article, one Carl Nell has mentioned, a now retired Army Colonel who worked with Grush on the UAP Task Force. While Nell has one quote in this article supporting the assertions of David Grush, he states an astounding fact, quote, his assertion concerning the existence of a terrestrial arms race occurring subrosa over the past 80 years focused on reverse engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and today I wanted to do a quick video talking about Carl Nell and his crucial role in UAP disclosure. The importance of Nell's data and position on UAP as detailed in his recent Soul Foundation symposium talk simply cannot be understated. Guys, you know me, this is not just a reaction video of Nell's 31 minute talk at the Soul Foundation. I've already picked out all the important parts I want to discuss, made the proper connections, and so let's go through it. I'm not here to waste your time. Let's start. Before we break down Colonel Nell's speech on the Soul Foundation on the Schumer Amendment and the push for controlled disclosure, let's quickly cover what exactly the Soul Foundation is. The Soul Foundation is a group of scientists and academia folk, military personnel, and government or policy makers that seek to educate the public on academic legitimacy of UAP and push for a post-disclosure world. The Soul Foundation includes figures whose credibility is beyond reproach, such as former depsec Christopher Mellon, whistleblower David Grush, Stanford pathology professor Gary Nolan, PhD physicist Kevin Knuth, Colonel Nell, and more. Nell spoke to the symposium in November 2023 at the Nolan Laboratory of the Stanford School of Medicine, so let's break down and cover his key points. If you have your finger on the pulse, you'll remember this speech happening and some apparent leaked slides from his presentation, but it's not till February 2024 we've actually got to see the whole presentation. Nell begins by breaking down the groundbreaking Schumer Amendment. Well, 10 years ago, probably the Schumer Amendment would have been viewed as a UAP UFO disclosure. I've talked about this piece of legislation at length in almost every single one of my videos, but thankfully Nell provides a comprehensive summary of this legislation. He goes on to discuss background to the UAP Disclosure Act, citing the importance of Leslie Keane's article that appeared on the 16th of December, 2017, bringing FLIR, Gimbal, and GoFast to the public domains as a major paradigm shift. Nell thanks Chris Mellon and Lou Elizondo for their tireless work to get these videos released and move the ball forward on UAP. So certainly that was a key incident. The next piece was, I would argue, the David Grush, Ryan Graves, David Fraver testimony before Congress, again lowering the threshold of making this topic respectable and incentivizing some discussion about it. Two of the legislators that sponsored this bill are in the Gang of Eight. The Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the two parties from the Senate and House of Representatives, and the chairs of the ranking minority members of both the Senate Committee and the House Committee for Intelligence as set forth by the 50 USC purpose. Certain members of Congress are legally entitled to hear about all information pertaining to SAPs and secret programs. Nell goes on to state the importance of the two members here, who are privy to all read and access, yet have not been informed on UAP. Colonel Nell then goes on to talk about the scope of the legislation and how changing reference terminology can start to strip away the stigma. You know, shift UFO to UAP, USO to USP, flying saucer to UAP, and ETs to NHI. I think this is a beautiful reference by the Colonel, as terms like UFO, flying saucer, extraterrestrials even, are deeply ingrained in this stigma and are often scoffed at when mentioned, but UAP, NHI are now termed an official legislation and must be taken seriously. Take a look here at the now six characteristics of UAP referenced. I often reference the five as listed by Lou Elizondo, but note item six, physical or invasive biological effects. This is a fascinating addition likely brought to the table by Gary Nolan, who is studying this aspect of the phenomenon. Think about the fear Wagan felt when he saw the UFO craft, or something like Havana syndrome. The Schumer Amendment focuses specifically on UAP, not TNO, as this graphic beautifully highlights unknown unknowns. Let me read here what the actual legislation says, so we know specifically what they intended with Schumer. UAP is any object operating or judge capable of operating in outer space, the atmosphere, ocean surface, or undersea, lacking prosaic attribution, due to performance characteristics and properties not previously known to be achievable based upon commonly understood principles of physics. There's a massive difference between UAP and TNO. And there's a huge distinction between these, and Schumer makes this explicit. So TNO is a class of objects that temporarily resist prosaic attribution by the initial observer due to performance or due to environmental or system limitations associated with the observation process, but that nevertheless have a known accepted human origin. So TNO is the stuff that you mistake at the time of observation, but you later figure out like what it is. So if you look at Blue Book, you know, depending on the statistics you want to use, the 94% or the 80% of what they spent their time on was TNO, was all explainable. The residuals. To continue touching on the legislation here, NEL references a slide on the NDAA's Executive Summary. The key takeaway here is utilizing the National Archives to archive all UAP data. NEL states what we are all thinking. Nobody necessarily trusts that's going to happen, and I think. Therefore, the review board will provide oversight. Unlike the 1992 JFK Records oversight, here NEL references the issue of materials, biological evidence of NHI and technology of unknown origins. Thus, the Schumer Amendment allows for eminent domain of these materials. Colonel NEL explains the terms NHI, legacy programs, prosaic attribution, and TuO that appear specifically in the Schumer Amendment. He makes it apparent that the NDAA was searching specifically for anything that is non-human related. These are terms of reference in the legislation. So non-human intelligence, at least 18 times cited in there, any sentient intelligent non-human life form, regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for UAP based on the earlier definition, or of which the federal government has become aware. Legacy program, all federal, state, local government, commercial industry, academic, private sector endeavors to collect, exploit, versus engineer, TuO, or biological evidence of NHI. Prosaic attribution, you remember this was in both of those terms, UAP and TNO. Prosaic attribution, having a human, either foreign or domestic origin. So UAP is non-human, TNO human. Technology of unknown origin, this is very important for the eminent domain clause. Any material or metamaterial, ejecta, crash debris, mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies, or sub-assemblies, engineering models or processes, damage or intact aerospace vehicles, or damage or intact ocean surface or undersea crap associated with UAP, or incorporating science and technology lacking prosaic attribution or known means of human manufacture. The kernel then goes on to highlight arguments for and against eminent domain of all UAP record and materials. And for those of you who don't know, eminent domain is essentially the federal government's ability to take whatever they want, whenever they want. What is interesting here is that some of the cons infringe on property ownership. Here Nell is specifically referring to private corporations in possession of UAP and UAP material. Nell moves on to make the key distinction between control disclosure and catastrophic disclosure. This difference being control disclosure uses a campaigned plan, and catastrophic disclosure is essentially the opening of the floodgates. All information dumped out there by possibly an adversary or NHI themselves to create social disruption or other means. Unfortunately the Schumer Rounds amendment was watered down and gutted by adversaries to pro-disclosure. Hopefully this bill in its entirety will be released in the near future, maybe the 2025 NDAA. Here Nell states reasons for and against non-disclosure. This is an extremely intriguing slide and logically all six reasons make sense. National security implications, lack of a credible plan, social disruption, covert agreements cover for misdeeds, and organizational intrusion slash distraction from priorities. We know from Grush an almost cold war has been conducted to keep knowledge of UAP from adversaries, specifically China and Russia, addressing the national security risks posted here. I am really interested in the new physics slash technologies that have unprecedented ramifications for all human society. And look at the covert agreement section, NHI quid pro quo. Is it possible and true that the USG has made deals or agreements with NHI, as some people have suggested? And the cover for misdeeds, this is also addressed by Grush. Part of the reason for the cover up is in fact feudalistic dominance, and numerous crimes including murder have been conducted to keep these secrets. But now take a look at the cons or essentially pro-disclosure agreements. Under prevent loss of technological dominance here, look at, some evidence suggests the USA may be losing a UAP arms race. If this is true and Russia or China are near breakthroughs of harnessing NHI, this has global power shift levels of implications. As Nell states, all of these issues are better solved in an academic sector and are largely not government issues besides the cold war and arms race. And now we arrive to Nell's famous slide which partially leaked back in November 2023 titled, Way Forward UAP Campaign Plan Lines of Effort. This slide is absurdly perplexing so let's break it down. To reach a post-disclosure world with proper oversight restored, catastrophic disclosure avoided, and scientific understanding advanced? Nell envisions a campaign with five major phases through four major channels, the public sector, philosophical investigation, scientific research, and the private sector. Phase zero consists of shaping the narrative around UAP which was done successfully by ATIP, DOD videos, the 2017 New York Times article, and UAP Task Force. Notice guys how Arrow is not listed here, I'm sure Sean Kirkpatrick is seething. Phase one, which has a targeted end date of January 1st 2024 seems all but complete, ending with the Schumer legislation. Government acceptance has been achieved, UAP is now largely a bipartisan issue, and reactive hypothesis generation is popping up such as the newly published paper claiming that some UAP are plasma-based pre-life. Phase two aims to correlate signatures by January 1st 2026, garnering a more stringent approach and harnessing of academia like the Soul Foundation is doing. Likely due to the stigma persisting around serious academic research, this phase is still at risk. Phase three plans to be completed by October 1st 2030 and is seen as an inflection point by Nell, possibly serving as the disclosure point for humanity. This phase seeks public acceptance, which is a tall ask if you ask me. Phase four to be completed by the 1st of October 2034 aims to fully answer the five W's, who, what, when, where, and why. This phase is off-target, and finally phase five has an indefinite timeline, looking for an interactive approach with UAP in a strategic end state, possibly meaning integrating NHI and NHI technology with our earth and civilization. Nell has a couple ideas for each of the four channels and how they can lead to a post-disclosure world. So this is the government line of effort. Pass Schumer, grant legal amnesty, centralized the data, create a Manhattan project to address this area, sponsor National Science Foundation grants, charter an NIE, National Intel Estimate to assess the public-private positions of every country with this topic and where they are with it, and use that to tee up a United Nations summit or World Congress on developing new norms of behavior in this context. I think we need a sociological model for analyzing the societal impact for disclosure and then developing mitigation strategies a priori to address that. Now, some people think that maybe less of a concern or more of a concern is kind of irrelevant, like it's an unknown right now, but we need a plan to address it to lower that concern. Codify the laws of ethics in an environment where we might have a hierarchy of being, where everyone isn't necessarily having equal competitive potential. How do you, it's essentially translating our special relativity version of ethics to a general relativity version of ethics, where you've got the problem of a more advanced civilization coming in and disrupting a less advanced civilization, developing theoretical as well as practical methods to analyze metamaterials. And let's get to the point where we can actually talk about utilizing the, what is it, 339 isotopes and engineering materials out of that instead of the 118 elements that were been sort of limited to. We need to work in the business utility of forming consortiums to actually look at this material if the government was actually going to make it available. Codify presence and legal standards for determining intellectual property rights over the material, analyzing economic incentives and the impact to the economy if new energy sources were developed. Nell's presentation is poignant and powerful with astounding implications, but we can go a little deeper here. Now let's visit two backup slides not shown on Nell's presentation as provided by Matthew Pines. The first of these slides looks to replace the Kardashev Scale. I talked about this in part two of my iceberg, but essentially the Kardashev Scale benchmarks the technological capabilities of a civilization and places them into three types. A planetary civilization that is able to harness all the energy from their home planet, a stellar civilization which is able to harness all of the energy from its host star, and a galactic civilization which is able to harness the complete energy output of its home galaxy. We are currently in estimated 0.72 on the Kardashev Scale. Look at this line. Since it is not implausible, given the diversity of UAP sightings, that numerous civilizations may be interacting concurrently. That is just such an intriguing thought, but this new scale looks to develop a universal civilization development datum to try and forecast NHI motives based on attributes. Instead of just a sliding scale, this is a new multivariable system in which what they are, what they know, and who they are, are gauged and plotted. The end states for these civilizations are quite astounding. Spacetime manipulation, understanding reality, and immortality slash physical transcendence are the three kind of variable reference points of these civilizations. I am honestly blown away by this slide, the proposed taxonomy of UAP and origin hypothesis, and struggle to know where to even start. UAP, hypothesis, and NHI are broken up here into three main categories, physical, psychophysical, and metaphysical. Within the physical are origins that span from expected to downright bizarre. We have, of course, our natural phenomena, humans, inner galactic, ETs, and even proto-humans, but then we also have stranded gods, unknown regions of spacetime, disconnected hyperspace, the 3D avatars, or holograms, as Grush once mentioned with the holographic universe. Within physical we even get weirder, with colliding universes, parallel universes, macro quantum fluctuations, pan-galactic entanglement, and distance recursion. And now we get the medical physical, in which supernatural forces, incorporeal life forms, ascended masters, angelic or demonic beings, artificial realities, and more are mentioned. This is wild stuff, and actually, thinking of some fun, please let me know if you would like me to do a tier list on these proposed taxonomies. Just my personal opinion on all these topics, but of course that could be an absolute blast because I'll tell you right now, I identify more with the physical range of explanations and not just the, you know, pretty standard stuff, but I'd like to get into that. Things with Nell couldn't get any weirder, right? But what if I told you he was one of the 40 first hand witness whistleblowers that Grush interviewed? Check out this Leslie Cain clip. David Grush said in his testimony that he talked to 40 people over four years, all of whom had information on a secret military program that has non-human craft and remains. Is it surprising to you that none of those 40 people has spoken out? It is, it actually isn't Elizabeth. I mean, as some of them have, one of them actually was in our article in the debrief, a former Army colonel named Carl Nell. I think maybe some of them have spoken out a little bit and we just don't maybe put it all together, but it really isn't surprising because of the repercussions that people face. And Dave Grush is an example of that. He talked a little bit of in the hearing yesterday about the repercussions that he's faced, which are very harmful to him, both personally and professionally for speaking out. So I think others have the same concerns and they've seen it happen to him. They want to wait and make sure it's safe for them to come forward and not have to face the same kinds of things that David Grush faced. Yeah, can you elaborate on that? And he just said he had some. I'd like to thank Twitter Ace UAP News at highpeak77 for making a thread on this. In Colonel Nells LinkedIn bio, he served as the technical intelligence operations officer for the DIA. Here states, quote, first person deployed from the DIA directorate of intelligence production and analysis to participate in multi-agency planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom as the foreign materials program command representative to U.S. CENTCOM slash CFLCC in Kuwait. Served as the C slash J2 for the one star combined joint captured material exploitation center in Iraq. And as we know from Schellenberger's article, dozens of government whistleblowers have given testimony to Congress Pentagon and Inspector General says sources that there have been ongoing crash retrieval programs of both foreign vehicles and UAP. Could Nells role in this Iraq mission? Seeing him encounter a downed UAP leading to his first hand witness testimony, I got a lot more to dive into here. So stay tuned. But thank you again, UAP News for that Twitter thread. Hey guys, I know this video turned out almost as long as Colonel Nells talk itself. But still, I thought it important to try and break down everything that he said in this soul symposium. I hope you guys enjoyed this breakdown. There's a lot of other interesting talks from this soul foundation event I want to go through, including grushes, Chris Melons, Kevin Knuths, Gary Nolan, Jacques Valais as well. So if you guys like this, stay tuned for that. I had a lot of fun making this. I hope you don't mind the not kind of reaction style. I wanted to watch this and make sure I had all my thoughts first before I reported information to everybody, not do kind of a not much effort, watch through together. So I hope you enjoyed it just a quick video today. Please remember to like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next video.

This video was uploaded by a long-dead channel titled Danny Lampkin. In the video description, Lampkin says one simple sentence, quote, I'm not too sure about this one, but I thought I would download it anyway, for you to decide. Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. This video is far too fantastic to be true. The quality is garbage. This is bad CGI or just a model on a string. But this footage is far more complex and insinulating than initially meets the eye. Let's dive in and try to determine the authenticity of the flyby UFO footage. Guys, welcome back to the channel. I'm your host, UAPGurb. Let's dive right into this today because I want to dissect one of my favorite pieces of UFO footage that has kept me pondering for the better part of a decade, the flyby footage. If this footage is the real deal, it is the best example of a closely filmed UFO encounter in the entire public realm. Former ATIP director Lou Elizondo once stated there is UFO footage leaked to the public realm that he was shocked had not broken global news. We can only assume this footage has been seen but labelled fake or skipped over by the UFO community and internet at large. During an interview with GQ in 2021, when asked about the gimbal GoFast and UFO Pentagon videos, Lou stated that these three videos were some of the least compelling out there and that quote, there's videos out there in government that the public haven't seen yet. There's one that's 23 minutes long. There's another one where this thing is 50 feet away from the cockpit. I mean, it ain't ours. We know that. Sometimes, you just couldn't believe it. 99% sure it's not foreign adversarial technology. So that only leaves really one other option. It's someone or something else. Are these three videos the only videos that you know of that the United States government has that shows an identified aerial phenomenon? No, absolutely not. These are probably some of the least compelling videos. Some cases, you know, we've seen these things 50 feet away from the cockpit. On a Joe Rogan experience appearance, Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense, staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he had seen footage of a UAP right next to a pilot. I'm not sure if this is the same footage Lou is referencing, but I am 100% positive the footage Mellon was referring to is not the fly by footage. But we are now faced with the mind melting fact. There are real instances of UFOs traveling within 15 meters of aircraft. So let's start to break down this clip. I can only trace this case back to around April of 2008, where it was posted on the UFO Chronicles dot com titled, quote, flying saucer UFO film from jet window. The video then began popping up onto YouTube around May 2008. Unfortunately, I cannot find any record of this clip before April of 2008. So this is where our trail starts. At a brief glance, we can see this video is certainly under 240p. But what we are actually looking at is a recording of a screen, meaning someone recorded the original footage playing on a computer screen. So this is a second generation recording. If we look closely, we can see the reflection of equipment. One possibility is the reflection of the camera utilized to record the camera screen. More likely, however, these are reflections of possible objects within the plane's cockpit reflecting against the glass. This would likely be a camcorder positioned inside the cockpit with possible additional reflective catches of a GenTek's MBU-23P pilot respirator mask. Following these possibilities, we must now consider this footage is taken from inside a military jet and not commercial airliner. Well, one such craft exists that has an interior mounted camera. The NASA F-18 variant, the NASA Chase F-18A. As seen here, the jet has a mounted camcorder behind the pilot seat, able to film starboard or portside without obstruction. In our video, we see what looks to be a jet wing filmed portside with empty missile wingtip pylons. Take a look at this cockpit view of an F-18 Super Hornet. The wing angle matches and so do the wingtip pylons. Okay, what about the audio of this footage? We can hear a loud, muffly noise and possibly human voices within the video. I see two possibilities here. One, the footage features original sound recorded from the pilot, played back on a device, and re-recorded from the secondary camera recording the computer screen. The audio could be pure or combined with ambient background noise from the computer recording. Or two, ambient sounds from the screen recording location. Speculating on possibility two, the audio sounds extremely similar to the 2019 US Navy filmed spherical shaped UFO object going into water, posted by Jeremy Corbell, featuring ambient sounds from the USS Nimitz. Check out this comparison. To think about possibility one, here's the ambient noise inside the cockpit of an F-18 Super Hornet and our footage. As one Reddit user pointed out, the audio waveform does not cut at second four of our video where there is a footage cut, leading credence to the possibility that whatever we hear is in fact ambient noise of a ship where the screen recording was captured. Lastly, audio wise, you might be able to hear faint voices in the background. This same Reddit user attempted to isolate the voices and here is what they came up with. I cannot even begin to guess what is being said, however. This does appear to be a female voice. Quickly I wanted to brush over the craft depicted in this video. This UFO is almost identical to the saucer shaped craft as described by Lieutenant Jacobs in his warhead shoot down footage. This craft also appears to be extremely similar to some of the most famous UFO photographs ever taken, the McMinnville photos. Notice the protrusion on top of the craft which, as described by Jacobs, is similar to half of a ping pong ball. This same upper protrusion is also seen in the McMinnville images. The craft here also flies at an angle, something seen in numerous saucer images and descriptions of saucer encounters. Controversial as he is, even Bob Lazar claimed the disc shaped craft fly quote, belly towards their destination. Oh boy, here we go. Lastly I want to talk about the most enigmatic connection to this case. In 2021 or 2022 an alleged leaked classified military communications log made its way around the internet, including a post on the ever famous 4chan. Now everything from 4chan must be taken with a grain of salt, but these leaked comms are purportedly a page of a longer classified version of a UAP task force report prepared for congress. Let's break down this comms log. The log details the cockpit voice recording of a fighter aircraft club 1-1 during an interception directed by AWACS, airborne warning and control system call sign Brigham, which serves as a flying long range radar and command center that provides tactical command services to units and their network. Think of eyes in the sky for fighter units. And lastly BLK, unclear what this is, they do not identify themselves but they use NATO brevity language. The fighter is crewed by a pilot PC and weapon system operator, WSO, sitting in the back and managing some systems. Think back to the NASA chase F-18A, the dual seater. BLK is guiding them to intercept a bogie scene on radar. The fighter can't see this bogie initially, but at some point the WSO catches it in his radar and tells the pilot it's coming at them at 2820 knots. Electronic countermeasures are activated and the crew is alerted that a missile has been launched at them or that they are being actively tracked by radar. This could have been done manually or automatic. The bogie gets so close that from BLK's point of view, both contacts quote merge, meaning they are overlapping at the current resolution and the fighter's crew have had no visual contact yet. They declare the target as quote bogie dope. When the crew confirms that they see nothing, they ask for further instructions from BLK who tells them to stand by. The crew then see an object on the starboard wing quote hanging out about 10 to 15 feet from the canopy. The pilot is shocked, however BLK tells them not to change velocity or vector, BLK tells the crew to quote open your blue envelopes and snooze, essentially telling the crew to confirm their weapons are off and then to open an envelope and proceed with briefed mission control procedures which may include radio silence or channel changes. The described events in this comms log line up almost exactly with the bogie scene off the starboard wing of our F-A-18 in our video, does it not? But is this document real? And does it describe our flyby sighting? Our footage's connection to this comms log starts to dive into a deep rabbit hole. And stay with me here. If this is indeed an online LARP, it was constructed by someone who is very familiar with Pilot Lingo. As we talked about, this page is purportedly a leaked page from an appendix of the longer classified version of the UAP Task Force Report. Look at the top of this page, Appendix F4B.13 from page 508. Well, there is another alleged page from this leaked document. Section 5, Behavioral Data Analysis. It tells 1292 UFO cases by the joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS, and SAP-cleared experts by the DOD. What is absolutely insane about this document are the conclusions presented on this page that some UA slash SP unidentified aerial slash submerged phenomena. This in my opinion gives a little credence to the document giving the distinction between aerial and submerged. Anyways, that these conclusions result that UAP are either remote or autonomous drones or a form of mechanical life. This document asserts that an, quote, organic species has been deploying UA slash SP that have seen a rapid increase in flight performance indicating a, quote, stepped virtual evolution process. According to one mentioned Shibakoya, gradual changes in the UA SP appearance and behavior highlight generational changes. I have done an exhausting search into the names mentioned on this page, M. Harman, S. McCarron, and K. Shibakoya, and the, quote, blackout flower report and, quote, layer three behavioral assessment. But I have found almost nothing. We have to assume these are pseudonyms used or first names of these people removed entirely. My only luck has been able to find Juan-Hillary S. McCarron, whose LinkedIn page features her as a research neuroscientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. As a neuroscientist, her hand featured on a page allegedly studying UFO behavior fits. I'll be doing more investigation here, but guys, if I am disappeared, you know why. At the bottom of the page featuring the names and reports, look at Appendix F, section 4B, titled DOD 1992 through 2017 High Value Witness Interviews. Real or faked, our comms log is featured in this section five behavioral data analysis. These are both featured in the same allegedly leaked document. The latest contribution to this report was from K. Shibakoya in 2020, and during this time the UAP Task Force was still running 2017-22, so possibly this is an internal report from the UAP Task Force. Could this alleged report be true and subsequent Appendix comm log detail are fly by footage as a quote high value witness testimony? If so, that makes our fly by footage one of the most crucial pieces of UFO footage ever taken. But still, this footage remains so anomalous. What's up guys, it's UAP Gerb, thank you for joining me today, look, I'm sorry I'm a little bit disheveled, I just got back from training, but I wanted to wrap this video up and see what you guys think about this fly by case. I wanted to take a quick break from some of our more documentary style fact analysis and do a little speculation, but you know with me we don't just speculate, we try to break everything down. Unfortunately I'm not a CGI expert, I have no experience in any sort of CGI or much kind of in depth video editing, so if you do and you can perform an analysis on this fly by footage try to determine if in fact this video has some sort of CGI, some clipping, some differential frame rates between the object and the ambient picture. Get in contact with me at UAPGerb at gmail.com and let me know and maybe you and I can make a part two to this case and crisp it up because as it stands right now this case is incredibly anomalous and as you've seen there's a pretty wild rabbit hole behind this case especially with the supposed UAPTF leak document. So let me know what you think about this case, I know the footage seems a little too good to be true, but at the end of the day we don't know if it is, very well it could be. So thank you for joining me, remember to like and subscribe, let me know what you thought and I will catch you guys next time.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/qD1KnudMCO0/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>Appendix</li> <li>Appendix F</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Brigham</li> <li>Christopher Mellon</li> <li>Danny Lampkin</li> <li>Jeremy Corbell</li> <li>Joe Rogan</li> <li>Juan-Hillary S.

Dugway's official mission is to test top-secret weapons and aerospace systems, but UFO researchers believe the true purpose of Area 52 is even more sinister. When you imagine UFO legacy program operations focused on the retrieval and exploitation of technologies of unknown origin, what kind of facilities come to mind? Is it Area 51, and it's alleged legendary auxiliary site S-4? Maybe you think of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, and it's possible off-world technologies division? Or perhaps you reference China Lake Weapon Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, or any number of U.S. Department of Defense installations that are steeped in UFO lore? Maybe, just maybe, when imagining UFO legacy program locations, you picture Dugway Proving Ground, an enormous 1,300 square mile U.S. Army installation nestled between three mountain ranges in remote Utah that specializes in the testing of biological and chemical weapons. Even referred to as Area 52, Dugway Proving Ground rose to prominence in the late 90s as the successor to Area 51's UFO programs due to heavy public exposure on the once-denied Nevada site. Ever since, the Utah site and accompanying two premier MRTFBs have been the focus for deep-six clandestine UAP operations. But this spotlight doesn't solely focus on the enormous facilities sprawling across the Utah desert. Dugway has additionally been accused as the location of a dumb, a deep underground military base. Today we shed light on Dugway and discussion of its technologies of unknown origin, exploitation programs, and subterranean presence. Through analysis of the facility's intriguing Army and Air Force MRTFBs, study of defense contractors present on site, and careful evaluation of the witness testimony of one MS, who I have covered on this channel before, who stumbled upon a craft of likely non-human origin at the infamous Dugway range. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we venture into the world of legacy UFO programs to analyze Dugway Proving Ground. How deep does the rabbit hole go between the United States' premier biological and chemical weapons testing facility and non-human technology? But individuals, military units, and corporations possibly engage with Dugway and UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs. And does Dugway operate such UFO programs above and below the Earth's surface? Join me today as we find out. Dugway Proving Ground is located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Tawilla County, Utah. The site encompasses over 1,250 square miles and it is larger than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. The site itself is ideal for seclusion and privacy free from urban encroachment, light pollution, and excess acoustic and electronic noise. Dugway is surrounded by mountains, salt flats, and desert terrain. These geological features combined with a defense retainer that will apprehend approaching civilians with armed personnel and black-op helicopters. Make the Utah Proving Ground perfect for clandestine and classified military test and evaluation. Dugway was founded in 1942 with the mission to test U.S. and allied chemical and biological defense systems and perform nuclear, biological, and chemical survivability testing and training of defense material using chemical and biological agents and stimulants. The Utah Proving Ground uses its state-of-the-art laboratories and chambers to conduct testing and training under environmentally controlled conditions. Dugway's inception arose from the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks which quickly saw the United States military increase military capabilities in numerous areas including chemical and biological warfare. The infamous site has participated in the never-ending global war on terrorism, employing Special Forces mission rehearsals, classified testing, and biochem urgent need equipment testing. Dugway has a laundry list of significant accomplishments including unmanned aerial systems test support, but we will skip over exploring this entire list of accomplishments. According to a 2021 U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground Mission and Capabilities Overview public report, Dugway is a massive contributor to Utah's economy. Deploying a total of 2,120 employees in residence, 784 of which are primarily Army and Air Force contractors, 622 of which consist of primary mission and installation contracting command, think on-site security personnel, and 486 of these military or defense agency civilians. Dugway or DPG, as we'll refer to it throughout this project, partners with myriad U.S. military, government, and intelligence agencies including many that harbor our interest throughout this investigation. U.S. Army Airborne, Navy, SOCOM, a.k.a. Special Operations Command, the 388th Range Squadron out of Hill Air Force Base, Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Interior, NASA, and three universities. Out of these three universities, I would like to draw specific mention to Utah State University. U.S.U. employs a university affiliated research center, UARC, for the Missile Defense Agency known as the Space Dynamics Laboratory. In numerous projects, I have spoken on UARCs and their similar counterparts Federally Funded Research and Development Center's FFRDCs. FFRDCs and UARCs are semi-private, DOD-driven research and development institutions. I have spoken ad nauseam, our key contributors to UAP legacy programs. While not the topic of today, UARCs and FFRDCs likely exist as a sort of project manager, serving as subject matter experts and research and development leaders for joint corporate and U.S. government UAP programs. In fact, I believe these two types of institutions to be exponentially more knowledgeable on and crucial to UFO exploitation programs than most defense contractors through their sole source contracts. On this topic for another day, however, FFRDC will come up again throughout this presentation. For this investigation, we will primarily be focusing on two locations on Dugway known as MRTFBs, Major Range Test and Facility Bases. MRTFBs are known as the, quote, core set of DOD test and evaluation infrastructure and associated workforce that must be preserved as a national asset to provide T&amp;E capabilities to support the DOD acquisition system, end quote. The quote unquote critical core of test bases comprise over 10 million acres of land in the United States, employ over 25,000 people annually and receive over $4 billion in acknowledged funding annually. There exists a total of 23 acknowledged MRTFBs, eight Army including Yuma Test Center, Arizona and White Sands missile range. Six Navy installations including Naval Air Warfare Center Pax River and China Lake Naval Warfare Center and seven Air Force Bases including Edwards 412 Test Wing, Nevada Test and Training Range and the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg and two defense agency bases. Many here will associate all listed locations with mentions of UFO legacy programs. I myself have extensively published on witness Ed, who spoke of a joint UFO reverse engineering operation between the Nevada Test and Training Range and Edwards 412 Test Wing in California. I strongly recommend viewing this project if you have not already. Dugway Proving Ground possesses one such MRTFB, the US Army's West Desert Test Center and also shares the South Range of the Air Force's MRTFB, Utah Test and Training Range with nearby Hill Air Force Base. Pay close attention to these two major bases as when we analyze the testimony of MS we will be exploring a thesis of a joint Army and Air Force legacy program comprised of the WDTC West Desert Test Center and the UTTR Utah Test and Training Range that extend deep below the Earth's surface. And while on the subject of MRTFB's we will dive into much more detail later on including discussing the Avery Technical Center and shared Michael Army Airfield which I believe is the operational above ground testing location of this joint UFO project. But before we venture into Dugway's history with UFO, let's touch on one more thing while the West Desert Test Center is fresh in your mind. Investors at WDTC are spearheaded by Army Test and Evaluation Command. As we begin to implicate Dugway and thus ATEC as engaging in UFO legacy programs I find the Army Test and Evaluation Organization structure well worth referencing. Analyzing the reporting structure of ATEC, far up the food chain we can observe the Secretary of the Army as well as the Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army answering directly to the US Secretary of Defense. Those subsets pertain to these four positions including Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. But what is interesting here is oversight and TNE policy as well as USA Tech Command is independent from Conventional Army Research and Development Test and Evaluation structure. This independence is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This separation exists apparently to ensure warfighter safety through unbiased evaluation as well as credibility with decision makers, but I can't help but to think here such a structure could quickly lead to a lack of oversight on ATEC programs and thus a lack of oversight on West Desert Test Center programs at Dugway Proving Ground. Let us pause and reflect on historical mentions of Dugway and analyze how and why this site has often been referred to as Area 52. Serving as the United States premiered biological and chemical weapons facility, it is no surprise the secrets of Dugway and its decades of classified operations are held close to the chest of US military and intelligence. I would like to briefly discuss a fascinating alleged 1953 UFO crash retrieval case that occurred less than one month after and solely 200 miles north of the infamous 1953 Kingman, Arizona crash. The Garrison, Utah UFO crash retrieval was investigated at length by UFO researcher Steve Jones and relayed as a moderate confidence case in Ryan S. Woods masterpiece Magic Eyes Only. Steve Jones was first introduced to the case by a group called the Phoenix Project in 1993. A group member Al discussed the case with 10-15 large aerial photos dated June of 1953. These images apparently depicted a large valley with a triangular shaped area on the ground. A remote station resides alongside the feature called the Desert Range Experimental Station, or DRES, which is located on the southwest of Dugway's West Desert Test Center extending from Tuila to Millard County. DRES is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an arm of the Department of Agriculture. The Phoenix Project group presented to Jones a DRES logbook dated 1979-1980 that featured peculiar entries such as USAF and Army personnel from Fort Carson, Colorado, USAF command center personnel and representatives from a defense contractor. Phoenix Project believed the DRES to be a front for a secret research facility that studied a crashed UFO that was buried resulting in the surrounding geology. During his many visits to the site, Steve Jones was indeed able to track down witnesses who claimed to see such a crashed object. Local resident Bart Wright claimed as a child living 8 miles outside of Garrison, he saw a strange blue light streak across the sky and crash near the side of the valley containing DRES. According to Wright, the impact caused the ground to shake and sky to light up. Steve Jones hired a geologist in 1999 named Lamont Sorensen to conduct magnimeter and seismic tests on the triangular formation where the craft allegedly crashed. The geologist found no evidence of underground anomalies but did claim he did not think the formation was made by nature. He thought that some kind of artificial digging process did in fact take place. Whenever a buried UFO is mentioned, this leads to an interesting case but ultimately the Garrison Utah crash is a dead end. I would also like to reference the story of the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle many viewers of this channel will be quite familiar with. During his decades of investigating into the copy vehicles observed by primary witness Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, the late Mark McCandlish would encounter multiple witnesses who had encountered and seen craft similar to the instantly identifiable Fluxliner. Of note were two photographs McCandlish obtained possession of from USAF Captain Harvey Williams. Williams photographed this disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah. The object bears striking resemblance to the Fluxliner and possibly details an intriguing evolution in imaging technology from 1967 to Brad's observation in 1988. Let me explain. Brad and McCandlish claim the ARV flew via a synthetic vision system overlapping cameras that allowed for a pilot inside the craft to access full 3D view when operating the craft. The cameras were housed in protective acrylic bubbles almost appearing as off-the-shelf components. Due to cameras being much larger in 1967, if the USAF Captain did indeed photograph an early model of the Fluxliner, this would feature a larger synthetic vision system to accommodate larger camera technology. But I am equally, if not more, interested in the location of this sighting at a low altitude of 12,000 feet. Provo, Utah is only 100 miles from Dugway and less than 75 miles from Hill Air Force Base. Remember what we discussed earlier, Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share runways such as the Dugway-Michael Army Airfield and operate together in the Utah Test and Training Range Southern Area. Also recall the numerous mentions of MRTFBs and how two such critical cores reside on Dugway. I would once again like to reference witness Ed and the Joint Reverse Engineering Program between the Edwards 412th Test Wing and the Nevada Test and Training Range. Both the 412th and NTTR are Air Force MRTFBs just as the UTTR is. The testimony of Ed explores two MRTFBs working in conjunction to test reverse engineered vehicles. USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet stated the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle saw operations at Area 51 which is part of the NTTR and pilots inside the triangle were pulled from Edwards Air Force Test Pilot School, part of the 412th. The Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicles were allegedly shown at Norton Air Force Base in 1988, which is with an extreme proximity to the fabled USAF Plant 42 and Edwards Air Force Base. If Harvey Williams did indeed image early iterations of the Fluxliner, this would imply a UFO reverse engineering and ARV testing program between two MRTFBs. Utah Test and Training Range and Edwards 412th Test Wing. This is incredibly similar to the claims of Ed and Fouchet. Further in this exploration, we will investigate a possible UFO legacy program operating across both Army and Air Force MRTFBs at Dugway, but we will save this for later. In June of 1997, Popular Mechanics Magazine published a stunning monthly issue. The titular article titled The New Area 51 discussed the Air Force abandoning its once most secretive site for top secret testing and moved to a new, more private location. Let's, of course, dive into this intriguing article to discover the quote-unquote New Area 51 and its secret airbase operations. Right off the jump, the images in this piece are fascinating. We see a sticky note that says, Call Admiral Inman at Science Applications International. Now I know this isn't the subject of the video, but for an article that mocks the idea of UFO reverse engineering programs by claiming those who believe the X-Files and existence of a Dress Collection by former FBI Director Edgar Hoover are the type of people to believe in UFO crash retrievals, why is Bobby Ray Inman mentioned? Members of this channel may recall recent mention of Inman in the Northrop Grumman Project. Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former NSA Director, CIA Deputy Director, and Science Applications International Corporation SAIC Board Member, once discussed UFO recovered vehicles to NASA mission specialist Bob Eschler. Inman also referred Eschler to retired Rear Admiral and BDM Board Member Sumner Shapiro, who informed Eschler, UAP retrievals would see teams take apart craft, pack them up, and ship them around the country to different laboratories. Inman is an integral figure in the discussion of UFO crash retrievals in the 1980s. And I do not need to go into SAIC and their likely involvement in an off-world technologies division at NSWC Crane. This tiny sticky note in a rather deprecating article is incredibly interesting. The popular mechanics piece states due to overexposure as America's worst kept secret Area 51 shut down. This is of course objectively false, however. Later individuals we will discuss in this project reference a percentage of up to 40% of Area 51's clandestine operations moving to Dugway. One primary reason for the move out of Area 51 according to the popular mechanics author Jim Wilson was the need for a different type of proving ground for ultra high performance military aircraft. After some impressive sleuthing including referencing Air Force Base Command General Howell Estes and NASA Administrator Daniel Golden's 1997 agreement to share quote unquote redundant assets, as well as a 1996 NASA announcement stating Michael Army Airfield would share as a runway for several X-33 missions popular mechanics narrowed in on Utah. In a quick side note, the X-33 aircraft capable of Mach 15 was a Lockheed Martin Skunkworks production formed out of the Palmdale facility. Both Michael Army Airfield which shits nestled on Dugway's West Desert Test Center within the Avery Technical Center and don't worry much more on this later. As well as Green River Utah Launch Complex part of White Sands missile range were ideal installations for the new Area 51. Michael Army Airfield possessed an equally if not more deterring surrounding area than Area 51. Not only is the airfield situated on 1300 square miles of Dugway ranges but it is also bordered by numerous mountain ranges and salt flats. The airfield did however lack adequate landing runways according to popular mechanics which is why Utah Launch Complex situated only 200 miles away served as the ideal dance partner for the Michael Army Airfield. The magazine attempted flyovers of the airfield to snap images of the surrounding area but were warned of being shot down. Additionally, the magazine attempted to purchase satellite imagery of the Utah Launch Complex but was denied due to security reasons. The claims of a new Area 51 are not isolated to mainstream publishers like popular mechanics. Let's revisit the testimony of Edgar Fouchet in the TR-3B. Like I said in the Northrop Project, many are critical of Fouchet due to his claims of a reverse-engineered triangular alien reproduction vehicle with little in the way of physical proof. However, his disclosures have led to incredibly actionable intelligence and worthwhile investigation. In his 1998 IUFOC, International UFO Congress Presentation, Fouchet presented comprehensive disclosures of TR-3B, Area 51, NSA's Men in Black Treat, EG&amp;G, and Project Red Light, as well as the DARCE Defense Advanced Research Center which I have talked about numerous times on this channel. In the presentation, Fouchet made mention to a source informing him beginning in 1992 the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to massive public attention on Area 51. This would see the majority of exotic Air Force platforms relocated to Utah, Colorado, Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia, and south of Area 51 to S-4. And there is evidence to show a heavy focus on Area 51 and UFO programs in the early 1990s which may in fact have seen projects moved out of Area 51 Groom Lake. In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least 8 black programs flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional technologies. An unnamed source Goodall knew for 12 years stationed at Groom Lake later explained that UAP positively existed at the base while another source stated, quote, we have things out there that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies, end quote. Programs of Area 51 moving clandestine operations to Dugway were additionally made by one A.H. A.H claimed to be a former Boeing employee who leveraged significant knowledge on UFO legacy programs from friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, ONI, NRO, Area 51, the Air Force Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and others. A.H appeared as a primary witness on Stephen Greer's 2001 excellent disclosure briefing document and had his testimony taped in the year 2000. Now it's worth noting as I discussed in the Northrop project, A.H is likely a primary source of information for Dr. Stephen Greer, similar to UFO researcher William Hamilton. As A.H has been in contact with Greer for decades, and Greer repeats much of what A.H has stated in the past. Greer talks often of Dugway as a primary UFO legacy program site, discussing a Utah underground complex south of Salt Lake City accessible only by air in the 2001 disclosure briefing document and again in a 2016 presentation. In this 26 presentation, Greer discussed Black program locations and codenames which relate to the testimony of Ed. In this discussion, Greer tags Dugway as quote, the most critical one, end quote, when discussing Black program facilities. And in Utah, one of the most critical, and this is the most critical one that's new, is the Dugway proving grounds outside of Provo, and this is classified air space above and no access by ground. Above ground, you don't see much and everything is underground. Richard Foch, this Naval Research Labs official, was out there with some generation five or six or whatever night scopes doing an operation. When he looked out and he saw these objects coming out from underground that then zipped over and that were these massive disk and triangular shape anti-gravity objects that were ours. And some were just sitting out there watching him. And that's outside of Provo out in the desert. It is not inconceivable many of Greer's early ideas on Dugway were disclosed to him by witness A.H. After all, in 2000, A.H. did in fact reference an underground Utah installation southwest of Salt Lake City accessible only by air that tests and maintains extraterrestrial technology. We're incorporating this technology from this craft that the Area 51 and I also found out that they are moving a lot of the personnel and some of the equipment and some of the extraterrestrial technology equipment and the craft to base up in Utah. Is it right? And they move very 50 most stuff from Area 51 at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah. However, we can find some extremely interesting pre 2000s discussion of Dugway by Greer. See on screen now a March 1998 email exchange with Greer and UFO investigator Steve Jones. Yes, the same investigator we discussed above with the alleged 1953 Garrison Utah UFO crash. In these initial exchanges, Jones details his field notes while near the Desert Range experimental station studying the retrieval case. Jones mentioned he had learned that work from Area 51 Groom Lake had indeed been moved to Dugway in an area called Dog west of the main gate. Jones himself had collected data since the 1980s on tarped trucks left in the middle of nowhere in Utah. These truckloads were left between Hill Air Force Base north of Salt Lake and Wendover Utah bordering Nevada. This between area is of course Dugway and the Utah test and training range. Recall also that Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share air strips in the UTTR. Hill itself and its 388th range squadron operate on the Dugway-Michael Army airfield. What is more intriguing to me is an even earlier 1996 exchange of emails between Greer and one AJ Kradock with the subject line quote, Area 51, insiders say area southwest of Tawilla, Utah deserve a look and quote, AJ aka Tony Kradock once did work with Greer serving as webmaster for csetty.org. Kradock is also the founder and CEO of Kradock, an oil and gas service provider in Libya. Why did a CEO with 40 years experience in the international petroleum industry engage in UFO research with Greer in the 90s? Anyways, in this email address to Greer, Kradock links a discussion with an insider source. The sender or insider had their credentials withheld but claimed to work on several sites, checking badges and running ground surveillance equipment, tremor sensors, ground surveillance radar, etc. The source additionally discussed EMP weaponry that could fry vehicle computers or electronics. We live in a world where EMP devices are often discussed as legacy program weapons to shoot down non-human craft, so this inclusion is interesting. The source claims Kradock and others, implying Greer, were looking in two obvious directions for UAP programs. Although Area 51 did indeed have legacy programs, the source advised Kradock to look in the state of Utah to the southwest of Tawilla County and west of Salt Lake City. In this described area existed nine exclusion zones, four of which featured underground locations and this area, of course, is dugway-proving ground. The Kradock-Greer connection here is fascinating and well worth exploring more. However, remember this discussion of dugway, Area 51, and mysterious programs took place before the 1997 Popular Mechanics article on the new Area 51, Fuchet's Disclosures, and A.H.'s film testimony. Very pertinent, this insider source claimed to have knowledge of dugway-proving ground and UFO legacy programs before any public exposure. In June of 2023, the contentious Stephen Greer held his first whistleblower symposium at the National Press Club since his 2001 panel. That featured the legendary Mark McCandillish amongst other first-hand witnesses. Viewers may remember this panel as featuring the first public disclosures of Michael Herrera, and we now know UFO whistleblower Jake Barber was in attendance. One witness featured was not present at the event and had his story told by Greer. This was a witness known by the pseudonym MS. So there's another gentleman. I'm going to run through these very quickly. We'd be here for 30 hours if I didn't. I'm just giving you a tip of the iceberg, right? This is a guy who is at the dugway-proving grounds for a key facility, MS, we call him. He was a work for C. Martin Corporation contractor, and he was in a facility that had an extraterrestrial vehicle that was being studied by scientists. He knows the chief scientist involved. He has named that individual to us, and they can all be subpoenaed now. So this object was there in 2009. He didn't know the date of acquisition, but he thought it was fairly recent. Next. He also was read into and had the chief scientist show him the location which we now have of a dumb, deep underground military base that is in the dugway sector, so-called Avery Sector A-V-E-R-Y, and it has huge capacity for parking. You go in and there's a vast underground complex in that location. That location has been handed off to investigators with the U.S. government. Next. This gives an illustration of the size of this. You could put easily on the platform that goes down the Air Force One. It's a very large elevator goes down underground. Upon release of the DPI archive, I investigated all files relating to this fascinating case. Files on MS can be found under witness ID 10655. Due to lapses in site security and data presented in the documents, I was able to track down witness MS and hear his incredible encounter at Dugway firsthand. Investors of my channel may recall an interview with MS in UFO Witness' redacted list. This project was deleted to respect the privacy of other witnesses covered in the project, however. I would now like to revisit the testimony of MS with exponentially greater focus on his claims. The purpose of this investigation will be to identify specific buildings and military units operating UFO legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground as well as explore any and all evidence to the enormous facility likely beneath the ground of the Utah site. And before we get started, I would like to add MS was approached by elements of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to testify regarding his claims and I can confirm this as he shared with me the screenshots of their outreach. MS turned down the requests as he is a current railroad employee and was unable to break away from work for a week plus even when SSCI offered to pay for his travel. I have a tremendous amount of respect for MS and find great value in researching his testimony. Witness MS served in the U.S. Navy and was even stationed in the auxiliary division of the USS Teddy Roosevelt from 1990 to 2000. Following his service, MS entered into government contracting work. From 2009 to 2013, he worked as a maintenance painter and sign technician for the C. Martin Company. C. Martin is a DOD contractor whose mission is to, quote, provide a fine-tuned approach to managing people, time and resources to provide quality services while creating value for our customers, end quote. C. Martin operates as a prime subcontractor with DOD in myriad capacities, specializing in facility operations and maintenance, logistics, construction, range operation and maintenance, etc. And C. Martin does indeed have a location on Dugway located near the administration center. C. Martin's range and facility, operations and maintenance contracting pertains greatly to areas of interest for this investigation, specifically for Avery Technical Center, which resides on Michael Army Airfield shared with Hill Air Force Base in the 388th Range Squadron as well as locations a stone throw away called Ditto Technical Center. Ditto contains the heart of the West Desert Test Center, which alongside ATEC tests chemicals and biological weapons across the Utah range. In fact, the Army Test and Evaluation Command Major Range and Facility Base West Desert Test Center is majorly funded by the Joint Services Chemical and Biological Defense Program CBDP, a lot of acronyms I know, but remember the term CBDP as we will discuss it again both in relation to a specific contractor of interest at Dugway and for MS's story. Now MS's experience begins in 2009, four months into his work for C. Martin at Dugway. MS held a level 5 proximity badge, which allowed him access to myriad facilities across Dugway to perform DOD contractor work. And crucial to note, MS did not have a security clearance even though he occasionally states level 5 clearance instead of badge. MS would often ride into Dugway Proving Ground from Caysville, Utah in a van where all other travelers held top secret clearance. On normal day on the job, MS was tasked with electrical meter reading to allow the U.S. government to bill various contractors working on site. In 2009 is when it happened, I was about four months into working there. There was a kid that was underneath me as my apprentice because I was one of the maintenance painters. We took care of every facility out there and so he called in sick one day. I had to go read beaders for him because that's what they do. So the government is in control of about 48% of that and then 52% of it is private contractor and that's why they don't have to disclose anything. So I had to go out read his meter that day to get everything turned in to the government and I can't remember how many facilities there were. Probably a good 15 but those 15 took me to places where I've never really been out there and opened my eyes up to a lot of different things. This led MS to the Avery Technical Center where he entered into the quote unquote ghost building, a building nicknamed for having no numbers and no insignia. Initially, I believed these facilities may be the material test facility or defensive test chamber just south of Avery across the road from Ditto Technical Center. After all, MS will soon describe the incident location as a clean room of sorts and these two facilities are high profile CBDP test areas on site at the West Desert Test Center. However, these installations are well known and indeed named and numbered. On the other hand, Avery Technical Center yields very few search results and quite often does not appear in numerous U.S. Army and ATEC documents. In fact, Avery is curiously missing from DPG visitor guides while other areas of interest such as Ditto are clearly mentioned. Last time I covered MS's testimony, I had very little to work off regarding Avery, bar a September 2017 DTTF facility description document and image from Facebook. Before we investigate Avery, I must clearly state I am not revealing any classified information. All locations and installations to be discussed can be referenced in public domain materials. Let's reference a July 2012 unclassified report titled Environmental Assessment of the Continued Exclusive Use of Department of the Army Land Located at U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground by members of the U.S. Air Force that offers incredible insights and exploration into Avery Technical Center. As mentioned numerous times so far, Avery borders Michael Army airfield and both the airfield and 40 acre Avery area are the focus of the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby Hill Air Force Base. Avery partly serves as air testing slash training for the 388th. Historically, Avery had conducted numerous radiological studies and investigations into the handling of radioactive material, including utilizing the Radiobiological Warfare Laboratories for the Atomic Energy Commission. Avery employs an internal rail system for the transportation of radioactive materials. This mention of an internal rail system is truly massive as we further on investigate Dugway's alleged deep underground military base. Aerial views of Avery yield no building descriptions unlike the nearby Ditto area where facilities like the Diner, Contractor Jacobs, etc. are mentioned. However, this Environmental Assessment document offers us a gorgeous detailed overview of Avery locations see on screen now. Locations of interest include the 10-02 Avery Tunnel Entrance, 10-12 Photo Operations and Maintenance, 10-38 General Storage, and 10-16 Classified Storage. Now other buildings outside of this map not marked developed slash unclassified exist. However, I am willing to bet this experience took place at Building 10-10 Test Operations. But enough investigation, let's hear from MS as he entered this ghost building. I walked into one that they called the ghost building because it just kind of came out of nowhere. No numbers on it, no nothing. And opened up the door and basically had a M16 stuck in my chest and I had my level 5 badge on. I think that was the only thing that saved my tail that day. And there were what I call white coats, you know, they're kind of like doctors type set up inside the building, kind of like a little clean room area. And you know, I'm sure I don't know if you've ever been in a car accident or not, but when you you have your life kind of flashed before your eyes, everything starts to slow down and you start really taking in a lot of information very quickly. And so that's that's what I, you know, what happened to me is with with the gun and everything else that just kind of everything just started started to fall into place. That thing was on its own power when I hovered, there was there's kind of a I don't know if you've seen the rendering or not, yes, the door, there was no door just kind of open on the bottom, but everything is just kind of just walking there on its own power. I don't always know anything, but the white coats walk around and analyze and do all their stuff. I don't know. There's, you know, a few gift armed guards in there at the time and I like I said, I don't know if they were getting ready to move or, you know, what have you quickly before we discussed this incredible craft, who were these armed guards that held MS at gunpoint? While numerous US facilities actually contract security personnel instead of enlisted men, this is done through sole source contracts. A contract method Dr. Eric Davis has stated is used for UAP legacy programs. These contracts were given to private security companies post 9 11 to bolster US Army and other military installation security. I have found a 2006 General Accounting Office report titled, quote, Army's Guard program requires greater oversight and reassessment of acquisition approach, end quote. This document discusses all contracted security personnel issued by the Army. Dugway Proving Ground utilize Chenega integrated systems. In future projects, I will be interested in exploring both Chenega and their subcontractor, Vance Federal Security Services. Wackenhut Services, which Admiral Bobby Ray Inman was formerly a board member of, is a private security corporation I highly suspect was involved in UAP legacy program security. Wackenhut, like Vance Federal Security Systems, were used as subcontractors to Army installation, not primary contractors. Now, unless contractor security personnel were highly cleared security specialists, I highly doubt these private security companies could do more than scan vehicles and check badges for access to legacy program sites. Therefore, while I do reckon security services like Wackenhut and possibly Chenega have historically performed installation and access security for UAP legacy program locations, I must conclude the armed guards within proximity to the saucer were known as industrial security, Indusec personnel. Now, why that conclusion? Industrial security, quote, conducts risk management activities with respect to the US government's defense industrial base, including critical technologies and the defense supply chain through oversight of the national industrial security program, issuance of facility security clearances, foreign ownership control and influence mitigation measures, information system cyber security oversight and other activities related to protecting classified and controlled unclassified national security information and related technology, end quote. See on screen now an ATEC security specialist role for Dugway detailing an Indusec position. These responsibilities are listed for this role, including one such task, which is to provide backup as the alternate special security officer for sensitive compartmented information SEI programs. Moving forward, investigating industrial security alongside UAP legacy program installations will be paramount to my research. Anyways, MS observed a saucer, roughly 10 feet tall and 20 feet in circumference. The craft was hovering 10 to 12 inches off the ground. The disc had no seams or fasteners and appeared to be made out of one piece and featured a brushed metal appearance. Around the craft were six lab technicians. I believe these to be ATEC and Battelle Memorial Institute scientists, and more on this later. MS believed this craft was in the process of being dismantled due to a bottom section of the saucer being removed featuring a conical structure. This conical section appeared to be floating and was almost independent of the craft. One cannot help but draw parallels to Bob Lazar's drawn extraterrestrial reactor model that he claimed served as the propulsion mechanism for the sports model flying saucer. Appearing by the craft was a flat screen television type of electronic, displaying a mapping system. Yeah, there is nothing on it, not a seam, not anything almost like it was like just casted. Yeah, like if you said it 3D printed, but yeah, it's flawless is what I can say. It's not that you, like nowadays, there's no way to replicate it for us. I don't know if they were going to get ready to move it or whatever, but they had it broke down. A lot of it was broke down. That bottom section was open where you could kind of see into that component area. That triangle, it's like it's floating, like it's generating a power. I don't know, like a lot of everything happened very, very quickly and just trying to take in everything as fast as I could. That section is basically doing its own thing. When I stand in, I don't know if you're careless with something or just, that's what I said. Is it in transition to where it's like, you guys have it out in this building out in the middle of nowhere, but then you have military vehicles around, you have regular civilian vehicles around, but if this thing's on its own power doing its own thing, what are you guys going to be doing with it? You guys going to move it underground, more stuff going on, or if you've taken what you wanted. MS was taken by the guards to the nearby Ditto Technical Center to the Garrison building where two men in civilian clothing immediately began interrogating him. The men were clad in black suits and MS guessed these individuals to be FBI or CIA. Quite possibly, these men could also be the infamous alleged NSA men in black treat. For six hours, MS was harassed and interrogated. The entire duration MS maintained he had no idea what he saw and he was just doing his job. Eventually, he was let go. I didn't say a word of these guys when they sat me down. So I don't know if they knew that I saw something. I don't know how they, you know what I mean? But we, I still worked out there, so I still had a confidential agreement with them. I still had all that, but I don't know where it would stand nowadays. In the months and years following the incident, MS would discuss his encounter with family and friends and ask around to find more. MS reached out to various individuals affiliated with Dugway, including one such person. MS stated, quote, I reached out to him and got him to talk about my situation by accident, end quote. This individual, pseudonym GP, worked in legacy operations at Dugway and possibly still does today. GP was a senior chemist involved in Dugway's UAP legacy programs, both above ground and in the subterranean facility, where he claimed a light rail system connected the Dugway Dumb to numerous others around the country. GP commented little about himself. He primarily discussed with MS what he went through at Avery. What we do know about GP according to MS is he is a DOD chemist by degree and was moved after being promoted to work in UAP legacy programs. MS lost connection with GP when he left C Martin in 2014, but we are attempting to get in contact with him today. Often when discussing legacy program operations, we discuss research and development. Engineers, physicists, military brass, the discussion of a chemist is indeed intriguing. However, high level DOD chemists involved with technologies of unknown origin would most certainly be stationed at Dugway, the nation's premier chemical and biological testing facility. What exactly did GP do at Dugway? This is unknown, but speculating possibly his position could have seen him operating with chemistry concepts surrounding the craft's propulsion system. Analyzing biologics, studying metallurgy, the list is truly endless, but GP did have enough knowledge to inform MS of the mapping system he saw near the craft. And you'd almost have coordinates on there is what I can describe. So the way that that's set up to me is what it looked like in mapping system. When I talked to the gentleman that was over top of a lot of that stuff out there, he said they're basically able to put on that system two points of references or whatever they're going to do on reference points and basically generate a wormhole and drop through. And so that's where he says that interstellar travel is how they get from point A to point B so quickly. In short, GP stated the craft was extraterrestrial and operated via gravity displacement but wouldn't come at further. Now MS received confirmation from both GP and a current railroad co-worker of a massive underground facility beneath Dugway. The co-worker even claimed to have assisted in digging out the tunneling system beneath DPG. MS and myself are currently setting up time to meet with this individual as well. Deep underground military bases, DUMs, aka subterranean facilities or STFs are a keen interest of mine, especially in relation to UAP legacy programs. DUMs do indeed exist. Quite often planned as underground ICBM facilities, underground command bunkers, corporate facilities or COG continuity of government installations. Indeed, even deep underground tunnel systems have been planned to connect these facilities like in studies conducted by TRW. Massive machines called tunnel boring machines and nuclear subterranes have historically been associated with such intriguing underground work. In fact, the United States National Research Council has historically published special projects on the creation of DUMs, such as this 1981 and 1982 workshop on technology for the design and construction of deep underground defense facilities. DUMs are not our focus today besides under Dugway, but again, I have discussed such underground facilities before and plan to tackle the subject fully in the future. For now I'll leave you with numerous underground tunnel systems in western states detailed by the US Bureau of Reclamation. Many tunnel systems listed in this report feature tunnel distances of tens of thousands of feet of length, tens of feet of diameter covered by hundreds or thousands of feet of earth. Now many such tunnels serve as waterways and aqueducts, however it is fascinating to see such a volume of massive underground tunnels. It is critical to mention the Bureau of Reclamation was one of the key members on the 1981 and 1982 joint project discussing deep underground defense facilities we mentioned above. GP would state this underground facility at an undisclosed depth spanned 1300 square miles, which is the size of Dugway proving ground itself. The tunnels connecting Dugway to other underground installations were wide enough to transport enormous aircraft such as a 747. These rail systems operated off of magnetics, popularly referred to as maglev trains. It's 1300 square miles underneath and then there's a light rail system is what he said. He goes that light rail system is connected to every base in the nation and can transport the president's plane basically anywhere they need to without putting it in the air. Maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetics rather than employing wheels. Maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad systems including higher speeds, superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, improved gradient handling and lower noise, but are much more expensive compared to traditional systems. Maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour. Now the implementation of maglev train systems connecting dumps is often seen as conspiracy. However, this is an incorrect assumption. In 1986, FFRDC Los Alamos National Labs published a study titled, quote, sub saline, a nuclear powered melt tunneling concept for high speed lunar subsurface transportation tunnels, end quote. The intriguing study discussed the creation of subsurface lunar tunnels connecting manned installations that would feature maglev or other high speed train transportation systems. And while discussing specifics of the dump, I must once again state I am not releasing any classified information. Everything discussed from here on out is all public domain. The entrance to the subterranean facility is accessible from a tiny building in the middle of the West Desert Test Center near German Village, Dugway. According to GP, the entrance is solely an elevator to take personnel to the installation. This entrance does not supply the Dugway Dumb with materials, food, supplies, logistics, etc. Instead, the Dumb is internally supplied from tunnels connecting the base to other subterranean facilities. When I last discussed MS and UFO witnesses redacted list, I did not cover the supposed entrance to the Dugway subterranean facility. Since covering MS's story, Stephen Greer has taken it upon himself to leak this supposed entrance himself. See on screen now the critical update displaying the Dugway Dumb entrance on the DPI archive. As mentioned above, this remote entrance is indeed on Dugway's West Desert Test Center and is quite close to the Avery Technical Center and Michael Army Airfield, while lying between properties considered as Air Force lease rentals on Dugway-proving ground. Analyzing Google Earth historical imagery, it appears this entrance was constructed sometime between 1993 and 2006. It could however be much older, as satellite resolution does not allow us to see clearly at these older dates. According to GP, much of the Dugway Dumb operations reside under nearby Granite Peak, which sits just west of the alleged entrance in Avery and Ditto areas. What is quite interesting to me is the fact that 388th Range Squadron out of Hill and Michael Army Airfield runs multiple sites on and just north of the mountain. I'd like to focus specifically on the Mini-Mute stations 10 and 2. Mini-Mutes are threat emitter systems commonly utilized to train pilots to recognize and respond to various enemy radar threats. One must wonder if the Granite Peak South Station has entrances to or interactions with a supposed facility under the mountain. MS's disclosures are truly astonishing, and I must preface I am speculating here, but from MS's testimony, a strong thesis can be extracted. MS stumbled upon a joint army and USAF MRTFB UFO Legacy operation operating between ATEC and the 388th Range Squadron, with the aid of white coat contractors such as Battelle Memorial Institute and Jacob Solutions, more on them later. This program operates above and beneath Dugway Proving Ground. The clandestine program utilizes the Avery Technical Center's internal rail system to transport non-human craft and materials onto unmarked secretive Avery buildings such as the test operations and classified storage buildings. Program scientists and the 388th Range Squadron utilize the southern part of the Utah test and training range to test extraterrestrial vehicles or alien reproduction vehicles. This would operate similarly to what witness Ed described with the joint UFO reverse engineering program between the Edwards 412 test wing and Nevada test and training range. The program also utilizes top chemistry and biology subject matter experts from ATEC and DPG's chemical and biological defense program to either study biologics or engage with any relevant aspects of non-human craft. The Dugway DUM communicates and operates alongside other DUM locations across the continental United States, likely hidden within and below major military installations and MRTFBs. A truly incredible thesis, but one that can be reasonably constructed based upon the testimony of MS in study of Dugway Proving Ground. Lastly, I just want to briefly touch on some contractor operations at Dugway. Remember, MS claimed over half of Dugway's operations related to contracting work. In fiscal year 2013, according to the GAO, Dugway's West Desert test range saw about 77% of acknowledged work conducted for the CBDP, Chemical Biological Defense Program Enterprise. Now, what contractor might come to mind that deals in depth with chemical and biological concepts? That's right, Battelle Memorial Institute. I have covered Battelle at length before, including their project STORC, which was tasked by USG to study UAP, parallel but independent to Project Blue Book. I have also investigated Battelle and their curious links to nickel titanium alloys, which may just have been the shape memory alloy recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. I highly recommend viewing that project. Battelle runs a host of biochem facilities, including the Battelle National Biodefense Institute at Fort Detrick, Maryland. This location has recently become entwined with UFO lore as a possible location where non-human biologics are stored. There is additionally now the alleged infamous exobiospheric organism molecular biologist Reddit whistleblower testimony focused on this Battelle location. But these claims are absent from this investigation as they require much more research. To add further intrigue, at Fort Detrick, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, FFRDC, for the Department of Homeland Security. Specifically, the DHS, Undersecretary for Science and Technology. I would once again like to draw attention to a primary thesis of this channel that FFRDC and UARC often act as project managers, serving as subject matter experts performing R&amp;D work in joint USG and contractor UAP legacy programs. And remember how we previously discussed the CBDP programs at Dugway. While analyzing this joint multinational and interagency CBDP Test and Evaluation Partners chart, we can see Dugway and Battelle are both listed as select few program locations. In fact, the West Desert Test Center and Fort Detrick's National Interagency Biodefense Campus at which Battelle operates are additionally quite intimate, serving as two of four of CBDP's primary research and development and test and evaluation facilities. Now, I know that's a lot, but Battelle has historically also worked closely with Dugway, including operating the Chemical and Biological Defense Information Analysis Center, CBIC, that operates at Dugway. According to excellent UFO researcher Anthony Bregalia, Battelle additionally has a design slash build division with capabilities for creating laboratories and other specialized facilities. In one article, Bregalia referenced multiple open source documents that discussed Battelle's facility design and construction management work at Dugway. According to these documents, Battelle has engineered enclosed testing facilities and sealed structures at DPG that according to one technical report, quote, meet stringent containment standards, providing a degree of protection that has never been achieved before, end quote. Battelle's facility design services also include specialized locations such as clean rooms. I must reference back to the testimony of MS and the clean room that held the UFO. Perhaps a full investigation into Battelle's construction work at DPG is warranted. DPG and Fort Detrick's connections with each other and Battelle are quite interesting, but this is where things get downright strange. The director of Dugway's West Desert Test Center is one Mr. Ryan W. Harris. Harris is, quote, responsible for the overall planning, directing, and evaluating all aspects of work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition test and training programs executed by the test center, end quote. Harris received a bachelor's in chemical engineering and served in the army as a chemical officer. In the year 2000, Harris would accept a project manager position working with Battelle at Dugway. This Battelle work saw Harris overseeing several testing and training programs, and in 2004, Harris would accept a project manager position with Dugway and work his way all the way up the ranks until 2012, where he achieved the position as WTC test director, where he now evaluates all aspects of the work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition test and training programs executed by the test center. Interesting how a Battelle project manager becomes director of an MRTFB where witnesses have claimed a UAP legacy program employing DOD chemists takes place. But we don't stop there. Meet US Army chemical engineering core member Greg Frank. Frank served as a chemist for the chemical laboratory division at Dugway Proving Ground from 1984 to 1985, quote. He directed and performed chemical studies and developed procedures for chemical testing and analysis utilizing modern analytical instrumentation, end quote. While serving as test officer, Frank would branch out into numerous vehicle and chemical munition programs, developing material test plans and test operational plans. When he left service in 1985, Frank joined Battelle as a project manager and principal investigator where he, quote, managed both the technical and financial aspects of numerous projects in the areas of chemical and biological defense, end quote. As of 2008, Frank operated as executive vice president for Battelle Science and Technology International and is responsible for over 5,000 scientists, engineers, and supporting staff. But believe it or not, these are not the only connections we can make with WDTC leadership and Battelle. We can also take a keen look at Anders Weiborg, former director of Special Programs Division at the West Desert Test Center. Now working for the DOE, Weiborg once served at Dugway, ensuring execution of daily operations within the test center. Before working at Dugway, Weiborg worked at Battelle, serving as a test director responsible for TNE of chemical and biological defense equipment. Battelle and Dugway share intimate connections, likely myriad more than we have just scratched today. Other contractors at Dugway are of extreme interest as well and will likely serve as suspects of future investigations, such as Jacob Solutions, who performs range testing and lab services at WDTC. This contractor operates a premium facility at Dugway Ditto and sees strong ties to its board of directors and the Carlisle Group. However, due to the intense focus of Dugway on biochem weapons programs, Battelle will remain our primary suspect in UAP legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground. Hey guys, it's Gerb and I'd like to thank you all so much for joining me today as we took this extended look into Dugway Proving Ground. Now, why did we partake in this investigation? Well, for one, something I've noticed and I'm sure many other have is discussion of Dugway around UFOs and legacy programs are quite intertwined. However, there is barely any other discussion or research or claims or testimony involving Dugway. I think the perfect example of this is the beginning quest TV video featuring Nick Pope talking about Area 51 to Area 52. This entire 10-15 minute video on YouTube, of course, the link will be in the description, discusses Area 51 and Dugway and talks about it being the new Area 51. This video even features words from Richard Dolan. However, zero evidence or testimony or anything is presented here. So after having the testimony of MS, after having some of the words of Stephen Greer, A.H., A.J. Kratok and others, I thought it very pertinent to actually dive into Dugway. Now, I have reason to believe that Dugway is indeed a premier legacy reverse engineering material exploitation program. So I wanted to sift through all of this information and present an argument, especially as we started to look into Dugway structure and how Dugway is comprised of two major range test facility bases, a huge piece of this investigation. As we know with the testimony of Ed, his claims of a reverse engineering program covered two Air Force MRTFBs, the Edwards 412 test wing and the Nevada test and training range. Dugway gives us an interesting look because due to the testimony of MS, we can conclude of a joint reverse engineering program versus two branches of the military MRTFBs, the Army's West Desert Test Center and the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range. This, of course, then involves Army ATEC and their Joint Chemical Biological Defense Program and the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby Hill Air Force Base. I tried to do many connections between the 388th RANS, Range Squadron as it's listed, and the Edwards 412 test wing. Unfortunately, there is very little to chew on there. However, I do think the argument presented here is strong enough and there's enough valuable data and listed data here for any policymaker or any individual with influence to conduct a comprehensive analysis of MS and others' claims. Now, of course, twice in this video around the stiff sub-training facility location, I listed a disclaimer that I was using only publicly available information. Now, I do this because when all the way back when discussing NSWC Crane and the testimony of RA, or we now know Randy Anderson, I caught a little bit of flak and a little bit of fright for mentioning Crane and the possibility that this could be a catastrophic disclosure and could be a breach of national security due to this being an underground location. Therefore, when discussing the dumb locations, I needed to preface by saying this information was all public domain. And I thank you, Stephen Greer, for leaking that on the DPI archive because that finally gave me a chance to talk about these locations. Seen as the last time I covered MS, I was privy to these locations but did not think it appropriate to list them. But Greer took it upon himself to list Granite Peak and the alleged dumb location by German Village himself. So thank you for that. And I must state once again, as I did in the last project, do not under any circumstances go looking for that location. Dugway Proving Ground is protected land and protected airspace. These are military assets, do not go to the location. Okay, if that is a location to a deep underground military base, which I highly wager it is, do not go there. Okay, let's make that very clear. Just do not for your own safety, please. Don't. So there's other data to discuss surrounding Dugway. As we saw with the Dugway history, there's not much linking Dugway to UAP legacy programs, unlike something like Edwards, or Norton, or even China Lake or White Sands Missile Range. One of the biggest features of this project was of course the garrison crash, and then some of the claims of Area 51 being moved to Area 52. Conversely, for a place like Edwards, we have the story of Kent Selen and the ARV and, you know, numerous craft and operations being incited at Dugway. There is more in this video. I wasn't able to include one such story is the testimony of current Air Force Colonel Weinbrenner. Now Weinbrenner has a very interesting story as if anybody can remember back to the Jesse Michaels interview with James Fox filmmaker James Fox. Fox discusses a film of the Holloman Air Force base landing and how his friend Alan or yes, Alan Sandler viewed this film and told Fox about it. Well, back in the 70s, Alan Sandler and his co video producer Robert Emanager were attempting to make a documentary on UAP. This is when they were sequestered by two enlisted Air Force personnel and shown the Holloman film and were licensed to utilize the film. But that licensing was pulled soon thereafter. One of these individuals was Colonel Weinbrenner. Now on Colonel Weinbrenner's deathbed to close friends and families, he allegedly said that Utah is where the alien bodies are stored. Now that's a very interesting disclosure where the alien bodies are stored. This would be a very interesting place for this to be Dugway. You know, of course, quite often Fort Detrick is talked about. I do believe Lou mentioned this in imminent as well, but as a place for biologics to be stored. And this is where much chemical and biological defense systems are ran. And there's extreme ties to Dugway with Fort Detrick. So there's also interesting data to explore of Dugway being not just a craft exploitation program on the UTTR, but also a biologic study area. Could this be where biologics autopsies take place where biological tissue is studied quite possibly. But this would be kept under wraps as any chemical and biological data and information and study is incredibly secretive and incredibly classified. As we've seen with Dugway, you know, Dugway's projects are not spoken of often and 77% of Dugway's programs according to the GAO are conducted for the chemical and biological defense program. I would like to know what everybody else here thought. And while you're leaving your comments, let's also tuck into the testimony of MS. Of course, I had talked to MS all the way back in June of 2024. And those are the clips I have used for the conversation in this video exploration. I do plan to interview MS again, hopefully in person, if that can be arranged. Hopefully, that can also be done with GP and the individual who claimed he helped build the railroad system under Dugway. Such an investigation and interview with these three individuals would truly be consequential. You know, I find a lot of value in MS's testimony not because of him being reached out to by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which he indeed was. I said in the project that he had received, I have seen the outreach from these individuals wishing for him to go to the Hill to testify, but also because his testimony at Ditto and Avery leads to such fruitful research. As we've seen with Avery, it has numerous, numerous fascinating buildings that could be used for such operations, classified storage, test operations, photo O&amp;M, internal rail system to the Dugway deep underground facility, just a very fascinating testimony to cover. And I must add, with the Dugway Dumb being just some small type of concrete facility out in the desert, just serving as an elevator to a Dumb, where it's this entrance point doesn't serve to transport vehicles or armor or logistics or weaponry or food or anything but personnel traveling down. I must be quite plain here. In my videos, I don't generally like to say, well, a source told me this, a source told me this, a source told me this, but I do have a friend that has formerly served in the United States Army. This was in the early 2010s that has talked to me about traveling in stiffs, subterranean facilities. I cannot reveal these locations, but he said he traveled across state lines between stiffs in an underground rail system that went so fast, it reminded him of flying in a plane of which he has great fear. So the fear of a plane's acceleration is what he felt in the train. What was interesting to me is the location to which he traveled. The entrance way to that location was a small, what you could call janitorial building or kind of potable water treatment building in the middle of nowhere. Just a small building nestled in a location that accessing these buildings took you to an elevator to a deep underground facility. This is not the only individual I've talked to who has accessed a stiff or a dumb, maybe we'll call them stiffs because it carries a little more weight. I've talked to numerous people who have this is why this topic carries such great interest to me, especially because dumps or stiffs are indeed real. As I said, oftentimes for corporate facilities such as AT&amp;T, who at least in the 90s and 2000s housed many underground server banks and ICBM storage locations underground and possibly underwater under ocean surface as well, as well as continuity of government COG installation COG continuity of government reminds me a lot of when Colonel John B. Alexander, who isn't the most trustworthy in my opinion, talked about Majestic 12 being real and serving as a continuity of government type institution. This also reminds me of what also reminds me of continuity of government is the description of the dugway done by GP, which can talk about transporting the president's plane to anywhere in the country. So I hope everybody enjoyed this dive into dugway. I'd like to know what everybody thinks. This was a very important project to me because, you know, just as in every single video I discuss SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, FFRDCs or UARCs, I can now incorporate such testimony of major range test facility bases and TNE, Test and Evaluation, Research and Development Test and Evaluation, RD, TNE into my projects. Remember, guys, when he left service, Witness Ed served on the Pentagon for Air Force RD, TNE. And this is where he claims that $34 and $40 billion went missing to non-authorized transfer of authority funds in fiscal year, I think 2013 and 2014. So doge, if you're watching, go look at Air Force and possibly Army RD, TNE. Anyways, what else can we discuss, guys? More interesting projects coming down the way. As I say in every project, I do in fact have a Patreon if you want to support the channel. I don't gatekeep any content, only support what you think the channel is worth. And please remember to like and subscribe, guys. These investigations are my heart and soul. They do take a long time. So any comments about your thoughts on the investigation is much appreciated. If you've noticed some oddness with the old I here, I'm dealing with some problems because that is what happens when you grapple with individuals who do not wash their training equipment enough, do not wash their rash guards. So thank you to that person who decided to wrestle with a very disgusting rash guard. I really appreciate that. But I'm also quite elated, guys, because anybody who watches the channel and has interacted with me knows I am an Alexander Volkanovsky superfan. And our glorious king has just been booked to fight Diego Lopez, blockhead Diego Lopez at UFC 314 in Miami come April. So I am elated about that, that the dangerous power puncher Toporio is moving up to lightweight and vacating the belt. This is sweet Christmas to me. So let me know what you guys think about the investigation, guys. Please remember to like and subscribe, and I will see everybody on the next show. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/rePrVmR6a68/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>A.H.</li> <li>A.J.

The 20th century of the United States saw several now infamous alleged UFO crash cases that feature rich paper trails, a wealth of witnesses, and endless mystery. Today we travel to the Midwest of the continental United States to a sleepy town in Pennsylvania named Kecksburg. We're on the evening of December 9th, 1965, something from the sky crashed into the nearby woods, sending the town and the U.S. military into a frenzy, leading to one of the most discussed and debated UFO crash retrieval cases of all time. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb. Today we finally visit one of my most requested crash retrieval cases, the 1965 Kecksburg Pennsylvania UFO crash. Kecksburg has long been a favorite case in life due to the exhausting lists of local witnesses, extensive press coverage, and fascinating ties to Blue Book and Project Moondust. What, if anything, crashed into the woods that cold winter evening. Was it a meteor as Blue Book claimed, a Soviet satellite like many debunkers have claimed, or indeed a craft of non-human intelligence as described by numerous eyewitnesses? In a quick note here guys, excellent research has been conducted by respected ufologists on this case. I will primarily be referencing the work of the most seasoned Kecksburg investigator Stan Gordon and the legend with whom Gordon shared much of his research and witnesses, Leonard Stringfield. In the early evening of December 9th, 1965, thousands of residents across Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada observed a fiery brilliant glow streak across the sky, a ball of fire leaving a smoke trail, estimated to be visible for 20 minutes after the passing of the object. Numerous ground-based civilians and pilots initially thought the object to be an aircraft in peril, especially due to pieces of the object seemingly detaching and falling over Lapeer, Michigan, and Alleria, Ohio. The material would later be recognized and studied within the official Blue Book report on Kecksburg. As noted by Clark McClelland, UFO researcher and former NASA Apollo space program member, as well as Dr. Paul Anir, professor of astronomy, the object would make a change of course roughly 25 degrees when traveling over Alleria, Ohio. Similar calculations showed the object to be between 40 and 60 miles in altitude when first observed over Michigan. McClelland estimated the speed of the glowing object based on the distance of witness observations to be traveling at roughly 17 miles per minute or 1,062 miles per hour. For reference, meteors traveled between 25 and 144,000 miles an hour, so even if McClelland's calculations were off by a factor of 10, the object was still traveling at much slower speeds than a meteor in Earth's atmosphere. Around 4.45 pm, the object plunged into the woods of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. The object made a turn between Greensburg and La Trobe and was reported from local communities as it moved towards the south. Near Laurelville, the object turned again and began to track northeast towards the Kecksburg area where it reportedly impacted into the woods. Closely tracking the object, Project Blue Book dispatched a three-man Air Force team from the 662nd Radar Squadron at the Oakdale Army installation near Pittsburgh to investigate. The squadron was operating under control of the Aerospace Defense Command. These orders were presumably given by Major Hector Quintanilla, who took the reins of Blue Book in 1963. The 33-page report on Kecksburg from Blue Book has Quintanilla's name all over the memorandum for record, and it is important to note of Blue Book's conclusion of Kecksburg. Under the major, the case was designated as a meteor. And quickly worth mentioning, Blue Book states the three-man team found no materials at the crash site. Blue Book curiously marks this case under ACME, Pennsylvania. Why is this? Researchers are not sure, but one possibility is the Air Force personnel interviewed witnesses who lived nearby in the town of ACME. And speaking of Quintanilla, let's pay special attention to April 5, 1966, where the United States Air Force Major lied before the House Armed Services Committee, stating that Blue Book had no radar cases that were unexplained. Scientific advisor to Blue Book, J. Allen Heineck, revealed this deception by providing three such cases, 1951 Goose Bay, 1956 Lakinheath, and 1957 Shrevaport. Although town residents argue to this day over what crashed in the woods that night, the town witnesses agree within an hour of the impact military forces swarmed the area almost as quickly as the arrival of Penn State Police and the Kecksburg Volunteer Fireman. Twenty-eight years, I'm a fireman here at Kecksburg. It does me good as a young, old fireman now that now we know that something did happen. The military was here. Everybody here is correct in what they've seen and what they heard. I think because of the lay of the land and the terrain, there was different points of vision from wherever they were at that point. The outcome of our town meeting, a majority consensus that something big did happen in Kecksburg on December 9th, 1965, and that despite the official report to the contrary, soldiers were on site. Regardless of USAF and Blue Book denying a presence of more than three men at Kecksburg, a statement that will later be contradicted by Dr. Eric A. Walker, Kecksburg residents gave descriptions of multiple types of military men, US Army soldiers equipped with M1 rifles, USAF personnel with blue fatigues and blue berets, and men in civilian clothing seemingly barking out orders and some witnesses even described men in hazmat suits labelling them as moon suits. There are also myriad local press articles like these from the Pittsburgh Press on December 10th that also contradict the military's denial of a presence at Kecksburg. The description of Air Force men may be paramount to investigating this crash recovery case. Referred to as blue berets, Leonard Stringfield made numerous mentions to a UFO crash recovery intelligence team stemming from the Air Force donned in blue fatigues and blue berets. In crash retrievals of the third kind, a case study of alleged UFOs and occupants in military custody. Stringfield stated he had been made aware from other military forces of a rapid reaction special forces unit named blue berets who can quote, operate secretly and effectively by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference, end quote. This unit was housed at certain military bases as rapid reaction units in a constant state of ready to address downed or crashed UFOs. Stringfield even stated to have met a former member of the elite blue berets when visiting the University of Dade City, Florida for a lecture quote. We talked about the elite force, its makeup and functions and some of his experiences in Vietnam behind enemy lines. Although he had never participated in a UFO crash retrieval, he was aware that one of his fellow members had the experience. Details were scanty, but Cameron calls that his friend referred to his participation in the recovery of a quote unquote big head from an alien craft and quote. In UFO crash retrieval status report for fatal encounters at Fort Dix, McGuire Stringfield met with a man named Jeff Morse who claimed to be a former blue beret. Morse would tell Stringfield in 1985 to 1987 about an incident at Fort McGuire Air Force Base in which a non-human entity was shot to death by US forces. Quite a bit to discuss about the blue berets, so maybe we will save that for another video. But I do want to mention Air Force blue berets were made famous with the creation of the USAF 1041 security police squadron, which operated during 1965 to 1967. The 1041s and their blue berets were implemented in Operation Safe Side in which the Air Force deployed a highly trained unit of combat security police known as active defense to repel raids on air bases in Vietnam. But the origins of USAF personnel and blue fatigues and blue berets can be traced back to 1956 with the creation of the strategic air command elite guard under General Curtis LeMay, who I've spoken about many times. The SAC elite guards operated as air police from 1956 to 1966 within the time of our Kecksburg case, serving as part of the US Air Force and US Department of Defense. The blue beret SAC elite guard were tasked with providing security at headquarters of strategic air command of the US Air Force. One such SAC base is Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio. Remember the mention of this base as we will later discuss a witness who claimed to have briefly guarded the crashed UAP from Kecksburg at Lockburn AFB. Let's get back to Kecksburg and analyze the events around the time of an object crashing in the woods. With news media starting to swirl about stories of a fireball crashing in the area, local news director John Murphy out of WHJB Greensburg, Pennsylvania received a call from a startled mother who claimed she and her children had observed a fiery object fall into the woods where a cloud of blue smoke began rising after impact. Murphy, a key player in this story moving forward, arrived to the woods and investigated the scene for some time before Carl Metz, a state police fire marshal, and another investigator arrived to the scene. The two investigators entered the woods and upon returning and being questioned by Murphy, told Murphy, quote, you better get your information from the army, end quote. Murphy would then arrive to the state police barracks in Greensburg for more information, where he observed army and Air Force men swarming the location. Murphy would interview many town residents about what they saw and experienced in Kecksburg the evening of December 9th, and excitedly pieced together a radio documentary titled Object in the Woods. Curiously, Murphy's wife and other WHJB employees would state Murphy was approached by men at the station leading to a radical alteration of his program. Murphy would broadcast a heavily censored version of his documentary, starting the event with an odd disclaimer. And state that many witnesses whose testimony had been taped no longer wish to air their statements due to fear of reprisals from the U.S. Army. Stan Gordon would even go so far as to state he had received notarized documents from station employees, claiming USG elements were confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts and were not allowing said account to be broadcasted. John Murphy would tragically die in a hit and run incident shortly after the event, and never claimed publicly to have entered the woods and to have seen what crashed in Kecksburg. But in 2003, John's wife claimed he had told her of entering the woods and witnessed a strange metallic object on the ground. What was this object observed by so many and that later witnesses would state was transported out of the woods in the early morning of December 10th by army trucks covered by a tarp. Fortunately, we have numerous witness testimony to analyze. There was no tail section, there was no motors, there was no windows, there was no doors. There was big enough for a grown person to stand up in. It had like Egyptian writing, like backwards writing on it, stars and circles and dashes and lines and things like that. It looked like an acorn. It was really weird. A first hand witness questioned at length by both Stan Gordon and Leonard Stringfield is James, often referred to as Jim Romansky. Romansky served as a volunteer fireman whose company was dispatched to Kecksburg to assist with the search of what was thought to be a downed aircraft. Romansky first approached Gordon in 1987 to tell his story. He had previously feared ridicule for years, but wanted to finally give his testimony. On the night of 1965, with the search teams combing the woods, Romansky heard via walkie talkie the crash site had been discovered. Upon arriving to the scene, the fireman witnessed an object half buried in the ground. This object appeared to have descended into the forest at a 30 degree angle, breaking tree limbs before impacting the ground and leaving a 25 foot long trench. There were no signs of fire in the area. I want you to describe what you saw when you arrived in this field where the supposed downed aircraft was. Well, first of all, we were in a field hunting for it as downed aircraft and the first rescue team already found it and radioed into the fire hall, gave the coordinates and it was down in front of us and we high-tailed it out of our search area and went down into there. And we got there expecting a smashed up airplane, wings, fuselage, etc., no such character. Came down into the woods and here's its humongous piece of metal laying there. I mean this thing, I've described time and time again as a very large, egg-corn shaped object. The front of it, or I presume was the front of it, was pushed down into the dirt where the way it came in and landed after it took out the top of the trees and brush and everything coming in. Came back in an oblong shape, around the bottom was what I call a bumper and then the bottom was perfectly flat, no signs of propulsion or anything. There was no doors, no windows, there was no ways of getting in this thing, at least none that I've seen. There was no seams on it, no rivets, nothing. The only thing I've seen was this bumper around it and had these real strange markings on it which I've often referred to as similar to the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. So as a volunteer fireman we did what we were supposed to do, find the crash site, do a preliminary investigation for survivors who treated anybody which we didn't because there was none that we could see. There was no way of getting into this object. The object appeared to be a large metallic acorn or bell measuring 10 to 12 feet in length, 8 to 10 feet in diameter. The raised ring area measured about 8 to 10 inches wide. The wingless, seamless and rivetless object was described as Romansky as a bronze off gold color. As a seasoned machinist, Romansky stated the object almost looked like it had been made from a liquid metal mold and told researcher Stan Gordon, quote, never in my life have I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form, end quote. The presence of the described hieroglyphic writing has been a point of contention for the Kecksburg case. With some believing the object to be a Soviet space capsule and the writing to be Russian Cyrillic, Romansky described the writing as quote, characters of broken and straight lines, dots, rectangles and circles, end quote. Romansky would even explicitly state to Leonard Stringfield, he was familiar with the Russian language and the markings he observed were not Russian. My dad is originally from Kiev and I went to him one time and I said, dad, I says you could read and write Polish and Russian, he says, yeah, I said, write me something in both dialects. He says, what? I said, just write me anything. The Polish and Russian writing that I seen doesn't come nowhere near. I think it imperative to include much of Jim's testimony on the 1993 Montell-William show due to his fiery and passionate demeanor and discussion of how his presence at the Kecksburg case affected his children's time in the U.S. armed services. The first team had already radioed in his position, were there 10, 15 minutes all talking around doing a preliminary search, wondering what we discovered. Two gentlemen come down through the woods, trench coats on, ramrod stiff, crew cut, alright, this is a restricted area. You're not ordered to get out of here, oh wait a minute, I'm a civilian. You ain't going to order me nothing, but as a fireman I'm being relieved from what I'm doing. So I got out of there. We're going out through the woods, we didn't go no more to 15, 20 feet, and I know from me to you, here come the military, full uniforms, equipment, marching right down through the woods with a flashlight. This is December, late in the evening, it's cold, it's wet. How far away were you from a military base? Well, the closest base that I knew of was Pittsburgh, which is approximately 45 miles to the west. So, within 15 minutes of your arrival at the site, the military was there. You got it. Okay, alright, alright, now what did they say to you after this happened? I mean, I know there were several members, the report I saw on Unsolved Mysteries, several members of the community were there, right, other people were part of the community were there and present and were all told to leave. There was no press or media at the immediate crash site. What I didn't know up on top of the hill, because I'd come in through the side, the military had taken over a farmhouse, I mean from what I understand, military brass. They took over up there, did all their orders and whatever they were doing from up there and that's where I presume that the military who came down through the woods came from because when we went out, we had to walk back to the fire hall, which was approximately the way we had to go, I'd say a good mile, but by the time we got back to the fire hall, it was wall to wall military, I mean there was trucks and jeeps and cars, there was guards on the door. Anybody said to you, I don't want you talking about this, don't say a word about this or what they did, what they did, I mean these people virtually told us just to shut up, get to your vehicles and be quiet. I have a daughter and a son that both went into the military, within the last two or three years. One went into the Marine Corps, one went into U.S. Air Force. My daughter come to me from the United States Marine Corps and she said, Dad, your name can come up on a computer as my father, I had to sign a statement saying I would never ask a request for any information from Kecksburg, my son had to sign two statements. About you, about yourself? Pardon? Any information about yourself? Your daughter had to sign a paper that says she would not ask for any information about you? Not about me, but about Kecksburg, because my name would come up as her father. Okay, but you know what? Then, no wait a minute Montel, then my son in the U.S. Air Force had to sign two papers. Jim, wait, get to, just jump to the chase, because part of the chase here is the fact that I spent, I'm telling you, I had some of the highest clearances this country has to offer. I've been through files on top of files on top of files, I still ain't seen nothing yet. Period. Period. Period. You didn't have the need to know. Yeah, but that's also not true. Now my son goes in the Air Force and they tell him he can't even request to go to Wright Patterson Air Force base for duty, because I seen something and that's where my UFO was sent today. Maybe his M.O.S. was something that they didn't have a qualification for it, right pattern. His M.O.S. has nothing to do with it. Okay, all right, hold on a minute. The government is covering this up, they don't want no one to know, they don't want no one to get access to anything, because they're afraid people will find out the truth. During his time spent with Stan Gordon, Romansky would take the researcher to the exact site of the crash. This site would line up identically to the description of our next witness, Bill Bullybush, due to the best of our knowledge had no interaction with Romansky. Bill Bullybush was driving his car in the afternoon of December 9th, 1965, where he observed the object streaking over the sky. Bill stated, quote, the object appeared to hesitate over the Loraville area, then made a turn and then began to travel northeast towards Kecksburg, end quote, where he then saw it descending. Witnessing the object's descent, Bill turned his car and went to the top of the hill now called Meteor Road, where he observed blue lights flashing in the woods. As the sky was getting dark, Bullybush claimed to walk into the woods to the crash site, where he looked upon a metallic acorn shaped object embedded into the soil. The object featured the same strange writing noticed by Romansky, and Bullybush noted blue arcing light emanating from the object at intervals. Bullybush's description of the object supports the theory that it was probably not a meteorite. I was working on a 64 Corvair at home. I happened to see this red ball of fire going across, get come up and went towards the mountain, just like if it was radio controlled. It made a figure eight, and it came right down in here, and Bully landed right in here, knocked the top of the trees out. It stunk like rotten eggs. You could smell it. And then just like sizzling and like sparks coming, just like if it was cooling off, it was red hot. Bullybush is the only witness I'm aware of to describe the presence of a smell. The description of a strong smell, in this case rotten eggs, a.k.a. a sulfuric smell, reminds me closely of the strong ammonia smell witnesses described in the 1997 Virginia Brazil case. Bill Bullybush, who fled the woods when he heard the fireman approaching, independently described a nearly identical object. I could see it. Pretty good. There was no welding, no windows, no nothing on it, and none on the back was a ring, and it had like Egyptian writing on it, and I couldn't figure out what it was. From his statements, we can piece together, Bullybush left the scene upon the arrival of the fire crew, who witnessed the object for a span of 15 minutes until the men described by Romansky ordered the fireman to leave. And we do have a witness who states he observed the craft and retrieval crew departing the woods. In the early 1990s, I witnessed Jerry Betters, a Pittsburgh jazz musician, came forward with his testimony. At 41 years old in 1965, Betters lived near the area of Kecksburg in a town called Murrisville. Jerry noticed the now infamous fireball, which agitated the horses he was feeding and surrounding dogs. Upon hearing the news report of the object crashing in Kecksburg, Jerry phoned his friends to pick him up and head to the town for a look. Later with the area, the men found themselves on a private lane. After rounding a slight turn, Jerry stated he was halted by a military roadblock. The soldiers halting traffic appeared to wear army fatigues with cloth berets, but other soldiers equipped with rifles and helmets stood at attention behind the roadblock. Betters noticed a number of quote unquote military brass officers, well-dressed civilians, and scattered army star emblazoned jeeps and personnel trucks. Jerry's attention was commanded towards a large cab and flatbed trailer. He noticed a domed or acorn-shaped object that was uncovered and being hauled away from the woods. Quickly, a tarp was placed over the object. Betters noted the truck seemed to have trouble traversing up through the field. Jerry Betters also described the truck and his encounter in a notarized document. We do have other witnesses who claim to have been held at gunpoint by the attending military forces. The individual is local resident David Newhouse. In fact, there are dozens of witness testimony from Kecksburg locals and nearby citizens we could analyze all day. Like that of then teenager Bill Weaver, who noticed four men exit a light-colored box truck dressed in quote unquote moon suits and head towards the crash area, or then 14-year-old Mike Slater, who stated an army officer told Mike and his friend they could do a great service to their country by sending curious crash seekers wrong directions. We even have witnesses who state they observed the craft after it was taken out of the field, and we will address these shortly. A bell-shaped craft big enough to fit a man with strange hieroglyphic writing was described by many civilian witnesses the night of December 9th, 1965. It is interesting how Blue Book contended the object was a meteor and that nothing was found at the crash site after all of the witness testimony and trajectory and speed calculations conducted while the object was in the air that are not consistent with meteor travel. As mentioned earlier, Blue Book did receive some fragmented material that was seen to fall off of the craft, sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Blue Book declared this material as chaff, which is quote, material dropped by aircraft to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises, end quote. The conclusion of a meteor with presence of this said chaff leads to further inconsistencies in Blue Book's reporting. Early skeptics of Kecksburg stated the craft may have been the remains of Soviet spacecraft Cosmos 96. This conclusion was not supported in a 1965 NASA press release, which stated Cosmos 96 had decayed and landed in Canada roughly 13 hours prior to the Kecksburg event. This NASA briefing says, quote, other analyses of the spacecraft orbit definitively indicate it could not have been the Cosmos 96 spacecraft, end quote. Stan Gordon further concluded the Kecksburg event was not the result of Cosmos 96 when he received documents through FOIA requests from both the U.S. Space Command and Naval Surveillance Center, which verified Cosmos 96 entered the atmosphere at roughly 3.18 Eastern Standard Time over Canada on December 9, 1965. Some such as NASA mission specialist James Oberg maintained the object was a capsule of Soviet origin recovered in secrecy for its heat shielding. Joining us now from Houston is spaceflight engineer and author James Oberg, who has studied the reported sighting in Kecksburg and has his own theory about what landed there in 1965. Mr. Oberg, first of all, do you believe that something crashed in Kecksburg in 1965 and was it a UFO? If it's anything, it might be something a lot more Earth-like. It might be a spacecraft from Russia and not from Mars. It turns out we do know that a Russian probe fell back to Earth that day, and it was a special kind of probe. It was one of their probes to the planet Venus. It failed, was trapped in Earth orbit, and eventually fell out of orbit. What might have been on that Russian space probe that the U.S. would have been so interested in? Oh, the most important thing about the probe would be the heat shield, how thick it was, what material it was made out of, how heavy it was, and once we knew that, we could then analyze how big their warheads would be in their ICBMs. But in this clip, it is necessary to mention Oberg is still mentioning Cosmos 96. Others have wondered if the craft was indeed a Gemini or Orion capsule expelled in the area, such as Assistant Chief of Kecksburg Fire Department Jim Mays, who got within 75 yards of the object but didn't get a clear view. But the idea of a man-made space capsule crashing into the Midwest of the continental United States was further discredited in this May 2000 Leslie Keen conference titled, Combating Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case. Some of you may know journalist Leslie Keen as the writer of the 2017 New York Times article bringing the Pentagon UAP videos and OSAP slash ATIP to the public zeitgeist. In this conference, Keen discussed her correspondence with Nicholas Johnson, NASA Chief Scientist for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center. Johnson analyzed the orbital data of the Soviet Venus probe Cosmos 96 and determined the object could not have landed in Kecksburg near 5 p.m. December 9, 1965. Furthermore, Johnson stated no man-made space object landed in Pennsylvania on the day of the crash. So I was able to contact an important scientist from NASA, probably the leading expert in the world on this issue and he was named Nicholas Johnson, he's the Chief Scientist for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center. He was able to obtain the coordinates of Cosmos 96 so that he could calculate if part of it had kept stayed in orbit after the crash that happened that morning, could it have landed in Pennsylvania and he was able to determine absolutely not, made the statement for us that it is impossible that that could have been Cosmos 96. And the more interesting statement he made was that in fact there is no man-made object that came down over Pennsylvania at 5 o'clock on that day, there's no man-made object and he said that he has the databases and the knowledge to determine, even if it had been some kind of secret experiment he would be aware of it. He was also able to eliminate the project Corona which was a project that was dropping these canisters, it was sending out these spy satellites to Russia, photographing things from the sky flying back over the United States and dropping canisters which were then retrieved. Some people have thought that that might have been what it was, he was also able to eliminate that. Keen's work on retrieving official Kecksburg documents is truly fascinating. In the early 2000s working with the Coalition of Freedom of Information, CFI, Keen took legal action towards NASA for stonewalling files on Kecksburg and in 2007 she won. A settlement in October of 2007 required NASA to provide hundreds of never-before-seen documents to Keen and CFI while paying all legal fees. NASA's search for documents on the craft was completed by August 2009, where NASA posted 220 pages of Moondust documents with zero relation to Kecksburg. According to a NASA Public Affairs document, quote, NASA sent its files to the National Archives for Safekeeping two years after the Kecksburg incident. In 1996, the National Archives told NASA that the files had been marked as lost since 1987, end quote. We won't spend any time on Moondust, but if you have never heard of the program I highly recommend watching my video on Moondust which covers this program in depth along with its fellow programs UFO and Blue Fly, tasked with recovering descended foreign space vehicles during the Cold War. It is a very strange convenience that files relating to Kecksburg were lost forever. But let's explore what witnesses like Romansky, Bullybush, Betters, and myriad other witnesses describe crashing into the woods that cold evening. Many will remember when I covered this infographics crash retrieval operator video that contained a fascinating first-hand testimony. Very rarely do well-known UFO sightings describe a bell or acorn-shaped craft, certainly not one that is bronze, 10 to 12 feet high with strange writing along the base. But as it turns out, there are a wealth of similar sightings we can analyze. Let's take a look at this December 2, 1952 Blue Book case into Quincy, Louisiana, where multiple eyewitnesses observed an acorn-shaped object emitting pink, green, red, and yellow lights moving up and down in altitude for a period of two and a half hours. We can also analyze this November 10, 1956 Blue Book case in Massachusetts, where both civilian and military sources observed an acorn shape featuring a white base, red side, and green glow. Blue Book labeled this case as probably the planet Venus. On August 23, 1957, Blue Book reported a sighting of a bell-shaped object climb and move out of eyesight of observers in New Jersey. The case was explained away as a weather balloon from Philadelphia Municipal Airport. Around the time of Kecksburg, November 1965 to be exact, residents in Manhattan, New York reported to Blue Book of a bell-shaped UFO hovering above Manhattan during an electricity blackout. There are over half a dozen other Blue Book cases I can reference off the top of my head like a 7-8 foot bell changing colors in 1965 seen over Bunky, Louisiana. In the video description, you can find additional Blue Book cases featuring bell or acorn-shaped UFOs from 1957, 1954, 1965, and 1957. But I would like to draw your attention to a now-deleted Reddit entry titled, quote, I worked on a team that dealt with NHI technology and left in 2018, end quote. This alleged Reddit whistleblower is another in a long line of enigmatic, anonymous individuals who make astonishing claims on Reddit, 4chan, or other message boards before deleting their profiles, leaving users debating endlessly to the validity of their entries. I will save exploring this testimony for a full video as I find this post fascinating, but to summarize this post, the leaker became disgruntled and sought to vent about his career within an agency that dealt with issues related to non-human intelligence. One paragraph of this perplexing post caught my attention, quote, Later I worked in a facility, within a facility, just like the one I had tried to inspect. It stored a craft. Being near the craft for extended periods of time is extremely dangerous, especially if it is being experimented on with power. I didn't observe any injuries to anyone while I was there, but all sorts of long-term nasty injuries were relayed to me through rumors and warnings. The craft was shaped like a dreidel without the handle. There was a large exterior piece that went missing when it was recovered. The theory is it acted as a stabilizer, although some argue it was a crude weapon, end quote. Before we break this down, the anonymous poster also said, quote, The shape was directly informed by its purpose. Every shape is custom-molded in a metallic material that would revolutionize the way we travel if we had it, end quote. This method of molding sounds extremely similar to the statements of first-hand Kecksburg witness and machinist Jim Romansky. Discussion of peril to human bodies and cognition when in proximity to UAP is being heavily explored in 2024, and has even been mentioned in a graphic in Lou Elizondo's book Eminent. The craft description, a dreidel without its handle, sounds almost identical to the craft Romansky, Bully Bush, Betters, and others described. The Reddit user also states a large exterior piece went missing when the craft was recovered. While remember back to our 1965 fireball, witnesses discussed pieces falling off of the blazing fireball in the sky. Blue Book even claimed to have retrieved pieces of chaff from the object. Interesting, I am once again drawn to whistleblower Stephen Lovekin, who claimed a special classified portion of Blue Book had actually recovered debris from the Roswell wreckage. Lastly, the writing described as hieroglyphics reminds me of three other cases. The writing on the Roswell debris described by primary witness Jesse Marcel Sr. The writing along the lip of a craft craft, Danny Sheehan observed photos of, in the classified files of Blue Book while under order from President Jimmy Carter. And the writings that appeared to project off of what was considered recovered weapon technology by witness RA at the Offworld Technologies Division. I will discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker only briefly as I have already covered him in my majestic documents project with Ryan Wood and in my Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the UFO crash retrieval video. Robert Sarbacher, physicist and member of the U.S. Joint Research and Development Board named Dr. Eric A. Walker in an interview with Stanton Freedman, implicating Dr. Walker as an integral member to UFO crash retrieval and UFO study alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush. Dr. Eric A. Walker was the president of Penn State University from 1956 to 1971, a member of many defense boards including chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis and the executive secretary of the Defense Research Board from 1950 to 1951. Throughout the 1980s, Walker would be contacted by numerous UFO researchers, such as William Steinman and Habib Henry Asadahel, a pseudonym for Armin Victorian. Walker would confirm attendance at meetings centered on UFO crash and body retrieval efforts in 1949 to 1950, discuss the validity of MJ-12, comment on the difficulty of breakthroughs in UFO reverse engineering and make all sorts of cryptic statements on needing to understand ESP to become involved with UFO programs. Let's break down this conversation between Armin Victorian and Walker, where Kecksburg is referenced, and before we do an interesting note, primary Kecksburg researcher Stan Gordon did state there was a report of someone fitting Dr. Walker's description at the crash site. In the interview, Walker states he went to the Kecksburg crash site with two men from the military that were not on duty. He also went with a fellow colleague of his. When asked if it was a UFO recovered, Walker states, quote, I cannot comment on that. I cannot tell you, end quote. Walker would not comment on if he was at the crash site for long, but did state he and the other men did not prepare any reports. Two men from the military, but not on duty. So we can rule out here that these were the three USAF Blue Book personnel from the 662nd radar squadron dispatched to the crash site. Could Walker and his mentioned off-duty military companions possibly be the men in civilian clothes referenced by numerous eyewitnesses or possibly the men in trench coats who ordered Romansky and the firemen away from the UFO? And we must ask, why did Walker not prepare any reports? Can we take Walker's refusal to comment on the presence of a UFO as an admission that non-human technology did in fact crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania? And last part here, Walker mentions a colleague of his accompanying him to the crash site. In 1965, Walker was serving as president of Pennsylvania State University, a shadowy witness I covered and spoke to as TB. I highly recommend watching my UFO witness list redacted video to analyze his entire story. According to alleged emails with Dr. Stephen Greer, TB stated UFO program USAPs, unacknowledged special access programs, are embedded within UARCs, university affiliated research centers for the Department of Defense. As it turns out, Pennsylvania State University does indeed have a UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory for the US Navy. In fact, Walker would help create the Applied Research Center at the behest of the US Navy in 1945 following World War II, where Dr. Walker moved 100 engineers from Harvard to Penn State. Not only was this ARL awarded the largest research contract in Penn State history, $2.1 billion from the Navy. The ARL also currently specializes in prototyping novel power and energy systems, electrooptics and directed energy. Could Walker and his colleague have been tasked with investigating the Kexburg crash for UAP programs stemming from Penn State University's Affiliated Research Center, the Applied Research Laboratory? In his 2024 book Eminent, Lou Elizondo named Lyndon B. Johnson amongst Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Trump, as presidents who were briefed into sum to all of the UFO phenomenon. This statement by Elizondo plus his relationship with Dr. Eric Walker, who self-admitted he was present at the Kexburg crash, leads us to do some serious investigation into Lyndon B. Johnson, who served in office from 1963 to 1969. We can see in the luncheon in the White House, dated August 3, 1964, Eric A. Walker amongst other colleague presidents met with Lyndon B. Johnson. Walker was also the only university president to be invited by Johnson to attend the Clean Air Act signing in the White House in 1967. But we can also find a handful of letters between Walker and Johnson, such as this September 10, 1964 letter in which the president writes Walker thanking him profusely for his service as a member of the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Military Academy. Some unreferenced actions recommended by Walker were to be instated by the Secretary of Defense at Johnson's request. This report very well may have nothing to do with UAP, but Johnson and Walker were close enough to exchange personal letters. Let's also analyze the September 24, 1964 letter addressed to Dr. Walker from Johnson, Dr. Walker to personally recommend a university student to honor as a young leader. Or how about this May 18, 1966 letter dated after the Kecksburg incident in which Johnson again profusely thanks Walker for his service as a member and chairman of the National Science Board. One Dr. Hornig is mentioned here, pay attention to that name for later. In this letter, Lyndon B. Johnson cryptically says, quote, I should also like to thank you for the unstinting manner in which you served your government in other areas, including your recent tenure as a board of the Defense Science Board, end quote. Just how deep was this relationship between the president and a man associated with USG crash retrieval efforts? Johnson also had a provable interest in UFOs during his time in the U.S. Senate before his presidency. In this article titled, Lyndon B. Johnson Calls for UFO Alert, we can see Johnson attempted to institute a military subcommittee to report UFO sightings personally to him. Johnson even wrote to Major Donald Kehoe, an excellent ufologist and author of the Flying Saucer Conspiracy in 1960 thanking Kehoe for delivering documented evidence on UFOs. With all of this interest in UFOs and his relationship with the shadowy Dr. Eric Walker, what was Johnson doing during and after the December 9, 1965 Kecksburg event and how much did he know? In his 2024 release of all of his research files, Grant Cameron has supplied incredibly crucial documents discussing Johnson's actions and meetings around the time of the Kecksburg crash. Here we find President Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule for December 9 through the 11, 1965. Since the time of the Kecksburg event occurred around 4 to 5 p.m. Eastern Standard, we will begin to analyze late appointments on the 9th and meetings the following day. The evening of December 9, the President seemed to partake in many leisure activities, dinner, driving around the Texas White House, watching the evening news, etc. On the morning of December 10, 9.50 to be exact, solely an hour after waking, we see a massive roster of guests arrive for an exhausting day of meetings. The arrivals include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or JCS as I'll refer to them, the Secretary and Undersecretary of Defense, doctors such as the aforementioned Dr. Donald Hornig, high-up USG officials, NASA Director James Webb, and more. While no meetings this day make explicit mention of Kecksburg, Soviet spy satellites or ICBMs, every single one of these names offer crucial insight and a key piece to the puzzle of the Kecksburg mystery, and the possibility of a red-in President addressing a pressing UFO crash retrieval. Almost immediately upon the guests' arrival, the President began his meetings for over two hours from 10.10 a.m. to 12.51 p.m. Johnson met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bill Moyers, Joe Califano, Secretary McNamara, and Secretary Vance. There is a lot to break down here as each name warrants investigation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff include US Navy Admiral Donald L. McDonald, who was in 1965 serving as the Chief of Naval Operations in General Wallace M. Green, commandant of the US Marine Corps, not much to analyze about these gentlemen. But during LBJ's presidency, USAF General J. P. McConnell served as Chief of Staff for the US Air Force. Upon taking his position on February 1, 1965, he relieved General Curtis LeMay. If that name sounds familiar, we have discussed LeMay earlier in this video and at length as the General who denied Senator Barry Goldwater to the Blue Room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and congratulated Harry B. Cooper for his work on the quote-unquote UFO program. LeMay's ties to ufology are vast. Also among the JCS was US Army General Earl Wheeler, who sat as the Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, worth noting Wheeler shot to the top of the ranks of the US military without much combat experience, eliciting criticism from many including none other than General Curtis LeMay, who called Wheeler quote, Paulie Parrot, end quote. A small detail worth noting after the meeting all of the Chiefs of Staff took a car ride with Johnson, all but the under-qualified Wheeler. The last Chief of Staff present in the early meetings is General Harold K. Johnson, Chief of Staff for the US Army. Johnson spearheaded the Eighth Calvary Regiment, which in Vietnam was a component of the First Calvary Division. The division I suspected in the Infographics whistleblower video to contain the soldiers who witnessed the crashed UAP. These Joint Chiefs of Staff were all overly qualified to be associated with the program and briefed Johnson on the crashed UFO from the evening before, but this trail goes even deeper. As previously mentioned, including in the morning meetings were Bill Moyers, the personal assistant to Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, and Naval Veteran Special Assistant of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense Joe Califano. Califano would attend many of the meetings with Johnson the day of the 10th, but here let's make special notice to Califano's duty as a member of the Federal Radiation Council. Califano had a history of dealing with aerial collisions and crashes that required the Atomic Energy Commission's involvement, such as this December 4th and 5th 1965 case of a midair aircraft collision. What is interesting to note here is a subsequent off-record meeting with Califano and Buford Ellington, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning on December 13th, 1965, four days after Kecksburg. Why was this off-record meeting sent to Grant Cameron from the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum considered off-record? Following the JCS car ride excluding Wheeler, the guests engaged in lunch before Johnson met with McNamara, Vance, Bill Moyers, and Dr. Donald Hornig, as well as Secretary Orville Freeman. Donald Hornig served as Presidential Science Advisor to Johnson after also serving the late John F. Kennedy Jr. The Presidential Science Advisor was a position first held by Dr. Vannevar Bush to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. This should ring a bell to anybody familiar with the majestic documents. The last member of this post-lunch meeting included Secretary Orville Freeman, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture under Johnson from 1961 to 1969. Why would a former Marine and Secretary of Agriculture be present at a meeting with three Secretaries of Defense and the Science Advisor to the President? What is even weirder here is the presence of James Webb alongside an Undersecretary of Agriculture. I take you to July 9th, 1947, just two days after the Roswell crash, where James Webb, sitting as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, made late evening calls to Norris E. Dodd, Undersecretary of Agriculture. This may very well be a stretch here, but we must pursue all research angles, was Webb discussing the Roswell event with Dodd and do positions like Secretary of Agriculture entwine more with UAP programs than we might think. I won't spend too much more time on the meetings as we have already discussed the significance of most of the members in their grouping, and I have glossed over some of the other interesting players like Dr. Glenn Seaborg, who was a Nobel Prize winning chemist and atomic energy chairman, from 1961 to 1971. I could make an entire video on the significance of this day of meetings, but the JCS and every single individual summoned to Johnson's Texas residence the day after Kecksburg holds massive importance and possibly signifies a day of briefings and meetings on the crash. To further our investigation of Kecksburg, we can analyze multiple witnesses claiming to have observed the Kecksburg bell after it was dragged from the woods that cold winter night. One such witness contacted Stan Gordon before the airing of a 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast on Kecksburg and provided detailed information on his experience with the Kecksburg craft. According to this witness, as a member of the Air Force security team at Lockborn Air Force Base near Columbus, Ohio, he guarded the object on the early morning of December 10, 1965, after the object had been transported from Pennsylvania. According to this witness, after arriving on a truck, the craft was backed into a hangar and security was greatly tightened around the base. The object whose description matched the 10-12 foot bronze bell apparently stayed at the base only a short time the morning of the 10th, before being transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio. And we do have witnesses who claim to have observed the bell at Wright-Patt. This witness, Myron, first contacted Stan Gordon after the airing of the 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast and was interviewed and investigated by the legendary Leonard Stringfield. The trucker claimed the only reason he would discuss his experience was due to thinking, quote, it would be okay to discuss what he saw since it was now on TV, end quote. The word of Stringfield carries much weight for myself and others. And regarding Myron, Stringfield stated in UFO crash retrievals, the Inner Sanctum status reports six, quote, after a number of lengthy interviews and getting his testimony on videotapes at his home by a medical friend and research associate, Dr. Brian Thompson, I feel convinced of Myron's sincerity, end quote. Stringfield's analysis of Kecksburg would remain extremely balanced. We can take for example Stringfield's discussion of an insider known as Uncle, who spoke to Stringfield through an intermediary, as noted in 1993 status report three, amassing the evidence. Uncle told Stringfield he was on the right track with his research but cautioned of disinformation. Among Uncle statements were claims of understanding alien biological structures, that UFOs were of benign origin, and that the Kecksburg case involved a crashed spy plane, while the heavily contested Fort Riley and Johannesburg, South Africa crash cases were true. All this is to say that Stringfield did in fact note opinions against Kecksburg but still pursued the case for well over a decade. Anyways, back to Myron, as noted for the record by Stringfield, Myron stated he and his cousin, J.S., worked for a family owned shale and tile brick business in Ohio. Two or three days following the Kecksburg crash, the company was contracted for a large order of special glazed bricks to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The customer, the U.S. Navy, according to Myron, sent a representative to the business to select and inspect the bricks. Myron claimed receipts of this transaction were lost when the business was sold to new owners. The specialty brick in question was a, quote, double glazed engineered brick, end quote. Myron would later state the purpose of these bricks were to build a double thick, lead lined protective structure around the Kecksburg UFO to protect against radiation. The shipment of bricks was delivered at a designated gate where Myron and J.S. arrived in different flatbed trucks. Once outside Wright Pat, a two or three star general dressed in a blue uniform led the delivery men to a warehouse ahead. The destination for the bricks was a brick warehouse, 50 to 80 feet inside, accessible by a narrow blacktop driveway surrounded by rows of offices and a power plant. To quote Myron, nearby the building was a, quote, Army 35 foot long tri-axle lowboy that I later learned transported the object. A tarp was still draped over its midsection, end quote. Myron noticed four or five frantic personnel outside the building, equipped with white coveralls, visored headgear, rubber gloves and boots, and a Colt 45 pistol, quote, who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, end quote. From Myron's point of view, the people inside the warehouse were solely concerned about the object inside the building. The personnel and delivery men unloaded the bricks by hand from trucks to pallets where Myron noticed the men were navy, not air force by insignia on their uniforms. During a break from unloading the shipment, Myron somehow managed to approach the warehouse's door undetected and peer inside. He observed metal scaffolding around a large, strange object with men at work. Puzzling to Myron, parachute silks were suspended from the ceiling, partially enshrouding the object, lit by one floodlight directed downward. The object was bell shaped, measuring an estimated 10 feet tall and less than 10 feet wide, appearing metallic with a dull copper or bronze color, but was charred or covered in a sooty residue. During pursuing this mystery any further, irresistible, Myron asked one of the personnel about his use of an acetylene torch. Myron told Stringfield, quote, probably thinking that my presence there meant I had a proper clearance. The man who was wearing a visor told me he was trying to get inside, end quote. Myron further explained to Stringfield the man told him all attempts to gain entry failed, whether torch, diamond-headed drill bits, or acid. This reminds me closely of the testimony of RB I covered in UFO whistleblowers, too, who stated he guarded a hamburger-shaped saucer in 1963 for two weeks, where a science team tried and failed with endless methods to gain entry to the craft. Myron then went on to explain, quote, I was surprised when he told me that if there were bodies inside, they might be too hot for the mortician to handle, end quote. Bodies are always a contentious and interesting aspect of UAP retrieval. We will address this point shortly. Myron was then startled by the voice of a guard who said, forget what you've seen or will lock you up and throw away the keys. And we found the base, and they took us from the backside of the Wright-Patterson Air Base all the way through the main part of the base, out the other side, down Maple Street, to the old training center for World War II. When I walked in and proceeded, I seen the bell shape. It was sitting there on stelt, and it had a very big parachute or something draped down over the top with a light up underneath the parachute, trying to cover this thing up so no one could see it. And you could see a ladder leaning against the bell before they were trying to get into one of the openings. And the guard said that he wasn't allowed to be in here, but how, I've already seen everything in there. So it didn't bother me when he ran me back out. The spaceship looked like a large acorn, runs about 14 feet to the top and about 10 to 12 feet wide at the bottom with a collar on it that has writing on the collar. And it had a triangle on it, and it looked like the triangle was put on there with a welder by sticking the welder against the metal to shape the writing, and the writing was all the way around the bell shape of it. And the black, the bottom of the bell shape was completely black. And around the top of the edges was smoke covered, and the space thing looked like it was copper or bronze. Stringfield contacted Myron's cousin on October 3, 1990. J.S., as he'll be referred to, was reluctant to get involved due to family reasons. He did confirm delivering glazed bricks to right pat with Myron, remembered guards wearing protective clothing and a technician with a blow torch. When Stringfield asked J.S. if he had seen the craft in the building, J.S. stated, quote, I don't remember many details on that trip. My partner probably knows more because he was more inquisitive. Fast forward to 1991, Myron told Stringfield J.S. was willing to finally discuss his observations that fateful December day in 1965. On March 30 to April 1, 1991, Stringfield again interviewed J.S. J.S. told Stringfield a new story. He did in fact see the object the day before. He and Myron went to right pat. He had made the trip solo with an initial delivery of bricks and clearly recalled an object shaped like the Liberty Bell sitting upright under a tarp aboard a low-boy trailer. J.S. estimated the craft to be 8 to 10 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet wide, quote, I didn't ask any questions, but it probably arrived a short time before I did, end quote. J.S. discussed activity in the area. Men wearing fatigued suits and there were armed guards, but he didn't see anyone carrying any sort of rifle or machine gun. Unlike the next day's trip, quote, there was nothing unusual at the entrance gate. I gave the guard my identification and showed him my bill of landing and was directed to the area for unloading near the big red brick building, end quote. Like most cases, the discussion of bodies is the most controversial aspect of Kecksburg. In his appearance in the 2003 annual crash retrieval conference proceedings, Stan Gordon discussed the subject of bodies present at the crash. To quote Stan, in more recent years I have heard rumors that are not widely known that two small bodies were supposedly found at the impact location in 1965. I have generally accepted this as hearsay since there has never been any evidence to back up these claims. One such testimony actually came from Myron, the trucker we just discussed, who spoke to Gordon offering new details in 1998. In poor health, Myron agreed to meet with Gordon for a documentary Gordon was working on titled Kecksburg, the Untold Story. Stan says the two were discussing what Myron saw in 1965, Myron suddenly mentioned something which caused Stan and the video production crew to look at the man with astonishment. Myron added to his previous testimony delivered to Gordon and Stringfield, stating when he peeked inside the warehouse he observed the bell propped up by scaffolding, but he also saw a body lying on a workbench in the same room. Myron added this body was covered in a white sheet, measuring four to five feet tall. The only feature seen was lizard-like skin from a left hand sticking out from under the cover. I walked in the building and seen the bell shape there and they was working on it. I also seen an object laying on the workbench over there and the workbench runs about ten to twelve feet long and about thirty-two inches wide and about three foot, about thirty-six inches off the floor. I seen the left hand of every what was in there sticking out underneath of the sterile white pad and he only had three fingers, it was about four foot nine or four foot five inches tall if it was standing up, but it looked like it weighed about eighty pounds and it had dark green or brownish skin and it was just like a lizard. I have no doubt in my mind that the body laid on that table and the left hand of him was sticking out underneath of the white sterile pad that they had placed over him and he had the three index finger and his skin looked like lizard. I asked Myron why he waited so many years to divulge what he had seen in 1965. Well for the reason I never said anything before because Uncle Sam said if it were to ever leased out and they had to come and lock you up and throw the keys away or give you a bullet to satisfy you, no one will ever talk about it. Right now is the time to tell it before something drastic happens and my son, he is twenty-four years old and he said why are you going to do it now and I said well I may not live till tomorrow the next day to tell it so I'll tell it all tonight and be done with it. The only thing I've got now is a bad heart and high blood pressure and sugar and on oxygen once in a while and walking around taking nitroglycerin and all there is now I'm telling you now because I may not be here tomorrow. Why add this onto his story after nearly a decade after his initial testimony? Another witness Joel contacted Stan after hearing local news covering Leslie Keane and the CFI's attempts to pry free Kecksburg documentation. Gordon would meet with Joel at his home in late 2002, seeing Joel go back and forth on whether or not to proceed with the interview in fear of getting in trouble for what he saw. Joel claimed on the day of the Kecksburg crash he entered the woods to investigate the crash film. His attention was drawn to a metal object emanating bright clashes of colors like electricity. Joel hid in the woods to observe army and air force personnel, men in civilian clothing and men in suits and hats enter the crash area. Joel claimed to have observed an army general hop on top of the metallic object with a probe in his hand similar to an officer's billy club. The general smacked the object and the tool flew out of his hands. Gordon noted at this time Joel's expression changed to a far more somber and uncomfortable tone. Joel stated soon after striking the object a hatch opened that swung from right to left at the front of the object, accompanied by a whirling hissing sound. Joel described a scene what looked like quote two fingers in an unusually long arm and quote inside the hatch before it closed again. The concept of bodies may be supported by the testimony of Bill Weaver I mentioned earlier in the video. Weaver, a teenager, observed men exit a large light colored box truck in what he described as moonsuits. The men carried a box shaped device measuring four to five feet square resting upon a stretcher with four handles. A little while later there was a large truck pulled in, a light colored truck, a box van type. Out of it there was four guys come out. They had what we call moonsuits at the time. They were white cover all type suits. They took a box out of there, a box maybe four or five foot square. They carried down four handles and they carried that down to the object. About just right after that there was a military man. He came over to the car and he told us to leave and I got into an argument with him. I told him I didn't, you know, I wanted to stay, I didn't want to leave. He told me that he would confiscate my car if I didn't. What's going on everybody? It's UAP Gerb. Thank you so much for joining me today as we took a deep dive into the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash. Now, what would you say if I told you today we just started to scratch the surface of this case? Like I mentioned earlier in the witnesses tab, there are so many witnesses who have more to add to this story. The reason I covered Bulabush, Romansky, Betters, Weaver and so forth is because I think their testimonies offer the most complete picture and insight into the Kexburg story. There are other residents who talk about a military base being set up in a home near them, kind of like Romansky discussed in his interview on Montel Williams. There's other witnesses who talk more about the military presence and how it might have been obfuscated from a certain point of view when the military had reached up on Meteor Road and so forth. So there is just so much rich testimony to pursue. The Kexburg case has also seen so much coverage as we saw with Kexburg, the new Roswell, and Kexburg the Untold Story and Kexburg the Unsolved Mysteries episode in Stan Gordon's 1993 documentary. There has been so much coverage on this case. That is why I tried to take a more focused approach on breaking down the crash, focusing on a select few witnesses, focusing on the overall story, and kind of narrowing in on what happened to the craft, the bell, after the case, as well as focusing on Eric Walker and Lyndon B. Johnson. Now those of you familiar with the case will know there are a couple things I didn't discuss here. One of these was D. Glock, the alleged Nazi wonder weapon that was shaped the exact same shape as the Kexburg bell, a similar shape to the Liberty bell, and that is because I would like to cover that and cover sort of Nick Cook's work in the hunt for zero point and the Nazi connection to UAP in a whole nother video. I also left out claims of Kexburg and affirmation of Kexburg from the witness Clifford Stone who testified in the 2001 NPC conference under Stephen Greer. I did this because of course Clifford Stone carries with him a little bit of controversy so I want to analyze his claims and his merits before I put them into a Kexburg case in their own video. Now what were your favorite parts of this investigation? For me, I must say I just I adore Jim Romansky. I think he's an incredible witness, probably my favorite eyewitness of any case, the way in which he passionately talks about the case and any interview he has, especially Montell Williams. I really appreciate his demeanor, I think he offers valuable insights into this case and especially the Montell Williams show where he discusses kind of how his children faced issues with his experience at Kexburg. Also I hope everybody enjoyed kind of the oblique look into the blue berets. I think that's one of the most crucial aspects of this investigation. They need to be investigated much more and I will continue to do so over the course of my videos. Investigate there the incident Fort McGuire Dix as Leonard Stringfield supposed blue beret insider has claimed. Try to kind of focus in on the security police and Air Force police aspect of the blue berets and see if these guys might be used as a rapid reaction unit for kind of domestic or even foreign crash retrieval efforts. Also of course I've talked about it in many videos and he's a person I view a sort of a linchpin to the whole UAP phenomena, Dr. Eric A Walker. Of course in this video we saw, we talked about this in the Sarbakar video but we ran over his claims about saying he was in fact the Kexburg case and that he did know about Majestic 12 and Robert Sarbakar was correct in terms of Dr. Eric A Walker being a crucial member in UFO crash retrieval. But what was new to me here was the UARC the university affiliated research center in the ARL at Penn State University. I think there's some great connections there to explore and I will continue to do so as well. Also I found the Lyndon B Johnson connections with Dr. Eric Walker as well as Johnson's meeting scheduled the day after Kexburg fascinating. Now if you look in the show notes and you can also find these PDFs posted in my discord if you don't want to go to the link of Grant Cameron's files but you will see all of the files I reference because I really recommend following along. I just gave a brief sample of some of the content we went over in this video but there's pages and pages and pages of Grant Cameron covering this case. I also really recommend reading crash retrievals one through seven string fields work and seeing how he approached the Kexburg case over a span of ten years. It's really fascinating to see him kind of reference uncle the alleged insider he talked to a through a media intermediary with and just him a interview Pete who is now of course James Jim Romansky interview Myron and so forth speaking of Myron I find this witness so interesting. Initially I found it to be quite a red flag that Myron initially approached Stan Gordon in the late 80s and also spoke to Leonard Stringfield and it wasn't until 1992 1993 for Stan Gordon's newest documentary that Myron touched on the topic of bodies when he had only commented on what a personnel at the base had said to him before about it being a hot issue for autopsies. I think this case is a little different than something like the 1955 Del Rio case with Robert Willingham as Robert Willingham initially stated he saw no such bodies and then changed his tone in about the Jeff Rents episode maybe in 2008 2012 I want to say around the time of the the book by Noah Torres came out. Watching Myron was very interesting because that was a late pop up in my research seen his interview in the 1993 Stan Gordon documentary. He of course as he claimed felt much fear and that's why he kind of omitted the topic of bodies before now there are a couple other witnesses who claim or are adjacent to body claims here such as Don Sebastian I didn't cover him just because I didn't see how his story really really gelled with other witnesses because he described when he approached the scene and saw military men and was kind of hiding around observing the military operations he heard a loud scream from the forest no other individual in the present area has also admitted hearing this scream so I left that out what did you guys think of the Kecksburg case I want to know everybody's thoughts this of course is such a famous case of course I think it's pretty self-evident this crash case has something very tangible something that actually crashed in the woods in Kecksburg and this was not a meteor as Blue Book claimed I think the the discussion of the chaff discovered alongside the meteor where the Blue Book team from the 660 second radar squadron is extremely interesting I also am unsure about the claims of Soviet capsule or American capsule I think there's plenty of evidence and discussion to dispute the landing of a human-made space object I was really excited to relay this bell shape to the infographics whistleblower and that reddit whistleblower post all too often in crash cases we mainly hear about saucers or egg shapes so it's really cool to focus some attention on this kind of almost a liberty bell shaped craft with strange hieroglyphs hieroglyphic writings on it I think it's it's such a unique type of craft especially as described by many of the witnesses just big enough to fit an individual maybe two the off-white the off-yellow bronze-ish color and the fact this alongside other craft descriptions seems like it was made out of a single piece of metal like pouring liquid metal into a cast I love this case right now I lean towards this being a legitimate UAP retrieval case I think there's a lot of evidence here a lot more evidence that needs to be pursued of course the only thing missing from this case with all of the witness testimony with Johnson with Walker with with with all the witnesses after the fact is some official documents and those of course are very scant in this case because apparently NASA lost them in 1987 but again let me know what you guys think I want to appreciate every single person here watching this video thank you so much for giving me your time I can't believe you guys will sit through about an hour and a half I think at this time video please remember to leave a like and subscription means the most leave some comments let me know what you think remember guys I have a patreon I don't charge for any extra content I don't gate keep content on there only support what you think the channel is worth we got big things coming for the channel of course regular viewers will know that we're doing about one live a week I want to start doing some more interviews on the channel too I know right now that interviews I've had usually take three weeks or so to conjure up because there's so much editing involved I do want to do some pure interviews as well but of course I'll be in the lab working on my my interview skills because I can get very tripped up with my words as you all know but thank you so much for watching guys I will catch everybody on the next show thank you</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/rgBTMzFd-hg/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>ATIP</li> <li>Armin Victorian</li> <li>B.

So Voler Records recently, I would say, when did you start this, about August? About three weeks ago. Okay, he has put out an eight-part series now at this point that covers the relationship between UAP Legacy Programs, the Bush family, the 1933 Magenta Case, Dick Cheney, companies like EG&amp;G and the Carlisle Group, including a part eight that just recently came out. I haven't got a chance to read that yet, so we'll talk about that today. But the sort of the amount of research here and the quality of the posting is just so fantastic. I know he's worked closely with a lot of other people I've talked to, such as C. Britton in the chat, 363942, Max Parr, Kermit, all fantastic researchers. So Voler, if you'd like to introduce yourself a little bit and kind of tell us a little bit how you got into investigating the phenomenon and then how you said that all the talk of Dick Cheney being at the top of the UFO pyramid inspired you. I'd like to hear how you got into this subject in this specific research project. Sure, like a lot of folks been into this stuff since I was a kid, kind of terrified and fascinated at the same time, was buying books. I just turned 44, so I was of an age where it was like right when, unsolved mysteries and sightings and all the shows were coming out and growing up an 80s kid. Yeah, and I was buying books. I had a little section on my bookshelf of like UFO cases and stuff. And yeah, I never really lost interest but it kind of came and went in terms of intensity and yeah, we were talking right before we went live. I think in 2004, there was the famous case of the Mexican pilots, I'm pretty sure it was Mexico. And it's like the seven lights, craft, whatever that they see and that was a pretty big deal. And I think that was about the time that YouTube hit. And so that went pretty viral, you know, until the point that, you know, it was like Mexico and Venezuela and a few other central and South American countries. And I know it was Sweden and I don't remember who else but, you know, there was an attempt to building this kind of international coalition for transparency, you know, and of course, the United States didn't wanna have anything to do with it. And then, yeah, I mean, cut to 2017, we all know what happened there, you know, it was such a huge thing. And then in 2020, you know, with really nothing to do, you know, I was pretty involved with the protests and stuff. And I think once a lot of that started quieting down in the fall, I was just all in on this because everything else was so messed up, you know, it was just kind of like, okay, like we're in a pretty bad spot, you know, kind of all around. And so yeah, just a lot of my free time was spent, you know, watching stuff and listening to podcasts and just kind of soaking things in and, you know, we'll talk more about this, but I think a lot of this has been about, you know, normalizing a lot of this stuff. Yeah, I know we were talking about it a little bit and it's something that's featured heavily in your research, is kind of calling back to statements Grush has made, whether on his news nation appearance, whether at his congressional hearings. And it sounds like Grush was like a massive influence for a lot of your work. And would you say that, especially in July of 2023 with Grush on news nation, the Senate hearings, that kind of kickstarted you to research this in depth into a subject? Yeah, I mean, I would say I was already there, but definitely, I mean, that changed everything. Right. That was such a huge deal. I mean, Elizondo was a big enough deal. But yeah, Grush, I mean, Grush spun me out. You know, I remember I had a whole, the whole next day I was just like, in a weird haze almost, you know? And it was funny because I kept thinking things were gonna change right away, you know? And we're still here. I mean, the lots happened, but you know, I think so much of this has been about learning, you know, kind of the way Matthew Pines has been talking about it. You know, this sort of word of mouth desensitization and normalization and, you know, you can still kind of go about your day and, you know, I think because of the fluid nature of media now and the way that we consume it, you can very easily see some crazy UFO video and then keep scrolling Twitter or whatever, you know what I mean? And you're just like, oh, okay, that's pretty nuts. And then kind of move on, you know, to a degree. But yeah, I mean, I think, I'm not really sure. I'll say it was around, we were talking about this, but, you know, before we started recording, but I think it was around December that Ross Coltart did a talk at a library in Victoria in Australia. And at the very end, he mentioned EG and G. And I think it was JT4 and some other stuff. And I think that was when I got past the cool video part and started actually digging in to like, oh, we're talking about, you know, companies and organizations and agencies and this stuff, you know, this is a lot bigger. And I know there were people there before me, you know, it's funny now, going back, looking through Reddit and stuff, doing research where it's like, oh, people were there even before Grush, you know, they started digging in. But for me, it was kind of moving past some of the shock, I guess, you know, and getting to a point where it's like, yeah, this is more than real. It's like, there's just, the history of this is a lot bigger than I think any of us had realized. Yeah, and that's something I really appreciate about kind of your work in the eight parts we're gonna talk about. Videos to me at least mean very little. And I'm super vocal about this almost every video I do. It's kind of the hard nose paper trail, the official documents, the alleged documents, the alleged involvement of certain contractors and three little organizations that that's kind of the research avenues I like to go down to actually kind of move a conversation forward instead of just going in circles about some lights in the sky footage or and so forth. Right, because there's not that much to do with that necessarily. No, no, yeah. But that's why we're all here, you know, to a degree. So I'd love to just kind of dive into part one here because part one of your eight part series really starts to focus on the introduction of the Bush family and their involvement with the creation of the OSS, Alan Dolis and then 1933 Magenta, Italy, Crash Retrieval case, something I've covered a lot before. So I'd love to just kind of hear some summarization and points of that post. If you'd like to share your screen as well to kind of go through research, we can do that. Otherwise I can show some stuff because I think especially the base point here, part one is, is super consequential, especially with the implication of the Brown brothers and Harriman and so forth that I learned from your work. Oh, really? Yeah. So yeah, I having been so active on Reddit a few months ago, I think it was 363942 started a little private chat with a few of us. And that's when we started kind of bouncing things off of each other, you know, because really it was just them and Harry's white timeline. Right. Like I'm a, you know, I think in terms of narrative and a literal, you know, editing timeline, like let's start looking at it like that and it'll make it easier to piece this stuff together. So yeah, eventually, I mean, it really was just the last two or three months maybe that, you know, a lot of that, it was like, I was seeing Bush's name pop up in a lot of the earlier research. And then, you know, we kind of would all keep digging in different time periods and yeah, just started coming together more, you know, and the Brown brothers, Harriman stuff. I think we were kind of on that. And then I, it was really just a few weeks ago, you know, I've been watching a lot of the She-Han interviews and he had mentioned Bush a few times and there's the story of, you know, him or Carter, you know, bringing him in to brief him and Bush saying, no, and then I, one of the last interviews he did, got two weeks ago, maybe it was right before I started posting this. He pretty much spent his entire hour only talking about Bush. Yeah, that was the October 18th, year right to know interview, I believe so. It's one of his most recent ones. Yeah, maybe it was with, was that the one with Jeffrey Mishlove? Yes. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah. And that's where he really starts to dive into Bush. I think H.W. Bush as well was mentioned by Lou Elizondo as kind of having some sort of knowledge of UFO craft retrieval programs or just an estimate of the UAP situation. Yeah, I don't know if I saw that, yeah. But yeah, just kind of, this whole thing is so crazy, you know, I think a lot of these, I mean, these posts, I was just banging them out basically late at night. You know, I just take up for, you know, six or seven hours and just like, I feel so weird walking around with this stuff, you know, I have to get it out of my head. So how did you, sorry, I'll keep on Reddit here instead of Medium, because I'm not signed in here. How did you start to connect H.W. Bush and the Bush family to Magenta? Because Magenta, of course, is a case for anybody that doesn't know, is a case that occurred in 1933 in Magenta, Italy. It was a crash lenticular object that was taken in by Mussolini. Mussolini had theorized that this was an ally of experimental aircraft, American or British, but some of his engineers, such as the RB, why can I remember right now? The RB in a number thought this was sort of an NHI craft or early thoughts of this. And then eventually information was channeled to the Americans from Pope Pius, the I can't remember. And eventually in the Pius the 12th, and in the closing years and days of World War II, somehow the Americans were able to get their hands on this craft. So how the heck did you connect that with Alan Dolos and the Bush family? So really I have to give most of the credit to 36, 39 here and Harry before that, before he kind of dropped his mic on Reddit. Yeah, I think Dolos had been coming up a lot and I wasn't even that familiar with him. And so much of this has been a true history lesson outside of the topic, in terms of the inner workings of the CIA and all that stuff. And it's funny, I've been going back and kind of building, I've made a couple of supercuts last few days of times that Grush and other people will discuss this case. And he explicitly says, like the OSS retrieved this, when I was in the CIA, et cetera. So it was kind of put in our hands right away, but I think some of us had gotten there in a roundabout way in seeing Dolos pop up, and then learning about OSS, and then it was like the more it kept going back, and even towards the end of this kind of thread series, it was just like, this is so crazy. This is all one story. This is all like a small group of people. If you go back to Brown Brothers, Hairyman, it was Herbert Walker who was Prescott Bush's father-in-law. And Prescott Bush was H.W. Bush's father, correct? Right, so then it's Prescott Bush is running that company with Avril Hairyman. Later, Hairyman goes on to become, I think he's Eisenhower's secretary of state. He's calling a lot of shots in the government post-47. So it's the two of them at this agency. Eventually, Alan Dolos has lead counsel there. Some of these folks knew each other from Yale. There's a huge skull and bones connection. Yeah, I realized again towards the end of this, the skull and bones was a primary recruiting source for the CIA at the behest of Prescott Bush. Well, you really, I mean, we started to see how a lot of his power was very, very centralized within a small group of people. And that George H.W. Bush was eventually at the head of it. He's kind of brought him to the fold in the 40s after he graduated from Yale. Yeah, and H.W. Bush was as kind of a higher up in the CIA. He was kept under wraps for a while, right? Up until his almost presidential run. Right, and it came out in 88 when he was running for presidency. There was a paper called The Nation, I think it's a UK paper, and the journalist had found out that Bush had lied about how long he'd been in the CIA. He said he'd been brought in in 76 as the director, but really he was traced back to like 61. And apparently he was briefed about JFK within the week after the assassination. And then people have been commenting the last week or so. There's been some closer connections there possibly about him being in Dallas and taking a flight around and making some anonymous phone call and all this stuff. And yeah. So one of the things that really kind of part one of your research relies on is a book that She-Han was kind of advertising on his shelf during an interview. This book is called Nazi Hydra in America, Suppressed History of a Giant. And this was featured on his shelves. And throughout this book, this talks about how Prescott Bush helped like the Nazis ascension in kind of a, alongside the Brown Brothers and Harriman and so forth. So can you talk a little bit more about that, how Prescott Bush and the Bush family was actually kind of entwined with the OSS as well as Hitler's ascension and kind of the fascist party rise in the U.S. there in the 30s. Yeah. I mean, those guys helped fund the business plot in 33, which was kind of parallel with Hitler at the time, you know, and that they were trying to basically overthrow FDR after he was inaugurated and install, you know, a fascist dictator. And that failed, you know, sort of Hitler's plan. And eventually, yeah, they all forget some of the details cause a lot of worries, Rushdale. But, you know, those guys were at the core of banking and Wall Street and the steel industry and shipping and a bunch of stuff. And yeah, they were actively funding the Nazis. And set up a separate bank basically, specifically for that, you know, and they got in trouble for that later. But it was all the same people, you know, it was Prescott Bush. I think, I don't think Harryman was involved with that. You know, I think he was actually pretty upset because he was Jewish. Or he was Jewish or his wife was Jewish, but he went to Germany and came back and forced his brother to close their office in Hamburg once he saw what was happening, I think in like 35 or 36. So one of the players you also talk about on the American side of things, of course we talked a little bit about Prescott Bush, George H. W. Bush, we'll talk more about Alan Dolis, but is James Angleton, who later on in his life became an OSS agent. This was the kind of intelligence organization that preceded the CIA. Angleton was a child in 33 living in Magenta, Italy. Was he not? He was in Milan. He was like three miles away. He was in Milan, three miles away. Yeah, so possible they were first hand witnesses or they definitely heard about it. And he was the youngest agent under Bill Donovan at the time, right? Yeah, he was like 16 or 17, yeah. So of course, now with these early days, have you been able to make any connections with specifically Dick Cheney and kind of the Bush legacy of the Magenta crash? Only in that Prescott was there. Like Prescott for sure knew about it. And you got Dolis, Donovan, Angleton. Most of these people were Yale. It's like the whole Bush family was Yale, Skoll and Bones. Angleton was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones. Donovan was Yale, maybe Skoll and Bones. Dolis, I forget. But they were all part of the same like white elite, university dudes who basically formed the OSS. Right, because of 36, 39, 42, some of the crux of his research in the Magenta case is analyzing Alan Dolis and the good old boys and how they arranged the intelligence to kind of get the UFO out of, whether it was Germany or Italy at the time, but post World War II, specifically revolving around Alan Dolis. That's how most of his research applies. And I find it really interesting, you were able to bring Skoll and Bones into this. If any of you don't know Skoll and Bones, especially for our European audience, Skoll and Bones is a US based secret society. Think of in the early 2000s when Alex Jones infiltrated the Bilderberg group. Skoll and Bones is a Yale society. Who knows what they get up to? I think there's rumors that they burn like an owl effigy or just do very strange stuff. But throughout, it's so strange, but you were able to connect, let me find some of these members. You were able to connect guys like Alan Dolis, George HW Bush, Prescott Bush and so forth to this secret society. How does, would you say Skoll and Bones relates to kind of OSS, CIA and legacy possible programs? I mean, I guess, you know, because it just so happened that it was those guys that were coming out of, you know, not just that university, you know, but that specific, you know, secret society fraternity, whatever you want to call it. And then those were the guys that formed the OSS, you know, and then in 47, those were the guys that formed the CIA post Roswell. So it was kind of like they've been in on this the entire time. Especially cause there's one individual here I'd like you to expand on a little more, Richard Bissell, who declined to be in the Skoll and Bones, but by this I can assume he attended Yale. Tell us what, so tell us what he said to Harold Malmgren, former president, daughter, father, presidential advisor and very, very senior member, Richard Malm, Harold Malmgren, sorry. Right, right, right, yeah. I mean, that was really new to me, you know, I know that went pretty viral, you know, at least in this community when he tweeted that out, but yeah, I think he said in 63 that Bissell had told him, you know, about it an exotic, you know, reverse engineering program, and the era of, yeah, NHI, you know, tech basically. And then it turned out that, yeah, Bissell was at Yale at the same time. He declined to be part of Skoll and Bones, but his brother was in it. So there's a good chance he knew those guys back then as well. You know, he was brought in, I don't know his history, I haven't read that into it, not much into it yet, but you know, in 47, he's asked by Avril Harriman, a brown brother's Harriman to basically run the Marshall Plan and go over to Europe, talk them into borrowing money from the US, you know, for reconstruction. And so you start to see that Bissell, you know, becomes this new figure at the heart of this, you know, and in 50, at some point, he's working for the CIA after that. And I think it's in 54 that he decides that Area 51 is gonna be a good spot to test out a new aircraft. Right, Bissell, yes, that's a great point. Bissell proposed the site of Area 51. Right, right. And Bissell told Malmgren, I think the exact quote was of like an other world technologies. That's right, yeah. I know that phrase very well, because of course I have covered an alleged off-world technologies division, and when Malmgren made those outstanding statements, I can't tell you how many people kind of sent me screenshots of that tweet. Oh, really? So he set up the space for Area 51. Right. And then... Oh, sorry, go ahead. Quick with Bissell, I just, I don't remember. I know I think I had included it, you know, it's kind of at the tail end of things, but so 54, he decides on Area 51, 55 versus, I think it was 55. He brings the plans for the U-2 to the Air Force and they turn them down. And so he has CIA pilots test flying the U-2 in Area 51. Right. And what's interesting about that is Area 51 and the U-2 program out of Area 51 was also sponsored by, that remote detachment was sponsored by Edwards Air Force Base, California, who was also laterally connected to reverse engineering programs. Right, okay. That's also a very interesting point. So you have in your timeline here, kind of starting in the 1930s with Brown Brothers and Harriman and Bush families and how the Bush family helped Hitler rise to power, but was also instrumental in forming the OSS. You mentioned the Roswell crash in 1947. Come 1948, you mentioned a company called Dresser Industries. How do they play into this? Oh man, yeah, this was huge. This kind of, yeah, this tied everything together later on. So Dresser Industries was a company that was bought by Prescott Bush and Alan Dulles, I think. And they used that company to start Zapata Oil in I think 51 and they put George H.W. in charge of that. And so this is where a lot of the things where it's like, oh, okay, the same people that have access to this exotic tech are the same people who started Big Oil. So they're running things in all directions at the same time. And they're also, of course, directly involved with the CIA. So you can start to see that these things are all part of the same story. That's something that, although he's quite controversial, that Steven Greer talks about quite a bit. I know in his redacted witness list, he has witnesses from companies that I'm highly suspecting or something like a general electric who talk about knowledge of suppressed kind of exotic technologies to kind of reinforce the oil industry and continue dependence on oil and so forth. Oh, interesting, okay. As well as other companies like AT&amp;T and Bell Labs. So Greer talks a lot about kind of tight energy and oil tycoons having knowledge of exotic technologies, but continuing the suppression. Oh, interesting. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, this is when, you know, things start getting really crazy because you start to realize like, cool, this is just kind of one empire that's been running the whole show. You know, and as far as dresser industries in the 90s when Cheney, oh, there's so many players now I'm gonna forget. That's all right, there's so many people. Cheney was secretary, Cheney was secretary of defense for Bush. Is that right? Yes. But George HW and at the same time, they're making oil deals and arms deals and stuff. And he's doing stuff with Halliburton. And then after George, after Bush loses, I think Cheney goes in a private industry for a little bit. And in 98, Halliburton merges with dresser industries. So that's when you start to see these like legacy families come together, you know, the Bush empire that had been going on for decades. And then this new Cheney empire that started, I don't know, I guess in the 80s, you know, maybe there's more business dealings before that, but you start, you know, and you see in 98, like that's when they joined forces, you know, before the election. That's fascinating, research trails like that just kind of uncovered. I'm astonished you were able to pick on some of these intricacies like dresser industries and so forth. Oh, it was so crazy. Because every, I mean, you know, again, I was just staying up late and doing this and it was really hard to keep track of it all, especially because I was writing it out, you know, kind of as I found it, you know, because it was still astonishing. And I was worried if I didn't get it all down and post it, I'd forget it because I was just, there was so much information involved, you know? So that's why I actually started this, the night that that tweet about Cheney came out because I was like, oh, okay, this is, there's something really, really here then, you know, I have to really get this out of my head and get it all down. And yeah, just the more I kept digging, it was just like, oh, like every time, every single time I was writing these out, you know, I was just like, this is all completely insane. Now, I find it so interesting. What was the interview in which the interviewer states that Grush said that Cheney sat on top of the pyramid? What, who was the interviewer? I can't remember the show. I was Walter Kern. Walter Kern is, I think, the editor, editor-in-chief of the County Highway, which is the new print-only newspaper that came out last summer. And I think the second issue did that interview with Grush that I didn't know about till a few months ago. And then, of course, there's the 2000, 2001 radio show in which a researcher, Grant Cameron, who from a presidential UFO called in, asking Cheney about programs. And Cheney said, if I was briefed into one, it'd probably be classified and I couldn't talk about it. Right, right. And I might have forgotten to include it, but four years later in 2005, there's a story I found from the Herald Tribune where Cameron was trying, I think he was trying to fly, he flew into California to attend some UFO convention or something. And I think he wanted to try and track down Cheney and custom stopped him and they made him go back to Canada. Oh, I haven't read that. Yeah, I might have forgotten to include that in the post, but, so yeah, I mean, Cameron knows a lot of stuff, you know, obviously. Have you had a chance to dive into his file base? I used a lot of his internal research files for my Kecksburg research. No, I feel like I'm actually behind on a lot of people as far as the stuff goes, because it's like, I think we're all just consuming different things at different times. And then, you know, that's when we start to kind of boltron it all together. Right. You know, because that's, it's just so big. You know, and I think that's the point, you know. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself there. Cameron has, I think he posted a picture of his office before he uploaded all of his documents and he had an entire office filled with just papers. I don't scratch the surface of going through his files on Eric Walker, Lyndon B. Johnson, and kind of James Webb. So there is so much more to go. I don't even know how any of those people are involved. Yeah, so. So let's, now let's hop on to part three. A part three and four, I think we're actually combined, right? Yeah, I posted them. I think I was having trouble. I was posting too soon or something. Oh, OK. Yeah, because I got, I saw one post was wrong. And I just, I wrote them both pretty quickly. So in part, what was the crux of kind of part four that you were talking about? You mentioned a lot more on the players of Alan Dolis, his death, you were talking a little bit about Gerald Ford, which was pretty interesting, the church committee, and so forth, a little bit about Cheney and Rumsfeld. So what was a little bit of the crux of your research here in this part? Yeah, I think that was, yeah, again, I mean, these were almost extreme of consciousness. I don't really remember exactly. Right. I think it was tracing back how everybody knew each other and knew probably about this subject. And so you've got Nixon, who was Eisenhower's VP. And Eisenhower, very famous stories about him and possible meetings and agreements and stuff. So of course, Nixon probably knew something too. And then I'm forgetting exactly, but I think it was in the 60s that Ford and Cheney and Rumsfeld first all met working. Whatever they were doing, I forget exactly now. But those guys go back to the mid-60s, basically. And then in the 70s, when Ford takes office after Nixon resigns, he installs Bush, a CIA director, following the church committee. Basically, the CIA was in shambles post-Watergate. They were completely busted. And so they installed Bush. After Bush has had this very strange career of having, I think he was in office for two years as a senator or something. And then he's the envoy to China or ambassador to China and some other cushy role and just kind of strange stuff there. And then so at that time, you've got Ford, Bush, Rumsfeld was, I forget, like Secretary of State maybe for Ford. And then Cheney becomes White House Chief of Staff, if I remember correctly. Right? Yeah, I think Cheney was a staffer for Rumsfeld. And so then when Rumsfeld is given the role of Secretary, if I think it's Secretary of State, he recommends that Cheney take over as Chief of Staff. So you've got all of these guys. You've got Bush, Ford, Cheney, Rumsfeld going back. And then here you talk a little bit also about Jimmy Carter and also his involvement with Sheehan, which I found so interesting. Because of course, before he took office, Carter was pretty outspoken about UFOs and wanting to investigate the situation because he had his own personal siting. And then while he was president, Carter wanted to move a little bit off of oil and so forth. And according to Sheehan, I've talked about this a few times, Sheehan was sent by Jimmy Carter to access the classified section of Blue Book files. And that is where the infamous story, he saw a photo of a crash retrieval with symbols drawn on it. You mentioned Michael Schrat's drawings of those. I kind of wanted to bring those up too while we discuss this incident because this is great. So Michael Schrat, I think, held a drawing competition for the alleged. Crash that Sheehan discussed. And I think this was 79, right? 79? No, it's a 77. So the story that Sheehan has been telling is that I think it was like nine days after Carter was elected. That was kind of a prime interest to him. And he summoned Bush down to his home at Savannah. And just asked him, like, cool, what's going on with this UFO stuff? And Bush told him, like, I'm only going to tell you if you keep me on as director. Carter said, no, it's fine. So he ousted Bush when he took office and then had Sheehan go into the Blue Book. However, that worked out. He actually got in and found this photo and made that drawing and everything. And then there's the famous story, of course. I don't know if this is validated or not of Jimmy Carter receiving some sort of briefing to some extent on UFOs and basically was left in a catatonic crying state. I don't know if that story's been substantiated or not. I mean, that's I'm looking into that. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty popular. And I think, oh, man, I forget. Somebody had commented recently that, yeah, one of those other guys may have been like in the room when he got that. OK, I forget who exactly. And I don't know if I put it in any of the threads. I think it was after I wrote all of this stuff. But yeah, I mean, if you look at the 77 timeline, so he so Bush is out as director. And Carter does away with the Atomic Energy Commission. There's some other particulars yet. That splits into the DOE and NNSA. A lot of people don't look at records or pay attention to the NNSA. They only pay attention to the DOE in regards to legacy programs. However, especially back in the 80s, NNSA was a cataloging reports of UAP over nuclear sites throughout the US. Oh, interesting. OK, I didn't know that. So sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. You were talking about 1977. I mean, I think what makes sense to me is that he goes to Bush, gets denied, Bush is out. He does away with the Atomic Energy Commission, I think, in like right away, February or March. He has she and go in. I forget. I think that might have been March as well. I think Carter gets briefed in May or June, and then immediately signs into law the DOE. And the DOE becomes established in mid-August, I think. And so it's like, who knows this tech exists? He's coming off of the oil crisis. I'd done it for a completely different project years ago. I did a lot of research into that stuff, OPEC and all that. So I think there's a very clear timeline in that Carter knows this is all real, and he knows we can be doing something better and we can be off of oil. But I think the grand irony is that he establishes the DOE, which is set up at the James Forest Hall building of all places. And then they use the DOE just to keep hiding all the same stuff. Right. Yeah, of course, in 54, there's the Atomic Energy Agreement, which to this day keeps materials from ever being declassified UAP materials as they can be misclassified as transnuclear foreign material. And then, of course, the DOE and NNSA have other regulations. So I was surprised to learn in one of my recent projects was of some of the hypothetical reverse engineering and craft programs out at Nellis Area 51 and so forth, that DOE owns much of the land there in the Nevada test and training range. Right. And yeah, I learned a lot of that recently, too. I think they also own the land at Los Alamos. And so that's kind of this weird deal where they own the land, they lease it to the contractors, and I think also to the military. And so they are kind of the umbrella over a lot of this stuff. And I don't understand like what it means if they, you know, was admitted by, was it Stephanie Granholm? I think so. With a, you know, Birchhead and Luna Cornerher, you know, make her admit that the DOE works with JSOCs in times. And his famous story of the firefight between JSOC and Lockheed, and Coltart even validated that a couple of weeks ago and said, yeah, that might not be the only one. So I'm still kind of making sense of a lot of that stuff. The DOE to the contractors and the military. But then the, how does the DOE then have its own retrieval team apart from those people? Yeah. And I think that retrieval team is likely the NEST teams, something I've talked about a couple of times in the Jonathan Waygant story. Have you heard of NEST? Yeah. The Nuclear Emergency Search Team. So one of the interesting things is, guess which company NEST is? One of the contractors NEST is housed out of EG&amp;G, which we'll talk about in one second. So DOE has even more ties, because I can't wait to launch into this part, because this is where I think I can add a little bit of really interesting pieces. Tell me how the heck you connected EG&amp;G and the Carlisle Group into this, because the Carlisle Group especially, I don't think nearly enough people talk about. And once we talk about that, I'm going to give a, I'm going to connect Carlisle Group to modern day disinformation with Sean Kirkpatrick. So that'll be a bit fun. Okay. I've been curious like where they stand now. Okay. So yeah, it was when Ross gave that talk and ended it with bringing up EG&amp;G. So EG&amp;G was a high speed photography company, run by three guys. Like those were their initials, funny enough. And they were brought in to film the nuclear test. And I think it was also because of them probably that they were catching, you know, the craft or orbs or whatever was showing up around these test sites. And who knows what else they caught. And then post-Roswell, you know, I think it was, there was like December 47 at the behest of the military. They were basically asked to become, I'm forgetting now, like a joint enterprise or something so they could be contracted out. However that stuff all works. And so it sounds like basically they became the lead contractor. Like they were where things went, partly where things went private kind of right away. That the military could do what they wanted, but all the paperwork was at EG&amp;G basically. And and then, you know, wherever people will stand on the czar and all that, you know, I think it was Bob Echler, you know, who said back in the 90s that EG&amp;G was his employer. They are basically the employer area 51, you know, and they run Janet Airlines. You know, it's like they kind of run a lot of that show. Which that that confirmation of EG&amp;G working or employing people at area 51 was later confirmed and who we'll talk about in a second with Eric Tabor and his Aero testimony. Oh, interesting. Okay. I'm not familiar with that. EG&amp;G also interestingly enough, as I'm sure a lot of people know, is the parking lot where Admiral Thomas Wilson and Eric Davis met for the classic Wilson Davis notes, which is great. So you here in this post connected Ross Colthardt. And we kind of started off talking about this within this engineering badge from area 51 here. What did you take away from this? And then we'll talk about Eric Tabor, who this was his patch from his great, it was from his great uncle, I believe it was. Oh, right. Is he the guy? That's right. Okay. I think he saw it and then after his uncle died, like his uncle told him a story or something. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. This is again, you know, when I first saw this Colthardt straight up says like, oh, the internet's going to go crazy over this. Right. And I don't remember really seeing many people talk about it at all. No. So I posted it back then, just like, what does anybody think this means? And people just came at me for getting the Star Trek references wrong. Oh, really? And I was like, Star Trek, take, take, take their stuff seriously. Yeah. I mean, sure. You know, it's just like, that's a very ancillary part of this. But he does say that, you know, that I forget what it is. It was at 1-1-0-0, 1-0-0-1. Yes. So it's a reference to a specific next generation episode about the binars who steal. I watched it a couple of times after I read this, the binars who steal the enterprise to go help their planet or something. And it ends with like, why didn't you just ask us for help? Right. And I think it's like Picard and I'll get the other guy's name wrong. They're like, oh, we didn't, there was some, yeah, I think they asked the binars, like why didn't you just ask us for help? And they're like, oh, we didn't know if you would. So we just kind of, you know, did things on our own. So I don't know. I mean, maybe that's part of the story that some faction of NHI or something are, you know, getting help without our agreement. Or I don't know. I really don't know, you know, and then, but I did see digging into this more than Measure Analyze Protect. It might have been C. Britton or somebody else who'd found that that phrase comes up a lot in a lot of the DOE. So for anybody watching that doesn't know the story of this patch, this originated from Arrow Whistleblower who conveniently wasn't mentioned in the historical report. Eric Tabor, who I think in 2023, he testified to Arrow that his great uncle, I think his last name was Eurekart or something, he worked at Area 51 in the capacity of a sergeant from 1997 to 2014 as the head of security for like a radar cross-section facility at Area 51. And here he was privy to like images and photographs and so forth of a classic egg-shaped craft that according to what the uncle told Eric Tabor was just found abandoned in the desert. So supporting kind of the donation theory that Grush talked about, a seamless egg-shaped craft, maybe the size of a family car. Let's see if we can find an image of it because I actually have the article pulled up here and I'm sorry for the Daily Mail's ad pop-ups. I don't have an ad block right here. Yes, I use this image quite a bit. This is Eric Tabor. What year was that? His uncle, Eric Tabor, testified in 2023. Sam Yerka, I cannot pronounce that last name on the fly, was an Area 51 contractor from 97 to 2014. And Tabor is like an aerospace engineer, pretty well respected. Sorry, let me find images of that patch. Yeah. Wait, did he say when he saw that craft? No, I can't remember. He didn't give an exact date during the time. But of course, Tabor says his uncle was a contractor at Area 51 on the behest of EGNG. Which is to me part of, I mean, every now and then there's some kind of cosmic humor in this that you've got, you know, an egg-shaped craft at, you know, EGNG facilities. Oh, okay. So actually, maybe we do have a date. He said when he first got there in 1997, I had a personal conversation with a senior EGNG engineer whose group was tasked with trying to reverse engineer an object that was brought there by some CIA people in the 1980s. Which that's interesting to me because that might talk about the CIA and CIA, OGA and JSOC participating in retrievals even before kind of the start of the OGA in 2003. Right. 2002, 2001. But that of course is for foreign retrieval. So who knows who knows what kind of a retrieval the CIA may have had their hands in. Yeah, eventually. Do you know when and I was trying to find this the other day when in 2003, OGA became its own agency? No, I'm trying to think back to Chris Sharpe's reporting. But I can't remember exactly when I don't know if a date is listed there. Because I, yeah, I think it's, well, you haven't read part eight yet and that's when things get really fun. Okay, okay. So we'll continue on so we can get to part eight. Now, one of the companies that ran EGNG from 1997 to 2001 that you bring up is of course the Carlisle Group. The Carlisle Group has been implicated many times as one of the lead proponents of the control group of the UAP topic. What did you find out about the Carlisle Group within this within this piece part five? Oh, man. I'm not sure how some of that info was divvied up between these. Yeah, it just really stuck out to me that they were so they make a they made a deal in 96 with the Saudis, Saudi royalty. And that money goes back to the Bush family back to at least 51 with Zapata oil. So those guys have been working together a long time. And I think over time, EGNG kept getting split up into like different not branches, but like different subholding companies or something. Right. And so it just stuck out that you've got, you know, Carlisle, it turns out that their board was Bush, his secretary, State James Baker, UK Prime Minister, John Major. Oh, really? I didn't know that. Carlucci, who was part of his staff. And I'm forgetting another guy who was part of his staff. So it was like Bush and three of his top White House people all basically at the head of Carlisle Group alongside billionaire and chef Rubenstein. Right. So in 1987, David Rubenstein, he was the domestic policy advisor to Carter when he started the Carlisle Group. That's right. And that's funny. You mentioned Frank Carlucci. I need to know if one of my guys Kai is in the chat right now. Kai is really big into the subject of ARV as Greer puts it. And that mention of Frank Carlucci, if he's here, I need to bring something up to him real fast because Frank, the specific mention of Frank Carlucci with the Carlisle Group is what I think is one of the most consequential mentions here. I know it's, I know it's like a one sentence thing when you got heavy hitters like Rubenstein and the Bush family and the dozens of Saudi investors within Carlisle Group. But how familiar are you with the Mark McCandless story? And Kai, if you're in the chat, please comment because I know you're going to love this. Maybe if I got a refresher, I feel like the name sounds kind of familiar, but yeah. Okay. So Mark McCandless was an aerospace illustrator who testified at Greer's disclosure project briefing in 2001. Mark McCandless did tons of aerospace work, was a very well respected artist with Lockheed Martin various defense contractors. In 1988, his fellow aerospace illustrator, Brad Sorensen invited Mark McCandless to go to Norton Air Force Base, California for an air show. McCandless had some last minute projects for, I think it was popular mechanics, so he ended up not going. Brad Sorensen, when he went to Norton Air Force Base, saw the air show saw some experimental craft, but he was with an individual that he described to Mark later on. And this individual and Brad Sorensen, allegedly, but I think this is far more than just an alleged story because I'm going to cover it in the near future and I have some additional info on this story. I think people might find interesting are taken to a kind of wardened off section of this air base at Norton and admitted by a general or a three, I think it was a two or three star general Air Force general. And the individual that Brad Sorensen is with says that Brad is eight, so they can get in here. There are three flying saucer craft referenced as alien reproduction vehicles. This is where the term is coined. They function off of electrogravity or zero point technologies. They're the they're the classic flux liner design, if you've ever heard of that. Yeah, it's a it's three craft sizes, the smallest one being like 40 feet across, the largest one being like 100 200 feet across, all with similar designs, all with oxygen tanks sitting radially in the crash all craft all with like capacitor plates on the bottom, all with a crew compartment with I think three seats facing around each other. This is a very interesting story because McCandillish made a new let me pull up the drawing of the flux liner just so people can see this while I talk about it. So one one funny thing to kind of backtrack a tiny bit about the Watertown stuff is that that was one of the locations at Area 51. And there's a very specific EG&amp;G office that is opened on July 24, 1969, the day the astronauts come back. Oh, interesting. Office gets established. And then later, I don't know the timeline here, but later, the DOE is at that exact same address. Interesting. Yeah. So the the point I bring up about the ARV Mark McCandillish and Brad Sorenson is because that senior advisor that took Brad to this classified section of this air show was none other than Frank Carlucci. Oh, wow. So that's a really, really, really damn interesting connection because Carlucci is associated with Carlisle Group. Wait, what when was the November 13, 1988. So a year after Carlisle Group is formed. And of course, Mark McCandillish was unalived in 2021. Wait, what's so what's his story? I'm so as an aerospace illustrator after he was talked to by Brad about these designs, he and Brad worked for concept art for the ARV craft. Over time, he would talk about these craft and zero point systems until 2014, a documentary filmmaker named James Allen made a documentary called him called like zero point Mark McCandillish. Towards before the inner before the documentary was ever released, James Allen was diagnosed and killed by a super aggressive form of cancer within the span of weeks. And in his autopsy report, he was also found to have suffered from metal poisoning, heavy metal poisoning. About this same time, Mark McCandillish said he slept with a gun under his bed out of fear for his life. In 2021, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. I think I just heard this the other day or maybe he was catching up on your last on your episode from last week. That's right. I think we talked about that in live a little bit. Yeah. So Carlucci and the Carlisle group may be may be entwined with reverse engineering practices. And how this goes further is you, you're probably pretty familiar with Sean Kirkpatrick, right? Yeah. Do you remember in 2022, 2023, I can't remember exactly when when Arrow did a round table talk with Sean Kirkpatrick and former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie. Yeah. I think I watched that when it came out, but I don't remember any of the details really. So Moultrie was like a huge big wig. It was here. The two said there was nothing to UAP. There was absolutely nothing. Well, Moultrie, as it turns out, sorry, let me reference my notes. Moultrie is a board member for the Better Angels, which was funded by David Rubenstein, the founder of Carlisle Group. And he is a board member in iCapital, which is Carlisle Group's most invested in group. So even Ronald Moultrie now has connections to Carlisle Group. Ronald Moultrie has had influence, or as in cahoots with Sean Kirkpatrick previously as well. Right. Okay. So I found that all with the DOE since he was like 17. So I found that, and then of course goes to Oak Ridge, National Labs, once he leaves Arrow. Well, yeah, I mean, Oak Ridge is the entire loop. Yeah. So just said Vannevar Bush, you know, and I think he got the directions to do that in 41 from FDR, sets it up at 42. Whatever the timeline there is for MJ12, you know, and Vannevar Bush and everybody else. And then now we're right back to the DOE and Oak Ridge. Kirkpatrick goes there. And yeah, I just found, I was so happy when I read part five, just with EGNG and so forth. I love that because I think those, so I think those corporations are, EGNG has had some fame because of its association with Bob Lazar, but especially the Carlisle Group. I was so happy you made these ties here. Yeah. And that was, you know, I tried getting there months ago, you know, but I was still just wrapping my head around everything that was coming out. And that was actually where I wanted specifically to get back to. I didn't even intend to make this huge like series or whatever, you know, I was like, oh, let me just get back to the Carlisle, EGNG stuff. And then everything, it was like, as I kept digging, it was like, everything kept growing really fast. Oh man, okay, this is all huge. This is all one story, you know. And then of course, things get even bigger when we get to part six, where you mentioned SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation. Now, did you get a chance recently to see Kermit's post on kind of the financials of UAP legacy programs? And he talks about the startup of SAIC after various SEC regulations, which basically allow corporations to keep two books, one on record, one off record and so forth. No, I didn't see that. No, it's a wonderful piece. It harped back to, I think there was one interview in 2021, Lou Elizondo talked about, he referenced two defense contractors under the pseudonyms company A and company B, and them gaining unfair advantages within the SAIC, I mean, SEC, due to having exotic technologies. Right. Okay. Yeah, I mean, the SAIC stuff, I only really know about because of a still chill drill. They like focus specifically on that eventually, and looking at a lot of the records and stuff. And then going back and forth, we were, again, figuring out timeline, where it looks like basically blue book closes at the end of, I think Alan Dulles dies in January 69. Yeah. And then by the end of the year, blue book closes. And in that time, I've not, I've been able to find an actual month. But at some point, SAIC is started. And so it looks like basically that's where blue book maybe goes private. So now I have a way to circle back to your research as well, kind of with SAIC and Malmgren. And sorry, I'm forgetting his name, Bissell as well. So Bissell tells Malmgren about other world technologies, basically a division that studies other world technologies. I have made a video on an off world technologies division that I with a lot of research highly suspect was ran by SAIC. So now even more, even more parallels to your research. Interesting. So Bissell tells Malmgren this in 63, I think it was. Yes. And then, yeah, SAIC starts in 69. I haven't had a chance to dig into, you know, any direct connections. It's more just like, it's all at the same time, basically. So SAIC is so weird. And I'm sure you heard about all the stuff with Chris Sharpe in his Liberation Times article in Undersea Retrievals, right? Well, he mentions Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, guess who has plenty of contracts with the Office of Naval Research and the NSW Crane, which is the, which is basically a naval research in electromagnetic and expeditionary weapon lab. And Woods Hole SAIC. So SAIC, Kermit and I talk about this a lot, but they kind of have their hands in every single piece of the pie here. So it just makes so much sense that they would kind of fall into your research. Yeah, right. Okay. God, this is, yeah, I mean, yeah, the more this keeps going, I mean, I think to, you know, going back over, you know, just building the supercut stuff, you know, I'm looking to make a proper documentary on the magenta incident and all that. And so I've been going back over, you know, all of Grush's, I mean, outside of Coltart, you know, he did a podcast with Rebedra Panatti and Guzardi and, you know, and then Panatti to the thing with Strieber talked about it. And it's come up a few other times, but I mean, Grush says right away with Coltart, he's like, yeah, it's received by the OSS back panel via the Vatican. OSS becomes a CIA and he throws it out there. You know, and then when he goes on Rogan, Rogan asked him, you know, about this, you know, he's like, oh, I just wanted to show that this goes further back. And it's international. And I thought that was interesting. And you're like, no, you knew what you were doing. You're making sure that like all of us nerds, like really dig into this stuff, you know, because it's not just some other interesting case or just some crash retrieval. It's like everything about who we are as a country and maybe a world kind of starts there. It starts with the Bush clan getting their hands on this, you know, and again, these people starting the CIA, keeping this stuff secret, running a rough shot all over the world, you know, however many coups, you know, they were a part of, you know, just like ugly stuff that is well known, you know, to anyone who reads history at all, you know, and so you start to see like, oh, yeah, this is all like just one big kind of evil empire, you know, that it's like, it's true. And I love the fact that Grush was able to kind of walk things back a little bit because most people who have just kind of a fleeting interest in the subject think of Roswell as the real start of, you know, possible reverse engineering programs when some people familiar with MJ-12 might think 1941 Cape Jurado is kind of the nexus point, but Grush walking it back further to 1933 Magenta. And who knows, are there possible cases before that as well, such as 1897 of Rora, Texas, or if the claims of Bob Lazar are true, a craft that was found in an archaeological dig and so forth. Yeah, I think I heard really recently that, yeah, Lazar said it came from somewhere in like the Southwest. Oh, did he? I didn't know he gave us. Somebody commented this a few days ago that, yeah, he said something about, yeah, this is really new to me, that I guess, yeah, it was brought in and they think it might have crashed like a thousand years ago or so. Wow, that I've been kept up to date with the kind of, I don't know, yeah. And then the Aurora thing, yeah, I was familiar with, I mean, you know, the airship stuff at that time. And even that's a funny one because it's like the sink crashes into a windmill. Yeah, it's like, it's almost like, like, analogous power in a way, you know, that, that if that was an airship, you know, and it's like, if these things are constantly sort of like pushing us to, you know, advance our science. And then you've got, I mean, I've been reading more lately about radar and death rays, which is like pretty new to me, like radar comes from the search for a death ray, which is basically your first EMP. Interesting. Yeah. So you've got like, Marconi, I'm gonna, maybe I'll do that tonight. Yeah. Marconi, you know, Nobel Prize winner was put in charge of researching your experimenting on the magenta craft by Enrico Fermi of all people who said this whole thing was kind of bullshit. With a famous Fermi paradox that's very lacking. Turns out he said while he was walking with Edward Teller and two other people. So I think he was trying to throw somebody else right at Los Alamos. Yeah, at Los Alamos, I forgot, I forgot about that part. Just learned that recently. But Marconi, you know, he invented radio. And then he was also known for studying electromagnetism in the ionosphere. And I'm really, I don't know if there'd be any way to find out, but I'm really curious if he was testing out his death ray and accidentally brought this craft down. Interesting. And for anybody who doesn't know, Marconi was implicated in the alleged RB33, the internal Italian documents that stated he was kind of the basically in charge of analyzing this craft that crashed in 33. And then in 2024, Panodi came out with more documents vindicating the actual legitimate creation of RB33. So that is, that's pretty interesting. Did you say RB or is it RS? It might be, it's RS. I'm sorry. I was thinking about the RB47 jet while I was talking about that. Because it was a special research. Yes. Okay. Yes. Thank you. And so part seven, this piece was actually taken down. So what, what new, what? Yeah, that just came down a couple of nights ago, because I guess it wasn't UFO-centric enough. What new points kind of, can you talk about that you talked about in this one before we move into eight? I think, where did I end up here? Oh, right. I mean, this was, it's really ended up just being about kind of the crossover between skull and bones. And yeah, there's a, you know, pretty famous story about Prescott Bush was a part of this group that dug up at least what they thought. I don't, I think there were some, it turns out there was some dispute about whether or not it was really him, but, you know, dug up the grave of Geronimo. Interesting. Yeah. Like, like had his skull at their facility, you know, and just some weird black magic stuff there. And so, you know, you kind of start looking at, and then, you know, they start Zapata oil, or, you know, Prescott Bush and Dulles, you know, start Zapata oil in 51 with the help of the CIA, you know, and it turns out it was like a front for the CIA. But even that, it's like, they were sort of like these middle fingers from these white colonizers. It's kind of how I look at it, you know. And so, I think part of what's happening now, even just culturally in general, but let alone this topic and, you know, trying to reveal this true history is like this notion of, like, ugly colonization before we go anywhere else, you know, before we actually go to Mars and beyond, you know what I mean? It's like, we need to do away with a lot of that notion of colonization. And so, I think you start to see, like, that's part of what this whole empire has been from the beginning, you know, just like these white men with power, you know, who's hated more on the planet at the moment, you know. It's like the rich white elite, basically, that have been running things into the ground, you know, and so we get to see kind of where some of that starts, you know, in the modern age at least. And then it's, and then I ended up on Bohemian Grove, and it turns out it's all the same people, you know, it's like all these king makers, basically. And that's kind of the joke, you know, that, like, 36 and still Chill and I talk about, you know, it's just like, oh, yeah, this is what it is. It's just these people wanted to be kings, you know. And Bohemian Grove is similar to Skull and Bones. It's like a secret society that nobody knows what the heck they actually do, besides do weird dances. Yeah. And they, you know, it's worship of an owl and a bunch of other stuff. And we know there's like the Mike Cleland, you know, owl UFO stuff. And, oh, right. And up Solica has talked about that. And so, yeah, I don't know. I haven't read enough into it. I just kind of know some of that cursory stuff. So let's move on to point eight. I heard part eight. I don't know what dang thing about this. It, I hadn't read this. I asked you if it came out and you told me yes. So what can you tell me about this? Because I think it involves a little bit of sort of like the black magic you were talking about with the with Iraq and so forth. Yeah. And maybe, yeah, I mean, without having predetermined any of this and kind of writing it out, you know, as kind of in real time, I guess to go to, you know, to end up at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and whatever they were doing there. And then to close off with like Stargate and the Tomb of Gilgamesh. I mean, that was a thing that kept coming up. You know, everyone's been on the hunt for Colt Hart's UFO too big to move. Right. It's come up a few times that, you know, the U.S. Embassy in Iraq looks like it could be, you know, where this all is. And then I think at some points, you know, a couple of people brought up the fact that the Tomb of Gilgamesh was reported found like barely over a week before we invaded. And there's some other stuff too I found recently within like that timeframe, I forget, but some weird stuff, some business dealings and stuff. And so that's why I was wondering like when specifically JSOC was set up. Oh, interesting. Like all part of this story of JSOC is answering to Cheney. Cheney's the one who was basically running the Bush administration. Just like Bush Senior was running the Reagan administration, you know, the Bush family through the Western Company. Global Defense, which is under dresser industries, is one of the contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Holly Burton famously was the big one. So it's like these guys probably behind 9-11, let it happen. There's a famous, you know, they had a meeting that morning with the Saudis. It's the Carlisle Group in the Saudis. And then 9-11 happens. Didn't Rumsfeld, I think a couple of days before 9-11, talk about like two or three trillion dollars missing at the Pentagon as well? The day before. Okay, day before. Interesting. Yeah, September 10. I just read that again. So you were talking about the Iraqi embassy, I think even before Ross coming out and talking about the massive UFO buried under some sort of construction, there were stories that the Iraqi embassy was built over a UFO, as well as other stories in the kind of somewhat local area of the Middle East. There's some rich Munda stories, like a 1958 crash retrieval occurring in Kabul, Afghanistan and so forth. So there's actually a lot of really rich lore in the Middle East that I don't even think has been begun to be explored until your piece. So yeah, I think part of this, so yeah, I've been kind of hearing that stuff. And then, you know, I haven't read either of the Skinwalker books, but I caught up on an older apocaster a couple of years ago with George Knapp that kind of re-aired with, I think, on UAP studies, you know, this was a couple months ago. But he basically walks through the timeline of, you know, Bigelow and NIDS in the late 90s, early 2000s. And then you've got Bass, which is basically where a lot of, you know, UFO reports and stuff are being sent in the 2000s. And then whatever happens there to, you know, ASAP and then ATIP. And what really stuck out to me was that he said that when Hunt for the Skinwalker came out, you know, that was Knapp and Kelleher, then it got passed around to people at the DIA in the Middle East, like Likatsky. Interesting. And so you're like, oh, okay, Likatsky was working for the DIA in the Middle East in 2007. Maybe the year after we build this embassy and they're looking for stuff, you know, like it would kind of make sense if that was all tied together. And also 2007, I don't know what he was doing, but Kirk Patrick was part of some joint CIA DIA operation. And I know it came out recently. I know Carl Nell was on like the first team that went over there in 2003. And I think Elizondo was also on another like first team that went over there. So I don't know. Yeah. It's just a lot of stuff around this. And then it gets weirder. So scrolling through the article, I see you bring up a picture of the alleged Holloman Air Force base tape, which was actually just talked about by James Fox in his interview with Jesse Michaels. James Fox stated in one of his documentaries, he interviewed a guy that had seen this tape. What is the context here of including this clip or including this image? I don't remember. What did Cameron say? Something about, because it's Cameron who's been tying Cheney into a lot of this stuff. But Carter knew what Cheney knew eventually. Right. I don't remember exactly. Okay. Yeah. You're talking about Grant Cameron and Jimmy Carter. Here we mentioned the story of Carter crying. I still don't know. We still don't know if that's a legitimate story or not. She hand talking about Carter's election. Let's see if possibly under here. Okay. Jimmy Carter. Oh, oh, cool. Okay. Here. Okay. So Grant Cameron commented on this. So apparently this 15 minute film was shown to Jimmy Carter. Grant Cameron states this. Grant Cameron is a fantastic researcher. And this film, without reading this clip just from my head, apparently shows a saucer with three landing gear touching down, a hatch opening up from a smooth surface that doesn't show any sort of view holes, port holes, signs of propulsion, all the classic observables of a craft. A sort of runway comes down. Three beans come out. They look like tall humanoid individuals wearing headgear that a film altars said looked like Egyptian headdresses. And so James Fox talked about this video quite a bit in his recent interview with Jesse Michaels and said he interviewed I can't remember the exact person. Yeah. I'm almost done with that interview. It's really dang good so far. Yeah. That's great. Interesting. So according to Grant Cameron, Carter had seen this footage. And in the footage, I think like the beans basically start interacting with humans, which is pretty darn interesting. It reminds me a lot of 1957. You know astronaut Gordon Cooper, he stated while he was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, he had a survey team film kind of remote parts of the base. And one of his survey teams caught a UAP landing that is same kind of saucer shaped craft, I think 40 feet in diameter. And when his film crew got close, the saucer within 20 yards of the craft it took off and he had seen this film and others had and then apparently it was confiscated. So that sounds very similar. I can't remember the exact date of this. 57. Okay. 57. Yeah. Then the Edwards might have been 54. So these I think were within three years, these two supposed films. Oh, right. Yeah. Because 50. I'm trying to, yeah, put all this together. Because wasn't. Oh, right. Okay. Because this, I think what I read and I mean, I don't, a lot of it wasn't verified, but I think there was talk that what I knew of Kingman, I know you did your video, you know, which I think probably the best one I saw, I mean, it was great too. You know, Kingman, the story that I understand is that there were like eight craft and there were dog fight and one crashes into the side of a cliff and it's totally demolished. One crashes into the ground. A guy's brought out to study it in engineer. And I think there's a dead body, one or two, I forget. That was the Stancil crash. Okay. And then, and then a third one is gifted. And that maybe these were the, like Eisenhower was at all three of the sites or something like that, that it was like the Kingman gifting was at one base, maybe at the Dugway site, which I know Greer's talked about a lot near Kingman. And then another one was Edwards and then there was a third one somewhere else. So that like one of these was the sites where possibly Eisenhower made his agreement and 53 or maybe it was this before, I'm not really sure. Because the Kingman kind of the multiple craft theory came from Harry Drew. And just like you said, over I think a week in March, seven days in March, his documentary, there were three separate crashes, one crash, one forced landing with which Arthur Stancil saw and one kind of gifted craft. Okay. Which is very interesting. And that documentary seven days in March or seven days in May, I can't remember, is almost impossible to track down. I've never heard of it. It's a, Harry Drew packaged it with a like a book, a limited release DVD. So I know a couple of like researchers who have been trying to track down that dang tape, but nobody has found it. It seemed like that 53 to 57 region had a time span had a lot of really interesting contacts because there's the Edwards Air Force Base touchdown, according to Gordon Cooper. There's the, there's the Holloman Air Force Base landing film according to Grant Cameron now that Jimmy Carter saw. And there's the Kingman crash all in the span of four years. Yeah. Right. Well, and that's coming after 52, you know, which was a pretty bonkers year as well. And 53 to start, we saw the Robertson panel as well. And 52 we see UFOs over Washington DC. Right. Right. Yeah. You know, I've, I haven't read all of the the Schellenberger document. You know, I've posted it a couple of times, but every 10 pages, I'm just like, I cannot, like this is crazy. Like, it's, you know, that's the, that's the timeline debrief for Congress, right? I, yeah, it's 177 pages or maybe that's just the first document or something. But yeah, it's just like, Oh, another craft, more dead bodies, whatever, you know, it's just like so routine for these guys, you know, whether you hit the nail on the head, it's exactly 177 pages. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's like every time I started to get through it, it just spun me out so bad. You know, it was like, Oh, this is just completely normal. It became normal, you know, immediately after Roswell, basically, that like they kept finding, you know, these crashes and these dead beings and stuff, and they didn't care. You know, they were like, Oh, okay, just like, box them up, you know, we'll take care of them. Like, have you gotten a chance to read Leonard Stringfield's crash retrievals parts one through seven? I know I haven't read any of his stuff yet. No, I'll, I'll actually send you the PDF of that. That is in is so consequential to my research. And I think you follow the ufology in general, especially talking about crash retrievals and the subject of bodies. It is so fascinating. And Michael Schrat, this was in 2016, I think, was able to access the archives of Leonard Stringfield, who is now deceased in Cincinnati, and made a whole nother series of kind of crash retrieval cases that Leonard never published, including including discussion of the Edwards film as well. So there's a quite a tangible research line for the supposed films of craft touching down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually, I got to hang out with Michael Schrat last Sunday. Oh, did you? Oh, yeah, yeah, you told me. So I joined the Hollywood Disclosure Alliance early August to try and reach out to producers, you know, for documentary stuff. And so even that was like, Oh, I'm like emailing with Steve Bassett and, you know, Dan Harari. And, and then they had an event last Sunday, and it was Thomas Jane, Ron James from Mufon, and then Michael Schrat. And then we went to a dinner afterwards and the location kept getting moved, just some weird confusion, I guess. So it came down to like, eight of us or something. And I'm at this dinner table with like, Michael Schrat to my left, Steve Bassett to my right, you know, Dan Harari right in front of me. And I'm just like, Oh, okay, I guess this is my world now, you know. Now, did you get to talk with Schrat extensively about crash retrievals? Because he's just so well versed on on that subject. What'd you guys get to talk about? Yeah, I got to film in on magenta, because he didn't know any of the stuff yet. Right. He called me the next day, we talked for like 20, 30 minutes about it. And then he, we were, he wanted to meet up today, but I was like, Well, I'm doing this thing. And so we take president over Schrat, I'm honored, man. That's like an hour from me, it's fine. Yeah, he's pretty close. I know he's been looking for with his incredible drawings of craft and sightings used like by almost every researcher. He's been trying to find a more concrete description of the magenta craft to be able to draw because I think so the only real description we have is from Grush, like a lenticular shape. Yeah, right, right. Two saucers pressed against each other. That's slightly damaged, but whole integrity intact. Right, right. I mean, that's kind of what I walked in through and I was showing him, I don't know if he'd seen the Daily Mail article on, on that, it's the only big one that I've seen, but yeah, I was just showing him, I'm like, I don't know, this is all I've seen. And so, you know, I know that and whatever Grush said, you know, and so that's what he was trying to, you know, get down to is just like, what are the exact dimensions? How exactly, you know, did it crash? I'm like, I don't know, I'll send you some stuff. Still have all the way dating back to the magenta case, have you been able to kind of tie in any of the mega defense conglomerates like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Boeing, Northrop Grumman into, into your work as well alongside the EG and G Carlisle SAIC and some of the oil conglomerates? No, I mean, that stuff has been even, yeah, too confusing for me just to understand like the parallels, you know, between the defense contractors. I mean, I know, you know, Lockheed works directly with the Air Force. I just, I don't really understand like this, where the CIA, basically, I don't know where the CIA and the Air Force split, because it seems like that's part of this story. Yeah, it seems like, yeah, especially where's the difference, because there's a lot of joint teams in JSOC that can operate under CIA's directive or any sort of directive. And the Air Force has quite a few teams, 24th STS, the old classic blue berets and so forth. The Air Force is very interesting, but so is the, also the naval involvement as well as outlined by Chris Sharp. Yeah, right. In his recent article, I think he, after his third edit, because I think there was some trouble with Dean, Dean Johnson. Yeah, but I try to extend an apology to him because I had talked about the original edit that Sunday before any of that drama came out. So I felt bad if I had implicated him in anything bad like the threats he said. Yeah, I'm confused though. I wasn't paying enough attention. What happened with all that? So September 20th is when the article is released. September 22nd, I did a live and I remember I had read the article when it first the second it came out. And I was gobsmacked to see mention of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office of CIA, Office of Science and Technology, NRO, NGA, Lockheed Martin, and Woodsville Ocean ographic Institute. And come the 22nd, that had been edited out. So thankful to the Wayback Machine, I was able to talk about the original version of that article. And then that week on Twitter, Dean, Dean Johnson, I guess, called Chris Sharp out or something. And Chris Sharp stated that he had received threats due to the original article. So he re-edited everything out there and basically expanded on the fact or not fact, but the allegations that Woods Hole, in accordance to kind of NRO, the underwater reconnaissance office, will retrieve craft due to their very unique submersibles and then pass them on to the Office of Naval Research for testing alongside defense contractors. Yeah, okay. Just another thing. Yeah, because I feel like for so long, the Navy's been overlooked in terms of but going back to the nexus of like Air Force Regulation 200-2 and JANAP-146C in which the USAF kind of restricted UFO reporting methods and like incurred a $10,000 fine if commercial pilots reported UFOs, the Navy did the same thing with OPMAV 3820. So the Navy was right there with the Air Force back in the heyday of kind of restricting UFO reporting. Gotcha. Okay. This is so bonkers. And then of course, there's corporations that tie into every single piece of this, whether that's the Lockheed-Norton, SAIC, EG&amp;G. Right, right. And I think, I mean, that's the way we've all are in our little chat. Yeah, kind of been joking about it too, is just like, well, it makes sense. I mean, all of this makes sense now. I think half jokingly to sort of talk about a lot of this is being almost biblical in a general sense. There are these revelations coming out and there's so much at play all at the same time. You know what I mean? It's like we've got the craziest political upheaval we've ever had. We've got climate crisis. We just watched the crazy flooding yesterday on the East Coast. Just so much income inequality and disparity and all these things and all these reckonings happening on a cultural level and socioeconomic level while all of this stuff is happening as well. And it's almost like, yeah, the whole, it's like this entire system has been built up. And this is like when it all kind of comes down. This is the house of cards, basically. And so even to talk strictly about all the different contractors, it's like this whole thing is so unwieldy. And like the way Dana Solika talked about the Fight Club, it's like that thing's making more sense now. Just all these people have it. Yeah, the picture of corporations involved in contractors as well as USG specific three-letter agencies and USG military branches that are involved is starting to become a bit clear. And it's been very fascinating to follow these revelations and see how a JSOC, OGA, ONR, NRO, NRO, NGA and so forth has implicated. It's so interesting. I wonder if the magenta craft, if it where it's being housed now, if there's still sort of efforts being done on it or it's just kind of catalogued away and like an Indiana Jones relic warehouse. Yeah, I mean, what was Birchhead's joke? Like every time you name them, the whole truck shows up. It takes stuff away. Yeah, yeah. I mean, my best guess is that initially, it might have been taken to Oak Ridge, you know, because, you know, Vannevar Bush gets the memo from, I think from FDR, from Marshall. I forget. There's some of the three of them are talking, basically, you know, so he gets to setting up Oak Ridge, you know, and this is also following the Cape Girardeau incident. So, you know, if they had everything, at that time at least, you know, had everything in one place because there was no Edwards Air Force base or anything, who knows now or any of this stuff is, you know. And I found it interesting in later cases, especially in the 60s and the 70s, how often mention is made of kind of rotating warehouses of where craft are stored. One perfect example is Kecksburg that is supposedly taken to Lockburn Air Force Base in Ohio first and then shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. There's also the testimony of an anonymous witness RB in Stringfield's files that talked about guarding a craft about three hours outside of a base in South Carolina and that every two weeks, three weeks, it would be rotated through. Oh, really? And also, in a project I'm covering now, there's stories of reverse engineering testing team that's rotated through every six months for program security. So, possibly not only are materials transferred around and shipped around, but personnel are too. But is that kind of an old method or is that still ongoing? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know about sight of things at all. I haven't heard any of that stuff. But it's just, what do you have next for your research? Where do you plan on going next? I don't know. I have to like, yeah, I have to figure out personal stuff. I fit so down this rabbit hole. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I've been looking into like the death ray stuff, which is really interesting. And, you know, Marconi playing around with that stuff and Tesla playing around with that stuff. And, you know, John Trump, you know, Donald Trump's uncle, who is basically given all of Tesla's files after he dies. And at the same time, he was in like the x-ray business. And then I think when it was announced we were going to World War II, he got into radar. And so it's funny that he's the one who's given Tesla's documents, you know, Tesla was also like, if radar came from the death ray, and that's what John Trump specifically was also working on, was radar stuff. But, you know, even the way like, if you watch like Simon Hollis, you know, that's kind of where I sort of started locking onto that, you know, that like we understood more about radar early on than we let anybody know that it was all derived from an F-ray. And it basically was like an EMP early on. So, and then it makes sense that it's, you know, partly responsible for a lot of these crashes early on as well, you know. Yeah, there's early stories, especially with Roswell, that's some sort of radar interference, kind of a mess with a craft's inner circuitry or however the craft are powered. That's an awesome rabbit hole. Oh, yeah, that's fun. Yeah. I mean, I was watching the, I don't know if you saw the Falcon crew guys who got the part of the arts parts a couple months ago, and we're testing it. Oh, they've done material, they've been doing material analysis. A little bit, yeah, and they were super public right away, you know, they were live streaming at all. But, yeah, they got a little bit of it anonymously, and, or by a source who wanted to stay anonymous. And, yeah, I just happened to catch it that day, and they were looking at it, and it matches up with so much other stuff that a lot of us have heard about, like the terrorist waveguide stuff, and how it basically acts as a superconductor, and, and it looks, it would make sense, you know, if it's like 3D printed material, and there's like a lattice honeycomb structure inside of it. So it makes sense if like the power gets transferred up, it's like this really, like beautiful way, basically, that, you know, the whole thing gets powered. And, yeah, it's pretty wild. I mean, I had, I had a sighting once that kind of lines up with some of that stuff. Oh, would you see? I've had a few, but this was the closest one, this was back in January, not far from my house. Yeah, I saw two, I'm assuming it was two, they were in the clouds, and so I didn't see any like structure, but I basically just saw the underside of like the, I'm guessing, like electromagnetic waves that were powering these things, you know, and one was like this beautiful amber, and one was this beautiful violet, and they were really close together, moving really slow, like, wow, do they have any like change in direction? Could you see kind of a shape of a craft? I mean, they were saucer shaped, but I didn't see any like hard craft surfaces or anything. They were like, yeah, just inside the clouds, and I was like coming in from hanging out in my backyard and looked up, and right there, things moved really slow, and I kind of waved and said hi, and they took off into the clouds real slow, and I was like, okay. Interesting, now you said you could see kind of like an electromagnetic discharge, what you, you could see kind of a visible wave pattern? Yeah, there's a, I can't mean to find these and save them, there's two images I've seen, one is of a, one went around a month or two ago, it's like a coin, I forget from where, but one side is like of a craft, and then the other side is like a straight up reptilian, like smiling or something, and there's another image from, like this famous historical image from Italy, from Rome or something, that's very similar to where the craft, it's like these grooves on the bottom, and so it kind of like, if you can imagine, like let's say, eight or ten grooves on the bottom, and it's kind of like each one had its own like energy field. Interesting. So all I could see was the energy basically. Kind of like of a saucer shape? Yeah, yeah, it was, yeah it was beautiful, yeah, it was wild. That sounds fascinating. And it was, I mean, yeah, and it was, I was having like a particularly bad night too, so it was kind of funny when you talk about the psychic connection, whatever all of that means, you know, it was kind of like, yeah, I was having a rough one, and it just, it was like, came out from under my carport, and it looked up, and they were just right there. Wow. Okay, thanks. That is incredible. And I went back in and kept playing video games, yeah. Whatever, geez. Voler, I'll let you, I'll let you go now. I got a 20 minutes until a hard stop, and I usually do a tiny bit of a Q&amp;A right before, but real fast, where can you run through part eight real quick? Yes, please, yes. Okay, so apparently the story of a Stargate was going around in the 1920s in Iraq, and a lot of the world's rich and elite were kind of obsessed with it. Apparently, some of this isn't in there, apparently who Saddam Hussein found it in like the late 80s. And so when we went to war in 90, that's a big part of what they were looking for, Bush and Cheney. And I guess Cheney was like obsessed with the idea of a Stargate, you know, and this like ultimate power and time and space and all this weird stuff. Some people have reached out to me to say that like when we invaded in 2003, that was specifically, they were looking for that. And I think that's what they found, purportedly, what they found in this tomb of Gilgamesh is this Stargate. And there was a story too of, I think Russian officers in like 91 saw the US shoot down a UFO in Iraq. Interesting. Yeah, so basically, yeah, it looks like that's possible. Stargate, UFO, whatever. I mean, there's this J-Rod story in the Stargate and all of that. So, yeah. In part nine, we might see a further investigation into the Stargate because I find that absolutely fascinating. I have a very amateur level of knowledge here. So, it's just keeps getting crazier. So, we got part nine to look forward to and the documentary you're starting to work on for Magenta. That's new documentary. Yeah, definitely some stuff about the death ray x-ray or death ray radar stuff. I don't know. I haven't really thought it out too much. So, where, so Reddit and Medium under voller records, where else could we find you? I started it about a year ago, losing my mind after Grush. And then my Reddit posts were getting too long. Oh, wait, I think I lost, yeah. Where'd you go? Oh, sorry. What was I looking for? Oh, my Medium is Escape Velocity. Escape Velocity. Okay, I have that in your Reddit posts in the video description. Okay, awesome. Cool. I know that we kind of glossed over some of the details, but I highly recommend reading every single part one through eight and clicking through the links because in every single piece you've made, you have linked a tremendous amount of third party research and other avenues to go down. And that is my favorite thing about this research that nothing is just a you saying, okay, here's an executive summary. It's the entire body of research with clickable links. And people still complain. So whatever. I mean, I don't care anymore. You can never have 100. It's too many links. Hey, man, you know how many times I get people calling me out of my videos for not pronouncing words, right? There will always be some level of dissatisfaction. As long as you're putting together a cohesive thesis with supporting links and an argument, I think you're doing a fantastic job. And these eight pieces I have learned so much from. I think they're amazing. Cool. Yeah, lost my mind. Trying to get it back now. All right, Voler, well, I will catch up with you privately, my man. And thank you so much for coming on the show. Once I wrap this up at here, six PM my time, I'll shoot you a text and we'll talk a little bit more. Thank you so much, brother. I appreciate it. All right. Bye, brother. Yeah. Okay, guys, we're going to do 15 minutes of Q&amp;A while I get Voler signed off here. Everybody, please thank Voler for coming on the show. He's done a tremendous eight parts. It's incredibly difficult to try and talk about all eight parts he's done because this is like a massive body of research. So check out all eight parts. We're going to do 15 minutes until I got to get off of Q&amp;A. Because you know, I love to do that at the end. If you guys will give me one second, I'm just going to run to the restroom, put some questions up and I will get to them in like two seconds. All right, give me less than a minute. I'll be right back. You know, okay, guys, I am back. So let's let's start going through some questions. One of my boys texted me said there was a little bit of quarrel going on in the chat. So if somebody wants to enlighten me as to what was going on, let me know. Also, I just find the connection of the entire Bush family to the legacy programs fascinating. I think this is an avenue that should continue to be explored and I cannot wait. So I did miss a couple super chats, too close, two cents, fat rodents, Ort Wiener. Thank you guys so much for donating. I so appreciated it. I didn't get a chance to look at the chat during the conversation with Volare Records, but I appreciate him coming on the show so very much. I think those eight pieces are fantastic. And I hope he makes a documentary on Magenta. Let's start with Big Dog. Yeah, the Bush research is fantastic all the way from the Magenta crash to OSS to big oil companies and so forth. So we'll start going through these. Zach, what's up, brother? Where do you draw your line? Is open landing and contact in a military base too much fixed point out? It's like the same time and location as Sakura. I'm not sure, especially in terms of the Holloman and Edwards Air Force Base landing. It seems like a almost one off occurrence as far as we know of Fox, not Fitz. Okay, okay, I see. Fox points out it's like the same time and location as Sakura. I still find it strange, especially the Holloman Air Force Base landing is almost an isolated incident in which beans outright present themselves. However, there is one more story of that I'm going to cover up in my next video at an Air Force Base of some beans who almost willingly walk out of their craft and give it up. It's a story in one of Leonard Stringfield's crash retrievals. It's very interesting, so I can't wait to cover that. So let's see. Okay, you guys must be chatting about some in here. Let me know what you guys have been talking about. Have I watched the X Files mythology episode? Highly recommend no, but I've wanted to get into X Files, especially a couple cool people in my discord have been talking about X Files and one of the creators I think Frost and how X Files may have had a little bit of interesting inside tidbits in terms of this, in terms of their research. So what's your opinion on Daniel Salter and the Accio? I do not know what the Accio is. So if ACIO, I don't know if it's an acronym, so please fill me in so I can do some research. Have you had a chance to look at Larry Reed from Lockheed? You should try and get an interview with him. No, I have not. I still want to get, I'm still trying to get in, not contact, but a little more information on Dr. Jim Ryder as well. But Larry Reed is up there. Did I accidentally say cover up? I don't know. Did I? I don't think I did. I need to fix the spectacles. If I said cover up, let me know how I said it. The Iraq Gilgameshian Bible and buried UAP rabbit hole, it's wild. I need to read the whole part eight because the tomb of Gilgameshian Iraq and the possible embassy being built in that region because of some sort of UAP technology or tech as well as Dick Cheney is really interesting. I'm such a novice here. That's why I was so excited when Voler texted me today and said that he had this part eight out on Stargate. It's wonderful. Mentioned of X-Files and Twin Peaks, I think the same Frost, the showwriter worked on both. Let's see. Let's see. Everybody's loving Stargate is... Okay, let's see. Sounds like you and Voler need to get together with some of the connections you both talked about. I'm going to make him a chart of his names and dates and overlaps. You made him something. I'd love to see that. That's awesome. I would love to work with Voler, Kermit, Senior Trader, 3942, a lot of guys on a joint project because there are some amazing researchers out there that the bulk majority of their work has been put out on Reddit. If I can help it, I'll use the platform to let some of them come on and talk about their research like Voler. I think it's fantastic. Fringe is better than X-Files. I've never seen Fringe, so maybe I will have to watch that. Let's keep going through. Leave the Bill Herman abduction. Maybe some new interesting abduction stuff coming up soon, guys. I've heard Stargate is a very good show, the original. I recently made an executive decision. I was between that and Battlestar Galactica, the early 2000s show. I decided to go with Battlestar, so maybe I'll do Stargate next. The first season of X-Files was based on RealPerson's FBI case, John Sousa. That sounds somewhat familiar, but my recollection is failing me, so I need to do some extra research there. Okay. I would love to team up with Jesse Michaels and Danny Jones. We'll see about Jesse. We never got to get together when he was here in Colorado. Just got to be a little bit too big, but he and I chat often, so there should be some more time soon coming up that we can link up. Sorry. Cheney must have met with analysts at CIA's WinPack many times leading up to the invasion of Iraq, probably. Yeah, absolutely. I still find it so interesting that, according to Voller's research, Cheney might have had a vested interest in some exotic technologies that Iraq. Okay, let's see. After reading through Voller's posts and watching your vids, is there any area you recommend someone to look into, something that is often overlooked? Patterns with bodies associated with crash retrievals. I think a lot of the time with crash retrievals, I talk about this a lot, people are afraid to go into the territory of bodies because it's so contentious, and a lot of people look at it with such ridicule, but bodies are one of the most fascinating and unexplored aspects of retrieval operations. Santiago, have I ever played Halo? Dude, is that even a question? Halo reaches my ultimate gaming experience I've ever had. I know Halo 3 is probably considered the greatest Halo game, but I will continue to preach that Halo reach was the pinnacle of gaming. I loved that game. Okay, so the ACIO Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization. No, I need to look into that more. Is the Looking Glass located at S4? Yes, Mr. Mozilla. According to Dan Burish and a couple other alleged sources, Project Looking Glass is located at area S4. According to the design specs by Dan Burish, S4 has five levels, with the lowest level housing J-Rod level, the level above being like a crew quarter for testing the level above housing Project Looking Glass. Still, I get asked this all the time when I look into Dan Burish. Probably at some point, but I got a lot of other stuff first. The Looking Glass is pretty interesting, and there is a whole PDF. It's like a book. It's called Project Aquarius that focuses on Dan Burish's claims in Looking Glass. I highly recommend looking at that. I'll post a link to it in the Discord. I do remember Reach. Reach is fantastic. The final mission, Survive, is that can bring a tear to any man's eyes. Did you know the CIA trains psychic spies to build mental protective barriers around CIA facilities to prevent remote viewers from spying? Yes, I did. I've heard about that. I don't know specific instances, specifics, or specific individuals, but I have heard of that. The CIA and private companies research into psionics and psychic powers remote viewing is something that fascinates me greatly. Could reported classified alien religious documents be declared constitutional violation of freedom to practice religion by the Supreme Court forcing disclosure? That is assuming that classified alien religious documents exist, which I think that is alleged by Bob Lazar and the Reddit biologist. I think the two people who have commented on that, if such documents exist, I think that would bring a lot of really interesting questions on theology. Can you please never say scintillating again? I'm sorry, I just did. But I'll try to. The word scintillating is great. So something or someone says, I wouldn't say remote viewing is real. I remain unconvinced. Okay, so you're talking about remote viewing. Yeah, I would also like to see demonstrations of remote viewing. Very interested in it. Have I come across a lab laboratory in Italy in my research? I have never, but that might be something I'll pull over to a voler to look into in conjunction with the magenta case. Scintillating. Okay, guys, at this point, you know that there are many words that I pronounce absolutely horribly in the videos I go through and try to make sure I pronounce everything correctly, but I will miss stuff. I just can't speak too well. That being said, the new video should be here tomorrow or Tuesday. I'm thinking Tuesday to put some extra time into it. I really think you guys are going to enjoy this video. It is another primary investigation with a ton of research put into it. The video I would liken it most to is the Off-World Technologies Division. There are some pretty surprising research avenues here, so keep an eye out for that. I'm not going to spoil the name or the subject of it. After that, we have another really cool crash retrieval. Fire away the questions, guys. We've got a couple more minutes. If anybody's got any more questions, maybe I'll give another hint to the next video. I guess I kind of disclosed something. It involves mention of various Air Force bases such as Nellis. That's going to be a cool one. I appreciate that, Hayden Pierce, even if I'm mispronouncing stuff. This one involves the possibility of reverse engineering in various Air Force bases, most notably Nellis. There was a reason that I talked about the U2 with Nellis and testing there at Area 51. Area 51 is just northwest of Nellis at the Nevada Test and Training Range. I think in the comments, some of you guys are talking about not trusting Elizondo. What have been some of the arguments for and against Elizondo in the chat? If you guys are talking about Elizondo, I'd like to see some of these. A little bit of discourse in the chat. You guys, let me know what's going on. I appreciate that, big dog. There's so many topics in this space that aren't covered necessarily to a wide extent. As we see with Volor Records, research that even analyzing just a small case or an individual in their connection to UAP requires a tremendous amount of research and diving into. You haven't checked the Scott Castle USO story. Guy says he has footage somewhere of a USO. I'd be very interested to see that. I'd like to put some more time into USO research, especially with the implication of Woods Hole, Neuro, O&amp;R, and so forth. If there's any USO videos, I would like to see those. The only USO related video I've seen was a Reddit post of just some anomalous lights under some water. This photo occurred at night. I'm sure you guys know what I'm talking about and have seen that. Guy says he has footage somewhere, a tail has as old as time. With many cases, there will be alleged footage. That's why stuff like Holloman and the Edwards Air Force Base is a bit frustrating because even though somebody like Gordon Cooper and accomplished Mercury astronaut will say that footage exists, there's still no way to get our hands on such footage. Throughout Crash Retrieval's Parts 1-7 from Leonard Stringfield, there is also much discussion of a supposed alien autopsy as well, some sort of lost footage. I think there was a NASA astronaut recently who mentioned seeing some sort of NHI video as well. Were you talking about the story where a guy from the retrieval team asked a bunch of languages but the beans are just catatonic and walk right off the craft? Can I get the Stringfield PDF too? Yes, I will post that. No, those are two different things. The bunch of languages is the infographics whistleblower who talks about the head doctor who is fluent in Russian, English, Chinese, and other languages. He references some cases where the beans found are almost children that can be led by pointing. This is a small story. It's a small excerpt in Leonard Stringfield. I think it's Part 9 of Crash Retrieval's Part 6. Sorry, there's a bunch of parts in it. I only make mention of this because it is of important contextual relevance to my case. I will tell you exactly where it is, Zach. Are you in the discord? I'll post it there. Could there be a connection between UFO and the gremlins at the RAF? The RAF Royal Air Force claims would cause trouble for them. Quite possibly. I'm not too familiar with the claims of RAF and the gremlins. That might be something I have to look into a little bit. Space Geek says, thank you for all your hard work. You have the most well-researched videos. I truly believe once the YouTube algorithm finds you, you'll have millions of subs very soon. Thank you, ma'am. That'd be cool. I don't even know how to deal with 10,000 subs, let alone a million. Boy, that would be a dream. I'm going to post the Discord link one more time, guys, because Zach wants to hop in. Hop in the Discord if you want to chat about UAP during the day, talk about anything. There's some really sharp researchers in there, too. Really sharp guys. Zach just posted, Anthony, good show. Interesting links about EGNG, Carlisle, and various players. Thank you. I very much appreciate that. You have a story of Eric Tabor, especially with EGNG. Area 51 is really interesting, especially how it ties into the donation craft theory. That patch, there was a lot of controversy around that, because I think Eric Tabor didn't think much about it initially, so he tried to pawn it off on eBay. That's why there was a bit of steam when Ross Colthart posted the patch initially in his presentation, and then it images surfaced of it up on eBay. That got a little hairy at one point, but that's a great story. Of course, Eric Tabor is a second, if not a third-hand whistleblower, but still him talking to Arrow is still of consequence, and I still find that extremely interesting and worth paying attention to. You're talking about Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl talking about Gremlins. No, that's interesting, but as a child, I loved Roald Dahl's work, especially the BIG. I'd like to check that out. Okay, what are you guys? We'll answer a handful more, guys, and then we shall sign off, so I can also post some of those documents and so forth in the Discord. If there's anything I forget to post, please just let me know. My mind's going a couple miles or miles a minute when we talk, so there's some stuff I might forget, but I know I need to post for you, Zach, that specific excerpt of Crash Retrieval's Part 1 through 7. I'll just post the full thing, and I'd love to talk a little bit about Michael Schratz diving into Leonard Stringfield's work, so that's another one I'd like to look into. Guys, if there are no more questions, okay, okay, upcoming vids you are working on, any tees? Yes, I just did tease the new video that should come out Monday or Tuesday. I will say one word, or I guess two words, and that is reverse engineering, and I guess another couple of words, I will say Air Force Base, and this video has been a blast to work on just as much as the Off-World Technologies Division. That's the sort of video I would like in it, too. Big dog, thank you so much. Thank you. I really appreciate the support, as always, man. And if you guys are arguing about Elizondo, Yuri Geller, how did he get brought up, and other people do, I'd love to see it in the Discord or bring up the arguments. I'd love to see what you guys are talking about, but with that, my friends, we shall sign off for the day, and I really appreciate everybody joining. Thank you so much. The video should be out Monday or Tuesday, and we will have a next stream on Sunday and possibly a couple other things coming out in between then. But thank you all so much for joining, and I will catch everybody on the next show.</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/t85t8QpTsD4/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>ATIP</li> <li>Accio</li> <li>Alan Dolis</li> <li>Alan Dolos</li> <li>Alan Dulles</li> <li>Alex Jones</li> <li>Angleton</li> <li>Anthony</li> <li>Arrow</li> <li>Aurora</li> <li>Avril Hairyman</li> <li>Avril Harriman</li> <li>Bass</li> <li>Battlestar Galactica</li> <li>Bigelow</li> <li>Bilderberg</li> <li>Bill Donovan</li> <li>Bill Herman</li> <li>Birchhead</li> <li>Bissell</li> <li>Bob Echler</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Bohemian Grove</li> <li>Brad</li> <li>Brad Sorensen</li> <li>Brad Sorenson</li> <li>Britt</li> <li>Brown</li> <li>Bush</li> <li>C.

We'll see. Hello, everybody. We are live. If you guys can hear, please just post in the comments that you're hearing us and we can get started. So I need to see, usually there, now the live counter's up. So there we go. Now it'll start populating. There's definitely more than, okay, zero people in. We've got 13 people here. What is up, guys? Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Somebody let us know. And then I need to hop on Twitter and say, and put the live link as well. So let's just see while this kind of sorts itself out. Sweet. They can hear us. I'd put it on my Twitter as well, but I have like two followers. Okay. Okay. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. So guys, let me post a tweet real fast, but I'll do another introduction as more people start filtering in. But this is Kermit. He is the researcher you guys know who helped me out with the SAIC. Hey, it's C. Britton. Yeah. He helped tremendously with SAIC, looking at contracts, working that case with me. So let me just get a tweet out real fast. Kermit, if you just want to introduce yourself while I'm doing this, please feel free. Hey, y'all. I'm Kermit. How's it going? I've been posting about UFO stuff under the Reddit name frog and badger. My kind of angle with this is kind of the legal financial framework, you know, specifically, you know, we heard today, I mean, yesterday from the representatives about how they're interested in how taxpayer funds are being spent on these programs. And that's kind of my, it's kind of my area of expertise and my intellectual curiosity, so to speak. So been very, very blessed to be able to work with Gerb the past couple of months on a bunch of different projects. He came to me over the summer is like, Hey, I want to put out this, this documentary on a company that you've been actually doing a lot of research on. And we did a really good collaboration for that. I'm actually very happy with how it turned out. And yeah, just been just digging through financial filings and trying to making, trying to make sense of this legacy program, you know, so the truth is out there. All right. All right. I'm almost done. Live. Sorry, guys. I'm just posting this on Twitter. Might as well just show everyone in the chat here. Gerb and I were able to visit the National Air and Space Museum and I was able to pick up a reproduction vehicle. If you want to call it that B2 stealth bomber. So for any right there, you know, for anybody that doesn't know there are classic stories of the B2 bomber utilizing, utilizing electrogravity technology for an internal mass reduction of up to 89% and then electrogravity technology to kind of obfuscate both exhaust signatures and radar cross section. So I'm posting this guys and then we shall get started right away. Let's do it. Okay. So we'll start just looking. What we'll do guys is we'll kind of talk about our time in DC. We're both in here right now at Capitol Hill. So I'd like to talk a little bit about DC and the hearings as well as we were able to attend the UAP disclosure fund meeting last night. So we got a lot to talk about. We'll talk about immaculate constellation and everything and then we'll kind of go through questions and so forth. So C's is asking right now, who is that guy? C's will say it again. He just introduced himself, but this is Kermit. He's the excellent researcher who helps me out with the SAIC research. His, his, the link to his Reddit will be in the description page. He's made some awesome posts on kind of analyzing the legacy program framework within SEC securities frameworks and stuff. And if you want to tell a little bit about that, I'm a little bit about that post. I'm sure people would love to hear that. Yeah, for sure. My, my most recent posts that I published, I want to say a month and a half ago, I kind of looked at kind of all the laws in the books around like national security programs and then not disclosing those operations on like a private company's financial statements. So going back like almost a hundred years back to the SEC act of 1934, which kind of historical context that was written into law because of the Great Depression and trying to reform the banking system, but included within the SEC act of 1934 was a specific exemption that allowed for the president and the heads of his executive agencies to waive reporting requirements for any company that was involved with classified activities under an executive order. So basically from that, and then throughout kind of the chronology over decades, we kind of see a strengthening of those laws and those regulations that allow for companies like Lockheed Martin, SAIC, you know, other defense primes to basically, you know, do this classified work and not be as transparent or use a little bit more discretion with how they report those operations in their financial statements. And that's such interesting work. I mean, I know of some other individuals who are trying to kind of attack legacy program for more of a financial framework. And this is something that I personally don't see enough in the industry and kind of UAP researchers. So I think that's really interesting, you know, carrying on the legacy of Katharine Austin Fitz, the black budget of the United States and so forth. I just, I just need to make sure we're caught up. I'm right now I'm worried about the this Wi-Fi here in the hotel. So I'm just checking up that our dang stream is live guys. I'm sorry. We're at the holiday in Capitol Hill and okay, we are perfect. It doesn't have the best Wi-Fi. Okay. So already I'm like in Kermit, dude. Kermit's the dog. We've been having so much fun. So, you know, we'll talk a little bit about the hearings. We both got in on Tuesday night. I was fortunate enough to get a media pass for the hearings. So that was awesome. Yeah. If you guys see some of the photos of, I think, who is it, Brett Higgins? Yeah. I mean, the profile picture of the video from, I think Higgins, I'm kind of right there on the side. It was really cool because, you know, right in front of the witnesses was Amar from the S Theory and some other photographers snapping away. You know, inside the room, we'll talk about that. We'll talk about the lines and so forth. This, we talked to many, many, many of the big dogs. Oh, you know, we did. We did. Oh yeah. Yes. And we'll also talk about the event horizon interview as well because something or someone I'm quite close to Ross, the producer of event horizon and then John Michael Godier. So I've been able to talk to them a ton. T.W. This is a friend of mine. There's no Peter here. This is Kermit, but thanks, Steve. Yeah. So doors for the house building, they opened at 7, 7 a.m. Actually earlier than that, there were people standing in line at like midnight, night before. I think one of them was Robert Salas, but I think some people like Matt from the Good Trouble show have been getting heat from Green Street because they actually paid professional waiters to wait in line. So I had a, because I had the media pass, you know, I was afforded a little extra time. I was going to go in right away, but I had some issues just sleep and do the excitement. So I had to wait maybe an hour or two before you. So he showed up at actual 7 a.m. So what was it like first doors, doors open and waiting to get in? Yeah. I mean, strolling, strolling down Capitol Ave to go to the Rayburn office building. I've never attended. I've never been inside like the Capitol building or any of that stuff. I've never attended hearings before. So this is like a new experience for me. And I showed up like in kind of the line for the UFO hearing at like about seven that morning. And at that point, like the line was very, very deep. And I will say there were a lot of people in that line at that point that I was like, Oh my God, like that's, that's Matt for that's Lester. Like, Oh my God. It was a verifiable like who's who have, you know, UFO world and got to take a lot of people's hands, got to meet a bunch of really cool people. Unfortunately, I was in kind of the point or the part of the line that ended up not making it into the main room. I was like 10 people off from getting into that main area. But thankfully the staffers were able to take kind of the rest of us, put us up an overflow and watch that live upstairs. So I mean, not great, but you know, it is one of the picture of the overflow TV. Yeah, for sure. I felt terrible about these guys because, you know, I'll just say, yeah, show it. And then I'll make a quick comment because, you know, I got a lot to say from an almost exact opposite point of view. I mean, it seemed like going in like it seemed like the hearing room is going to be a bit bigger than the one last year. And it was the same hearing room guy. It was the exact same hearing room. Oh, was the exact? Yes. Yes. But there. So there was there were like, I think five rows of seats. Yeah. So this is, I don't know if you guys can see this. If you hold it closer, it should auto adjust. Oh, no. Yes. There we go. That's the TV. That was the screen that I was watching from everybody. Yeah. Front row seat kind of, which is cool. Let's get the camera to auto adjust. Oh, that adjusted poorly. There we go. Okay. It's starting to work. I won't, I won't show my phone. I won't show any other pictures. We're still washed out with light, but that's all right. So kind of from from my POV, I got to go in at a hearing started at 1130. I got to go in at 11 through the media entrance. Some other people who got to do that were Jesse Amar from Yes Theory, Chris from Area 52. He recently put out the, the Project Gravitar interview. And I got to talk to him. I never met him. He's awesome. I really liked speaking to him. Chris was great. You know, Jesse was rocking around and kind of his more laxed where I think it's so funny because only Jesse could get away with that. In line, you know, most people have their suits on. They're looking quite dapper. They're ready to go. And then there is, there's some people out there with like alien headbands on. There was, there was a lot of different fits on, man. There's, there were a bunch of different people. I mean, talk about, talk about a like very, it's just like, like all walks of life. You know what I mean? So then that was really cool to see too. All walks of life unifying. But the only person that could really pull it off, I'd say was, was Jesse. The only person who looked like normal in a sense with a kind of strange bloving on was Jesse. But yeah, some of the people that were pretty early in line were like Robert Salas. I think Chris Bledsoe was there. But as far as people meeting, waiting in line, waiting in line met a ton of people. There were actually a couple of people who recognized my name, which was really cool. There are a few people like that. It was awesome. It was great to talk to some people. So many people showed out. But you know, before getting in, talk to Jesse, Area 52, James Fox, a bunch. James Fox actually posted a video, kind of walking through the hall. And I think I walked right in front of him and I just looked like an idiot in that Lester Nair as well from the UAP Caucus. He's a friend of ours. He actually was one of the people who helped us get into the UAPDF. And that was really great. But so getting into the actual witness room, we got to get in 30 minutes early. And from there, some of the RSVP, some of the reserved seats got to pour in. And this took up about three or two and a half of the five rows. And of these people were people you'd expect, you know, Leslie Kane, we'll talk a little bit more about her later, because I actually got to talk to her for quite a while at the UAPDF. Jeremy Corbell, I have some good insights as to the drama there. Who else? James Fox, Jesse, Chris, Ryan Graves. A ton of people started pouring in and the witnesses even early. So before the hearing even started, I got to chat a little bit with Jeremy and so forth. I actually had a kind of a funny experience with him. I introduced myself to Jeremy. I said, you know, hello, my name is I gave him my first name. And he's like, where have I seen you before? And I said, maybe on YouTube under Gerb. And so he goes, yeah, one of your whistleblowers you spoke to is correct. I went, who? Like who? And he's like, that should be enough. He just refused to elaborate. He didn't wink at me and said he had to like center himself a little bit before the before the hearing. So Jeremy, you know, sometimes I criticize his work a little bit. Everyone's work can be criticized. Everyone's work has flaws, but he was a really nice guy. I really enjoyed speaking to him. He was a kind of a class act. However, after the hearing, which we'll discuss a little more, he was pretty upset that he was the one who gave Congress on that day, the 12 page Immaculate Constellation Report. I think Schellenberger's witness gave it to Burchett a while ago, right? But I believe the situation was at this current day that Jeremy gave the Immaculate Constellation Report to Mace and others. So there was a point where Mace, in the starting to talk about the hearings, Jeremy started like getting visibly extremely upset, extremely upset. And afterwards, you know, he was like on the brink of tears. He was so furious. And you know, some people were talking and trying to get pictures. And he was being really nice about that. He was taking pictures with everybody, kind of being a class act. But I say, you know, I talked to Merrick on Renekamp. I said, hey, that's a good Jeremy. And so he explained the situation to me. And so I went up to talk to Jeremy because this will be coming out in a little bit, but I got to interview Rhett Burrelson afterwards. Herman was actually my fellow man there. We got some good questions about there. It's not a super long interview. However, some of the questions asked were on was he expecting other witnesses? Because I think somebody, somebody, jit boy, yeah, by the way, I talked to introduce myself to Oak Shane, and I'm planning to talk to him more. But yeah, some of the questions asked without spilling any details were, you know, seen if, sorry, just got to, okay, was seen if Burrelson had expected other witnesses, right? Because we all heard rumors of firsthand, you know, let me first hand guys, crash retrieval, legacy program witnesses asked him about that, asked him specifically about ARV, asked him specifically if he's read the Grush op ed, which, you know, I'm sure people really want to hear about that. And asked him specifically if Congress has received actionable intelligence as it started to move on some of these locations that have been named. Yeah. So Burrelson, in my opinion, along with Luna and Moskowitz actually asked the whole all the best questions of the the hearing. So before we get into hearing and discussing some of the questions, what was asked, a couple funny points per chat with killing diet Mountain Dew, the whole whole show, I think he had three diet Mountain Dews and like loves that Mountain Dew and Michael Gold was just eating candy the whole time. He had a Lenovo laptop that had the greasiest trackpad I ever saw. Jimmy, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Seriously. Falcon head. We talked about this just now, but Corbell was upset because he submitted the 12 page Immaculate Constellation report to Nancy Mace right before the hearing. And it was attributed to Schellenberger, not not Corbell, when the report was kind of entered into the congressional record, and he was furious about that. And there were only 11 pages, not 12. I think Jesse just tweeted the last page. Oh, really? Yeah, from Jeremy Kenyon locker Corbell. So if you guys want to see that go to Jesse Michael's page. And also now's a good time. I posted a picture of it talked about a little bit because you got to meet Jesse, everybody got to meet Jesse. Last week, I was just out in Austin for to record a show for Jesse. And so that should be out soon. There we talk about everything from crash retrievals to the McCandless story to ARV to deep underground military bases. I added in some we actually go a little bit into ed the witness from Edwards Air Force Base. And we talked a little bit about his background kind of referencing some of his public stations and so forth. So I think that's going to be really interesting. Let's uh, while you're looking at that, I think we got two questions here, including one with Joey had one year to force just one grush hostile witness or aerospace exec to the stand, but bring gold new Congress one. Yeah, so I think gold is people are pretty hot and cold about gold, right? Yeah. He, you know, he was really pro NASA, which I think NASA is likely at least somewhat privy to UAP crash retrieval programs. And NASA has historically lied about UAP as well, including a study in 1979 or 1980. It was a, sorry, 1978 or 1979. There were FOIA requests where NASA had previously stated they never looked into UAP, but a bunch of FOIA documents came out showing that NASA had been taking kind of an eye of UAP reports very seriously. So we will let's see what Joey says here. What's up, Joey? I thought someone quote for Chet St. Corbell was the guy who gave him a report months ago. I did hear something. Yeah, I did. I did as well that he was involved. Yeah. Additionally, have you so, Gurp, have you read the 12th page? You just skimmed it once. You know, yeah, it is. So it's a cover letter from George Jeremy Corbell. That was supposed to be the cover letter. And kind of talks a little bit about how he got the document and all that. But it's not like an additional page of the document. It's basically, it's, I believe Jeremy, you know, trying to, you know, convey that, you know, he's kind of a part of this effort, you know, in providing this report to Congress. I think that's what's really the meat of it. Yeah. Okay. I think someone in something in someone as well as Therose here both make good points. Well, you know, it's good to have a NASA guy calling for more transparency. It's still, you know, how much exactly can NASA be trusted. Also, this guy was connected with OSAP and Bigelow Aerospace. So why were questions not asked? And why was the topic not discussed about OSAP trying to kind of facilitate craft transfer from Lockheed Martin? Yeah, well, they didn't even name Lockheed Martin. I mean, Lou and others were quite afraid to even name it themselves. And then even like one of their Congress people was like, Oh, well, we know this is the Lockheed Martin case. And he said it out loud. But then when the response came back, it wasn't like, Oh, yeah, it was a con, they said it was a contract. Right. It was a contractor. But like, you know, as, as we've been kind of understanding the story over years, it's like, well, we know what that contractor is. So like, why are we being cagey about it? And where's the money trail? This is something we're digging. This is something that, there's something that Kermit, tracking down the financials of legacy programs we're trying to uncover. You know, there's reason to believe that sometimes programs are skimmed off of existing programs such as the F 35, a 1.5 to $2 trillion program that witness Ed served as a subject matter expert to various contracting companies after his time in reverse engineering programs at Air Force. Ed, this witness also stated while working on the R and D panel chain at the Pentagon that in two fiscal years, 34 billion and then 40 billion and non transfer of authority funds were kind of issued back channel to legacy programs under the Air Force. So kind of trying to track this stuff down, but let's see what two cents here. I have some, I have some sense on this as well. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So I think in terms of like funding, and we want to think about like kind of the avenues of what's kind of going on here, just over time, I think it's, you know, it would not surprise me if there's kind of a bunch of different things that are going on at play, because ultimately, right, you're just trying to obfuscate this financial data so that people that, you know, otherwise have that access to that information, they can't figure out what that money is actually going towards. Right. So I mean, in and of itself, the money trail is part of the obfuscation, trying to figure that out is about as important, I feel like is trying to see the crap and the bodies and all that stuff. So, you know, it's kind of one of those core tenets and, you know, the truth is out there, but I mean, I've been in this space for a year and a half, and I still have a bunch of different theories about it. So we can talk about it for sure. And that's why we're trying to kind of track down other people with a financial background like Kermit to really kind of make like a think tank on this subject, because I'm financially illiterate when it comes to tracking this stuff down. I can just report, like Witness Ed found $34 and $40 billion in non-TOA funds, but I can't really understand the significance of that or make heads or tails of a balance sheet. Yeah, because it's one thing for a witness to say, like, this is this is what I saw. But then, you know, that's the substantive evidence of like, I saw the ledger, I saw the transactions, this is corroborating basically that story. Right. Yeah, because yeah, Keegan was saying that's a lot of funds. Yes, it is. I mean, at the R&amp;D panel chain, he was overseeing over 200 billion per year in Air Force funds. Total just to kind of give everybody an idea, like when we talk about R&amp;D and IRAD, right? Humulatively, the United States government spends about $150 billion annually just on defense R&amp;D alone. That is a huge chunk of change. So, I mean, the number could be anywhere from zero to that or even something different than that entirely. We don't even know. Then there still exists the theory, and I don't know how we would explore this more, that some of these legacy programs, if they are being conducted out of a closed off military base, an underground base, perhaps they run off of closed systems. That's another possibility. Yeah, there are claims out there that some of these locations run off a cash-based system just as they do analog computers. Well, I'd be smart because you basically minimize the audit trail, you know, people, just like money talks, right? Right. So, people are spending money, if you have a, smaller the system and more closed than it is, the less chance that you have it of being uncovered. And we were at the Air and Space Museum today, and we were kind of hypothesizing, what if these programs with the craft like the ARV are able to just strip mine the asteroid belt for precious metals and so forth. Yeah, you don't even need to get capital or financing or anything here from earth, and you just get everything from your materials and products off world, then no one's the wiser, right? So, that makes sense. Two cents, thank you so much. Yeah, speaking of Seoul, Kermit and I will be going as well there. So, I know you guys are already showing Kermit a lot of love. We'll do another stream after Seoul as well. I can't wait to do that, and thank you again. Let me just, let me see this, and then we'll keep talking about the hearings. Thank you, Wag Boss, paying ties to the overlord. Now, I'll never be an overlord. Let's just hope John Jones gets knocked out this weekend, man, and I'll be a happy dude. So, you know, I'd like to say, and I'm sure we talked about this a little bit, I was impressed with Lou, not only with his testimony, but as a person as well. I was able to talk to him quite a bit, both before the hearings. I just bumped into him while I was scrambly to find the house building. I got coffee for a couple of friends. So, I'm just walking there. I see Lou outside. A guy followed by Kermas, and he's like two feet taller, I mean, two feet shorter than the rest of him. So, I know that's Lou, and I introduced myself and talked to him for a while. He was extremely kind. I think he did well answering questions as well into the congressional report. I've said this to you, and I'm sure you'll agree. There's still a lot of questions about Lou's background, ASAP and ATIP. Greenwald has diligently tried to get answers to for years, and how the heck are we going to get answers to what Lou's specific position was? Because now, of course, he has sworn into congressional testimony that he was a high-ranking member at ASAP, correct? Or was it ATIP? I'm just trying to remember off the top of my head. Well, I think that's the nature of the debate, is it not? I think in his book, he claims that he was part of both ASAP and ATIP. ASAP was kind of the initial effort where they were trying to get that divestiture from Lockheed, and then ATIP kind of was the effort post-ASAP once that kind of fell through. That's my understanding of it, at least. And I think one of the most consequential reports is Lou saying he cannot answer about being read into a congressional program. Yeah, that was quite telling. I thought that was very telling. So, Lou spoke at the UAPDF, which was kind of a closed event we were able to attend afterwards, and this speech saw fellow speeches by Representative Burleson and Representative Rounds. Senator Rounds. Yeah, sorry, Senator Rounds. So, this was a very consequential talk. I had some time to speak with Lou, because I know a long time ago I had kind of informed some friends that, via an analyst friend, that Lou would be agreeable to interview. Well, after this congressional testimony, I'd like to interview him now, actually interview him in person, because especially with his testimony, with Lou's media tour, I was kind of worried about not really being able to approach with fresh questions, because he's kind of answering everything. He's doing like 50 podcasts, but now I would really like to speak to him and just kind of ask him to expand on some of the things he said and kind of testified to. I think, number one, and I'm not going to be able to solve this on my platform, but to kind of clear up more issues around ATIP and OSAP. Yeah. It's like Katsky, Stratton, Kelleher. Everybody's got a little different bit of a different spin. Eric Davis. Well, they discussed Jay Stratton as well during the hearings too, and I think he's also coming out with his book imminently, not the name of it, but it's coming out quite soon. Well, hopefully we can talk to Eric Davis about this next week at Sol, right? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Because, first of all, I'd like to thank you so much, Siwan, for the $5. I really appreciate that. Sol is actually speaking at, or Schrock is speaking at Sol next week, and he's also doing a Q&amp;A. I believe it's with Eric Davis, right? Sounds right. Okay, so yeah, there should be some good stuff. Let me go through these, and we'll keep talking. Django, I love that pig. Thank you so much for the $15, and Fat Rodents, thank you very much. Does this change what you'll ask at Sol at all? Well, I'd like to interview some people at Sol, so we'll see what we can do there. I've talking with Kermit, we're trying to work out some stuff for him to you know, maybe go in a little bit more on some good camera equipment and actually travel around to get some good interviews, but not just interviews, right? Like actual documentaries spliced in with research and so forth, because interviewing Lou, I don't just want to sit in front of a camera with him for two hours, but add in research. So I'd just like to ask you, Kermit, what would, could you rank in terms of impact and efficacy and just all around feel, who do you think was the most consequential person to testify to least? And guys in the chat, give me a one through four, one being the most consequential, four being the least. That's a good question. I'd say probably most consequential. I don't know, my personal perspective of it is like the questions themselves are the controversial, you know, that was the provocative stuff. But in terms of people, I would say Gallaudet being there and being a representative from, you know, the Navy and Noah and being very high up in those positions, you know, he being a representative of U.S. military and that kind of cohort and then Elizondo representing military intelligence, Schellenberger being a journalist and then finally Michael Gold being a scientist, right? So it was like, I felt like the panel overall was very well stocked and it was diverse and it had all the people that we want to hear from about this subject. I think Gallaudet was probably, for me, I think that that was probably the most interesting, like those questions and those answers were probably the most interesting because we've heard from Lou, you know, from his books and interviews and all this stuff and he does discuss a lot of it and there was certainly some interesting things discussed today with him, sorry, yesterday. But I'd say Gallaudet, I also think Michael Gold, I was actually very impressed with the way that he kind of spoke about it and I think you spoke very positively about just like NASA collaborating on this in the future and just kind of moving past the stigma that we see with this topic and just trying to get, you know, the scientific community really to take this seriously and investigate it. So I would say Gallaudet and Michael Gold were my top two picks. I loved Lou, I loved what he got to say and I really, I was really impressed with the way that, you know, he presented himself and he was just being very, you know, frank with those responses as well and, you know, he can't talk outside of, you know, the documents and the things that he signed and, you know, all that stuff. So, and I know that's frustrating for a lot of people but I still thought it was very positive. I agree and, you know, I've seen a lot of bitterness online kind of about the efficacy of the hearings. I agree with everybody that I also expected, as did Burleson, first-hand retrieval witnesses or first-hand program witnesses. However, I, yeah, we won't, I'll wait, I'll say that before the interview with Burleson but just Burleson was expecting other people to testify as well or in place of, we didn't specify about that. But I do think one of the key takeaways here with Immaculate Constellation is kind of an existing proof now of DOD lying about a USAP. You know, the protocol for a USAP and unacknowledged special access program is deny, deny, deny. They can't even, they can't even say anything. You know, like even an admission or a denial would like. But if your back's against the wall then you misinform. That's the protocol. Deny. If you cannot deny anymore, you misinform. So, I think this was important to see because, you know, there's so many statements from Susan. Susan Goh is saying Immaculate Constellation is not a program and so forth. I do think the 12-page, you know, report, which is super interesting, which we'll get into in a little bit. You know, Kermit and I have been talking at length about one specific report from there and, of course, the term alien reproduction vehicle, which I kind of got on Schellenberger's a little bit case, a little bit for omitting from his congressional submission. But he didn't even mention that at all in his testimony, which I was a little bit disappointed of. And I even asked Jeremy about that. I said, hey, Jeremy, you know, why didn't he do that? He was like, well, you can just ask him why they lied. He was too hot under the collar to do that. We'll take a quick break, look at a couple of questions. What do you think about Nancy May's selling UFO brain and merch? I think it's a bad taste. Yeah, I will say, you know, seeing kind of the representatives and how they've kind of been tweeting about this, like that seems positive. But then, you know, seeing the merch that's being sold, it's just on the nose, you know, and it's like a UF, it's a shirt of like a UF phone. It's got Nancy May's like in it. I think it's bad taste. I think it's bad taste. I like this idea a lot, Magic, and I will absolutely ask him about it. So, okay, what's your guys' thoughts on the simulation hypothesis? Pretty interesting. Of course, there's a great podcast on the simulation hypothesis that kind of states that in the future, if the civilization has the computing power to conduct a simulation of a whole hypothesis, that means they won't just stop at one simulation. They will conduct numerous, possibly even infinite. And therefore, if there's infinite simulated hypotheses of universes in the future that yours is statistically more likely to be a simulated one. It's interesting, but, you know, I can't prove it. What do you say, Kerm? It's just too much bandwidth for me, man. I just show me an Excel file. He likes money. Yeah, he likes money. I'm into the credits. Show me a 10K. I mean, it's not, I wouldn't be surprised if that's, like, I feel like what Grush said last year, I think, is a pretty good, pretty good description. Holographic. Yeah, he's just like, whatever, he kind of had this line where he's like, you know, you kind of look in places in the universe. It seems like things are just a little too perfect. You know what I mean? And, you know, I don't know. I feel like that's kind of where I kind of stand with this. Like, you know, the more we kind of understand the world around us, it's like we really get to understand, like, why we're here and, like, what's the nature of existence. And yeah, what's interesting, though, is, you know, Rizwan Burke, he's going to be at the, he's going to be at Seoul, and he's going to give a discussion about the simulation. Ooh, that's going to be, we'll have to talk about that post. He also on Joe Rogan said he knew people in the legacy program as well. Diddy. Okay, we'll have to talk about that as well. So, Schellenberger, Lou, Gallaudet, and Gold, I think it was an extremely poor taste for Higgins or whoever it was that was trying to burn Schellenberger's whistleblower. Yeah, I wasn't, I don't know. I thought, I thought Higgins' line of questioning was like kind of half-baked a little bit. And I get, yeah, I get that you guys are trying to figure out what the source is. But like, at the end of the day, Schellenberger was literally said he was willing to go to jail to protect that source. So, you just got to respect that. So, Siwon, thank you again for the next five bucks, man. Yeah, Schrock. So, isn't just a former director of Skunkworks on the USAF advisory board. He probably did about know about the OSAP transfer. So, I really hope we can hear about that at Seoul. So, it would be very interesting to hear from him next week. Gold, Schellenberger, Gallaudet, Elizondo. I know something or someone, I know you're not the biggest Elizondo proponent. The thing that worried me the most about Gallaudet speaking was kind of reinforced. First of all, I loved Tim Gallaudet. Hermit can see, Tim's my boy, we spoke quite a bit. Super nice guy. I've talked to him a lot before he had seen the channel with the USO videos. But I was worried because when Chris Sharpe's reporting on Neuro and undersea crash retrievals came out with Wood Soul Ocean, a graphic institute, and Lockheed Martin Drys Immersible, I reached out to Gallaudet and I just said, hey, sir, can we talk about these underwater crash retrievals? And he told me, I don't know anything about it. And at that point, I rationed, okay, he's bound by NDA. He can't speak about this. It makes sense. I'll back off. But then, of course, at the hearing, he said he'd never signed an NDA towards anything. He did say that. Yeah. That does worry me a little bit. He doesn't know about USO retrievals. Harry, thank you very much. Who was your favorite during the breaks, meetups, and formal chats? Probably Burleson, to be honest. Yeah, I thought our conversation with Burleson, post hearing. And then he was also at the UAPDF, post party as well. We got some FaceTime there as well. It was really great talking to him. He's a sharp cat. We also got to talk to numerous house staffers as well. Oh, yeah. We'll get into that once we finish up the hearings. But we'll just say for now, we got a lot of business cards, which was great. Contact information was exchanged. Okay. Jim Chu says, on what impact, if any, will Trump have on deeper disclosure? I already think that he's making consequential moves by placing men like Rubio in power, which Rubio, of course, has been trying to subpoena and interview witnesses since at least 2008. And Matt Gaetz being the attorney general, that was just announced today. I think that's significant. I think he's setting up a pretty pro-disclosure cabinet. I know there's been a lot of talks as well with this Department of Government Efficiency, which seems to be more and more like a real thing. Elon Musk, Vivek, Rama Swamy, if you guys are watching this stream, I would love to join the effort in specifically trying to audit this legacy program activity. Hey, let's get this man in doge. That'd be pretty cool. So what stuck out to Throsey here was the idea of tracking ARVs. This implies that foreign ARVs are uncontrolled, domestic ARVs. I think both probably remember, this is something that even Congress really got wrong. Immaculate Constellation is not a legacy program. This was made in 2017 in an attempt to, I guess, umbrella over both legacy program and UAP. And it happened concurrent with Lou Elizondo coming out public with the New York Times order. So Immaculate Constellation would not have access. Members of Immaculate Constellation would not have read-on access to, let's say, the Air Force legacy program that tests ARV crap. Possibly. I mean, we don't really know how consolidated those databases are because it does talk about, I think, the overall structure of Immaculate Constellation is like a reporting. So it gets these UFO reports, this raw data that's coming in, and it silos it based on the imagery and the intelligence that they have behind that. So does that database also include stuff pre-2017? Well, I don't really know. But what I will say is, within the Immaculate Constellation report, this 11-page report, it does talk about imagery and human intelligence reports. And the scope of those encounters goes back to 1991. So that's pre-2017. So does Immaculate Constellation have that pre-2017 data? Maybe. It just really depends on what this author of this document had access to. And if it was all IC, Immaculate Constellation. Maybe. But I've also asked some of my friends who are analysts in satellite industry, so they could look back to 1974 for the Koyama incident, and they said, that's too far back. We have a cutoff. So I think for some of these space-based systems, that data is just not available. But I also do think that the programs are even between Army, Navy, and Air Force, probably the three largest legacy programs, that there's very little communication or cross-referencing between those programs. So it'd be interesting to find out who the witness of Schellenberger is, and who ran the Immaculate Constellation program. It was said that this was an individual in the executive branch. Possibly State Department. Possibly State Department. That's at least the witness, I think, Ross Goldhart has said. I think so. But I am of the mind that there are domestic ARBs that probably even the executive branch and Immaculate Constellation has no idea about. Yeah, but also I think probably the most interesting part is that we do have foreign intelligence of foreign ARBs, and those are included within the Immaculate Constellation report. And we have imagery and videos of this stuff. Specifically of the case that occurred over the Indo-Pacific region of a large black triangle, which if that's the case, you know, we were just at the Spy Museum and we saw some imagery of China ripping off and reverse engineering a predator drone. This would also mean that China ripped off and reverse engineered a TR3D. Hey, I do the same thing all the time. Kermit, here's a question for you, sir. There was some speculation regarding the involvement of Pacific architects and engineers outbidding OSAP for the locking materials. Anything there? That's a great question. Yeah, I so I've been referred to Pacific architects and engineers quite some times. As I understand it, they were later required by Lockheed Martin, I think. Yeah, I haven't really looked into it a ton. I know that they did become involved like post OSAP trans like that same timeline still exists. So very interesting, but I will say I think it's a fairly small organization. Like it's mostly like an engineering consulting services group that's I think less than a thousand, five thousand employees. I could be completely wrong here. But yeah, no, I know I know the name Pacific architects. I don't know a ton about it. But yeah, I'll just nod my head and smile. That just means follow up research. So that's awesome. Trump could pardon Trump could pardon anyone under UAP non-disclosure. I think amnesty should be truth and reconciliation. Yeah, truth. Unless it's a it's like a person that has killed somebody for the sake of secrecy. Yeah, like if these are not, I don't know. I don't even know if like the JSOC members in the 2004, if that's a true case, the blue on blue JSOC, we've been killed by Lockheed retrieval members, if that's a true case, and those guys are acting under strict orders. But I don't know if if you're a men in black assassin trying to who visited Mark McCandless's house in 2021, I don't know how much you should receive amnesty. It feels almost like it would be almost like a military version of a record case, right? Because it's like you have all these people working on these different programs following orders. But at the end of the day, who's really making decisions? So if you really want like full disclosure, truth and reconciliation, sending people to jail as well for, you know, illegal activity, I feel like the ultimate responsibility is like the people, you know, Depsec, whatever, that are in these high up positions making these orders, right? So who ultimately is responsible for that? I don't know. We don't know. We're still trying to figure that out. Maybe it's Cheney. He should have been in jail a long time ago. He's probably sits at the top of the pyramid. So Mace is a grifter. I'd like to get your opinion on this. I think she's more of just an opportunist who doesn't really understand maybe some context around UFOs and kind of the disinformating cartoonists and grifters, if you want to call him that. So I understand like calling calling grifter just from seeing the shirt. I totally understand it. But okay, calling calling Mace a grifter. I just I think it's just the poor taste of her. Yeah, it's just poor. I think it's just poor taste. And honestly, I think it's probably like a staffer or something. Yeah. That's, Hey, you know, we're trying to have some UFO brain and merch out there so that, you know, our constituents know, you know, this is this will be. Yeah. So Siwan, thank you again. You talked to a staffer at that the committee had heard about Schrock and his story. Not sure why he didn't testify. I was thinking, yeah, once I once I'd saw a truck was going to talk at Seoul, I was assuming he was going to be one of the witnesses today. That was very surprising for me. So one of the things at Seoul is there's some time for meet and greets and so forth along with the Q&amp;A. So we will I promise you try and pull Schrock for an interview. I would do anything for that. So we'll scroll down here. So this is talking a little bit throws. He's talking a little bit more about Mace. They're selling a platform for fundraising for Republicans. But yes, bad taste. Okay. We all agree there. So here's a question or statement from Hokey. It would be interesting for you to talk with the lawyer in the military space. What are the potential legal mechanisms? 1950s era executive orders, DOE exceptions that could keep this hushed up. I didn't like being a good person to us to talk to. Yeah. And then also, I mean, this is, I mean, at least in the legal financial area, right? Like there's a bunch of stuff in, you know, the SEC Act, the Code of Federal Regulations that allow not just for like the president, but also like to your point, right, Department of Energy, they can provide like the executive agencies can provide these exemptions specifically for corporations or people or agencies that are involved in, you know, above black or above board activities like that. So I'm just trying to look at the questions because then we'll get back to the hearings. So Nell, I only heard from the disclosure Mike account, and he was also talking about other witnesses, like firsthand triangle witnesses. So maybe this was, maybe his sources were a little bit behind. Maybe there was something that was supposed to happen. But no, I personally heard none of Nell supposing to have testified. Yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to hear him. Okay. Sorry. Okay. A question about Michael, does he know when he'll be able to go back to the black side? I do not know. I have no idea. Michael used to work at Bigelow and that wasn't mentioned in his bio. Also NASA is the, yeah, I've ever worked for NASA is not transparent. I can give you guys, I mean, I think I've talked about it multiple times, like in the Moon dust video where NASA has lied. Anyone see SAIC took its biggest one day loss today? No, actually, today, today with post earnings, what's going on here? Oh no. I don't know. Yeah. Well, let Kermit pull that up while I get, while I get the next question. The one day we go run the streets looking at museums, the SAIC tanks. How did I have such a great seat? I had a good friend who helped me get media for this really good friend. I'm very thankful too. And so I owe all of that to that, that person. Have you guys read the 11 page paper? Yes, we're about to talk about it too once we finish up with the hearings as well. Okay, let's see. Eli, shout out event horizon. It's not just at SAIC. It's actually a, so what's going on with SAIC is actually being seen at Litos, Amentum and a couple other defense primes. It seems to be some type of uncertainty in the defense market at its current, at this current moment. I wonder what's causing that. I wonder what's causing that. I'm just looking for, for triangles. Siwon, thank you. You are giving a lot of cash. Thank you so much, man. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Thank you as well, Jimmy Shoe. I'm looking for questions right now, guys. Yeah, I think I saw this as well to Douglas Dean Johnson and Kirkpatrick provided several points too. I don't know, Debunk, I think he might have raised some interesting points. I haven't fully read what, what he said. Yeah, so his, his belief, right, I think it's kind of just scrutinizing and assessing this document, right? So first off, this is written by somebody in the Department of Defense and then was approved by the Department of State Public Affairs. Kirkpatrick basically said in his response, this is completely bogus. This is completely made up. This isn't what happens. Not to mention, this 11 page document is not on any official letterhead. It does not seem to be any sort of like, formalized or standard report memo. Otherwise, it's coming out officially of an agency. This seems like, I don't know, like it could be somebody typing up this report. Is this somebody in the government? Is this somebody that's not in the government? Ultimately, we don't, we don't really entirely know, but I think some of the things that we would expect from government documents are absent from this 11 page report. And then especially now that it's been entered into the congressional record and everyone's kind of talking about it, it's like, obviously, the scrutiny has just increased. Yeah. Yeah. So how did the panel get selected? Felt more like a variety show, which I agree with you. I have no idea how the panel got selected. All I know is that for this hearing specifically from Burleson, as well as a person I talked to connected with the intelligence community at the UAPDF, there have been other instances where witnesses were intimidated almost like up to the time they were supposed to, supposed to testify. So, you know, I'm not exactly sure the issues here, but I don't know how this was selected. I mean, I probably would have chosen a little bit of a different lineup or possibly even more witnesses, but, you know, I'm not necessarily sure. I felt like they did a good job just, again, kind of selecting a group of people that kind of represented different aspects kind of of this. And you have like naval intelligence, you know, journalism, science. I thought that that was a pretty good mix of people. Right. I do think that the hearings were varied enough from last years. However, we need first-hand, not first-hand experiencers, but first-hand whistleblowers involved. Like touch the craft. You've been in the basement, you've seen the stuff. Yes. But I don't know, saying you've seen the stuff, mentioning the technologies and mentioning the locations would then be violating your special access programs that you've been read into in legacy. So the consequences for that would likely be severe. Yeah. And I imagine those are the type of people that would be told on their way to testify, to turn back or bad things will happen. Yeah, that could be happening. Crackerjack, thank you so much for the 20 big month. It is a big month. We got a lot of stuff and we still got soul coming up. Traveling across the country for UAPs. So, sorry, I'm just looking at, did you already talk about the Kuwait UAP that Sheldon Berger mentioned? Not yet, which we will. I'd also, in the report, which I thought was interesting, was the mention of the Orbs flying circles around the F-22s, right? Yep. And then also, I think that same incident at the Orbs escorted the F-22 out of the missionary. So this pilot is on their way to do this mission. And then all of a sudden, they get surrounded by Orbs that are doing all these tricks around it. And then the Orbs are like, get out. As I was reading that report, I'm just trying to picture it for myself. I'm like, that's got to be airing on. And that reminds me of the Donald Trump on JRE, who talks about speaking to F-22 pilots who observe. Yeah, specifically F-22. So do those correlate? I don't think it's a stretch to say yes. William, I've been awesome, man. How are you doing? Sorry I've been a little dark between Jesse and this and soul has so much going on. I do have a project coming out and it should be within the week that I'm really excited. Really excited. Yes, we talked about this. It appears the report came from Corbell, not Schellenberger. A lot of drama around there. Schellenberger just had an interview with Jesse. I haven't had the opportunity to watch it yet, but I would like to see that. I would like to see that. So let me just look for questions here, guys, so then we'll keep talking. You guys asked so many great questions, especially the stuff of current. Keep them coming. So yeah. Have you seen the Beyond Paradigm podcast with putoff and graves? Do you think that it's important that somebody who just worked with putoff just testified? I have not seen the podcast with putoff and graves. Have you? I would like to watch it though, because we've got to meet Ryan Graves as well, and he's extremely kind. What's the chatter with the grush op-ed? Well, Burleson will make some comments on it, but he thought the reason as to why the American public has not seen it yet was not his place to say, but he did have some comments on it, which is pretty interesting. Okay, perfect. Thank you for putting the question. How was the UAPDF dinner? Any key points there that caught your attention? Did congressional individuals and staffer show interest? Thank you. That's a perfect segue question. So Lester Nair, guys, if you guys, you guys probably all know Lester Nair. If you don't, I'd really follow him. He's a member of UAP Caucus, brilliant individual. This morning he tweeted, I have a lot of thoughts about yesterday. I'll just start with saying being here in person is like seeing the situation in full color, watching only the hearings and not all the things happening in real life before and after around it. It's like watching it in black and white. And this is a statement we've talked about. I couldn't agree more with guys. The hearings were good. I love the time there, but I was blown away by UAPDF. Seeing the House and congressional interest and support from both Republicans and Democrats, seeing the unity around some individuals, seeing members connected with the intelligence community. There were numerous staffers as well that we just talked about that Kermit and I connected with a lot of business cards to speak to staffers who are really interested in the subject. And I'll keep going on, but give me your thoughts on UAPDF. Yeah. First off, I just want to say Lester Nair, thank you kindly for letting us in. It was extraordinary just to be able to just be amongst everybody and just have the opportunity just to be able to attend and get to talk to everybody. Yeah. I mean, pretty much a lot of the witnesses were there. A lot of people around them, Ryan Graves, who attended the hearings and was also at the UAPDF. And then some of the representatives, Senator Rounds, gave the opening address and actually awarded Lou Elizondo a framed copy of the legislation that was cool to the NDAA last year, which I think that that speaks volumes to the support and just the persistence, just kind of the persistence that Senator Rounds and these people in Congress have about really trying to get transparency and enacting legislation to get that. And none of them are like, like none of them are kooky or dubious characters as Green Street would say. Burrelson went on stage. He said, guys, like I've said this before, I'll say it again. I'm skeptic about everything. But there's obvious blockages here from places outside of Congress. And I want to get to the bottom of this and so forth. So these guys are all saying that they don't have all the pieces, but they're pretty darn open-minded. We'll just say Burrelson has not been at rest since Brush spoke last year. He has not been just relaxing and chilling. Either has Birchette and other people. We got the board of directors for the UAP-DF, including Gary Nolan, Nell and Elizondo, the advisory board, Timothy Gallaudet, Chris Mellon, Kirk McConnell. Interesting about Chris Mellon. We went to the art museum today and the Mellon family donated all of the best pieces there. Substantially all, yeah. And we got a document here, an actual picture of the six observables of UAP craft, including positive lift, hypersonic velocities, instantaneous acceleration, low observability, trans-medium travel and biological effects. But what I would just like to say about the UAP-DF is there were some individuals there that I have wanted to connect to for a very long time that I finally got the chance to sit and speak with. And I couldn't be happier. So do we want to talk about, I guess, our conversation with Leslie? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll talk about Leslie Kane a little bit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How was that conversation? So for the Brad Swarinson ARV project, analyzing emails and transcripts, I found one mention that between 2000 and 2003, Mark had sent Leslie Kane a copy of Fluxliner as drawn by Brad. And so I bring this up to Leslie Kane and she couldn't remember it because at that time she was working with Greer. She didn't talk to McCandlishe after 2004 when she left with Greer, didn't know all about that. And so asked me to explain. And Leslie Kane kind of had no idea of the Brad Swarinson interview with Aviation Week in Space Technology. And so Shera and I were talking for like 10 minutes straight. She was gobsmacked about the death threats from Swarinson. She couldn't believe it. But then she and I were talking about that. We were talking about the Edwards case and Wittness Ed, Kexburg as well. And Leslie Kane is just one of the smartest, nicest people I've ever spoken to. There was a group of journalists nearby. I sat near them at the press conference and they were kind of hounding around, really nice people kind of wanting to get a picture of what was going on. So then afterwards they talked to me for like 30 minutes on how I source methods. But Leslie Kane was so cool to talk to. She's so small and she's so cute with her like, gray hair that's puffing out in every direction. It was, it was really fantastic just watching y'all both just go and add it on Kexburg and Torrance and it was just, it was like a meeting of the minds and I was just like, I was just blessed just to like sit and watch it, you know? Because she stepped away from the case for a while. I think with, I think with a lot of journalists, and it makes sense, right? When you have to, you know, meet a quota for maybe a publication or some forth, at some point, you got to step away from the case. Yeah. And so with Kexburg, you know, Kexburg, I think she hit a dead end, which I understand too, because I also told her about kind of Romansky and some of the FOIA dead ends with talking to his kids who he mentioned on the Jim Montell show, words of night access to, or told not to speak about Romansky. So in my opinion, Kexburg has hit someone of a dead end, but, you know, her eyes kind of lit up when I told her about the Sorens and stuff, because, you know, that case really is alive and well, especially with ARV and Immaculate Constellation. But yeah, I mean, it's made the new cycle yet again. And as we know, this, the, the McCandler Sorens and Story is one of the original like sources of the ARV reproduction vehicle concept. So, you know, if we, if, if we really want to understand the ARV and the RV, man, like we need to, we need to, we need, I don't know, we need to drag people in and start getting them testified. Well, and I really need to stress this, because I think Corbell and Knapp discussed this as well as some others. The term, excuse me, ARV did not originate with Greer. This UFO researcher, Bill Hamilton was the first person to ever speak about ARV. And this term was given to him by Brad and Bill Scott. And in 1991, he was the first one to publish the term ARV to text unrelated to the story. I think he made a misprint here. He called it an alien replicated vehicle, not alien reproduction vehicle, but use the term ARV. And so in my tweet where I kind of called out Schellenberger a little bit for saying, Hey, why did you take this out? It's because ARV is not attributing alien and extra terrestrials to this vehicle. ARV is the specific term. It's like the brand name, like Sprite to lemon line soda that Brad Sorensen was told by the individual showing off the craft at Northern Air Force Base, which is a story, I believe to be true. ARV specifically was said, these are alien reproduction vehicles. So, you know, by saying alien reproduction vehicle, it's not just extraterrestrial. It's a, I hate to use this word because I think it's overused, but it is a kind of a nuance term, right? Yeah. But so Leslie Kane, I'm sending her some of the ARV stuff and she and I are going to get cracking and talk a little bit more about that. So it's exciting. If I could get her on the show or talk to her, because we were waiting for like 20 minutes to speak to her. There were some chatty Cathy speaking to her right before we got up. And it's okay. I mean, for some people like us, it's, it's a little shocking to be in kind of a mixture with some of the people we were around. Yeah, I would say overall, it just felt very surreal. I mean, for me, you know, this is, I guess the first time I've come out and like, Hey, I'm Kermit, I'm probably probably about years or whatever. And then also just seeing a lot of people that have been like following and talking with like on Twitter, Reddit, you know, all these different social media platforms and then seeing a lot of those people in person. And then like, you know, the UAPDF party, it's like, you know, who are kind of worried if we weren't, if we're going to get in or not, it was all this, you know, kind of anxiety about it. And then just being in the room, it was like, at first part, I was just like anxious because I'm like, geez, like, I'm so out of place. But I also just felt like just so happy and just so blessed just to like have, have that experience. Everybody there was brilliant. Everybody there had something to offer and talk about. And it was just a really special group of people. It was really darn cool. Absolutely. And it was really cool. I also, we got to talk to James Fox quite a bit as well. Really excited for the program. We're going to see that next week at Sol. But James Fox is one cool dude out on Apple TV, November, December 15. I think so. He is one cool dude guys. James Fox is awesome to talk to. Yep. We were, yeah, we, we talked a lot about that. And then also just going to Sol and, you know, just his doc, like his, his work with Virginia a little bit as well. So fantastic guy. I would say a lot of the people that we met yesterday were very nice. You know, they're very interested in talking to us and learning from our perspective and our experience and kind of like, you know, our reason, our why of like being this topic. So I found it pretty cool because I find as like a content creator in the sphere, there's a lot of like hoarding of information, I would say, and kind of unwillingness to share and collaborate. So being around this group of people who are just so willing to speak and talk was, was really cool. You know, so many people asked me like, who do I work for? They say nobody. I, you know, I work for myself. I'm just here because I'm intellectually curious about aliens. Yeah. Some people would kind of give a look at like, really? Yeah. Like Burlton asked me that and I just know like I'm self published. I just create documentaries. And so that was, that was really cool guys. I'm on a first name basis with Rhett Burlton. Did you notice the witnesses were as nervous in person as they appeared on TV? I understand it's a nerve wracking situation, but they seem very nervous. To me, they did not look nervous at all. The most nervous person was Jeremy Cordell. I wasn't in the room. So I wouldn't know. I will say, I mean, they didn't seem nervous at least when I got to meet a lot of them at the UAPDF. You know, if these people are all engaged in some massive psychological operation, they're doing a really, really good job of it. Because it did not seem like they were engaged in fraud or anything like that. And I think Michael Gold had one heck of a time because he was a, he was just kind of eating candy the whole time. And then afterwards I got to speak to him and he was just so, he was like all smiles that he got to talk. So, you know, it's always nice meeting the men behind the mics and talking to these people. Well, I mean, there's certainly, I had been a little harsh, I think, on loot lately with some of the presentation stuff and just sort of the questions that still remain and are really valid about his background, as well as his work at CIFA, the Counterintelligence Field Activity. But, you know, meeting and talking to these people was really great. So, yes, okay. While this part was people reporting loss of time and feelings of unease, let's remember the story of Jonathan Wagan, who in 1997 in Peru, when he and his fellow Marines allegedly found a crash saucer as they got within close proximity, they felt like intense fear and unease. And, you know, if the infographics whistleblower story is true, crash retrieval operators have to have grounding mechanisms because your cognition is so affected. Well, it's a, yeah, I've heard from other people's experiences as well that loss of time is actually quite common. I think there's something to do with the warping of gravity and time and just how that affects our perception. That definitely tracks. There's another point I was going to say to that, but I'm completely blanking on it. Is it about fear or? Fear. Oh, actually, what I was going to say is, you know, actually, the loss of time is also featured in the X-Files, too. Whenever Fox Motor, whenever he has these encounters, if you see his, you know, extraterrestrial vehicle, he'll check his watch because he's trying to see if the, you know, the timer's gone. So I don't know. I, I, I sort of watched the X-Files after I really started getting into UAPs and I'm like, interesting. Like, this is talking, this is a lot of the stuff I've been like researching it. This is a little on the nose. X-Files is a big thing. What's going on? And I'll talk about one very specific thing in the X-Files in my next video. How much of the UAP topic occupies your daily life researching, editing? If I'm not with the girlfriend talking to Kermit on the phone, training Jiu Jitsu, lifting weights or doing other work, I'm doing this. So and I know you didn't ask me, but what I will say is it's probably, it is my, it is my intellectual curiosity. So after, after work, after dinner, after I'm done hanging out with my friends and watching Instagram reels, I'm scrolling the CIA's reading room and the Navy's reading room as well. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I'll say if I'm not, this takes up probably most of my time outside the lady. I always have like nine or 10 PDFs. I'm reading escape velocity. Thank you so much. This is for our, oh, thank you. Let's catch up soon. Absolutely. Thank you so much. I appreciate it, man. I appreciate it a lot. And yes, sorry I missed your call today. It's been hectic as been very hectic, dude, but thank you so much. Levi, it was nice to meet you too, man. Wanted to ask if you got any impressions hearing roundspeak at the UAPDA would be reintroduced independently. I wouldn't be surprised. He mentioned it a couple of times. There seems to be very strong support. Yeah. To reintroduce seems to be a little bit of spite that it wasn't passed. Yeah. He seemed pretty unhappy. So it was mentioned a lot. So Juan, thank you again, dude. Holy cow. Do you believe SSCI know some UAPs are NHI and are aware of the legacy program? Senate probably. Yeah. Senate probably. Especially House, I think like a house is really still trying to get answers on this. But as far as we know, Senate has been on this trail. Like they had almost a year, a six months to a year head start over the house and their investigations. Yeah. That's at least what I was told. Okay. This is a good question. What alleged NHI technology would you both like to most know everything about things? I would like, I don't, that's actually a tough one. I've grappled with this question a lot. So I'll let you go first, Grimmit. You just throw me the. Yeah, you go first, man. I want to, I think the electrogravity is probably the first thing I want to look at. I want to, I just, I just want to know like if it was actually a thing, you know, also just by the way, like, come on. So the B2, I don't know if you guys know this, but the B2 has a technology on board. I think it's called the inertial mass reduction or something like that. Basically, it uses like electromagnetic, like high voltage electricity through the wings to reduce the weight of the airframe. So it's like less, less, less heavy in the air. So it's a little bit more maneuverable. I just think that's very interesting, you know, up to I think, and that's basically electrogravity. If you want to, if you want to kind of think about it like that. I mean, I'm not a scientist. Again, I'm going to count it. But that's probably one of the first things I would be interested in. I'd say novel propulsion and then energy would be the next one. Like how, how is that propulsion like being energized? That's kind of one and two for me. So specific technology, because I can't really go with the craft, I would like to know about the piece of technology that RA described that was the weapons technology. The tablet? Yes. That was showing the symbology. He didn't know if it was in his head or not. So that, that would, that would be one of mine. Sorry. Sorry, getting through these and I'm going through. Thank you. Will be Milo. Pretty impressive. You are pretty impressive. Thank you so much. And so one again. Thank you, dude. Holy cow. And Chris Sharp collab would go insane. Well, you know, Chris Sharp wasn't there, but I got to make a heck of a lot of connections. So I would love to talk crash retrievals with Sharp. In fact, you know, I'd like to meet him in person. So, you know, maybe we'll get a London trip going in because I'd really like to meet him. UAP is across the pond. So JC was not testifying. That is an interesting observation. Why would he be nervous? I don't know, but he just, when I was talking to him before the hearings, he was just like, okay, now I need to center myself a little bit. So. Oh, okay. I just, I didn't, I didn't know what JC was at first. Did you talk with anyone about remote viewing? Yeah, quite a bit. Specifically, Chris from Area 52 channel. He was with, he's really cool, by the way. You got to talk to him too from Area 52. He actually says he has had experience with remote viewing. So I'm going to link up and talk with him and, you know, see if he can do some, some sort of demonstrations or proof of concept because, you know, I'm sure you feel kind of the same, same way as me, but this is one of the toughest things for me to grab my head around and grapple just because I'm so unfamiliar with the topic. Yeah. The only time it was really discussed was kind of talking about like Ed May's work in the 1990s and how that got transferred into that certain private corporation that we're interested in. Was it Mays or Luna that also talked about craft flown with mind? Bind body. That was craft connection. Luna, I think was mind body. She said it was a mind body connection. That was interesting. That was very interesting. Okay. This is just a comment. Diana Posolka said on a pod, Tim Taylor, AKA Tyler told her ex files had real consultants from the program. Yep. Yeah. I would agree. I would agree with this. Holy crap. Snapple. Thank you so much. BJJ practitioners. Where do you train? I mean, that is just so kind of you. Thank you. I'll be sharing this loop with my boy Kermit here. Thank you so much. Sorry. I'm just looking at, okay, questions. Yes. Thank you guys. What actions moving forward? Are you guys looking for Congress to take and what would indicate action on the information to discuss discussed in this hearing? That's a great question. For me specifically, what actions moving forward? Witnesses need to be subpoenaed and this needs to be done in a setting outside of Arrow. I spoke with Burleson about this and there are witnesses. I have talked about publicly and not publicly that information has been passed on for him to get subpoenaed. Yeah. I feel like the more interesting people to talk to at this point are the ones that are not going to be super cooperative because I think the majority of them are probably a little bit more in the know than people that are more transparent about this. That's just my take on this. I also want to see Congress actually investigating the forensic audit trail. I want them either getting a GAO audit done, a DOGE audit, this Department of Government Efficiency stuff. I want them to start making progress on figuring out how the funding is happening and if there's taxpayer dollars or private money that's involved because I think ultimately that's I think the American people deserve to know and the Congress people themselves said it multiple times like we are going to find out about this. That's something I want them desperately to follow up on. I think this is a good question. Why do you think we haven't seen any new evidence like videos or pics? Of course, you could reference why a lot of people I think are kind of disappointed there wasn't such evidence shown at the hearings. However, I think the info here is a little bit more complicated because if we're talking about immaculate constellation, for example, and some of the imagery there, Kermit talked about this earlier, but it's not like a satellite feeds are giving you a steady 4K recording picture. No, you're giving data. You're just giving streams of data and I think anomalies are noticed in the data for objects in picture or there's various conditions to kind of identify what the satellite systems for NRO and NGA and stuff are looking at. At this point, this data is filtered and if it's picked up by immaculate constellation and so forth, it's siloed away quickly. Another thing I'll add as well is like if you're just looking at ARRO and you're looking at the progress that ARRO has made, by the way, they just released a new report, a historical records report, where they talked about some of the new cases and morphology and the progress that ARRO has been making. I like the report. I'm curious to know what the chat's thoughts are this evening about that as well, but what I will say is ARRO has indicated they are building more instrument platforms and so I think as they're starting to build, I think it was called the Gremlin system, which is like hyper spectral imagery. As these offices and as other organizations start to parse that data and they start to look at that and they can take intelligence from it, they can scrub it to make sure there's no classified information, I think we're going to start to see that going forward, but I think it's really just been the instruments, the technology to see this stuff, it's just had to catch up recently. And then somebody asked the question and you relate it, which is a good question. If Sean Kirkpatrick saw no, thought all UAP was prosaic, why have these Gremlin systems and advanced sensory data have been introduced? That was a random question from a random person on Twitter, but I thought it was a very, very good question because it's like Kirkpatrick, when he was running ARRO, he had the main line narrative of most, if not all UAP are prosaic, the people that are witnesses are either misinformed or they're providing disinformation to Congress for their own financial benefit, whatever. But at the same breath, it's like, okay, Kirkpatrick, you're saying UFOs aren't real, but you're spending a bunch of money on cameras that can look at things that aren't visible to the human eye. Why? And speaking of Kirkpatrick, I thought it was mighty funny to see Tim go after Kirkpatrick in both his testimony and congressional submission and Kirkpatrick kind of fire back like it was a high school drama. He's just mad, I didn't hire him. Kirkpatrick is so hot under the collar. I'm sure everybody here has seen his interview on Event Horizon. Kirkpatrick is just, he never makes himself look good. Well, let's not forget his LinkedIn letter after the Grush hearing that posted the same day after the multi-date Grush. He was so petty with Grush. Yeah. So Area 52 has been going over the 4chan leak from last year. Very interesting stuff. What are your thoughts on it? My thoughts are I plan to make a full video about it because there's just a lot of interesting tidbits. The 4chan leaker? Yeah, the 4chan leaker, if nobody knows, it's an alleged testimony off of 4chan, which of course is going to raise some red flags because 4chan is kind of just a place for a lot of self-deprecating funny people to post about wild stuff. But the theory behind this is that there's basically a hamburger-shaped self-replicating craft that patrols our ocean non-human that custom builds UAP for specific mission purposes. And this is part of the reason that crash is occurring, thus retrievals, because this specific facility generally doesn't care what happens to its used up product. Well, it's because the UFOs that are coming from this area, whatever this craft is, they seem to be just built for spec, built for that mission. And so it's almost disposable, right? So sometimes these things aren't perfectly built. They crash and then we pick it up. My take on it is that that story is very interesting and it sounds like something the United States maybe would be very interested in doing, but I'll say no more. So William says, do you think it will be different on the issues of UFOs now that Trump is president? Absolutely. I personally do. Just because I think part of it he has spoken about UFOs openly, so I think he'll be more receptive and reporters and media will be more interested to ask him. And I think with some of the people he's positioned in power might be far more willing to work with him. We'll see how Marco Rubio works with Trump. Trump used to call him Little Marco. Yeah, but I feel like that was a lot of just political swagger. He's just trying to beat Rubio on the election. I don't think he holds that against him. He's just teasing him, I don't know. But I will say Trump has indicated that he's not only interested in getting disclosure about UAPs, but also like the JFK records, 9-11, all these other issues and things that we've been talking about in terms of improper government oversight or possible malfeasance. He wants truth on not just UAPs, just like truth in general. I think that that's a good idea of what we're going to see the next four years. So Shardful, what are your thoughts on Boebert talking about the rumors on the Hill about DoD involved in genetic manipulation? Interesting. First of all, I thought her line of speaking, like I understand a lot of people right after election want to bring some political jargon into something, but I thought her talking about the last election and so forth was a little bit of a poor taste. It's already difficult to get the subject taken seriously. So you want questions as directed and purposeful as possible, talking about birds being drones. Birds aren't real. Yeah, when you say that, it's just you're making it disingenuous and it honestly felt like the lines of questioning prior to Boebert taking the stage. It was very good. It was leading somewhere. There were some very interesting things and then all of a sudden Boebert gets up and is like birds aren't real and Biden got 81 million votes and it felt for a brief moment like the air was sucked out and the energy was sucked out for a minute. Maybe there is some interesting research to be done about genetic manipulation, but now that she said that, that's associated with conspiracies like birds. Yeah, but it makes you wonder like, okay, Boebert is at least aware of this, but is the other part of the UAP caucus like as Burleson, as Birchhead, as Moskowitz, as Luna, the guys that we know on the Hill that are interested in this, are they also hearing about this too? Because I know Colt's heart, he speculated on his live stream. I don't know the speculation, but kind of saying like, watch this space a little bit because it seems that there are possibly credible allegations about a hybridization program that have reached Congress and that might be something that will be talked about in further hearings. I think GS15 John Ramirez has talked about that on public forums as well. I can't quite remember, but Truthsau says, who specifically would use a peanut to testify? One, Ed from Edwards. Two and three, I can't necessarily say. What about you, Kermit? Probably Deputy Secretary David Turk of the Department of Energy. Oh, we walked by the DOE today. We did walk by the Forest Hall building. We took pictures outside the James Forest Hall Department of Energy building to make chat. It was a great time. Yeah, I would subpoena. Definitely, without naming names, some folks in the Air Force that oversee experimental test wings at Edwards and the Deputy Director of, sorry, the Director of Global Acts, Office of Global Acts. Those are my top three. Or, thank you so much for the 50s. This is for my boys, 10 and 12. Well, thank you. That's extremely nice. Role model and inspiration, thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words and also extend those same courtesy to Kermit because he is killing it. You're getting a lot of love on this show too, man. Thank you so much. Falcon, Ed, do you think Avi Loeb is an ally or not? Yes, I have a friend who speaks extremely highly of Avi and are trying to maybe facilitate a meeting with himself and me. I'd really like to talk to him. Do you have any thoughts on Avi? I think he's doing a really, really good thing. I think it's so great that the same organization that John Mack was a part of and there was a lot of issues with his internal review. Now, Harvard is kind of supporting Avi Loeb having a more serious inquiry into the major light craft. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just saying, generally, just looking at how Harvard treats their staff is they're a little bit more open to Avi having this discussion versus how they were with Mack decades ago. This is my take. Yeah, I think very highly of Avi. Remember when James Clapper lied about mass surveillance to the Congress and nothing happened? Yes. It seems like that's talked about quite a lot. They lie about a bunch of stuff. Okay. Sorry, guys. Just looking for some questions. The chat here is always excellent. That's why I'm trying to look specifically for questions. Yeah, they're awesome. Just because there's a lot of good discussion. Carl Nell and Admiral Wilson. Yeah, that's another. Oh, what do I think of the work Jesse Michaels is doing? I think Jesse is fantastic and he's one of the best voices in the space. I've got to grow to be friends with him over the last couple of months and, of course, hang out with him in person. Jesse is wonderful and he is really, really driven to make change in this field. He is a very solid person. Jesse's just got his own style too, man. We talked about this earlier, but nobody else could show up to the hearings in just like a more laxed fit. If anybody did it, but Jesse, they would look a bit strange. I think we're towards the end now. Keep submitting those questions. Otherwise, we'll just keep chatting about the Immaculate Constellation Report, which we'll get into. You'd go with the DOE people too and former CA, Office of Global Access. Yeah, Gaffney would be good. However, I think the names from Wilson Davis, the senior review group, and specifically would be very good. I would subpoena the sec depths from the 90s. I think Terry was one of them that was talked about who might have had purview because I think he was undersecretary of research and development for DODs, so he would have probably had purview in the early 90s, late 80s. So we're at a little bit of a good point in the questions now. You want to talk a little bit about the Immaculate Constellation Report? Absolutely. There's one report that you have been mulling over in your head a lot. Can you tell us about that case? Absolutely. There's the iPad. We got it up right there. So for those of you guys following at home, we're talking about specifically the cases in Section 2, the US government imagery intelligence. Let me pull up a second screen. How about that? Okay. And while we do that, I can have it right here. Okay, we got Max Farr. Thank you, Max. Max Farr is a good friend of both of us. How's it going, sir? Yeah, now that we have ARBs mentioned in Immaculate Constellation, the time is nigh. I got to say I am thrilled that the term ARB is fully in the report. I think that's excellent. Yeah, just quickly read it. So something that, you know, just reading all these different reports and the examples of just the imagery intelligence that's included within the database of Immaculate Constellation, I'll say a lot of these reports are very interesting and eye-opening, but there's one that I'm very interested to see if we can get either a FOIA request or like any sort of follow-up on this because this would seem like a crazy video. Okay, let me just read the description. On U.S. government networks, there exists OPIR footage of a large saucer-shaped UAP emerging from within a dense cloud formation. The saucer registered black-hot against white-cold with atmospheric disturbances caused by the saucer-shaped UAP visible. The saucer was between 200 to 400 meters in circumference and displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface, so I think like a dome on top. After breaking above the cloud cover, the saucer-shaped UAP suddenly reverses its direction, descending partially back into the cloud cover, then accelerating rapidly out of frame and partially obscured by the cloud tops. This behavior was evasive in nature and implied that the saucer-shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space-based collection platform. Now, when I read that, I'm like, it's just like, I'm picturing this and, you know, I'm kind of thinking about the movie NOPE, which was by Jordan Peele. Jordan Peele, and it's a, you know, horror movie with like an alien vehicle that's like living and it eats people whatever. But the common theme of that movie is like, you know, it's in a cloud. It's this white vehicle that's like in this cloud. And as I'm like picturing it, I can almost see it as just this giant saucer. It's like coming in and out of the clouds. And it's, you know, as we also talk about, you know, reporting and trying to identify UAP, it seems that these things are either manipulating or, you know, changing their kind of imagery or like how they present themselves so that we're not aware of them or they're just trying to conceal their nature. So like this disc flying like in the clouds because it doesn't want to be seen by a satellite, like that's kind of crazy. That's kind of crazy. And then further, like what is the, I guess, what is the, what's the video here? Is this like a video from the ground, from a helicopter? Yeah, from ground or a satellite imagery. I don't know. But I think that that would be a very interesting video to get out in the public. Now, can you tell us about the Indo-Pacific mention where ARV is mentioned, please? Yes, yes, yes. So talking about foreign reproduction vehicles, on U.S. government networks, there exists infrared footage of an imagery of a grouping of vessels engaged in SIGINT, Signals Intelligence, and MASSINT, which is Measurement and Measurement Intelligence. I believe so. Keep reading that. I know we looked this up. SIGINT and MASSINT collection at night in a specific area of the Pacific Ocean, not naming names. In this footage, which was in close proximity to the vessels, a large equilateral triangle UAP suddenly appears directly over the ships. The three bright points are seen at each bottom corner of the UAP, which is observed to slowly rotate on its horizontal axis. This rotation partially revealed a horizontal bar of sweeping lights. Intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral triangle is a reproduction vehicle and concludes that the vessels must have been made aware of the ARV's frequent use of these coordinates due to foreign pre-positioning of advanced collection assets at the exact time and place. After a brief period of hovering and slowly rotating approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean, the ARV suddenly disappears and the footage ends. Just ominous. Again, we've heard from individuals, Elizondo whistleblowers, that there are videos and images that exist on U.S. government networks, but a lot of these videos, especially in this case, this was taken in what we would call a denied area. This is a intelligence surveillance platform that we have in a foreign area that we're using to collect intelligence on our foreign adversaries and others. Releasing that publicly would be a little bit little bit controversial. First, we have the equilateral triangle UAP, but then also potentially we might be doxing another country's legacy program. This would be China in this instance, based on the relative proximity, which this is one of the greatest questions. China and Russia are our adversaries as discussed by some people like David Grush. How much success have they made in their legacy programs? Grush has said we're in a decades-long Cold War with our adversaries. Did they rip off a TRF 3B triangle? It's really, really interesting. I find it interesting that the term ARB slash RV is used too. It's not just Alien Reproduction Vehicle, but also Reproduction Vehicle. I'm happy that distinction was made because Reproduction Vehicle could just mean a reverse engineer to make jet or something. Forgive me for speculating here on the live stream, but what if Alien Reproduction Vehicle and Reproduction Vehicle kind of leaves out the possibility that we have Reproduction Vehicles that we wouldn't necessarily call Alien. In the sense of there's potentially objects that are coming extraterrestrially, which we would consider general or traditional aliens. Or is there stuff that's coming interdimensional or within our oceans or some coming in and out of our existence? We could call that Alien or we could call it something else. But at the end of the day, what we're trying to copy, it's a reproduction vehicle. I thought this instance was interesting as well due to just one sentence. So, Southcom tic-tac detected by space asset in proximity a vessel. On USG networks, there exists OPIR imagery of massent of a tic-tac UAP transmitting through an area of the Atlantic Ocean. The tic-tac maneuvers had an altitude at or near local cloud coverage and correlated electromagnetic signatures were collected by massent. In the available footage, the tic-tac UAP transits rapidly through the field of regard as it transits the ocean. No observation reaction is seen to come from the vessel, but its proximity in space and in time and space to the trajectory of this UAP suggests foreknowledge of the UAP event by intelligence. So, what's interesting to me that there is so Magnetic Constellation is just kind of accessing these intelligence databases to collect records and so forth. So, who is the intelligence organization behind shooting this video if they had forewarned knowledge of this UAP incursion event and thus were kind of predicting its movements? Would this be a satellite system? I don't think it's too far of a stretch to think some of these sightings may be conducted by NRO and NGA, gruscious positions who have satellite systems that actually can detect and track some of these vehicles. Yeah, and just knowing how just, I mean, I've never worked in government or military intelligence, but just briefly how that kind of works is, I think that they're trying to get multiple signatures of the same object. It's one thing just to get a satellite, but then also like ground sensor, camera, underwater sensor, a second kind of corroborative source to verify if this thing is existing, it's real. They're tracking it usually on more than one kind of instrument. And let's talk a little bit about the morphologies, right? So, we're using a data set from 1991 to 2002. I'd just like to talk about the morphologies just because it's so interesting. Within the irregular shapes, of course, the jelly fish are floating brains with appendages. Where we see that one is mentioned. Yeah, exactly. And there's also another mention in the report about, I think it's the Mexican border of a jellyfish, which I'll talk about too, but sphere or orb. So, of course, Aero had reported on this as well, including some old data and blue book and so forth. Spheres were the most reported shape with variations ranging from smooth, featureless orbs to spheres with visible openings or appendages. These objects prevalence suggests a possible standard in UAP design or function capable of high maneuverability and speed. The diversity within the sphere category spanning from simple polished appearances to more complex structures with appendages suggests a broad range of purposes or technologies unique to the platform's mission and or the originator. The mention of appendages on spheres instead of a ubiquitous smooth shape reminds me of the 2010 San Diego Sphere Siding. Have you heard of that? I don't think so now. It's a long video. It's about a 12 minute video of a sphere that has what you would describe as almost an antenna around the circumference. And so that is one really interesting sighting. Disk or saucer. Saucer shaped UAPs reported with and without domes. If you want to look that up, go to the It's Redacted YouTube channel. This was posted a couple years ago and maybe we can hold an image up to the screen. They have the full video. Saucer shaped UAPs reported with and without domes were the second most common shape reported. Flat saucers were reported as well. These being disks like objects without pronounced domes. Trilateral biconvex UAPs are also reported in the data. So I think in the Aero Historical Reporting Trends in 2022, the saucer shapes were not featured as one of the most common sightings. So I could be wrong there, but that is a, did you see it? No, I was just making a quick note for myself. Okay, let me pull it. I can pull it up. I'll pull it up. You, why don't you read us about oval and tic-tac and bring up some interesting stuff there, especially because I didn't Kirk Patrick imply that the tic-tac may have been human technology? Did Kirk Patrick say that? I don't know, maybe. Oval or tic-tac oval shaped UAPs were infrequently reported within the data set and only after approximately 2003, these UAPs either maintained a uniform egg-like symmetry occasionally tampered into a teardrop shape. So cylinders with convex ends, tic-tacs fall into this category and occasionally feature visible, visible protuberances on the top or bottom of the otherwise uniform plan. So that'd be like the flavor incident, right? With the almost kind of features on the bottom of the craft. So let me pull this up because this is a really, I think, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen that photo. So this is what I think of when I hear spear and some of the appendages. You guys may have, sorry, you may have heard of the sighting that's 2000. I can't remember the year San Diego Sphere. The YouTube channel is long been defunct, but it's fantastic. It's redacted, has a video on the entire, entire sighting. Will you read off the triangle description? Oh, absolutely. Interesting point I want to touch on there. So triangles were among the rarest UAPs reported in the data. Most of these sightings were equilateral triangles occasionally with vertical stabilizers visible on the top of the UAP. Along gated isosceles types were also reported, were also reported occasionally with the same vertical stabilizers observed on the equilateral type. So the vertical stabilizers is an interesting point. Conventional triangle designs such as the, you know, what you would call the TR3B does not feature this. If you look at some other simple, some other similar designs like the alleged TR3A Astra or so forth, or even that video Tom DeLonge likes to champion, it's that green UFO video at night. One thing I noticed about that triangle is it has stabilizers on top. So I've always tried to reference that because that sort of looks similar to like the X43 unmanned NASA craft and so forth. So that's a, that's a pretty darn interesting. Yeah. All right. What are you looking at now in the report? Sorry, we're kind of bouncing back and forth between the report, but you know, I thought it, I thought it was important for all of us to talk about it and anything that stood out to you guys just leave in the comments. Any questions, especially just let us know about the question. Yeah, I will say just like looking at these different types and just kind of thinking about, you know, the different reports that's kind of being summarized in here, right? Like spheres are, you know, the most common, but they're also kind of the smallest. And then triangles are the rarest, but they can be anywhere from an F16 to a size of a football field. Doesn't it say 600 feet as well? Or no, 600 feet is from other avenues of research. Never mind. Believes. Yeah. Like football field size. Yeah. Football field and 300 feet. So up to two football feats in length. I think the distinction between equilateral and isosceles triangle is important as well. As far as all research I've done into human made triangles, most of them seem equilaterally shaped. There's only a handful of cases dating back to the late 80s, early 90s and early 2000s of isosceles kind of shape triangles. Well, we also have not just triangles, but we also have boomerang arrowhead. Think of the Phoenix lights or think of the testimony of the man who testified at Stephen Greer's NPC, Stephen Digna, who talked about being at a bombing range. And before he left the service due to his health and Raytheon contractors basically facilitating a bomb, a boomerang shaped craft that was projecting something that came onto the range. That's an interesting testimony I'd like to revisit. Yeah. And then also just a lot of the atmospheric or kind of unique emissions and behavior seen by a lot of these as we see loss of time, visual disturbances, feelings of unease or anxiety, electronic device malfunction. And I think Kevin Knuth at Seoul last year gave the best examples of electromagnetic distortion and magnetic distortion. I highly recommend checking that out. I did watch that. That was really good. Very good. What about the organic shapes? Because I think that is probably one of the most interesting things for many people. Yep. Irregularly shaped UAPs, those that devise simple geometric description were among the rarest reported sightings. Shapeshifting UAPs also appear in the dataset, typically having a spherical or disc-like base form from which irregular geometries are seen to project. Floating brain or jellyfish UAPs are present as well, characterized by a central mass from which multiple arms or spars hang downward. Finally, combined shapes were also observed, including cubes within spheres, ringed saucers, and various rectangular and cuboid forms. The cuboid form, of course, that's interesting, calling back to Ryan Graves. Cube within a sphere is also one of those sightings as well. Specific mention of brain is very interesting to me specifically. The two don't really correlate, but I often think back to the physics concept of Boltzmann brain. The idea behind a Boltzmann brain from physicists can't remember his name Boltzmann, but it'd be far more efficient rather than an existing universe with matter for just a basically a combination of electric charged particles forming a brain, drifting through space, thinking of the material universe. I just think of that for the brain shape. Yeah, and something else just to point out that might be interesting is in terms of unique emissions, what we see with these irregular organics is that we see a temperature drop associated with these, and we don't really see that reported with the other morphologies, which is interesting. I'd be interested if there's any transmedial sighting or footage of these organic shapes, if there's also a temperature drop and temperature gradient as it may enter C or other domain, for variable temperatures. That'd be kind of interesting to see the heat signature and how it alters over the course of its flight. If perhaps when it moves faster, it heats up and so forth. Of course, we're not privy to any of this information, but we got our public report on our hands. Well, I think someone in the chat mentioned earlier, Oak Shannon. I think this is a very, very interesting kind of little tidbit in this document here. For section five, restricted US government historical records, there is a call out to a specific, it's a serial number that corresponds to an official NSA report published in 1978, which people have now confirmed was included, this specific citation was included in Oak Shannon's notes, which is very interesting. The specific notes, I'm trying to remember the actual event I've referenced it a few times. The specific event, it may have been at Los Alamos National Labs where Oak Shannon took notes from some detailed speakers. I referenced here when Oak Shannon relayed information he was told about an undersea base, a USO base. So he writes about that. He writes about connection to possible MHD propulsion physics with, I think, a 3.5 gigahertz range. Numerous interesting notes about programs. I think he mentions Bobby Ray Inman in that. That's just off the top of my head, but these notes are for a panel of speakers that I think was at Los Alamos in the late 80s. Yep. And then just to add about this report as well. The substance of the report concerns scientific research in the Soviet Union on the topics of parapsychology, Psi, and biological effects on UAPs on human beings. Additionally, the existence of this reporting stream demonstrates that US intelligence was explicitly tasked to collect on foreign entities active in areas often relegated to the fringes of scientific research, including parapsychology, and the biological effects of encounters with UAP. And this shouldn't be surprising, guys, even people who are uncomfortable with the idea of Psi like myself, it's pretty new to them. Let's think back to the NSWC crane project in which not only SAIC, but the Project Stargate, which was researching the Psi phenomena from SRI and the CIA. But even in 2011 and onward, the O&amp;R, the Office of Naval Research, published papers on human sixth sense and human psionic abilities, which is still extremely strange. This is why we need good smart guys like Max, who are really well researched into some of this this Psi connection. Absolutely. So let's go. I think we got some questions. We'll look through the chat with it. We'll look through here. So have you or anyone you know made any inroads to getting information around the energy source of these vehicles? Has anyone talked about plasma? Yes. I think Edgar Fouchet in the TR3B discusses superheated plasma along with mercury. Inroads, as far as the energy source, there's disagreements. I know really smart people who think that we haven't quite cracked zero point systems. I think to the story of Brad Sorensen, where zero point systems are applicable. I've heard from numerous people that electrogravity are a thing. Could you mind passing me a soda? Yeah, I got you. I think electrogravity are possibly a thing too. Of course, there's the story of MFD, MHD. So there's quite a bit of information around energy systems. Nothing concrete yet. I don't know if you have heard anything else. Sorry, I was just kind of going off topic there. Do you guys believe Grush will ever be allowed on a skiff? They've now had nearly 18 months to hide everything. That is a good point, right? If locations are violated, then there's not immediate actionable intelligence follow-ups that these locations will likely be cleared or further obfuscations created. If I remember, Grush did not get in a skiff with Verchette? I don't think he got in a skiff with them at all. Okay, yeah. I know that Burleson has at least been privy to the op-ed by Grush. I have these conversations occurred outside of Skiff, I'm not sure, but to me, it's pretty unacceptable. Okay, yeah. We talked about this a little bit, but do you think Boebert's comments were purposeful in order to harm public perception on this topic? Judi, by the way, she talked. I just think she probably carries a bit of the stigma, because I'd like to mention, guys, before the hearings even started, the cameraman, when people were filing in and looked at me and said, oh, this is going to go on Ancient Aliens, right? What am I going to say to that? No, this is a serious congressional hearing. Right outside, I had to run out, use the restroom before we started. I hear a bunch of staffers or congressmen talking, this is what happens when you leave YouTube autoplay on for too long. If you're finding my channel off autoplay, first of all, thanks for being here. But second of all, I mean, that's so foolish. And that's the sort of mind and stigma that has been manufactured. And it's understandable if you have felt that and experienced that, because that is very well orchestrated by the CIA all the way back since 52. But many people fall victim to this. Yeah. I mean, it's one thing just to make jokes and just being coy about it and just being like, oh, yeah, Ancient Aliens, whatever. It's funny to joke about. But I did notice that there were quite a few people that they talk about it as if this is... There isn't really anything there there. And it's still kind of a conspiracy. And who are these people and what are these programs? She treats it the same as maybe like chemtrails or other popular conspiracies like birds. But also from her perspective, she's kind of been like one of the conspiracy theorists in Congress. That's kind of her reputation, if you will. So, hey, I mean, roll with what you know. But I don't think her comments were super helpful or really appreciated by people in the UFO world that wanted sober conversation about this. And I think a lot of the people that are going to affect change when we have Congress people like this are going to be their staffers. There's a world of staffers that take this very seriously who want to learn. And they want to affect change and they want to have the information to brief. Not brief, that might be a poor word, but to inform the person they work for and so forth. So, Magic says, have you seen Sheehan making the rounds lately? What are your thoughts on everything he is saying? Seems worlds apart from just getting into the public site, guys. Well, we had lunch yesterday right by Sheehan in this crazy, crazy gray hair. And he also had like a disclosure event outside of the park right after. There was a rally outside like a block away from the Rayburn building where the hearing happened. And he spoke and then a couple other individuals spoke as well. Yeah. I think for the amount of information Sheehan puts out, he needs to start supplying adequate research, go along it, alongside of it or evidence or other people to confirm these statements. Danny Sheehan, of course, has been very consequential as a really interesting person, but before he continues to put forward new information, he kind of needs to figure out ways to back up his things he said previously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what I will say about that with Sheehan is I think he's not a stranger to kind of fighting the government as well. And I think part of it is he has kind of a role to play as kind of the legal person that's helping facilitate stuff behind the scenes with certain players. But also as we see kind of with this new Paradigm Institute, I think, you know, there's kind of a public perception or kind of awareness intention there of just trying to get that organization set up. So I think that's kind of why we're seeing this like interesting stuff with Sheehan, because traditionally, you know, he's like, he's a lawyer, he's an attorney, he's kind of working on the investigative space, but then also seeing him with like the new Paradigm Institute and that stuff as well, it's like, okay, how do you reconcile that? Selling degrees. Yeah. Yeah. For tens of thousands of dollars. Jimmy says, I have friends who believe it's almost definitely Chinese or Russian tech, especially Chinese. What, if any, gives you the confirmation this is fact alien slash NHI? Well, I think quite a few factors. One of them is the persistent existence of this phenomenon for more than 80 years. In fact, you can even go into other stories in history, but even dating back to the Magenta Crash in 1933, there are similarities in this phenomenon in terms of crash shape, in terms of performance characteristics of craft. I mean, you had Nazi scientists, Herman Oberth, studying flying saucer flight dynamics, estimating tens if not hundreds of thousands miles per hour, these things would be flown. You can also look at the G-forces experienced by some of these craft. It's not a ballistic missile that can handle 120 Gs. It's not a human being that can sustain nine Gs before seeing permanent injury. I know Lou talked about this during the hearing or was it UAPBF? We talked about G-forces experienced by the craft. Was that the hearing? That was at the hearing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So Lou kind of lobald that a little bit. If you look at the work by Kevin Knuth and estimating flight characteristics of unidentified aerial phenomenon, which is a great paper, I highly recommend everybody read this. It analyzes the performance characteristics of not just the 2004 Nimitz, but also the 1986 Japan Airlines case and other such cases. G-forces of this, these craft can be experienced of up to 5,000 Gs. That's very different. There's also numerous reports from under fast walkers that NORAD and NASA and the DSP defense support program would call these craft back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s that had a term for craft that were entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere. These would not show classical characteristics of fuel burning rockets and traditional prosaic technologies. These things would sometimes arrive from deep space or return to deep space. I don't know, especially in the 60s and 70s of Chinese tech, that's playing into do that. Yeah. Again, we're also talking about sightings that have been seen even before modern weapons as well. How far do we really want to go with this? I would say there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there was a phenomenon that existed well before the Second World War and the creation of the world superpowers, all that stuff. You can try to figure out whether or not that's alien non-human. I personally think that that seems to be the conclusion just based off of those historical reports. I know there's a lot of researchers that look at that pre-modern history of UFO sightings. Which is very valid. I think your friend is right about the idea that some of these craft might be ARB of Chinese or Russian origin. Just like many of the ARB are of United States origin. Some of our allies possibly also have their own technology as well. I just think that many of the craft, especially when you start looking at craft characteristics and differences in reported craft that are considered ARB versus non-human craft, just the difference in the craft makeup. Non-human craft often described as perfect, rivetless, seamless, no visible means of propulsion, somehow able to create, go faster than the speed of sound and decelerate quickly without any sonic booms, without with very minimal or no electromagnetic signatures or signatures of any kind. The performance characteristics of these craft are not prosaic even to when people say oh well you know military is 20 years ahead, there's you know ballistic missiles 20 years from now are not surviving 5,000 geese of force dropping from 15,000 feet to sea level in less than two seconds. Okay got anything about my question on getting remote viewing under mainstream science scrutiny? Are there any efforts there from me? Yes, yes, yes, I see. Yes, and talking to Chris from Area 52, I would really like to maybe see if we can put on some public displays of remote viewing to maybe you know introduce the the channel to whether the efficacy or or not not if there's nothing there. I would absolutely like to do that because this would be something we'd all be learning together. Well they had a lot of those studies in the late 80s and 90s and at least according to the government there was no there wasn't really a basis to continue funding of it but then ultimately that whole program got transferred over to SAIC in 1995. So do you believe the blue book classified version of his story where he says he saw the images this is um this is Danny Sheehan. Yes after yeah I would say after like I think there's been some records that have come out of the era like out of this like whole declassification process and particularly the Air Force Blue Book documents. The symbols that he that Sheehan has like drawn out or whatever um like. This was put in NARA recently right the National Archives. Yep yep so like he like the depiction I think the depiction that he gave of those symbols is like dead accurate of the symbols that are in these blue book files. Yeah I'd also like to reference it is a fact that there were programs working alongside blue book that were not unacknowledged but not referenced this would be project Stork out of Patel and then you can also adhere to the testimony of other whistleblowers such as Steven Lufkin who said that he was privy to a program more classified than blue book a more classified blue book basically where he was shown some of the Roswell degree and so yes I think that is a really good really good question. Question how do you guys picture disclosure personally I think Richette's whistleblower type protections won't pass but if it does I think there has to be someone walking out of Lockheed etc. If there are pension protections I think that could be possible that's what I have to say. Yep I think that specific language of it is they're going to give whistleblower protections to any whistleblower that has knowledge of basically taxpayer funds that are being used so I think the first inquiry right is like government funds taxpayer money that's being spent on this and I think that that's good I hope that those protections pass um but then I think the second part right and this is it goes back to kind of the theory of like how does this get funded well if the government's not writing a black check to Lockheed Martin are they taking money from investors potentially and then like how aware of those investors in those types of programs and that's a question that's really kind of the messier legal questions that open up from that questions like that you have been talking about and thinking about quite a bit the last couple of days I've talked with a lot of people about it it's very interesting okay Eric says uh any comments on how put off you brought Lew into the program and many others he met with H teller and worked on graph control best candidate for involvement in legacy program I am oh I am really eagerly awaiting his appearance in the program he needs to get subpoena yeah he needs to get subpoena too but I think he'd be uh I think he'd be a agreeable witness because there's hostile witnesses there's non agreeable witnesses and there's agreeable witnesses he should be encouraged to attend the hearing and a closed yeah senate section okay lou said this okay you're talking about lou in the cold war same as grush um do you believe that UAP are alive as Luna said a theory I've seen in the genre for a while well as we talked about in the immaculate constellation report the idea of biological crap would then um would then kind of encourage that I think it's quite possible you know we talk about this all the time I don't think UAP and non-human intelligence is mutually exclusive or is is really siloed if there's one non-human intelligence here it opens the door for numerous types of non-human intelligence all with different capabilities and um basically propulsion systems and methods of travel and methods of communication and methods of detailing their presence are all quite possible yeah I will say the movie nope Jordan Peele great movie scary but I can definitely see that happening after the specific mention of brain in the uh IC report it's it's very very very startling to me okay oh okay this is a good one for us max can you speculate on the origin of the sphere that was located underneath NSWC for anybody that doesn't know um the program Kermit and I worked on together was um the off-world technologies division yep experienced by Green Beret 18 Bravo weapon sergeant RA uh witness RA who in the early 2010s was sent to RA for an advanced weapons trading course and here he and one other person because of their high clearance levels and because of some of their accomplishments level five of sphere um you know deployments and so forth were basically taken underground by a contractor seen some interesting Russian ballistics and some interesting weaponry as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant you have to do proficient with all forms of small arms fire and then they're brought into a place deep underground um the air was described as very damp stale cold by RA into an off-world technologies division here the contractor who we both highly suspect as SAIC show two pieces of technology one and almost tablet device that seemed to be projecting writing uh RA did not know if this was in his head or actually physically like a holographic projection of writing and this piece was said to have been recovered uh during being recovered and was considered a weapon due to an electric or an energetic discharge during recovery the other piece was a sphere about the size of a baseball with a small indent at the top this was described as metallic but very smooth and almost shimmering like oil on water RA was told that this specific piece of technology somehow interacted with consciousness as far as the origins of this I've talked to max the person asking the question and Kermit here about another individual Navy connect Navy connected who likely interacted with the same technology a couple decades prior so if that's the case the Navy might have had an active program uh with this piece for weird kind of the size stuff we were talking about the origins if it's housed alongside that gauntlet tablet type thing that is considered weapons technology one has to assume that this was also a piece of technology recovered from a crash retrieval absolutely and I also think just the nature of the crash retrievals themselves and we kind of see this in other reports here and there is as these things are taken in right as we're retrieving these craft were then trying to you know piece off these different areas of like okay Lockheed figure out how the craft work SAIC figure out how this orb works right north figure out how this engine works right and just trying to piece these different areas and giving these technologies transferred over to private industry to try to see if they can figure out how this shit works you know I at least don't know the origin but I can with confidence say that this was taken off of a crash retrieval where when are there multiple no idea absolutely no idea the witness I've spoken to that encountered this was on the other side of the country the California to be exact so was this program shelved that the Navy used with this and then this is just housed for further analysis and I would like to harken back to Harold Malmgren who spoke about being briefed in the 1960s about an other world technologies division yep very close yep do you guys feel like any of these quote-unquote UFOs can be top secret government weapons absolutely alien reproduction vehicle absolutely absolutely it's just I mean UFO is an unidentified flying object you see like an experimental aircraft you don't know what the hell it is you're going to think it's a UFO right but it could just be something like a you know new drone or you know the new self-claim whatever so yeah what do you say we'll go for 10 more minutes answering questions yeah all right guys we'll keep going for some questions for a few more minutes and then we'll uh okay we answered that about how put off Eric sorry if we're getting to the question slow guys I just think you know I'm glad Kermit feels the same way everyone's taking their time to ask questions so really appreciate it y'all yeah and these are I told you Kermit everybody ask the best questions here okay with the admission that yes USG has a crash retrieval in reverse engineering program for UAP this validates claims of Herrera and Weigand is there a lawsuit in the works reparations I think their cases are you know far more kind of uh I guess Michael's case doesn't relegate to that as much because remember Michael's case talks about seeing an alien reproduction vehicle this specifically octagonal shaped I'm still trying to track down the manufacturer for that Greer thinks it's locky but has proposed no evidence but Weigand his story is one of those more classic crash retrievals and with some of the comments in the IC report about you know psychological effects and then the probability that was a DOE nest team you know you kind of have to analyze that with a more credible with a different lens and you do with Michael now with the testimony of ARV I just am waiting to see a dang report of a octagonal ARV please yeah okay let me okay okay talking about the oak shane and serial numbers what do you think it will take for mainstream scientific analysis to start looking into remote viewing and either confirm or debunk it for good that's a good question I and I have to assume academia approaching UAP and how they approach UAP is likely the same approach they take to promote viewing I cannot think of a reason why the subject should not be studied seriously especially when the Navy studies yeah this might seem like a very random call out but I'm I'm now remembering there's a 60 minutes documentary that happened that looked at basically there's a scientific study that was done where they were trying to prove precognition where individuals were like shown as a set of numbers or something and they basically had to predict what the next number and the sequence was going to be like before they even saw it and what they determined from that is that it seemed that there was some type of correlation between you know we what we call a sixth sense or something that's like you know exists in our mind but there was there was a very real trend where like these individuals could like use this precognitive ability so I feel like stuff like that and just kind of getting those types of reports and just getting the awareness out and then you know trying to come up with ways kind of similar to that study I know it's kind of like weirdly specific and it's just off the dome but I think things like that will kind of help us try to figure that out it's strange to me that kind of the fallback is oh the CIA did a study in the 80s and their Stargate and nothing came from it yeah it's not a reason not to study the subject no okay thoughts on the skinny bob video I think I get to ask this every time I have I have no thoughts about it I I have never once studied it at least from a first glance it looks to be a little a little too smooth for for realness what do you say Kermit but I have not studied it at all yeah I I don't I don't um I don't have an opinion on any videos that claim to depict biologics or non-human intelligence so question and of course like you know if the politics are pertinent to UAP of course we'll talk about it not to be political but don't you worry that people like bobert and trump might lessen the credibility of the top rick half the country doesn't take him seriously that that is something I think we talked about that if trump really pushed disclosure would that kind of be used as a talking point to discredit disclosure because so many people find trump in the kind of poor taste it raises a good question uh bobert as well as we kind of saw with the the hearing um wrong attitude in my opinion yeah I will say I had an interesting conversation with some staffers on the democrat side they kind of brought up the same point too of just like hey you know particularly in the hearing yesterday a lot of the representatives in that were republican and I think as we think about the next four years and trumping president and all those new cabinet positions and whatnot um you know I think we'll we'll start to see some more answers but again I think to your point right when bobert and trump talk about this I think people particularly on the other side kind of see it a certain way and they'll just kind of check out and be like oh trump's a crazy person and this just confirms my own opinion um I do think he could be a good asset it's just it's really coming down to the communication it's tough to navigate now just with so much distrust in any administration really yeah yeah so you know we'll see it it's a great question and if it's yeah go ahead we should talk about trump's uncle because uh that's something that I love to bring up when people get political about this so donald trump's uncle was john trump who was a mit professor who was he worked for the radiation laboratory at lincoln lab and he was like one of the early founders of radar and in 1943 when tesla died john trump was called in by the united states to basically document all of tesla's patents and make sure that none of them were dangerous so I don't want to get too speculative I don't want to say that john trump was part of legacy program but of all the people with all the relevant experience I think his uncle would have been someone that would have known something that's a great point so so what is uh kms what is your opinion on gold's testimony if you consider begging for money a testimony I think it's disappointing he was not asked about material transfer between all sap uh bigelow aerospace and lock emart yeah I agree I it honestly it's like that was that's what I was expecting and ultimately it's like maybe you know maybe gold wasn't really involved with that and maybe you know they had conversations prior and they're like I can't really talk about it because I just don't really know anything but the fact they didn't even ask the question to begin with just like the public can know about that because like we the public were aware of all sap we're aware of bigelow and all this stuff why didn't you ask the question at all yeah that was weird the smell test gold was a really nice well-to-do meaning guy but nasa has been caught lying about UFOs before so then be the most transparent agency he's ever worked for you know I I'd uh I'd have to agree with that so so Juan again thank you sir even the hoc are aware aware carl nel is uh first hand yeah an army futures command and deputy cto of north of bromance that's a guy who should have testified yep yep what uh what do you make of the idea that nh i may be a component of preventing disclosure I wouldn't be surprised but I I don't have too much of a thesis there I do like to think back to David grush talking about agreements with uh with nh i yeah and if there's I mean if there's positive and negative nh i and you know we can't really figure out what they want to do here it wouldn't be hard to assume that there's nh i that don't really agree with yeah right from an outside perspective it's always really difficult for me to attribute uh human motivation to non-human intelligence yeah are we okay are we heading towards what Reagan spoke of or humanity unites to fight an outside force listen I think Reagan put plenty of defenses uh plenty of money into those defenses under the sdi star wars program we had some really good stuff and yeah I think there's a lot of funds that were given to other programs and used for for uap stuff yeah but I think kind of coming back to the threat narrative here I think there's there's been some discussion around that a little bit it just like you know what these things are and how this is going to be presented to the public I know Reagan's comments were really about like you know what happens if an alien threat gets revealed and then like the public you know the world would just unite all around together yeah I don't really feel like this this is going to happen with this situation I think that I think disclosure the way it's playing out is is being done in a way that like ensures like national sovereignty instead of like you know this being like oh shit they're showing up and we have five years to prepare a type thing like something like from a movie um so yeah it it's kind of interesting but I don't I don't think it's going to be like this big international like new world order yeah you know I think really it's just people trying to get to the bottom of it and a lot of people I think use that to push the um star or blue beam blue beam theory oh yeah blue beam okay question from truth sauce the video you did about mark mcandellish was awesome thank you sir any further discussions on uh with the living friend that threatened you yes and he threatened me again and I found other people who he's threatened as well so maybe he needs to be summoned as a hostile witness maybe he needs to be summoned okay awakening to reality what's up man jonathan thank you for joining looking for the uh looking for the cues okay yes match part just talked about this remember all four of technologies is mentioned by herald malmgren in relation to richard the cell I think he specifically said other world technologies but still and he was uh the cell was cia director as well yep yep okay okay so long ago when we got claims that people from greerstein the pentagon and co have been opting funds illegally and estimated two trillion were unaccounted for how can congress get accounts and tell them about you trying to talk to kathryn austin fits yeah so I mean I reached out to kathryn a handful of times uh when I was writing my like recent report on the legal financial framework a lot of the stuff that I kind of pulled and talked about really comes from her salari missing money dot com website uh very I mean just treasure trove of information about financial covert operations and stuff like that highly encourage y'all to check that out if you're interested in that um but now no response from her unfortunately but this estimated two trillion dollars unaccounted for that still exists um because a lot of people are really aware of this but the department of defense is now being required to basically go through full independent audits of itself which it's never really had to do that in its history before up until actually 2017 interesting date um so and what's interesting is just in the past six and seven years of pentagon audits if you look at just the money and just kind of the remediations that they've made it is it is a black hole that is trillions of dollars worth and it's not going away and fits all not gone away fits said it's not just do d but housing and urban development it's a lot of other agencies yep it was she I think from her account she saw cumulative four trillion dollars move from department of defense and department of uh housing and urban hud sorry hud and do d four trillion cumulative in that one year that she was so this is just an interesting thing while we scroll down get to the rest of the questions none of these guys were whistleblowers um yeah I agree with that in the sense that we talked about earlier that uh we're both familiar with accounts where people who are planning to testify have been threatened up to the day of not to and uncertain congressman being a little bit surprised or expecting kind of mercy or more firsthand people to uh to uh go for okay hey here's one especially for you kermit have you guys come across the work of trevor james constable he talked about sky creatures back in 77 and says the movie nope has similarities to his work I personally haven't but I I'd love to kind of check that out now I also found the movie pretty interesting I'm gonna have to put that in my notes so thank you for the reference thank you pun shrink I appreciate I appreciate that a lot for james constable okay sorry we'll look through more questions um hey thank you john s you rock as well sky creatures so cool uh let's see okay okay let's see uh so yeah michael made those kind of claims and I I still don't know if there's any veracity to them um and so forth so weighing boss uh thank you so much for the five bucks why were no ad runs or ads run against uap caucus members deliberately so is the topic that obscure I think the topic is that obscure like is this is this saying like during their like when they were seeking election maybe for uap caucus maybe maybe in the sense of like why are there no inflammatory posts against guys like lester or uh some of the guys really trying to talk to staffers and so forth okay got you um I think it's just obscure yeah I will say like the the congressional hearings were very well attended but I will say you could probably guess who a majority of the people were there just based off of who talks a lot on twitter and reddit but yeah anybody asking about brad brad has given me nothing but yep like yelling at me and all caps are giving me death threats so leslie gain thought it was disturbing but also had a laugh with me about it so if you can divulge who are the most interesting people you connected with at dc it's been a good way to meet movers and shakers the most interesting person not at liberty to kind of uh talk about that but some of the interesting people uh talking with lou talking with gallaudet every second okay I made a list of people I talked to so let me go through okay so lester nair jesse michael's chris from area 52 amar from yes theory tim gallaudet jeremy corbell michael gold lou elezano james foch merrick von reinenkamp timber chet eric burleson nancy mace danie sheehan michael schellenberger missleman jack awesome twitter account matt ford matthew pines leslie cane um and probably a couple more and I got to talk to all these people yeah right the conversations it we had like a 15 hour day yesterday yeah it was like I mean started at 7am and then we got back to the hotel at like 10 we were so pooped we were walking back from the place in which uapdf was held back to our hotel and I think both of us were just kind of having like a a really surreal experience absolutely I mean yesterday was oh probably one of the most consequential days I've ever had and true honor I mean we're just we're just two two guys and we get to uh I'm really proud of the community for kind of stop uh not being so much of a closed door community and I'm seeing a lot of people Democrats Republicans uh smart lawyers like Ivan a lot of these people kind of communicating and talking yeah it's a lot of people working together and it's it's it's very humbling to see it and it's it's very exciting because it's it's a lot of people that have good motivations and they're inquisitive and they just want the truth you know and it's everyone's on the same team um so oh what if we're what if we're a science experiment or perhaps our existence hinges on us not knowing we're an experiment maybe that's why they don't want to disclose that's quite possible I mean there are reports even outside of Bob Lazar of the human genome being tampered with or humans being and I don't want to count in Zachariah's Sitchin and the the Sumerians because I think there's uh some problems with those translations but it's a very valid theory yeah I mean Lude talks about in his book he equates humanity to the 800 pound gorilla in the exhibit right when we steal the tranquilizer gun and then what happens when we uh knock on the zookeeper's door good question Viagra 500 milligrams I get a chance to watch NAPS new documentary we had an awkward episode with Michael um no I I have not seen that yet I that's investigating alien and I will watch it at some point I just I haven't seen anything besides the trailer uh is that what's this new Dan Farah docus that's being overhyped I don't know I don't know the do you know anything about the documentary because I've been asked like multiple times is this person that you talk to in the documentary I'm mostly no what is the documentary yeah I I don't know too much about it I know it's been kind of talked about in tandem with Fox's production the program um to my knowledge this Farah films doc is going to feature like 30 different high level witnesses um 30 30 and the mostly government military I hope so but I find that I find that tough to however I don't think there's been any communications about if that documentary has finished what the state of it is and whether or not it's going to be published I think people I think the rumor was it was supposed to be published before the election and then it was after the election and then like even still it's just it there's no date on the calendar yet for it but it it exists it's real and the people that are in the film uh that we got to shake hands with they talked about it with us they're like yes this is like the Farah film I was in this whatever um and I think I think even um Michael gold even Michael during the hearing is like I'm going to talk about it in this uh this documentary that's coming I'm like okay cool like we need to see that now so who is Dan Farah that's a good question because I like a documentary I have no idea I look this up thoughts on project gravitar the new models are doc so I got to talk at length to Chris from area 52 who just got on Luigi from project gravitar Chris got me really excited um did did you talk to him at all about gravitar um I no and I told him straight up the reason I don't really talk about Bob Lazarus because I'm so biased towards Bob that it's difficult for me to talk about it but he he got me hyped what do you see about Dan uh Dan's a documentary filmmaker but he also produced movies uh notably ready player one which was okay movie that aired in theaters 2018 that was one of the movies of all time yeah so as uh I've heard that another hearing is happening on the 18th or whatever the next hearing is may you do I think this is more a Senate hearing on arrows specifically so don't get your hopes up about that that's going to be probably pretty dry it will be interesting to see how Kosolowski discusses kind of the the arrows kind of operations you can comparing that back to how Kirk Patrick's made those statements will answer five more and then and then we'll wrap up truth so I hated the comment about some guy in a Winnebago the same thing happening now happens in the 40s 50s including the 52 flap uh who said who said that I that was uh that was the comment about like the credibility of the witnesses like you guys aren't all just bunch of people living in a Winnebago that was that was the comment oh to make fun of people going like to see craft outside of area 51 all the guys would get into something like something like that maybe I thought it was in the context of like they were at like one of the representatives asked Elizondo like what his um what his career kind of wasn't like what his experience was and it was like the point of like okay you're not just like some crackpot in Winnebago okay well yeah needs to stop getting names thrown around like crackpot ancient aliens or youtube being left on the stick but just needs to stop yeah like Jimmy says thoughts on the document from Sarbakar on Oppenheimer von Neumann being involved with crash retrievals I've covered Sarbakar very often and I think he's an extremely credible individual you're pretty familiar with Sarbakar too right ish okay yeah I I would I put a lot of I yeah but I am not surprised there especially because he's mentioned him at other times as well uh let's see truth sauce did that bother you shouldn't these congress people be more well informed for the same nuclear base incursions okay I understand your your comment now in this context yes of course that bothers me I hate the name calling the throwing around there's rude snide comments I hear outside and it's just what we do it Kermit just talked about the byproduct of the stigma being so darn successful yeah uh okay let's uh let's go through uh see awakening see a man Winnebago catching strays uh okay we'll do this one and then one more question if one pops up while we're talking what are your thoughts on abductions uh this is still a difficult question I love the work of John Mack uh it's difficult for me to connect abductions to what I'd say my bread and butter is which is crash retrieval reverse engineering and witness testimony analysis so uh the abductions are fascinating then there's a lot of witnesses under a career that talk about human abductions for my lab purposes and so forth one witness in specific 10 8 9 2 and his witness log uh I need to do more due diligence and read more of John Mack's book because I'm not closed off to the idea I'm just ill informed yeah I'm kind of in the same boat I mean again my my bread and butter is the excel file that is the classified balance sheet and trying to see that um but in terms of abductions like my thoughts of it is like you know kind of backed with Mack is like Mack's kind of uh thesis of it is like you know these people are you know genuine they have these experiences and they're telling like an accurate genuine account of their experience now is that something that's happening physically like are they being physically taking from the space and put into a spaceship or is this happening like within their mind of like they're having this like experience within consciousness so they don't really understand but in their brain they think it's like an abduction event you know it could be something like both but what I will say is I'm kind of a you know I come from a Catholic background so I do fundamentally believe in things like you know possession demonic possession things like that and I think that there is a little bit of tie-in between those two things I wouldn't be surprised okay we got uh three two more and we'll go through it or truth sauce three more we talked about we talked about the new netflix series I haven't seen it have you seen uh investigation alien no but I'm watching it this weekend okay perfect perfect uh damply dude says do you think uh do you think about UFOs and aliens make them aware of you I think it's quite possible in any scenario the longer you stare into the void the more it stares back that's one of the best realms of cosmic horror so I think it's it's uh quite possible I've been told by some uh close friends you know not necessarily experiencers but just like the the hitchhiker effect it will now be in play once you get yeah closer but we have unfortunately we have not seen an orb in the hotel room no no yeah I would like to see an orb in the hotel room that's kind of my that's kind of my thoughts on that but yeah I've had nothing weird besides death threats to be honest troll mama thank you so much I really appreciate you thank you very much uh thank you so much last question we'll get to or I guess more of a comment and I will see if we have one more if UFOs are real we find out craze are real the boom abductions are real simple as that I can't argue with it um shows the TR3b while you're at it too all right please all right guys with that we'll wrap up tonight uh I hope everybody enjoyed having Kermit on I'd certainly love to have him on more so show some love and uh in the comments if you guys want to see him again and um you know if there's more hearings like she hand said coming up we will be there and I'll get this dude in the the media room with me but thank you guys so much for joining and uh expect the new video within the next week and then Kermit and I will be covering the soul show so thanks

This private non-profit has a prolific list of USG-contracted work, including classified SAPs. Battelle has a storied history in the technological development of our US society, including research into the fabrication of uranium for the Manhattan Project from 39 to 52, development of the photocopy machine and UPC barcode system, work on combustion, electronics, energy, conversion, propellants, all for Apollo 11, and military research into biological and chemical weapons slash defense systems and more. Today, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, as well as Oak Ridge National Lab, all of which are DOE-sponsored labs. So we already see some ties here with Battelle and the USG UAP work in Los Alamos and the DOE. But what if I told you, Battelle is harboring a dark secret, that the company has a long history of studying UFOs, aiding the USG and USAF in the UFO cover-up, and has even conducted analysis on UFO material. Hey guys, it is UAP Gerb and we are finally going to start to dive into one of the most fascinating aspects of the UFO phenomena, the private sector's connection to the study of UFOs. Numerous key figures such as David Grush, Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Eric Davis, former Senator Harry Reid, and more have made direct statements that USG defense contractors have a direct hand in the reverse engineering and crash retrieval of UAP. So today we are going to dive into one such company with real dirty hands on work of UFO material and research, the Battelle Memorial Institute. The earliest tracing of Battelle and UFOs goes to something called Project Stork. In 1952, the director of the Central Intelligence received a memorandum titled Flying Saucers, which detailed an arrangement between ATIC, the Air Force Technology Intelligence Committee, and Battelle Memorial Institute for the contractor to establish a machine indexing system for official reports of UFO sightings. On the 9th of January, 1953, Battelle's Dr. Howard C. Cross proposes that the ongoing Project Stork, quote, assists the Air Force in reassuring the public that everything is well under control with respect to the UFO problem. At the time, this memo was classified secret and even calls to attention Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the project's sign, grudge, and bluebook director. I've talked about him in the history of the stigma, so check that video out if you haven't. If you'll remember from that same video, in 1953, the Robertson Panel was conducted to ensure that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status and suggest the public there is no legitimate evidence of their existence. While the Robertson Panel was conducted, Battelle had been commissioned around the same time to separately analyze all Air Force UFO cases away from bluebook or these official panels under codename STORK. This project paralleled to bluebook and was even mentioned by J. Allen Heineck during his attempted testimony at the Robertson Panel. Thanks to the efforts of SUFON, the computer UFO network, I have been able to find all seven Project STORK status reports. That is another analysis for another day, however, all parts of course will be provided in the video description. On the 5th of May, 1955, Battelle and ATIC published a comprehensive analysis of 3,200 UFO sightings titled Special Report 14. This report concluded that UFO are not aerial aircraft beyond human scientific knowledge because no physical matter had ever been recorded from any UFO sighting. But if we dig deeper, there is a massive contradiction here from Battelle's claim that no physical matter had ever been recovered. Six years earlier in 1949, Battelle had been contracted by none other than Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to perform analysis on shape memory alloys. See on screen now and in the video notes the first and second progress report covering the period of September 1st to October 21st, 1949 on research and development of titanium alloys. The bulk of these investigations focus on Nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy, a metal that would not be officially discovered until 1961 by Dr. William J. Bueller. So Battelle was performing analysis on the nickel-titanium shape metal alloy, now known as Nitinol, over 10 years prior to its official discovery? Well what exactly is Nitinol? For you material scientists out there and I am not one of you, Nitinol has the unique properties of super-elasticity and shape memory. The metal can be subjected to high levels of stress and snap back to its original shape when pressure is released, showing no deformation on the material. Nitinol is also elastochloric where the material heats up when exposed to a mechanical force field. When this heat is released into the environment and the force field is removed, the material super cools and extracts the same amount of heat from the environment again. If I am not stressing this enough, Nitinol is a remarkable material that is exceedingly difficult to manufacture due to the exceptionally high and tight compositional control required and the tremendous reactivity of titanium. The material is even used for thermal and electrical actuators, implants due to the material's biocompatibility and structural dampening. So again, Battelle was contracted to perform a material analysis on an alloy that is exceedingly difficult to make, requiring vacuum arc remelting or vacuum induction remelting to manufacture today in the 21st century, but had this material in the late 40s specifically 1949? And does this alloy not sound almost exactly like the material that was discovered in the 1947 Roswell crash, that Jesse Marcell described as an exceedingly light metal that would retain its shape after deformation? And remember, Jesse Marcell was a military officer who was taken to the UFO crash debris field with rancher Mac Brazel, who discovered these materials and then was later told by General Rami to pose with balsa wood and aluminum foil to push the weather balloon theory and all of this is in Marcell's own words. More damming is that this debris from a UFO was supposedly shipped to none other than, you guessed it, Wright Patterson Air Force Base. So to summarize, I am directly inferring that the 1947 Roswell crash led to the discovery of the material known as Nitinol and thus Wright Patterson Air Force Base and the US Air Force contracted Battel to perform a material analysis on Nitinol in 1949 over 10 years before its quote unquote official discovery in the private sector. But this wouldn't be a UAP Grr video without the mention of the Atomic Energy Commission, would it not? Well this study by Battel into titanium base alloys was a research and development project under the Atomic Energy Commission. For those of you who have never watched one of my videos, UFO records and materials have been classically misclassified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement under Trans-classified Nuclear Foreign Material. With this report, Battel's work on titanium alloys is one of very few studies without classification. It's not labeled as classified, unclassified, or declassified, but rather is labeled as restricted. Essentially, this is a private sector classification standard in which only need to know read-in access is solely allowed. If you've never heard of this before, people like David Grush have spoken that part of the reason that private industries are used for UFO studies is because they have their own legal classification standards that can't be breached by people with SAP access like Grush himself. But even more perplexing, these studies into Nitinol were not declassified until 2010, but we can go deeper because I have the most bizarre connection to make with Battel and this Nitinol UFO material. Within Battel Report 2, we observe an inconspicuous subsection titled, quote, Analytical Methods for Titanium-Based Alloys by Juan A.C. Eckert and E.J. Center, a senior research chemical engineer who worked for Battel from 1939 to 1957. Looking out of the ordinary, right? Center's section of the report deals with titanium purity. Exceptionally pure titanium is needed to make Nitinol memory metal due to the high reactivity as titanium, as I mentioned above. So keep E.J. Center's name in mind, because let's travel to the summer of 1994 and read into the Ohio UFO notebook by Dr. Irene Scott and the MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network Board of Directors. This piece titled, quote, The Ohio UFO Crash Connection and Other Stories, details an informant who came to MUFON in 1992. This man attended North High School in Columbus, Ohio in the late 1950s. In 1958, he dated a girl named Kathy Center. One night while visiting her home, her father, one Elroy John Center, told them while working at Battel, and remember he left in 1957, he was, quote, responsible for a project which required him to study parts retrieved from a flying saucer. This section of E.J. Center is under one decoding the I-beam of the MUFON report. Roswell enthusiasts will know that Major Jesse Marcell, who was taken by Rancher Mack Braswell to the debris field, found an I-beam amongst the wreckage and memory metal, which had strange characters on it resembling hieroglyphs. What's crucial to remember here, guys, is that although MUFON reports on E.J. Center and his work on flying saucers for Battel in 1994, E.J. Center's 1949 work on Knittenall was not declassified until 2010. So making this connection unless E.J. Center was really, in fact, working on materials from a crashed disc for Battel, likely the Roswell wreckage, and blabbed about it once he left Battel in 1958, would be impossible. To put the cherry on top here, you JRE fans will remember famed computer scientist and ufologist Jacques Vall\u00e9e, appearing on JRE, the Joe Rogan podcast, on the 4th of December 2020, with the Phenomenon director James Fox. If you haven't seen the Phenomenon by Fox, I highly recommend checking this out, as well as Moment of Contact, which is about the Varginia Brazil UFO case. He's got great documentaries, but anyways. Jacques is famous for spending many years connecting the private sector to official USG investigation, and within this podcast, he references one of the entities that helps control the UFO phenomena, and the study of it in intelligence agencies is, quote, a private contractor. But Vall\u00e9e nervously states he does not wish to disclose who, in fact, has UFO materials. Fox comes to all of our rescue to suggest the name of the group indirectly by stating its involvement with the 1953 Robertson panel. As we studied above, this is Battel Memorial Institute. I honestly don't know if I'm able to use JRE clips from Spotify for copyright inclusion, so I'm not going to do that here. But if you wish to check this out, this is JRE, episode 1574, and begin at about an hour and 42 minutes in, where Jacques starts talking about pieces of metal recovered from UFOs. And this is where the discussion about what private industry has these materials and where Battel is suggested by Fox and Vall\u00e9e himself. And lastly, Battel actually has shocking connections to Arrow and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, our modern-day disinformation agent. Kirkpatrick and Arrow were directed to report to one Ronald Moultrie, the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and almost definitely one of the hostile witnesses on David Grush's list. If you'll remember from my Sean Kirkpatrick and Arrow video in 2022, Arrow and the DoD awarded a company called Sandcorp, a contract of $1.9 million for Arrow support services. This Sandcorp specializes in preventing leaks and stopping whistleblowers, okay, and guess who oversaw this contract? The Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security won Ronald Moultrie. Additionally, on the 16th December 2022, Ronald Moultrie and Sean Kirkpatrick actually held a public press conference that they have not seen evidence of crashed UFOs that suggest they are craft from another planet or dimension. They additionally suggest there have been no crash recoveries. So here, alongside Kirkpatrick, we see that Ronald Moultrie is vested and interested in playing down UAP and stopping whistleblowers, right? Well, the honorable Ronald Moultrie is actually a board member of Battelle, and has been since 2016, and worse yet, Moultrie has tried to scrub this from his record, including taking down his board membership from his LinkedIn page. But fortunately, Pogo.com stated on its website that Moultrie had been an advisory board member at Battelle, and fortunately grabbed screenshots before Moultrie took this down as I'm showing on screen right now. So even up to the modern day, Battelle has its hooks, sank in the USG, and is controlling the UAP narrative. So, Battelle, not only have they played their hand in investigating UFOs for the USG and Air Force, but they've also aided in quelling public interest in UFOs by saying there's nothing to them, and studying UFO material, such as Nitinol, which was likely recovered from the Roswell crash. Guys, if I can't stress this enough, the story of the EJ Center, in 1949, he worked for Battelle, studying the Nickel Titanium alloys, and this was not declassified until 2010, but in 1994, the Ohio Muffin General reported on EJ Center, who said he worked on parts of a flying saucer once he left Battelle in 58. That connection is just obscene, and really adds another kernel of credibility to this already baffling case with a ton of supporting evidence. I hope you guys enjoyed this look into Battelle. Battelle's hands are insanely dirty in UFOs. So is Lockheed Martin, so is the Carlisle Group. I will make videos about those as well, but I hope everybody learned something today. For the people in the know, and I know I have a lot of fans who probably know a lot more than I do in some aspects of UAP, there was a leaker online about eight months ago in 2023, I believe, who claimed he was a biologist at Battelle, working on EBOs, extraterrestrial biological organisms, if I think it is. He goes into the whole taxonomy of supposed aliens found and retrieved, crashed, and dead. I decided not to include that just because, of course, there is a possibility that is a LARP, and I don't have supporting evidence right now for those claims. They are quite insane. Maybe I'll do a video on that in the future too, but I know some of you guys are probably thinking why didn't he include that, why didn't he talk about that. But that's why, just because I can't put together a body of evidence and make a well-researched thesis for that, quote unquote, whistleblower. So maybe another time, give me 100 hours to look into that. But I hope you guys are having a great week. I am sure not. I'm sorry if I'm disheveled, I'm a huge UFC fan, and last night I had to watch my favorite fighter in the world, Alexander Volkanovsky, get knocked out. So I'm a little under the weather, so your guys' support means the most. Please remember to like and subscribe, and I will catch you guys on the next video.

And the idea was if they made a catcher's mitt, a security catcher's mitt for this shit, you know, most serious set possible, the contractor and the other government customer, which was the central intelligence agency, um, for that specific Lockheed material. And it was shit that they recovered from like the fifties and stuff. It was like bits and pieces of, of, of, of like hall structure or shit like that. How could in, so if an aerospace, and I've heard this theory from very informed people, I don't think it's a theory. It sounds true that if there are crash materials and apparently there, there are those reside in the custody of not the US government, but of contractors that work for the US government aerospace defense contract, right? McDonald Douglas, Lockheed, et cetera. My kids actually asked the same question and whenever I go on to business trips, I come home to ask me, how are the aliens? Did I see the aliens? Things like that. So yeah, do the aliens exist? That's a question for another time, but in terms of what we work on, yes, we do work on classified projects. In the field of ufology, Lockheed Martin, the US's biggest and most advanced aerospace and defense corporation, has been intimately woven with the study of UFOs. From reverse engineering attempts to material storage, Lockheed's name comes up again and again and again, and is specifically name dropped by credible individuals like David Grush and Gary Nolan, who we just saw. My friends, let's waste no time. I am your host, UAPGurve, and join me today as we analyze Lockheed Martin's deep history of UFOs and utilize facts and records to uncover this infamous piece of the military industrial complex's true involvement with the phenomenon. In 2021, late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said during a New York Times interview, quote, I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials. I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look at the stuff. They would not approve that. I don't know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would not give that to me. Before we try and uncover what Senator Reid was referencing, let's review some of Lockheed's accomplishments, so we understand just how advanced this company is. With annual revenues around the 60s of billions of US dollars, over half of Lockheed's annual sales go to, of course, the DOD and DOE, and has completed feats of military engineering marvels, such as the creation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the F-22 Raptor, the F-16, and the F-17 Nighthawk. Lockheed has also contributed greatly to the space age of man, creating space shuttle propellants, designing manned maneuvering units for spacewalks, and landed key contributions to satellite creations, and much, much more. And we are all deeply familiar with the famed Skunkworks division that is intertwined with DOD's special access programs, where top secret projects are conducted that result in vehicles that fly at Mach 3.2 at 100,000 feet, such as the SR-71, or the production of the first stealth fighter in the F-117. But what about projects deeper, or in an even more classified setting than the already shadowy Skunkworks? Lockheed Martin is legendary for having so much lore and whistleblowers surrounding the company's Black Division, but with an astonishingly thin paper trail and available evidence. You know me guys, we will do whatever it takes to critically analyze and separate fact from fiction, but going into this know that we don't have the same sort of records available to us as we did for Battelle. Lockheed Martin was not working closely with USAF and ATIC to investigate UFOs, and we don't have an exact paper trail of when Lockheed got UAP material or craft. So we will have to do our best to analyze all of the evidence. We'll start by reviewing some of the perplexing claims made by actual Lockheed Martin employees and head scientists, and yes, there are multiple and quite a few to review. Most who are familiar with Lockheed's connection to UFOs know about Ben Rich. The second Lockheed Skunkworks director and the father of the F-117. Just I'm sure as you guys know about his famed 1993 UCLA speech, where he allegedly stated, quote, we already have the means to travel among the stars. But these technologies are locked up in Black projects, and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity. Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do. I'm not here to push any unsubstantiated claims to back my thesis, guys. So did you know there's actually no video or audio evidence of Ben saying this? This is not to claim this quote is fabricated or that Rich wasn't interested in UFOs, but these quotes are recorded by author Linda Moulton-Howell, who is known to take some report of liberties. However, this exact quote appears to be confirmed in a 2010 MUFON article by one Tom Keller. But quite the contrary, on the 10th of July 1986, one John Alexander wrote to director Rich to expand on his statement of being a, quote, believer in UFOs. Andrew proposes that there are two categories of UFO and is interested to get Rich's thoughts, man-made and extraterrestrial vehicles. In a response letter, Ben Rich replies, quote, Dear John, yes, I'm a believer in both categories. I feel everything is possible. Many of our man-made UFOs are unfunded opportunities. In both categories, there are a lot of kooks and charlatans. Be cautious. Best regards, Ben Rich. Guys, please give me a congratulations for being able to decipher that cursive. It was not easy. The only discussion I can find around Rich's mentioned UCLA speech are some remarks made by MUFON director Jan Harzan, who actually attended the conference and can confirm some things that Rich said. He ended his talk with a slide of a black disc zipping off an outer space. And he ended it with these words, we now have the technology to take ET home. And the entire place broke up laughing. And Tom and I just looked at each other and said, did he really just say that? And are these people really not getting that what he's saying is real? So someone else asked the same question. So finally he just said, he said, well, he said, let me ask you a question. Do you think it's possible to travel to the stars? He asked this about a particular engineer who had asked him a question about his career. And the engineer said, well, I don't know, it just took a long time to get there. He said, no, it wouldn't. We've found an error in the equations and we now know how to travel to the stars. So we can't really confirm or deny Rich's supposed disclosure, but we can say that he did have an interest and understanding of man made versus non human intelligence UFOs. And next we have Don Phillips, who was an ex Lockheed Skunkworks, USAF and CIA contractor who told his story through Steven Greer's disclosure project in 2001. And this is when Greer was still doing largely respectable work to push disclosure. Phillips directly claimed that Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and quote, tremendous technological advances have come from their study. He also claimed in his interview with Greer, the US military did in fact acquire UFO craft from Roswell Lockheed, quote, really did put the technology to work. And Lockheed was intimately involved with anti gravity research. All of these things Phillips claimed. But frustratingly, vetting Phillips claimed background with Skunkworks and CIA has proved to be impossible for me. The only mention of Phillips I can find is a paper clipping from July 29, 1965, which confirms Phillips role in the Air Force as well as mentions him as a graduate of Pierce College. And fun fact guys, this is the same college that we can actually factually verify Bob Lazar went to. So analyze Phillips statements as you will. Personally, I view his role with Lockheed from a skeptical lens. I need verifiable proof that his role within the company was legitimate before I can judge more. However, some of the things he says about anti gravity, Roswell and reverse engineering UAP technology lines up almost exactly with some of the other gentlemen we're going to hear from. And next we move on to a controversial but very verifiable figure, Boyd Bushman. Bushman's deathbed claims of working on UAP R&amp;D for Lockheed released in 2014 and have become stuff of legend for UFO researchers. In this video, Boyd states that debris and materials were recovered from crash recoveries plural in New Mexico, likely Roswell and maybe the Kingman Arizona crash. He comments on the company's work with anti gravity and states his work on UAP craft concluded that these craft contain three key elements in their makeup, telluride, germanium and palladium. Worthy to note is that these materials Bushman suggests comprised UAP could be used to create a thermoelectrical slash photovoltaic generator with a semiconductor and capacitor as pure germanium was the first metallic material to become a superconductor in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Palladium is crucial to capacitors and telluride alloys have thermoelectric or photovoltaic properties. This isn't crucial to know you don't need to be a material scientist but this sort of material science led some credence to what Bushman claimed. Please feel free to view the whole testimony, of course the video will be in the description but I want to focus on Bushman himself. Boyd is a verified senior specialist and top secret SEI SAP cleared employee that served in Lockheed department 610-8, the special programs division. In 1999, Bushman came under FBI investigation for suspicious foreign contact. Lockheed became concerned about the potential of Boyd sharing sensitive information with what appears to be contacts in Prague and it's unknown if all of this contact was UAP related but from our investigation it looks like Boyd was contacting members in Prague to learn more about anti-gravity. Bushman was awarded numerous patents including strangely in 1997 a patent for a device that creates a magnetic monopole beam that emits pulses, levitates, degausses, stops electronics and separates materials. Monopoles currently are not proven to exist in the public or physics sector and are an incredibly interesting topic. I recommend checking out this video by PBS spacetime if you want to learn more about magnetic monopoles but Boyd was the real deal right? Well yeah except for the alien bodies he showed in photographs. The tiny looking gray creature can be traced back to a toy model originally claimed by an above top secret forum thread in 2008 to be a Kmart Halloween decoration from the late 1990s. No verifiable evidence can be drawn to the toys listing however this is not a great look for Bushman. Whether purposeful or accidental disinformation I'm not sure but with the presence of the two we are faced with three options that some government agency had some toy company that made models make up alien toys that appeared similar to the real aliens that resided in Area 51 or Groom Lake so that if photos were ever leaked like they were with Bushman they could leak photos of the toy as a way to discredit any whistleblower. Option two is that the photo of the model alien was given to Bushman in order to discredit him and take away from his story and three of course Boyd purposefully pushed the photo of the toy for whatever reason and now we arrive to the last and probably the best and most credible speaker with regards to employment in Lockheed, Bernard Haish. PhD astrophysicist Haish performed astonishing work for Lockheed including the publishing of a paper for the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center with physicist Hal Putoff. The paper focused on zero point energy of the quantum vacuum. The study specifically looked at one or more resonant frequencies that may be associated with quantum vacuum interaction for propulsion purposes. I'll mention this again soon so keep that study in mind. In 2001 Haish wrote an essay titled Black Special Access Programs. He had created a site called UFOSkeptic.org. Don't let this site name fool you he just wanted scientists to come together to analyze UAP with a little bit more of a critical lens. To respect our time I am just going to summarize this article I'm not going to read the whole thing but Haish essentially confirms the world we came to know in 2023 with the revelations of David Grush that these black special access programs on crash retrieval and reverse engineering can be quite independent of any given administration and it's unrealistic to think that Freedom of Information Act requests and even presidential administrations can penetrate and read into these programs that over time these black budget programs become extremely independent and to trace their origin instead of intelligence they most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics. What is even more astounding however are the comments Haish made to the public in 2018 after the existence of ATIP was revealed to the American public. He said quote the following is conjecture sources tell me that this is merely the tip of the iceberg a group of four related but separate unacknowledged SCI programs tracing back to a 1947 Truman memorandum still exist and were housed as of the 1990s guys remember the Wilson Davis Memo and the reorganization of SAPs in that time in major aerospace companies such as for example Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corps, etc these would be expensive programs since the cost of secrecy can be several times higher than research the ATIP program has no relation to these four much better funded deep black ones indeed the black programs collectively have budgets in the 10 billion range and up topics apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology the ATIP did find the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels but was denied access to it because ATIP itself is not a SAP. Senator Harry Reid petitioned the DOD to confer SAP status to ATIP but the DOD denied his request and lastly guys while not a Lockheed employee let's take a look at USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch. Fausch has made some astounding statements on Lockheed with some really weird evidence to back it. In 1998 the Master Sergeant states he temporarily worked at the Defense Advanced Research Center, DARSE, in 1979 which he claims is a facility beneath Groom Lake with at least 10 underground stories. Fausch states he was recruited to DARSE while working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. He claimed that triangular craft had been reverse engineered by UAP contracted by none other than Lockheed Martin. The Sergeant coined the now famous term the TR-3B which is synonymous with human-made reverse engineered triangular shaped craft and states three prototypes have been reverse engineered by efforts at Sandia and Livermore dating back to the early 1990s and was the first attempt at a gravity warping craft. What is truly wild here is we can confirm not only Fausch's military record but also the fact he was actually stationed at the famed Area 51. Look here guys Ed was assigned to Debt-3 AFFTC which is the organization at the Air Force Flight Test Center responsible for operations at Area 51 Groom Lake but of course Ed's line because the DARSE, the Defense Advanced Research Center is not part of DARPA right? Well look guys a declassified study from the Advanced Research Project Agency ARPA shows advanced aerospace projects were performed by Warner Von Braun's team at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency ABMA. A draft by the DOD directive shows the ABMA was considered for a transfer into a quote defense advanced research center that would be inherently linked to JPL. It's unconfirmed if DARSE was actually created and if any advanced aerospace concepts from Von Braun made their way there but look guys DARSE is actually a theoretical place. As mentioned by Bushman, Haish, and Phillips Lockheed has engaged with some incredibly strange and exotic technologies that appear like they're straight out of science fiction. Can we confirm any of this work like anti-gravity or strange propulsion methods? Well in 1955 physicist Lou Witten states that he was recruited by one George Trimble the current VP for aviation and advanced propulsion systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company. The Glenn L. Martin Company eventually evolved into Martin Marietta which merged with Lockheed in 95. Anyways Witten states that he was recruited into the Research Institute for Advanced Studies, the RIAS. Witten stated that Trimble recruited him to help develop anti-gravity and in 2013 actually stated that the team discovered techniques to harness anti-gravity in this project. Witten suggested several ideas were tested including utilizing an isotope of bismuth but he does not expand on this. And shocking enough we actually have the journal evidence to prove that this research took place. And if you want to see Lou Witten talk about this look at the link I've provided and go to about an hour 49-22. The anti-gravity rabbit hole runs deep way deeper than the discussion by Bushman Phillips and Fausch. I'll cover this in another time guys because the anti-gravity starting on about 1955 this research is fascinating. But remember how I mentioned in 1998 Hesh and Putoff published a paper on zero point energy in the quantum vacuum? If you don't know real fast zero point energy is the lowest possible energy level or ground state in a quantized electromagnetic field which interacts with a physical system of particles. In a quantum vacuum vacuums must always crackle with fluctuations in the quantum field that fill these never-ending fluctuations imbue every field with some minimum amount of energy known as the zero point energy. Guys you don't need to pay attention to that just know that this is pretty breakthrough stuff but theoretically impossible zero point energy. But if you look to 2017 inventor Salvador Pais and the naval air station were awarded a patent for a similar concept for a triangular shaped craft that utilize specific frequencies to interact with the quantum vacuum and generate anti-gravitic capabilities. Sounds like UAP right? Well on the 22nd of August 1998 now retired Lieutenant Colonel Ron Blackburn of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks and co-founder of the ATP group at BDM International was awarded a patent for technology that increased aerodynamic and hydrodynamic efficiency of a vehicle in motion that includes a sketch of a disc. Several years later Blackburn states on a podcast he reverse engineered the capabilities to eliminate sonic booms at high speeds by using videos of disc-shaped craft he had access to. Guys think about this this has multiple of the observables of UAP by Lou Elizondo the ability to operate in trans-medium remember the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency as well as travel at mock speeds without the presence of a sonic boom this sounds like UAP technology. Guys this is a UAP group video so let's analyze all the documents we can. Believe it or not Lockheed has had some interesting encounters with official USG record keeping such as this 1953 UFO sighting where Lockheed test pilots and ground crew observe a flying disc with anomalous acceleration characteristics three men also swore this sighting as testimony the sighting was submitted to bluebook but was never listed again curiously and guys think back to my video on the Wilson Davis memo where Wilson Davis states the watch committee of the Black UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering program he discovered within the SAP logs told him they were almost outed due to an audit well check this out guys on the 24th of July 1986 the director of the US general accounting office GAO's national security and international affairs division Frank C. Conahan testified at a subcommittee on oversight and investigation Conahan stated that Lockheed exhibited a poor document control system over classified special access documents and had zero oversight from the DOD program office it was then that the GAO stated the defense investigation service was actually not allowed to conduct the semi-annual inspects of the aerospace contract in question and 1460 discrepancies were found in an inventory of 40 000 documents with Lockheed an estimated 46 documents were destroyed and 17 were transferred out of the company and were never discovered guys this sounds extremely suspicious the poor document control system of Lockheed and somehow missing 46 documents and a full 1460 discrepancies well this strangeness and Lockheed's hand in deep special access programs above even DOD oversight does not end here in June of 2004 former assistant secretary of housing and urban development Catherine Austin Fitz wrote a paper titled The Black Budget of the United States this paper says that quote a large proportion of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels to support clandestine domestic military r&amp;d she states she discovered evidence that Lockheed Martin information systems were responsible for the obfuscation of justice and may have data on the siphon DOD funds Lockheed at this time was one of the subcontractors to IBM as hired by the Pentagon to manage systems that failed a GAO audit so we have to think all of this taking place all of Lockheed's kind of shadiness around DOD and mistracking of funds are they involved with the audit as spoke about in the Wilson Davis memo and to add the icing on top here guys in 2000 commander Will Miller yes the same Miller from the Wilson Davis memo told attorney Peter Gersten that senior government officials such as a DIA director are isolated from UAP knowledge quote the keepers of the secrets reside in DOD middle management and civilian contractors like SAIC Boeing and Lockheed and are basically the comptrollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs black triangles are a legendary shape of UFO seen for decades and are the responsible craft behind the 1989 Belgian UFO wave well what if I told you that there's a paper trail of evidence that suggests this black triangle commonly known as the TR3B is actually a Lockheed Martin UAP reverse engineering program called project Astra Aurora the first mention we can find of Aurora is in the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1986 and 1987 where 80 million was planned to be spent on an Aurora program in 86 and 2.3 billion in 87 for reference this was more than double the cost of the b2 spirit bomber in fact in 1997 John Greenwald of the black vault inquired into Aurora but was denied any sort of access then in the late 1990s we can go back to author Nick Cook of the hunt for zero point who interviewed former head of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks Jack Gordon while leading the plant in Palmdale Nick Cook saw a large chart illustrating the lineage of every Skunkworks aircraft since the XP80 past the Dark Star which is the plane in the film Top Gun Maverick there was something called Astra an ultra high-speed reconnaissance craft that looked triangular in shape and it looked similar to some of the triangle seen in Belgium in the early 90s and when Cook asked Gordon was flustered and denied Astra was anything but an old airliner and while we're here let's not forget about the triangle shaped craft Fausch claimed Lockheed possession was actively reverse engineering at Darse and do you guys remember the release of the Calvin UFO photo in 2022-2023 which was taken in Scotland and depicts a large triangle diamond shaped UFO that was referenced by the British Ministry of Defense well if you look closely at former project Condon that was the Ministry of Defense's official UFO investigation program the Calvin UFO photo is listed as Astra slash Aurora photos among other 35 millimeter slides that don't appear on this last file this could be very significant as in this same M.O.D. Condon report the Brits were interested in investigating UAP sourced from USG contractor projects and this Aurora slash Astra may be listed here was even more interesting to note this Condon report took special interest of triangle sightings as seen here in the executive summary page of the report and it appears the British had taken a keen interest in Aurora or Astra as a USG UAP triangle craft reverse engineered because back in the 22nd of December 1992 the British Embassy in Washington DC wrote to a assistant chief of air staff in London regarding the USG's reaction to triangular UAP citing specifically a sighting that occurred three years earlier by a British royal observer core member this investigation into USAF caused quote considerable irritation by the Brits and the British officials who monitored the USG reaction are quoted as saying Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice was to say the least incensed by the renewed speculation that he had lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist so as we can see guys a lot more work needs to be done investigating Aurora slash Astra but these strings connect triangular shaped craft to both Lockheed Martin and USAF and that the British M.O.D had a keen interest in finding out what the heck these things were. What's up guys I hope you enjoyed this look into Lockheed Martin and UAPs as you can see after watching this video there are a ton of public figures who make pretty bold claims about Lockheed and while these claims are most likely true as confirmed by Grush and other key people it's really hard to actually get to the bottom of this if you see our paper trail is not exceedingly long we have Lockheed Martin interacting with Blue Book in the 50s and we have our audit trail that you know very likely is involved with the audit mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo that the watch committee had to basically reorganize SAP status in the 90s to hide themselves better but what do you guys think is is Lockheed as much of a player in the reverse engineering and material exploitation of UAP as Patel I personally think so yes but they are just a lot harder to track down as our nation's largest defense contractor I imagine they have some pretty darn good record systems too keep stuff like this out what did you guys think of the witnesses I'd say order of most credible to least credible we got Bernard Haish Boyd Bushman and Don Phillips Don Phillips it's unfortunate I can't verify his background so it's really hard for me to take his word as gospel Boyd Bushman a really interesting witness says some interesting things but the toy alien I more analysis needs to be done there but quite frankly I'm not sure where to go from there but in addition the Aurora Astra could be its own hour long documentary but I just wanted to do a a summary an overview of what's going on because there's a lot more to Aurora Astra including aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish seen something called the TR3B or the triangular shaped craft in Lockheed Martin while leaving a facility and so forth so there's a lot more to dive into guys maybe I'll do that someday but I need a little bit more information on Aurora Astra some concrete information to make another video because this video is a lot of speculation for for what I like pushing the boundaries of speculation versus fact but this was an exhausting list of facts and data to make so please give a like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next show and before you go in victory or defeat I support the best athlete in the world Alexander Volkanovsky goodbye everybody</p>"},{"location":"video-pages/tVdzvvbbHW4/#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<ul> <li>People:</li> <li>ABMA</li> <li>ATIP</li> <li>Alexander Volkanovsky</li> <li>Andrew</li> <li>Anyways Witten</li> <li>Astra Aurora</li> <li>Aurora</li> <li>Aurora Astra</li> <li>Ben</li> <li>Ben Rich</li> <li>Bernard Haish</li> <li>Bernard Haish</li> <li>Blackburn</li> <li>Bob Lazar</li> <li>Boyd</li> <li>Boyd Bushman</li> <li>Bushman</li> <li>Bushman Phillips</li> <li>Catherine Austin Fitz</li> <li>Conahan</li> <li>Condon</li> <li>Cook</li> <li>DOD</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>David Grush</li> <li>Davis</li> <li>Davis Memo</li> <li>Don Phillips</li> <li>Donald B.

The MJ-12 was brought to light from a series of contested leaked documents discussing the group. During 1984-1999, over 109 documents containing 3,500 pages were leaked to UFO researchers detailing the shadowy organization and its members. From Generals such as Nathan Twinning to scientists like Dr. Vannevar Bush and J. Robert Oppenheimer, the MJ-12 has allegedly included some of the 20th century's best and brightest. </p> <p>Debate has raged on for decades but respected UFO researchers Stanton Friedman and Ryan/Robert Wood have argued for the authenticity of many of the documents and the MJ-12 group due to decades of rigorous study on the documents' context, provenance, discussion, and connective tissue to other MJ-12 Documents and declassified documents. </p> <p>The MJ12 has long been considered a conspiracy especially after a haphazard and lazy debunk by the FBI.

This now infamous group was revealed through hundreds of allegedly leaked documents over the course of 1984 to 1999 to be titled the Majestic 12 or MJ12. Any viewer of my work will know I often reference the majestic documents in MJ12, such as my Dell Rio case where I bring up the majestic document called the Eisenhower Briefing Document, in which I reference a December 1950 UFO crash retrieval stated to have occurred near the Mexican-Texas border between El Indio and Guerrera. A crash retrieval Lou Elizondo has now stated to have occurred in his 2024 book Eminent. So with the contentious nature surrounding the majestic documents in ufology, the debunking work done by professional skeptic Philip K Glass and others, alongside the FBI's work to haphazardly write bogus across one set of documents to label all documents as false, why cover the majestic documents? To me, the analysis of MJ12 and the majestic documents must consist of studying the documents themselves. Their origins, content, provenance, and connective tissue to not only other majestic documents but also acknowledged and declassified files, like the work done by the legendary Stanton Friedman and world-class Ryan S. Wood. This is why today I have partnered with fantastic UFO researcher Ryan S. Wood to explore the majestic documents. Ryan and his father, Dr. Robert Wood, a former McDonald-Douglas rocket scientist, have spent decades painstakingly scrutinizing the entire catalog of majestic documents to unravel the mystery that is the Majestic 12. Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so very much for joining the author of Magic Eyes Only and myself as we discuss the authenticity, origin, and context of the majestic documents. With the revelations of David Grush in the 21st century, the reality of UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering has made its way into the public zeitgeist. This is why we must take a closer inspection of the highly debated group allegedly first tasked with UFO crash retrievals, the Majestic 12. Before we get into the interview, I want to take a brief moment to introduce the Majestic 12 for any newcomer to the subject. I highly recommend reading Top Secret Magic by Stanton Friedman, StudyingMajesticDocuments.com written by Ryan and Dr. Bob, my all-time favorite book, Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood, or reading the incredible medium articles by Blocked Epistemology. The Majestic 12 is a group known from a series of controversial leaked documents to have been tasked with UFO study, collection, and analysis. The group seemingly rose to power around the time of the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash, but with origins extending even earlier around 1941 or 1942. According to Stanton Friedman, the group allegedly consisted of 12 members, MJ-1 through 12, consisting of six civilian and six military personnel. Of the military people, two representatives each from the Army, Navy, and Air Force served in the MJ-12. The private sector saw seasoned research and development organizers and very strong intelligence community leaders participate in the group. Viewers of my Robert Sarbakar video will remember Dr. Vannevar Bush, head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, who was labeled a crucial founding member of the Majestic 12. Other original members named in the Majestic documents include General Nathan Twining, the leader of Project Sine, a.k.a. Project Saucer in 1948, James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy and First U.S. Secretary of Defense, who conveniently threw himself out of a hospital window in 1949, Donald H. Menzel, astronomer at Harvard and high security consultant to the NSA and CIA, Roscoe H. Hillencoder, Admiral Navy Intelligence and First Director of the CIA. Walter B. Smith, General in the U.S. Army, Ambassador to the USSR, Second Director of the CIA, and Forrestal's replacement. And Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF General, Second Director of the Central Intelligence Group, Air Force Chief of Staff. And this is just a slice of the total members. I highly recommend analyzing the MJ-12 master list created by Ryan Wood. Many over the years have hypothesized what the magic in MJ-12 stands for. After Blocked Epistemology hypothesizes this name is derived from the 1945 May Johnson Atomic Energy Bill. Excellent Reddit researcher, user HarryIsWhiteHot, believed magic was some sort of continuation of a very high classification standard titled MAGIC, used during World War II. I find myself believing magic is an abbreviation for a Joint Intelligence Committee, possibly something along the lines of a Majority Joint Intelligence Committee-12. But without further ado, let's talk to Ryan S. Wood and begin to dive into the origins of the documents. Yeah, well, the broad brush is that there's some 3,500 pages over 19 years from seven different sources. The first event was in 1984, when Jamie Chandra, which was an L.A. producer, a TV producer I believe, received the Eisenhower Briefing Document, which Stan Friedman ultimately got in, outlines the original 12 MJ-12 members in that document. And that's the one that was taken around to the FBI and several people submitted it to the FBI, because the FBI is responsible for leaks of classified documents. And the FBI took it to a variety of three-letter agencies and said, did you lose this? And they said, well, no, we didn't lose this, we don't know anything about it. And so after their process, they declared it bogus. Despite the efforts of Stan Friedman to authenticate a whole variety of people that were MJ-12 members, and then the other two different sources for that same document that came into the field years after that. Some with different marginalia, some with slightly different three-hole punching. And so, I mean, they aren't stunningly authentic in original paper or something like that, but there are some other sources of that same document that have surfaced over time. But it was a briefing for Eisenhower, and that was the first one. And that sort of kicked things off and got Stan Friedman really pushing along. Returning viewers of my channel will know the first ever Majestic document quite well, the top secret magic eyes only Eisenhower briefing document. This document stating to contain compartmentalized information essential to US national security was organized to brief president incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower on the Majestic 12 group on November 18, 1952. The document labels Operation Majestic 12 as a top secret R&amp;D slash intelligence operation reporting solely to the president of the United States. Set up by a classified executive order of President Harry Truman by recommendation of Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary Forrestal on the 24th of September 1947. Funny enough, in the daily appointment history of Harry Truman, we can find a meeting with Secdef James Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush arranged at the suggestion of Forrestal. The briefing document includes a list of all 12 sitting MJ12 members including General Walter B. Smith who replaced the deceased secretary Forrestal on August 1, 1950. And again, we can find an actual appointment held off record with Truman and Walter B. Smith on this exact date. The briefing document discusses the hysteria caused by saucer sightings of Kenneth Arnold in the summer of 1947 and subsequent failures to pursue these discs in flight. July 7, 1947, oversaw the beginning of the MJ12 with the Roswell crash. Northwest of Roswell Army Airfield experienced the now most famous UFO crash in history, which according to the Eisenhower briefing document saw craft and body collection efforts by General Nathan Twining and Dr. Vannevar Bush. A soon to be sitting MJ12 member, Dr. Detlev Bronk performed autopsies on the bodies and coined the term EBE, or Extraterrestrial Biological Entity. The Roswell team and Dr. Donald Menzel concluded the craft was of non-human origin and likely originated from a solar system far removed from our own. The report discusses forms of writing on the Roswell craft, something primary witness Jesse Marcel Sr. and Jr. would claim to witness on a small piece of metallic debris. The Roswell report led directly to the creation of projects Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book with very limited interaction between these official programs and the Majestic 12. And I'll draw your attention back to a whistleblower I covered, Brigadier General Stephen Lovekin, who claimed to have observed pieces of Roswell debris in a classified portion of Project Blue Book far removed from the official reports. The document then discusses the 1950 L Indio crash, touched on in 2024 by Lou Elizondo and makes specific mention of the Atomic Energy Commission and Sandia National Labs. Curiously, near the end of the document is listed a contingency plan, MJ-1949-04, P-7-8, and just remember that contingency plan. Tireless work was done by Stanton Friedman authenticating the Eisenhower Briefing document in his book Top Secret Slash Magic. But there are two specific investigations I want to mention. In 1989, Friedman physically traveled to the National Archives and reviewed files of the Office for the Secretary of Defense. Within these documents were numerous November 18, 1952 briefing documents for President-Elect Eisenhower. None of these briefings mentioned MJ-12, but it is fact the Truman administration was indeed briefing Eisenhower on this date. Investigation 2 circles around the labeled briefing officer Admiral Rosco H. Hillencoder. Debunkers of the Majestic documents claim Hillencoder was sent to Korea in 1950 for six years. However, Friedman was able to determine Hillencoder was indeed present in Brooklyn, New York in late 1952 when he was made head of the Third Naval District in New York. So Hillencoder could have indeed been present at the Washington briefings on November 1952. And many MJ-12 files with Hillencoder as a key individual exist, though they do require further research. Such as this February 11, 1948 Hillencoder to Truman Majestic Black Book Summaries document, which makes direct mention to MAGIC. Or the September 19, 1963 CIA Director Hillencoder to Donald Menzel Memo, which sees the director congratulating his fellow alleged MJ-12 member on his book regarding what we can assume was successful obfuscation of the UFO reality. And lastly, we have some key clues on a September 19, 1947 memo from Hillencoder to Joint Intelligence Committee. This majestic document memo allegedly dated just before Bush and Forestall's request to create MJ-12 is titled, quote, Memorandum for the Military Assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee, end quote, aka MAGIC. The memo requests a classified intelligence project, quote, we recovered one craft, captured one, end quote. This memo states no clear coordinated scientific examination was possible until, quote, we got a clear directive from the president. The memo also states Wright Field had a new biological laboratory, the Joint Research and Development Board, and the FBI, MI5 and MI6 were helping with the effort. And finally, guys, back to Mr. Wood. The other one that's really big is the Special Operations Manual, Extraterrestrial Antities Technology Recovery and Disposal. And that was leaked in 1994 to Don Berliner, who was an aviation week and space reporter in Washington, D.C. And it was an undeveloped film. I came in a little green box and they went and my father and I and, well, not me, but my father and Don went to the dark room and developed it and got all the original images. I'll just pull a couple sheets out just for fun to show you. This is, you know, came in an echo binder along the edge over here and also became with the Change Control page, which is difficult to see, but it says Kirkland Air Force Base Unit KB-88 Building 21, Kirkland Air Force Base, N.M.X. We found that there was a Building 21, I think it's now called Building 40, back then. And the fact that the abbreviation for the stamp, Kirkland Air Force Base, N.M.X, is the correct postal abbreviation for 1954 for New Mexico. If it said NM, that would have been a hallmark of fakery or an anachronism that would be worthy of lots of investigation. Mr. Wood and myself will speak on the Special Operations Manual throughout this video, so we will only go into brief detail here. The manual according to Ryan Wood, Dr. Robert Wood, and Stanton Friedman is equally, if not more authentic than the Eisenhower Briefing Document. Friedman has even stated, quote, the Majestic 12 documents problem is complex and extensive. On balance, it appears that the EBD, TFM, and CTM are almost certainly genuine. The SOM-101 likely genuine, end quote. Debate has raged on for decades now, if the document is a hoax, real, or possibly Soviet disinformation. Later in the interview, we will do an entire analysis into the Special Operations Manual, or the SOM-101 as I'll refer to it. But for now, understand this manual, allegedly written in 1954 and initially housed in Kirkland Air Force Base, serves as a comprehensive summary of majestic operations for quote unquote, Majestic 12 units, and quote unquote, authorized personnel. The manual contains everything from MJ-12 full operational capacity and modus operandi, NHI craft and body descriptions, to MJ-12 recovery and disinformation protocols. Similar to his masterpiece, Magic Eyes Only, Ryan Wood has attributed a weighted authenticity rating to every document based on factors such as direct firsthand witnesses, forensic analysis if possible, document source, etc. The Special Operations Manual and Eisenhower Briefing Document are two of the few pieces Wood has rated with the highest level of authenticity. But are there others with such high confidence? But I would also add the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit document, because the governments acknowledged the existence of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, part of the Stephen J. Chamberlain Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Technical and Scientific Directorate, Counterintelligence Group, IPU Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. You know, all these hierarchies down in the, you know, 40s time frame. Well, this was 47 where the IPU document. But what's interesting about the IPU document, which is on majesticdocuments.com, people can read it. And in my book, Magic Eyes Only, is details about the Roswell crash, you know, when it crashed at 2332 Mountain Standard Time and dropped off radar. And it had discussions of body parts inside the craft in the handwritten notes. And it had discussions of autopsies of the aliens done by Dietliff Bronk and Charles Ethan Ray, which, you know, when I started to look around, I said, who's who's Charles Ethan Ray? And he was a medical core expert with Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. And and I called up his daughter in Seattle and said, you know, do you think your father could have autopsied an alien? And she didn't hesitate at all and said, yes, not that she knew that he did it, but it's clear in her mind that, oh, absolutely, this is the sort of stuff he would have been tapped to do. So I mean, there, there's just more and more details, stories about the IPU and that document. And so those three, I mean, each one has its own basket of interesting facts and authenticity. Viewers of this channel will know recently, I have been discussing the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, the US Army's in-house unofficial department in the 50s for an assistant chief of staff for intelligence to study UFOs. The IPU initially discovered through FOIA requests after initial DoD denial exists only through quote unquote institutional memory. I highly recommend reading Anthony Bergoglia's piece on the IPU. The existence of this division was first revealed on September 6, 1980, in a FOIA request by Richard Hall and later confirmed in a 1984 FOIA request by UFO researcher William Steinman. It took until the 1990s for the USG to state all records were destroyed. Even though Hall's 1980 request oversaw the Army Director of Counterintelligence state all IPU records were surrendered to Blue Book. Anyways, as Ryan stated on MajesticDocuments.com, we can find two IPU documents within the MJ-12 documents, IPU Field Order and IPU Report. The Interplanetary Phenomenon Field Order lists a July 4, 1947 correspondence of a situation occurring the day before the memo requesting personnel including an aeronautical engineer and medical doctor cleared for quote need to know end quote. And this date should ring a bell as occurring right before the Roswell crash. The IPU report first made its way into the public on July 16, 1995 and lists astonishing information authorized by Lieutenant General John A. Samford and approved by CIA Director Alan Dolis. Some of you may remember Samford giving the famous press conference alongside Roswell General Roger Raimi post the 1952 UFOs over Washington DC incident. This document explores in great detail the events of the Roswell UFO including initial tracking and assessment of the two sites of the crash to disk. A very key clue in this document is the mention that some Roswell Army airfield investigators at LZ-1, the debris field seen by Brazel and Marcel, thought the wreckage may have been a project mogul balloon until Los Alamos personnel determined the wreckage was something quote unquote out of this world. If you know anything about the Roswell crash, you'll know it's often explained away as a project mogul balloon. And this was revealed after the initial weather balloon cover story in the U.S. Air Force's 1994 report, The Roswell Report. The Roswell Report states the mogul flight that was misidentified as a large metallic flying saucer with bodies was mogul flight number four which allegedly launched on June 4, 1947. However, in 2024 project mogul's field operations director Dr. Alan Crary revealed with evidence flight number four never took place on this day and was indeed canceled due to weather. Anyways, the IP report states a radio biological team and security detail from Sandia National Labs were summoned by Colonel S.B. Housebrook. Chosen scientists consisted of AEC personnel including J. Robert Oppenheimer, Werner von Braun and others. And before you say this sounds too fantastical, remember von Braun's mentor Herman Osberth performed serious analysis on UFO flight characteristics. Twining Vandenberg and others are named within this report as aiding in the recovery effort and overall operation. And an interesting line here, quote, it has become known to CIC that some of the recovery operation was shared with Representative John F. Kennedy, end quote. I'm not going to spend too much more time on the IPU report, but as Wood stated, Detlef Bronk is named as assisting in the autopsy. The report then discusses the NHI bodies, body parts seemingly dissected similar to a frog scattered at the primary crash site and the death of multiple Sandia lab techs due to a form of contamination. And I recently discussed this contamination in my 1974 Koyama Mexico crash retrieval case. Based on the documents, Ryan Wood has the most confidence are in fact legitimate. I asked him to describe robustly what exactly compromises the Majestic 12, how various named members fit into the group and the impact such an organization had on ufology at the time of the initial MJ 12 documents being leaked. Well, it's a top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization that was formed by executive order the president in September 24, 1947. You know, 1947 was when the atomic energy act was created when the CIA was created and sort of the OSS was transitioned office of strategic services, which was the CIA at the time into the CIA. And, and they formed this top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization. And it was, you know, headed by Vannevar Bush, part of the Office of Research and Development, OSRD. And this is where Eric Walker, Dr. Eric Walker lived working for Vannevar Bush and ultimately took over the organization and was widely understood to be familiar with MJ 12 while leading it in that group. So the names of the people caught a lot of attention and Stan did a lot of work and has written his book, Top Secret Magic, I think, which highlights a lot of the research around the various people. He dug into Carl Sagan, which was a person that shouldn't have been on the list sort of, you know, he was a big debunker. And, but when Stan finally went to the various archives and dug around, he found lots of correspondence between other MJ 12 members. And, and so that was, you know, interesting and, and powerful for the authenticity of the document. But it was again, it was a photocopy. Well, actually it was filmed. It was, it was undeveloped film, just like the special operations manual that arrived. It might have been from the same source, but it certainly wasn't mailed the same way. Pay close attention here to the name of Dr. Eric A. Walker. In my video on physicist Robert Sarbakar, I discussed how Dr. Sarbakar directly named Vannevar Bush as a key figure studying UFOs within the US government. During conversations with Stanton Friedman, Dr. Sarbakar, who was a member of Bush's Research and Development Board, mentioned Dr. Eric A. Walker as a key figure connected to UFO crash retrievals. Walker was contacted by researcher William Steinman and not only confirmed the existence of the Majestic 12, but actually admitted his own presence at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash retrieval. I highly recommend revisiting my video here. So, I mean, going to the special operations manual that you mentioned with the Ray Z, there's so many hallmarks of authenticity in that particular document. I could start with the fact that we took it to a retired government printing officer general, not general, but MacArthur in Washington, DC. He retired from the US government printing office maybe like six months before we visited him and we went to his house and set it up on a card table and slid the document across and he looked at it and said, well, you know, by the title, Extraterrestrial Entities Technology Recovery Disposal, I would think it's fake. But then he flipped through the documents and saw the disease were raised and said, oh, this is an artifact of hot lead printing press, besides the fact that he checked it for everything. I mean, he said the fonts are right. The indentations are correct. The use of M-dashes in MJ-12 long-dash clearance is correct. The capitalization of first aid was correct for the period. So, he went through a bunch of subtleties that we didn't understand or perceive at the time to highlight the fact that it was real in his mind and ultimately concluded that, yeah, the CIA probably printed it in a cage down on 10th Street. That was his opinion at the time. With Mr. Wood passionately discussing his authentication methods of the MJ-12 Special Operations Manual, now is the perfect time to discuss the contents of this absolutely mind-boggling document. Psalm 1 was sent anonymously to Don Berliner in 1994 and consisted of undeveloped 35 millimeter triax film authenticated to 1954. Labeled top secret magic eyes only, the manual details the full operational capacity and mission of the Majestic 12. As mentioned by Mr. Wood, we see the document control is regressed to a singular stamp of Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The document control page shows us MJ-12 members, MJ-01 and MJ-04, who altered the document from 1954 to 1958. Initials listed here are EWL and JRT. Two names Ryan has actually tracked and we will discuss shortly. And now we get into the meat of this document. Quote, this manual has been prepared especially for Majestic 12 units, end quote. Its purpose is to present all aspects of MJ-12, so authorized personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the group, be able to more expertly deal with UFOs, ET tech and entities and increase the efficiency of future operations. Section one, project goals and purposes of this document make some startling revelations. One, MJ-12 considers unidentified flying objects UFO bees to be a matter of the very highest order of national security. Two, there would be a negative impact on the public with general knowledge of the UFO situation. Three, danger present if advanced tech falls into the hands of adversaries. And four, MJ-12 was established on the 24th of September 1947 under recommendation by Vannevar Bush and Forestall. The goals of MJ-12 are clearly outlined here as well. One, recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of foreign or ET manufacture. Recovery by any and all means by group. This immediately reminds me of the 1974 Koyama case with the American retrieval team finding the craft in Mexico at all costs. Two, recovery for study of all entities and remains of entities of non-terrestrial origin through independent action by those entities or by misfortune or military action. Well, naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots. And believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds, it's true. Three, establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above operations, which reminds me for the third video in a row of Christopher Sharpe's article on the CIA, OGA and JSOC being behind crash retrieval operations. Four, establishment and admin of special secure facilities located at secret locations within USA for providing receiving, processing, analysis and study of any and all materials and entities classified as extraterrestrial. Five, covert operations carried in collusion with the CIA both home and abroad. And six, establishment and absolute secrecy of all operations. As of the time of the alleged creation of this document in 1954, MJ-12 does not consider NHI to be a threat, consisting of a benign presence but with technology far beyond human science. The group had in possession several recovered dead biologics. Section one general begins to define the scope of the majestic 12, determination, documentation, collection and disposition of debris, devices, craft and occupants. This section defines ET technology as aircraft not manufactured by human power, objects that appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics, consisting of materials exhibiting characteristics beyond science. And this section even describes EBEs, creatures humanoid or otherwise whose evolutionary process differs demonstrably from that of Homo sapiens. And now we get to my favorite part of this entire document, the description of the craft. Elliptical or disc shaped craft appear to be metallic and dull in color, whose appearance consists of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together. Psalm 101 even lists some dimensions of these craft, they are 50 to 300 feet in diameter, with their thickness near 15% of the total diameter. A dome extends above the disc, about 30% of the disc diameter and extends four to six feet above the main body. This dome may or may not include windows or ports. Lights on the craft exist on the top, bottom and rim that only function during operation. There's no antenna or projections, but there are three extendable sets of landing gear. Cigar shape or tic-tacs are considered very rare. They can be 2000 feet long and 95 feet thick. They do not operate in lower atmosphere and travel at excess of 7k miles per hour. They do not engage in the rapid erratic or instantaneous maneuvers the smaller craft do. The ovoid circular or teardrop shapes look almost like an ice cream cone, round at the large end and tapering to a near point at the other. They are 30 to 40 feet long and have a diameter 20% of the length. The craft have a bright light at the end point and the craft travels pointing down. And lastly we have the airfoil or triangular shape. These were considered new tech due to rarity of recent observations. The craft appear to be an isosceles triangle with their longest side being near 300 feet length. Little was known about the performance capabilities, but they operated apparently similar to the disc or ovoid shape. SOM101 then begins to go into description of extraterrestrial biological entities listing a type 1 and type 2 and thank you to Bill McDonald for the art here. EBE1's luck humanoid, they are 5 to 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighing 80 to 100 pounds. They have larger, more rounded craniums with chalky yellow, thick, slightly pebbled pale skin. They have small eyes, white set that are almost almond shape, with brownish black irises and very large pupils and gray whites. Their mouths are wide, nearly lipless. They have fine hair, not confined to underarm and groin. Their body is thin with no fat and good muscles. EBE1 has small hands, four long digits, no thumb, but webbing. The description of the type 2 EBE will remind you as much more of a classic gray. They are humanoid, but 3 feet 5 inches to 4 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 25 to 50 pounds. Their large, elongated head is larger proportionally to that of a human or EBE1. Their eyes are large, slanted, and nearly wrap around their head, showing only pure black. The nose appears to be two small slits above a slit like mouth with no external ears. Their skin is pale blue grayish, fine-celled, and smooth. They have no hair, leading MJ12 to believe these creatures are not mammalian. Their hands have three long fingers plus a long thumb. They have four toes jointed with a membrane. The document then gives astounding descriptions of extraterrestrial technology, recovered from crash sites from 1947 to 1953. This date range includes Roswell to Kingman. Metallurgical analyses show the materials were not known to terrestrial science at the time. The material showed incredible strength and extreme resistance in proportion to weight and size, appearing similar to aluminum foil or aluminum magnesium sheeting. Identical to the claims of primary Roswell witness Jesse Marcel Sr. down to the inclusion of inscriptions on material. In the press blackout section, we find information extremely pertinent to today's age. Media denial, discrediting witnesses, deceptive statements. There are countless examples I can discuss here, but I recommend watching my UFO stigma video and paying key attention to the Robertson panel and Condon committee, and also look at the reprisals against David Grush. Secure the area, removal and transport, and cleaning the area all detail systems and protocol for crash retrieval. What is of extreme interest here is the specific mention that any specific craft or device that appears to be functional is designated to red team. I can't help but think back to RA and how one piece of technology he observed at the off world technologies division was designated a weapon during recovery due to an energetic discharge. But I asked Mr. Wood if he had ever come across this red team before. I have to look, but I mean, I recall blue, blue fly and blue teams as well. I mean, I think the term red team and blue team are the same teams, so to speak, in crash retrievals. But, you know, right in the front description of the special operations manual, they have they mentioned these MJ 12 recovery teams. And I think in the, well, you know, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, they call it the blue lab. Now onto section 16. Special or unusual conditions has a very interesting note here. Should the need for public disclosure become necessary, the majestic team was to issue contingency plan mj-1949-04p-78. Remember this from the Eisenhower briefing document? We don't have the contingency plan. It's interesting that in the back of the special operations manual, there's a series of references in the back and they weren't supplied. That's the missing appendix too, right? Yeah, that's the missing appendix for references. I mean, it's in the back here. But for example, the photographic references were all correct, and you can go find them. So they're correctly referenced in the back. And then there's also the another sort of authenticity point is the UFOB, unidentified flying object, object identification guide that is listed in the manual, but was not supplied as photocopies, original photocopies, but other FOIA documents provided a typed version of it, not type set, but just typed. But when my father re-typed it all, following the format of the manual, it perfectly matched the page numbers in the table of contents and fit like a glove right in there. Section 17, extraterrestrial classification table is truly consequential for analyzing this document. Intact craft, damaged devices, identified and unidentified fragments and weapons were all to go to Area 51 S4. If you say Area 51 wasn't built in 1954, we'll discuss this shortly. Media, electronic recordings, maps, charts, etc. were to go to Kirtland Air Force Base Building 21. Supplies and provisions as well as deceased entities were to be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Blue Room. If Blue Room rings a bell besides Mr. Wood just commenting on it, remember in my UFO whistleblowers video, Senator Harry Goldwater was denied access to the contents of the Wright-Patterson Blue Room by General Curtis LeMay. I think the government does know. I can't back that up, but I think that at Wright-Patterson Field, if you could get into certain places, you'd find out what the Air Force and the government knows about UFOs. Reportedly, a spaceship landed and was all hushed up, quieted and nobody ever have never heard about much of it. I called Curtis LeMay and I said, General, I know we have a room at Wright-Patterson where you put all his secret stuff. Can I go in there? I've never heard him get mad, but he got mad at me, cussed me out, said don't ever ask me that question again. And speaking of General Curtis LeMay, and we have we have a accommodation from Curtis LeMay to Harry B. Cooper, which is the father of Tim Cooper, where many of these majestic documents came, and for his outstanding work at the USAF UFO program. So I mean, I can supply you that document. You can put it up on the screen. Let me see it. So that's another example of, you know, why in the world would Curtis LeMay sign accommodation for somebody for their USAF program? It just makes no sense that it's not totally real. I'm just trying to find a copy of it quickly. Yeah, I mean, it's it's hard to hard to read here. But, you know, this is this is their seal and accommodation. And it's to Harry B. Cooper, master sergeant, distinguished himself by Meritorious Service as a non-commissioned officer in charge of printing management branch and non-commissioned officer in charge of camera section, publishing division, command directorate of administration of services, headquarters, air defense command, int Air Force Base, Colorado from 30 September 57 to one June 63. So he was in air force base between 57 and 63 looking at photographs of UFOs and printing all sorts of classified documents. And, you know, I think it's Harry's relationship to this UFO topic and the friends that he made during that time that allowed those friends to decide that I want to give stuff to Harry's son, Tim Cooper, and several of the mailbox drops that had a lot of these documents from ostensibly the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Officer or Moondust Officer came from. Back to section 17, living entities were to be directed solely to OPNAC BBS 01. Of course, OPNAV, not OPNAC, stands for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. There are some who guess this acronym stands for the Oceanic Platform for the North Atlantic and Caribbean, and that BBS stands for the Bermuda Biological Station now called BIOS, the Bermuda Institute of Oceanic Sciences, but there's really no proof here. SOM101 continues with packaging and shipping protocols for EBE life and states, quote, loss of EBE life is acceptable, and also details in figure for the extraterrestrial craft referenced earlier in the document. Here we observe classic saucer and triangle shapes, but also the conical shape, which closely resembles the 1976 Tehran Iran UFO case and the Cash Landrum case. You know, in 54, now they have the triangle shape, they have the ice cream cone shape, they got the cigar shape, the typical saucer shape, but I draw your attention to the triangles and the ice cream cone, which is, you know, famous for the Cash Landrum case, and triangles are, this is some of the earliest mentions of flying triangles. But anyways, let's circle back to the document control page and analyze the initials, EWL and JRT. Inside the control page, which is typical of every highly classified document, this was apparently two points above top secret, according to the document, classifications are different now, and it's pretty much, I believe, an Air Force document. So, I went to the Albuquerque phone book, pulled it up for 1954, 55, 56, I mean, the entries in the change control page span from 54 to 57, I believe, and they had the initials. And so, I looked in the phone book and found all the initials, and there were two people that Jess R. Totten and Captain Lewis, I think, they both lived on Perimeter Road, like four or five houses from each other, inside Kirkland Air Force Base, at the right time. And then, that's in the authenticity discussions of, on the specialoperationsmanual.com website, it's in my book, and I'm working on a new updated pamphlet that will have the whole manual and all the authenticity discussion that people can read just easily. So, I found them, and then I hired a private investigator to go find them. And, well, I actually found one guy, one J.R.T., but he said, he's not the right guy, despite being there at the right time. And he was the one who lived on the street near kind of what you found from the phone book at the time near Kirkland, correct? Well, I didn't go to, so the process is really to go to the Adjutant General's listing in government document libraries to find their name and serial number, and when you get the serial number, you can get their National Personnel Record Center files, and then you can start digging around and try to find these people. And I found one J.R.T., which I thought was the right person, and went to his house. He took the meeting, I was surprised, and pulled out a FedEx envelope with this thing, you know, I'm sure he probably thought I was from the CIA or something, and opened it up, handed it to him, and said, is this you? And he looked at it for a while and looked at the initials and said, no, well, I asked him, well, what did you do at Kirkland Air Force Base? And that time, well, I was, I was sort of a psychological counselor or officer. I mean, you basically sort of hemmed and hawed about what he did. But nevertheless, the other private investigator found the kids of EWL, or the, I think it was the, I have to look at my notes, but wife or daughter, I think was the wife. And apparently he had passed away, was buried, I think he was buried in Florida. We have a grave marker. And we got platitudes. But, you know, what you hire private investigators, they're, they can do things that I just find very uncomfortable. They'll just lie to your face all the time. They'll lead you on. They'll, they'll, they'll squeeze information on all these methods that, you know, I just don't have the skills to do. And so I found that very interesting process. So we did our best to find that. But I would say the smoking gun there is that, yay, two initials are correct. And they were on the base perimeter road, you know, addresses. And that was just like, whoa, boy, that's a really good hallmark for authenticity that it was real. And, you know, I know you mentioned John Alexander in his comments. Maybe you want to set that up and I'll respond. Some of you may be familiar with Colonel John B. Alexander, a former U.S. Army Colonel whose name has been deeply entwined with ufology and government psionic programs like remote viewing. Not only has Alexander made some outward comments on the MJ12. Okay, we haven't got time to cover all that. MJ12 was real, had absolutely nothing to do with UFOs. And if you understand what it was designed for, it was the right kind of people, you don't have to make explanations as how certain people got in. But the people who did know, I mean, I was, in fact, what the thing was, at one time I had got rumors of the program. And it was one time that I went to Stubblebine and said, what about this thing? And he says, we're not going to discuss that. And it was a super, super secret and parts of it still are and need to stay that way. In his book, UFOs, Myths, Conspiracies and Reality, Alexander claimed Dr. Bob Wood told Alexander he believed the Psalm 101 manual to have been created in 1954 with the expressed intention to be leaked to Soviet spies as part of a disinformation campaign. The intent would be to get the Soviets to commit resources to UAP crash recoveries. Well, what does Ryan have to say? Yeah, I mean, I wish I knew what he's up to. I guess I've known John for many, many years. And so is my father. And he's always wanted to push the envelope and try to squeeze information out of people or trade information. So he has, I mean, he was in Vietnam, he was a special forces colonel operating in Cambodia illegally, you know, maybe on orders, maybe not. So he's had a long history of trying to skirt the edge of legitimacy, in my opinion. And, you know, why did he say this, that it's Russian Soviet, you know, spy craft? I think it was to curry favor with somebody else. Because it just makes no sense. I mean, there's why would you expose the fact that you've got alien technology that is going to write Patterson Air Force Base and Air 51S4 and you got bodies and parts and a whole retrieval program. And why do so much and then leak it? Why wouldn't you just, you know, you could put it with one of your assets in the Soviet Union and leak it in a much more responsible, less visible way. And so from a psychological warfare point of view, or PSYOP, it just, it doesn't work. It's like you're exposing too much information, there's no need to create such a fancy document with such high credibility to try to scare the Soviets. They have their own crashes. No ETs are real. I mean, or China, they they penetrated the Manhattan Project, you know, within a year to get the atomic bomb. And I'm sure that they were right on top of the whole, you know, UFO crash UFO thing. So it doesn't really make much sense in my mind. And the same thing is true with the entire swath of majestic documents. Is it why in the world would you try to do something over 19 years with so many documents of so many different different quality aspects? Some are really just photocopies, other original documents. So it just if you're trying to scare the living daylights out of some, you know, foreign intelligence agency, it's probably better to do something else. With all this talk of the Psalm 101, let's spend some time authenticating the document and spend some time analyzing arguments against the document. Now there is a witness, Navy Yeoman Dale Bailey, who alleges he saw the Psalm 101 manual when he was assisting in the destruction of classified UFO material for an admiral in 1976. Mr. Wood is currently in the process of locating files on this witness from his father's archive, so I may have some testimony from this individual soon. Within the words of the document, the woods have noticed many minute details that speak to the manual's authenticity. These include the mention of craft tape when discussing packaging NHI materials, not duct tape, which is accurate to 1954 shipping methods, as well as some spelling mechanisms, such as screwdriver being two words, which was customary in 1954, the capitalization of first aid, which was changed to lower case in the late fifties, the abbreviation of New Mexico as n.mex, not n.m, which was altered for zip codes, as well as the solo typo in the document in the word desiccant. And there is, of course, the point we touched on earlier, the raising of the letter Z, which indicated the usage of a hot lead press. Many detractors to the document like to point to the cover page and usage of variable fonts and drop shadow font, but we can find other Army field manuals from this time period using the same styling. Odd fonts had also been used in various documents, like this October 24, 1952 memo initiating the NSA under the Truman administration. Blocked epistemology has theorized the usage of fonts was actually experiments done by Dr. Vannevar Bush, who actually experimented with fonts, such as pictured here in a popular mechanics magazine, where we can see Bush operating a novel photo type setting machine out of EGNG in 1950. Bush even led the design of the cryptographic machinery used by the NSA's predecessor, OP20-G. Skeptics of the memo additionally like to point out a restricted classification on the memo's cover page and how the memo cannot be both top secret and restricted since restricted classification falls below confidential and top secret. This is a misunderstood point. According to the 1947 Atomic Energy Act, information on atomic energy is born classified, even if not created by USG elements. In situations such as these, restricted data is not a level of classification. A document containing restricted data can also be classified as secret or top secret. The Psalm 1 was also written during the time that the restricted classification level was phased out of USG to confidential. So we can find articles during this time about an extended changeover period due to some issues. Additionally, skeptics point out the fact that Area 51 S4, as highlighted in the classification table, did not exist in 1954. And this is a very important point to address. Yeah, well, and we found a newspaper article in 51 basically contractors are pissed off that there was this huge government contract awarded to a competitor for hundreds of millions of dollars for concrete out in Area 51. And they're fighting back and forth in the newspaper in 51. And the other thing is it was Groom Lake. There was a mine, the Groom Lake mine, which was a borax mine there already, that could have been exploited to be enhanced for an underground facility as well. That could still be researched further to find out from the mining department and the historical records. Well, how big was this underground borax mine? How many millions of square feet is it or was it? Where precisely is it? So you could dig further to provide further evidence there. But yeah, clearly, it was started in 51. And it's I'm sure started small. I strongly recommend reading Jan Aldrich's 1996 criticism of the Special Operations Manual. Aldrich's primary criticisms of the manual revolve around what it doesn't include, such as instructions to tell recovery teams to set up a grid, photograph the scene and tag each item for future reference. Aldrich also criticizes the use of downed satellites, which in 1954 was before the time of Sputnik. The use of the word satellite has been utilized commonly during this time period in literature to discuss space debris. I find much of his criticisms to be fluff, such as problems with interchanging the phrases MJ12, Magic 12, and Majestic 12 throughout the document, and can't help but to feel that Aldrich cherry picked his argument surrounding what is not instructed of the recovery teams. However, I do think his criticisms are important to understand when reading the document. If you want to read more, Ryan and Dr. Bob have a massive section on their website, specialoperationsmanual.com, authenticating the Psalm 101. I highly recommend reading this for a more of a deep dive into authenticating the manual. The article explores more into the provenance of the document, including analyzing the anonymous store in Wisconsin where the film was mailed. With all of this discussion around the Psalm 101, I found it important to touch on the legitimacy of other majestic documents, especially those that have been found in avenues such as the National Archives. Ryan had many more to reference. There was the Cutler Twining Memo. This is Bob Cutler, Robert Cutler to the National Security Council, and it says M.J.12 Special Studies Group in 1954. It doesn't say majestic, but it says M.J.12 Special Studies Group. It's the original Onion Skin. It's in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division in downtown Washington. There's other documents, too. There's one at College Park in Maryland from the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, which is part of Paperclip. This says C.I.A. M.J.12 on the bottom of a memo for Project Paperclip, Project 63, I think. Anyway, there's a couple of examples, and then there's acknowledgement, as I mentioned earlier, that the Interplanetary Phenomenon Union exists as well. It's not like there's no evidence from the National Archives, let alone all the other stuff, all the other UFOs, Project Sign, Project Grudge, and all that research. Of course, with Ross Colthart's new Reality Check program, interest in JFK and the majestic documents is at an all-time high, and I was super keen to explore this avenue. I think it's in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, one where they say that Kennedy was given some information or believed to have gotten information from somebody in Congress while he was before he was elected president. Kennedy was aware of it, according to the documents, of this topic and its importance. There's also National Security Action Memorandums from, like, a week before he's assassinated, where he says to James Webb, the head of NASA, I want you to share with the Russians the knowns and the unknowns. And by implication, that means, you know, open the kimono and tell the Soviets all about UFOs. And there's lots of reasons why Kennedy would be assassinated. But here's another one reason is that you might have told the truth or pushed harder on cooperation with the Soviets. I mean, particularly after his, you know, Bay of Pigs, you know, showdown, you didn't want that to happen again. The connection with JFK and MJ-12 does not stop here. Within the majestic documents lies a re-typed NSA intercept of JFK's hotline talking to the premier about the UFO situation and national security implications. JFK has also mentioned within another set of documents would consider to have the highest authenticity rating, the Burnt Memo. In June of 1999, UFO researcher Tim Cooper received an anonymous letter from a source claiming to be a CIA counterintelligence officer with documents that would connect MJ-12 to JFK's murder. The source commended Cooper on his decision to have worked with Dr. Bob on the majestic files. The files included by the source claim to have been some of the last surviving paper MJ-12 documents after a special classified executive order from Nixon ordered all MJ-12 documents to be destroyed and moved onto computers. The Burnt Memo was allegedly snatched from a fire before being destroyed and is unlike most documents original paper. This memo is from MJ-1, aka the director of central intelligence. The memo is directed to MJ's two through seven in reference to Project Majestic in Jehovah, Aviro, Parasite, and Parheleon. Quote, As you must know, Lancer, codeword for JFK, has made some inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow. End quote. We can also find a 1961 document allegedly sent by JFK to the director of the CIA requesting an update on the psychological warfare plans related to the Majestic-12. And here is a very interesting additional point. In 2023, President Biden ordered some documents from the JFK investigation be released. One name of note within these documents was CIA agent Reuben Efron, who was intercepting Lee Harvey Oswald months before his assassination. I do find it a bit strange, the October 15, 1955 Central Intelligence Bulletin listed operative Reuben Efron as well as three other USG or US military personnel as witnessing disc-like UFOs when traveling via train in the Caspian Sea. There are hundreds of majestic documents and the woods have implemented a really quality scale to gauge the authenticity of these documents. So of course, with so many documents from so many sources over so many years, I was encouraged to ask Mr. Wood if there were any documents he suspects are forgeries. Yeah, that's a good comment. At this point, I don't have any information that any document that's listed on the website is fake. I have no credible evidence that it's genuinely fake. I mean, so to fake something you have to have really, what's the specific, why did you fake it? Did you launch it against a specific target in intelligence? Are you trying to mess with the UFO community? Why bother? The general attitude of the intelligence community or the people that control this secret is to ignore everything and provide no additional confirmation or evidence. They just try to manage leaks and discredit people. So that's the methodology for managing leaks. So I would say at this time, I have no evidence that anything has been faked. Now, I've got lots of documents where you can't do anything more, like the Aquarius document that came out in the Carter, was allegedly signed by Carter. Yeah, I wanted to bring that up. That was brought forth by UFO researcher Lee Graham, the Aquarius document package. Can you talk about that and describe it a little bit along with kind of your feelings on it? Yeah, I mean, it's sort of fluff in my mind. I mean, it's informed fluff, but there's nothing to check. There's not enough specifics to validate or check anything. And it just seems odd that a document like this would be devoid of specifics. Maybe they wanted to ensure that there weren't any specifics that were checkable. But that's the part that's troubling and you can't check it. So you don't know what to do with it. So that's why it's in that Stan Friedman calls the gray basket or I call the neutral basket where I need more evidence to push it down or up. As we know, the majestic documents were leaked during the 1984 to 1999 era. This time was post Robertson panel and Condon committee where public interest in UFOs were at a relative low. Only behind the scenes in the 70s were researchers like Leonard Stringfield doing serious research on crash retrievals. With the majority of the documents dating back to the 40s and 50s, I asked Mr. Wood why he thought the leaks occurred when they did. But it was really about Vannevar Bush writing to Eisenhower saying, you know, we have all these celestial gifts of crash UFOs and we really ought to do something about it. And he said, be quiet, go win the war and come back to me later. And when Roswell happened, they actually pushed at it and started this organization. So who leaked it and why? Well, again, there's multiple sources and we don't really know, but we know that there was two film drops in 84 and 94. Those may have been the same people, but maybe not two different people. The certain method of delivery and undeveloped film was the same. And then there was several mailings from Sacramento, California. There was several mailbox drops. Some physically put in Tim Cooper's mailbox without postage. It's like somebody went into the mail room where it was a member of the post office and put it in his mailbox or cracked his code at the top and stuck it in. And then there was some mailings, for example, from the Freedom of Information Act office at Fort Meade, Maryland that became physically mailed, the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, which is original onion skin. And then there was a couple of different documents that were, they had this dash one and dash two in the upper corner on every page. And ultimately, Thomas Cantwheel wrote a letter at the time of his death or near the time of his death to Tim Cooper. It basically said, here, Tim, by the time you get this letter reaches you, I will left this world. So he's dying of cancer. And he goes on to describe his relationship with Stringfield and Friedman and intelligence contacts at Fort Meade, Maryland, Roswell, and then has a sketch of a craft that he sort of drew as the Roswell craft. And then we also had another letter from Salina, which is allegedly the daughter of Thomas Cantwell or Cantwheel, which is a pseudonym, you know, it's not his real name. So, but he worked allegedly at the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit and probably was an OSS officer in that time frame. And, you know, you don't know what he what he died of other than cancer. But so that's sort of the broad brush of the sources of materials. And there's so many names. I mean, on the majesticdocuments.com website, there's a you dig around, there's a personnel the master list right master personnel data list. And I urge everybody to file off your Freedom of Information Act requests to the CIA and the NSA and the Air Force and Air Force Office of Special Investigations and try to dig up more information and more FBI files on those those people and individuals or go to the National Archives. So there's loads of research to be done. It's just you got to pay people to do it. Right. This is a limited bandwidth. Everybody in ufology sort of has this, you know, peak of enthusiasm and then it wanes and then you sort of have the trough disillusionment and then if you keep going, you keep learning more. It's a complicated world. The mention of Cantwheel sometimes mistaken as Cantwell here gives us a great opportunity to analyze what we know about the majestic document leaks and their sources. There are three major sources of document leaks. One, Cantwheel, who supplied much of the material we've covered today to Tim Cooper, such as the IPU report and field order, Hill encoder magic memo, first annual report and the JFK to director of the CIA documents. Selena, the alleged daughter of Cantwheel supplied Cooper with 10 short memos alongside documents like the twining white hot report, Eisenhower to Oppenheimer memo and directive from twining to Truman. And lastly, we have source one who supplied the burn memo we spoke about earlier. In his letter to Cooper, Thomas Cantwheel took ownership for many of the mailbox majestic document drops starting in 1992. Timothy Cooper investigated Mr. Cantwheel and legally bound his findings in a five page affid David distributed to Stanton Friedman and Dr. Bob Wood that can be found on MajesticDocuments.com. Information obtained by Cooper and shared with Stanton and Bob include claims of Cantwheel's background. Cantwheel himself stated to be part of the quote counterintelligence core CIC scientific and technical branch interplanetary phenomenon unit from 1942 to 1958. According to Cantwell, he served in the CIC until 1980 and worked for CIA covert operations in the 60s and had contacts with the FBI, KGB and GRU. He claimed to have retired as Lieutenant Colonel and been involved with the majestic community, Majcom and the super secret 5412 group end quote. Well respected Reddit user Harry is white hot has spearheaded an investigation into identifying this mysterious Cantwheel so credit for his amazing work. Harry has proposed the idea for why CIA operative Boris Dmitry Tarasov is the man behind the enigmatic Thomas Cantwheel. Tarasov's CIA career spanned between 1956 and 1968 after immigrating to the US from Russia where his Russian language abilities proved invaluable to US intelligence agencies. His US Army records from the counterintelligence core range from 1942 to 1945 where Tarasov then left to the CIC to work for the Red Cross in Cleveland, Ohio. Harry wisely points out this Red Cross work likely is a cover story for work on the IPU stationed out of right field which is located in northern Ohio near Cleveland. Right field also house the army air material command where General Nathan Twining alleged majestic 12 member was stationed. It's worth mentioning during his time at the American National Red Cross Tarasov was employed for building maintenance engineering under a social agency. One must ask why a counterintelligence operator tasked with quote detailed composition of the foreign armies and their intelligence services approach and interrogation of the enemy military personnel and civilian detection and prevention of the acts of sabotage end quote would leave for a social agency four years into their career before rejoining the CIA. Interesting connection here as well in Cooper's description of Cantwheel he states while Cantwheel was part of the CIA and CIC he interrogated agents in West Germany. We can see on Tarasov's official record in 1945 the agent attended the advanced CIC school in Ober Erself Germany where he was tasked with quote extracting the necessary information from the enemy population military and members of the Nazi party end quote. In his analysis of Cantwheel Cooper also states Cantwheel served as US Army intelligence in Washington DC from 42 to 45. Well we can find Tarasov attended the Military Intelligence Training Center and performed CIC work at Camp Richie Maryland a mere 70 miles from DC in the year of 1945. At the time of Cooper sharing his investigation with Friedman and Wood he believed Cantwheel to be living in California and to be in his 90s. We can find no obituary for Tarasov but at the time of this personal history statement titled CIA historical review program released as sanitized released in 1998 just two years removed from Cooper's investigation. Tarasov was indeed living in San Leandro California born in 1908 this would have made Tarasov 88 at the time of Cooper's investigation if he was still alive when Cooper received his letter. This rabbit hole goes much deeper with Tarasov being stationed in 1963 as a translator operations officer in Mexico City transcribing and translating some agency surveillance traffic from communist aligned embassies and other specific targets. Tassarov's work was used as evidence to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald visited Soviet compounds so of course Tassarov's work dovetails into the JFK assassination. I personally have my own theory on the concentration of these documents as we see the information collected on the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time in the 40s and 50s. I draw your attention to the 1954 atomic energy agreement as mentioned in the 2024 and 2025 Schumer legislation which states NHI craft materials and bodies as well as UAP and legacy program information were hushed away as trans classified foreign nuclear materials. I find it interesting after the Psalm 101 which was released in 1954 most majestic documents dated after 54 contain nowhere near the detail on program operations scope and purpose. Perhaps the 54 AEC agreement oversaw a drastic shift in MJ12 records. I relayed this theory to Mr. Wood and he shared the same sentiment. That's absolutely true. I think that's when it it sort of happened and and that's maybe why we got the special operations manual is that you know the the Air Force officers that were responsible for this basically got the rug pulled out of them said no no you guys don't get to do this anymore it's going someplace else and people were pissed and this guy took it and decided at some point he was going to leak it. Mr. Wood and myself circled back to the personnel list I touched on earlier in the video with some of the original members named in the MJ12. I asked Mr. Wood about names associated with the Majestic 12 that have been overlooked or forgotten about. Yeah I mean it's in the white hot report it's mentioned that it was really forestall and bush that came together and said we need to form this top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization and I think it's also mentioned right there on the the front couple pages of the special operations manual the history of the group where it talks about special classified presidential order and James v. forestall and van of our bush you know formed the group or recommended to the president to do that. Now forestall you know he had a little bit of a drinking problem and he was very much of the attitude that we need to be more open and potentially discuss this with more people. I don't know if he was all the way to go public but he was thrown out the 75th well thrown out the top floor of Bethesda Mizz Naval Hospital or fell out the floor or something. He fenestrated as they say although I don't think it was windows it was you know bars but anyway he lost his life over that and and actually one of the majestic documents that says it's even necessary and regrettable that forestall had to lose his life and my book magic eyes only there's a dedication to those that have lost their lives for the sake of UFO secrecy and forestall is clearly one person that he lost his life for that sake of secrecy. So outside of bush and forestall are there any kind of names that you think as you were talking about how the majestic documents in the master list needs further investigation are there any names that you think are absolutely crucial to study and or have kind of been looked over and forgotten about? Yeah I think so there's the White Hot Report which is you know it's basically this is the group that went to Roswell and did a bunch of analysis and worked all over the summer to create this report in September. So it happened in July and this everybody went crazy and investigated and wrote up this report and presented it to the president and others and there's the members of the mission. You know there's people like Captain Charles Buchanan who the hell is he? I still haven't found him and what's his military personnel record file like or Robert Ginsberg, Colonel Robert Ginsberg or Captain Richard Glass or I mean Carl Hummelstein is a big well-known person. Major General Stephen Chamberlain assistant chief of staff for intelligence he was certainly a known you know major George McDonald that was his Chamberlain's boss. He was you know he was like the chief of staff for the Air Force. Admiral Paul Lee he's very well known. Leslie Groves head of the Manhattan Project he was he had all his team members there. James Lay Jr. Thomas Lynch which is the finance guy in the Treasury Department. So they had you know they got Navy and Air Force and finance people and as well as you know von Karman and Oppenheimer and Doolittle, James Doolittle and Professor Einstein. So there's loads and that's just one document where you could dig into the next level. You could write a whole book on just that one document and all the interconnections and the validations of every single sentence and every single linkage between people and their correspondence. It's a huge amount of work. I mean I'd love to give somebody here's 50 grand. I want you to go write a whole book on this one topic and go spend a year researching. And as I mentioned before we really do observe the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time. Myself and I'm sure every viewer of this video wonders about the evolution of the alleged group. How they operate today and if in 2024 there is still a group known as the Majestic 12. So the documents sort of in the history point of view are stop in the mid 50s or so with the fifth annual report on Majestic. And I suspect that it's probably still has the same name. It's such a rare club you know to lose that history and change the name seems silly but they could do it. And there's probably certainly a lot of subclassifications and different groups that are focused on hardware or bodies. Those are obvious bifurcations of classification. But then probably within each of those there's probably additional classifications to compartmentalize it and get into buckets where they could potentially work with private corporations or other organizations. But in my mind it's the aerospace corporation and the Carlisle group and EG&amp;G and some of them the historical ones I mean Rand for example was up to their eyeballs and this stuff. And there's probably a lot of them that have done research historically. We have heard so much from Ryan about his involvement with the Majestic 12 but another key player is his father Dr. Robert Wood. Why did Dr. Bob a rocket scientist get involved with UFOs in the Majestic documents? It was maybe 1967 or so 1967 where he started reading a bunch of UFO books and convinced his management that are we gonna figure out how the UFOs work before or after Lockheed does and they they said well how much money you want to try to work on that bomb. And so he spent internal R&amp;D Douglas aircraft company money and then then the merger happened to McDonald Douglas. But so for a couple years they spent the equivalent of four and a half million dollars working on gravity experiments theory. They interviewed abductees. I mean I remember as a you know a little boy you know 13-14 going out to the Mojave desert and one of his engineers was out there with a magnetometer and strip chart recorders and they had anomalous events and sleeping on this couch in this you know high heat in the desert and it was fun for for a kid at the time. So that was that was his work. They didn't have any access to classified information but that was the start of his deep interest in UFOs and actually he hired Stan Friedman to work for him and look at the nuclear physics aspect of UFO propulsion. Viewers of my channel will remember Project Moondust an official group proposed in 1961 by the U.S. Air Force alongside projects Blue Fly and UFO. Moondust was tasked to quote locate, recover and deliver descended foreign space vehicles and quote. Moondust counterpart Blue Fly served to quote facilitate expeditious delivery to foreign technology division of Moondust or other items of great technological intelligence interest and quote. In my video on Moondust we covered a variety of fascinating cases occurring in Nepal, Afghanistan, Canada and a 1965 case in the Congo with an accompanying memo titled fragment metal recovered in the Republic of the Congo. Origin believed to be an unidentified flying object. Moondust does indeed have connections to the majestic documents in a fascinating original document called the Bowen manuscript. Oh yeah I mean Moondust is definitely a recovery organization. I mean it's space junk primarily but occasionally it's you know down saucers and so if there's some obvious evidence that it's a saucer they may have a different team that goes but the Moondust people were very much involved um and so that's logical that they would do that. I guess I wanted to bring up one final thought for you is that many people say oh these are all photocopies uh and um and I guess I just wanted to highlight you know one of the leaked ones um well sent from Fort Meade from Freedom Information Act office was this one Top Secret Magic. This is original onion skin paper that we've done forensic analysis on and for ink and pencil marks and it has commenced by Vannevar Bush and it has hints of we have anti-gravity craft in you know 1960s. Uh the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers the the Bowen manuscript and actually there's a book that um it's on Amazon called the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers by Vernon Bowen who who wrote it and it's uh it's very well done history of UFO cases from 1960 and before so that's when he typed it sent it into the Air Force and never got it back until um 39 years later. Wow and the document has comments from Vannevar Bush. Yeah it's yeah it's like there's there's comments in marginalia and in pan and ink marks like you know what is Don Menzel doing question mark in relation to these comments in the topic and then uh another one was um in relation to could these craft be our man-made uh uh you know experimental vehicles and hand written on the side in ink is this should not get out uh implying in my mind that uh very of deep concern that we're got gravity control craft. Wow. And so that's uh that's juicy. My research and my father's research on the majestic documents is um rich and robust and highly supportive of their authenticity and credibility and I welcome objections to it and if if you have some it's fake because uh statement or I don't like it because I'm all ears but I've not found any credible objections. All right thank you so much Mr. Wood. Thank you. What's up guys thank you so much for joining me into this investigation and documentary on the majestic 12 and majestic documents. Before I get into my usual ramblings at the end of every video I need to say a couple things one thank you Mr. Ryan S. Wood thank you for sitting down with me doing this interview answering hours of questions and emails in the majestic documents the majestic 12 me requesting additional files me requesting images and so forth this man is truly of incredible character and I am so thankful one of my biggest inspirations in the field of ufology agreed to sit down with me and cover the majestic documents. For anybody who has watched a single one of my videos you know I reference this book magic eyes only as the greatest book I have ever read on UFO crash retrievals by Ryan S. Wood. I highly encourage anybody to purchase this book because it also covers much of the majestic 12 including the authenticating of the special operations manual. It also includes a full copy of the special operations manual. Third Ryan S. Wood has a beautiful tool I don't see referenced much this is a website called ufo decks ufo dex.com what this is Ryan S. Wood trained a chat GPT model and scanned in between 500 and 800 UFO books you can submit a question on any topic in ufology and receive an answer from Mr. Wood. I myself have used this tool dozens of times and I've used it in a lot of my past research such as referencing the 1974 koyame case discussing a certain private corporation I'm going to cover soon and I even asked it about underwater bases that NHI might inhabit after reading and hearing about some parts of Lou Elizondo's new statements. So thank you Mr. Wood please get a copy of magic eyes only please go to majesticdocuments.com where you can read all 33 or 35 of the reports I referenced today in depth of course with YouTube video descriptions it's a little too tough to include all links especially when I have between 50 and 60 research files so you'll look in the video description you will see every document we covered today which is over 30 you'll find the exact name go to majesticdocuments.com punch that in copy and paste it review the document while watching the video I think that's really important when we're discussing a document you can have it on another monitor I'm part of your screen kind of read through what we're going through you know me I like to cite my work so all of these documents will be available for you to read super easily okay onto my ramblings the majestic 12 has consumed my life for the past couple of weeks to the point where I have not even touched this and this is going to be my next reading I cannot wait to dive in but I highly recommend anybody get the majestic magic eyes only book and a book I referenced multiple times in the video top secret magic by Stanton Friedman if you want to learn more until the authentication of the Eisenhower briefing document Cutler 20 memo Truman forest all memo this is the book for you it was written in the 90s but this is a beautiful piece that's so useful to investigate more into what we've been talking about today Stanton Friedman is a legend amongst Ryan Wood Robert Wood so please check out this book if you want to learn more it's fantastic so now we can get onto some of my thoughts anybody who's watched my videos knows more and more over time I've been referencing the majestic documents a perfect example is my last video the 1974 koyame crash retrieval I referenced the first annual majestic report as well as the ipu report before that in my 1955 crash video near del Rio Texas I referenced the Eisenhower briefing document in the 1950 crash listed there also touched on by Lou Elizondo to have occurred near El Indio in Guerrero I made some statements public that I thought that the majestic 12 was likely a real organization and the majestic files had probably been a mix of information and disinformation at that time I had not spent the amount of time I have now pouring through the documents looking at connections looking at research and just immersing myself in so much time I think the majestic 12 encompasses so much more than what I initially suspected uh what really took me by surprise was the amount of length behind authenticating the Eisenhower briefing document and special operations manual those of course are two of the big heavy hitters we talk about this in this stock in this video but towards the end of the video you'll remember the bowen manuscript and you remember how the author bowen I can't remember his first name sent this into the Department of Defense in 1960 to get it reviewed he never got a copy back it wasn't until 1999 Timothy Cooper got this uh from a foyer designation Fort Mead with comments all over it from vanavar bush and stamp top secret magic now of course we discussed how this referenced moondust uh that vanavar bush made comments on uh anti-gravity vehicles but this the discussion of moondust and insect like beans reminded me so much of Dr. Sarbacher and of course I discussed that video Dr. Sarbacher multiple times but we have to remember that within the majestic files one if not the key player is Dr. vanavar bush of course the beginning of the majestic leaks occurred in 1980 but the thing is we can trace Dr. Robert Sarbacher discussing vanavar bush directing UFO study in the U.S. government as far back as 1950 around the time of the alleged mj-12 connection so I never thought the Sarbacher connections would go so deep here remember Dr. Sarbacher even when talking to uh Stanton Freeman namedrop Dr. Eric Walker Dr. Eric Walker himself confirmed to know of the mj-12's existence to say it's real along with a really interesting quote that reminded me of Don Quixote chasing at windmills perhaps what he meant by this is you might have the majestic documents because I believe this uh interview came out in the mid to late 80s Sweden have all the majestic documents I think that he may have meant you might have these majestic documents you may be able to read them but you will never get to the bottom of it it's futile to try and fully grasp the extent of the majestic files and speaking of Dr. Eric Walker what really interests me thinking about now is how his claims about a ESP getting into the program and so forth so that was just fascinating to me the connections with Sarbacher because remember Sarbacher described insect like beans as well in the encyclopedia flying saucers vanavar bush underlining these subjects is so fascinating and let's not forget at the end of the 14 page sample provided on majesticdocuments.com there's a section talking about Mussolini and Hitler uh being exposed to some sort of craft in 1942 vanavar bush underlines this as well almost underlines a whole paragraph this brings my mind back to the 1933 magenta italy case anybody else it's just it's really fascinating um some of the other documents that really interest me of course are the ipu report nine pages talks about the sandia lab technicians talks about the crew at roswell so much of these documents kind of focus around roswell right i think there's so much more work to be done on the jfk assassination in mj12 so much more work to be done on forestall's death in the mj12 because that's very interesting i think many people think of a conspiracy around forestall's death as well throwing himself out the 13th story of a of a naval hospital room so there's so much more work to be done there and there's so much more work to be done on the majestic documents in general right uh as mr wood has said much of these documents as he likes to say are onion skin where we have original copies in fact i'd say that's the minority of the reports many of them are facts from triax film uh photo copies and so forth so there's some provenance work that can't be done on these documents like mr wood has done with the bow and manuscript actually dating the ink back to 1962 of when vanavar bush wrote moondust on the the paper so i think if we look at the majestic 12 we can't argue for the validity of all of these documents but i think it is a safe line of research to kind of understand the majestic 12 likely was likely was and possibly is a real group tasked with the study material exploitation and reverse engineering and crash retrieval of ufo's how that looks today i would reckon it involves much more of a private sector uh as beautiful as it is with the sarbacher video we get to see a snapshot of the early days of ufo crash retrieval and i think the majestic documents are the perfect example of really investigating the early days the early players the early organization and the early procedures of ufo crash retrieval but anyway guys remember magic eyes only and top secret magic check them

There's two nomenclatures that we need to define in what your whistleblowers told you goes into his report. There's UAP and that's gray. We just don't know at this moment. But Alien Reproduction Vehicle, I can tell you, is very, very clearly a reference to a vehicle that has been constructed from non-human technology that is being operated presumably by either private aerospace or the United States government. A male staff member in Congressman Brown's office not only confirmed the exhibit, but the fact that there were three discs at that exhibit. These discs were hovering off the floor without any visible means of support. They were referred to as Alien Reproduction Vehicles. Also nicknamed the flux liner because they used high voltage electricity. This general got up and he was describing these vehicles. He described them as Alien Reproduction Vehicles, ARB for short. They also had a nickname for the aircraft. They called them flux liners. Now flux is an electrical term for a high electrical charge liner, a flux liner. Brad said that in this exhibit at Norton Air Force Base that a three-star general said that these vehicles were capable of doing light speed or better. In his groundbreaking article released in October of 2024, accomplished journalist Michael Schellenberger brought a new UAP whistleblower's testimony to the public zeitgeist. This whistleblower uncovered the shadowy Immaculate Constellation, an unacknowledged special access program that consolidates observations of UAP by both tasked and untasked collection platforms. The most groundbreaking aspect of this article to me was a single sentence mention of a term made famous by aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish. The report concludes that the existence of Immaculate Constellation demonstrates the extent capability to detect, quarantine and transfer, UAP and ARV. Alien Reproduction Vehicle collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the military intelligence enterprise. Many are familiar with the famous Alien Reproduction Vehicles, also known as flux liners described by McCandlish as relayed by Brad Sorensen, who allegedly witnessed these three saucer-shaped craft reverse engineered from non-human intelligence technology at a classified air show near Norton Air Force Base in 1988. But what is the full story behind ARV? What is the origin of this term? And what stories can we explore to try and support or discredit Schellenberger's whistleblower? Why the conspiracies around Mark McCandlish and his 2014 documentary filmmaker James Allen's mysterious deaths? What can we learn from a truly consequential, long-form interview primary witness Brad Sorensen gave in 1990, which I believe is the only time he ever spoke about the air show outside of conversations with McCandlish? And why did Brad Sorensen tell me that I was next if I investigated this story further? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so very much for joining me as we investigate and take a deep dive into the subject of Alien Reproduction Vehicles as relayed by Mark McCandlish. The concept of successfully reverse engineered UFO has perplexed me for many years and with the direct naming of ARV in the Immaculate Constellation article, I believe it is a perfect time to finally dive into this subject. Let us analyze the testimony of the now infamous Mark McCandlish and explore all avenues of the Alien Reproduction Vehicle. My name is Mark McCandlish and for the better part of the last 30 years I've been a conceptual artist, illustrator and designer, working predominantly for the aerospace and defense industries. About 1988 I came into some information that indicated that the United States government was in possession of and operating a kind of anti-gravity technology through a system, an aircraft that was referred to as the flux liner or as the alien reproduction vehicle. The late Mark McCandlish served as a highly decorated aerospace and aeronautical illustrator who devoted his talents to detailing sketches of advanced military and corporate projects. Mark's client list was astounding including the US Air Force, Rockwell International, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, as well as respected publications such as Aviation Week and Popular Science. Viewers of my channel may remember Mark for his appearance on Stephen Greer's 2001 National Press Club panel where he discussed the line art design of the alien reproduction vehicle aka flux liner. But few understand the full story and depth to which McCandlish explored these anomalous vehicles, a depth which very well may have seen Mark meet his demise. In the fall of 1988, McCandlish planned to attend an air show at Norton Air Force Base to network with military and government officials, as well as view new and innovative military aircraft with his good friend and fellow designer and inventor Brad Sorenson. A short time before the show on November 12, 1988, Mark regrettably dropped out to finish some lucrative design work for popular science and left Brad to attend the air show with a client of his. About a week after the show, Mark called his strangely absent friend, Brad, sounded off. On the phone, absent was his often animated personality. Brad told Mark he had seen something he probably shouldn't have. I think I saw something I wasn't supposed to see. And I said, how's that possible? Everything that's at the air show is sent there and flown there with the intent to bring it on static display, especially for the public. So how could you possibly see something that wasn't intended to be seen? He says, well, he says, I got him to see a display that was a little more exclusive. Here is what Brad told Mark. Brad ultimately attended the air show with one of his clients described as a tall white man with glasses, an Italian sounding name, wealthy and a former secretary of defense or under secretary of defense. Right around the time of the USAF Thunderbirds flyby at the air show, this individual issued Brad away from the main crowd. Mark initially assumed Brad and the man arrived to a hangar with four connected huts in the middle for this exhibit. But Brad would later disclose he, his client, amongst military personnel and dignitaries boarded a military version of the Boeing 727 and flew north of Norton to Palmdale Air Force Plant 42. Both military and civilian that got on a military version of the Boeing 727 and they flew from Norton Air Force Base up to Air Force Plant 42, which is in Palmdale. A lot of people just consider it the Palmdale Airport. It was actually a facility that was built from what I understand by Lockheed back in the 1960s. And the hangar that is now serving as a Skunk Works hangar was the original construction site for the L-1011 Lockheed tri-star airliner. Now remember Palmdale USAF Plant 42 as we will discuss this facility later. Among the personnel sent on the 727 according to Brad were the late California Senator Alan Cranston and Congressman George E. Brown Jr. who was at the time serving as the chairman of the Congressional Committee of Space Science and Advanced Technology. Possibly our most key individual here is Brad's client, the tall Italian man who passed Brad's office as aid to board the flight to the special exhibit. Brad seemingly never gave this man's name, or to protect Brad, McCandless never publicly confirmed this, but with high confidence Mark reasoned this individual was Frank Carlucci. The 16th US Secretary of Defense succeeded by Dick Cheney. Let's analyze Carlucci a little more. From 1992 to 2003 Carlucci served as chairman of the Carlisle Group, a private equity and asset management corporation with over $400 billion in assets. I highly suspect is deeply involved with UAP programs. Since its founding in 1987 under David Rubenstein, the Carlisle Group attracted myriad senior statesmen for advisors and board members including Carlucci, George H.W. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and former UK Prime Minister John Major. The Carlisle Group served as pioneer investors in defense and national security such as acquiring the electronics division of general dynamics, investing in Northrop Grumman and from 1999 to 2001 owned EG&amp;G, the same company deeply entwined in UFO lore from the testimony of Bob Lazar to serving as the parking lot hosting the Wilson Davis meeting. I would also like to draw your attention to Ronald Moultrie, former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and the Biden Administration. Along with his good friend Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, Moultrie served to spread disinformation by denying the existence of UAP at the 2022 UAP hearings. Moultrie, sometimes referred to as a gatekeeper of UAP programs, has some very strange ties to the Carlisle Group, such as serving as a board member in iCapital, a Carlisle-invested group and serving on the board of directors for the Better Angels funded by Carlisle's founder David Rubenstein. Carlisle Group is not the topic of our video today, but the ties here to Carlucci alongside his probable involvement in a classified airshow demonstrating ARV is of extreme interest. Walking into the Palmdale Hangar exhibit, Brad was told by his client, likely Carlucci, to keep his mouth shut and to not speak to anybody due to unexpected things at the show. The exhibit featured numerous high-tech aircraft including the losing model from the B-2 stealth bomber competition and advanced hovercraft that employed hidden thrust mechanisms. The show also had the infamous Lockheed Pulsar, aka the Aurora Craft. The Aurora, sometimes referred to as Astra, has often historically been associated with a triangular-shaped, possibly reverse-engineered craft. But in 1988, Brad relayed a much more grounded yet highly advanced design. The Lockheed Aurora was described as a large flattened-out football, all black and covered in tiles not too dissimilar to the Space Shuttle. Aurora featured a synthetic vision system utilizing infrared seeker heads. There was, at the exhibit, however, a secondary model featuring a canopy cockpit and two vertical stabilizers. Brad described this craft as employing two unusual propulsion systems, engines in the fuselage and external pulse detonation engines allowing the craft to fly 10,000 to 15,000 miles per hour. Markwood later state Tom Keaton from Lockheed Martin Calabasas Division confirmed the existence of the Aurora to him. Brad then described a massive black curtain separating the hangar into two distinct areas. Brad made his way to the second half of the exhibit. He's describing the different features. How do you know that? If you look at the outside of the vehicle, how do you know what the inner workings are? They had taken some of the panels off the outside so you could see the inside of what the corpus looked like. He said it was remarkably simple. There wasn't that much to it. You were able to figure out how it worked from that. He said, well, no, they had an easel next to it with a drawing, a cutaway drawing, that showed some of the internal components, how they were arranged and oriented to one another. And then they had a little TV monitor with a tape player below it that was showing this continuous loop of this thing sitting or hovering over a dry lake bed out in the desert somewhere. And as you would watch the tape, this thing would make, went from a hovering position, made these three little sort of hops going to the side. And then as the camera followed it, it just went straight up and disappeared outside. It was you down to nothing in just a matter of a second half or so. When meeting Mark for lunch the following week, Brad would sketch and discuss what he observed at this special exhibit. The exhibit was populated solely by top military brass and influential politicians and was guarded by men in berets with M16 rifles. Displayed were three flying saucers hovering off the ground ranging in diameter from 20 to 24 feet to 120 to 130 feet, but identical in scale. Brad described the craft to Mark as looking like they belonged in the 1950s, appearing like a jello mold on the bottom with sloping sides, a dome on top and a door that looked at home on a submarine. A three star general began to describe the vehicles to the attendees. The three saucers were called alien reproduction vehicles nicknamed flux liners. Each of the three craft had panels removed for attendees to view the craft's interior and alongside the speaker's podium sat an easel showing craft blueprints as well as a video player showing film demonstrating the ARV's capabilities. As Mark described, the film showed the ARV hovering over a dry lake bed before it would make three quick hops and jettison into the sky at astounding speeds. One of the things that this general had said during the presentation, one of the things that really stood out at Brad's mind was that he said that these vehicles were capable of light speed or better. Faster than light speeds is truly an astounding claim, so let's try and analyze the ARV in greater detail. Fortunately, as a designer himself, Brad would describe the flux liners in extensive detail to Mark, allowing the talented artist to make up high quality blueprints and line art of the craft. It is important to note the difference between the ARV and historical UAP testimony. In numerous UAP and UAP crash sightings, Crafter often described as rivetless, seamless with no visible means of propulsion. Often with a description of the vehicle looking 3D printed, this was night and day different to the ARV. Sorenson described the ARV as extremely worn, appearing to have been operating for decades. Chips were rampant in the lead paint coating of the craft, which seemed to serve to protect the crew from X-ray radiation, and the entire craft featured numerous smudges and fingerprints. Each of the three ARVs featured a crew compartment. The smallest design displayed four ejection seats attached to a vertical beam in the middle of the craft. The pilot utilized a strange ball control scheme to operate the craft which allocated power to various parts of the craft's propulsion mechanism we will talk about shortly. The ARV featured no windows for pilot visibility. Instead, each saucer dome was outfitted with an array of bumps housing optical camera equipment. This fitted the craft with a synthetic vision system. This synthetic vision system uses the same kind of technology as the gun slaving system they have in the Apache helicopter, except in this case you have two cameras. And it picks any pair of the cameras in that pattern of six that are around this circumference, including the one on the top. Whichever pair most closely matches the orientation of the pilot's head. So if he wants to look behind him, he can pick a view in that direction. The cameras slew in pairs and he has a little screen in front of his helmet and it gives him an alternating view. He has a little set of glasses that he wears. In fact, you can actually buy a 3D viewing system for your video camera now that does the same thing. What it does is it uses a beam splitter which sends part of light one way and part of it at a right angle and offsets it by about six inches. And then it has an electronic shutter in there that uses these like a liquid crystal type material that darkens and becomes transparent at intervals of about 60th of a second or 30th of a second. And so the cameras as they're looking around are giving him a right left right left view. And the goggles, the things that he's wearing, he has two little projection screens inside his helmet. And they both project, well two cameras, but one projection screen. And the glasses have that special blocking device that allows one eye to see and then the other eye to see. And at the same time, the cameras are projecting right view, left view, right view, left view, but they're doing it in like 30 frames a second. And so when he looks around, he has a perfect 3D view of the outside but no windows. The crew compartment or dome was completely separate from the propulsion system. And the propulsion system made no noise, featured no moving parts and output no gases or exhaust. Interestingly, Brad would state many of the craft's components including the crew jump seats and cameras seem similar to off shelf components and not highly specialized for the ARV. Radial oxygen tanks, presumably for crew atmosphere, sat atop an enormous capacitor array estimated by Mark to be roughly 14 inches thick. Curiously, a radial arm sat above the capacitor plates featuring the ability to extend outside the body of the craft. Mark theorized the purpose of this arm was for sample collection. Mark questioned Brad if due to the capacitor array, he thought this meant the craft function via the by-field brown effect which converts electrostatic energy into propulsion. To learn more about electro-gravitics and I feel like I've said this in the last five videos, I highly recommend watching Jesse Michael's video on T. Townsend-Brownt and please note, I recently theorized Edwards Air Force Base, which is very close to USAF Plant 42 and Norton, engages in the reverse engineering ARV testing program. Historically, Edwards placed very heavy importance in alternative propulsion methods such as the by-field brown effect. I highly recommend watching this video as over the course of this ARV exploration, we will further discuss ties to Edwards. Brad stated perhaps the by-field brown effect had some sort of application here, but the ARV were in fact utilizing energy drawn from quantum fluctuations, a.k.a. zero point energy. This again calls back to the witness Ed I covered in my video on reverse engineering at Edwards Air Force Base, who commented on the existence of zero point systems. There is a scientist in Utah by the name of Maury B. King. He's written a book called Tapping the Zero Point Energy and what he maintains is that this energy is embedded in space time all around us. It's in everything we see. I think it was, I don't know, it was a James Clerk Maxwell speculated that there's enough of this flux, this electrical charge in the nothingness of space that if you could capture all the energy that was embedded in just a cubic yard of space, that you'd have enough energy to boil the oceans of the entire world. That's how much energy is sitting there waiting to be tapped. Before we continue with Mark's investigation, let's take a moment to recognize Mark as Berlin's secondhand information up to now on ARV. Why should we take him at his word and do we have comment from Mr. Sorensen? Due to not having journalistic discretion, Mark historically regretted introducing Brad's full name into the story. And I had a colleague, a friend who I'll just call Brad for the sake of this discussion. Some people know what his last name is and I've tried to discontinue using his name principally because disclosing of his name has brought a lot of unwanted attention to him and his career. I don't know specifically what if any or how much harm has come to him in terms of his career because of my disclosures. I have to say that not being a journalist, not having a background in journalism, I didn't really know when I was being prodded by people in the disclosure project to name names and things like that, which I did. That, you know, this could be potentially and very harmful to the individuals who had been the original source of material. In the case of Brad, and another individual who had had occasion to see one of these things up close when he was actually in the service in 1973 at Edwards Air Force Base. There were a lot of details that were not only seen by these individuals, but were also explained to them, you know, basically to understand what they were looking at. Brad has been strangely radio silent on Mark in the story of ARV. Well, of course, I got in contact with Brad. Interactions with him from the get go were extremely hostile. I was told, quote, Mark McCandless was a stupid, dramatic, selfish fool who died because he could not keep his mouth shut. Learn from this, end quote. This statement is in relation to Mark's strange and controversial 2021 passing, allegedly resulting from a self-inflicted gunshot wound we will revisit later. But Brad's words directly imply Mark's words got him killed. Further interactions with Brad would lead to him saying I cannot cover this topic without facing mortal peril and to say goodbye to everyone I love if I continue to investigate Mark in the subject of ARV. I was even told I would never see it coming. My most interesting interaction with Brad stemmed from asking why Mark was allowed to talk openly about this topic for 20 years. I was told Brad protected Mark until he could not. We will discuss this further later. Hostile and silent, Brad has historically refused to comment on this case. But for this investigation, I have uncovered some documents I have never before seen discussed in the public domain. In December of 1990, two years after Mark and Brad met to discuss the flux liner, Mark relayed the contents of the restricted air show to William B. Scott, senior engineering editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology. Bill would feature some of Mark's sketches on the pulse detonation Aurora craft on the respected magazine and reach out to Brad for comment on the experimental aircraft and more strange craft. As some of the craft Mark described, matched eyewitness accounts relayed to the prestigious magazine over the years. Around this time, Brad went silent, even secluding himself to Mark, but not before Bill Scott was able to interview Brad on December 3, 1990. Let's dive into this interview I have never once before seen discussed. Brad stated he was not officially invited to the hangar in which the strange aircraft exhibit was stored. He was, as Mark stated, passed off as an aide for a gentleman who served within the Carter administration. Seen as Frank Carducci was deputy director of the CIA for Carter, he may still serve as a logical choice here. But why did Brad take this interview? Well, as he stated, quote, because I love America and the whole nine yards, but I'm also a Democrat and I don't think we need this type of spending on military equipment. It's just nuts. And that's what the whole meeting was for. Appropriations of billions of dollars to develop new craft, end quote. Very interesting statement. The 30 or so individuals present here were to be shown prototype and craft functionality to attract investors to these black budget projects. Brad described blue fatigued and suit clad men conducting the briefings at the special air show with exotic yet prosaic craft on display. Quote, Diff in each area, like a specialist in each area, some wearing suits, some wearing military, like Air Force, Colonel, Major, something like that. I did not see any stars in there, like generals of any sort. If there had, I would have noticed that end quote. Bill and Brad discussed some of the veto, vertical takeoff and landing craft at the show and the utilization of depleted uranium shells. Brad even noticed the V-22 Osprey was present, whose first official flight was conducted in 1989. The witness also confirmed the presence of California State Senator Alan Cranston. The rest of the crowd all appeared to be senior individuals, 45 to 60 years old. No support staff or aides surrounded what Brad referred to as the people. This section of the exhibit was likened to the hangar deck of an aircraft carrier with tightly packed craft. Most of the craft appeared to Brad as one-off prototypes. One of the enclosures featured the losing B-2 bomber prototypes just as Mark would later state. Brad also confirmed the unmanned, elongated, football-shaped Aurora craft that looked extremely similar to Mark's sketches but with a more tapered back. The craft was enormous, almost 100 to 110 feet in length. The dual propulsion system of the Aurora was also confirmed. Internal fuselage engines were utilized to get up into the air. Then pulse detonation engines were used to accelerate the craft to truly incredible speeds, 6 to 8 Mach, which is why the craft was unmanned. The present officials were extremely proud of the Aurora craft, stating quote, within an hour and 20 minutes they could take out every city over a million in the Soviet Union, end quote. Bill Scott asked if the Aurora was the most exotic thing on display. Brad responded with a resounding three nos. Brad would then state Mark's ARV drawing was so GD accurate, there was little he could further specify about the craft. When Brad first witnessed the alien reproduction vehicles, he was reminded of a nursery rhyme, labeling the craft Daddy, Mommy, and Baby Bear, as the craft seemed identically crafted to the same proportions but in different sizes. The smallest was roughly 20 feet in diameter, medium 60 feet and the largest 120 feet in diameter. Brad stated he thought the craft were very poorly built compared to the other craft on display, quote, they had been built by scientists who didn't know a hell of a lot about laying up composite materials or whatever, end quote. The crew compartment sphere appeared to have messy filaments for the sole purpose of holding in pressure. The entire craft was coated with a thick, heavy lead paint. Brad confirmed the ARVs were hovering, not connected to the floor. Brad was told the three craft didn't need a fuel source. They had found a new fuel source that was everywhere in the universe on the order of 500 times the speed of light, allowing the craft to travel five to eight times the speed of light. To dive into the gravity manipulation propulsion system, which Mark would later on discuss further, the craft was able to output 10 to the 26 power joules per cubic meter of space. Utilizing the synthetic vision system and pilot control ball, the vehicle was able to allocate power from the capacitor plates to travel to very different destinations, all with the ability to withstand 85 Gs of acceleration. The local area around the craft was not subject to inertial forces. Mark will expand on this later on. Curiously to Brad, the craft didn't feature food or long-term provisions, nor were any compasses or navigational charts present. Drawings, diagrams, and videotapes showed the craft flying in jerky, serrated, up-and-down patterns before jettisoning out of sight. The craft did not appear to involve normal aerodynamic principles. The exhibit attendees were told there were only three craft in existence. Quote, You can take this how you want to. We took all of it with a grain of salt. But the guy said that with this group of craft that, uh, they had been everywhere in the solar system, and there's no life, end quote. I must make a correction here, as initially Brad said no life in the universe, but he corrected this to mean solar system. The men running the ARV exhibit claimed they copied the concepts of the vehicle. Bill asked if the non-uniformed man answering audience questions discussed what the vehicles had been produced from. Quote, Well, they tried to avoid it. They said something about 1947. They had some sort of a contact, telling them that we had no right to use nuclear weapons, okay? That it was more disturbed than we knew. Cease and assist, end quote. Brad would then give, in my opinion, the most interesting statement of this entire interview. And all they really needed to do was give us the truth, and we would either take it or leave it. They just said that they had come across some hardware, tried to make contact with these. The others didn't want to make contact. They just wanted to deliver the news and leave, okay? But back in 1947, we had just won the war. We felt pretty damned cavalier, and we attacked, basically, okay? Rather than fighting back, they just tried to destroy all of their stuff and get away. And they didn't get all of it destroyed. That's what they said. Also said they couldn't really make those things that they found work. That they had to build their own. That this was built for our consumption, not theirs. Theirs was the wrong scale and the wrong, you know, whatever. Bill says, So we just looked at theirs and built our own. Brad responds, Uh-huh. Based on what was seen. So it was not like a great R&amp;D breakthrough. It was just copying something that they had seen to the best of their abilities. I need to take a moment to stress just how important this interview with Brad Sorensen and Bill Scott is. Quite often, you will see individuals criticize Mark McCandless's story because they claim he is relaying second-hand information. As we saw in this interview, which I have never seen once discussed before, Brad confirms not only the air show, not only the Aurora, not only the B2 losing competitor and the stealth bomber prototypes, but also the ARV craft as saucers with faster than light speed capabilities. This is massive to see this in Brad's own words. Why did Bill Scott and Aviation Week in Space Technology never publish this segment? Well, it makes sense as we saw in the document where Bill states that he had trouble believing some of the things Brad said because it had to do with flying saucers that were capable of light speed that were copied from other beans in technology dating back to 1947. Just wanted to take a minute to say that if you want to read the entire interview, I highly suggest it because I just did a summary here. The entire thing is quite mind-boggling. Back to the investigation. Was the ARV technology copied from the 1947 Roswell craft? The crudeness of the craft makes logical sense when in context scientists and engineers couldn't make the found anomalous craft work. The men spearheading the ARV program wished to build a fleet of these craft, but sought appropriate funding for it, hoping the Bush administration would be as enthusiastic as the Reagan administration about building up these reproduction vehicles. Never was it revealed who these vehicles belonged to or who these men reported to. Wow guys, so 11 years before Mark appeared on the disclosure project making the term ARV famous, Brad had actually confirmed the story all the way back in 1990. Included in these interview notes is a sketch of the exhibit which I believe was drawn by Sorensen's hand. Let's circle back to Mark and dive into his investigation around the ARV. After listening intently to Sorensen and analyzing the rough sketches of the ARVs, Brad drew on some legal paper. Mark got to work utilizing his legendary drawing skills to translate the ARV to traditional blueprint designs. Mark's work ultimately led to the now famous ARV flux liner cutaway drawing. One of the original blueprints of the alien reproduction vehicle which I produced in March of 1989, was put together by accumulating a lot of verbal testimony from Brad and later from a number of other sources including Kent Snowlin and some other people that I talked to who had some contact or information about the vehicle. In this clip we heard Mark mention alongside Sorensen his design was based on the testimony of others who had seen the craft. In 2001, McCandlish would feature in Stephen Greer's National Press Club conference with his explosive testimony as well as a Stephen Greer interview titled Blueprint for a UFO where he would expand on additional sightings of ARV. Later, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of Kent Snowlin that I met at an air show at Edwards Air Force Base in 1992, the first unveiling publicly of the B-2 bomber. He indicated to me that in 1973 when he was a crew chief working on experimental aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base that he had unintentionally wandered into an area where there was a classified aircraft, namely the ARV. He described it in detail and he added other details to the account concerning the configuration and the operations vehicle that Brad Sorensen was not aware of According to Selin, while working for the Air Intelligence Agency at Edwards North Base he witnessed the Fluxliner ARV in 1973 when cutting across the base to retrieve a ground power unit. Sightings of ARV at Edwards are possibly corroborated within the long-lost files of Leonard Stringfield. In crash retrievals of the third kind, fantastic CAD designer Michael Schrat gained access to the files of the late Stringfield in Mufon, Ohio. Here, Schrat would publish cases that had not made their way into the crash retrieval status reports 1-7. Leonard received information from a Class A witness who claimed to have witnessed a captured UFO at Edwards. This pilot was given permission to cut across the base in a USAF security vehicle when he stopped at a group of hangars to ask for directions. Within the open hangars, the witness observed a large disc-shaped craft with a clear transparent dome on the top. The witness was immediately told to vacate the area. The incident allegedly took place in the 1960s. Similar instances exist in the files of Stringfield such as the testimony of one Mr. Hines who relayed second-hand info from a source at Bell Labs. In the early 1950s, this source saw a UFO retrieval or test craft being brought into a California airbase. The source additionally saw a cutaway of the craft. The fantastic 2014 documentary we've been pulling clips from titled Zero Point, The Story of Mark McCandless and the Fluxliner explores an additional witness who claimed to have knowledge of the ARV, one Lieutenant Colonel John Williams. Williams' 2000 testimony also features briefly in Stephen Greer's fantastic disclosure briefing document. Williams served as an electrical engineer in charge of construction projects for military air command at Norton from 1981 to 1982. The Lieutenant Colonel stated he knew of a facility within Norton Air Force Base that was so secretive not even the base's wing commander was allowed access. Rumors circulated the base facility housed a UFO. Very little more than rumors here in Williams' story, however, even the implication of a craft near Norton is worthy to analyze. Mark's pursuit of tracking down other witnesses of ARV was relentless. In 2001, on the Disclosure Project conference panel, Mark would display two original photographs obtained from USAF Captain Harvey Williams, who photographed a disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah. Mark would state the images accurately depict the ARV craft up to the synthetic vision systems on the crew component of the craft. Mark utilized these photographs to highlight how the synthetic vision system may have changed from 1967 to 1988. As mentioned before, many components of the 1988 ARV as relayed by Brad utilized off-shelf components, including the synthetic vision systems and surrounding acrylic bubble. Mark reasoned due to cameras being much larger in 1967, the vision system bubbles would need to be much larger as well to accommodate these devices. Interesting to analyze this possible ARV evolution. Later on, I obtained photographs that were taken in 1967 by military pilot Harvey Williams flying a C-47 for the Air Force at 12,000 feet approximately 25 miles southwest of Provo, Utah. This particular vehicle matches the so-called ARV in all proportions and respects in terms of the detail of the shape of the craft. I would like to quickly highlight Provo, Utah is under 100 miles from Dugway Proving Grounds, a location I have covered previously. Witness MS claimed to have observed a hovering craft at the Dugway Aviary Building and also knew of a DUM, a deep underground military base engaging in UAP programs under Dugway's main facility. From 1988 to his passing in 2021, Mark's insatiable curiosity would lead him to devoting much of his life to discovering how the ARV functioned. He would draw parallels to possible Nazi flying saucer technology and the Glock, patents filed by associates of T. Townsend Brown, and even technology possibly discovered by the great Nikola Tesla. Mark's research led him to hypothesize an elegantly simple yet crude design. The ARV system, for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities, was indeed remarkably simple. It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia, with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought. You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy, or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes. In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off. The most complicated aspect of the ARV to Mark seemed to be the pilot's control system. The sphere itself appears to be a kind of a domed arrangement where you have a number of fiber optic leaves that come into the sphere. And for each one of the 48 capacitor arrays, there's a series of sensors that are then used to sort of relay information to the individual plates. And so then, on the bottom of this, you have a bowl that moves around and can be used to convey the commands of the pilot in terms of what he wants to do in terms of shaping the field around the vehicle. And right in the center of that bowl is a kind of laser diode that sends a laser beam up into the underside, the inside of the sphere. And so as the bowl moves, that laser is sort of scanning around on the inside of the different sensors that are responsible for each of the capacitor sections. Then there's a series of relays that will open up and close and let a certain amount of energy in or prevent it from going in. And when it's dead center, it means that all of them get the exact same amount of information. You just go straight up. If you want to bank to the right, then you bank this to the right. It sends the laser signal over to the opposite side of the dome. And it says that the opposite side of the craft is going to get more energy, so it banks in that direction. It's kind of like in a helicopter, in the swash plate of a helicopter, when you want to bank to the left, you create more deflection in the main rotor on the right side so that it begins to bank to the left. It's kind of the same principle. Mark theorized the craft operated in space-time similar to an Alcubierre drive, a system that compresses space-time ahead of a craft and stretches space-time behind a craft. The area between these two vectors creates a localized space-time, reducing inertial effects and mitigating G-forces for the craft. The Alcubierre drive allows for a faster-than-light travel system, however. The validity of this drive has been debated endlessly, and I simply do not have the physics capabilities to contribute to this argument. This mitigation of G-forces and inertial dampening seems to be present in numerous historical UAP sightings where instantaneous acceleration is observed. Perhaps a localized space-time pocket is indeed possible with NHI and ARV craft, and I'd like to leave you with some words by former Northrop Grumman deputy CTO and colonel of Army Futures Command, Carl Nell. The second point is faster-than-light travel. Everybody says faster-than-light travel is not possible. This is false. Miguel Alcubierre, a postgraduate student at the University of Mexico in 1994, solved Einstein's equations for an effective faster-than-light mechanism. NASA has investigated this. Everyone accepts his solution as valid. These performance characteristics draw my attention to estimating flight characteristics of anomalous, unidentified aerial vehicles by Professor Kevin Knuth. In this paper, PhD Professor Knuth estimated the G-forces experienced by the Tic Tac craft in Commander David Fraver's 2004 sighting. G-forces experienced by this craft when it dropped from a high altitude to sea level were estimated to reach in excess of 5,500 Gs, for reference. Our best ballistic missiles can experience but a fraction of these G-forces before ripping themselves to shreds. Mark's research would ultimately lead to a 2015 lecture at the secret space program titled The Feasibility of Interstellar Travel. The summary of this discussion states, quote, how back-engineered off-world technology created powerful leverage for corporations to take over control of world government, establish an internationally manned secret space program, and break away civilization, end quote. Even though first-hand witness Brad Sorensen stated the enigmatic men showing off the ARV claim the craft had explored our solar system, this is a very charged statement by Mark. Oftentimes, the phrase secret space program is associated with unexplained claims and outright bizarre stories. So let's instead analyze the claims of Gary McKinnon and Edgar Fausch in relation to a secret space program. I have spoken about USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch myriad times, most recently analyzing his claims of encountering full anti-gravity propulsion systems for a secret space fleet while working for the proposed Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979. Fausch claimed triangular-shaped craft titled TR-3B leveraged reverse-engineer technology to provide logistics and transportation to a secret space fleet. Construction of these craft are allegedly a joint effort by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Teledyne, and the project is managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA. Fausch's testimony is extremely impactful for me due to stating pilots of the TR-3B craft are few and far between. These elite pilots are plucked from the Edwards 412th Test Group Test Pilot School. I recently did a whole investigation into this subject and with high confidence in this project's validity, I explored a joint research project between Edwards Air Force Base and Nellis Air Force Base focused on testing reverse-engineered craft and technology of non-human origin. This project I explored employs contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, SKIMS funds off the F-35 fighter program, operates over restricted airspace such as the Nevada Test and Training Range, and employs the Edwards 412th Test Pilot School and Electronics Warfare Group. Have no fears that TR-3B will get a full exploration of its own, but context around Mark's discussion on a secret space program is extremely valuable here. Additionally, remember if you will, US Army Green Beret RA, who witnessed the off-world technologies division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana. RA stated in an interview to me while performing operations on Nellis and nearby DOE-owned land, he was witnessed to triangular-shaped craft operating off electro-gravitic propulsion. In 2002, British hacker Gary McKinnon was arrested for hacking into US Army and NASA computer systems. McKinnon claimed amongst mundane files was an image housed in the NASA Johnson Space Center featuring a cigar-shaped object stationed in near-Earth orbit. McKinnon also claimed to have found a document on a NASA server titled Non-Terrestrial Officers containing names and ranks of USAF personnel. Amongst these documents were tabs for material transfer between ships. This already draws parallels to Foush's TR-3B logistics and personnel carrier ships. So maybe this idea of a black-budget hidden space program isn't so fantastical. Let's see what Mark has to say in this discussion. I want to talk to you about a few of the different vehicles that I believe are being used in the secret space program or have been used in the secret space program. Craft listed here are of course the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle as well as the first-generation Aurora constructed by Lockheed and a triangular-shaped craft out of Lockheed Skunkworks that allegedly served as the target for a 1989 Germany crash retrieval operation. The candlest detailed how his first suspicions of highly classified black-budget aircraft programs arose when he met two Lockheed Skunkworks personnel who commissioned Mark to illustrate a pitch to DoD for a new jet with extreme speed capabilities. Mark compared components of scramjet technology to create what he thought was an extremely eye-catching design. Meeting with these Skunkworks personnel, they grew furious with Mark, accidentally letting it slip aircraft components would tear apart during Mach 17 speeds or 13,000 miles per hour. And remember, this was before Lockheed became Lockheed Martin, so this incident occurred even before the Sorenson ARV incident. For reference, the world's fastest jet, the unmanned NASA X-43, reaches a top speed of Mach 9.6 or 7,366 miles per hour. And the world's fastest man jet, the SR-71 Blackbird, reached solely Mach 3.3 or 2,193 miles per hour. Mark moved on to discuss in great detail Sorenson's ARV experience in 1988. Not a ton of new information here we haven't already covered. Mark did touch on the interesting point that Brad and most likely Frank Carlucci flew a short flight to Palmdale Air Force Plant 42 to view this special exhibit. As they were going into the hangar, the gentleman turns to my friend and says, he just realized that there are some aircraft on exhibit here that you're not cleared for security-wise. You are not cleared to see these aircraft, so just enjoy the show, walk around, listen, take a look, but don't say anything to anybody. So he goes in, I don't know how well you can see this because it came out kind of light, but there were two sections to this particular hangar on the inside. I would like to add Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale is less than 30 miles southwest of Edwards Air Force Base. The site features a sizable Northrop Grumman facility as well as Lockheed Martin hangars and the home of the infamous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Division. The claim these ARVs were shown at Plant 42 very near Edwards matches very closely with my previous thesis of a joint reverse engineering program out of Edwards. Now, Witness Ed stated he worked on joint programs with Lockheed Martin and Boeing, yet historically Northrop has been additionally implicated in the construction of the TR-3B Black MantaCraft and an anti-gravity disc known as the Great Pumpkin developed at Northrop Grumman Advanced Concepts and Technologies Division, Palmdale, California. Hang tight guys because our next project will cover US aerospace craft allegedly built with NHI technology, especially because there are numerous claims of joint developed reverse engineered craft from Lockheed Skunk Works and Northrop Grumman. All of these deviations from Mark's story are to say I find the continued parallels between the alien reproduction vehicle and the 412th reverse engineering group at Edwards and Nellis quite tangible as well as the addition of Northrop Grumman to the core contractors engaging in ARV. Mark leveraged his understanding of physics to discuss how the ARV craft possibly generated three different electromagnetic fields. One created by the primary windings of the Tesla coil, one created by the windings in the center, and finally one created by a low temperature plasma fired through the center. And guys, I say this all the time, physics really isn't my strong suit so please watch the lecture for a better understanding. So in the process, what I really think that I've sort of stumbled across is a way in which this system here has three different electromagnetic fields. It has the one created by the primary windings of the Tesla coil. It has the windings in the center that also creates their electromagnetic field. But then when that plasma ring, or I should say it's actually a sort of a low temperature plasma like phenomenon or a virtual plasma, it fires down through the center and it also creates its own set of electromagnetic field lines. And so what happens is you have an effect, it's very similar to, you've heard of the electromagnetic pulse that occurs when a nuclear bomb goes off. Well they actually have a weapons called the explosively pumped electromagnetic pulse weapon. And it does the same thing and what it does is it just combines overlapping electromagnetic field lines and then using explosives, it pinches all, oops, sorry, it pinches all those magnetic field lines and it creates a powerful pulse. And so what I'm suggesting to you is that process is actually forms a kind of a doorway for tapping into this zero point energy. Now why is that significant? Why does that mean anything? Well part of the reason is that this device, when it taps into zero point energy, they've shown that zero point energy is actually responsible for the effect of gravity, for inertia and for mass. And so if you're pulling some of that energy out of the environment, it may be, even though there's an infinite amount, I mean some of the latest figures are 10 to the 109th power joules per cubic centimeter. That's one of the latest figures I've seen. That's a monstrous amount of energy. That's enough energy that if you took all of the energy that's in this amount of space time and were able to tap it, it would be able to boil off the oceans of the entire planet. So you can see how this technology makes a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker. That's probably one of the reasons why there's such a tremendous effort to suppress it because in the wrong hands obviously it could be weaponized, it'd be very dangerous. Now for example, Einstein said you can never travel faster than speed of light because as you accelerate through space time, your interaction with the zero point energy that's embedded in space time raises your mass. And so it makes it harder and harder for you to go faster and faster so you can never really reach the speed of light. In fact he said if you could, that as you approach the speed of light, that your mass would become near infinite. So imagine then that you're actually using the free energy of zero point energy. You're tapping that as your propulsive force. You're using it in the environment. So there's a couple things that might happen when you do this. One is that it reduces the mass of your vehicle because you're using this stuff that would otherwise create to its increase. And you're using that to do work. You're using it as a propulsive force. So under that theory, under that theory you could actually be able to accelerate up to and beyond the speed of light because the very energy that would be ordinarily slowing you down by raising your mass is actually what you're using to push you along. I do find it very interesting since 1975 Los Alamos National Labs was conducting extensive research into these explosive magnetic flux compression generators. Mark would then highlight a Polaroid image taken north of Cedarville, California in the spring of 1984, which he purported may be one of the only photographs in existence of a string of vehicles used in this secret space program. Mark even illustrated the craft based on the eyewitnesses testimony. Now under a loop looking at the original Polaroid, you can actually see a little bit more detail. This was a drawing done by the eyewitnesses of fellow who took the photograph. And there were some things about it that I could probably go into, but the thing that's important to remember is that some of the features look remarkably like some of the structure on the so-called alien reproduction vehicle. And in fact, it did it seem apparent to him that these wingtips, if you want to call them that, could actually rotate inward so that this thing would actually become more of a triangular shape, which also, of course, would help with issues like storage. Now this is a little bit more detailed drawing than I did based on what I could see through the loop. Near the end of the presentation, Mark circled back to the May 1989 East Germany crash recovery of a Lockheed Martin advanced aerospace vehicle. This craft recovery is claimed to have been executed by special forces, ringing parallels to the numerous claims of JSOC units involved in foreign and domestic UAP crash retrieval operations. Mark likened this craft to the F-117A stealth fighter utilizing stealth technologies. The most interesting component of this craft were the three spheres on the underside of the craft appearing to be made of a white superconducting ceramic material. The crash of this vehicle allegedly broke off the tail section, dislodging one of these spheres. The pilot involved with the crash told Mark the retrieval team was ordered not to touch the sparking sphere with bare hands. Mark theorized these spheres utilized some sort of cryogenic fluid to harness zero point energy systems, meaning the craft may have employed ARB systems. When I finally did get around to making a copy of this original drawing in the form of Blueprint, I sent a copy to Brad. And one of the first things that he said to me on the phone was, and he wasn't kidding when he said this, he said, you know, Mark, he says this drawing is about as accurate as you can get. He says every detail, every aspect of it is right on the money. He said it is so accurate in every way. He says this has to be probably one of the most dangerous illustrations you've ever done in your life. And he says if you're smart, he says you'll tear up the original, you'll throw it away, and you'll never talk about it again. After Mark appeared on the 2001 disclosure project speaking openly to the world about the alien reproduction vehicle, he got the strange feeling his activities were being monitored. Mark was called and warned to stop doing what he was doing and one by one he lost all of his defense clients. Mark reasoned he understood why some corporations and individuals may not have wanted to be associated with somebody speaking about flying saucers. Further attacks would see Mark threatened on the phone and his money and cars taken by the IRS. Mark would carry a heavy feeling of guilt and regret including Brad Sorensen's name, stating he was almost coerced by Dr. Greer not to protect names. I mean, there's many times I lay awake at night with my 9mm under my pillow, he loaded, and I wonder why they haven't killed me. And I honestly do. As we discussed earlier, I have played many clips from the fantastic documentary Zero Point The Story of Mark McCandless and The Fluxliner by the late filmmaker James Allen. This documentary discusses strange deaths of free energy pioneers such as fundamental physicist Stefan Marinov who fell out of a window in 1997. Cold fusion researcher Eugene Malove who was beaten to death in 2004. Zero Point Field Investor Arie de Goose who was found dead in his car in 2007. And Star Drive inventor Mark Tomion who died unexpectedly in 2009 after a successful demonstration of his prototype. The best example here is the case of Amy Eskridge which I may save for a future full investigation. Dr. Amy Eskridge was a 35 year old scientist and co-founder of the Institute for Exotic Science in Huntsville, Alabama. In 2022, Amy died in what was ruled a self-inflicted instance. However, an incredible amount of controversy surrounds her passing. Leading up to her death, Amy had been lecturing on behalf of Holocron Engineering, a gravity modification R&amp;D company, discussing historical anti-gravity experiments and modern black projects associated with developing the anti-gravity TR-3B craft. Again, we'll save this for another time. Mark admitted he had no idea what the ARV and these technologies were used for, but he did state clandestine military operations may stop at nothing. To prevent these technologies from leaking to the public and foreign adversaries, and housing these programs alongside defense contractors would strengthen classification of programs utilizing these systems. And these strange deaths very well may include James Hallen of the 2014 documentary. The details around his death are highly suspicious. This is the young man who produced the film that you'll probably have a chance to see later on, James Allen. He's passed away now. And this was literally just a month before the film was released. And he suddenly became very sick. He was in the hospital. He died within two and a half months. And the manner of his illness was so peculiar and so strange. We decided to go have some pathology done. And what we found, it's really hard to see on this chart because it's so small. I wish I could blow it up somehow. But basically, all of these little things here we see and age next to those levels right there, those are all radioisotopes like uranium, thorium, beryllium, cadmium, things that you would not find naturally occurring. So it seems apparent to us that he was poisoned using radioisotopes. And so I would like to dedicate this presentation to the memory of my friend James Allen. He's a brilliant young man, had a great potential as a filmmaker ahead of him. And I thank him for the time that he dedicated to documenting what I did. On April 13, 2021, at the age of 69, Mark was found dead in his home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. That day of April 13, Mark had spoken to his friend Rick Price and told him he would call him later. Mark additionally spoke to his girlfriend and told her he would speak to her when he arrived to work at her animal shelter. According to Robert D. Morningstar, Mark was supposed to testify to elements of the Senate on UAP in June of 2021 and had been in contact with Senator Rubio. Was Mark's death truly his choice? I am reminded of what Brad told me when I asked about Mark's death. Quote, Mark McCandlish was a stupid, dramatic, selfish fool who died because he could not keep his mouth shut. Learn from this, end quote. Why was Mark allowed to investigate and speak on the ARV from 1988 to 2021? Was testifying to the Senate, possibly including Rubio and the gang of eight, the final straw? I am again reminded of Brad's words, quote. I protected him until I could not, end quote. Hey guys, I know we ended on a very somber tone, so I would just like to take a moment to dedicate this video to the memory of James Allen and Mark McCandlish. Without Mark's work and James Allen's work, none of this would have been possible. I'd also highly recommend watching the 2004 documentary, Zero Point, and the story of the Fluxliner, as well as Stephen Greer's 2001 NPC and the interview with Mark titled Blueprint for a UFO. If you didn't notice earlier, I would also highly recommend reading the 1990 interview with Bill Scott, the Senior Engineer of Aviation Week in Space Technology, and Brad Sorenson. Now, after that massive investigation, what do you guys think? I personally find the story of the ARV one of if the not most interesting stories in all of whatever you want to call it, ufology. Even before the Schellenberger article with immaculate constellation and the mention of ARV, there was something about the McCandlish story that always stuck out to me. The level of detail with which he described the Fluxliner as relayed by Brad. And now after finding this interview with Brad, some of these small intricacies that Mark would say, this is how Brad acted, you know, usually he was very animated and quite, you know, lively. And then in the interview with Bill Scott, we see, you know, Brad using foul language and being very descriptive. I took special note of him kind of making fun of the designers of the ARV craft, saying clearly this was made by scientists, you know, Brad as an industrial designer and Mark as a designer. They carry a certain swagger with their designs, sleek, beautiful, you know, especially Brad as coming from a car designer background, him just making fun of these scientists, saying it was clearly made by them. Clearly made by them. Now, I think the most shocking part of Brad's testimony in the 1990 interview is the statement of how these individuals in charge of the ARV got their hands on the craft. Copy the technology couldn't figure out how it worked from somewhere in 1947 with others with beings that tried to take their technology off the board for humans. It wasn't meant for us. This harkens back to many stories in ufology about the Roswell craft, about humans getting their hands on technology forcefully and stories in the private sector about companies and scientists, not necessarily knowing how exactly these craft function. And thus we get a poor man's copy in the ARV. You know, we have these off shelf components, the synthetic vision system, the jump seat, the radial oxygen tanks. It's quite interesting. I also found it quite puzzling how Brad says he doesn't know who these craft belong to or what exactly they're for and report to. You know, part of me thinks they wondering about the secret space program, the craft as Mark decided or described as possibly taking samples. If for these kind of black budget operations, which may function in sort of a closed loop, you know, there are stories of these places, these places, facilities, programs operating in cash transactions and utilizing analog computers to completely stay off the books. You know, one would must think how do these programs get their hands on materials, raw materials, metals, composite materials, you know, rare earth elements, lithium. You know, this begs the question, what if these ARV craft? What if one of their primary responsibilities is to, you know, visit the asteroid belt or near earth objects and kind of retrieve metals, precious metals for these programs to operate and continue their research and continue their development? I'm just spitballing here. Of course, the reality is probably much stranger, especially when we factor in stories to Edgar Foush and the TR3B for troop transport and logistics. You know, does this secret space program have some sort of station across our solar system? I also want to remove this secret space program away from sort of the more Corey Good 20 and back type stories. Of course, some of these claims are quite fantastical, especially with Corey Good, the 20 and back story, which is essentially a story of indentured servitude to work side alongside extraterrestrials and humans in a space program. Corey Good, the manufacturer of the story actually detailed these lies under oath. So let's separate from those and we can take a much more grounded analysis to the secret space program. Part of it may be for nuclear superiority in the secret space program talk. Mark talked that the Aurora craft was actually a part of this program and the Aurora, you know, may have its place in this program due to the nuclear strike capabilities as Brad described. And they could destroy any city in the Soviet Union with a population over one million in under two hours. So how interesting is this, the combination of Mark McCandless's ARV with the entire testimony of Brad. Now that we have words from Brad's mouth, you know, forget the guys of death threats towards me telling me that to say goodbye to everybody I love, which to be quite honest, I wouldn't get too hard on Brad about this. I think if anything, he's just probably trying to ward off amateur investigators off this case because there is a real and present danger here. But being able to look at the story through Brad's words, you know, I can only think of two differences between Brad's and Mark's stories. One of these in the secret space program talk, Mark spoke that the craft wasn't made of too much metal that most of it was composite materials. In the interview with Brad, he mentioned that a lot, a lot of metal was used. So this may have just been something that evolved over time, you know, maybe Brad thought the filaments on the crew compartment and composite materials were in fact metal and so forth. Also, Brad stated in the interview, there wasn't many stars, so general ships there, but this was in relation to the first interview with some of the terrestrial craft. He didn't actually specify if the generals were were present for the ARV demonstration, that interview, which Mark said the three star general was demonstrating the flight capabilities on the videotape. So yeah, guys, we have the full story of ARV and this is just one facet of ARV. We also have the full TR3B investigation dating back to Edgar Foush to go down. And then we have a whole array of vehicles purported to be using NHI technology to some extent from artificial intelligence to full components and propulsion systems. And I think there's a total of 10 to 15 of these alleged craft, of course, three of them being the flux liner, the Aurora craft and the mind skipping a blank here, the TR3B. But we have plenty more to investigate with ARV. This isn't just McCandlish, but this story was made famous by McCandlish. So when Schellenberger mentions the story of ARV in the whistleblower report, I immediately think of these crude, jello saucers with jaggedy flight dynamics. That can travel faster than light speeds. Now, this is a very serious topic, guys. I don't want to draw any attention to Mark's grieving family. And of course, James Allen's presumably still grieving family, but it was worth kind of highlighting the strangeness around these passings, especially Mark possibly being, you know, set to testify in June of 2021 before congressional and Senate elements. It begs the question. Did Brad's protection of Mark, in whatever capacity and whatever facet that was, run out when Mark decided to testify before Congress? Was it all fine and dandy for him to be running around with Greer and saying these things in documentaries and having fun, but as soon as it came time for him to be subpoenaed or to swear this under testimony that that was enough? I don't know, but so much respect to Mark. What a beautiful soul. During these past couple weeks, I've got to watch dozens, if not 50 plus hours of Mark speaking, and he truly was a great loss to humanity. What a beautiful artist. What a beautiful, eloquent person. And thank you, James Allen again for making such a beautiful documentary. With this episode, guys, I hope you enjoyed it. This was one of my favorite investigations ever to create. And with that being said, please remember to like and subscribe. I have a Patreon. I don't gatekeep any content there. Only support what you think the channel is worth. And guys, I will catch everybody on the next show. Oh, wait, real fast. I do plan to attend the November 13th hearings and the Soul Foundation, so I should have live coverage from those boots on the ground. But anyways, guys, with that being said, thank you so much for joining and I will catch you all in the next show.

I've been studying UFOs. Did you know there are UFOs out here flying around? Unidentified UFOs. This would be the place for them, Southern California. It could be aliens, it could be balloons, or it could be alien balloons. President Obama says that there is footage and records of objects in the skies. He's asked these unidentified aerial phenomenon and he says we don't know exactly what they are. What do you think that it is? I would ask him again. Thank you. The reality of the unidentified aerial or submerged phenomena is not up for debate. It is fact there are anomalous signatures that operate in our skies, oceans, and near-Earth orbit that exhibit strange and astounding characteristics including instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity, anti-gravity, low observability, and transmedial travel. Whether you recognize the phenomena as non-human in origin, or believe that these signatures are advanced hidden human technology, or any combination of these is up to you in all of these warrant future investigation. But no matter what you believe, you cannot deny the UFO study is looked at with ridicule, disdain, laughter, and has historically been treated as a joke. But where did this UFO stigma come from and why is studying anomalous signatures on this planet looked at as silly? Why have civilian and military pilots historically been advised not to share UFO sightings, fearing revocation of their flight status? Why is serious scientific investigation into UFOs laughed at as seen as a fruitless venture? There are three things about this whole thing, Tom, that no one can deny. There are incontrovertible points, even the grossest skeptic can't deny. The first of all is that the UFO reports not only exist but persist. When I started with the Air Force, I thought that this was a fad and a few years would just disappear. And it's global, we have reports now from 140 countries, practically as many countries as there are in the United Nations, and the most important of these three things is that many, unfortunately not all, but many of the reports come from highly, highly credible, technically trained people, you see. I am UAP Curb, guys, and today I wanted to do a review on the history of the UFO stigma and highlight how this narrative of UFO being nothing more than misidentified prosaic phenomena and only studied by tin foil conspiracies and whack jobs, has in fact been pushed and perpetrated by our own United States government. We could realistically start with the 1946 Kenneth Arnold saucer sightings or the Roswell crash of 1947, but you know me, let's start where our paper trail leads us. So let's take a peek at the first official USG program, Investigating UFOs. Project Sign began in 1948 and ran until 1949. United States Air Force General Nathan Twinning established this project, initially naming Sign Project Saucer due to Lieutenant General Twinning's assertion that flying discs are, quote, real and not visionary or fictitious, as seen in this letter to AAF commanding General George Shlugen. The written sign report states that some UFO reports present actual objects, but origins are undeterminable. Edward J. Ruppelt, future director of Project Blue Book and Grudge, claimed Sign endorsed the interplanetary explanation for some of the unexplained signed sightings. If you know UAP Gerb, you know any official United States government UFO investigation can be traced to the DOE or parents, the AEC, the Atomic Energy Commission. Well, get this, all sign reports were required to be sent to the Army and Navy Research and Development Board, the USAF Scientific Advisory Group and the Atomic Energy Commission. The program was shut down in 1949 by General Hoyt Vandenberg for, quote, lack of proof, but the next official investigation into UFOs was commissioned the exact same year. Project Grudge ran throughout 1949 when it was officially terminated, but Grudge records were updated up until 1999, featuring a full published report in 1960. Reviewing the Grudge report is not the topic of this video, but seen as it is 707 pages of case analysis, maybe I'll do a most interesting cases on Grudge reports video someday. Anyways, USAF formed this program specifically intending to alleviate public anxiety over UFOs. Here we can see the first real breadcrumbs of the USG trying to alter public perception of UFOs. Grudge was tasked to explain sightings away as balloons, conventional aircraft, optical illusions, planets, mass hallucinations, etc., such as in the case of the Lubbock lights, where four engineering slash STEM professors in Lubbock, Texas, witnessed multiple flights of 20 to 30 lights traveling at incredible speeds in a perfect semi-circle formation. Grudge infers and marks this case down to a flock of migrating birds, even though this explanation is unsubstantiated and not shared by the professor witnesses. J. Allen Heineck, the future Blue Book scientific advisor, stated that Project Grudge was, quote, less science and more of a public relations campaign. In my association with Project Blue Book, I know very well that it was not a scientific project. I also know that they never, never would notify the media when an interesting case came up. They did everything they could to keep it down, so they definitely withheld information. You know, when I first interviewed Allen years ago, there was a theory going around that anybody who saw a flying saucer was probably be followed by swamp gas somewhere in Louisiana and didn't know what he or she was seeing. We've had a lot of documentation since that time. I think one of the main things that has come out here that Peter has done is to substantiate the credibility of many of the civilians. Now, Project Blue Book ran from 1952 to 1969 and is where the true UFO stigma was born. Blue Book, of course, is the most well-known USG official UFO study and was founded to determine if UFOs were in fact a threat to national security and to scientifically analyze UFO data. Fun fact, from 1952 to 1969, Blue Book analyzed 12,618 UFO reports, 701 of which were classified as unexplained after extensive analysis. I've talked at length before about how J. Allen Heineck stated Blue Book was essentially a disinformation project and a distraction tool used to cover up and gloss over the UFO issue. We won't tread on Heineck too much, but who was Heineck? Astrophysicist Dr. J. Allen Heineck served as the public advisor and scientific advisor to Project Blue Book and lives in infamy for self-admittedly participating in the UFO cover-up. During the tenure of Project Blue Book, Heineck's dissatisfaction for the ridicule and planned debunking of credible UFO reports was a, quote, open secret, but the doctors spoke openly about this after leaving Blue Book. If you think back to the classic misexplanations of swamp gas and weather balloons, Heineck was one of the key individuals who pushed to deliver these hypotheses on a national stage. But how did Project Blue Book do this and how did they warp the entire American public perception on UFOs? In December of 1952, one of the most famous mass UFO sightings in American history occurred over Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. Over a series of nights, a group of lights accompanied with radar signatures appeared over Washington, D.C. Many reported physical craft were seen, including the pilots of a B-52 bomber, and at the time serious consideration was put towards this case being the craft of E.T. Origin. This event often referred to as the Invasion of Washington, where the Washington National Airport sightings took the nation by storm, leading to 148 national newspapers covering the event in the following six-month period. What followed captivated our country even more? On July of 1952, USAF Major General John Sanford, USAF Director of Intelligence, and USAF Director of Operations Roger M. Ramey, yes, the same General Ramey that ordered Jesse Marcell to pose with fake wreckage to curb the Roswell crash, held a press conference at the Pentagon. During the conference, Sanford explains the way the bulk of UFO reports, quote, to their own satisfaction as hoaxes, erroneously identified friendly aircraft as meteorological or electric phenomena, or as light aberration. However, he goes on to quote, There have been a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things. Sanford then referenced the DC incident by saying that in no way were the sightings related to any secret development by any department of the United States. But in 1953, the USG and CIA walked back and flipped Sanford's statements on their head by forming the Robertson Panel. Under the guise of mass panic and to alter public reaction to UFOs as stated by Dr. Heineck himself, physicist and CIA consultant Howard P. Robertson was directed to review all Air Force case files on UFOs from Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book. Oh, and by the way, at this same time behind the scenes, the Tell Memorial Institute, who has a storied connection to UFO, especially material analysis around the 50s, was commissioned to separately review all Air Force case files. Anyways, the panel met for a series of four formal meetings and conducted such riveting analysis as reviewing 23 of 2,331 provided USAF UFO cases on record, watching two films of UFOs and comparing them to seagulls, discussing the problems inherent to monitoring UFO sightings, and finally meeting with USAF Major Dewey J. Fornette. Fornette spoke to the panel that for a year he had coordinated UFO affairs for the Pentagon and supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis for some unexplained cases. The panel spent the rest of that fourth day discussing that meeting. The Robertson panel concluded that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status, and suggest to the public that there is no legitimate evidence of their existence. However, signatory to the report Thornton L. Page admits on the 3rd of October in 1993 that the chairman told members ahead of the meeting to debunk all UFO reports presented to them, and to, quote, reduce public concern. And what's also really important to note is that the Robertson panel was held a month after USAF Colonel Donald L. Bauer forbade Captain Edward J. Ruppelt from visiting the CIA Office of Special Investigations to share information on compelling UFO data. So what we can derive here is the Robertson's panel's conclusions were predetermined in order to devalue UFOs and attribute them to nonsense and misidentified prosaic phenomena. In fact, Dr. Heineck quotes that the panel was handed down the unwritten law of the Air Force. Don't rock the boat, play it cool, and don't get the public excited. What is awfully curious here is that after UFOs had been publicly denounced, the subsequent year, 1953, USAF issues Regulation 200-2. This piece restricts UFO reporting procedures and supersedes the former AFL 200-5. This means all confirmed UFO reports were to be sent to the Air Force Intelligence and not Blue Book. This included reports by USAF personnel, and this keeps credible sightings from both Congress and the American people. On the 5th of April 1966, Congress held its first closed session on UFOs in a hearing by the House Armed Services Committee. Former President and at the time Congressman Gerald Ford noted the ridicule he received for arranging the hearings, quote, as I expected some persons have ridiculed my call for a congressional investigation into unidentified flying objects. Part of Ford's reasoning for calling for the hearings was dissatisfaction in Heineck's explanations of UFOs as swamp gas or weather balloons, particularly the 1966 Dexter, Michigan mass UFO citing Heineck devalued as swamp gas. On the panels had Blue Book head from 63 to 69, USAF Major Hector Quintanilla, J. Allen Heineck, and Secretary of the Air Force Harold D. Brown. On this panel, Quintanilla tells the House Armed Services Committee that Project Blue Book had, quote, no radar cases that are unexplained, explaining the vast majority of radar detections away as temperature inversions or just misidentified phenomena. This was an irrefutable lie seen as Blue Book reports show numerous radar unknowns alongside corroborating witness testimony. This lie was later pointed out by Dr. Heineck himself who pointed out several anomalous radar detections that stumped Blue Book including 1951 Goose Bay, 1956, Lake and Heath, and 1957 Shrevaport. Due to his dissatisfaction as being used as a, quote, puppet of the Air Force, who, quote, only says what the Air Force wants me to say, Heineck prepared a surprise statement for the hearings requesting the USAF commission a civilian panel of physical and social scientists to examine the UFO problem critically for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem exists. Both Heineck and physicist James E. McDonald requested but were denied a seat on this panel. Instead, in the summer of 1966 physicist Edward Condon of the University of Colorado Boulder, my rival university, so I don't like them, was selected. Condon was well known amongst the scientific community for his tenacious work on the House Un-American Activities Committee and a suitable candidate for the job. And I'm sure the modest sum of $313,000 for a year's work didn't hurt. Condon received multiple requests to brief the committee by retired USMC Major Donald Keyhoe, ARPO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, NICAP, McDonald, and Heineck, all of whom agreed to share any and all research files on UFOs. Condon declined many of these offers. The committee moved very slowly, hampered by the apparent lack of funds and methodology. Lacking subject matter expertise, and strangely enough, committee members usually worked without coordination with one another. In late 1967, Condon stated in a public lecture he thought the government should not study UFOs because the subject matter was nonsense, adding, quote, but I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year. This is a very strange statement seen as, in this time, Condon has been contracted to investigate UFOs, not have a conclusion. In 1967, the aforementioned James E. McDonald made public a 1966 memo written by the Condon Committee's second-in-command, Robert J. Lowe, who wrote to two University of Colorado admins that they could expect the study to demonstrate that UFO observations had no basis in reality. Conclusions before findings. This trick memo was written by Lowe, who was a hardened skeptic heading into the committee, and the paper trail does in fact exist that he served in the CIA before teaching at CU Boulder. Quote, the trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study, but to the scientific community would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer. One way to do this would be to stress investigation, not the physical phenomena, but rather of the people who do the observing, the psychology and sociology of persons and groups who report seen UFOs. If the emphasis were put here, rather than on examination of the old question of the physical reality of the saucer, I think the scientific community would quickly get the message. This trick, by the alleged CIA asset and second in command to the Condon Committee, Robert Lowe, perfectly details the UFO stigma and how it would operate moving forward. Forget the citing, no matter how credible, question the psychology of the observer. The final nails in the coffin of serious UFO study would be hammered in by the release of the Condon Report and subsequent Condon Report review by the National Academy of Sciences. The Condon Report released as a book, both hardcover and soft, to be consumed by the public. In his conclusions and recommendations, Condon stated, quote, Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record, as it is available to us, leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby. He recommends that the Air Force and USG at large shut down and prohibit any investigation into UFOs. The report seemingly does away with the scientific method to explain all cases away as conventional or natural explanations. James E. McDonald calls the report inadequate and said, quote, It represents an examination of only a tiny fraction of the most puzzling UFO reports of the past two decades and that its level of scientific argument is wholly unsatisfactory. Both McDonald and Heineck publicly stated that the committee ignored key evidence and could not explain 25 to 30% of the cases examined. Because the Condon committee was unable to explain one quarter of the cases that were submitted that they studied. I'm curious, and I think everyone is now thinking the obvious question. How did they handle that in their report, the ones they couldn't explain? Well, very nicely and very adroitly, I use the word. Dr. Condon wrote this summary and completely neglected the contents of the report. The report received almost universal praise from the news media, with many magazines, journals and newspapers publishing approving reviews or positive editorials of the Condon report. Some of these compared any continued belief in UFOs to those who believe the earth is flat or believe in ghosts and Bigfoot or other supernatural or unsubstantiated phenomena. Others predicted that the interest in UFOs would die in a few generations and only be dimly remembered as a candle flick in the darkness. Science, the official publication of the American Association for Advancement of Science said, quote, the Colorado study is unquestionably the most thorough and sophisticated investigation of the nebulous UFO phenomena ever conducted. In 1969, the National Academy of Sciences wrote a review of the committee, citing Condon's work as sound, approving of his methodology, and agreeing in his assertions that there should be no more formal investigation into UFO. In 1970, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics made official statements agreeing with Condon's suggestion Little of value had been uncovered by scientific UFO studies. UFOs were now lumped in the same boat as ghosts, Bigfoot and other fringe topics or conspiracy, a subject to be scoffed and laughed at instead of disgust and studied. UFO was now synonymous with tinfoil hat conspiracists instead of the accredited physicists like Heineck and McDonald who wished for nothing more than to study UFO. Sine, Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel and the Condon Committee were all guised as serious investigation into UFOs, truly used to publicly discredit the phenomena while real research went on behind the scenes. All of these tools culminated in 1969 so the USG could say, quote, UFOs do not exist and we do not study them. However, of course we know that this is not true and this stigma was created for the purposeful distraction to take eyes off the UFO study. There are times in your life where you have been worried to speak to a certain person or people's about UFO or judge somebody because they've brought up UFO or thought, maybe I shouldn't talk about this. It's no secret the UFO phenomena has a massive stigma around it associated with conspiracy, with whack jobs, with ghosts and Bigfoot. And as we've seen in this video, that's very real and very planned. The sophisticated disinformation campaigns Grudge talks about here is those in effect. Project Sine, Project Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, the Condon Committee, all of these have been used as tools to ridicule the study of anomalous things in our skies. It's absurd, absolutely absurd, all under the guise of scientific research. I hope you learned something today. I certainly did. Making this video, there was a ton of research to go into it. I got to read the whole Grudge and Blue Book reports, a ton of interesting cases I want to cover. But I will put every case I can in the video description. Many of them I have are PDFs. So if you'd like to get them all yourself, please email me at uapgerb.com or join my Discord in the description. I will actually have a channel for all of the case files. But did I miss anything in this video? Or anything else I should have covered? How did you beat the UFO stigma in your personal life? How did you overcome this woo and begin talking about it freely? I know that I overcame this stigma from very early on when I pieced together that hey, UFOs are being studied by the United States government both publicly and in the shadows. So why are they being shamed? It's fascinating and unfortunately this stigma has been wildly successful. So thank you guys, I appreciate you joining me. Please remember to like and subscribe. I will catch everybody on the next UAP Gerb Show.
