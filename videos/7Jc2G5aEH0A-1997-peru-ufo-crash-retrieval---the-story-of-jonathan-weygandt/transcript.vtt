WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
It was dripping this syrup like, like service custody is liquid.

00:05.760 --> 00:10.560
It was everywhere, all down everywhere when we went down there because there was plants and everything.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.160
It was, it was weird.

00:12.160 --> 00:19.040
It was a purplish green color and you could tell it was like, it was just weird.

00:19.040 --> 00:29.840
It was, it's hard to explain it kind of like, like, like it was like it seemed to just like be alive.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.680
I mean, it was almost like, if you're looking like something organic, I don't know, I couldn't tell.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.120
It didn't look like anything we would make, like machine parts or anything.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.280
It looked like it was sculpted.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.960
These were these large vents.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.000
They looked like they went into the craft, but I couldn't tell.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.080
But it, I mean, it was a shadow.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.160
That was the only thing that really cast a shadow.

00:50.160 --> 00:58.720
The rest of this, well, it was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow where you could see where there wasn't light.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.400
But the sun was shining right on the object and it didn't cast a shadow.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.520
Not on anything.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.360
It was like kind of like absorbing the light.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.960
It was weird, strange.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.280
There was no reflection or anything like that, you know.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.760
Is there anything positive at all that you've got now?

01:13.760 --> 01:16.640
Yeah, I'm still alive.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.800
Yeah, they threw me into the mud and all that liquid got my hair in my face.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.280
Oh, they were like scientists, I suppose.

01:23.280 --> 01:29.040
They had this typo, like we'd call it mop gear, right?

01:29.040 --> 01:30.720
Mission-oriented protective posture.

01:30.720 --> 01:37.200
And they had gas masks on and like rubber suits and they were coming around.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.440
And you had all kinds of weird people there.

01:39.440 --> 01:46.560
Some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on and personal protective gear.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.240
And it was all different ones, different kinds.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.280
Very few first-hand UFO witness encounters over the decades have matched the intrigue,

01:57.280 --> 02:02.080
coherence, and respect as former US Marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.360
Lance Corporal Wagan first told of his harrowing UFO crash retrieval encounter during official

02:07.360 --> 02:13.680
service in US Operation Laser Strike in the Peruvian jungle through Stephen Greer in the year 2000.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.640
As a young perimeter security marine tasked to investigate a downed aircraft thought to be a

02:18.640 --> 02:23.600
South American drug smuggling plane or friendly US vehicle, the Lance Corporal claimed to have

02:23.600 --> 02:29.440
stumbled upon a crashed, egg-shaped UFO and subsequent Department of Energy retrieval team

02:29.440 --> 02:35.520
that in my opinion gives us one of the greatest possible instances of insight into how US government

02:35.520 --> 02:38.800
rapid reaction UFO recovery teams operate.

02:38.800 --> 02:44.080
Since his original testimony, Wagan has publicly discussed his encounter with a non-human craft,

02:44.080 --> 02:47.920
an antagonistic DOE retrieval team only once more.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.400
In 2023, Jonathan Wagan appeared on a podcast with Martin Willis,

02:52.400 --> 02:57.200
re-addressing aspects of the Lance Corporal's incredible encounter but exploring little new

02:57.200 --> 03:04.720
ground. Today, I am beyond excited to announce a true successor to Jonathan Wagan's 2000 testimony,

03:04.720 --> 03:09.280
an in-person discussion where Jonathan and myself discuss why he went public,

03:09.280 --> 03:15.200
new details of the UFO crash retrieval encounter, adverse health effects and reprisals Jonathan has

03:15.200 --> 03:21.120
faced and so much more. Before this discussion, I thought it pertinent to take a step back and

03:21.120 --> 03:27.520
cover Wagan's testimony in painstaking details. After all, I have covered this case before in

03:27.520 --> 03:32.480
one of my first ever projects but barely even scratched the surface of this encounter.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.280
So before I sit down with Wagan in the coming weeks, let's take a step back and analyze

03:37.280 --> 03:43.200
every single detail of this 1997 encounter, from piecing together the origins and deployment of

03:43.200 --> 03:48.640
the DOE recovery team to contacting other Marines allegedly involved with the case,

03:48.640 --> 03:54.240
to determining where Wagan may have been taken and interrogated to analyzing specific similar

03:54.240 --> 04:00.320
egg-shaped UFO crash retrievals. Let us leave no stone unturned analyzing one of the most

04:00.320 --> 04:04.640
fascinating first-hand UFO crash retrieval cases in history.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.680
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we embark on a

04:09.680 --> 04:15.200
comprehensive analysis of the claims of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan. As a precursor to my

04:15.200 --> 04:20.160
in-person interview with Jonathan, I thought it pertinent to step back and critically analyze

04:20.160 --> 04:26.000
the entirety of his testimony. This investigation will not seek to simply retell this incredible

04:26.000 --> 04:33.200
UFO crash case but to unravel this case and gain insights into US UFO crash retrieval teams.

04:33.200 --> 04:39.120
And before we get started a few things to point out, I would like to thank RGHUFOs and take OM

04:39.120 --> 04:44.880
for their incredible 2023 work into Wagan's case. These excellent researchers arrived at many

04:44.880 --> 04:49.680
of the same conclusions I did long before this project so please check out their work in the

04:49.680 --> 04:55.440
video description. I'll also be pulling clips from Wagan's 2023 podcast with Martin Willis

04:55.440 --> 05:01.360
and 2000 tape testimony with Steven Greer. And it is worthy to note, Greer chopped up Wagan's

05:01.360 --> 05:06.800
original testimony, emitting certain details. These include Wagan describing what looked to be

05:06.800 --> 05:12.640
a four-fingered arm hanging out of a recessed hall in the crashed UFO. Greer seemingly omitted

05:12.640 --> 05:17.920
this from the 2000 testimony. Due to this, I will be pulling Wagan's recorded tapes off

05:17.920 --> 05:24.000
of Steven Greer's DPI archive to try and capture Wagan's words uncut and in their purest form.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.120
But these files are still chopped up and edited. I have found it impossible to get my hands on

05:29.120 --> 05:35.200
the full unedited tape but this is the closest we can get. Due to these rough files, audio quality

05:35.200 --> 05:39.200
is significantly worse than the published interview but I still find it important to

05:39.200 --> 05:44.720
publish Wagan's words without edits. These source files contain many additional details,

05:44.720 --> 05:49.760
time spent with Wagan's military records and drawings, as well as questions asked by filmmaker

05:49.760 --> 05:54.080
James Foxx that were curiously cut out of the 2000 published interview.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.040
This one was the one that was half open and you could see into it but I mean it was just

05:59.040 --> 06:06.560
black as like looking into a closet. Alongside the 2000 tape, I have found and will be often

06:06.560 --> 06:12.160
referencing Jonathan's outreach to Greer's team from August 2000, just two months before his tape

06:12.160 --> 06:17.680
testimony. And of course it goes without saying, I will often be pulling my own clips from my time

06:17.680 --> 06:23.200
spent with Jonathan Wagan. With all that being said, let's start our investigation and first

06:23.200 --> 06:28.960
travel back all the way to 1997 to relive the experience of Lance Corporal Wagan.

06:34.880 --> 06:41.680
And basically I was there and then I was transferred over to the section for laser

06:41.680 --> 06:48.320
strike in February of 1997. As a young man, Jonathan Wagan joined the Marine Corps in 1995

06:48.880 --> 06:54.080
until 1998. After a back injury suffered in training, Jonathan's service led him to the

06:54.080 --> 06:59.600
second low-altitude air defense battalion within the Marine Corps Air Control Group 28 stationed

06:59.600 --> 07:05.120
at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. During this time, Wagan served as a low-altitude air

07:05.120 --> 07:10.160
defense gunner with training on Stinger man portable air defense systems, man pads, and

07:10.160 --> 07:18.000
Avenger surface-to-air missiles, SAM platforms. In 1997, Wagan and the USMC MACG-28 were deployed

07:18.000 --> 07:23.360
to Bukalpa, Peru to support Operation Laser Strike specifically to operate as perimeter

07:23.360 --> 07:29.200
security for mission radar installations and to replace aging hawk missile batteries with Stinger

07:29.200 --> 07:34.640
and Avenger missile platforms. Laser Strike was one of numerous US worldwide classified

07:34.640 --> 07:40.480
operations under US Southcom or US Southern Command to counter narcotics traffic in Peru.

07:40.480 --> 07:46.400
The operation included up to 20 US agencies including the USMC, Drug Enforcement Agency,

07:46.400 --> 07:52.800
Air Force, CIA, National Guard, and US Army Special Forces, as well as local Peruvian forces such as

07:52.800 --> 07:59.040
Peruvian Air Force or FAP. Laser Strike served to conduct three phases of counter drug operations

07:59.040 --> 08:04.480
including illegal use of airspace, alternate transportation modes, and production capabilities.

08:04.480 --> 08:09.440
Laser Strike employed several acknowledged data acquisition and radar systems to accomplish its

08:09.920 --> 08:17.520
including TPS-43 and relocatable over-the-horizon radar systems, or RothR, and possibly covertly

08:17.520 --> 08:23.840
utilize satellites from the Defense Support Program. In 1996, Laser Strike proceeded Operation

08:23.840 --> 08:29.920
Green Clover, a similar US Southcom operation to combat narcotics transfer in Peru and Colombia

08:29.920 --> 08:36.800
but much smaller in scale. In the 12 month period from April 1996 to April 97, within the timeline

08:36.800 --> 08:43.040
of Jonathan's encounter, air and ground-based radar used by Laser Strike tracked 45,000 total

08:43.040 --> 08:50.240
aircraft. 5,390 of these were quote-unquote tracks of interest. Only 150 of these were

08:50.240 --> 08:56.240
suspected of drug trafficking but only 21 such planes were forced or shot down. However,

08:56.240 --> 09:02.240
the exact number of shoot-downs was classified. Three primary locations satisfied this mission

09:02.320 --> 09:08.720
conducted in Peru, Puculpa, Andoas, and Iquitos, whose mission was to track, identify, and ground

09:08.720 --> 09:14.960
by warning or force drug trafficking aircraft entering or leaving Peruvian airspace. In support

09:14.960 --> 09:20.080
of Laser Strike and counter drug operations, US Special Forces were additionally sent to Iquitos

09:20.080 --> 09:25.680
Peru to the Mar Forlant Riverine Training Team to train with Peruvian military forces.

09:25.680 --> 09:31.760
US Southcom authorized up to 14 Special Forces deployments to the region during 1997,

09:31.760 --> 09:36.960
and one major Special Forces group that aided in South American counter drug operations attached

09:36.960 --> 09:43.200
to US Southcom was the US Army 7th Special Forces Group, aka the US Army Green Berets,

09:43.200 --> 09:48.880
out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Historically, the 7th Special Forces out of SOCOM or Special

09:48.880 --> 09:54.320
Operations Command within the 1st Special Forces Command had previously been deployed in Operation

09:54.320 --> 10:01.200
SNOCAP, a drug enforcement agency counter narcotics operation in 9 Latin American countries alongside

10:01.200 --> 10:06.800
the US Navy SEALs. The Army 7th Special Forces Group has conducted foreign internal defense,

10:06.800 --> 10:11.680
counter drug, and training missions in Central and South America. The 7th specializes in

10:11.680 --> 10:17.760
unconventional warfare and direct action, special reconnaissance, counter proliferation of WMD,

10:17.760 --> 10:21.600
or warheads of mass destruction, and security force assistance.

10:21.600 --> 10:26.000
Why all this discussion of Green Berets and Special Operations Command units attached to

10:26.000 --> 10:31.040
Laser Strike? Recall how quite often I discuss the involvement of Special Operations Command,

10:31.040 --> 10:36.400
or their elite component command, JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command in UFO crash retrieval

10:36.400 --> 10:41.360
operations. Well, this will all become apparent quite soon when discussing Wagan's retrieval

10:41.360 --> 10:46.640
encounter. Up to his involvement in Laser Strike, Jonathan had no interest in the subject of UFOs,

10:46.640 --> 10:51.440
but his worldview was somewhat shaken during his guard station performing perimeter security at

10:51.440 --> 10:56.080
his Laser Strike radar installation. Wagan would state in the command center of the radar

10:56.080 --> 11:01.440
installation he would overhear USAF personnel discussing aircraft tracked flying in and out

11:01.440 --> 11:07.760
of the atmosphere at Mach 10 plus. I knew that these these aircraft were flying because I had been

11:07.760 --> 11:14.080
in the command center there at the radar installation and I heard a couple women there in the Air Force

11:14.080 --> 11:20.560
talking about aircraft flying in and out of the atmosphere at Mach 10 plus. So these aircraft

11:20.560 --> 11:24.560
are flying around there, you know, they're re-entering the atmosphere or whatever they're

11:24.560 --> 11:28.800
talking about. We got these aircraft flying again and the other girl says, yeah, you know,

11:28.800 --> 11:34.080
they're coming in and out of the atmosphere. There's our stuff and so there's our aircraft,

11:34.080 --> 11:39.360
and they're like, you know, I can't remember what she said. Wagan would even state an Air Force

11:39.360 --> 11:44.240
Colonel would enter the command center about 30 minutes after this conversation and confiscate

11:44.240 --> 11:51.840
logbooks tracking flight data. I'm not sure, but I think these logs did contain those tracks,

11:51.840 --> 11:56.960
otherwise they wouldn't have taken them. And we're talking about, you know, there's hundreds,

11:56.960 --> 12:01.600
thousands of aircraft flying through there, you know, weekly and all these logs, you know,

12:01.600 --> 12:05.840
they're writing them in and, you know, and they're keeping their writing, you know, how many times

12:05.840 --> 12:10.880
certain aircraft or they get certain vectors for aircraft that are supposed to be around it.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.400
I mean, when you got, when you got objects that are re-entering the atmosphere and then stopping

12:16.400 --> 12:21.920
on a dog and then turning around and going exactly the opposite direction, that's kind of strange.

12:21.920 --> 12:26.240
Meteors don't do that. Oh, is this something that was rare or something that was happening?

12:26.240 --> 12:30.640
Oh, this was happening all the time. There was like three or four incidents where I was duty there

12:30.640 --> 12:34.160
that the same, the same Air Force officer came in there to give books.

12:35.200 --> 12:40.000
And do you think these were tracked on to the freight arts? Yeah, these were tracked from this

12:40.000 --> 12:45.760
particular radar that were logged in. The reason, I guess the reason they were taking them is they

12:45.760 --> 12:50.720
didn't want people to know that they're tracking these aircraft. I guess, I mean, give us, I'm just

12:50.720 --> 12:56.720
assuming that. One night while on guard duty at around 11 p.m. to midnight between April and March

12:56.720 --> 13:03.040
1997, Wigant was approached by Staff Sergeant Monteligre, Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Adkins,

13:03.040 --> 13:07.840
and told that there was a downed aircraft, possibly friendly, and that he and other Marines were

13:07.840 --> 13:13.600
needed to secure the crash site. By three to four a.m., Jonathan, Adkins, and Allen were in the

13:13.600 --> 13:18.880
vanguard of a group of Humvees among eight to 10 Marines sent to secure the crash area.

13:18.880 --> 13:23.760
After a combination of driving and trekking through the jungle, the Marines reached the site around

13:23.760 --> 13:34.400
six to seven a.m. And they, they came to us and said, look, you know, we got, we got a situation

13:34.480 --> 13:42.720
where we, we have an aircraft crash that's possibly friendly and they need us to go and secure the

13:42.720 --> 13:48.640
crash site and we're like fine. So this is early, this is late at night. I'm about 11 or 12 at night.

13:49.280 --> 13:54.160
I was on guard duty that night. So I was already up and it was my shift. We have 12 hour shifts,

13:54.160 --> 14:02.480
12 on, 12 off, and where we, where we rotate our section. So we all went out that night. We got up

14:03.040 --> 14:07.360
I don't know, three or four in the morning and headed out in Humvees. We had about five or

14:07.360 --> 14:12.320
six Hummers and we drove to where we needed to go. And then we, from there, you know, we had to

14:12.320 --> 14:18.240
hump through the bush. So we got there, I don't know, six, seven, just, just one daylight had just

14:18.240 --> 14:24.400
just started to get light. And well, we found the area really easy because there was a, there was a

14:24.400 --> 14:30.960
huge gash in the land where, where something had crashed. And it, it didn't break anything. You

14:30.960 --> 14:35.360
know, you know, I don't know if you've ever been to a crash site where, you know, you had, you know,

14:35.360 --> 14:40.800
had trees, you know, just broken like, like in half. Everything was burned. And it was like,

14:40.800 --> 14:45.440
like if you had almost cut like a warm butter with a knife, I mean, it was just,

14:46.240 --> 14:51.280
it's like, it's, it's like something on fire or had energy or some kind of energy and like a laser

14:51.280 --> 14:56.640
almost had, had like gutted. I mean, it was really strange. And anyway, I was, I was in the front

14:56.640 --> 15:02.880
with Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Ankins. We were up front. And we were, we were point basically.

15:02.880 --> 15:07.040
And we were like, I don't know, 10, 20 meters and head of everyone else. We had, we all had

15:07.040 --> 15:12.240
maps and radios and compasses. So we knew so we wouldn't get lost. And basically, we were the

15:12.240 --> 15:19.520
first ones to see the object. And basically what happened is we didn't go straight up the hill.

15:19.520 --> 15:24.320
Because basically this thing went up the hill and then off into the side of the ravine of the

15:24.320 --> 15:30.160
ridge. This is about a 200 foot ridge, at least solid granite. I mean, it's rock. I don't know

15:30.160 --> 15:36.400
if it's granite. It was buried in the side of the cliff. But anyway, we didn't go straight up. We went

15:36.400 --> 15:42.000
to the, to the, to all to the left and walked up to the top of the ridge. And that's when we saw the

15:42.000 --> 15:48.640
craft. But I mean, it had landed and cut its way through the jungle and embedded itself in the,

15:48.640 --> 15:53.040
in like a, I don't know what you would call it almost like a saddle or one of these kind of

15:53.120 --> 16:00.240
foothills. It's kind of a ridge and it went into the side of it. And I can't remember how far from

16:00.240 --> 16:06.960
the initial impact that when it landed, it actually physically hit the deck and then went in. I don't

16:06.960 --> 16:12.800
know how far down it was. Yeah, yeah, man. It burned itself like into the deck, you know, like a foot

16:12.800 --> 16:18.080
or two. I don't know. It was deep. The terrified and confused Marines climbed down the ridge to get

16:18.080 --> 16:23.520
closer to this object with Waygant getting the closest of all the Marines. Waygant Allen and

16:23.520 --> 16:30.320
Adkins observed a huge ship embedded at a 45 degree angle into the rocky cliff face. This is the

16:30.320 --> 16:37.040
craft. This is pretty crude two dimensional drawing. But this is jungle here. And this was the craft

16:37.040 --> 16:45.520
and it was embedded in the rock like this. And I'm not sure if this tapered off or how it went.

16:45.520 --> 16:51.120
But these right here are the hatches, these two objects here. This one was the one that was half

16:51.120 --> 16:55.840
open. And you could see into it. But I mean, it was just black is like looking into a closet.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.520
Damage I think from the missile. And these were these large vents, they look like they went into

17:03.520 --> 17:08.800
the craft, but I couldn't tell. But I mean, it was a shadow. That was the only thing that really

17:08.800 --> 17:16.160
cast a shadow. The rest of this was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow where you

17:16.160 --> 17:20.720
could see where there wasn't light. But the sun was shining around on the object and it didn't

17:20.720 --> 17:26.480
cast a shadow not on anything. It was like kind of like absorbing the light. It's weird. Strange.

17:26.480 --> 17:32.800
There was no reflection or anything like that. The object was a massive metallic egg or teardrop

17:32.800 --> 17:39.520
shape measuring 10 meters in height and 20 meters in length. Probably like three or four

17:40.880 --> 17:49.600
standard 53 foot trailers wide and about three, like like one, two, three, four,

17:50.400 --> 17:56.880
one, two, three, four. So about 16 of those together. So it was pretty big, man. It was

17:56.880 --> 18:02.000
catastrophic damage likely leading to the crash of the vehicle was visible. No debris littered

18:02.000 --> 18:07.600
the area, but Wageant observed an enormous gash in the rear of the craft. Jonathan guessed this

18:07.600 --> 18:13.280
damage to be from Hawk MIM-23 missile batteries. Although Hawk systems were phased out of military

18:13.280 --> 18:20.960
use in 1994, the USMC maintained usage until 2002. However, Wageant guessed the Hawk system used to

18:20.960 --> 18:27.040
down the craft was used by the Peruvian Air Force. This being because the USMC phased out Hawk

18:27.040 --> 18:32.960
missiles from laser strike in early 1997. Though he has no direct knowledge to this day,

18:32.960 --> 18:38.880
Wageant after extensive studying of MIM-23 ballistics believes Hawk fragmentation missiles

18:38.880 --> 18:43.920
caused the damage and downing of the craft. Yeah, well, what I think happened, I think a lot of

18:43.920 --> 18:49.920
that fragmentation like went into the craft and like bounced around right after it got

18:49.920 --> 18:55.600
headed as it was going down. So it probably didn't come out. But like I said, if the missile had hit

18:56.560 --> 19:02.720
depending on what the craft was made of and depending on the speed of the missile and its

19:02.720 --> 19:08.720
angle and all that, I think it probably would have penetrated and exploded and it would have

19:08.720 --> 19:14.560
just disintegrated the ship totally. This then presents a unique question. How could a conventional

19:14.560 --> 19:20.480
missile down a highly advanced non-human craft? Similar intriguing incidents like a quote-unquote

19:20.480 --> 19:26.800
one in a million targeting of a teardrop shaped UFO by a naval destroyer in 1973 was discussed in

19:26.800 --> 19:33.120
my last project on naval legacy programs. MIM-23 Hawk missiles are unique. Hawks are not only able

19:33.120 --> 19:39.040
to utilize conventional missiles but also airburst rounds which exploded near not on a target to

19:39.040 --> 19:44.720
damage enemy personnel or vehicles with devastating fragmentation. Perhaps a conventional missile

19:44.720 --> 19:51.680
could never hit a moving UFO but perhaps in this case a hawk MIM-23 got just close enough to frag

19:51.680 --> 19:57.360
and down a target. But let's get back to the wreckage. The best way Wigant could describe the

19:57.360 --> 20:03.600
craft was metallic but organic almost as if it was alive. The object did not appear as if it was

20:03.600 --> 20:10.000
made of machine parts but more sculpted. The craft was purplish green and fluctuating in color almost

20:10.080 --> 20:15.200
like gasoline on water. This effect is known as the mother of pearl effect and the changing colors

20:15.200 --> 20:21.600
would sometimes even make the craft near translucent. Well I thought at one point it

20:21.600 --> 20:27.200
looked half like green and half purple and then it was kind of it was it was changing

20:28.320 --> 20:34.000
the image of the not not the physical properties of it how it was was constructed or whatever

20:34.720 --> 20:40.480
but that there was some kind of field on it and it was going like I said with Greer it was like

20:40.480 --> 20:46.560
you know when you wash your car would you know fluid right with like palm olive or whatever

20:46.560 --> 20:52.880
disc detergent and when it bubbles up it gives like the the color chemical rainbow it was like

20:52.880 --> 20:59.120
that but all over the craft and it was kind of like moving around weird I can't so it wasn't

20:59.200 --> 21:05.520
just no no it was it was kind of like moving around and going sometimes it would go like

21:05.520 --> 21:12.080
completely like almost like silver right the disabled craft was dripping a liquid with the

21:12.080 --> 21:17.680
viscosity of syrup this liquid had poured all over the surrounding foliage that hatch

21:18.480 --> 21:24.320
that was a jar or busted open broke open that's where the liquid seemed to come from right

21:24.400 --> 21:27.360
and it seemed to come out of there and it was everywhere man

21:28.880 --> 21:36.720
it was clear well no the the the whatever that stuff was I don't know what to call it the fluid

21:36.720 --> 21:43.600
it was clear like just you know water water clear the fluid was clear yeah but it was viscous like

21:43.600 --> 21:48.480
yeah but it was thick like maple syrup a large sweeping light traveled around the circumference

21:48.480 --> 21:53.360
of the vehicle that slowed until the vehicle seemingly powered off along with this sweeping

21:53.360 --> 21:58.640
light wagan could hear the craft dimming until it went silent wagan described the sound as a

21:58.640 --> 22:05.680
guitar amplifier there was there was one light on it that slowly went around and in the machine I

22:05.680 --> 22:12.320
could hear it I can hear I guess because it was still functioning and had like a like a hum to it

22:12.320 --> 22:18.560
like like a really bass like say if you unplugged an amp from a guitar that kind of you know it was

22:18.880 --> 22:24.160
really really you know it's really deep but it was loud it was loud man it was like a deep

22:24.880 --> 22:30.800
like that like you know rap it would be it would have been like several orders of magnitude louder

22:30.800 --> 22:39.200
than you know the real deep bass rap boom boom boom right it was like boom it was like this but it

22:39.200 --> 22:44.000
was more like a I don't know man I just can't describe it's not even like that man it's just

22:44.000 --> 22:50.400
indescribable it was that light cycling it's almost sounded like a chemical sound man like a chemical

22:50.400 --> 22:55.920
like watery kind of like sound man like you're it's weird and that light was slowing down right yeah

22:55.920 --> 23:01.280
it finally stopped right everything like shut off this sound of a guitar amp is almost identical

23:01.280 --> 23:06.480
to the testimony of former marine michael herera who described the same sound emanating from an

23:06.480 --> 23:12.560
eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle as jonathan got closer to the craft he was able to make out more

23:12.560 --> 23:18.720
surface detail such as the craft not being smooth but featuring what looked to be notches and bumps

23:18.720 --> 23:24.400
50 to 100 yards away from the craft jonathan got the mysterious liquid all over what marines call

23:24.400 --> 23:31.280
camis or battle dress uniform the liquid discolored his camis like acid and ate jonathan's skin

23:32.000 --> 23:36.800
so you got within like 150 or 300 view of this right this thing was so high up on the cliff

23:36.800 --> 23:40.800
phase you got some of this liquid on yeah yeah it was everywhere man and what did it do to you

23:40.800 --> 23:46.480
what did it do to your clothes well i mean they took my clothes but my basic my hair on my legs

23:46.480 --> 23:52.400
went away and it's never really come back i lost all my hair on my on my on my legs determined yet

23:52.400 --> 23:57.920
frightened the young lance corporal maintained his gaze on this incredible ship the crashed vehicle

23:57.920 --> 24:03.760
additionally featured large vents on the freestanding side wagant described similar to fish gills

24:03.760 --> 24:08.720
though he could only see one side of the craft jonathan wagered these same gills he guessed

24:08.720 --> 24:13.920
were used for propulsion were featured on the other side of the craft yeah on the part of it

24:13.920 --> 24:21.440
looked like i don't know what it was but yeah it had sort of like these um under a really tight

24:21.440 --> 24:29.440
kind of like ellipse that ran down the side like got small got got progressively smaller

24:30.640 --> 24:36.160
and i only saw it like a couple freaking times because it was the weird i don't know what it was

24:36.320 --> 24:43.360
the all i could say it was like some type of four shield i don't know what it was three seemingly

24:43.360 --> 24:49.840
non-flush hatches sat near the top of the craft one of these hatches being half open although no

24:49.840 --> 24:54.880
lights were visible from behind the hatch wagant did observe what appeared to be a four-fingered

24:54.880 --> 25:01.040
arm hanging limply from the open hatch this element of wagant's testimony was seemingly cut from his

25:01.120 --> 25:07.120
2000 interview with wagant confirming to me that it must have indeed been cut as he did inform

25:07.120 --> 25:14.800
greer of this arm yeah one of the creatures was his arm and hand was hanging out he was hanging out

25:15.360 --> 25:19.680
did it come out was it hanging out when you walked up to it or was it yeah he was hanging out probably

25:19.680 --> 25:24.240
dying i don't know about the other pilot i don't know what they were to be honest with you but

25:24.240 --> 25:30.000
i guess you could call them aliens or whatever i guess that would be yeah yeah right and uh one of

25:30.480 --> 25:38.240
i think he was dying almost or close to death right from the crash but like i said this is

25:39.280 --> 25:44.560
this is what i thought at the time i mean i don't know this detail is very interesting as i am

25:44.560 --> 25:50.960
reminded of the 1965 keksburg pennsylvania crash retrieval encounter where multiple eyewitnesses

25:50.960 --> 25:56.960
described biologics inside the bell shaped craft whose appendages were visible once a craft hatch

25:56.960 --> 26:03.040
had opened and the vehicle was depressurized so you and two sergeants kind of who led the vanguard

26:03.040 --> 26:07.360
got the closest to craft but you got the closest right i was the closest to it and the other two

26:07.360 --> 26:13.360
sergeants were kind of standing a little bit off while you got right yeah and i ran up to it was

26:13.360 --> 26:17.920
there anything weird about your guys's compasses comms yeah all that was all you know it wasn't

26:17.920 --> 26:24.160
working so your compass was it just going haywire yeah it was spinning around around the same time

26:24.160 --> 26:30.320
jonathan felt like a presence was reaching out to contact him you got a clear sense that there were

26:31.920 --> 26:38.160
some kind of life forms yes it was life forms and the ship i and i could they were it's almost

26:38.160 --> 26:43.920
like if someone was like reading your mind and that's the way it felt and i felt like i felt a

26:43.920 --> 26:52.640
presence it's like supernatural you know but i felt this presence that it's real strange i guess it

26:52.640 --> 26:58.880
was almost like i think the kree i told leslie is i thought the creatures were they called me and it

26:58.880 --> 27:03.680
was like weird they were i think they were trying to communicate with me like i guess telepathically

27:03.680 --> 27:08.960
it's really weird i don't believe in it and any of that stuff but anyway it was i could i could hear

27:08.960 --> 27:15.120
like it was terrible because it kept going and then it still comes and goes it's like basically

27:15.120 --> 27:20.160
sitting in your car and turning on like an am station that's not the you know it's just white

27:20.240 --> 27:25.440
noise just turning on really high and that's what i heard when i when i first got in there and i

27:25.440 --> 27:31.120
didn't ask any of the other guys that i was with if they heard that or anything jonathan was mesmerized

27:31.120 --> 27:35.840
by this presence he felt the creatures were informing him that everything would be all right but

27:35.840 --> 27:42.000
we're also requesting his help he was so spellbound he ignored the cries and cussings of sergeants

27:42.000 --> 27:47.520
alan and adkins who stood away from the craft shouting at wey gantt not to get any closer

27:47.520 --> 27:54.480
they were they were scared it was the apprehension the fear and then they they were not here at

27:54.480 --> 27:59.680
home is that's really what what it felt like and i mean that's not that's not my own emotions

27:59.680 --> 28:03.600
that was something that they were projecting towards me like if somebody would shadow like a

28:03.600 --> 28:09.200
spotlight i mean that's what i felt they were directing their thoughts at me i mean this is not

28:10.000 --> 28:15.520
i mean i didn't think about all this at the time but it's been the currencies were i've seen the

28:15.520 --> 28:23.120
creatures of my in my thoughts and i've seen i saw them what they look like and they projected

28:23.120 --> 28:28.560
and i didn't i didn't tell leon i didn't tell leslie this you know i was it was like you know it was

28:28.560 --> 28:34.560
the grays basically and and i'm not just saying that but and i never really was into the ufo stuff

28:34.560 --> 28:40.400
and i didn't read books on when i was a kid but basically the the oval that the the oval egg had

28:40.400 --> 28:48.960
with big dark eyes big eyes our nose and small mouth new ears i think i've had you know dreams of them

28:50.080 --> 28:55.760
i don't you know so but i didn't see them but they were not the small you know small kind of like

28:55.760 --> 28:59.840
three or four foot right they were huge you said these were tall like eight to ten feet yeah they

28:59.840 --> 29:05.600
were huge yeah what it what were their heads like like classic yeah classic but really like elongated

29:06.320 --> 29:10.880
kind of coming up like this and they'd have been probably this big like a balloon yeah no

29:11.760 --> 29:17.760
like the kind of like the more oblong shape not like the classic if you look at communion right

29:17.760 --> 29:24.080
the wittly streber right but the artwork they have on there they would not have been fat like that

29:24.080 --> 29:31.040
they were more skinnier but they were also like on a kind of a skinny heart they were

29:31.040 --> 29:36.640
projecting that they weren't here they were here they were here they weren't here you know that they

29:36.640 --> 29:40.960
weren't not going to harm me that was basically that everything is going to be all right just

29:40.960 --> 29:47.520
help me get this helps get out of here i think do i don't i don't know how many were on the craft

29:47.520 --> 29:52.720
yeah that's more than one yeah definitely more than one probably about four or five i don't

29:52.720 --> 29:57.440
know just this not i mean not a water's number the communication from the occupants of the craft

29:57.440 --> 30:02.320
as well as the appearance of the craft led jonathan to believe this vehicle was controlled

30:02.320 --> 30:07.760
via thoughts with the massive discussion of psionics here in 2025 through the testimony of

30:07.760 --> 30:14.720
jake barber and sky watchers this early mention of basically psionics in 2000 by wagant is extremely

30:14.720 --> 30:20.480
interesting additionally i have discussed before dating all the way back to the 1950s stories and

30:20.480 --> 30:25.440
testimonies of ufo's being controlled with consciousness headband transceivers are unique

30:25.440 --> 30:30.640
control mechanisms to learn more about this subject i do recommend checking out my video on

30:30.640 --> 30:36.400
the claims of colonel philip j corso after about 15 to 20 minutes at the site wagant and the other

30:36.400 --> 30:41.760
marines embarked to climb back up the ridge to rendezvous with the rest of the mac g28 marines

30:41.760 --> 30:47.920
when they were greeted by two to four army ch-47 helicopters flying overhead preparing to land

30:47.920 --> 30:52.960
in a nearby clearing when jonathan and the others climbed to the top of the gorge the marines were

30:52.960 --> 30:59.040
quickly intercepted by armed men dressed in black fatigue styled similarly to a swat team

30:59.040 --> 31:05.440
it was almost like they were there already they were on the ground already and and whoever was

31:05.440 --> 31:11.360
flying over was coming in after they these guys had landed so i'm and i'm not sure where they

31:11.360 --> 31:16.240
they landed where they were but they were just there on top of the site within a few minutes and so

31:17.200 --> 31:20.880
i can't remember exactly how it's speculation on your part you don't know for sure but you

31:20.880 --> 31:23.840
think it's possible that team may have been there first yeah they were all they were definitely

31:23.840 --> 31:29.200
there first and they were monitoring us too i'm sure they knew we were in the area we got up there

31:29.200 --> 31:34.640
and you're but they looked army but they didn't have you know insignia on them right they were same

31:34.640 --> 31:41.040
color and all this these men spoke with american dialects but bore no insignia patches or identification

31:41.040 --> 31:47.200
the men were older in their late 30s and 40s and immediately showed signs of extreme hostility

31:47.200 --> 31:54.000
and aggression black bdus right what was the army would call bdus like our camis right they're

31:54.000 --> 32:00.240
like our our uh fatigues but they would have been totally black totally black sure and they had helmets

32:00.240 --> 32:07.600
on um no the guys that were on the deck no they had uh those uh they had boony caps and they had

32:07.600 --> 32:13.920
just the soft uh army covers round army covers do you remember what kind of weapons they had was it

32:14.000 --> 32:22.480
back here in the marisa i think they had mp3s and and glocks and shotguns okay so i think maybe

32:22.480 --> 32:27.680
there was a few m16s i mean this has been a long time they had many guns on the on the on the uh

32:27.680 --> 32:32.880
47s so the ch is actually had they had many guns on the side did they have a man at the gun yeah

32:32.880 --> 32:38.640
they had a man and he was wearing like this skull type of freaking helmet man it's like a really wicked

32:38.640 --> 32:44.080
yeah it looks so when when this team encountered you guys did they have their weapons trained at

32:44.080 --> 32:50.160
you were you not at gunpoint oh yeah and so they immediately start do they strip you guys of gear

32:50.160 --> 32:55.360
what do they rough you up yeah no they were we were setting our gear up and taking them out and

32:55.360 --> 33:00.160
throwing it out and emptying our pockets and everything later in our investigation we will

33:00.160 --> 33:05.520
devote a significant amount of time to attempt to track down the origin of this team so sit tight

33:05.520 --> 33:10.960
for a little bit having the jump on the marines the unknown operators stripped wagan allen and

33:10.960 --> 33:16.160
adkins of their gear and weapons the young lance corporal took a swing at one of the men cracking

33:16.160 --> 33:22.560
him on his head for his transgressions jonathan was beaten restrained and forced to lie down face

33:22.560 --> 33:28.240
down on the jungle floor getting even more of the strange liquid on him during this scuffle a team

33:28.240 --> 33:34.400
of near 30 began departing the landed ch 47 helicopters this team featured individuals in

33:34.400 --> 33:41.360
rain jackets bearing three letters delta oscar echo oh yeah they were like scientists i suppose

33:41.360 --> 33:48.880
they had uh this type of uh like um we call it mop gear right mission oriented protective posture

33:48.880 --> 33:55.600
and uh they had gas masks on and like rubber suits and uh they were they were coming around and yet

33:55.600 --> 34:02.160
all kinds of weird people there some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on

34:03.040 --> 34:10.320
and personal protective gear and uh and it was all different ones different kinds do we is of

34:10.320 --> 34:15.360
course the acronym for the infamous department of energy the successor to the atomic energy

34:15.360 --> 34:22.480
commission whose 1954 atomic energy act historically served as a monolith to misclassify ufo materials

34:22.480 --> 34:28.720
and data as quote unquote trans classified foreign nuclear information is there any indication that

34:28.800 --> 34:34.320
department of energy is involved in uap data collection and housing i don't have an answer

34:35.200 --> 34:42.000
i can't confirm or deny that in a public setting and could you do it in a secure setting yes the

34:42.000 --> 34:46.960
do we really needs no introduction whether it's my work the reporting of chris sharp or the words

34:46.960 --> 34:54.000
of david grush the do we is almost always mentioned as a primary pillar of ufo legacy program operations

34:54.000 --> 35:00.080
key in my work are the numerous implications of the does ffr dcs or federally funded research and

35:00.080 --> 35:05.280
development centers such as laurence livermore national labs low salamos national labs sandia

35:05.280 --> 35:11.520
national labs and do we contractors such as triad national security one third of which is run by

35:11.520 --> 35:17.200
betel memorial institutes direct involvement in technologies of unknown origin exploitation

35:17.200 --> 35:22.240
programs and similar to the seasoned operators soon in this video we will attempt to track down

35:22.240 --> 35:28.160
exactly what this do we team was where they were stationed and more in addition to the people in

35:28.160 --> 35:33.280
department of energy rain jackets the team featured members dressed in biological containment

35:33.280 --> 35:40.480
suits dawned with do we lettering we can't describe these as similar to spacesuits it wasn't like

35:40.480 --> 35:45.600
that it was more high-tech like this big jumpsuits that you zip up the back and you can like we're

35:45.600 --> 35:51.520
breathing apparatus in there those guys there was about 30 of them at least and they marched right by

35:51.520 --> 35:56.720
me as i was i was being taken away they were marching to get down into the cliff i guess they

35:56.720 --> 36:02.160
were in there to check this thing out these suits mentioned remindingly closely of myriad crash

36:02.160 --> 36:07.200
retrieval team testimonies i've covered in the past and i'm immediately reminded of eyewitness

36:07.200 --> 36:13.200
accounts to the 1965 kexburg pennsylvania ufo crash where witnesses claimed that men in quote

36:13.200 --> 36:19.040
unquote moon suits carried boxes and equipment into the crash site a little while later there

36:19.040 --> 36:25.920
was a large truck pulled in a light colored truck box van pipe out of it there was four guys come

36:25.920 --> 36:33.440
out they had what we call moon suits at the time they were white coverall type suit they took a

36:33.440 --> 36:42.320
box out of their box maybe four or five foot square they carried down four handles and they

36:42.320 --> 36:48.240
carried that down to the object but just right after that there was a military man

36:49.200 --> 36:54.000
after being restrained and beaten by the operators jonathan was stripped his underwear by the men

36:54.000 --> 36:59.040
in containment suits before having his feet bound and was handcuffed to a stretcher did the other

36:59.040 --> 37:03.920
two sergeants have any liquid on them uh no not that i remember i'm the only one i think got hit with

37:03.920 --> 37:11.440
all that because they were they they did not go up under the the craft and in the very close immediate

37:11.600 --> 37:17.440
vicinity of it at this time wagant was separated from alan and adkins and taken aboard one of the

37:17.440 --> 37:23.120
teen's helicopters no no they said that you know that that that that i was they were cussing at me

37:23.120 --> 37:30.000
saying that i was a why don't you why don't you f*** people ever you know pay attention to orders

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
you aren't supposed to be there and you're not supposed to see this and you know you're

37:34.000 --> 37:37.760
you're going to be dangerous if we let you go and all this stuff yeah i mean i thought i was i

37:37.760 --> 37:41.120
thought they were going to kill me really i thought we have i'm f***ing finished you

37:41.760 --> 37:46.480
wagant was flown to a base different than his deployment site this location featured

37:46.480 --> 37:51.040
significantly more permanent structures than his radar site and jonathan guessed this was

37:51.040 --> 37:57.760
partially a peruvian military installation curiously here wagant observed not just americans on site

37:57.760 --> 38:02.400
but many nationalities there's a lot of other nationalities there are chinese

38:02.960 --> 38:06.320
germans i think were there i mean a lot of other people were at this other base

38:07.040 --> 38:12.000
but i mean this thing it was really i mean i didn't go in and all they did was take me to like a

38:12.000 --> 38:18.720
like a you couldn't call it a cell it was more of like a it was more like an interrogation but

38:18.720 --> 38:24.080
i sat in there for i don't know 15 hours yeah they were merged man that was the other thing because

38:25.360 --> 38:31.120
yeah a lot of those dudes didn't the china there was two chinese dudes there that i remember

38:31.120 --> 38:36.160
they spent very little english but they were in the german the german spent perfect english right

38:36.160 --> 38:41.920
they were in military fatigues yeah same black do they have weapons yeah pistols i would assume

38:41.920 --> 38:46.720
that they were glocks but i didn't i couldn't see them because they're the they're the standard

38:47.360 --> 38:53.360
us pistol like and it covers it up they were holstered on the hip yeah right so this these guys

38:53.920 --> 38:57.600
by their black hammies may have been from the same team yeah i was looking at them and they

38:57.600 --> 39:02.960
yelled at me they're not for me not to look at them look at them wow i didn't think they wanted

39:02.960 --> 39:06.720
me to remember and that's what they why they did that from what you could see what were they doing

39:06.720 --> 39:11.200
were they just kind of at general station yeah just whatever they were doing i don't know what they

39:11.200 --> 39:17.120
were doing with whatever i have a strong thesis of where this location might be and we will discuss

39:17.120 --> 39:23.200
this soon wagant was not taken into a cell or forced into isolated barracks but was instead taken

39:23.200 --> 39:29.040
underground and sequestered in an interrogation room where he was contained for up to two days

39:29.040 --> 39:33.600
during this hellacious stay jonathan was interrogated and tormented by one of the

39:33.600 --> 39:39.600
operators who detained him and i couldn't really relatively identify any of these guys but i knew

39:39.600 --> 39:45.040
i knew that i knew one of them was at the crash site because they were one of the guys that i

39:45.040 --> 39:50.160
recognized because he was in black fatigue and he's like what you see and he's like weird and he's

39:50.240 --> 39:56.080
like growling you know he goes are you a patriot you like the constitution i'm like yeah he's like

39:56.080 --> 40:00.480
well we don't we do it you know we're on our own program you know we don't obey we just do what we

40:00.480 --> 40:04.560
want he's like yeah and they're like and they're growling and they're relishing you know and they're

40:04.560 --> 40:09.200
yelling at me and they're hollering the cursing we didn't see anything you know and we'll do you

40:09.200 --> 40:15.040
and your whole family and they're you know it was it was basically that for about eight or nine hours

40:15.040 --> 40:20.080
i mean they took breaks basically they're like look man we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna just

40:20.080 --> 40:24.960
we're gonna take you off in the helicopter when we was kicked out out of the jungle and you're just

40:24.960 --> 40:30.000
gonna get you know we're gonna end you and all this and they didn't physically they didn't physically

40:30.000 --> 40:34.400
put their hands on me i was sitting in a chair and i was handcuffed in the chair and i couldn't

40:35.280 --> 40:40.320
so basically you know it was just this this like harassment towards the end of his confinement

40:40.320 --> 40:45.760
a lieutenant colonel from the air force visited weigand this colonel bore no name tag nor did he

40:45.760 --> 40:51.280
disclose his identity the colonel threatened weigand's life repeatedly telling him this clandestine

40:51.280 --> 40:56.560
operation would have no trouble leaving weigand dead in the jungle the colonel then made weigand

40:56.560 --> 41:02.800
sign multiple documents securing his silence on his incredible yet horrific encounter and he told me

41:02.800 --> 41:07.440
you know you know you know if we just took you out in the jungle you know they'd never find you

41:07.440 --> 41:12.320
out there and i'm like and you know i didn't want to see you know you know i didn't want to test

41:12.320 --> 41:16.720
and see if you'd really do that so i said yeah and he's like you got to sign these papers and

41:16.720 --> 41:22.800
you never saw this and i don't exist in this situation never happened and if you tell anybody

41:22.800 --> 41:29.760
you know you know you'll just come on messing and and he was a real abrasive just just just a cynical

41:30.960 --> 41:36.800
i guess the best way to put it you know what what papers well there were it was a the standard

41:36.800 --> 41:42.960
form that you signed for it's like it's almost like a waiver i don't know i'd probably be able to

41:42.960 --> 41:48.080
identify another paper like that i guess it's it's for if you if you've seen something you're not

41:48.080 --> 41:54.640
supposed to sign that you didn't see it or whatever it's basically a security form i believe and there

41:54.640 --> 42:00.720
was two of those that i signed and after that i was driven back to my base jonathan was finally

42:00.720 --> 42:06.560
driven back to his original radar installation this is a key point here for our upcoming investigation

42:06.560 --> 42:12.800
wagon was in close enough proximity to be driven back to the original base and not flown i don't

42:12.800 --> 42:19.680
remember leaving though but i know i went out because they they they put a uh they put a mask over

42:19.680 --> 42:26.800
me i had a mask over me when i when i got to the base they put it on before i got out of the helicopter

42:27.680 --> 42:35.200
and uh when i left from where i was where they held me they put one on um i mean it had something

42:35.280 --> 42:39.920
open where i could breathe but i couldn't see and i couldn't hear and they brought me out and

42:39.920 --> 42:44.880
they took me to this flatline jonathan was segregated with use af personnel at his

42:44.880 --> 42:50.800
original base for three weeks before being sent back to cherry point while there jonathan had no

42:50.800 --> 42:58.240
opportunity to contact allen adkins or the other marines by may of 97 while still in service jonathan

42:58.240 --> 43:04.560
became tormented by the event experiencing horrific nightmares missing time and weird dreams

43:04.560 --> 43:09.280
none of these symptoms had occurred before witnessing the crash to this day jonathan

43:09.280 --> 43:15.680
maintains there were internal usmc attempts to make him appear unstable and an unreliable witness

43:15.680 --> 43:21.120
by late 97 jonathan confessed to using banned substances so he could be discharged by the

43:21.120 --> 43:27.680
marines around this time mac g 28 and the criminal investigation division made his life horrific and

43:27.680 --> 43:34.240
by march of 1998 wagon was discharged now let's move over to investigating the retrieval encounter

43:34.240 --> 43:39.760
in extreme detail an attempt to break down every single detail of this retrieval

43:45.360 --> 43:51.200
after we climbed back up the uh the i think the doe department of energy people were there

43:51.200 --> 43:57.040
they knew about it and i don't know why we went there still in this day but anyway i was arrested

43:57.920 --> 44:03.840
uh i had all my gear taken from me by men and black hammies had no no name tags they were older

44:04.400 --> 44:09.600
probably in their third late 30s or 40s i got a little scuffle with them and i hit one of them i

44:09.600 --> 44:16.880
took a swing one of them and i hit him in the forehead yeah they had they had the big d you

44:16.880 --> 44:22.880
know delta oscar echo on the back of their back of a couple the guys were wearing like these uh

44:22.880 --> 44:28.880
these rain jackets because it had been raining the fall of the previous day and they were in

44:28.880 --> 44:32.560
there and there were other guys that were wearing containment like biological suits

44:35.440 --> 44:40.160
it wasn't like that it was more high-tech like those big jump suits that you zip up the back and

44:40.160 --> 44:45.920
you can like wear a breathing apparatus in there those guys there was about 30 of them at least

44:45.920 --> 44:51.200
and they marched right by me as i was i was being taken away they were marching to get down into

44:51.200 --> 44:55.920
the cliff i guess they were in there to check this thing out on their black uniforms was there any

44:56.000 --> 45:01.200
sign of rank no no rank okay no name tapes none of that but when you encounter these guys was

45:01.200 --> 45:05.360
there any semblance that there was a hierarchy oh yeah there was definitely a yeah there was

45:05.360 --> 45:09.520
definitely higher the team leader was he an aggressive one or oh they were all aggressive

45:09.520 --> 45:13.920
i just i don't know man to be honest with you could you gauge the temperament of the doe team

45:13.920 --> 45:20.000
did they seem to focus on the mission what no they were kind of like power man going crazy

45:20.000 --> 45:25.040
running around swarming like rats yeah do they have any equipment yeah i don't know what it was

45:25.040 --> 45:30.000
before we investigate let's quickly review jonathan's encounter with this unknown military

45:30.000 --> 45:35.440
and scientific team near the crash site ignoring cries of danger by sergeant allen and sergeant

45:35.440 --> 45:40.720
adkins lands corporal weigh gantt cut only 15 to 20 minutes at the crash site before two to four

45:40.720 --> 45:47.760
us army ch 47 chinooks began to land in the nearby hasty lz climbing out of the ravine the marines

45:47.760 --> 45:54.160
were met by operators in black camis featuring no insignia or identification these operators who spoke

45:54.240 --> 46:00.880
with american dialects likely arrived prior to the teams in the ch 47s and disarmed and apprehended

46:00.880 --> 46:06.160
the marines being a rambunctious young soldier weigh gantt took a swing at one of the clandestine

46:06.160 --> 46:11.760
operators connecting his fist with the man's head these rogue operators restrained jonathan and

46:11.760 --> 46:17.040
forcefully laid him face down on the ground where he got more of the strange clear syrupy liquid on

46:17.040 --> 46:22.880
him while jonathan was being restrained a group of maybe 30 began walking from the landed ch 47s

46:22.880 --> 46:27.360
down into the crash site in the ravine the personnel were comprised largely of men in

46:27.360 --> 46:34.320
rain jackets marked delta oscar echo or do e aka the department of energy alongside these men

46:34.320 --> 46:39.600
were multiple individuals in suits and hazmat gear jonathan described as mission oriented

46:39.600 --> 46:45.120
protective posture or mop gear jonathan was forced to strip to his underwear discarding the

46:45.120 --> 46:50.240
clothes covered in the mysterious liquid by the suit clad do e personnel before having his hands

46:50.240 --> 46:56.480
cuffed feet bound and he was then carried onto a stretcher to one of the ch 47s jonathan was not

46:56.480 --> 47:01.520
taken aboard with sergeant atkins and sergeant allen but instead isolated and forcefully taken

47:01.520 --> 47:07.040
to an unknown camp let's pause here and break this down jonathan's mention of do e assets in

47:07.040 --> 47:12.240
the peruvian jungle gives us some extremely actionable data points remember weigh gantt and

47:12.240 --> 47:17.600
his fellow marines learned about the crash between 11 p.m. and midnight departed to investigate around

47:17.600 --> 47:22.960
three to four a.m. and arrived to the crash site around six to seven a.m. from intelligence to

47:22.960 --> 47:30.000
arrival the marines took a maximum of eight hours in roughly the same time span plus maybe an extra

47:30.000 --> 47:34.560
hour or two if the department of energy was privy to advance signals intelligence of the

47:34.560 --> 47:41.360
ufo being targeted possibly by peruvian hawk mim 23 missile batteries the do e was able to mobilize

47:41.360 --> 47:47.680
american personnel assets and containment suits to secure the crash area this would imply the recovery

47:47.680 --> 47:54.320
team was highly organized and likely a rapid reaction recovery unit this unit was able to plan

47:54.320 --> 48:01.040
mobilize execute and contain a ufo crash retrieval site within roughly eight to nine hours remember

48:01.040 --> 48:06.240
back to my work on us o retrievals in the deep submergence rescue vehicle under project sand

48:06.800 --> 48:13.280
such submersibles were deployable anywhere in the world within 72 hours this 30 plus man team

48:13.280 --> 48:20.960
was able to deploy and react to peru in roughly 11 percent of that 72 hours in numerous videos in

48:20.960 --> 48:27.280
the past i have spoken about ufo crash retrieval rapid recovery units whether this be the use half

48:27.280 --> 48:34.000
blue berets allegedly on site for the 1965 kexpert pennsylvania crash retrieval the blue boys rapid

48:34.080 --> 48:38.960
retrieval and transport helicopter units relate to lennard stringfield or the rapid response

48:38.960 --> 48:45.040
use half unit first on site to the 1953 kingman arizona crash stories of highly structured

48:45.040 --> 48:51.680
and efficient dedicated ufo recovery units are inseparable from ufo crash retrieval testimonies

48:51.680 --> 48:58.400
in fact wegan's description of the onsite team reminds me extremely closely of an enigmatic brutal

48:58.400 --> 49:05.840
and perplexing ufo crash recovery case i have covered before in extreme detail the 1974 koyame

49:05.840 --> 49:11.520
mexico ufo crash retrieval this case has very little in the form of evidence-based paper trails

49:11.520 --> 49:17.280
but outlines an incredible and logical crash retrieval encounter in this case us intelligence

49:17.280 --> 49:23.520
agencies specifically the cia monitored a ufo from the gulf of mexico that after a series of jagged

49:23.520 --> 49:29.280
and abrupt turns crashed into the northern chihuahua part of mexico according to the primary

49:29.280 --> 49:35.200
source document of this case the allegedly leaked deneve report the cia mobilized a rapid recovery

49:35.200 --> 49:41.360
unit out of fort blitz texas this team arrived onsite from four unmarked helicopters including

49:41.360 --> 49:48.560
uh1 huys and ch53 superstallions equipped with hazmat gear hazmat or mop gear was required at

49:48.560 --> 49:53.200
this crash site according to the deneve report because of a whole containment breach of toxic

49:53.280 --> 49:59.440
materials gas or liquid out of the ufo that subsequently killed the mexican military retrieval

49:59.440 --> 50:04.800
team there is of course an argument the us rapid recovery team killed these mexican soldiers but

50:04.800 --> 50:11.920
that is not our topic let's remain in 1974 to attempt to uncover the origins of this doe team

50:11.920 --> 50:17.520
this year saw the creation of the department of energy and national nuclear security administrations

50:17.520 --> 50:25.120
nuclear emergency support team formerly known as the nuclear emergency search team aka nest

50:25.120 --> 50:30.560
previously i have labeled nest as the onsite retrieval science team wey gantt encountered

50:30.560 --> 50:37.760
in the jungles of peru in 1997 just like other excellent researchers like rgh ufo's did before

50:37.760 --> 50:44.000
me today however i have even stronger conviction nest handled the recovery of a non-human vehicle

50:44.000 --> 50:50.080
and hazardous containment breach of a mysterious liquid suffered by a young marine during operation

50:50.080 --> 50:57.360
laser strike but what is this nest nest or nuclear emergency support team was created under executive

50:57.360 --> 51:05.200
order 12656 nest was founded as a doe specialized nuclear emergency organization that assisted the

51:05.200 --> 51:11.040
fbi and numerous government agencies by quote providing technical expertise and advice in

51:11.040 --> 51:16.720
response to a variety of potential incident threats involving nuclear materials end quote

51:16.720 --> 51:22.560
analyzing a 1996 nest briefing the closest available document to the time of our crash

51:22.560 --> 51:28.160
nest engaged in myriad deployment activities serving as an operational emergency management

51:28.160 --> 51:34.160
team or oemt and also as a threat credibility assessor ensuring nest was the quote unquote

51:34.160 --> 51:40.880
initial party to the scene on mission deployment sites nest would restrict access perform diagnostics

51:40.880 --> 51:46.240
and threat mitigation actions agency planning and coordination as well as handle disablement

51:46.240 --> 51:53.120
and cleanup in short nest operated as an umbrella organization to handle all nuclear and radiological

51:53.120 --> 51:58.640
emergencies for the department of energy the mission of nest is to be quote prepared to respond

51:58.640 --> 52:05.120
immediately to any type of radiological accident or incident anywhere in the world end quote around

52:05.120 --> 52:13.520
1996 nest enjoyed its own arsenal of vehicles including high-tech vans mbb bo 105 helicopters

52:13.520 --> 52:20.880
and numerous jets including sesna citation twos that featured a max speed of 464 miles per hour

52:20.880 --> 52:26.480
and remember that speed as it will become quite important later on now it is crucial to mention

52:26.480 --> 52:32.640
nest personnel did not consist of armed operators therefore it is safe to assume the operators

52:32.640 --> 52:38.880
in black camis were not nest operators though it is possible they were still doe assets we will

52:38.880 --> 52:46.240
get to that soon personnel in nest circa 1996 included chemists engineers health physicists

52:46.240 --> 52:52.160
management and logistics personnel nuclear physicists analysts etc the corporate team

52:52.160 --> 52:57.920
members of the nuclear emergency support team consisted of some familiar faces to this channel

52:57.920 --> 53:03.680
nest forces have historically been comprised of contractors rather than the department of defense

53:03.680 --> 53:11.040
not only did nest partner with raytheon but also e g and g los alamos national labs sandia national

53:11.040 --> 53:16.880
labs and laurence livermore national labs as we discussed earlier a cornerstone of my work is

53:16.880 --> 53:22.880
discussing the missing link of u.s. government corporate ufo legacy programs the subject matter

53:22.960 --> 53:29.120
expert federally funded research and development centers or ffr dcs alongside institutions like

53:29.120 --> 53:35.280
the mitre corporation rand corporation center for naval analyses los alamos sandia and laurence

53:35.280 --> 53:42.080
livermore national labs operate as ffr dcs for the u.s. department of defense sandia and laurence

53:42.080 --> 53:48.080
livermore were also directly accused by usaff master sergeant edgar fuchsia as engineering the

53:48.080 --> 53:54.240
propulsion devices from the reverse engineered triangular craft the tr 3b i've also discussed

53:54.240 --> 54:01.040
sandia national labs as implicated in ufo technology transfer with at and t and bell labs as well as

54:01.040 --> 54:07.280
serving as a ufo legacy program location to house craft and biologics has outlined in the disputed

54:07.280 --> 54:12.720
majestic 12 and interplanetary phenomenon unit documents and a quick side note while these

54:12.720 --> 54:18.000
documents i just mentioned may be disputed the interplanetary phenomenon unit was proven to

54:18.080 --> 54:24.160
exist through foyer requests done by ufo researcher william steinman in the 1980s however according

54:24.160 --> 54:30.080
to the army no records of this unit existed due to it existing only through institutional memory

54:30.080 --> 54:36.160
los alamos sandia and laurence livermore are labs intimately entwined with ufo lore quite

54:36.160 --> 54:41.760
recently i discussed provable subterranean facilities existing below sandia and los alamos

54:41.760 --> 54:47.600
and their possible connection to ufo legacy programs and one of nest partners e g and g

54:47.600 --> 54:53.040
really needs no introduction this former contractor is infamous in ufo lore serving as

54:53.040 --> 54:58.800
the contractor bob lasar claimed employed him to attempt to reverse engineer ufo propulsion devices

54:58.800 --> 55:04.960
at area 51 s4 and e g and g's nevada parking lot also served as the meeting place for the

55:04.960 --> 55:11.440
disputed but likely accurate 2002 wilson davis meeting notes funny enough nest themselves

55:11.440 --> 55:17.760
in a 1995 nest assessment team report stated quote the laboratory program managers enjoy a

55:17.760 --> 55:23.120
relatively high degree of autonomy and independence with respect to focusing efforts and funding

55:23.120 --> 55:28.240
on those elements of their internal programs which they have deemed to be the most important

55:28.240 --> 55:33.440
end quote this intriguing and free management style around nest laboratories arose from the

55:33.440 --> 55:38.640
laboratory's heavy focus on research and development activities during formative years

55:38.720 --> 55:46.080
under executive order 12656 which created nest the primary authority to nest was the 1954

55:46.080 --> 55:52.720
atomic energy act mention of the atomic energy commission's atomic energy act of 1954 should

55:52.720 --> 55:59.200
immediately set off alarm bells this 1954 act has been labeled specifically in the schumer

55:59.200 --> 56:05.840
rounds legislation as a system for misclassifying ufo data and materials historically misclassifying

56:05.840 --> 56:12.480
them as trans classified foreign nuclear information or by the acronym tfni whether the

56:12.480 --> 56:18.320
ufo wagon encountered emitted signs of radiological signatures when tracked by laser strike radar

56:18.320 --> 56:24.320
or intelligence agency radars matters not as ufo materials have historically been hidden within

56:24.320 --> 56:31.200
the exact 1954 act that provided oversight to nest however it is indeed possible this craft

56:31.200 --> 56:37.200
emitted signatures of interest to attract the eyes of the doe recently i covered a 1991 deep

56:37.200 --> 56:43.440
sea ufo retrieval case in which a triangular craft that had sat on the sea for 30 or 40 years was

56:43.440 --> 56:49.840
recovered by a naval dsrv crew due to survey ships recognizing radioactive signatures from the sea

56:49.840 --> 56:56.720
floor further intriguing links exist between jonathan's testimony and nest in february of 1997

56:56.720 --> 57:03.440
just one to two months before wagans encounter nest introduced the jtot or joint technical

57:03.440 --> 57:09.440
operations team this team aimed to provide deployable and technical operational support for nest to

57:09.440 --> 57:17.600
do d at even faster speeds than present nest teams and this team operated 365 days a year at 24 hours

57:17.600 --> 57:24.080
a day let's reference diffusing armageddon inside nest america's secret nuclear bomb squad by author

57:24.080 --> 57:30.400
jeffrey t richelson the same author of the us intelligence community that provided extremely

57:30.400 --> 57:36.960
valuable information on the national underwater reconnaissance office around 1997 russia blasted

57:36.960 --> 57:43.680
a probe from the bay kanor cosmodrome in kazakhstan carrying the mars 96 probe the fourth stage of this

57:43.680 --> 57:50.320
proton rocket failed leaving the rocket unable to escape earth mars 96 did not carry an onboard

57:50.400 --> 57:57.520
nuclear reactor but did in fact carry 18 small energy generators powered by plutonium 238 but

57:57.520 --> 58:03.120
this was enough to get nest's attention us space command estimated the probe was large enough some

58:03.120 --> 58:08.560
pieces would survive re-entry and the unlucky countries of origin were estimated to be bolivia

58:08.560 --> 58:14.640
or columbia nest debated deployment to bolivia or columbia two countries considered quote-unquote

58:14.640 --> 58:20.880
not very important but ceased action once surviving debris landed west of south america in the pacific

58:20.880 --> 58:26.160
ocean what is interesting here is that the same year as wagans encounter nest considered deployment

58:26.160 --> 58:31.680
to recover a probe in country's neighboring peru nest acted off intelligence gathered from us

58:31.680 --> 58:38.640
space command and their defense support program dsp satellites and now i have made an entire video

58:38.640 --> 58:44.960
on the subject of fast walkers a term used by us north com and norad to designate any strange

58:44.960 --> 58:51.360
object leaving or entering earth's atmosphere at incredible speeds in the 2016 hillary clinton

58:51.360 --> 58:57.120
campaign leaks communications were found between clinton campaign manager john pedesta and usg

58:57.120 --> 59:03.360
contractor bob fish in these exchanges fish stated quote one of the government programs that collects

59:03.440 --> 59:10.640
hard data on unidentified flying objects is the usaf dsp satellite program end quote in the same

59:10.640 --> 59:16.000
video i covered an incredible dsp fast walker case related to journalist and former army

59:16.000 --> 59:23.120
criminal investigation command agent joseph stifula this case allegedly saw a ufo traveling at 22

59:23.120 --> 59:30.720
thousand miles per hour towards earth pass within 1.5 miles of a dsp satellite before changing course

59:30.720 --> 59:36.800
and by the way guess which us agency has a history of developing and managing dsp satellites

59:36.800 --> 59:42.080
yes the nr o or national reconnaissance office remember from numerous projects of mine and the

59:42.080 --> 59:48.320
incredible articles of chris sharp the nr o has been labeled time and time again as a big five

59:48.320 --> 59:53.840
us intelligence agency that provides various forms of satellite intelligence for ufo domestic

59:53.840 --> 59:59.280
and foreign crash retrieval incidents all this out of jeffrey t richelson's work is to say that

59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.960
there are provable instances of dsp satellites and nest working in conjunction the same year as

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.560
wagan's testimony to cover debris in south america i think for wagan's case it is highly

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:17.120
likely the nr o managed dsp satellites monitoring the egg-shaped crafts crashing in peru and deployed

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.360
a nest rapid recovery unit to secure the site what strengthens this thesis even more is the fact

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.880
wagan himself mentioned a bunker below the laser strike radar station that was tracking ufo's

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.000
as we discussed while performing perimeter security wagan would state how he overheard

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.240
usaff personnel discussing aircraft flying in and out of atmosphere at mock 10 plus or almost

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:49.360
7700 miles per hour also recall how wagan mentioned us army ch-47s deploying the doe team in a

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.920
declassified 1995 nest assessment team report we can see the doe ensured with the department of

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.440
defense that suitable military aircraft would be made immediately available to support an emergency

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:07.520
deployment of nest forces and equipment nest also worked closely with the us naval explosive

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.760
ordinance disposal technology division in us army 52nd ordinance group it is possible in this

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:20.320
instance the ch-47 belonged to nest army partners indeed the us army south did begin supporting

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:27.840
counter-drug operations in south america in 1995 by providing aircraft such as for uh-60a or black

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:34.640
hawks for such operations until one november 1997 but what i think here is that it's quite probable

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:42.000
these army ch-47s used to transport the nest team were from the first battalion 228th aviation regiment

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.360
one 228th aviation is part of joint task force bravo a us south com forward-based expeditionary

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.880
task force operating to promote stability and security by countering transnational threats

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.960
including narco traffic throughout the 90s jtf bravo conducted numerous missions in central

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.640
and south america and saw the us army 7th special forces we discussed earlier work alongside the

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:14.240
128th aviation in support of the peru ecuador 1995 border disputes and interestingly enough

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.240
throughout the 90s one 228th aviation had headquartered in panama in honduras and featured a

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.960
fleet of helicopters including ch-47 chinooks i do need to quickly mention we are faced with an

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.320
additional possibility of the origin of these helicopters as we move on to discuss the black

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.720
operators and us special forces we must also discuss the 160th special operations aviation

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.640
regiment a us army special forces special mission unit that provides helicopter aviation support

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:51.120
for special operations forces nickname the night stalkers the 160th often works with joint special

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.640
operations command the night stalkers are some of the army's greatest qualified aviators crew

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:02.720
chiefs and support soldiers and employ a massive fleet of helicopters including numerous ch-47

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.440
chinooks the night stalkers have even deployed on several missions of interest here including

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.440
recovering a down soviet helicopter in june of 1988 now there is no record of the night stalkers

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.360
performing operations in south america during the 1990s in fact closest we can get is deployment

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:25.680
out of panama for operation desert storm in 91 obviously with special forces operations there

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.600
would likely be next to no record of covert activities by the 160th sor in the region but

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:38.480
the reason i suspect the 128th aviation from jtf bravo ch-47 chinooks were used over the highly

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:45.120
qualified special operations force the night stalkers is because of provable ch-47s existing

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:50.960
under the 128th aviation and south coms domain at the time of our crash retrieval incident the

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.840
night stalkers are stationed out of fort camble kentucky and it is technically impossible for the

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.640
team to have flown chinooks to peru and commence the operation in the roughly nine hours we

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.240
outlined for the doe team but this is all to say it is very possible elements of the night

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.080
stalkers were stationed in south coms domain as part of a ufo rapid recovery team especially if

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:18.080
laser strike had already monitored numerous ufos but for now we are forced to look at provable

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.880
existing vehicles in the region that would satisfy the retrieval operation and now this

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.560
brings us to the armed men in black camis with no insignia i do think we are faced with a few

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.640
possibilities here in the same 1995 nest assessment team report we can see nest additionally

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:40.880
worked alongside us special operations and us navy special operations i have often spoke and

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.160
reflected on the work of excellent journalist chris sharp exposing the cia's office of global

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.240
access born in 2003 out of the cia directorate of science and technology the office of global

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:58.960
access or oga was accused by sharp as participating in foreign ufo crash recovery operations while

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.960
oga provided operational logistics and intelligence agencies provided various forms of intelligence

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.320
sharp labeled jsoc or joint special operations command as serving as the boots on the ground

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.680
force for such retrieval operations and as we discussed earlier joint special operations

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.840
command is a subordinate command within special operations command sharp myself and others have

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:28.640
accused jsoc in the socom as participating directly in ufo crash retrievals interestingly

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:35.440
jsoc is comprised of the best of the best of us special forces delta for seal team six the 24th

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.880
sts regimental reconnaissance company and the intelligence support activity the shadowy

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:47.040
intelligence support activity is often known as the most mysterious unit of jsoc task force orange

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:53.120
as it sometimes referred to was originally created under us army inscom or intelligence and security

01:05:53.120 --> 01:06:00.320
command us army inscom was created under general albert stubblebine a figure famous in ufo lore

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.680
stubblebine showed keen interest in utilizing psi phenomena such as remote viewing for military

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.880
usage and has also been accused by numerous individuals such as philip j corso and steven

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:17.920
as participating directly in ufo legacy program operations at fort hachuka arizona all this is

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:24.320
to say i do think it is highly likely wegan encountered unmarked socom or jsoc units alongside

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.480
the doenest team the question here is were these units currently stationed in peru for laser strike

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:36.720
or deployed rapidly from a base similar to the doenest crew this is up for debate but i do have

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:42.560
my own strong thesis here let's break this down wegan did state during his deployment performing

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:47.600
perimeter security for laser strike he did encounter special forces operators training

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:54.000
as a matter of fact us special forces were deployed to peru during this time let us analyze in 1996

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.160
to 1997 document pulled from the defense technical information center titled the us military and drug

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:06.320
war in peru as we mentioned earlier this document details 14 special forces counter drug deployments

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:13.040
to peru conducted by us south com or us southern command these forces would regularly engage in

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:18.960
riverine training as it turns out and this will become extremely important soon us south com held

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:25.440
the mar forlant marine forces atlantic riverine training team in iqitos peru for utilization

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.440
under operation laser strike iqitos is a host to all sorts of us military installations of

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:38.080
interest we will touch on soon circling back there is the south com unit deployed to peru in 1997

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:44.880
we discussed earlier i highly suspect did indeed intercept wegan and his fellow marines and secured

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:53.200
a ufo crash site these being the us army seventh special forces unit aka the us army green berets

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.400
due to their consistent execution of us south com missions including a historical presence

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:04.240
training encountering narcotic distribution in central and south america especially in northern

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:11.040
peru i wager here the army seventh special forces were quote-unquote recruited by doe nest to serve

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:17.200
as the enforcement arm of a ufo crash retrieval operation now there is a secondary argument here

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:23.440
of who these operators could be far less likely in my opinion but still worth exploring this being

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:30.080
the department of energy special response team these anti-nuclear terrorist teams are the doe's

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:36.320
own elite task force an elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.160
the continental united states the special response team has a rest on site authority and at least

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:48.640
in the 1980s dawned all black camis similar to the outfits described by wagan historically in the

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:55.920
late 90s doe srt units also provided security for sensitive doe defense nuclear facilities

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.760
including low salamos national labs and laurence livermore national labs sound familiar these

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.600
teams were trained by wacken hut wacken hut was a private security company i have talked about

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.520
extensively had historically guarded usa legacy program sites through their industrial security

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.680
expertise former cia director and director of naval intelligence admiral bobby ray inman

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.800
who admitted to nasa mission specialist bob eschler recovered ufos may one day become

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.640
available for scientific research once served as chairman of wacken hut while i can find no

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.200
data to suggest doe srt's have ever operated outside of the united states it stands to reason

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.560
such a team could travel with nest assets to incredibly sensitive materials such as a crashed

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.200
ufo protected by the 1954 atomic energy agreement act

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.120
after all our investigation into the team with delta oscar echo on their protection

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.840
suits and rain jackets as well as the armed anonymous americans and black camis i think

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.680
we can construct a powerful thesis us forces engaged in counter narcotics reconnaissance

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.840
systems for operation laser strike monitored a ufo in addition to radar it is likely the

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.760
defense support program satellites run by the nr o either picked up the same ufo or elements of

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.920
laser strike were also involved with the defense support program the ufo then crashed in wagan's

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.440
estimate this crash was caused as we discussed earlier by peruvian air force surface to air hawk

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.960
missile batteries from data gathered by intelligent sources likely dsp with support from the nr o a

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:45.600
doe nest retrieval team was dispatched via internal nest jet assets with a point of origin in the

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:51.120
mainland united states the southern most nest facility here is sandia national labs in new

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:57.680
mexico the nest team either departed with a doe special response team srt or leveraged green

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.920
beret special forces assets to provide on-site protection for securing the crash zone nest also

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:10.960
leveraged per their dod authority several us army ch47 chinooks from either the 160th soar

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:18.640
night stalkers or one 228th aviation from jtf bravo station nearby in us south com territory

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.000
during the crash recovery and deployment of on-site directives nest and the first to arrived armed

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.440
entourage encountered a group of marines that had happened upon the crash site first one marine

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.800
resisted detainment and was confined due to coming in contact with possibly hazardous materials

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.320
leaking from the non-human craft the young marine was stripped of his contaminated clothes by nest

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:46.320
personnel in biohazard suits isolated from his fellow marines and taken to a secure base with

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:52.400
medical facilities for quarantine interrogation and debrief the mac g28 marine was held in

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.440
isolation for up to 48 hours threatened repeatedly and forced under fear of death to sign confidentiality

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.640
agreements the marine was then driven back to his operational base where he was soon forced to

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.160
return to cherry point north carolina okay now that we have outlined our thesis let's step

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:16.160
back and explore this piece by piece we must start by analyzing where exactly was jonathan

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.760
wagon stationed and where may of this crash occurred operation laser strike was conducted

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.840
primarily in puculpa peru however there were two secondary locations that supported operation

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:34.400
laser strike and peruvian counter drug operations while also featuring tps 43 radar systems within

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.480
iqitos and andoas many familiar with the case of wagon believes he was stationed at puculpa

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.680
the primary laser strike facility and while this is indeed possible i would like to propose a

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.200
secondary possible station elements of laser strike are still classified to this day and i

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.640
know this because i've spoken to one of the marines wagon described he was with in his testimony

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.280
the marine refused to discuss many details of laser strike with me since the operation was

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.200
still classified to me this partially rules out puculpa as the base at which jonathan

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:14.240
alan adkins and others were stationed but why puculpa at least since 2001 has received public

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.680
as a laser strike location one of the marines i talked to his unwillingness to speak about

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:25.600
their base of operations leads me to believe it was not puculpa furthermore wagon stated his unit

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.920
flew into lima peru via c 130 then took a multiple hour flight with one stop to travel to their

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:38.480
operational base jonathan was unaware of where exactly this location was and puculpa is around

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.640
300 miles from lima at the cruise speed of a c 130 this journey from lima to puculpa would take

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:50.240
less than one hour however there was a laser strike location up north in peru that existed

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:57.200
more than 630 miles away from lima at a cruising speed a c 130 would take near two hours to complete

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.440
this journey with an added stop this satisfies our journey conditions of several hours this laser

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.400
strike location is usaf detachment five in iqitos peru detachment five is a very private

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:17.040
installation i can only find one mention of in the 1990s or onward iqitos is home to usaf radar

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.200
detachment five the mar forlant riverine training team discussed earlier in namru six now called

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:29.840
namru south aka the navy medical research unit all three of these locations significance will

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.760
become apparent very soon especially when wegan't discuss the facility he was taken to by the doe

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:41.680
team and the permanent structures there on site now i can find next to no information about the

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:48.080
andoas laser strike site but these aforementioned locations at iqitos lead me strongly to believe

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:54.160
iqitos is the correct location wegan't stated his radar station was tracking narcotics traffic from

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.400
analyzing narco routes from 1998 we can see drug transport routes passing directly through

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.080
iqitos peru but let's go step by step through the incident and try to reconstruct wegan't's

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.000
encounter jonathan was informed of a crashed aircraft near 11 p.m to midnight by three to four

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.360
a.m the lance corporal sergeant adkins sergeant allen's and multiple marines and humvees departed

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.640
for the crash area after a combination of driving and trekking the marines reached the crash area

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.720
as the sun was rising around six to seven a.m what this means is that from the time the marines

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.000
left their base of operations which i highly suspect is the enigmatic usaff radar detachment

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.480
five in iqitos peru to the time the marines got to the crash only between two and four hours had

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.080
elapsed but let's break this down remember wegan't claimed the marines drove humvees and

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.960
trekked to the crash area wegan't would also make mention that while he was analyzing the craft

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.880
up close he was incredibly sweaty but made no mention of fatigue due to the hiking while a

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.600
marine equipped with a full loadout and weapon would certainly get quite sweaty quickly in the

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.840
peruvian air average temperatures in march and peru are only 77 degrees fahrenheit with a sunrise

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.120
temp being much cooler due to these factors we will take the average time elapsed to the crash

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.800
site three hours and assume the marines drove for two and a half hours and trekked for 30 minutes

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:24.160
humvees drive at max speeds of 70 miles per hour but operate conservatively especially on

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:30.400
jungle terrain and roads therefore we will assume the caravan of marines traveled at 35 miles per

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.680
hour at two and a half hours of driving this means if the marines traveled in a straight line the

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.680
soldiers could have traveled near 88 miles the average human hikes at roughly two to three miles

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.880
per hour and we will assume here trained soldiers who got a pep in their step could trekk two miles

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:52.480
in 30 minutes with this information and a tremendous amount of error and i fully understand my

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.240
calculations are based on heavy assumptions we can assume the crash occurred in a 90 mile radius

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:04.400
outside of iquitos to try and correct for some of my error here i will give a plus minus of 25

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.840
percent error we are then left with this general area of where the crash may have occurred now

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.280
recall wegan did say the crash occurred just over the border but he stated the bolivian borders

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.880
specifically 5 to 10 miles from the bolivian border now if wegan's testimony is true this

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.840
means he either got the border of bolivia incorrect confusing the country with the borders of either

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.840
brazil or columbia or he was stationed at a secretive location in southeast peru that featured

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.800
multiple camps and permanent structures now i tend to believe the former and that jonathan

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.080
misspoke as his laser strike installation was tasked with tracking bolivian narco traffic

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.320
and iquitos employed a significant amount of us do d permanent structures and assets that line up

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.760
with jonathan's testimony and the timeline of events what reinforces this thesis is the point

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.120
we discussed earlier that the us army seventh special forces and joint task force bravo containing

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.960
the first battalion 228th aviation regiment had historically conducted us south com missions in

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:11.680
northern peru during the 1955 peru ecuador border dispute so it is interesting the men in black

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:17.120
camis i wager where us army seven special forces were already available to secure the crash site

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.880
in northern peru anyways we can conclude from the exploration above wegan adkins and the fellow

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.640
marines uncovered the crashed ufo 5 to 10 miles from either the columbian or brazilian border

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.160
in one of these two general regions within 15 to 20 minutes the marines arriving the crash

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:40.080
site was secured by multiple us army ch-47 helicopters doe personnel and armed men in

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.160
black camis wagantis certain arrived to the scene before the ch-47s it was almost like they were

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:53.920
there already they were on the ground already and and whoever was flying over was coming in after

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.360
they these guys had landed so i'm and i'm not sure where they landed where they were but they

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:05.680
were just there on top of the site within a few minutes i can't remember exactly how it's speculation

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.720
on your part you don't know for sure but you think it's possible that team may have been there first

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.600
yeah they all they were definitely there first and they were monitoring us too i'm sure they knew

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.840
we were in the area when we got up there near it but they looked army but they didn't have you

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:23.360
know insignia on them right they were same color and all this from the data we've discussed above

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.800
an involvement of nr row managed dsp satellites i wager this rapid reaction retrieval team had

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:34.560
maybe one hour advanced notice of the crash to the marines therefore let's assume this retrieval

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.920
team had a maximum of nine hours to gather intelligence assemble brief and reach the crash

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.920
site with a detailed operational plan remember at this time nes teams were historically stationed

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.600
at us department of energy laboratories so i think it is extremely unlikely any team would have

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.880
been stationed in south america at this time in this instance one of the closest major labs to

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:03.440
iqitos peru is a regular tricky customer of this channel central new mexico's sandia national labs

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.960
and recall back to discussing nest in the 1996 nest briefing nest was not only permitted to

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.800
commandeer any do d assets but also employed their own fleet of vehicles including sesna citation

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.880
two jets so my theory here would see a nest team departing sandia heading directly to iqitos u.s

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:27.200
military infrastructure via sesna citation two jets from iqitos or nearby south com installations

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.880
the team would commandeer us ch 47 helicopters likely from joint task force bravo and recruit

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:39.280
nearby special forces from the riverine training team or utilize a jsocker does rt team that traveled

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:45.200
with the nest team sandia's nearby largest city is santa fe new mexico and using santa fe as a

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:52.640
reference point travel distance to iqitos is 3446 miles a sesna citation two travels at

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.720
top speed of 464 miles per hour logically assuming the team wished to arrive to the retrieval site

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:04.160
with haste this flight would have taken around seven and a half hours from iqitos the team would

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:10.880
have a very short flight to arrive to the crash area around 90 to 100 miles away in a ch 47 that

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:17.680
travels 180 to 196 miles per hour at top speed so this journey here on the shorter end would have

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:23.520
taken roughly 30 minutes this means the nest team would have only required around eight hours total

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:28.800
of travel time with roughly one hour left for personnel and gear gathering necessary ground

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.560
briefings etc a tight squeeze but one that very well fits in the framework of wegan's testimony

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:40.400
and then they took me in the ch 47 and they they sent me to we we took off and

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:46.080
and uh and uh they they didn't drug me or anything like that and i was just awake there

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:53.360
and and they had me in a uh your question again is how long was i contained your subdued i don't

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.240
know for about two days i think i don't know no i don't i don't know they i didn't know where i was

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:07.680
because we landed and um we we we we flew and then we landed and then uh they took me out and

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.800
it was still i mean you know it's it wasn't in the same area that i was at this is more of like

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.640
there were structures prominent structures there i think was peruvian military but all this thing

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:24.320
man all i saw there was americans and there's a lot of other nationalities there are chinese

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.760
germans i think were there i mean a lot of other people weren't at this other base

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:33.440
but i mean this thing was really i mean i didn't go in and all they did was take me to like uh

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:40.000
like us you couldn't tell it itself was more of like uh it was more like an interrogation

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.840
but i sat in there for how long they had 15 hours land's corporal wegan was isolated from adkins

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.960
allen and the other marines he was flown to a location that was not his base of operations

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.800
which i wager was in iqitos now what's interesting is this location was close enough to his original

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.920
station that after one to two days of captivity wegan was driven back before being kept with

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:07.600
usaf personnel for three weeks another nod towards iqitos being the correct location with usaf

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:13.200
detachment five before being shipped back to cherry point at this interrogation room wegan was

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.400
contained isolated and threatened by some of the operators and black camis and was then forced to

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:24.000
sign documents swearing his silence by a usaf colonel describing this location wegan made a

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.960
very interesting set of remarks the location at which he was interrogated employed permanent

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:34.320
structures not makeshift forward operating bases like pulcapa laser strike location

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.560
it was at this base where he was interrogated he observed multiple different nationalities

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:45.680
in one area americans peruvians chinese and germans also recall twice wegan got the mysterious

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.560
liquid leaking from the craft on him once during his initial investigation of the crash site in a

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.840
second time when the black operators forcefully took him to the ground wegan also stated here the

01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:01.520
doe team and hazmat gear stripped his clothes covered in the liquid due to these statements plus

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:07.760
wegan being isolated from adkins and allen i do think it likely the doe nest team had concerns

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:13.680
wegan was contaminated from interacting with the liquid for this reason i do have high suspicion

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:20.480
wegan was taken to namru 6 or namru south the navy medical research unit with offices in lima

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.280
peru and ikitos the us navy employs various namru locations around the globe which serve as dod

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:34.320
laboratories and centers namru sa at joint base san antonio texas namru 3 formally in egypt now

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:41.040
in siginella naval air station sicily italy namru endo pacific in singapore naval base namru south

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.880
with offices in lima and ikitos peru and namru d at right patterson air force base ohio

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.800
namru locations absolutely fit the dictionary definition of multicultural environments

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.560
namru installations serve as a network of biomedical research labs operated by the us navy

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:04.000
namru operates to conduct r&d on infectious diseases bio defense and numerous medical

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.680
topics related to military and public health namru is part of the navy medical research command

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.200
that conducts biomedical research to meet the needs of the navy and marine corps german

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:21.600
nationalists that specifically namru south are also not uncommon even in 2023 we can find examples

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.520
of german military and ambassadors visiting namru's lima location in my opinion namru would

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:33.200
serve as a perfect location for jonathan to be taken this location is within driving distance to

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.840
ikitos usaf detachment 5 and close to the us marfor lint riverine training team and obviously

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.520
this location is a sensible holding in quarantine zone for a us marine who is exposed to possibly

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:51.440
toxic materials in non-human craft now i do need to mention of course this theory is not

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:57.040
without its own kinks wegan stated he was only at this location for two days and while he was

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.480
contained in an interrogation type room he was still in close proximity to the usaf lieutenant

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.760
colonel that forced him to sign papers in the operator who threatened his life one might assume

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.240
wegan would have had to be quarantined for up to a week in isolation and would have had to undergo

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.600
numerous medical procedures to determine if any risk of sickness or contamination resided from the

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.680
fluid and wegan did specifically tell me he did not have to undergo any sort of medical procedures

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.360
at this location other factors at play do need to be worked through for this namru theory such as

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:35.120
the multi-nationals jonathan described being armed operators and not diplomats as well as this

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:41.200
holding location being underground remember this crash occurring near ikitos is just a theory of

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:47.040
mind constructed from the best available evidence for this crash retrieval testimony but even so

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.640
i do believe ikitos peru serves as the primary focus for our ufo crash retrieval and forced

01:26:52.640 --> 01:27:03.600
holding of lance corporal jonathan wegan i have contacted countless individuals named by wegan

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:09.120
are possibly involved in this crash retrieval case these include multiple usaf personnel from

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:14.640
my keto's detachment five including lieutenant colonel gala biles second lieutenant randall

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:21.440
rothman and staff sergeant robert mcowd of the 649th combat logistics support squadron this outreach

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:27.200
was conducted in an attempt to identify if ikitos was indeed where wegan was stationed i plan to

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.520
inquire if us marines from the mac g28 performed perimeter security for the site if a doe team

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.320
ever stationed briefly at detachment five or borrowed their aircraft or if stories floated

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.240
around of a marine who went missing that turned up two days later as of today i have had no luck

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:50.240
contacting any usaf personnel involved in laser strike due to repeatedly hearing that some details

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.840
of the op are still classified i am not holding my breath however i will continue to pursue any and

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.840
all leads jonathan wegan did directly state a staff sergeant montaligre knew about the crash

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.120
site and that sergeant allen and sergeant adkins had both accompanied wegan to the site and observed

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:15.200
the crash day with 100 confidence i have identified all three of these men and all three are real usmc

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.960
veterans and enjoyed long accomplished careers with the corps after laser strike and i reached

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.480
out to all three on multiple platforms and as of this date only one marine has responded i choose

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:31.280
to keep the identity of this marine anonymous out of respect to the individual and to his service

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.640
to the united states i will also refrain from posting screenshots as i do not wish to break

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.760
this individual's trust nor do i have his permission to do so i reached out to these marines from

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.000
this channel's email address uapgerb at gmail.com which i highly encourage any first hand ufo legacy

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.880
program witnesses to contact this email does not contain my identity to protect my anonymity i emailed

01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:01.040
one of these sergeants asking to talk to him about his service during laser strike in 1996 to 1997

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:06.800
i did also state that my outreach concerned an encounter relayed by a mac g28 lance corporal

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.320
but with held wegan's name who claimed he alongside a handful of sergeants encountered a unique

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:19.520
downed aircraft the sergeant responded hello and addressed me gerb by both my first and my last

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:25.360
name in this exchange the sergeant continued quote the operation is still classified however

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.080
there was no incident involving a unique downed aircraft that i know of or encountered during

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.080
my deployment i can speak to what never happened during my deployment and not cross the classification

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.040
restrictions of the operation and quote the sergeant reckoned i had received bad intel

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.320
regarding his involvement in the suggested incident i was pursuing i then asked the marine if he

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.800
had ever heard of a lance corporal's testimony of a crashed egg-shaped vehicle that involved

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:56.000
several other marines that may have been downed by human military assets such as hawk mim 23

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.000
missile batteries the marine responded he was aware of a lance corporal wegan that served under

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.440
his platoon much of this response by the sergeant focused on hawk surface to air missile systems

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:13.600
and the impossibility that the usmc employed a hawk battery during 1997 and of course wegan

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:19.360
does agree with this point hawk missile batteries were phased out of us forces in 1994 the marine

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.160
corps continued usage until 2002 but laser strike ceased usage of hawk in 1997 since his original

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.960
testimony wegan only theorized that this craft had been hit by a hawk system and that the missile

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:36.640
battery likely belonged to local peruvian forces and wegan held this theory due to the ballistic

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:42.160
and fragging pattern of damage on the egg-shaped craft wegan spent a tremendous amount of time

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.080
studying hawk mim 23 systems and maintains this conclusion to this day the sergeant not only

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:53.600
claimed wegan never deployed in support of operation laser strike but also stated wegan's story was

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:59.600
false and while he was a good young respectful obedient and dedicated marine he also suffered a

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:05.360
medical condition quote he was never a participant in any clandestine operations or efforts he was

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:11.520
just an laad marine and that was all end quote now let me be clear here i fully respect this

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.400
marine in question after all he dedicated much of his life to the service of this country but

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:21.520
i do have quite a few problems here with his statements jonathan wegan never once claimed

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:27.760
to participate in any clandestine operations this encounter simply involved a group of mac g28

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:33.840
marines sent out by their radar detachment to secure the lz of a downed aircraft the mac g28

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.760
marines in this testimony clearly conflicted with the clandestine mission of the do enes team

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:45.360
i also find the claims wegan never deployed to laser strike to be quite curious laser strike was

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.400
indeed a classified mission the marine i spoke to claimed wegan may have picked up bits and pieces

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.960
of deployment information for marines that did indeed deploy to laser strike but i find this

01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:00.720
unlikely in wegan's testimony and all the way back to his initial outreach to steven greer on one

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.960
august 2000 the young lance corporal described operation laser strike extremely accurately

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:12.160
and the only detail that stands out as odd is how jonathan claimed his usaf radar base was near

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:17.440
the bolivian border i still maintain he likely meant iqitos near the columbian and brazilian

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:24.480
borders mac g28 marines from jonathan's us station cherry point north carolina did absolutely

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.840
deploy to laser strike this is a fact i find it odd wegan would not have deployed with the other

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:35.520
mac g28 marines for perimeter defense and low altitude aerial defense to replace the obsolete

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.520
hawk batteries similar to hit pieces on david grush i also have a tremendous issue when claims of

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.720
witnesses or whistleblowers are dismissed because of quote unquote health conditions jonathan has

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:52.560
been playing this incident affected his life extremely negatively from the violent interrogation

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.280
to feeling like non-human beings were calling out for his help in the craft wreckage jonathan

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:03.360
did not leave this incident unscathed in the slightest i must interject my own personal biases

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:09.280
here but i am close friends with mr wegan the man enjoys a successful career and relationships

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.720
with friends family and loved ones as far as i can tell the man does not suffer from fanciful

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.600
delusions to construct such a specific fantasy

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.280
since the witness testimony of jake barber the concept of egg shaped ufo retrievals has

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:33.200
grown significantly in popularity while wegan described a much larger more intricate craft

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.640
with hatches a band of light along its circumference and what seems similar to gills over barber's

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:44.560
suv side smooth white egg we can find multiple retrieval cases from history that share numerous

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.640
similarities to the alleged crash in peru in 1997 let's reference the work done by legendary

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:57.200
ufo crash retrieval researcher lenard stringfield and visit ufo crash retrieval status report three

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:04.480
between 1980 and 1982 stringfield became aware of one hj a sergeant in the us army 24th infantry

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.800
who was wounded during service in the korean war in july of 1953 whilst a private and b company at

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:17.840
camp poke louisiana a 17-year-old private hj and his unit under command of one sergeant rs were

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.640
performing duty maneuvers at dusk at roughly 7 p.m. hj's platoon observed an object that was egg

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:30.960
shaped crash land out in the boondocks according to hj authorities as well as a and b companies

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.720
were ordered out to the crash site at the site hj got within 15 yards of the object before a

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:44.000
lieutenant witting ordered company b to withdraw to 100 yards stating quote unquote peons like hj

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.040
quote had to get out of the way and quote interestingly enough we can place an actual

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:54.720
lieutenant witting at camp poke at this time the area around the craft was badly burned turning

01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.960
nearby ground into a powdery substance like crushed brick and hj could still feel heat emanating

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.400
from the vehicle the craft was as wide as a three bedroom single story ranch house which by modern

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:12.640
standard estimates could be anywhere between 35 to 70 feet similarities here exist to wagons craft

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:19.360
estimates of 20 meters or roughly 66 feet the large ovoid object was without windows or lights and

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.440
quote was surrounded by a fin like protrusion on its equator which was still rotating end quote

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.320
another close similarity to wagons and discussion of a band of light traveling across the craft

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:36.640
circumference shortly after securing the site a special detachment medics an ambulance and special

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.760
equipment arrived on scene this detachment approached an open hatch on the side of the craft

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:47.680
after a while two medics carried away a stretcher to the ambulance containing a body three occupants

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:53.680
of the craft then emerged and were aided by medics seemingly injured hj would state quote one of them

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.320
kept looking at the one in the litter and made strange noises i couldn't believe what i was

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.320
seen end quote as incredible as this detail is we have discussed similar testimony before remember

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.520
back to the infographic show whistleblower testimony of a crash retrieval operator i put a lot of

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.120
stock into the witness in this program claimed in several ufo retrieval operations in which craft

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:20.880
were manned by biologics retrieval teams would often have to lead occupants out of the craft

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:26.240
these biologics were described seemingly as limited in cognitive ability possibly giving

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:32.640
some credence to the theory some ufo occupants are akin to biological androids that perform basic or

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.760
specific functions that night the two live ones apparently just kind of stood there as the team

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.000
entered the craft it had opened on its own maybe they opened the door i don't know if it was open

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.040
when we got there they stood there and they didn't answer the ambassador at all basically they just

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.000
barely reacted to anything just basic stimuli like turning their heads away from bright lights

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.560
they didn't even object when the medical team started looking them over for injuries or so i

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.680
was told i saw them when they were led out of the craft and i do mean they were let out like

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.040
children the medical guys grabbed them by the hand and just let them out like a kid they just sort

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:12.160
of stood where you left them hj described these occupants as three and a half to four feet tall

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:17.680
of slight build and walked as if they had no knees or very stiff bending only at the hips

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.200
hj described large heads without features leading him to believe the creatures were covered by a

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.680
helmet the biologics were a tight fitting dull metallic green uniform later on hj would somehow

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.520
learn that these biologics were sent to a hospital and quote unquote put into isolation but all died

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.440
in captivity he also learned the corpses were sent over to a medical center near washington dc

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:47.120
this could of course perhaps be the army's fort detrick roughly 40 miles away from dc at fort

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.400
detrick betel memorial institute manages the national biodefense analysis and countermeasures

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:59.200
center ffr dc i have previously implicated fort detrick alongside utah's dugway proving ground

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.640
in holding ufo biologics i highly recommend checking out my video on dugway to learn more

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:10.400
hj's experience at fort polk shares striking similarities to wagant but let's go even further

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.800
let's now jump to stringfield's 1991 ufo crash retrievals the inner sanctum status reports six

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.960
and investigate the case of barnabas aka albert bruce collins much of stringfield's work here

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.840
came from ufo researcher tim cooper one of the primary researchers who received significant

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.680
drops of majestic 12 documents in the 1980s also recall from my majestic 12 project with

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:39.600
author ryan wood how tim cooper's father usaff master sergeant harry b cooper received a special

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:46.160
citation from the legendary general entwined in ufo lore courtesy lemay this letter to tim cooper's

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:52.880
father from lemay praised harry b cooper for his work on the quote unquote usaff ufo program anyways

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:59.760
cooper interviewed barnabas aka albert bruce collins shortly before his 1990 new year's eve death on

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:06.080
20 november 1990 collins claimed to be a metallurgical engineer and retired government employee

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:11.120
specifically developing metal alloys used for electromagnetic propagation and magnetic field

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:17.840
propulsion from 1942 to the late 1950s and it is important to note i can't necessarily confirm

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:23.120
collins claims of an accomplished metallurgical engineering career while collins did in fact

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.040
die on 30 december 1990 all i can confirm from his obituary is he was a veteran a member of the

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:36.240
nra in a nature conservancy collins disclosed to cooper in 1947 he observed a ufo on a long

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.280
flatbed trailer covered with a green tarp being backed into a large warehouse at the university

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:47.200
of california berkeley i'm immediately reminded of us army lowboy trucks described in numerous

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:54.080
ufo retrieval cases such as the 1953 kingman crash and the 1965 kexburg pennsylvania crash

01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.080
according to collins he stood but just 100 feet away from an oval-shaped craft described like an

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:05.680
egg with the shell cracked and the yoke still inside the craft was metallic similar to polished

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:11.040
aluminum with a silvery looking finish similar to wagant's case this egg featured a seam at the

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.800
edge all the way around collins guessed this craft suffered an internal explosion with the metal

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.080
exterior of the craft seemingly pushed out the retrieval had sustained significant amounts of

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:27.840
damage with a large section ripped off in a huge gash on top running down the side below the seam

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.720
from his 100 foot away vantage point collins observed a bulkhead in front with multi-layered

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.400
honeycomb skin the interior was dark but similar to the egg analogy there was a shiny sphere in

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.040
the center of the craft surrounded by another bulkhead the craft additionally featured a

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:48.720
forward compartment but collins could not see inside the vehicle was 30 to 40 feet in diameter

01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:54.400
and roughly 15 feet high these dimensions are slightly smaller than the craft wagant described

01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.080
but why even mention this short story of collins with no supporting documentation or even verification

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.840
of his work history as a metallurgical engineer well this is because in his 1990 interview with

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:11.040
tim cooper collins additionally disclose some information that may just raise your eyebrow

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.320
not only did collins claim to have studied metal of unknown composition and origin in an official

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:22.880
capacity but also claimed at this time 1949 he learned of a multitude of agencies involved in

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.720
tuo or technologies of unknown origin research this included intelligence offices from the

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:36.000
u.s. army air force and navy the cia the rand corporation founded just one year prior in 1948

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.480
and the vatican collins even claimed to have learned of multiple projects between these agencies

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.160
archangel between the cia rand and vatican black book under the air force the infamous

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.760
blue book under the air force white book between the cia and vatican and yellow book which served

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:59.440
as a scientific panel of an unknown government scientific review board while discussing these

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:05.120
projects collins added he had heard los alamos national labs had been studying green fireballs

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.720
and strange debris found in the desert and this last piece of data is what lends credence to some

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.640
of collins words as the atomic energy commission did indeed create a project twinkle in the late

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:24.080
40s and early 50s that analyzed ufo's including green fireballs at los alamos sandia white sands

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.120
and hauleman air force base of course this isn't our topic for today but these joint

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.640
projects with the vatican are highly interesting i have covered this case before but let's briefly

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:41.120
circle back to the 1933 magenta italy ufo crash retrieval case according to the case as well as

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.000
david grush in the late herald malmgren vatican intelligence alerted the united states of the

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.560
lenticular disk in axis possession this in turn allowed the us to capture this ufo saucer post

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.480
world war two it's incredible to then consider joint u.s vatican ufo programs that followed world

01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:04.000
war two collins is quite the enigma and possibly in the future we will return to analyze further

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.200
claims of his included knowledge in project arc angel that determined some ufo occupants were

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:14.640
biological extraterrestrials there are many cases of egg shaped or tear drop shaped ufo

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.520
retrieval operations we just don't have the time to cover today i would also like to point to the

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:27.120
1973 great lake naval base rk testimony i covered in my previous naval ufo legacy programs project

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.800
in which gunnery school instructor rk observed a 30 foot long and 10 foot high tear drop shaped

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.160
ufo resting on a wooden platform in a quonset style hangar in the great lakes naval station

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:43.600
illinois this craft was allegedly shot down via a naval destroyer and picked up in the pacific

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:50.400
ocean by the national underwater reconnaissance officers glomar explorer hey guys it's grub and

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.520
i'd like to thank each and every single one of you for joining me on this very special investigation

01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:01.920
into lance corporal jonathan wagan now those of you new to my videos will now know one this is an

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.720
ai and two this is where after the video i kind of do an off script kind of rant if you want to

01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.800
call it and give my thoughts on the video give my thoughts on the investigation and kind of summarize

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.200
everything we've talked about returning viewers of this channel will probably know this is a very

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:21.280
special video as one of my first ever projects was on jonathan wagan but of course at that time

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.280
i didn't know jonathan i didn't have a relationship with him nor did i have the

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:30.560
investigative skills the video editing skills the research skills the writing skills to craft

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:38.400
such a project now originally the plan here was just to do an interview with wagan and so after

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:44.080
many months of knowing him and forming a friendship i went out to where he resides i'm not going to

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.320
go ahead and spill that but it's in the south as you can probably tell from his accent some of the

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.240
other accents we heard and i was fortunate enough to have my friend kermit uh frog and badger i've

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.760
had him on a live before right after the november 14 2024 hearings he was able to meet me out there

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.840
and help film and so forth so i want to give a huge shout out to him guys he's a great friend of

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.280
this channel i'd like to have him on some more lives uh he just on the drop of a pencil decided

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:14.240
to come up and help so huge shout out but this originally was planned to just be an interview

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:20.480
with wagan and as he and i started talking and as i started to sit with some of our conversations i

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:27.520
thought well maybe let's break this down a little bit and do a two-part series first wagan back in

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:35.120
2000 gave so much information really actionable information down to the does team due to names

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:41.280
and you guys know on this channel how much we love when names are given and in 2023 he offered

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:47.360
little new information so i thought why don't jonathan and i sit down and really iron out

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:52.720
some of the finer details of what he remembers because guys time is slipping away this incident

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.720
occurred according to jonathan in 1997 so we're pushing on 30 years here but i wanted to get some

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.480
of those details out and work out an investigation and then sit down and do an interview with jonathan

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.280
you guys know how i work i really want the firm foundation laid out before he and i sit down and

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:16.560
talk so i do plan on returning with him and kind of getting a more relaxed interview style of him

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.880
just speaking about his life speaking about his life before and after and so forth so that's

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:26.400
going to be coming down the pipeline but this project i thought it pertinent to to start digging

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.800
into some of the details with jonathan and then be able to do my own research and exploration

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.160
some of these added details included jonathan describing that the men in black kames where

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:42.480
they're on site first that was a huge question i had going into this whether uh to kind of ponder

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:49.680
if that team arrived on the ch-47s with the doe nest probably team or that they had arrived first

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:53.840
now the fact they arrived first according to jonathan gives even more credence to these were

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:58.480
local special forces now of course he didn't describe team any vehicles but in my opinion

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.920
the seventh army green berets probably utilized humbies or nearby vehicles to arrive on scene first

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:10.560
another key point here was the multinational group that these germans these chinese they were all

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:16.640
armed now that is a massive detail as well and one that i'm still trying to to solve here because

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:21.520
of course we've heard of multinational recovery team specifically with five eyes nations and

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.920
canadian politician larry maguire kind of writing to his own minister of defense in

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:31.280
canada saying we need to get information about uap because of five eyes projects and maybe retrieval

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:37.200
teams and another huge detail he talked about was him thinking the men in black camis were army

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:43.600
due to the helmets they had now if you're unfamiliar with military various factions of military army

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:50.160
marines navy all of their infantry and soldiers utilize different helmets so being able to track

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.880
down the helmets or kind of the caps they had wagon thought these guys were army and that's a huge

01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:01.360
detail to to try and track down i also really enjoyed him talking about mop gear and varying

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.800
levels of that and that gives even more credence to me for the nest team varying levels of protection

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:13.280
versus how close and proximity these men would get to the craft now jonathan's testimony is of

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:20.000
course truly startling one of the big questions remains now is what happened to the craft after

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.920
and jonathan and i talked about this i i decided not to include it here because it's it's speculation

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.360
with very little basis here but that that's a very interesting question to me this craft was lodged

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:38.560
into a granite cliff face almost how was it taken out how was it retrieved because if we're talking

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:44.400
about c47s and the night stockers sure they may have airlifted some kind of picked apart soviet

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:50.480
helicopters before but how do you get a craft of non-human origin a massive one and what are some

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:56.000
of the logistics here where the biologics taken out first was the rest of the liquid contains

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:02.320
and then taken out and what went on here and i do think one of the interesting parts of this story

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:08.480
is the liquid now as we dug into it jonathan and myself he kind of theorized that you know

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:12.960
maybe this liquid wasn't just a fuel a propulsion system but he thought because some liquid was

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:17.040
coming out of the recessed hole the hatch that was open where he saw the biologic hanging out

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.480
that water was coming from there that this craft may have been filled with water and that brings

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:28.240
up the question what if the species he encountered were almost an aquatic species that lived in the

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:33.920
water and the craft contained almost an aquarium or a closed system of water of sorts i think these

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.960
questions are highly interesting to ponder i think one of the most fruitful and frustrating avenues

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:46.160
of this research was reaching out to the fellow marines adkins alan and montaligre total i probably

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:53.440
reached out to 10 people connected with laser strike only one responded to me and that was one

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.120
of the marines that wagant claimed he was with now it is important to note here all three of those

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:07.680
marines montaligre alan and adkins all went career usmc they all retired enlisted but it retired

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.160
with very prestigious positions in marines i'm not saying there's a connection there but it is

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:18.080
interesting to see that jonathan kind of got made an example of and left the marines in 98 admitted

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.800
to using controlled substances so he could get out of the marines but these other guys enjoyed

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.520
very long careers now the one that responded to me again i'm not going to burn his name just because

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.320
i you know unlike brad s in the flux liner he hasn't sent me death threats so i'm not going to burn

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:41.280
his name or post any sort of screenshots of messages but i was a little displeased with how

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:46.560
he treated jonathan i said in the video and i'll say it again i i don't think that whistleblower

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:52.160
testimony should be kind of boiled down to saying that the witness just has mental issues i've seen

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:57.440
it before i'm sure we'll see it again this reminds me to the team leader of michael herera nathan who

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.320
just said that michael was crazy because he enjoyed lifting weights and spending time alone

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:10.000
whilst deployed and i find arguments like that to be to not have much in him now i would always

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.800
find it weird when contacting this marine most of his story would go just towards the impossibility

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:19.680
of usmc having hawk batteries improved at that time and i agree with that jonathan agrees with that

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.040
but he always said no the story's false the story can't be true because we didn't have

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.080
hawk batteries the lance corporal story is false so that's kind of a mute point to me but i also

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:34.000
think it's strange he said that jonathan never deployed to puculpa or to laser strike when mac g

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:40.000
28 marines very well indeed according to our laser strike documentation did deploy so that's a bit

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:47.600
of a curious point now of course i try and be as objective as i can in my videos but in the end of

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:53.280
my videos i tend to give my opinion guys i i do believe the encounter of jonathan wagan and i

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:57.120
believe it for a couple reasons not just talking to jonathan but talking to kind of people not

01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:02.400
connected with this i i do have conviction that this case is is real i think it's one of the most

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:08.640
extraordinary encounters of a downed ufo craft of all time that being said there's still mysteries

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:14.240
here with this case of course time slipping away so jonathan is remembering fewer and fewer details

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:18.560
i commend him for being able to say when he doesn't remember because this was 30 years ago

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:23.440
and as impactful as such an event would be there are going to be things he can't quite remember

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:30.720
like insignias on people's uniforms or tiny little details of the makeup of notches on a craft or the

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:35.600
digits on an arm hanging out these things i don't blame him for being able to recall and i commend

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:40.480
him for saying i'm speculating here or i don't recall when he doesn't know something but i i do

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:46.400
think this is a a case that did occur what happened to the craft we could only guess did it get taken

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:52.720
to the office of naval research because i suspect namru the naval because i suspect namru south had

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:58.960
some sort of implications here was their transfer of materials or liquid up to namru up in bright

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:05.440
paterson who knows now that being said my theory of of namru and my theory of iqitos and my theory

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:10.240
of the seventh this does still need work i think it's a strong thesis but of course we can't concrete

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:16.560
prove this the biggest take up here is of course namru being the location where wagon was held

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:22.160
versus him not receiving any medical treatment i do think this interesting that the doe personnel

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:29.120
probably nest you know i i think at this point it's almost a mute point to sit to try and argue

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.400
that it's not nest but he was stripped of his clothes clearly his clothes were taken off as soon

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:38.800
as he encountered the liquid when he was beaten by the other marines separated from adkins and

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:42.800
allen who knows what happened to them who knows what happened to the seven plus other marines

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.720
that were not in the vanguard that may have seen the craft that may have not made it down the ridge

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:52.880
wagon doesn't know and he was put into isolation threatened and so on so i think because he took

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.520
a swing at one of these men he was both made an example of and because he encountered the liquid

01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:03.600
there was a contamination threat but he didn't receive medical procedures is this a substance

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.400
that the doe nest team and retrieval teams are familiar with and maybe it's just like a slightly

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:13.120
acidic goopy water with the consistency of syrup so they weren't really worried but they wanted to

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:17.360
get those clothes off and maybe but that's all just speculation so is namer but i do think that

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.280
kind of fits the bill for a marine that came into contact with a non-human fluid get him isolated but

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:27.360
again he said this location was underground perhaps namer has underground facilities perhaps this

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:34.800
was nearby and i do think it's interesting he was driven back to his base now i need to get in

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:38.560
contact with somebody else stationed at raider detachment five which i really have tried to see

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.320
if there were a mac g 28 marines there because this would really solve quite a bit of this

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.400
but i do think it's interesting with the mar forlant training team and the special forces there

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:52.400
and all of the history of special forces whether that be the first one 228th aviation regiment or

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.880
the seven special forces up there in northern peru in history now of course this retrieval

01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:02.080
team could be a dedicated j-soc or former j-soc or so-called retrieval team that station in south

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.880
america maybe howard air force base and panama maybe somewhere else to react to these this would

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:10.240
fit in our time frame of retrieval too because i know i gave about nine hours it could be plus

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.640
or minus an hour even to that i have a lot of air here they could be stationed for south american

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.320
retrievals we just don't know i'm just trying to work with the best available evidence we have

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.760
and try and reconstruct the testimony so of course in my theory there's a lot of assumptions there

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:28.800
and i was the first to say that there's a lot of assumptions and if you have a competing theory

01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:32.400
of how this played out please let me know i'd love to hear it because at the end of the day i'm

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.320
just trying to take some of the pieces of evidence and fit them into a theory and i do think it's

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:40.560
strong but it is open to interpretation and probably open to error so if you have something

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:44.560
better there or something you think is stronger let me know i'd love to talk more about this case

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.600
speaking of let me know what you guys think in the comments because i know so many people have

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.000
wanted to hear more from weigand and i'm thrilled this has some exclusive conversations with him

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:59.920
for the first time really in since 2000 because on the martin willis show he he didn't really shed

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:04.880
new light on any details um i almost got the sense he didn't quite want to be there so

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.280
i was really glad weigand and i could form a friendship and then kind of sit down on camera

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:15.360
together and he was really nervous about being on camera he doesn't like it he's a very different

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:19.680
