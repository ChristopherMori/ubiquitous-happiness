0	5760	It was dripping this syrup like, like service custody is liquid.
5760	10560	It was everywhere, all down everywhere when we went down there because there was plants and everything.
10560	12160	It was, it was weird.
12160	19040	It was a purplish green color and you could tell it was like, it was just weird.
19040	29840	It was, it's hard to explain it kind of like, like, like it was like it seemed to just like be alive.
29840	35680	I mean, it was almost like, if you're looking like something organic, I don't know, I couldn't tell.
35680	39120	It didn't look like anything we would make, like machine parts or anything.
39120	41280	It looked like it was sculpted.
41280	42960	These were these large vents.
42960	46000	They looked like they went into the craft, but I couldn't tell.
46000	48080	But it, I mean, it was a shadow.
48080	50160	That was the only thing that really cast a shadow.
50160	58720	The rest of this, well, it was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow where you could see where there wasn't light.
58720	62400	But the sun was shining right on the object and it didn't cast a shadow.
62400	63520	Not on anything.
63520	65360	It was like kind of like absorbing the light.
65360	66960	It was weird, strange.
66960	71280	There was no reflection or anything like that, you know.
71280	73760	Is there anything positive at all that you've got now?
73760	76640	Yeah, I'm still alive.
76640	80800	Yeah, they threw me into the mud and all that liquid got my hair in my face.
80800	83280	Oh, they were like scientists, I suppose.
83280	89040	They had this typo, like we'd call it mop gear, right?
89040	90720	Mission-oriented protective posture.
90720	97200	And they had gas masks on and like rubber suits and they were coming around.
97200	99440	And you had all kinds of weird people there.
99440	106560	Some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on and personal protective gear.
106560	112240	And it was all different ones, different kinds.
112240	117280	Very few first-hand UFO witness encounters over the decades have matched the intrigue,
117280	122080	coherence, and respect as former US Marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan.
122080	127360	Lance Corporal Wagan first told of his harrowing UFO crash retrieval encounter during official
127360	133680	service in US Operation Laser Strike in the Peruvian jungle through Stephen Greer in the year 2000.
133680	138640	As a young perimeter security marine tasked to investigate a downed aircraft thought to be a
138640	143600	South American drug smuggling plane or friendly US vehicle, the Lance Corporal claimed to have
143600	149440	stumbled upon a crashed, egg-shaped UFO and subsequent Department of Energy retrieval team
149440	155520	that in my opinion gives us one of the greatest possible instances of insight into how US government
155520	158800	rapid reaction UFO recovery teams operate.
158800	164080	Since his original testimony, Wagan has publicly discussed his encounter with a non-human craft,
164080	167920	an antagonistic DOE retrieval team only once more.
167920	172400	In 2023, Jonathan Wagan appeared on a podcast with Martin Willis,
172400	177200	re-addressing aspects of the Lance Corporal's incredible encounter but exploring little new
177200	184720	ground. Today, I am beyond excited to announce a true successor to Jonathan Wagan's 2000 testimony,
184720	189280	an in-person discussion where Jonathan and myself discuss why he went public,
189280	195200	new details of the UFO crash retrieval encounter, adverse health effects and reprisals Jonathan has
195200	201120	faced and so much more. Before this discussion, I thought it pertinent to take a step back and
201120	207520	cover Wagan's testimony in painstaking details. After all, I have covered this case before in
207520	212480	one of my first ever projects but barely even scratched the surface of this encounter.
212480	217280	So before I sit down with Wagan in the coming weeks, let's take a step back and analyze
217280	223200	every single detail of this 1997 encounter, from piecing together the origins and deployment of
223200	228640	the DOE recovery team to contacting other Marines allegedly involved with the case,
228640	234240	to determining where Wagan may have been taken and interrogated to analyzing specific similar
234240	240320	egg-shaped UFO crash retrievals. Let us leave no stone unturned analyzing one of the most
240320	244640	fascinating first-hand UFO crash retrieval cases in history.
244640	249680	Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we embark on a
249680	255200	comprehensive analysis of the claims of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan. As a precursor to my
255200	260160	in-person interview with Jonathan, I thought it pertinent to step back and critically analyze
260160	266000	the entirety of his testimony. This investigation will not seek to simply retell this incredible
266000	273200	UFO crash case but to unravel this case and gain insights into US UFO crash retrieval teams.
273200	279120	And before we get started a few things to point out, I would like to thank RGHUFOs and take OM
279120	284880	for their incredible 2023 work into Wagan's case. These excellent researchers arrived at many
284880	289680	of the same conclusions I did long before this project so please check out their work in the
289680	295440	video description. I'll also be pulling clips from Wagan's 2023 podcast with Martin Willis
295440	301360	and 2000 tape testimony with Steven Greer. And it is worthy to note, Greer chopped up Wagan's
301360	306800	original testimony, emitting certain details. These include Wagan describing what looked to be
306800	312640	a four-fingered arm hanging out of a recessed hall in the crashed UFO. Greer seemingly omitted
312640	317920	this from the 2000 testimony. Due to this, I will be pulling Wagan's recorded tapes off
317920	324000	of Steven Greer's DPI archive to try and capture Wagan's words uncut and in their purest form.
324000	329120	But these files are still chopped up and edited. I have found it impossible to get my hands on
329120	335200	the full unedited tape but this is the closest we can get. Due to these rough files, audio quality
335200	339200	is significantly worse than the published interview but I still find it important to
339200	344720	publish Wagan's words without edits. These source files contain many additional details,
344720	349760	time spent with Wagan's military records and drawings, as well as questions asked by filmmaker
349760	354080	James Foxx that were curiously cut out of the 2000 published interview.
354480	359040	This one was the one that was half open and you could see into it but I mean it was just
359040	366560	black as like looking into a closet. Alongside the 2000 tape, I have found and will be often
366560	372160	referencing Jonathan's outreach to Greer's team from August 2000, just two months before his tape
372160	377680	testimony. And of course it goes without saying, I will often be pulling my own clips from my time
377680	383200	spent with Jonathan Wagan. With all that being said, let's start our investigation and first
383200	388960	travel back all the way to 1997 to relive the experience of Lance Corporal Wagan.
394880	401680	And basically I was there and then I was transferred over to the section for laser
401680	408320	strike in February of 1997. As a young man, Jonathan Wagan joined the Marine Corps in 1995
408880	414080	until 1998. After a back injury suffered in training, Jonathan's service led him to the
414080	419600	second low-altitude air defense battalion within the Marine Corps Air Control Group 28 stationed
419600	425120	at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. During this time, Wagan served as a low-altitude air
425120	430160	defense gunner with training on Stinger man portable air defense systems, man pads, and
430160	438000	Avenger surface-to-air missiles, SAM platforms. In 1997, Wagan and the USMC MACG-28 were deployed
438000	443360	to Bukalpa, Peru to support Operation Laser Strike specifically to operate as perimeter
443360	449200	security for mission radar installations and to replace aging hawk missile batteries with Stinger
449200	454640	and Avenger missile platforms. Laser Strike was one of numerous US worldwide classified
454640	460480	operations under US Southcom or US Southern Command to counter narcotics traffic in Peru.
460480	466400	The operation included up to 20 US agencies including the USMC, Drug Enforcement Agency,
466400	472800	Air Force, CIA, National Guard, and US Army Special Forces, as well as local Peruvian forces such as
472800	479040	Peruvian Air Force or FAP. Laser Strike served to conduct three phases of counter drug operations
479040	484480	including illegal use of airspace, alternate transportation modes, and production capabilities.
484480	489440	Laser Strike employed several acknowledged data acquisition and radar systems to accomplish its
489920	497520	including TPS-43 and relocatable over-the-horizon radar systems, or RothR, and possibly covertly
497520	503840	utilize satellites from the Defense Support Program. In 1996, Laser Strike proceeded Operation
503840	509920	Green Clover, a similar US Southcom operation to combat narcotics transfer in Peru and Colombia
509920	516800	but much smaller in scale. In the 12 month period from April 1996 to April 97, within the timeline
516800	523040	of Jonathan's encounter, air and ground-based radar used by Laser Strike tracked 45,000 total
523040	530240	aircraft. 5,390 of these were quote-unquote tracks of interest. Only 150 of these were
530240	536240	suspected of drug trafficking but only 21 such planes were forced or shot down. However,
536240	542240	the exact number of shoot-downs was classified. Three primary locations satisfied this mission
542320	548720	conducted in Peru, Puculpa, Andoas, and Iquitos, whose mission was to track, identify, and ground
548720	554960	by warning or force drug trafficking aircraft entering or leaving Peruvian airspace. In support
554960	560080	of Laser Strike and counter drug operations, US Special Forces were additionally sent to Iquitos
560080	565680	Peru to the Mar Forlant Riverine Training Team to train with Peruvian military forces.
565680	571760	US Southcom authorized up to 14 Special Forces deployments to the region during 1997,
571760	576960	and one major Special Forces group that aided in South American counter drug operations attached
576960	583200	to US Southcom was the US Army 7th Special Forces Group, aka the US Army Green Berets,
583200	588880	out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Historically, the 7th Special Forces out of SOCOM or Special
588880	594320	Operations Command within the 1st Special Forces Command had previously been deployed in Operation
594320	601200	SNOCAP, a drug enforcement agency counter narcotics operation in 9 Latin American countries alongside
601200	606800	the US Navy SEALs. The Army 7th Special Forces Group has conducted foreign internal defense,
606800	611680	counter drug, and training missions in Central and South America. The 7th specializes in
611680	617760	unconventional warfare and direct action, special reconnaissance, counter proliferation of WMD,
617760	621600	or warheads of mass destruction, and security force assistance.
621600	626000	Why all this discussion of Green Berets and Special Operations Command units attached to
626000	631040	Laser Strike? Recall how quite often I discuss the involvement of Special Operations Command,
631040	636400	or their elite component command, JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command in UFO crash retrieval
636400	641360	operations. Well, this will all become apparent quite soon when discussing Wagan's retrieval
641360	646640	encounter. Up to his involvement in Laser Strike, Jonathan had no interest in the subject of UFOs,
646640	651440	but his worldview was somewhat shaken during his guard station performing perimeter security at
651440	656080	his Laser Strike radar installation. Wagan would state in the command center of the radar
656080	661440	installation he would overhear USAF personnel discussing aircraft tracked flying in and out
661440	667760	of the atmosphere at Mach 10 plus. I knew that these these aircraft were flying because I had been
667760	674080	in the command center there at the radar installation and I heard a couple women there in the Air Force
674080	680560	talking about aircraft flying in and out of the atmosphere at Mach 10 plus. So these aircraft
680560	684560	are flying around there, you know, they're re-entering the atmosphere or whatever they're
684560	688800	talking about. We got these aircraft flying again and the other girl says, yeah, you know,
688800	694080	they're coming in and out of the atmosphere. There's our stuff and so there's our aircraft,
694080	699360	and they're like, you know, I can't remember what she said. Wagan would even state an Air Force
699360	704240	Colonel would enter the command center about 30 minutes after this conversation and confiscate
704240	711840	logbooks tracking flight data. I'm not sure, but I think these logs did contain those tracks,
711840	716960	otherwise they wouldn't have taken them. And we're talking about, you know, there's hundreds,
716960	721600	thousands of aircraft flying through there, you know, weekly and all these logs, you know,
721600	725840	they're writing them in and, you know, and they're keeping their writing, you know, how many times
725840	730880	certain aircraft or they get certain vectors for aircraft that are supposed to be around it.
731520	736400	I mean, when you got, when you got objects that are re-entering the atmosphere and then stopping
736400	741920	on a dog and then turning around and going exactly the opposite direction, that's kind of strange.
741920	746240	Meteors don't do that. Oh, is this something that was rare or something that was happening?
746240	750640	Oh, this was happening all the time. There was like three or four incidents where I was duty there
750640	754160	that the same, the same Air Force officer came in there to give books.
755200	760000	And do you think these were tracked on to the freight arts? Yeah, these were tracked from this
760000	765760	particular radar that were logged in. The reason, I guess the reason they were taking them is they
765760	770720	didn't want people to know that they're tracking these aircraft. I guess, I mean, give us, I'm just
770720	776720	assuming that. One night while on guard duty at around 11 p.m. to midnight between April and March
776720	783040	1997, Wigant was approached by Staff Sergeant Monteligre, Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Adkins,
783040	787840	and told that there was a downed aircraft, possibly friendly, and that he and other Marines were
787840	793600	needed to secure the crash site. By three to four a.m., Jonathan, Adkins, and Allen were in the
793600	798880	vanguard of a group of Humvees among eight to 10 Marines sent to secure the crash area.
798880	803760	After a combination of driving and trekking through the jungle, the Marines reached the site around
803760	814400	six to seven a.m. And they, they came to us and said, look, you know, we got, we got a situation
814480	822720	where we, we have an aircraft crash that's possibly friendly and they need us to go and secure the
822720	828640	crash site and we're like fine. So this is early, this is late at night. I'm about 11 or 12 at night.
829280	834160	I was on guard duty that night. So I was already up and it was my shift. We have 12 hour shifts,
834160	842480	12 on, 12 off, and where we, where we rotate our section. So we all went out that night. We got up
843040	847360	I don't know, three or four in the morning and headed out in Humvees. We had about five or
847360	852320	six Hummers and we drove to where we needed to go. And then we, from there, you know, we had to
852320	858240	hump through the bush. So we got there, I don't know, six, seven, just, just one daylight had just
858240	864400	just started to get light. And well, we found the area really easy because there was a, there was a
864400	870960	huge gash in the land where, where something had crashed. And it, it didn't break anything. You
870960	875360	know, you know, I don't know if you've ever been to a crash site where, you know, you had, you know,
875360	880800	had trees, you know, just broken like, like in half. Everything was burned. And it was like,
880800	885440	like if you had almost cut like a warm butter with a knife, I mean, it was just,
886240	891280	it's like, it's, it's like something on fire or had energy or some kind of energy and like a laser
891280	896640	almost had, had like gutted. I mean, it was really strange. And anyway, I was, I was in the front
896640	902880	with Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Ankins. We were up front. And we were, we were point basically.
902880	907040	And we were like, I don't know, 10, 20 meters and head of everyone else. We had, we all had
907040	912240	maps and radios and compasses. So we knew so we wouldn't get lost. And basically, we were the
912240	919520	first ones to see the object. And basically what happened is we didn't go straight up the hill.
919520	924320	Because basically this thing went up the hill and then off into the side of the ravine of the
924320	930160	ridge. This is about a 200 foot ridge, at least solid granite. I mean, it's rock. I don't know
930160	936400	if it's granite. It was buried in the side of the cliff. But anyway, we didn't go straight up. We went
936400	942000	to the, to the, to all to the left and walked up to the top of the ridge. And that's when we saw the
942000	948640	craft. But I mean, it had landed and cut its way through the jungle and embedded itself in the,
948640	953040	in like a, I don't know what you would call it almost like a saddle or one of these kind of
953120	960240	foothills. It's kind of a ridge and it went into the side of it. And I can't remember how far from
960240	966960	the initial impact that when it landed, it actually physically hit the deck and then went in. I don't
966960	972800	know how far down it was. Yeah, yeah, man. It burned itself like into the deck, you know, like a foot
972800	978080	or two. I don't know. It was deep. The terrified and confused Marines climbed down the ridge to get
978080	983520	closer to this object with Waygant getting the closest of all the Marines. Waygant Allen and
983520	990320	Adkins observed a huge ship embedded at a 45 degree angle into the rocky cliff face. This is the
990320	997040	craft. This is pretty crude two dimensional drawing. But this is jungle here. And this was the craft
997040	1005520	and it was embedded in the rock like this. And I'm not sure if this tapered off or how it went.
1005520	1011120	But these right here are the hatches, these two objects here. This one was the one that was half
1011120	1015840	open. And you could see into it. But I mean, it was just black is like looking into a closet.
1018720	1023520	Damage I think from the missile. And these were these large vents, they look like they went into
1023520	1028800	the craft, but I couldn't tell. But I mean, it was a shadow. That was the only thing that really
1028800	1036160	cast a shadow. The rest of this was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow where you
1036160	1040720	could see where there wasn't light. But the sun was shining around on the object and it didn't
1040720	1046480	cast a shadow not on anything. It was like kind of like absorbing the light. It's weird. Strange.
1046480	1052800	There was no reflection or anything like that. The object was a massive metallic egg or teardrop
1052800	1059520	shape measuring 10 meters in height and 20 meters in length. Probably like three or four
1060880	1069600	standard 53 foot trailers wide and about three, like like one, two, three, four,
1070400	1076880	one, two, three, four. So about 16 of those together. So it was pretty big, man. It was
1076880	1082000	catastrophic damage likely leading to the crash of the vehicle was visible. No debris littered
1082000	1087600	the area, but Wageant observed an enormous gash in the rear of the craft. Jonathan guessed this
1087600	1093280	damage to be from Hawk MIM-23 missile batteries. Although Hawk systems were phased out of military
1093280	1100960	use in 1994, the USMC maintained usage until 2002. However, Wageant guessed the Hawk system used to
1100960	1107040	down the craft was used by the Peruvian Air Force. This being because the USMC phased out Hawk
1107040	1112960	missiles from laser strike in early 1997. Though he has no direct knowledge to this day,
1112960	1118880	Wageant after extensive studying of MIM-23 ballistics believes Hawk fragmentation missiles
1118880	1123920	caused the damage and downing of the craft. Yeah, well, what I think happened, I think a lot of
1123920	1129920	that fragmentation like went into the craft and like bounced around right after it got
1129920	1135600	headed as it was going down. So it probably didn't come out. But like I said, if the missile had hit
1136560	1142720	depending on what the craft was made of and depending on the speed of the missile and its
1142720	1148720	angle and all that, I think it probably would have penetrated and exploded and it would have
1148720	1154560	just disintegrated the ship totally. This then presents a unique question. How could a conventional
1154560	1160480	missile down a highly advanced non-human craft? Similar intriguing incidents like a quote-unquote
1160480	1166800	one in a million targeting of a teardrop shaped UFO by a naval destroyer in 1973 was discussed in
1166800	1173120	my last project on naval legacy programs. MIM-23 Hawk missiles are unique. Hawks are not only able
1173120	1179040	to utilize conventional missiles but also airburst rounds which exploded near not on a target to
1179040	1184720	damage enemy personnel or vehicles with devastating fragmentation. Perhaps a conventional missile
1184720	1191680	could never hit a moving UFO but perhaps in this case a hawk MIM-23 got just close enough to frag
1191680	1197360	and down a target. But let's get back to the wreckage. The best way Wigant could describe the
1197360	1203600	craft was metallic but organic almost as if it was alive. The object did not appear as if it was
1203600	1210000	made of machine parts but more sculpted. The craft was purplish green and fluctuating in color almost
1210080	1215200	like gasoline on water. This effect is known as the mother of pearl effect and the changing colors
1215200	1221600	would sometimes even make the craft near translucent. Well I thought at one point it
1221600	1227200	looked half like green and half purple and then it was kind of it was it was changing
1228320	1234000	the image of the not not the physical properties of it how it was was constructed or whatever
1234720	1240480	but that there was some kind of field on it and it was going like I said with Greer it was like
1240480	1246560	you know when you wash your car would you know fluid right with like palm olive or whatever
1246560	1252880	disc detergent and when it bubbles up it gives like the the color chemical rainbow it was like
1252880	1259120	that but all over the craft and it was kind of like moving around weird I can't so it wasn't
1259200	1265520	just no no it was it was kind of like moving around and going sometimes it would go like
1265520	1272080	completely like almost like silver right the disabled craft was dripping a liquid with the
1272080	1277680	viscosity of syrup this liquid had poured all over the surrounding foliage that hatch
1278480	1284320	that was a jar or busted open broke open that's where the liquid seemed to come from right
1284400	1287360	and it seemed to come out of there and it was everywhere man
1288880	1296720	it was clear well no the the the whatever that stuff was I don't know what to call it the fluid
1296720	1303600	it was clear like just you know water water clear the fluid was clear yeah but it was viscous like
1303600	1308480	yeah but it was thick like maple syrup a large sweeping light traveled around the circumference
1308480	1313360	of the vehicle that slowed until the vehicle seemingly powered off along with this sweeping
1313360	1318640	light wagan could hear the craft dimming until it went silent wagan described the sound as a
1318640	1325680	guitar amplifier there was there was one light on it that slowly went around and in the machine I
1325680	1332320	could hear it I can hear I guess because it was still functioning and had like a like a hum to it
1332320	1338560	like like a really bass like say if you unplugged an amp from a guitar that kind of you know it was
1338880	1344160	really really you know it's really deep but it was loud it was loud man it was like a deep
1344880	1350800	like that like you know rap it would be it would have been like several orders of magnitude louder
1350800	1359200	than you know the real deep bass rap boom boom boom right it was like boom it was like this but it
1359200	1364000	was more like a I don't know man I just can't describe it's not even like that man it's just
1364000	1370400	indescribable it was that light cycling it's almost sounded like a chemical sound man like a chemical
1370400	1375920	like watery kind of like sound man like you're it's weird and that light was slowing down right yeah
1375920	1381280	it finally stopped right everything like shut off this sound of a guitar amp is almost identical
1381280	1386480	to the testimony of former marine michael herera who described the same sound emanating from an
1386480	1392560	eight-gone alien reproduction vehicle as jonathan got closer to the craft he was able to make out more
1392560	1398720	surface detail such as the craft not being smooth but featuring what looked to be notches and bumps
1398720	1404400	50 to 100 yards away from the craft jonathan got the mysterious liquid all over what marines call
1404400	1411280	camis or battle dress uniform the liquid discolored his camis like acid and ate jonathan's skin
1412000	1416800	so you got within like 150 or 300 view of this right this thing was so high up on the cliff
1416800	1420800	phase you got some of this liquid on yeah yeah it was everywhere man and what did it do to you
1420800	1426480	what did it do to your clothes well i mean they took my clothes but my basic my hair on my legs
1426480	1432400	went away and it's never really come back i lost all my hair on my on my on my legs determined yet
1432400	1437920	frightened the young lance corporal maintained his gaze on this incredible ship the crashed vehicle
1437920	1443760	additionally featured large vents on the freestanding side wagant described similar to fish gills
1443760	1448720	though he could only see one side of the craft jonathan wagered these same gills he guessed
1448720	1453920	were used for propulsion were featured on the other side of the craft yeah on the part of it
1453920	1461440	looked like i don't know what it was but yeah it had sort of like these um under a really tight
1461440	1469440	kind of like ellipse that ran down the side like got small got got progressively smaller
1470640	1476160	and i only saw it like a couple freaking times because it was the weird i don't know what it was
1476320	1483360	the all i could say it was like some type of four shield i don't know what it was three seemingly
1483360	1489840	non-flush hatches sat near the top of the craft one of these hatches being half open although no
1489840	1494880	lights were visible from behind the hatch wagant did observe what appeared to be a four-fingered
1494880	1501040	arm hanging limply from the open hatch this element of wagant's testimony was seemingly cut from his
1501120	1507120	2000 interview with wagant confirming to me that it must have indeed been cut as he did inform
1507120	1514800	greer of this arm yeah one of the creatures was his arm and hand was hanging out he was hanging out
1515360	1519680	did it come out was it hanging out when you walked up to it or was it yeah he was hanging out probably
1519680	1524240	dying i don't know about the other pilot i don't know what they were to be honest with you but
1524240	1530000	i guess you could call them aliens or whatever i guess that would be yeah yeah right and uh one of
1530480	1538240	i think he was dying almost or close to death right from the crash but like i said this is
1539280	1544560	this is what i thought at the time i mean i don't know this detail is very interesting as i am
1544560	1550960	reminded of the 1965 keksburg pennsylvania crash retrieval encounter where multiple eyewitnesses
1550960	1556960	described biologics inside the bell shaped craft whose appendages were visible once a craft hatch
1556960	1563040	had opened and the vehicle was depressurized so you and two sergeants kind of who led the vanguard
1563040	1567360	got the closest to craft but you got the closest right i was the closest to it and the other two
1567360	1573360	sergeants were kind of standing a little bit off while you got right yeah and i ran up to it was
1573360	1577920	there anything weird about your guys's compasses comms yeah all that was all you know it wasn't
1577920	1584160	working so your compass was it just going haywire yeah it was spinning around around the same time
1584160	1590320	jonathan felt like a presence was reaching out to contact him you got a clear sense that there were
1591920	1598160	some kind of life forms yes it was life forms and the ship i and i could they were it's almost
1598160	1603920	like if someone was like reading your mind and that's the way it felt and i felt like i felt a
1603920	1612640	presence it's like supernatural you know but i felt this presence that it's real strange i guess it
1612640	1618880	was almost like i think the kree i told leslie is i thought the creatures were they called me and it
1618880	1623680	was like weird they were i think they were trying to communicate with me like i guess telepathically
1623680	1628960	it's really weird i don't believe in it and any of that stuff but anyway it was i could i could hear
1628960	1635120	like it was terrible because it kept going and then it still comes and goes it's like basically
1635120	1640160	sitting in your car and turning on like an am station that's not the you know it's just white
1640240	1645440	noise just turning on really high and that's what i heard when i when i first got in there and i
1645440	1651120	didn't ask any of the other guys that i was with if they heard that or anything jonathan was mesmerized
1651120	1655840	by this presence he felt the creatures were informing him that everything would be all right but
1655840	1662000	we're also requesting his help he was so spellbound he ignored the cries and cussings of sergeants
1662000	1667520	alan and adkins who stood away from the craft shouting at wey gantt not to get any closer
1667520	1674480	they were they were scared it was the apprehension the fear and then they they were not here at
1674480	1679680	home is that's really what what it felt like and i mean that's not that's not my own emotions
1679680	1683600	that was something that they were projecting towards me like if somebody would shadow like a
1683600	1689200	spotlight i mean that's what i felt they were directing their thoughts at me i mean this is not
1690000	1695520	i mean i didn't think about all this at the time but it's been the currencies were i've seen the
1695520	1703120	creatures of my in my thoughts and i've seen i saw them what they look like and they projected
1703120	1708560	and i didn't i didn't tell leon i didn't tell leslie this you know i was it was like you know it was
1708560	1714560	the grays basically and and i'm not just saying that but and i never really was into the ufo stuff
1714560	1720400	and i didn't read books on when i was a kid but basically the the oval that the the oval egg had
1720400	1728960	with big dark eyes big eyes our nose and small mouth new ears i think i've had you know dreams of them
1730080	1735760	i don't you know so but i didn't see them but they were not the small you know small kind of like
1735760	1739840	three or four foot right they were huge you said these were tall like eight to ten feet yeah they
1739840	1745600	were huge yeah what it what were their heads like like classic yeah classic but really like elongated
1746320	1750880	kind of coming up like this and they'd have been probably this big like a balloon yeah no
1751760	1757760	like the kind of like the more oblong shape not like the classic if you look at communion right
1757760	1764080	the wittly streber right but the artwork they have on there they would not have been fat like that
1764080	1771040	they were more skinnier but they were also like on a kind of a skinny heart they were
1771040	1776640	projecting that they weren't here they were here they were here they weren't here you know that they
1776640	1780960	weren't not going to harm me that was basically that everything is going to be all right just
1780960	1787520	help me get this helps get out of here i think do i don't i don't know how many were on the craft
1787520	1792720	yeah that's more than one yeah definitely more than one probably about four or five i don't
1792720	1797440	know just this not i mean not a water's number the communication from the occupants of the craft
1797440	1802320	as well as the appearance of the craft led jonathan to believe this vehicle was controlled
1802320	1807760	via thoughts with the massive discussion of psionics here in 2025 through the testimony of
1807760	1814720	jake barber and sky watchers this early mention of basically psionics in 2000 by wagant is extremely
1814720	1820480	interesting additionally i have discussed before dating all the way back to the 1950s stories and
1820480	1825440	testimonies of ufo's being controlled with consciousness headband transceivers are unique
1825440	1830640	control mechanisms to learn more about this subject i do recommend checking out my video on
1830640	1836400	the claims of colonel philip j corso after about 15 to 20 minutes at the site wagant and the other
1836400	1841760	marines embarked to climb back up the ridge to rendezvous with the rest of the mac g28 marines
1841760	1847920	when they were greeted by two to four army ch-47 helicopters flying overhead preparing to land
1847920	1852960	in a nearby clearing when jonathan and the others climbed to the top of the gorge the marines were
1852960	1859040	quickly intercepted by armed men dressed in black fatigue styled similarly to a swat team
1859040	1865440	it was almost like they were there already they were on the ground already and and whoever was
1865440	1871360	flying over was coming in after they these guys had landed so i'm and i'm not sure where they
1871360	1876240	they landed where they were but they were just there on top of the site within a few minutes and so
1877200	1880880	i can't remember exactly how it's speculation on your part you don't know for sure but you
1880880	1883840	think it's possible that team may have been there first yeah they were all they were definitely
1883840	1889200	there first and they were monitoring us too i'm sure they knew we were in the area we got up there
1889200	1894640	and you're but they looked army but they didn't have you know insignia on them right they were same
1894640	1901040	color and all this these men spoke with american dialects but bore no insignia patches or identification
1901040	1907200	the men were older in their late 30s and 40s and immediately showed signs of extreme hostility
1907200	1914000	and aggression black bdus right what was the army would call bdus like our camis right they're
1914000	1920240	like our our uh fatigues but they would have been totally black totally black sure and they had helmets
1920240	1927600	on um no the guys that were on the deck no they had uh those uh they had boony caps and they had
1927600	1933920	just the soft uh army covers round army covers do you remember what kind of weapons they had was it
1934000	1942480	back here in the marisa i think they had mp3s and and glocks and shotguns okay so i think maybe
1942480	1947680	there was a few m16s i mean this has been a long time they had many guns on the on the on the uh
1947680	1952880	47s so the ch is actually had they had many guns on the side did they have a man at the gun yeah
1952880	1958640	they had a man and he was wearing like this skull type of freaking helmet man it's like a really wicked
1958640	1964080	yeah it looks so when when this team encountered you guys did they have their weapons trained at
1964080	1970160	you were you not at gunpoint oh yeah and so they immediately start do they strip you guys of gear
1970160	1975360	what do they rough you up yeah no they were we were setting our gear up and taking them out and
1975360	1980160	throwing it out and emptying our pockets and everything later in our investigation we will
1980160	1985520	devote a significant amount of time to attempt to track down the origin of this team so sit tight
1985520	1990960	for a little bit having the jump on the marines the unknown operators stripped wagan allen and
1990960	1996160	adkins of their gear and weapons the young lance corporal took a swing at one of the men cracking
1996160	2002560	him on his head for his transgressions jonathan was beaten restrained and forced to lie down face
2002560	2008240	down on the jungle floor getting even more of the strange liquid on him during this scuffle a team
2008240	2014400	of near 30 began departing the landed ch 47 helicopters this team featured individuals in
2014400	2021360	rain jackets bearing three letters delta oscar echo oh yeah they were like scientists i suppose
2021360	2028880	they had uh this type of uh like um we call it mop gear right mission oriented protective posture
2028880	2035600	and uh they had gas masks on and like rubber suits and uh they were they were coming around and yet
2035600	2042160	all kinds of weird people there some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on
2043040	2050320	and personal protective gear and uh and it was all different ones different kinds do we is of
2050320	2055360	course the acronym for the infamous department of energy the successor to the atomic energy
2055360	2062480	commission whose 1954 atomic energy act historically served as a monolith to misclassify ufo materials
2062480	2068720	and data as quote unquote trans classified foreign nuclear information is there any indication that
2068800	2074320	department of energy is involved in uap data collection and housing i don't have an answer
2075200	2082000	i can't confirm or deny that in a public setting and could you do it in a secure setting yes the
2082000	2086960	do we really needs no introduction whether it's my work the reporting of chris sharp or the words
2086960	2094000	of david grush the do we is almost always mentioned as a primary pillar of ufo legacy program operations
2094000	2100080	key in my work are the numerous implications of the does ffr dcs or federally funded research and
2100080	2105280	development centers such as laurence livermore national labs low salamos national labs sandia
2105280	2111520	national labs and do we contractors such as triad national security one third of which is run by
2111520	2117200	betel memorial institutes direct involvement in technologies of unknown origin exploitation
2117200	2122240	programs and similar to the seasoned operators soon in this video we will attempt to track down
2122240	2128160	exactly what this do we team was where they were stationed and more in addition to the people in
2128160	2133280	department of energy rain jackets the team featured members dressed in biological containment
2133280	2140480	suits dawned with do we lettering we can't describe these as similar to spacesuits it wasn't like
2140480	2145600	that it was more high-tech like this big jumpsuits that you zip up the back and you can like we're
2145600	2151520	breathing apparatus in there those guys there was about 30 of them at least and they marched right by
2151520	2156720	me as i was i was being taken away they were marching to get down into the cliff i guess they
2156720	2162160	were in there to check this thing out these suits mentioned remindingly closely of myriad crash
2162160	2167200	retrieval team testimonies i've covered in the past and i'm immediately reminded of eyewitness
2167200	2173200	accounts to the 1965 kexburg pennsylvania ufo crash where witnesses claimed that men in quote
2173200	2179040	unquote moon suits carried boxes and equipment into the crash site a little while later there
2179040	2185920	was a large truck pulled in a light colored truck box van pipe out of it there was four guys come
2185920	2193440	out they had what we call moon suits at the time they were white coverall type suit they took a
2193440	2202320	box out of their box maybe four or five foot square they carried down four handles and they
2202320	2208240	carried that down to the object but just right after that there was a military man
2209200	2214000	after being restrained and beaten by the operators jonathan was stripped his underwear by the men
2214000	2219040	in containment suits before having his feet bound and was handcuffed to a stretcher did the other
2219040	2223920	two sergeants have any liquid on them uh no not that i remember i'm the only one i think got hit with
2223920	2231440	all that because they were they they did not go up under the the craft and in the very close immediate
2231600	2237440	vicinity of it at this time wagant was separated from alan and adkins and taken aboard one of the
2237440	2243120	teen's helicopters no no they said that you know that that that that i was they were cussing at me
2243120	2250000	saying that i was a why don't you why don't you f*** people ever you know pay attention to orders
2250000	2254000	you aren't supposed to be there and you're not supposed to see this and you know you're
2254000	2257760	you're going to be dangerous if we let you go and all this stuff yeah i mean i thought i was i
2257760	2261120	thought they were going to kill me really i thought we have i'm f***ing finished you
2261760	2266480	wagant was flown to a base different than his deployment site this location featured
2266480	2271040	significantly more permanent structures than his radar site and jonathan guessed this was
2271040	2277760	partially a peruvian military installation curiously here wagant observed not just americans on site
2277760	2282400	but many nationalities there's a lot of other nationalities there are chinese
2282960	2286320	germans i think were there i mean a lot of other people were at this other base
2287040	2292000	but i mean this thing it was really i mean i didn't go in and all they did was take me to like a
2292000	2298720	like a you couldn't call it a cell it was more of like a it was more like an interrogation but
2298720	2304080	i sat in there for i don't know 15 hours yeah they were merged man that was the other thing because
2305360	2311120	yeah a lot of those dudes didn't the china there was two chinese dudes there that i remember
2311120	2316160	they spent very little english but they were in the german the german spent perfect english right
2316160	2321920	they were in military fatigues yeah same black do they have weapons yeah pistols i would assume
2321920	2326720	that they were glocks but i didn't i couldn't see them because they're the they're the standard
2327360	2333360	us pistol like and it covers it up they were holstered on the hip yeah right so this these guys
2333920	2337600	by their black hammies may have been from the same team yeah i was looking at them and they
2337600	2342960	yelled at me they're not for me not to look at them look at them wow i didn't think they wanted
2342960	2346720	me to remember and that's what they why they did that from what you could see what were they doing
2346720	2351200	were they just kind of at general station yeah just whatever they were doing i don't know what they
2351200	2357120	were doing with whatever i have a strong thesis of where this location might be and we will discuss
2357120	2363200	this soon wagant was not taken into a cell or forced into isolated barracks but was instead taken
2363200	2369040	underground and sequestered in an interrogation room where he was contained for up to two days
2369040	2373600	during this hellacious stay jonathan was interrogated and tormented by one of the
2373600	2379600	operators who detained him and i couldn't really relatively identify any of these guys but i knew
2379600	2385040	i knew that i knew one of them was at the crash site because they were one of the guys that i
2385040	2390160	recognized because he was in black fatigue and he's like what you see and he's like weird and he's
2390240	2396080	like growling you know he goes are you a patriot you like the constitution i'm like yeah he's like
2396080	2400480	well we don't we do it you know we're on our own program you know we don't obey we just do what we
2400480	2404560	want he's like yeah and they're like and they're growling and they're relishing you know and they're
2404560	2409200	yelling at me and they're hollering the cursing we didn't see anything you know and we'll do you
2409200	2415040	and your whole family and they're you know it was it was basically that for about eight or nine hours
2415040	2420080	i mean they took breaks basically they're like look man we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna just
2420080	2424960	we're gonna take you off in the helicopter when we was kicked out out of the jungle and you're just
2424960	2430000	gonna get you know we're gonna end you and all this and they didn't physically they didn't physically
2430000	2434400	put their hands on me i was sitting in a chair and i was handcuffed in the chair and i couldn't
2435280	2440320	so basically you know it was just this this like harassment towards the end of his confinement
2440320	2445760	a lieutenant colonel from the air force visited weigand this colonel bore no name tag nor did he
2445760	2451280	disclose his identity the colonel threatened weigand's life repeatedly telling him this clandestine
2451280	2456560	operation would have no trouble leaving weigand dead in the jungle the colonel then made weigand
2456560	2462800	sign multiple documents securing his silence on his incredible yet horrific encounter and he told me
2462800	2467440	you know you know you know if we just took you out in the jungle you know they'd never find you
2467440	2472320	out there and i'm like and you know i didn't want to see you know you know i didn't want to test
2472320	2476720	and see if you'd really do that so i said yeah and he's like you got to sign these papers and
2476720	2482800	you never saw this and i don't exist in this situation never happened and if you tell anybody
2482800	2489760	you know you know you'll just come on messing and and he was a real abrasive just just just a cynical
2490960	2496800	i guess the best way to put it you know what what papers well there were it was a the standard
2496800	2502960	form that you signed for it's like it's almost like a waiver i don't know i'd probably be able to
2502960	2508080	identify another paper like that i guess it's it's for if you if you've seen something you're not
2508080	2514640	supposed to sign that you didn't see it or whatever it's basically a security form i believe and there
2514640	2520720	was two of those that i signed and after that i was driven back to my base jonathan was finally
2520720	2526560	driven back to his original radar installation this is a key point here for our upcoming investigation
2526560	2532800	wagon was in close enough proximity to be driven back to the original base and not flown i don't
2532800	2539680	remember leaving though but i know i went out because they they they put a uh they put a mask over
2539680	2546800	me i had a mask over me when i when i got to the base they put it on before i got out of the helicopter
2547680	2555200	and uh when i left from where i was where they held me they put one on um i mean it had something
2555280	2559920	open where i could breathe but i couldn't see and i couldn't hear and they brought me out and
2559920	2564880	they took me to this flatline jonathan was segregated with use af personnel at his
2564880	2570800	original base for three weeks before being sent back to cherry point while there jonathan had no
2570800	2578240	opportunity to contact allen adkins or the other marines by may of 97 while still in service jonathan
2578240	2584560	became tormented by the event experiencing horrific nightmares missing time and weird dreams
2584560	2589280	none of these symptoms had occurred before witnessing the crash to this day jonathan
2589280	2595680	maintains there were internal usmc attempts to make him appear unstable and an unreliable witness
2595680	2601120	by late 97 jonathan confessed to using banned substances so he could be discharged by the
2601120	2607680	marines around this time mac g 28 and the criminal investigation division made his life horrific and
2607680	2614240	by march of 1998 wagon was discharged now let's move over to investigating the retrieval encounter
2614240	2619760	in extreme detail an attempt to break down every single detail of this retrieval
2625360	2631200	after we climbed back up the uh the i think the doe department of energy people were there
2631200	2637040	they knew about it and i don't know why we went there still in this day but anyway i was arrested
2637920	2643840	uh i had all my gear taken from me by men and black hammies had no no name tags they were older
2644400	2649600	probably in their third late 30s or 40s i got a little scuffle with them and i hit one of them i
2649600	2656880	took a swing one of them and i hit him in the forehead yeah they had they had the big d you
2656880	2662880	know delta oscar echo on the back of their back of a couple the guys were wearing like these uh
2662880	2668880	these rain jackets because it had been raining the fall of the previous day and they were in
2668880	2672560	there and there were other guys that were wearing containment like biological suits
2675440	2680160	it wasn't like that it was more high-tech like those big jump suits that you zip up the back and
2680160	2685920	you can like wear a breathing apparatus in there those guys there was about 30 of them at least
2685920	2691200	and they marched right by me as i was i was being taken away they were marching to get down into
2691200	2695920	the cliff i guess they were in there to check this thing out on their black uniforms was there any
2696000	2701200	sign of rank no no rank okay no name tapes none of that but when you encounter these guys was
2701200	2705360	there any semblance that there was a hierarchy oh yeah there was definitely a yeah there was
2705360	2709520	definitely higher the team leader was he an aggressive one or oh they were all aggressive
2709520	2713920	i just i don't know man to be honest with you could you gauge the temperament of the doe team
2713920	2720000	did they seem to focus on the mission what no they were kind of like power man going crazy
2720000	2725040	running around swarming like rats yeah do they have any equipment yeah i don't know what it was
2725040	2730000	before we investigate let's quickly review jonathan's encounter with this unknown military
2730000	2735440	and scientific team near the crash site ignoring cries of danger by sergeant allen and sergeant
2735440	2740720	adkins lands corporal weigh gantt cut only 15 to 20 minutes at the crash site before two to four
2740720	2747760	us army ch 47 chinooks began to land in the nearby hasty lz climbing out of the ravine the marines
2747760	2754160	were met by operators in black camis featuring no insignia or identification these operators who spoke
2754240	2760880	with american dialects likely arrived prior to the teams in the ch 47s and disarmed and apprehended
2760880	2766160	the marines being a rambunctious young soldier weigh gantt took a swing at one of the clandestine
2766160	2771760	operators connecting his fist with the man's head these rogue operators restrained jonathan and
2771760	2777040	forcefully laid him face down on the ground where he got more of the strange clear syrupy liquid on
2777040	2782880	him while jonathan was being restrained a group of maybe 30 began walking from the landed ch 47s
2782880	2787360	down into the crash site in the ravine the personnel were comprised largely of men in
2787360	2794320	rain jackets marked delta oscar echo or do e aka the department of energy alongside these men
2794320	2799600	were multiple individuals in suits and hazmat gear jonathan described as mission oriented
2799600	2805120	protective posture or mop gear jonathan was forced to strip to his underwear discarding the
2805120	2810240	clothes covered in the mysterious liquid by the suit clad do e personnel before having his hands
2810240	2816480	cuffed feet bound and he was then carried onto a stretcher to one of the ch 47s jonathan was not
2816480	2821520	taken aboard with sergeant atkins and sergeant allen but instead isolated and forcefully taken
2821520	2827040	to an unknown camp let's pause here and break this down jonathan's mention of do e assets in
2827040	2832240	the peruvian jungle gives us some extremely actionable data points remember weigh gantt and
2832240	2837600	his fellow marines learned about the crash between 11 p.m. and midnight departed to investigate around
2837600	2842960	three to four a.m. and arrived to the crash site around six to seven a.m. from intelligence to
2842960	2850000	arrival the marines took a maximum of eight hours in roughly the same time span plus maybe an extra
2850000	2854560	hour or two if the department of energy was privy to advance signals intelligence of the
2854560	2861360	ufo being targeted possibly by peruvian hawk mim 23 missile batteries the do e was able to mobilize
2861360	2867680	american personnel assets and containment suits to secure the crash area this would imply the recovery
2867680	2874320	team was highly organized and likely a rapid reaction recovery unit this unit was able to plan
2874320	2881040	mobilize execute and contain a ufo crash retrieval site within roughly eight to nine hours remember
2881040	2886240	back to my work on us o retrievals in the deep submergence rescue vehicle under project sand
2886800	2893280	such submersibles were deployable anywhere in the world within 72 hours this 30 plus man team
2893280	2900960	was able to deploy and react to peru in roughly 11 percent of that 72 hours in numerous videos in
2900960	2907280	the past i have spoken about ufo crash retrieval rapid recovery units whether this be the use half
2907280	2914000	blue berets allegedly on site for the 1965 kexpert pennsylvania crash retrieval the blue boys rapid
2914080	2918960	retrieval and transport helicopter units relate to lennard stringfield or the rapid response
2918960	2925040	use half unit first on site to the 1953 kingman arizona crash stories of highly structured
2925040	2931680	and efficient dedicated ufo recovery units are inseparable from ufo crash retrieval testimonies
2931680	2938400	in fact wegan's description of the onsite team reminds me extremely closely of an enigmatic brutal
2938400	2945840	and perplexing ufo crash recovery case i have covered before in extreme detail the 1974 koyame
2945840	2951520	mexico ufo crash retrieval this case has very little in the form of evidence-based paper trails
2951520	2957280	but outlines an incredible and logical crash retrieval encounter in this case us intelligence
2957280	2963520	agencies specifically the cia monitored a ufo from the gulf of mexico that after a series of jagged
2963520	2969280	and abrupt turns crashed into the northern chihuahua part of mexico according to the primary
2969280	2975200	source document of this case the allegedly leaked deneve report the cia mobilized a rapid recovery
2975200	2981360	unit out of fort blitz texas this team arrived onsite from four unmarked helicopters including
2981360	2988560	uh1 huys and ch53 superstallions equipped with hazmat gear hazmat or mop gear was required at
2988560	2993200	this crash site according to the deneve report because of a whole containment breach of toxic
2993280	2999440	materials gas or liquid out of the ufo that subsequently killed the mexican military retrieval
2999440	3004800	team there is of course an argument the us rapid recovery team killed these mexican soldiers but
3004800	3011920	that is not our topic let's remain in 1974 to attempt to uncover the origins of this doe team
3011920	3017520	this year saw the creation of the department of energy and national nuclear security administrations
3017520	3025120	nuclear emergency support team formerly known as the nuclear emergency search team aka nest
3025120	3030560	previously i have labeled nest as the onsite retrieval science team wey gantt encountered
3030560	3037760	in the jungles of peru in 1997 just like other excellent researchers like rgh ufo's did before
3037760	3044000	me today however i have even stronger conviction nest handled the recovery of a non-human vehicle
3044000	3050080	and hazardous containment breach of a mysterious liquid suffered by a young marine during operation
3050080	3057360	laser strike but what is this nest nest or nuclear emergency support team was created under executive
3057360	3065200	order 12656 nest was founded as a doe specialized nuclear emergency organization that assisted the
3065200	3071040	fbi and numerous government agencies by quote providing technical expertise and advice in
3071040	3076720	response to a variety of potential incident threats involving nuclear materials end quote
3076720	3082560	analyzing a 1996 nest briefing the closest available document to the time of our crash
3082560	3088160	nest engaged in myriad deployment activities serving as an operational emergency management
3088160	3094160	team or oemt and also as a threat credibility assessor ensuring nest was the quote unquote
3094160	3100880	initial party to the scene on mission deployment sites nest would restrict access perform diagnostics
3100880	3106240	and threat mitigation actions agency planning and coordination as well as handle disablement
3106240	3113120	and cleanup in short nest operated as an umbrella organization to handle all nuclear and radiological
3113120	3118640	emergencies for the department of energy the mission of nest is to be quote prepared to respond
3118640	3125120	immediately to any type of radiological accident or incident anywhere in the world end quote around
3125120	3133520	1996 nest enjoyed its own arsenal of vehicles including high-tech vans mbb bo 105 helicopters
3133520	3140880	and numerous jets including sesna citation twos that featured a max speed of 464 miles per hour
3140880	3146480	and remember that speed as it will become quite important later on now it is crucial to mention
3146480	3152640	nest personnel did not consist of armed operators therefore it is safe to assume the operators
3152640	3158880	in black camis were not nest operators though it is possible they were still doe assets we will
3158880	3166240	get to that soon personnel in nest circa 1996 included chemists engineers health physicists
3166240	3172160	management and logistics personnel nuclear physicists analysts etc the corporate team
3172160	3177920	members of the nuclear emergency support team consisted of some familiar faces to this channel
3177920	3183680	nest forces have historically been comprised of contractors rather than the department of defense
3183680	3191040	not only did nest partner with raytheon but also e g and g los alamos national labs sandia national
3191040	3196880	labs and laurence livermore national labs as we discussed earlier a cornerstone of my work is
3196880	3202880	discussing the missing link of u.s. government corporate ufo legacy programs the subject matter
3202960	3209120	expert federally funded research and development centers or ffr dcs alongside institutions like
3209120	3215280	the mitre corporation rand corporation center for naval analyses los alamos sandia and laurence
3215280	3222080	livermore national labs operate as ffr dcs for the u.s. department of defense sandia and laurence
3222080	3228080	livermore were also directly accused by usaff master sergeant edgar fuchsia as engineering the
3228080	3234240	propulsion devices from the reverse engineered triangular craft the tr 3b i've also discussed
3234240	3241040	sandia national labs as implicated in ufo technology transfer with at and t and bell labs as well as
3241040	3247280	serving as a ufo legacy program location to house craft and biologics has outlined in the disputed
3247280	3252720	majestic 12 and interplanetary phenomenon unit documents and a quick side note while these
3252720	3258000	documents i just mentioned may be disputed the interplanetary phenomenon unit was proven to
3258080	3264160	exist through foyer requests done by ufo researcher william steinman in the 1980s however according
3264160	3270080	to the army no records of this unit existed due to it existing only through institutional memory
3270080	3276160	los alamos sandia and laurence livermore are labs intimately entwined with ufo lore quite
3276160	3281760	recently i discussed provable subterranean facilities existing below sandia and los alamos
3281760	3287600	and their possible connection to ufo legacy programs and one of nest partners e g and g
3287600	3293040	really needs no introduction this former contractor is infamous in ufo lore serving as
3293040	3298800	the contractor bob lasar claimed employed him to attempt to reverse engineer ufo propulsion devices
3298800	3304960	at area 51 s4 and e g and g's nevada parking lot also served as the meeting place for the
3304960	3311440	disputed but likely accurate 2002 wilson davis meeting notes funny enough nest themselves
3311440	3317760	in a 1995 nest assessment team report stated quote the laboratory program managers enjoy a
3317760	3323120	relatively high degree of autonomy and independence with respect to focusing efforts and funding
3323120	3328240	on those elements of their internal programs which they have deemed to be the most important
3328240	3333440	end quote this intriguing and free management style around nest laboratories arose from the
3333440	3338640	laboratory's heavy focus on research and development activities during formative years
3338720	3346080	under executive order 12656 which created nest the primary authority to nest was the 1954
3346080	3352720	atomic energy act mention of the atomic energy commission's atomic energy act of 1954 should
3352720	3359200	immediately set off alarm bells this 1954 act has been labeled specifically in the schumer
3359200	3365840	rounds legislation as a system for misclassifying ufo data and materials historically misclassifying
3365840	3372480	them as trans classified foreign nuclear information or by the acronym tfni whether the
3372480	3378320	ufo wagon encountered emitted signs of radiological signatures when tracked by laser strike radar
3378320	3384320	or intelligence agency radars matters not as ufo materials have historically been hidden within
3384320	3391200	the exact 1954 act that provided oversight to nest however it is indeed possible this craft
3391200	3397200	emitted signatures of interest to attract the eyes of the doe recently i covered a 1991 deep
3397200	3403440	sea ufo retrieval case in which a triangular craft that had sat on the sea for 30 or 40 years was
3403440	3409840	recovered by a naval dsrv crew due to survey ships recognizing radioactive signatures from the sea
3409840	3416720	floor further intriguing links exist between jonathan's testimony and nest in february of 1997
3416720	3423440	just one to two months before wagans encounter nest introduced the jtot or joint technical
3423440	3429440	operations team this team aimed to provide deployable and technical operational support for nest to
3429440	3437600	do d at even faster speeds than present nest teams and this team operated 365 days a year at 24 hours
3437600	3444080	a day let's reference diffusing armageddon inside nest america's secret nuclear bomb squad by author
3444080	3450400	jeffrey t richelson the same author of the us intelligence community that provided extremely
3450400	3456960	valuable information on the national underwater reconnaissance office around 1997 russia blasted
3456960	3463680	a probe from the bay kanor cosmodrome in kazakhstan carrying the mars 96 probe the fourth stage of this
3463680	3470320	proton rocket failed leaving the rocket unable to escape earth mars 96 did not carry an onboard
3470400	3477520	nuclear reactor but did in fact carry 18 small energy generators powered by plutonium 238 but
3477520	3483120	this was enough to get nest's attention us space command estimated the probe was large enough some
3483120	3488560	pieces would survive re-entry and the unlucky countries of origin were estimated to be bolivia
3488560	3494640	or columbia nest debated deployment to bolivia or columbia two countries considered quote-unquote
3494640	3500880	not very important but ceased action once surviving debris landed west of south america in the pacific
3500880	3506160	ocean what is interesting here is that the same year as wagans encounter nest considered deployment
3506160	3511680	to recover a probe in country's neighboring peru nest acted off intelligence gathered from us
3511680	3518640	space command and their defense support program dsp satellites and now i have made an entire video
3518640	3524960	on the subject of fast walkers a term used by us north com and norad to designate any strange
3524960	3531360	object leaving or entering earth's atmosphere at incredible speeds in the 2016 hillary clinton
3531360	3537120	campaign leaks communications were found between clinton campaign manager john pedesta and usg
3537120	3543360	contractor bob fish in these exchanges fish stated quote one of the government programs that collects
3543440	3550640	hard data on unidentified flying objects is the usaf dsp satellite program end quote in the same
3550640	3556000	video i covered an incredible dsp fast walker case related to journalist and former army
3556000	3563120	criminal investigation command agent joseph stifula this case allegedly saw a ufo traveling at 22
3563120	3570720	thousand miles per hour towards earth pass within 1.5 miles of a dsp satellite before changing course
3570720	3576800	and by the way guess which us agency has a history of developing and managing dsp satellites
3576800	3582080	yes the nr o or national reconnaissance office remember from numerous projects of mine and the
3582080	3588320	incredible articles of chris sharp the nr o has been labeled time and time again as a big five
3588320	3593840	us intelligence agency that provides various forms of satellite intelligence for ufo domestic
3593840	3599280	and foreign crash retrieval incidents all this out of jeffrey t richelson's work is to say that
3599360	3604960	there are provable instances of dsp satellites and nest working in conjunction the same year as
3604960	3610560	wagan's testimony to cover debris in south america i think for wagan's case it is highly
3610560	3617120	likely the nr o managed dsp satellites monitoring the egg-shaped crafts crashing in peru and deployed
3617120	3623360	a nest rapid recovery unit to secure the site what strengthens this thesis even more is the fact
3623360	3628880	wagan himself mentioned a bunker below the laser strike radar station that was tracking ufo's
3629280	3634000	as we discussed while performing perimeter security wagan would state how he overheard
3634000	3640240	usaff personnel discussing aircraft flying in and out of atmosphere at mock 10 plus or almost
3640240	3649360	7700 miles per hour also recall how wagan mentioned us army ch-47s deploying the doe team in a
3649360	3655920	declassified 1995 nest assessment team report we can see the doe ensured with the department of
3655920	3661440	defense that suitable military aircraft would be made immediately available to support an emergency
3661440	3667520	deployment of nest forces and equipment nest also worked closely with the us naval explosive
3667520	3673760	ordinance disposal technology division in us army 52nd ordinance group it is possible in this
3673760	3680320	instance the ch-47 belonged to nest army partners indeed the us army south did begin supporting
3680320	3687840	counter-drug operations in south america in 1995 by providing aircraft such as for uh-60a or black
3687840	3694640	hawks for such operations until one november 1997 but what i think here is that it's quite probable
3694640	3702000	these army ch-47s used to transport the nest team were from the first battalion 228th aviation regiment
3702000	3709360	one 228th aviation is part of joint task force bravo a us south com forward-based expeditionary
3709360	3714880	task force operating to promote stability and security by countering transnational threats
3714880	3720960	including narco traffic throughout the 90s jtf bravo conducted numerous missions in central
3720960	3726640	and south america and saw the us army 7th special forces we discussed earlier work alongside the
3726640	3734240	128th aviation in support of the peru ecuador 1995 border disputes and interestingly enough
3734240	3740240	throughout the 90s one 228th aviation had headquartered in panama in honduras and featured a
3740240	3746960	fleet of helicopters including ch-47 chinooks i do need to quickly mention we are faced with an
3746960	3752320	additional possibility of the origin of these helicopters as we move on to discuss the black
3752320	3758720	operators and us special forces we must also discuss the 160th special operations aviation
3758720	3764640	regiment a us army special forces special mission unit that provides helicopter aviation support
3764640	3771120	for special operations forces nickname the night stalkers the 160th often works with joint special
3771120	3776640	operations command the night stalkers are some of the army's greatest qualified aviators crew
3776640	3782720	chiefs and support soldiers and employ a massive fleet of helicopters including numerous ch-47
3782720	3787440	chinooks the night stalkers have even deployed on several missions of interest here including
3787440	3793440	recovering a down soviet helicopter in june of 1988 now there is no record of the night stalkers
3793440	3799360	performing operations in south america during the 1990s in fact closest we can get is deployment
3799360	3805680	out of panama for operation desert storm in 91 obviously with special forces operations there
3805680	3811600	would likely be next to no record of covert activities by the 160th sor in the region but
3811600	3818480	the reason i suspect the 128th aviation from jtf bravo ch-47 chinooks were used over the highly
3818480	3825120	qualified special operations force the night stalkers is because of provable ch-47s existing
3825120	3830960	under the 128th aviation and south coms domain at the time of our crash retrieval incident the
3830960	3835840	night stalkers are stationed out of fort camble kentucky and it is technically impossible for the
3835840	3840640	team to have flown chinooks to peru and commence the operation in the roughly nine hours we
3840640	3846240	outlined for the doe team but this is all to say it is very possible elements of the night
3846240	3852080	stalkers were stationed in south coms domain as part of a ufo rapid recovery team especially if
3852080	3858080	laser strike had already monitored numerous ufos but for now we are forced to look at provable
3858080	3862880	existing vehicles in the region that would satisfy the retrieval operation and now this
3862880	3868560	brings us to the armed men in black camis with no insignia i do think we are faced with a few
3868640	3874640	possibilities here in the same 1995 nest assessment team report we can see nest additionally
3874640	3880880	worked alongside us special operations and us navy special operations i have often spoke and
3880880	3886160	reflected on the work of excellent journalist chris sharp exposing the cia's office of global
3886160	3892240	access born in 2003 out of the cia directorate of science and technology the office of global
3892320	3898960	access or oga was accused by sharp as participating in foreign ufo crash recovery operations while
3898960	3904960	oga provided operational logistics and intelligence agencies provided various forms of intelligence
3904960	3910320	sharp labeled jsoc or joint special operations command as serving as the boots on the ground
3910320	3915680	force for such retrieval operations and as we discussed earlier joint special operations
3915680	3921840	command is a subordinate command within special operations command sharp myself and others have
3921840	3928640	accused jsoc in the socom as participating directly in ufo crash retrievals interestingly
3928640	3935440	jsoc is comprised of the best of the best of us special forces delta for seal team six the 24th
3935440	3940880	sts regimental reconnaissance company and the intelligence support activity the shadowy
3940880	3947040	intelligence support activity is often known as the most mysterious unit of jsoc task force orange
3947040	3953120	as it sometimes referred to was originally created under us army inscom or intelligence and security
3953120	3960320	command us army inscom was created under general albert stubblebine a figure famous in ufo lore
3960320	3965680	stubblebine showed keen interest in utilizing psi phenomena such as remote viewing for military
3965680	3970880	usage and has also been accused by numerous individuals such as philip j corso and steven
3971520	3977920	as participating directly in ufo legacy program operations at fort hachuka arizona all this is
3977920	3984320	to say i do think it is highly likely wegan encountered unmarked socom or jsoc units alongside
3984320	3990480	the doenest team the question here is were these units currently stationed in peru for laser strike
3990480	3996720	or deployed rapidly from a base similar to the doenest crew this is up for debate but i do have
3996720	4002560	my own strong thesis here let's break this down wegan did state during his deployment performing
4002560	4007600	perimeter security for laser strike he did encounter special forces operators training
4007600	4014000	as a matter of fact us special forces were deployed to peru during this time let us analyze in 1996
4014000	4020160	to 1997 document pulled from the defense technical information center titled the us military and drug
4020160	4026320	war in peru as we mentioned earlier this document details 14 special forces counter drug deployments
4026320	4033040	to peru conducted by us south com or us southern command these forces would regularly engage in
4033040	4038960	riverine training as it turns out and this will become extremely important soon us south com held
4038960	4045440	the mar forlant marine forces atlantic riverine training team in iqitos peru for utilization
4045440	4051440	under operation laser strike iqitos is a host to all sorts of us military installations of
4051440	4058080	interest we will touch on soon circling back there is the south com unit deployed to peru in 1997
4058080	4064880	we discussed earlier i highly suspect did indeed intercept wegan and his fellow marines and secured
4064880	4073200	a ufo crash site these being the us army seventh special forces unit aka the us army green berets
4073200	4078400	due to their consistent execution of us south com missions including a historical presence
4078400	4084240	training encountering narcotic distribution in central and south america especially in northern
4084240	4091040	peru i wager here the army seventh special forces were quote-unquote recruited by doe nest to serve
4091040	4097200	as the enforcement arm of a ufo crash retrieval operation now there is a secondary argument here
4097200	4103440	of who these operators could be far less likely in my opinion but still worth exploring this being
4103440	4110080	the department of energy special response team these anti-nuclear terrorist teams are the doe's
4110080	4116320	own elite task force an elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across
4116320	4122160	the continental united states the special response team has a rest on site authority and at least
4122160	4128640	in the 1980s dawned all black camis similar to the outfits described by wagan historically in the
4128800	4135920	late 90s doe srt units also provided security for sensitive doe defense nuclear facilities
4135920	4141760	including low salamos national labs and laurence livermore national labs sound familiar these
4141760	4147600	teams were trained by wacken hut wacken hut was a private security company i have talked about
4147600	4153520	extensively had historically guarded usa legacy program sites through their industrial security
4153520	4159680	expertise former cia director and director of naval intelligence admiral bobby ray inman
4159680	4164800	who admitted to nasa mission specialist bob eschler recovered ufos may one day become
4164800	4170640	available for scientific research once served as chairman of wacken hut while i can find no
4170640	4177200	data to suggest doe srt's have ever operated outside of the united states it stands to reason
4177200	4182560	such a team could travel with nest assets to incredibly sensitive materials such as a crashed
4182560	4187200	ufo protected by the 1954 atomic energy agreement act
4192400	4197120	after all our investigation into the team with delta oscar echo on their protection
4197120	4201840	suits and rain jackets as well as the armed anonymous americans and black camis i think
4201840	4207680	we can construct a powerful thesis us forces engaged in counter narcotics reconnaissance
4207680	4213840	systems for operation laser strike monitored a ufo in addition to radar it is likely the
4213840	4219760	defense support program satellites run by the nr o either picked up the same ufo or elements of
4219760	4225920	laser strike were also involved with the defense support program the ufo then crashed in wagan's
4225920	4231440	estimate this crash was caused as we discussed earlier by peruvian air force surface to air hawk
4232400	4238960	missile batteries from data gathered by intelligent sources likely dsp with support from the nr o a
4238960	4245600	doe nest retrieval team was dispatched via internal nest jet assets with a point of origin in the
4245600	4251120	mainland united states the southern most nest facility here is sandia national labs in new
4251120	4257680	mexico the nest team either departed with a doe special response team srt or leveraged green
4257680	4263920	beret special forces assets to provide on-site protection for securing the crash zone nest also
4263920	4270960	leveraged per their dod authority several us army ch47 chinooks from either the 160th soar
4270960	4278640	night stalkers or one 228th aviation from jtf bravo station nearby in us south com territory
4278640	4284000	during the crash recovery and deployment of on-site directives nest and the first to arrived armed
4284000	4289440	entourage encountered a group of marines that had happened upon the crash site first one marine
4289440	4294800	resisted detainment and was confined due to coming in contact with possibly hazardous materials
4294800	4300320	leaking from the non-human craft the young marine was stripped of his contaminated clothes by nest
4300320	4306320	personnel in biohazard suits isolated from his fellow marines and taken to a secure base with
4306320	4312400	medical facilities for quarantine interrogation and debrief the mac g28 marine was held in
4312400	4319440	isolation for up to 48 hours threatened repeatedly and forced under fear of death to sign confidentiality
4319440	4324640	agreements the marine was then driven back to his operational base where he was soon forced to
4324640	4330160	return to cherry point north carolina okay now that we have outlined our thesis let's step
4330160	4336160	back and explore this piece by piece we must start by analyzing where exactly was jonathan
4336240	4341760	wagon stationed and where may of this crash occurred operation laser strike was conducted
4341760	4347840	primarily in puculpa peru however there were two secondary locations that supported operation
4347840	4354400	laser strike and peruvian counter drug operations while also featuring tps 43 radar systems within
4354400	4360480	iqitos and andoas many familiar with the case of wagon believes he was stationed at puculpa
4360480	4365680	the primary laser strike facility and while this is indeed possible i would like to propose a
4365680	4371200	secondary possible station elements of laser strike are still classified to this day and i
4371200	4376640	know this because i've spoken to one of the marines wagon described he was with in his testimony
4376640	4381280	the marine refused to discuss many details of laser strike with me since the operation was
4381280	4387200	still classified to me this partially rules out puculpa as the base at which jonathan
4387200	4394240	alan adkins and others were stationed but why puculpa at least since 2001 has received public
4394880	4399680	as a laser strike location one of the marines i talked to his unwillingness to speak about
4399680	4405600	their base of operations leads me to believe it was not puculpa furthermore wagon stated his unit
4405600	4411920	flew into lima peru via c 130 then took a multiple hour flight with one stop to travel to their
4411920	4418480	operational base jonathan was unaware of where exactly this location was and puculpa is around
4418560	4424640	300 miles from lima at the cruise speed of a c 130 this journey from lima to puculpa would take
4424640	4430240	less than one hour however there was a laser strike location up north in peru that existed
4430240	4437200	more than 630 miles away from lima at a cruising speed a c 130 would take near two hours to complete
4437200	4443440	this journey with an added stop this satisfies our journey conditions of several hours this laser
4443440	4450400	strike location is usaf detachment five in iqitos peru detachment five is a very private
4450400	4457040	installation i can only find one mention of in the 1990s or onward iqitos is home to usaf radar
4457040	4463200	detachment five the mar forlant riverine training team discussed earlier in namru six now called
4463200	4469840	namru south aka the navy medical research unit all three of these locations significance will
4469840	4475760	become apparent very soon especially when wegan't discuss the facility he was taken to by the doe
4475760	4481680	team and the permanent structures there on site now i can find next to no information about the
4481680	4488080	andoas laser strike site but these aforementioned locations at iqitos lead me strongly to believe
4488080	4494160	iqitos is the correct location wegan't stated his radar station was tracking narcotics traffic from
4494960	4500400	analyzing narco routes from 1998 we can see drug transport routes passing directly through
4500400	4506080	iqitos peru but let's go step by step through the incident and try to reconstruct wegan't's
4506080	4512000	encounter jonathan was informed of a crashed aircraft near 11 p.m to midnight by three to four
4512000	4517360	a.m the lance corporal sergeant adkins sergeant allen's and multiple marines and humvees departed
4517360	4522640	for the crash area after a combination of driving and trekking the marines reached the crash area
4522640	4528720	as the sun was rising around six to seven a.m what this means is that from the time the marines
4528720	4534000	left their base of operations which i highly suspect is the enigmatic usaff radar detachment
4534000	4540480	five in iqitos peru to the time the marines got to the crash only between two and four hours had
4540480	4546080	elapsed but let's break this down remember wegan't claimed the marines drove humvees and
4546080	4550960	trekked to the crash area wegan't would also make mention that while he was analyzing the craft
4550960	4556880	up close he was incredibly sweaty but made no mention of fatigue due to the hiking while a
4556880	4561600	marine equipped with a full loadout and weapon would certainly get quite sweaty quickly in the
4561600	4567840	peruvian air average temperatures in march and peru are only 77 degrees fahrenheit with a sunrise
4567840	4573120	temp being much cooler due to these factors we will take the average time elapsed to the crash
4573120	4578800	site three hours and assume the marines drove for two and a half hours and trekked for 30 minutes
4578800	4584160	humvees drive at max speeds of 70 miles per hour but operate conservatively especially on
4584160	4590400	jungle terrain and roads therefore we will assume the caravan of marines traveled at 35 miles per
4590400	4595680	hour at two and a half hours of driving this means if the marines traveled in a straight line the
4595680	4601680	soldiers could have traveled near 88 miles the average human hikes at roughly two to three miles
4601680	4606880	per hour and we will assume here trained soldiers who got a pep in their step could trekk two miles
4606880	4612480	in 30 minutes with this information and a tremendous amount of error and i fully understand my
4612480	4618240	calculations are based on heavy assumptions we can assume the crash occurred in a 90 mile radius
4618240	4624400	outside of iquitos to try and correct for some of my error here i will give a plus minus of 25
4624400	4629840	percent error we are then left with this general area of where the crash may have occurred now
4629840	4635280	recall wegan did say the crash occurred just over the border but he stated the bolivian borders
4635280	4640880	specifically 5 to 10 miles from the bolivian border now if wegan's testimony is true this
4640880	4645840	means he either got the border of bolivia incorrect confusing the country with the borders of either
4645840	4651840	brazil or columbia or he was stationed at a secretive location in southeast peru that featured
4651840	4656800	multiple camps and permanent structures now i tend to believe the former and that jonathan
4656800	4662080	misspoke as his laser strike installation was tasked with tracking bolivian narco traffic
4662080	4668320	and iquitos employed a significant amount of us do d permanent structures and assets that line up
4668320	4673760	with jonathan's testimony and the timeline of events what reinforces this thesis is the point
4673760	4679120	we discussed earlier that the us army seventh special forces and joint task force bravo containing
4679120	4684960	the first battalion 228th aviation regiment had historically conducted us south com missions in
4684960	4691680	northern peru during the 1955 peru ecuador border dispute so it is interesting the men in black
4691680	4697120	camis i wager where us army seven special forces were already available to secure the crash site
4697120	4702880	in northern peru anyways we can conclude from the exploration above wegan adkins and the fellow
4702880	4708640	marines uncovered the crashed ufo 5 to 10 miles from either the columbian or brazilian border
4708640	4714160	in one of these two general regions within 15 to 20 minutes the marines arriving the crash
4714160	4720080	site was secured by multiple us army ch-47 helicopters doe personnel and armed men in
4720080	4726160	black camis wagantis certain arrived to the scene before the ch-47s it was almost like they were
4726160	4733920	there already they were on the ground already and and whoever was flying over was coming in after
4733920	4739360	they these guys had landed so i'm and i'm not sure where they landed where they were but they
4739360	4745680	were just there on top of the site within a few minutes i can't remember exactly how it's speculation
4745680	4748720	on your part you don't know for sure but you think it's possible that team may have been there first
4748720	4753600	yeah they all they were definitely there first and they were monitoring us too i'm sure they knew
4753600	4757840	we were in the area when we got up there near it but they looked army but they didn't have you
4757840	4763360	know insignia on them right they were same color and all this from the data we've discussed above
4763360	4768800	an involvement of nr row managed dsp satellites i wager this rapid reaction retrieval team had
4768800	4774560	maybe one hour advanced notice of the crash to the marines therefore let's assume this retrieval
4774560	4779920	team had a maximum of nine hours to gather intelligence assemble brief and reach the crash
4779920	4785920	site with a detailed operational plan remember at this time nes teams were historically stationed
4785920	4791600	at us department of energy laboratories so i think it is extremely unlikely any team would have
4791600	4796880	been stationed in south america at this time in this instance one of the closest major labs to
4796880	4803440	iqitos peru is a regular tricky customer of this channel central new mexico's sandia national labs
4803440	4808960	and recall back to discussing nest in the 1996 nest briefing nest was not only permitted to
4808960	4814800	commandeer any do d assets but also employed their own fleet of vehicles including sesna citation
4814800	4820880	two jets so my theory here would see a nest team departing sandia heading directly to iqitos u.s
4820960	4827200	military infrastructure via sesna citation two jets from iqitos or nearby south com installations
4827200	4832880	the team would commandeer us ch 47 helicopters likely from joint task force bravo and recruit
4832880	4839280	nearby special forces from the riverine training team or utilize a jsocker does rt team that traveled
4839280	4845200	with the nest team sandia's nearby largest city is santa fe new mexico and using santa fe as a
4845200	4852640	reference point travel distance to iqitos is 3446 miles a sesna citation two travels at
4852640	4858720	top speed of 464 miles per hour logically assuming the team wished to arrive to the retrieval site
4858720	4864160	with haste this flight would have taken around seven and a half hours from iqitos the team would
4864160	4870880	have a very short flight to arrive to the crash area around 90 to 100 miles away in a ch 47 that
4870880	4877680	travels 180 to 196 miles per hour at top speed so this journey here on the shorter end would have
4877680	4883520	taken roughly 30 minutes this means the nest team would have only required around eight hours total
4883520	4888800	of travel time with roughly one hour left for personnel and gear gathering necessary ground
4888800	4894560	briefings etc a tight squeeze but one that very well fits in the framework of wegan's testimony
4895120	4900400	and then they took me in the ch 47 and they they sent me to we we took off and
4901120	4906080	and uh and uh they they didn't drug me or anything like that and i was just awake there
4906960	4913360	and and they had me in a uh your question again is how long was i contained your subdued i don't
4913360	4918240	know for about two days i think i don't know no i don't i don't know they i didn't know where i was
4919200	4927680	because we landed and um we we we we flew and then we landed and then uh they took me out and
4927680	4932800	it was still i mean you know it's it wasn't in the same area that i was at this is more of like
4932800	4938640	there were structures prominent structures there i think was peruvian military but all this thing
4938640	4944320	man all i saw there was americans and there's a lot of other nationalities there are chinese
4944400	4947760	germans i think were there i mean a lot of other people weren't at this other base
4948480	4953440	but i mean this thing was really i mean i didn't go in and all they did was take me to like uh
4953440	4960000	like us you couldn't tell it itself was more of like uh it was more like an interrogation
4960000	4965840	but i sat in there for how long they had 15 hours land's corporal wegan was isolated from adkins
4965840	4970960	allen and the other marines he was flown to a location that was not his base of operations
4971040	4976800	which i wager was in iqitos now what's interesting is this location was close enough to his original
4976800	4981920	station that after one to two days of captivity wegan was driven back before being kept with
4981920	4987600	usaf personnel for three weeks another nod towards iqitos being the correct location with usaf
4987600	4993200	detachment five before being shipped back to cherry point at this interrogation room wegan was
4993200	4998400	contained isolated and threatened by some of the operators and black camis and was then forced to
4998400	5004000	sign documents swearing his silence by a usaf colonel describing this location wegan made a
5004000	5008960	very interesting set of remarks the location at which he was interrogated employed permanent
5008960	5014320	structures not makeshift forward operating bases like pulcapa laser strike location
5014320	5018560	it was at this base where he was interrogated he observed multiple different nationalities
5018560	5025680	in one area americans peruvians chinese and germans also recall twice wegan got the mysterious
5025680	5030560	liquid leaking from the craft on him once during his initial investigation of the crash site in a
5030560	5035840	second time when the black operators forcefully took him to the ground wegan also stated here the
5035840	5041520	doe team and hazmat gear stripped his clothes covered in the liquid due to these statements plus
5041520	5047760	wegan being isolated from adkins and allen i do think it likely the doe nest team had concerns
5047760	5053680	wegan was contaminated from interacting with the liquid for this reason i do have high suspicion
5053680	5060480	wegan was taken to namru 6 or namru south the navy medical research unit with offices in lima
5060480	5067280	peru and ikitos the us navy employs various namru locations around the globe which serve as dod
5067280	5074320	laboratories and centers namru sa at joint base san antonio texas namru 3 formally in egypt now
5074320	5081040	in siginella naval air station sicily italy namru endo pacific in singapore naval base namru south
5081120	5086880	with offices in lima and ikitos peru and namru d at right patterson air force base ohio
5087440	5092800	namru locations absolutely fit the dictionary definition of multicultural environments
5092800	5098560	namru installations serve as a network of biomedical research labs operated by the us navy
5098560	5104000	namru operates to conduct r&d on infectious diseases bio defense and numerous medical
5104000	5109680	topics related to military and public health namru is part of the navy medical research command
5109680	5115200	that conducts biomedical research to meet the needs of the navy and marine corps german
5115200	5121600	nationalists that specifically namru south are also not uncommon even in 2023 we can find examples
5121600	5127520	of german military and ambassadors visiting namru's lima location in my opinion namru would
5127520	5133200	serve as a perfect location for jonathan to be taken this location is within driving distance to
5133200	5139840	ikitos usaf detachment 5 and close to the us marfor lint riverine training team and obviously
5139840	5145520	this location is a sensible holding in quarantine zone for a us marine who is exposed to possibly
5145520	5151440	toxic materials in non-human craft now i do need to mention of course this theory is not
5151440	5157040	without its own kinks wegan stated he was only at this location for two days and while he was
5157040	5162480	contained in an interrogation type room he was still in close proximity to the usaf lieutenant
5162480	5167760	colonel that forced him to sign papers in the operator who threatened his life one might assume
5167760	5172240	wegan would have had to be quarantined for up to a week in isolation and would have had to undergo
5172240	5177600	numerous medical procedures to determine if any risk of sickness or contamination resided from the
5177600	5183680	fluid and wegan did specifically tell me he did not have to undergo any sort of medical procedures
5183680	5189360	at this location other factors at play do need to be worked through for this namru theory such as
5189360	5195120	the multi-nationals jonathan described being armed operators and not diplomats as well as this
5195120	5201200	holding location being underground remember this crash occurring near ikitos is just a theory of
5201200	5207040	mind constructed from the best available evidence for this crash retrieval testimony but even so
5207040	5212640	i do believe ikitos peru serves as the primary focus for our ufo crash retrieval and forced
5212640	5223600	holding of lance corporal jonathan wegan i have contacted countless individuals named by wegan
5223600	5229120	are possibly involved in this crash retrieval case these include multiple usaf personnel from
5229120	5234640	my keto's detachment five including lieutenant colonel gala biles second lieutenant randall
5234640	5241440	rothman and staff sergeant robert mcowd of the 649th combat logistics support squadron this outreach
5241440	5247200	was conducted in an attempt to identify if ikitos was indeed where wegan was stationed i plan to
5247200	5253520	inquire if us marines from the mac g28 performed perimeter security for the site if a doe team
5253520	5258320	ever stationed briefly at detachment five or borrowed their aircraft or if stories floated
5258320	5264240	around of a marine who went missing that turned up two days later as of today i have had no luck
5264240	5270240	contacting any usaf personnel involved in laser strike due to repeatedly hearing that some details
5270240	5275840	of the op are still classified i am not holding my breath however i will continue to pursue any and
5275840	5281840	all leads jonathan wegan did directly state a staff sergeant montaligre knew about the crash
5281840	5287120	site and that sergeant allen and sergeant adkins had both accompanied wegan to the site and observed
5287120	5295200	the crash day with 100 confidence i have identified all three of these men and all three are real usmc
5295200	5300960	veterans and enjoyed long accomplished careers with the corps after laser strike and i reached
5300960	5306480	out to all three on multiple platforms and as of this date only one marine has responded i choose
5306480	5311280	to keep the identity of this marine anonymous out of respect to the individual and to his service
5311280	5316640	to the united states i will also refrain from posting screenshots as i do not wish to break
5316640	5321760	this individual's trust nor do i have his permission to do so i reached out to these marines from
5321840	5328000	this channel's email address uapgerb at gmail.com which i highly encourage any first hand ufo legacy
5328000	5334880	program witnesses to contact this email does not contain my identity to protect my anonymity i emailed
5334880	5341040	one of these sergeants asking to talk to him about his service during laser strike in 1996 to 1997
5341040	5346800	i did also state that my outreach concerned an encounter relayed by a mac g28 lance corporal
5346800	5352320	but with held wegan's name who claimed he alongside a handful of sergeants encountered a unique
5352320	5359520	downed aircraft the sergeant responded hello and addressed me gerb by both my first and my last
5359520	5365360	name in this exchange the sergeant continued quote the operation is still classified however
5365360	5370080	there was no incident involving a unique downed aircraft that i know of or encountered during
5370080	5376080	my deployment i can speak to what never happened during my deployment and not cross the classification
5376080	5381040	restrictions of the operation and quote the sergeant reckoned i had received bad intel
5381040	5386320	regarding his involvement in the suggested incident i was pursuing i then asked the marine if he
5386320	5390800	had ever heard of a lance corporal's testimony of a crashed egg-shaped vehicle that involved
5390800	5396000	several other marines that may have been downed by human military assets such as hawk mim 23
5396000	5402000	missile batteries the marine responded he was aware of a lance corporal wegan that served under
5402160	5407440	his platoon much of this response by the sergeant focused on hawk surface to air missile systems
5407440	5413600	and the impossibility that the usmc employed a hawk battery during 1997 and of course wegan
5413600	5419360	does agree with this point hawk missile batteries were phased out of us forces in 1994 the marine
5419360	5426160	corps continued usage until 2002 but laser strike ceased usage of hawk in 1997 since his original
5426160	5430960	testimony wegan only theorized that this craft had been hit by a hawk system and that the missile
5430960	5436640	battery likely belonged to local peruvian forces and wegan held this theory due to the ballistic
5436640	5442160	and fragging pattern of damage on the egg-shaped craft wegan spent a tremendous amount of time
5442160	5448080	studying hawk mim 23 systems and maintains this conclusion to this day the sergeant not only
5448080	5453600	claimed wegan never deployed in support of operation laser strike but also stated wegan's story was
5453600	5459600	false and while he was a good young respectful obedient and dedicated marine he also suffered a
5459600	5465360	medical condition quote he was never a participant in any clandestine operations or efforts he was
5465360	5471520	just an laad marine and that was all end quote now let me be clear here i fully respect this
5471520	5476400	marine in question after all he dedicated much of his life to the service of this country but
5476400	5481520	i do have quite a few problems here with his statements jonathan wegan never once claimed
5481520	5487760	to participate in any clandestine operations this encounter simply involved a group of mac g28
5487760	5493840	marines sent out by their radar detachment to secure the lz of a downed aircraft the mac g28
5493840	5499760	marines in this testimony clearly conflicted with the clandestine mission of the do enes team
5499760	5505360	i also find the claims wegan never deployed to laser strike to be quite curious laser strike was
5505360	5510400	indeed a classified mission the marine i spoke to claimed wegan may have picked up bits and pieces
5510400	5514960	of deployment information for marines that did indeed deploy to laser strike but i find this
5514960	5520720	unlikely in wegan's testimony and all the way back to his initial outreach to steven greer on one
5520720	5526960	august 2000 the young lance corporal described operation laser strike extremely accurately
5526960	5532160	and the only detail that stands out as odd is how jonathan claimed his usaf radar base was near
5532160	5537440	the bolivian border i still maintain he likely meant iqitos near the columbian and brazilian
5537440	5544480	borders mac g28 marines from jonathan's us station cherry point north carolina did absolutely
5544480	5549840	deploy to laser strike this is a fact i find it odd wegan would not have deployed with the other
5549840	5555520	mac g28 marines for perimeter defense and low altitude aerial defense to replace the obsolete
5555520	5561520	hawk batteries similar to hit pieces on david grush i also have a tremendous issue when claims of
5561520	5566720	witnesses or whistleblowers are dismissed because of quote unquote health conditions jonathan has
5566720	5572560	been playing this incident affected his life extremely negatively from the violent interrogation
5572560	5577280	to feeling like non-human beings were calling out for his help in the craft wreckage jonathan
5577280	5583360	did not leave this incident unscathed in the slightest i must interject my own personal biases
5583360	5589280	here but i am close friends with mr wegan the man enjoys a successful career and relationships
5589280	5594720	with friends family and loved ones as far as i can tell the man does not suffer from fanciful
5594960	5597600	delusions to construct such a specific fantasy
5602480	5607280	since the witness testimony of jake barber the concept of egg shaped ufo retrievals has
5607280	5613200	grown significantly in popularity while wegan described a much larger more intricate craft
5613200	5618640	with hatches a band of light along its circumference and what seems similar to gills over barber's
5618640	5624560	suv side smooth white egg we can find multiple retrieval cases from history that share numerous
5624560	5630640	similarities to the alleged crash in peru in 1997 let's reference the work done by legendary
5630640	5637200	ufo crash retrieval researcher lenard stringfield and visit ufo crash retrieval status report three
5637200	5644480	between 1980 and 1982 stringfield became aware of one hj a sergeant in the us army 24th infantry
5644480	5650800	who was wounded during service in the korean war in july of 1953 whilst a private and b company at
5650800	5657840	camp poke louisiana a 17-year-old private hj and his unit under command of one sergeant rs were
5657840	5664640	performing duty maneuvers at dusk at roughly 7 p.m. hj's platoon observed an object that was egg
5664640	5670960	shaped crash land out in the boondocks according to hj authorities as well as a and b companies
5670960	5676720	were ordered out to the crash site at the site hj got within 15 yards of the object before a
5676720	5684000	lieutenant witting ordered company b to withdraw to 100 yards stating quote unquote peons like hj
5684000	5689040	quote had to get out of the way and quote interestingly enough we can place an actual
5689040	5694720	lieutenant witting at camp poke at this time the area around the craft was badly burned turning
5694720	5700960	nearby ground into a powdery substance like crushed brick and hj could still feel heat emanating
5700960	5706400	from the vehicle the craft was as wide as a three bedroom single story ranch house which by modern
5706400	5712640	standard estimates could be anywhere between 35 to 70 feet similarities here exist to wagons craft
5712640	5719360	estimates of 20 meters or roughly 66 feet the large ovoid object was without windows or lights and
5719360	5725440	quote was surrounded by a fin like protrusion on its equator which was still rotating end quote
5725440	5730320	another close similarity to wagons and discussion of a band of light traveling across the craft
5730320	5736640	circumference shortly after securing the site a special detachment medics an ambulance and special
5736640	5741760	equipment arrived on scene this detachment approached an open hatch on the side of the craft
5741760	5747680	after a while two medics carried away a stretcher to the ambulance containing a body three occupants
5747680	5753680	of the craft then emerged and were aided by medics seemingly injured hj would state quote one of them
5753680	5758320	kept looking at the one in the litter and made strange noises i couldn't believe what i was
5758320	5764320	seen end quote as incredible as this detail is we have discussed similar testimony before remember
5764320	5769520	back to the infographic show whistleblower testimony of a crash retrieval operator i put a lot of
5769520	5775120	stock into the witness in this program claimed in several ufo retrieval operations in which craft
5775120	5780880	were manned by biologics retrieval teams would often have to lead occupants out of the craft
5780880	5786240	these biologics were described seemingly as limited in cognitive ability possibly giving
5786240	5792640	some credence to the theory some ufo occupants are akin to biological androids that perform basic or
5792640	5797760	specific functions that night the two live ones apparently just kind of stood there as the team
5797760	5802000	entered the craft it had opened on its own maybe they opened the door i don't know if it was open
5802000	5807040	when we got there they stood there and they didn't answer the ambassador at all basically they just
5807040	5812000	barely reacted to anything just basic stimuli like turning their heads away from bright lights
5812000	5816560	they didn't even object when the medical team started looking them over for injuries or so i
5816560	5821680	was told i saw them when they were led out of the craft and i do mean they were let out like
5821680	5827040	children the medical guys grabbed them by the hand and just let them out like a kid they just sort
5827360	5832160	of stood where you left them hj described these occupants as three and a half to four feet tall
5832160	5837680	of slight build and walked as if they had no knees or very stiff bending only at the hips
5838240	5843200	hj described large heads without features leading him to believe the creatures were covered by a
5843200	5849680	helmet the biologics were a tight fitting dull metallic green uniform later on hj would somehow
5849680	5855520	learn that these biologics were sent to a hospital and quote unquote put into isolation but all died
5855520	5861440	in captivity he also learned the corpses were sent over to a medical center near washington dc
5861440	5867120	this could of course perhaps be the army's fort detrick roughly 40 miles away from dc at fort
5867120	5872400	detrick betel memorial institute manages the national biodefense analysis and countermeasures
5872400	5879200	center ffr dc i have previously implicated fort detrick alongside utah's dugway proving ground
5879200	5884640	in holding ufo biologics i highly recommend checking out my video on dugway to learn more
5884640	5890400	hj's experience at fort polk shares striking similarities to wagant but let's go even further
5890400	5896800	let's now jump to stringfield's 1991 ufo crash retrievals the inner sanctum status reports six
5896800	5902960	and investigate the case of barnabas aka albert bruce collins much of stringfield's work here
5902960	5907840	came from ufo researcher tim cooper one of the primary researchers who received significant
5907840	5913680	drops of majestic 12 documents in the 1980s also recall from my majestic 12 project with
5913680	5919600	author ryan wood how tim cooper's father usaff master sergeant harry b cooper received a special
5919600	5926160	citation from the legendary general entwined in ufo lore courtesy lemay this letter to tim cooper's
5926160	5932880	father from lemay praised harry b cooper for his work on the quote unquote usaff ufo program anyways
5932880	5939760	cooper interviewed barnabas aka albert bruce collins shortly before his 1990 new year's eve death on
5939760	5946080	20 november 1990 collins claimed to be a metallurgical engineer and retired government employee
5946080	5951120	specifically developing metal alloys used for electromagnetic propagation and magnetic field
5951120	5957840	propulsion from 1942 to the late 1950s and it is important to note i can't necessarily confirm
5957840	5963120	collins claims of an accomplished metallurgical engineering career while collins did in fact
5963120	5969040	die on 30 december 1990 all i can confirm from his obituary is he was a veteran a member of the
5969040	5976240	nra in a nature conservancy collins disclosed to cooper in 1947 he observed a ufo on a long
5976240	5981280	flatbed trailer covered with a green tarp being backed into a large warehouse at the university
5981280	5987200	of california berkeley i'm immediately reminded of us army lowboy trucks described in numerous
5987200	5994080	ufo retrieval cases such as the 1953 kingman crash and the 1965 kexburg pennsylvania crash
5994080	6000080	according to collins he stood but just 100 feet away from an oval-shaped craft described like an
6000080	6005680	egg with the shell cracked and the yoke still inside the craft was metallic similar to polished
6005680	6011040	aluminum with a silvery looking finish similar to wagant's case this egg featured a seam at the
6011040	6016800	edge all the way around collins guessed this craft suffered an internal explosion with the metal
6016800	6022080	exterior of the craft seemingly pushed out the retrieval had sustained significant amounts of
6022080	6027840	damage with a large section ripped off in a huge gash on top running down the side below the seam
6027840	6032720	from his 100 foot away vantage point collins observed a bulkhead in front with multi-layered
6032720	6038400	honeycomb skin the interior was dark but similar to the egg analogy there was a shiny sphere in
6038400	6043040	the center of the craft surrounded by another bulkhead the craft additionally featured a
6043040	6048720	forward compartment but collins could not see inside the vehicle was 30 to 40 feet in diameter
6048720	6054400	and roughly 15 feet high these dimensions are slightly smaller than the craft wagant described
6054400	6060080	but why even mention this short story of collins with no supporting documentation or even verification
6060080	6065840	of his work history as a metallurgical engineer well this is because in his 1990 interview with
6065840	6071040	tim cooper collins additionally disclose some information that may just raise your eyebrow
6071040	6076320	not only did collins claim to have studied metal of unknown composition and origin in an official
6076400	6082880	capacity but also claimed at this time 1949 he learned of a multitude of agencies involved in
6082880	6088720	tuo or technologies of unknown origin research this included intelligence offices from the
6088720	6096000	u.s. army air force and navy the cia the rand corporation founded just one year prior in 1948
6096000	6102480	and the vatican collins even claimed to have learned of multiple projects between these agencies
6102480	6108160	archangel between the cia rand and vatican black book under the air force the infamous
6108160	6113760	blue book under the air force white book between the cia and vatican and yellow book which served
6113760	6119440	as a scientific panel of an unknown government scientific review board while discussing these
6119440	6125120	projects collins added he had heard los alamos national labs had been studying green fireballs
6125120	6130720	and strange debris found in the desert and this last piece of data is what lends credence to some
6130720	6136640	of collins words as the atomic energy commission did indeed create a project twinkle in the late
6136640	6144080	40s and early 50s that analyzed ufo's including green fireballs at los alamos sandia white sands
6144080	6149120	and hauleman air force base of course this isn't our topic for today but these joint
6149120	6154640	projects with the vatican are highly interesting i have covered this case before but let's briefly
6154720	6161120	circle back to the 1933 magenta italy ufo crash retrieval case according to the case as well as
6161120	6166000	david grush in the late herald malmgren vatican intelligence alerted the united states of the
6166000	6172560	lenticular disk in axis possession this in turn allowed the us to capture this ufo saucer post
6172560	6178480	world war two it's incredible to then consider joint u.s vatican ufo programs that followed world
6178480	6184000	war two collins is quite the enigma and possibly in the future we will return to analyze further
6184000	6189200	claims of his included knowledge in project arc angel that determined some ufo occupants were
6189200	6194640	biological extraterrestrials there are many cases of egg shaped or tear drop shaped ufo
6194640	6199520	retrieval operations we just don't have the time to cover today i would also like to point to the
6199520	6207120	1973 great lake naval base rk testimony i covered in my previous naval ufo legacy programs project
6207120	6212800	in which gunnery school instructor rk observed a 30 foot long and 10 foot high tear drop shaped
6212800	6218160	ufo resting on a wooden platform in a quonset style hangar in the great lakes naval station
6218160	6223600	illinois this craft was allegedly shot down via a naval destroyer and picked up in the pacific
6223600	6230400	ocean by the national underwater reconnaissance officers glomar explorer hey guys it's grub and
6230400	6235520	i'd like to thank each and every single one of you for joining me on this very special investigation
6235520	6241920	into lance corporal jonathan wagan now those of you new to my videos will now know one this is an
6241920	6246720	ai and two this is where after the video i kind of do an off script kind of rant if you want to
6246720	6250800	call it and give my thoughts on the video give my thoughts on the investigation and kind of summarize
6250800	6255200	everything we've talked about returning viewers of this channel will probably know this is a very
6255200	6261280	special video as one of my first ever projects was on jonathan wagan but of course at that time
6261280	6265280	i didn't know jonathan i didn't have a relationship with him nor did i have the
6265280	6270560	investigative skills the video editing skills the research skills the writing skills to craft
6270560	6278400	such a project now originally the plan here was just to do an interview with wagan and so after
6278400	6284080	many months of knowing him and forming a friendship i went out to where he resides i'm not going to
6284080	6288320	go ahead and spill that but it's in the south as you can probably tell from his accent some of the
6288320	6294240	other accents we heard and i was fortunate enough to have my friend kermit uh frog and badger i've
6294240	6299760	had him on a live before right after the november 14 2024 hearings he was able to meet me out there
6299760	6303840	and help film and so forth so i want to give a huge shout out to him guys he's a great friend of
6303840	6309280	this channel i'd like to have him on some more lives uh he just on the drop of a pencil decided
6309280	6314240	to come up and help so huge shout out but this originally was planned to just be an interview
6314240	6320480	with wagan and as he and i started talking and as i started to sit with some of our conversations i
6320480	6327520	thought well maybe let's break this down a little bit and do a two-part series first wagan back in
6327520	6335120	2000 gave so much information really actionable information down to the does team due to names
6335120	6341280	and you guys know on this channel how much we love when names are given and in 2023 he offered
6341280	6347360	little new information so i thought why don't jonathan and i sit down and really iron out
6347360	6352720	some of the finer details of what he remembers because guys time is slipping away this incident
6352800	6358720	occurred according to jonathan in 1997 so we're pushing on 30 years here but i wanted to get some
6358720	6364480	of those details out and work out an investigation and then sit down and do an interview with jonathan
6364480	6369280	you guys know how i work i really want the firm foundation laid out before he and i sit down and
6369280	6376560	talk so i do plan on returning with him and kind of getting a more relaxed interview style of him
6376560	6380880	just speaking about his life speaking about his life before and after and so forth so that's
6380960	6386400	going to be coming down the pipeline but this project i thought it pertinent to to start digging
6386400	6390800	into some of the details with jonathan and then be able to do my own research and exploration
6390800	6396160	some of these added details included jonathan describing that the men in black kames where
6396160	6402480	they're on site first that was a huge question i had going into this whether uh to kind of ponder
6402480	6409680	if that team arrived on the ch-47s with the doe nest probably team or that they had arrived first
6409680	6413840	now the fact they arrived first according to jonathan gives even more credence to these were
6413840	6418480	local special forces now of course he didn't describe team any vehicles but in my opinion
6418480	6423920	the seventh army green berets probably utilized humbies or nearby vehicles to arrive on scene first
6424800	6430560	another key point here was the multinational group that these germans these chinese they were all
6430560	6436640	armed now that is a massive detail as well and one that i'm still trying to to solve here because
6436720	6441520	of course we've heard of multinational recovery team specifically with five eyes nations and
6441520	6445920	canadian politician larry maguire kind of writing to his own minister of defense in
6445920	6451280	canada saying we need to get information about uap because of five eyes projects and maybe retrieval
6451280	6457200	teams and another huge detail he talked about was him thinking the men in black camis were army
6457200	6463600	due to the helmets they had now if you're unfamiliar with military various factions of military army
6463600	6470160	marines navy all of their infantry and soldiers utilize different helmets so being able to track
6470160	6474880	down the helmets or kind of the caps they had wagon thought these guys were army and that's a huge
6474880	6481360	detail to to try and track down i also really enjoyed him talking about mop gear and varying
6481360	6486800	levels of that and that gives even more credence to me for the nest team varying levels of protection
6486800	6493280	versus how close and proximity these men would get to the craft now jonathan's testimony is of
6493280	6500000	course truly startling one of the big questions remains now is what happened to the craft after
6500000	6505920	and jonathan and i talked about this i i decided not to include it here because it's it's speculation
6505920	6511360	with very little basis here but that that's a very interesting question to me this craft was lodged
6511360	6518560	into a granite cliff face almost how was it taken out how was it retrieved because if we're talking
6518560	6524400	about c47s and the night stockers sure they may have airlifted some kind of picked apart soviet
6524400	6530480	helicopters before but how do you get a craft of non-human origin a massive one and what are some
6530480	6536000	of the logistics here where the biologics taken out first was the rest of the liquid contains
6536720	6542320	and then taken out and what went on here and i do think one of the interesting parts of this story
6542320	6548480	is the liquid now as we dug into it jonathan and myself he kind of theorized that you know
6548480	6552960	maybe this liquid wasn't just a fuel a propulsion system but he thought because some liquid was
6552960	6557040	coming out of the recessed hole the hatch that was open where he saw the biologic hanging out
6557040	6562480	that water was coming from there that this craft may have been filled with water and that brings
6562480	6568240	up the question what if the species he encountered were almost an aquatic species that lived in the
6568240	6573920	water and the craft contained almost an aquarium or a closed system of water of sorts i think these
6573920	6578960	questions are highly interesting to ponder i think one of the most fruitful and frustrating avenues
6578960	6586160	of this research was reaching out to the fellow marines adkins alan and montaligre total i probably
6586160	6593440	reached out to 10 people connected with laser strike only one responded to me and that was one
6593440	6599120	of the marines that wagant claimed he was with now it is important to note here all three of those
6599120	6607680	marines montaligre alan and adkins all went career usmc they all retired enlisted but it retired
6607680	6612160	with very prestigious positions in marines i'm not saying there's a connection there but it is
6612160	6618080	interesting to see that jonathan kind of got made an example of and left the marines in 98 admitted
6618080	6622800	to using controlled substances so he could get out of the marines but these other guys enjoyed
6622800	6627520	very long careers now the one that responded to me again i'm not going to burn his name just because
6627520	6632320	i you know unlike brad s in the flux liner he hasn't sent me death threats so i'm not going to burn
6632320	6641280	his name or post any sort of screenshots of messages but i was a little displeased with how
6641280	6646560	he treated jonathan i said in the video and i'll say it again i i don't think that whistleblower
6646560	6652160	testimony should be kind of boiled down to saying that the witness just has mental issues i've seen
6652160	6657440	it before i'm sure we'll see it again this reminds me to the team leader of michael herera nathan who
6657440	6662320	just said that michael was crazy because he enjoyed lifting weights and spending time alone
6662320	6670000	whilst deployed and i find arguments like that to be to not have much in him now i would always
6670000	6674800	find it weird when contacting this marine most of his story would go just towards the impossibility
6674800	6679680	of usmc having hawk batteries improved at that time and i agree with that jonathan agrees with that
6679760	6683040	but he always said no the story's false the story can't be true because we didn't have
6683040	6688080	hawk batteries the lance corporal story is false so that's kind of a mute point to me but i also
6688080	6694000	think it's strange he said that jonathan never deployed to puculpa or to laser strike when mac g
6694000	6700000	28 marines very well indeed according to our laser strike documentation did deploy so that's a bit
6700000	6707600	of a curious point now of course i try and be as objective as i can in my videos but in the end of
6707600	6713280	my videos i tend to give my opinion guys i i do believe the encounter of jonathan wagan and i
6713280	6717120	believe it for a couple reasons not just talking to jonathan but talking to kind of people not
6717120	6722400	connected with this i i do have conviction that this case is is real i think it's one of the most
6722400	6728640	extraordinary encounters of a downed ufo craft of all time that being said there's still mysteries
6728640	6734240	here with this case of course time slipping away so jonathan is remembering fewer and fewer details
6734960	6738560	i commend him for being able to say when he doesn't remember because this was 30 years ago
6738560	6743440	and as impactful as such an event would be there are going to be things he can't quite remember
6743440	6750720	like insignias on people's uniforms or tiny little details of the makeup of notches on a craft or the
6750720	6755600	digits on an arm hanging out these things i don't blame him for being able to recall and i commend
6755600	6760480	him for saying i'm speculating here or i don't recall when he doesn't know something but i i do
6760480	6766400	think this is a a case that did occur what happened to the craft we could only guess did it get taken
6766400	6772720	to the office of naval research because i suspect namru the naval because i suspect namru south had
6772720	6778960	some sort of implications here was their transfer of materials or liquid up to namru up in bright
6778960	6785440	paterson who knows now that being said my theory of of namru and my theory of iqitos and my theory
6785440	6790240	of the seventh this does still need work i think it's a strong thesis but of course we can't concrete
6790880	6796560	prove this the biggest take up here is of course namru being the location where wagon was held
6796560	6802160	versus him not receiving any medical treatment i do think this interesting that the doe personnel
6802160	6809120	probably nest you know i i think at this point it's almost a mute point to sit to try and argue
6809120	6814400	that it's not nest but he was stripped of his clothes clearly his clothes were taken off as soon
6814400	6818800	as he encountered the liquid when he was beaten by the other marines separated from adkins and
6818800	6822800	allen who knows what happened to them who knows what happened to the seven plus other marines
6822800	6826720	that were not in the vanguard that may have seen the craft that may have not made it down the ridge
6826720	6832880	wagon doesn't know and he was put into isolation threatened and so on so i think because he took
6832880	6837520	a swing at one of these men he was both made an example of and because he encountered the liquid
6837520	6843600	there was a contamination threat but he didn't receive medical procedures is this a substance
6843600	6848400	that the doe nest team and retrieval teams are familiar with and maybe it's just like a slightly
6848400	6853120	acidic goopy water with the consistency of syrup so they weren't really worried but they wanted to
6853120	6857360	get those clothes off and maybe but that's all just speculation so is namer but i do think that
6857360	6863280	kind of fits the bill for a marine that came into contact with a non-human fluid get him isolated but
6863280	6867360	again he said this location was underground perhaps namer has underground facilities perhaps this
6867360	6874800	was nearby and i do think it's interesting he was driven back to his base now i need to get in
6874880	6878560	contact with somebody else stationed at raider detachment five which i really have tried to see
6878560	6882320	if there were a mac g 28 marines there because this would really solve quite a bit of this
6882320	6886400	but i do think it's interesting with the mar forlant training team and the special forces there
6886400	6892400	and all of the history of special forces whether that be the first one 228th aviation regiment or
6892400	6896880	the seven special forces up there in northern peru in history now of course this retrieval
6896880	6902080	team could be a dedicated j-soc or former j-soc or so-called retrieval team that station in south
6902080	6906880	america maybe howard air force base and panama maybe somewhere else to react to these this would
6906880	6910240	fit in our time frame of retrieval too because i know i gave about nine hours it could be plus
6910240	6914640	or minus an hour even to that i have a lot of air here they could be stationed for south american
6914640	6918320	retrievals we just don't know i'm just trying to work with the best available evidence we have
6918320	6923760	and try and reconstruct the testimony so of course in my theory there's a lot of assumptions there
6923760	6928800	and i was the first to say that there's a lot of assumptions and if you have a competing theory
6928800	6932400	of how this played out please let me know i'd love to hear it because at the end of the day i'm
6932400	6936320	just trying to take some of the pieces of evidence and fit them into a theory and i do think it's
6936320	6940560	strong but it is open to interpretation and probably open to error so if you have something
6940560	6944560	better there or something you think is stronger let me know i'd love to talk more about this case
6945120	6949600	speaking of let me know what you guys think in the comments because i know so many people have
6949600	6954000	wanted to hear more from weigand and i'm thrilled this has some exclusive conversations with him
6954000	6959920	for the first time really in since 2000 because on the martin willis show he he didn't really shed
6959920	6964880	new light on any details um i almost got the sense he didn't quite want to be there so
6964880	6969280	i was really glad weigand and i could form a friendship and then kind of sit down on camera
6969280	6975360	together and he was really nervous about being on camera he doesn't like it he's a very different
6975360	6979680	person on camera versus not on camera it makes him very uncomfortable he's a very private guy
6979680	6986320	always has been he was very animated in 2000 and he just it took him a lot to get over the
6986320	6992160	fear of going on camera then took him a lot of fear going on camera in 2023 and now so with that
6992160	6997040	being said guys this is about the time i tell everybody of course i do have a patreon i don't
6997040	7002240	gatekeep any content there's no extra content on there i don't have time to make extra content
