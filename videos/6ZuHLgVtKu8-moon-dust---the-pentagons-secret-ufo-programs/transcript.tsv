0	5600	I thought it was totally nuts and I thought at first I was being deceived, it was a ruse.
5600	10640	People started confiding in me, they approached me, I have plenty of current former senior
10640	15240	intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career, that
15240	19760	confided in me they were a part of a program, they named the program, I've never heard
19760	21360	of it.
21360	28440	Forget little green men, forget Area 51, forget Bob Lazar, and get any sort of conspiracy
28440	30840	out of your mind for just a second.
30840	37560	It's no longer just speculation or even a secret that within the US Department of Defense
37560	45800	lies a shadowy UFO reverse engineering and crash retrieval program with access so exclusive,
45800	49840	only a couple hundred people in the 80 plus year history of the program has ever been
49840	51280	read in.
51280	57920	People like David Grush and legislation like Schumer's 2024 NDAA legacy programs have
57920	63100	helped turn a former conspiracy into an outrageous fact.
63100	67360	Sometimes it feels like details, names, and operations of these programs will never come
67360	73520	to life, that those in the know in the defense industry will cling to secrecy until they're
73520	75840	dying breaths.
75840	82160	Though actually receiving transparency may sometimes feel like a distant fever dream,
82160	86200	you know your host UAP Gerb has you.
86200	92960	Join me today and we will venture into Project Moondust and follow the astounding paper trail
92960	98760	of one possible DOD UFO crash retrieval program.
98760	104960	Edward J. Ruppelt conducted the first ever official US government study into the UFO phenomena
104960	109680	under Project Grudge in 1948 to 1949.
109680	115320	He went on to serve as the director of Project Sign and Blue Book, the subsequent US government
115320	120240	official UFO investigation programs in the 20th century.
120240	127280	During his time as director, Ruppelt concluded UFOs had a quote interplanetary explanation.
127280	134840	On the 24th of April 1952, Ruppelt suggested programs parallel to the official USG investigation
134840	140080	were quote, conducting a more complete investigation.
140080	145960	This same conclusion was derived by J. Allen Heineck, the scientific advisor to Project
145960	147080	Blue Book.
147080	152200	We talked about him in the alien and UFOs obscure oddities iceberg layer two, so if you want
152200	154640	to know more, read there.
154640	161440	But Heineck additionally said that alongside Blue Book, there were other classified programs
161440	164120	going on studying UFOs.
164120	169960	One of these projects could have been an inconspicuous crash retrieval program, one
169960	176360	that unless you look hard enough, you'll never know existed, and that of course is
176360	179560	Project Moondust.
179560	186560	The first mention of Moondust can be traced back to 1961 in a US Air Force document titled
187200	191480	AFCIN-1E-0 Draft Policy.
191480	198000	This proposal suggests that the USAF 1127th received collection responsibility duties
198000	206280	for the USAF's established program for investigation of reliably reported unidentified flying objects
206280	208800	within the United States.
208800	214180	The memo also lists one project that has historically had this duty.
214180	220260	That project is Moondust, which has the authority to locate, recover, and deliver descended
220260	223020	foreign space vehicles.
223020	228460	And as we can see in this 1967 review for the Assistant Chief of Staff for the Intelligence
228460	235700	Community, which details the functions of the 1127th USAF Field Activities Group, Moondust
235700	242700	is shown to not just be a proposal, but exists, and has historically dealt with some terrestrial
242700	244340	space vehicles.
244340	252060	In fact, in the 1967 year, Moondust captured a total of 49 fallen Soviet space objects
252060	255660	and 17 US space objects.
255660	261460	And this is followed by a large redacted portion of the memo.
261460	266700	Now we know that Moondust had real collection responsibilities with Soviet American and
266700	269020	redacted space vehicles.
269020	274060	So let's start to take a look at some of Moondust's work.
274060	283620	As early as 1961, Moondust was in fact investigating UFOs and acting on UFO reports.
283620	291420	In this internal memo, in Pakistan, on April 25, 1961, Moondust recorded observations of
291420	300260	three cigar-shaped UFOs flying in a close delta formation above Karachi, Pakistan.
300260	304980	But Moondust wasn't just investigating UFO reports.
304980	309260	In fact, it was actively engaged in UFO collection.
309260	312760	Let's travel to 1968 in Nepal.
312760	319500	In this memo, the Defense Intelligence Department monitors a crashed circular metal disc discovered
319500	321260	in Nepal.
321260	328500	Four months after, the State Department cable titled Moondust, right to the DIA, 1127th,
328500	334180	and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base that a diplomatic visit to Kathmandu, Nepal, was
334180	339580	a, quote, fishing expedition for info on space objects.
339580	346620	Additional cables show Royal Nepali Army showed photos of these space objects to US offices.
346620	352180	A possible cover story was then constructed here of a crashed satellite, despite NORAD
352180	358740	and NASA data showing a 100% successful satellite launch rate in 1968.
358740	364800	Unfortunately the trail stops here, so I cannot tell you if this circular metal disc was actually
364800	367780	recovered by US entities.
367780	371900	Now let's fast forward a little bit to the 1970s.
371900	379260	In Canada in 1976, a memo achieved via the Freedom of Information Act shows that Moondust
379260	384820	wrote to Canadian officials requesting photos of space-related metals originating from
384820	389480	a non-US, quote, satellite.
389480	395540	That would be of particular interest to USF foreign technology divisions at Wright-Patterson
395540	400180	Air Force Base and to the CIA's Office of Weapon Intelligence.
400180	405720	Now Canada has historically been very open on investigating UFOs and participating in
405720	411380	UFO analysis with other Five Eyes nations, but that is another video for another day.
411380	417100	I want you to take particular note of the last two entries and how various memos and
417100	420940	cables have been written to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
420940	427740	If you remember an entry from Layer 2 of the Alien and UFOs of Skiur-Ottodies Iceberg,
427740	432460	you remember that Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is connected with the phenomena.
432460	438540	Wright-Patterson is often seen as a hub where crash retrievals of UFOs are stored.
438540	440300	Think of the Roswell case.
440300	445500	Allegedly, the crash materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
445500	450080	And think of Senator Barry Goldwater, who asked Wright-Patterson officials to see the
450080	456620	room where, quote, it was stored and was laughed off and told never to ask again.
456620	464100	Now if we fast forward to 1978 in New Zealand, Moondust investigates space fragments found
464100	470420	in New Zealand described as spherical or like a pressure vessel.
470420	475500	Note how this pressure vessel shape is very similar to Commander David Fraver's tic-tac
475500	481340	sighting, in which he describes the craft he observed as similar to a propane tank or
481340	485820	pressure vessel without any inlets or outlets.
485820	492500	And finally we arrive at my favorite case involving Project Moondust.
492500	495660	Everybody has heard about the Roswell crash.
495660	501820	Now not everybody knows most countries have their own sort of Roswell story in which some
501820	508860	sort of anomalous craft has hit the ground and some sort of retrieval is underway.
508860	513460	You can think of Canada's Shag Harbor for instance, maybe I'll make a video on Roswells
513460	519540	around the world if you're interested, but you may have never heard of the 1978 Bolivia
519540	521580	UFO crash.
521580	527380	This alleged retrieval was brought to my attention by the work of the UAP Caucus, a legislative
527380	533780	group on UAP initiative backed by members of Congress including Representative Timbershet,
533780	539540	Rep Anna Paulina Luna, Rep Eric Bertelsen, and Rep Jared Moskowitz.
539540	542540	The story famous in Bolivia goes.
542540	551420	On May 6, 1978 at 4.15pm, thousands of people near El Tayer Bolivia witnessed a cylindrical
551420	558500	object crash into the mountainside, creating a sonic boom that was heard up to 150 miles
558500	564500	away and cracked window panes as far as 30 miles in radius.
564500	569340	A local army corporal named Natalio Ruiz actually witnessed the UFO.
569340	575820	Sane flew above his head and resembled a gigantic wine container emitting a trace of white smoke.
575820	580100	Bolivian military and three jets were dispatched to check the wreckage.
580100	585100	Upon discovering the wreckage, the local military and police were quoted as sane.
585100	590340	Our men have discovered the object and inspected it, but have received no further instruction
590340	591980	or further action.
591980	596540	It is a dull metallic cylinder, 12 feet long with a few dents.
596540	602780	No one knows what is inside it, and we are waiting the arrival of various technical commissions.
602780	607420	A NASA expert is also expected to arrive tomorrow morning.
607420	613940	And of course, two U.S. Army Air Force officers, Colonel Robert Simmons and Major Jesse Hayes,
613940	614940	arrived.
614940	620500	Subsequently, secret documents finally obtained through the Freedom of Information Act were
620500	624660	sent to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
624660	630220	In this document, Vance writes that appropriate government agencies have been contacted regarding
630220	632180	this crash.
632180	638100	And I'm sure that you can guess the appropriate agency, Moondust.
638100	642660	Moondust received a film showing the object by the Bolivian military, and were tasked
642660	645500	with monitoring the situation.
645500	651620	Unfortunately, the trail of Moondust's involvement with this fascinating case ends here.
651620	657100	I don't know if they retrieved this craft or did nothing else.
657100	658100	I don't know.
658100	662060	And it absolutely eats at me that I can't find out what happened.
662060	664620	Let's skip forward to 1992.
664620	671700	New Mexico Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici made inquiries to the Air Force about
671700	673900	Project Moondust.
673900	679780	In response, the Air Force said that there is no Project Moondust.
679780	682660	These missions have never existed.
682660	688460	The Senators responded with documents challenging this, and the Air Force revised its previous
688460	694620	statement acknowledging the existence and function of Moondust with regards to UFOs.
694620	701740	Then in 1994, Senator Domenici requested 11 documents pertaining to Moondust from the
701740	703660	Air Force.
703660	711220	The Air Force claimed that the projects no longer existed, nor do their files.
711220	716500	Classified reports that may have possibly existed were destroyed.
716500	719100	But this is categorically false.
719100	724340	Why would the Air Force state that documents had been destroyed when requested by a U.S.
724340	725780	Senator?
725780	731580	Why did the Air Force deny the existence of Project Moondust?
731580	737740	And why did they cling on to claiming that any record of the program was destroyed?
737740	740540	I've thought about this.
740540	745140	And do you remember in the Wilson Davis video, when Admiral Thomas Wilson claims that in
745140	752340	the early 90s, special access programs were reorganized to hide the crash retrieval and
752340	758820	reverse engineering programs within SAPOX, basically making them inaccessible to everybody?
758820	764620	When did these Senators ask for documents on Moondust, the mid-90s?
764620	770260	Were these documents destroyed and any sort of involvement denied by the Air Force occur
770260	775260	because of this reorganization and compartmentalization of programs?
775260	777380	I think so.
777380	783900	It's also important to note that in this time from 1969 to 2008, Project Blue Book to
783900	789860	OSAP, there was no official U.S. government UAP investigation group.
789860	795620	So this is what I'd like to consider the dark ages, the completely hidden era of UFO
795620	797340	investigation.
797340	803380	The Air Force clung on to denying the existence of Moondust.
803380	805860	And that is where our paper trail ends.
805860	813200	It's quite plausible that the Air Force destroyed the majority of files pertaining to Moondust.
813200	818480	In order to hide a crash retrieval program of UFOs.
818480	823200	My friends, thank you for joining me to take a look through Project Moondust.
823200	825120	I hope you learned something today.
825120	830720	I hope you learned that, you know, even though sometimes it may seem impossible to crack
830720	834560	what the United States government and defense industry and intelligence industry have been
834560	839360	up to in regards to UFOs, it is possible with enough digging.
839360	841160	I want to know in the comments what you guys think.
841160	846600	Do you think Moondust has historically been, or was at least at one point, responsible
846600	853720	for collecting UAP, or do you think it was just involved in collecting foreign and domestic
853720	856480	space vehicles because I do not?
856480	858040	I absolutely do not.
858040	865320	There's a couple other programs such as Zodiac, Blue Fly, the CIA's Office of Global Access,
865320	869840	and a couple more unacknowledged programs I'd like to cover in the future, so stay tuned
869840	870840	for that.
870840	874560	But please, if you don't mind, give a like and subscribe, it really helps the channel
874560	878320	and I am astounded at how this community has grown so far.
878320	883360	It's incredible to see people with the same passion for UFOs that I have kind of engaged
883360	889200	in the comments and watch these videos, so I gotta give you my deepest gratitude, because
889200	891280	I am forever thankful.
891280	895160	I will catch you guys for the next video, and thank you for tuning in, bye.
