1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
I thought it was totally nuts and I thought at first I was being deceived, it was a ruse.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,640
People started confiding in me, they approached me, I have plenty of current former senior

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,240
intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career, that

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,760
confided in me they were a part of a program, they named the program, I've never heard

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,360
of it.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:28,440
Forget little green men, forget Area 51, forget Bob Lazar, and get any sort of conspiracy

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
out of your mind for just a second.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,560
It's no longer just speculation or even a secret that within the US Department of Defense

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:45,800
lies a shadowy UFO reverse engineering and crash retrieval program with access so exclusive,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,840
only a couple hundred people in the 80 plus year history of the program has ever been

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
read in.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,920
People like David Grush and legislation like Schumer's 2024 NDAA legacy programs have

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,100
helped turn a former conspiracy into an outrageous fact.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,360
Sometimes it feels like details, names, and operations of these programs will never come

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,520
to life, that those in the know in the defense industry will cling to secrecy until they're

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,840
dying breaths.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,160
Though actually receiving transparency may sometimes feel like a distant fever dream,

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,200
you know your host UAP Gerb has you.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,960
Join me today and we will venture into Project Moondust and follow the astounding paper trail

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,760
of one possible DOD UFO crash retrieval program.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,960
Edward J. Ruppelt conducted the first ever official US government study into the UFO phenomena

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,680
under Project Grudge in 1948 to 1949.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,320
He went on to serve as the director of Project Sign and Blue Book, the subsequent US government

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,240
official UFO investigation programs in the 20th century.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,280
During his time as director, Ruppelt concluded UFOs had a quote interplanetary explanation.

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,840
On the 24th of April 1952, Ruppelt suggested programs parallel to the official USG investigation

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,080
were quote, conducting a more complete investigation.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,960
This same conclusion was derived by J. Allen Heineck, the scientific advisor to Project

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Blue Book.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,200
We talked about him in the alien and UFOs obscure oddities iceberg layer two, so if you want

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,640
to know more, read there.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,440
But Heineck additionally said that alongside Blue Book, there were other classified programs

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,120
going on studying UFOs.

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,960
One of these projects could have been an inconspicuous crash retrieval program, one

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,360
that unless you look hard enough, you'll never know existed, and that of course is

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Project Moondust.

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,560
The first mention of Moondust can be traced back to 1961 in a US Air Force document titled

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,480
AFCIN-1E-0 Draft Policy.

39
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,000
This proposal suggests that the USAF 1127th received collection responsibility duties

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,280
for the USAF's established program for investigation of reliably reported unidentified flying objects

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,800
within the United States.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,180
The memo also lists one project that has historically had this duty.

43
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,260
That project is Moondust, which has the authority to locate, recover, and deliver descended

44
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,020
foreign space vehicles.

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,460
And as we can see in this 1967 review for the Assistant Chief of Staff for the Intelligence

46
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:55,700
Community, which details the functions of the 1127th USAF Field Activities Group, Moondust

47
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,700
is shown to not just be a proposal, but exists, and has historically dealt with some terrestrial

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,340
space vehicles.

49
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:12,060
In fact, in the 1967 year, Moondust captured a total of 49 fallen Soviet space objects

50
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,660
and 17 US space objects.

51
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,460
And this is followed by a large redacted portion of the memo.

52
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,700
Now we know that Moondust had real collection responsibilities with Soviet American and

53
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,020
redacted space vehicles.

54
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,060
So let's start to take a look at some of Moondust's work.

55
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:43,620
As early as 1961, Moondust was in fact investigating UFOs and acting on UFO reports.

56
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:51,420
In this internal memo, in Pakistan, on April 25, 1961, Moondust recorded observations of

57
00:04:51,420 --> 00:05:00,260
three cigar-shaped UFOs flying in a close delta formation above Karachi, Pakistan.

58
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,980
But Moondust wasn't just investigating UFO reports.

59
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,260
In fact, it was actively engaged in UFO collection.

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,760
Let's travel to 1968 in Nepal.

61
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,500
In this memo, the Defense Intelligence Department monitors a crashed circular metal disc discovered

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,260
in Nepal.

63
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,500
Four months after, the State Department cable titled Moondust, right to the DIA, 1127th,

64
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,180
and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base that a diplomatic visit to Kathmandu, Nepal, was

65
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,580
a, quote, fishing expedition for info on space objects.

66
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,620
Additional cables show Royal Nepali Army showed photos of these space objects to US offices.

67
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,180
A possible cover story was then constructed here of a crashed satellite, despite NORAD

68
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,740
and NASA data showing a 100% successful satellite launch rate in 1968.

69
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,800
Unfortunately the trail stops here, so I cannot tell you if this circular metal disc was actually

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,780
recovered by US entities.

71
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,900
Now let's fast forward a little bit to the 1970s.

72
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:19,260
In Canada in 1976, a memo achieved via the Freedom of Information Act shows that Moondust

73
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,820
wrote to Canadian officials requesting photos of space-related metals originating from

74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,480
a non-US, quote, satellite.

75
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,540
That would be of particular interest to USF foreign technology divisions at Wright-Patterson

76
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,180
Air Force Base and to the CIA's Office of Weapon Intelligence.

77
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,720
Now Canada has historically been very open on investigating UFOs and participating in

78
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,380
UFO analysis with other Five Eyes nations, but that is another video for another day.

79
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,100
I want you to take particular note of the last two entries and how various memos and

80
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,940
cables have been written to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

81
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,740
If you remember an entry from Layer 2 of the Alien and UFOs of Skiur-Ottodies Iceberg,

82
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,460
you remember that Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is connected with the phenomena.

83
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,540
Wright-Patterson is often seen as a hub where crash retrievals of UFOs are stored.

84
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,300
Think of the Roswell case.

85
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,500
Allegedly, the crash materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

86
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,080
And think of Senator Barry Goldwater, who asked Wright-Patterson officials to see the

87
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,620
room where, quote, it was stored and was laughed off and told never to ask again.

88
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:44,100
Now if we fast forward to 1978 in New Zealand, Moondust investigates space fragments found

89
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,420
in New Zealand described as spherical or like a pressure vessel.

90
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,500
Note how this pressure vessel shape is very similar to Commander David Fraver's tic-tac

91
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,340
sighting, in which he describes the craft he observed as similar to a propane tank or

92
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,820
pressure vessel without any inlets or outlets.

93
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,500
And finally we arrive at my favorite case involving Project Moondust.

94
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,660
Everybody has heard about the Roswell crash.

95
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,820
Now not everybody knows most countries have their own sort of Roswell story in which some

96
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:28,860
sort of anomalous craft has hit the ground and some sort of retrieval is underway.

97
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,460
You can think of Canada's Shag Harbor for instance, maybe I'll make a video on Roswells

98
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:39,540
around the world if you're interested, but you may have never heard of the 1978 Bolivia

99
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,580
UFO crash.

100
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,380
This alleged retrieval was brought to my attention by the work of the UAP Caucus, a legislative

101
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,780
group on UAP initiative backed by members of Congress including Representative Timbershet,

102
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,540
Rep Anna Paulina Luna, Rep Eric Bertelsen, and Rep Jared Moskowitz.

103
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,540
The story famous in Bolivia goes.

104
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:11,420
On May 6, 1978 at 4.15pm, thousands of people near El Tayer Bolivia witnessed a cylindrical

105
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:18,500
object crash into the mountainside, creating a sonic boom that was heard up to 150 miles

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,500
away and cracked window panes as far as 30 miles in radius.

107
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,340
A local army corporal named Natalio Ruiz actually witnessed the UFO.

108
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,820
Sane flew above his head and resembled a gigantic wine container emitting a trace of white smoke.

109
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,100
Bolivian military and three jets were dispatched to check the wreckage.

110
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Upon discovering the wreckage, the local military and police were quoted as sane.

111
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,340
Our men have discovered the object and inspected it, but have received no further instruction

112
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,980
or further action.

113
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,540
It is a dull metallic cylinder, 12 feet long with a few dents.

114
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,780
No one knows what is inside it, and we are waiting the arrival of various technical commissions.

115
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,420
A NASA expert is also expected to arrive tomorrow morning.

116
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,940
And of course, two U.S. Army Air Force officers, Colonel Robert Simmons and Major Jesse Hayes,

117
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
arrived.

118
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,500
Subsequently, secret documents finally obtained through the Freedom of Information Act were

119
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,660
sent to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.

120
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,220
In this document, Vance writes that appropriate government agencies have been contacted regarding

121
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,180
this crash.

122
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,100
And I'm sure that you can guess the appropriate agency, Moondust.

123
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,660
Moondust received a film showing the object by the Bolivian military, and were tasked

124
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,500
with monitoring the situation.

125
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,620
Unfortunately, the trail of Moondust's involvement with this fascinating case ends here.

126
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,100
I don't know if they retrieved this craft or did nothing else.

127
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I don't know.

128
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,060
And it absolutely eats at me that I can't find out what happened.

129
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,620
Let's skip forward to 1992.

130
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,700
New Mexico Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici made inquiries to the Air Force about

131
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,900
Project Moondust.

132
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,780
In response, the Air Force said that there is no Project Moondust.

133
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,660
These missions have never existed.

134
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,460
The Senators responded with documents challenging this, and the Air Force revised its previous

135
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:34,620
statement acknowledging the existence and function of Moondust with regards to UFOs.

136
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:41,740
Then in 1994, Senator Domenici requested 11 documents pertaining to Moondust from the

137
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,660
Air Force.

138
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:51,220
The Air Force claimed that the projects no longer existed, nor do their files.

139
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,500
Classified reports that may have possibly existed were destroyed.

140
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,100
But this is categorically false.

141
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,340
Why would the Air Force state that documents had been destroyed when requested by a U.S.

142
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,780
Senator?

143
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,580
Why did the Air Force deny the existence of Project Moondust?

144
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,740
And why did they cling on to claiming that any record of the program was destroyed?

145
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,540
I've thought about this.

146
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,140
And do you remember in the Wilson Davis video, when Admiral Thomas Wilson claims that in

147
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,340
the early 90s, special access programs were reorganized to hide the crash retrieval and

148
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,820
reverse engineering programs within SAPOX, basically making them inaccessible to everybody?

149
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,620
When did these Senators ask for documents on Moondust, the mid-90s?

150
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,260
Were these documents destroyed and any sort of involvement denied by the Air Force occur

151
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,260
because of this reorganization and compartmentalization of programs?

152
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,380
I think so.

153
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,900
It's also important to note that in this time from 1969 to 2008, Project Blue Book to

154
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,860
OSAP, there was no official U.S. government UAP investigation group.

155
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,620
So this is what I'd like to consider the dark ages, the completely hidden era of UFO

156
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,340
investigation.

157
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:23,380
The Air Force clung on to denying the existence of Moondust.

158
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,860
And that is where our paper trail ends.

159
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:33,200
It's quite plausible that the Air Force destroyed the majority of files pertaining to Moondust.

160
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,480
In order to hide a crash retrieval program of UFOs.

161
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,200
My friends, thank you for joining me to take a look through Project Moondust.

162
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,120
I hope you learned something today.

163
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,720
I hope you learned that, you know, even though sometimes it may seem impossible to crack

164
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
what the United States government and defense industry and intelligence industry have been

165
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,360
up to in regards to UFOs, it is possible with enough digging.

166
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,160
I want to know in the comments what you guys think.

167
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,600
Do you think Moondust has historically been, or was at least at one point, responsible

168
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,720
for collecting UAP, or do you think it was just involved in collecting foreign and domestic

169
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,480
space vehicles because I do not?

170
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,040
I absolutely do not.

171
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:25,320
There's a couple other programs such as Zodiac, Blue Fly, the CIA's Office of Global Access,

172
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,840
and a couple more unacknowledged programs I'd like to cover in the future, so stay tuned

173
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
for that.

174
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,560
But please, if you don't mind, give a like and subscribe, it really helps the channel

175
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,320
and I am astounded at how this community has grown so far.

176
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,360
It's incredible to see people with the same passion for UFOs that I have kind of engaged

177
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,200
in the comments and watch these videos, so I gotta give you my deepest gratitude, because

178
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,280
I am forever thankful.

179
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,160
I will catch you guys for the next video, and thank you for tuning in, bye.
