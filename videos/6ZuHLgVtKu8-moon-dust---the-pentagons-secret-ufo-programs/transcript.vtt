WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
I thought it was totally nuts and I thought at first I was being deceived, it was a ruse.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.640
People started confiding in me, they approached me, I have plenty of current former senior

00:10.640 --> 00:15.240
intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career, that

00:15.240 --> 00:19.760
confided in me they were a part of a program, they named the program, I've never heard

00:19.760 --> 00:21.360
of it.

00:21.360 --> 00:28.440
Forget little green men, forget Area 51, forget Bob Lazar, and get any sort of conspiracy

00:28.440 --> 00:30.840
out of your mind for just a second.

00:30.840 --> 00:37.560
It's no longer just speculation or even a secret that within the US Department of Defense

00:37.560 --> 00:45.800
lies a shadowy UFO reverse engineering and crash retrieval program with access so exclusive,

00:45.800 --> 00:49.840
only a couple hundred people in the 80 plus year history of the program has ever been

00:49.840 --> 00:51.280
read in.

00:51.280 --> 00:57.920
People like David Grush and legislation like Schumer's 2024 NDAA legacy programs have

00:57.920 --> 01:03.100
helped turn a former conspiracy into an outrageous fact.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.360
Sometimes it feels like details, names, and operations of these programs will never come

01:07.360 --> 01:13.520
to life, that those in the know in the defense industry will cling to secrecy until they're

01:13.520 --> 01:15.840
dying breaths.

01:15.840 --> 01:22.160
Though actually receiving transparency may sometimes feel like a distant fever dream,

01:22.160 --> 01:26.200
you know your host UAP Gerb has you.

01:26.200 --> 01:32.960
Join me today and we will venture into Project Moondust and follow the astounding paper trail

01:32.960 --> 01:38.760
of one possible DOD UFO crash retrieval program.

01:38.760 --> 01:44.960
Edward J. Ruppelt conducted the first ever official US government study into the UFO phenomena

01:44.960 --> 01:49.680
under Project Grudge in 1948 to 1949.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.320
He went on to serve as the director of Project Sign and Blue Book, the subsequent US government

01:55.320 --> 02:00.240
official UFO investigation programs in the 20th century.

02:00.240 --> 02:07.280
During his time as director, Ruppelt concluded UFOs had a quote interplanetary explanation.

02:07.280 --> 02:14.840
On the 24th of April 1952, Ruppelt suggested programs parallel to the official USG investigation

02:14.840 --> 02:20.080
were quote, conducting a more complete investigation.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.960
This same conclusion was derived by J. Allen Heineck, the scientific advisor to Project

02:25.960 --> 02:27.080
Blue Book.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.200
We talked about him in the alien and UFOs obscure oddities iceberg layer two, so if you want

02:32.200 --> 02:34.640
to know more, read there.

02:34.640 --> 02:41.440
But Heineck additionally said that alongside Blue Book, there were other classified programs

02:41.440 --> 02:44.120
going on studying UFOs.

02:44.120 --> 02:49.960
One of these projects could have been an inconspicuous crash retrieval program, one

02:49.960 --> 02:56.360
that unless you look hard enough, you'll never know existed, and that of course is

02:56.360 --> 02:59.560
Project Moondust.

02:59.560 --> 03:06.560
The first mention of Moondust can be traced back to 1961 in a US Air Force document titled

03:07.200 --> 03:11.480
AFCIN-1E-0 Draft Policy.

03:11.480 --> 03:18.000
This proposal suggests that the USAF 1127th received collection responsibility duties

03:18.000 --> 03:26.280
for the USAF's established program for investigation of reliably reported unidentified flying objects

03:26.280 --> 03:28.800
within the United States.

03:28.800 --> 03:34.180
The memo also lists one project that has historically had this duty.

03:34.180 --> 03:40.260
That project is Moondust, which has the authority to locate, recover, and deliver descended

03:40.260 --> 03:43.020
foreign space vehicles.

03:43.020 --> 03:48.460
And as we can see in this 1967 review for the Assistant Chief of Staff for the Intelligence

03:48.460 --> 03:55.700
Community, which details the functions of the 1127th USAF Field Activities Group, Moondust

03:55.700 --> 04:02.700
is shown to not just be a proposal, but exists, and has historically dealt with some terrestrial

04:02.700 --> 04:04.340
space vehicles.

04:04.340 --> 04:12.060
In fact, in the 1967 year, Moondust captured a total of 49 fallen Soviet space objects

04:12.060 --> 04:15.660
and 17 US space objects.

04:15.660 --> 04:21.460
And this is followed by a large redacted portion of the memo.

04:21.460 --> 04:26.700
Now we know that Moondust had real collection responsibilities with Soviet American and

04:26.700 --> 04:29.020
redacted space vehicles.

04:29.020 --> 04:34.060
So let's start to take a look at some of Moondust's work.

04:34.060 --> 04:43.620
As early as 1961, Moondust was in fact investigating UFOs and acting on UFO reports.

04:43.620 --> 04:51.420
In this internal memo, in Pakistan, on April 25, 1961, Moondust recorded observations of

04:51.420 --> 05:00.260
three cigar-shaped UFOs flying in a close delta formation above Karachi, Pakistan.

05:00.260 --> 05:04.980
But Moondust wasn't just investigating UFO reports.

05:04.980 --> 05:09.260
In fact, it was actively engaged in UFO collection.

05:09.260 --> 05:12.760
Let's travel to 1968 in Nepal.

05:12.760 --> 05:19.500
In this memo, the Defense Intelligence Department monitors a crashed circular metal disc discovered

05:19.500 --> 05:21.260
in Nepal.

05:21.260 --> 05:28.500
Four months after, the State Department cable titled Moondust, right to the DIA, 1127th,

05:28.500 --> 05:34.180
and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base that a diplomatic visit to Kathmandu, Nepal, was

05:34.180 --> 05:39.580
a, quote, fishing expedition for info on space objects.

05:39.580 --> 05:46.620
Additional cables show Royal Nepali Army showed photos of these space objects to US offices.

05:46.620 --> 05:52.180
A possible cover story was then constructed here of a crashed satellite, despite NORAD

05:52.180 --> 05:58.740
and NASA data showing a 100% successful satellite launch rate in 1968.

05:58.740 --> 06:04.800
Unfortunately the trail stops here, so I cannot tell you if this circular metal disc was actually

06:04.800 --> 06:07.780
recovered by US entities.

06:07.780 --> 06:11.900
Now let's fast forward a little bit to the 1970s.

06:11.900 --> 06:19.260
In Canada in 1976, a memo achieved via the Freedom of Information Act shows that Moondust

06:19.260 --> 06:24.820
wrote to Canadian officials requesting photos of space-related metals originating from

06:24.820 --> 06:29.480
a non-US, quote, satellite.

06:29.480 --> 06:35.540
That would be of particular interest to USF foreign technology divisions at Wright-Patterson

06:35.540 --> 06:40.180
Air Force Base and to the CIA's Office of Weapon Intelligence.

06:40.180 --> 06:45.720
Now Canada has historically been very open on investigating UFOs and participating in

06:45.720 --> 06:51.380
UFO analysis with other Five Eyes nations, but that is another video for another day.

06:51.380 --> 06:57.100
I want you to take particular note of the last two entries and how various memos and

06:57.100 --> 07:00.940
cables have been written to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

07:00.940 --> 07:07.740
If you remember an entry from Layer 2 of the Alien and UFOs of Skiur-Ottodies Iceberg,

07:07.740 --> 07:12.460
you remember that Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is connected with the phenomena.

07:12.460 --> 07:18.540
Wright-Patterson is often seen as a hub where crash retrievals of UFOs are stored.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.300
Think of the Roswell case.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.500
Allegedly, the crash materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

07:25.500 --> 07:30.080
And think of Senator Barry Goldwater, who asked Wright-Patterson officials to see the

07:30.080 --> 07:36.620
room where, quote, it was stored and was laughed off and told never to ask again.

07:36.620 --> 07:44.100
Now if we fast forward to 1978 in New Zealand, Moondust investigates space fragments found

07:44.100 --> 07:50.420
in New Zealand described as spherical or like a pressure vessel.

07:50.420 --> 07:55.500
Note how this pressure vessel shape is very similar to Commander David Fraver's tic-tac

07:55.500 --> 08:01.340
sighting, in which he describes the craft he observed as similar to a propane tank or

08:01.340 --> 08:05.820
pressure vessel without any inlets or outlets.

08:05.820 --> 08:12.500
And finally we arrive at my favorite case involving Project Moondust.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.660
Everybody has heard about the Roswell crash.

08:15.660 --> 08:21.820
Now not everybody knows most countries have their own sort of Roswell story in which some

08:21.820 --> 08:28.860
sort of anomalous craft has hit the ground and some sort of retrieval is underway.

08:28.860 --> 08:33.460
You can think of Canada's Shag Harbor for instance, maybe I'll make a video on Roswells

08:33.460 --> 08:39.540
around the world if you're interested, but you may have never heard of the 1978 Bolivia

08:39.540 --> 08:41.580
UFO crash.

08:41.580 --> 08:47.380
This alleged retrieval was brought to my attention by the work of the UAP Caucus, a legislative

08:47.380 --> 08:53.780
group on UAP initiative backed by members of Congress including Representative Timbershet,

08:53.780 --> 08:59.540
Rep Anna Paulina Luna, Rep Eric Bertelsen, and Rep Jared Moskowitz.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.540
The story famous in Bolivia goes.

09:02.540 --> 09:11.420
On May 6, 1978 at 4.15pm, thousands of people near El Tayer Bolivia witnessed a cylindrical

09:11.420 --> 09:18.500
object crash into the mountainside, creating a sonic boom that was heard up to 150 miles

09:18.500 --> 09:24.500
away and cracked window panes as far as 30 miles in radius.

09:24.500 --> 09:29.340
A local army corporal named Natalio Ruiz actually witnessed the UFO.

09:29.340 --> 09:35.820
Sane flew above his head and resembled a gigantic wine container emitting a trace of white smoke.

09:35.820 --> 09:40.100
Bolivian military and three jets were dispatched to check the wreckage.

09:40.100 --> 09:45.100
Upon discovering the wreckage, the local military and police were quoted as sane.

09:45.100 --> 09:50.340
Our men have discovered the object and inspected it, but have received no further instruction

09:50.340 --> 09:51.980
or further action.

09:51.980 --> 09:56.540
It is a dull metallic cylinder, 12 feet long with a few dents.

09:56.540 --> 10:02.780
No one knows what is inside it, and we are waiting the arrival of various technical commissions.

10:02.780 --> 10:07.420
A NASA expert is also expected to arrive tomorrow morning.

10:07.420 --> 10:13.940
And of course, two U.S. Army Air Force officers, Colonel Robert Simmons and Major Jesse Hayes,

10:13.940 --> 10:14.940
arrived.

10:14.940 --> 10:20.500
Subsequently, secret documents finally obtained through the Freedom of Information Act were

10:20.500 --> 10:24.660
sent to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.

10:24.660 --> 10:30.220
In this document, Vance writes that appropriate government agencies have been contacted regarding

10:30.220 --> 10:32.180
this crash.

10:32.180 --> 10:38.100
And I'm sure that you can guess the appropriate agency, Moondust.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.660
Moondust received a film showing the object by the Bolivian military, and were tasked

10:42.660 --> 10:45.500
with monitoring the situation.

10:45.500 --> 10:51.620
Unfortunately, the trail of Moondust's involvement with this fascinating case ends here.

10:51.620 --> 10:57.100
I don't know if they retrieved this craft or did nothing else.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.100
I don't know.

10:58.100 --> 11:02.060
And it absolutely eats at me that I can't find out what happened.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.620
Let's skip forward to 1992.

11:04.620 --> 11:11.700
New Mexico Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici made inquiries to the Air Force about

11:11.700 --> 11:13.900
Project Moondust.

11:13.900 --> 11:19.780
In response, the Air Force said that there is no Project Moondust.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.660
These missions have never existed.

11:22.660 --> 11:28.460
The Senators responded with documents challenging this, and the Air Force revised its previous

11:28.460 --> 11:34.620
statement acknowledging the existence and function of Moondust with regards to UFOs.

11:34.620 --> 11:41.740
Then in 1994, Senator Domenici requested 11 documents pertaining to Moondust from the

11:41.740 --> 11:43.660
Air Force.

11:43.660 --> 11:51.220
The Air Force claimed that the projects no longer existed, nor do their files.

11:51.220 --> 11:56.500
Classified reports that may have possibly existed were destroyed.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.100
But this is categorically false.

11:59.100 --> 12:04.340
Why would the Air Force state that documents had been destroyed when requested by a U.S.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.780
Senator?

12:05.780 --> 12:11.580
Why did the Air Force deny the existence of Project Moondust?

12:11.580 --> 12:17.740
And why did they cling on to claiming that any record of the program was destroyed?

12:17.740 --> 12:20.540
I've thought about this.

12:20.540 --> 12:25.140
And do you remember in the Wilson Davis video, when Admiral Thomas Wilson claims that in

12:25.140 --> 12:32.340
the early 90s, special access programs were reorganized to hide the crash retrieval and

12:32.340 --> 12:38.820
reverse engineering programs within SAPOX, basically making them inaccessible to everybody?

12:38.820 --> 12:44.620
When did these Senators ask for documents on Moondust, the mid-90s?

12:44.620 --> 12:50.260
Were these documents destroyed and any sort of involvement denied by the Air Force occur

12:50.260 --> 12:55.260
because of this reorganization and compartmentalization of programs?

12:55.260 --> 12:57.380
I think so.

12:57.380 --> 13:03.900
It's also important to note that in this time from 1969 to 2008, Project Blue Book to

13:03.900 --> 13:09.860
OSAP, there was no official U.S. government UAP investigation group.

13:09.860 --> 13:15.620
So this is what I'd like to consider the dark ages, the completely hidden era of UFO

13:15.620 --> 13:17.340
investigation.

13:17.340 --> 13:23.380
The Air Force clung on to denying the existence of Moondust.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.860
And that is where our paper trail ends.

13:25.860 --> 13:33.200
It's quite plausible that the Air Force destroyed the majority of files pertaining to Moondust.

13:33.200 --> 13:38.480
In order to hide a crash retrieval program of UFOs.

13:38.480 --> 13:43.200
My friends, thank you for joining me to take a look through Project Moondust.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.120
I hope you learned something today.

13:45.120 --> 13:50.720
I hope you learned that, you know, even though sometimes it may seem impossible to crack

13:50.720 --> 13:54.560
what the United States government and defense industry and intelligence industry have been

13:54.560 --> 13:59.360
up to in regards to UFOs, it is possible with enough digging.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.160
I want to know in the comments what you guys think.

14:01.160 --> 14:06.600
Do you think Moondust has historically been, or was at least at one point, responsible

14:06.600 --> 14:13.720
for collecting UAP, or do you think it was just involved in collecting foreign and domestic

14:13.720 --> 14:16.480
space vehicles because I do not?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.040
I absolutely do not.

14:18.040 --> 14:25.320
There's a couple other programs such as Zodiac, Blue Fly, the CIA's Office of Global Access,

14:25.320 --> 14:29.840
and a couple more unacknowledged programs I'd like to cover in the future, so stay tuned

14:29.840 --> 14:30.840
for that.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.560
But please, if you don't mind, give a like and subscribe, it really helps the channel

14:34.560 --> 14:38.320
and I am astounded at how this community has grown so far.

14:38.320 --> 14:43.360
It's incredible to see people with the same passion for UFOs that I have kind of engaged

14:43.360 --> 14:49.200
in the comments and watch these videos, so I gotta give you my deepest gratitude, because

14:49.200 --> 14:51.280
I am forever thankful.

14:51.280 --> 14:55.160
I will catch you guys for the next video, and thank you for tuning in, bye.
