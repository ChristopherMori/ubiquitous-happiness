1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
So here is your list. I'm not going to go through 145 sites. Some of them are black

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,880
sites. Some of them are bases, you know, about like Wright Patterson, Edwards, Nellis, Area 51,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,680
so-called. But all of them are based on witness testimony and intelligence we've gathered over

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,000
the last 30 years and it's time for it to be disclosed. Recently in 2024, Stephen Greer in

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,040
the Disclosure Project released their entire catalog of documents, communication logs,

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,160
drawings, and other files. Love them or hate them, over the years, Greer has provided valuable

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,480
witnesses a platform to speak and wrote in my opinion a truly fantastic piece of work,

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,280
his 2001 Disclosure Briefing document. So while I have my problems with Greer,

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,040
this document archive absolutely commands my attention. Greer's list of UFO whistleblowers

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,720
and witnesses features over 700 names, many of which are redacted. Here we find names we all

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,880
expect. Michael Herrera, the late Dr. Robert Wood, Richard Doty, Robert Salas, Jonathan Wagan,

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,200
even Bob Lazar. But we also find 22 pages of redacted names. Some of these names are described

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,080
simply as points of contact to others, but some have descriptions that might be well worth our

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,000
attention. Viewers of my channel may remember UFO witnesses redacted list in which I derived the

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,120
names and contacted two of these witnesses from poorly redacted documents uploaded by Greer.

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,640
One such witness MS agreed to interview on UFO testing occurring at Dugway Proving Grounds while

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,240
the other witness TB was much more shadowy. Today we cover the redacted entry that has

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,920
captivated my attention and commanded my research for months on end. A witness I have been more than

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,200
eager to cover as I believe this witness's alleged first-hand experiences with UFO reverse

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,240
engineering offer crucial insights into DOD and defense contractor involvement with UFO programs.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,600
Hey guys it's UAP Gerb and thank you so much for joining me today. I am beyond excited to cover

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,320
another witness in Steven Greer's redacted list. Witness 11063 who makes claims of testing UAP

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,920
reverse engineer technology and craft at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Grab your pencils and

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,200
notebooks because we have a tremendous amount of research to conduct and avenues to explore from

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,800
two simple documents on this former wing commander at Edwards. And before we get started guys full

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,680
disclaimer I have been able to ascertain this individual's identity and have tried to contact

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,200
him through myriad methods. Should he ever respond and be willing to go public I will go to any lengths

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,640
to speak with him. But for operational security and his family's safety I will not burn witness

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,400
11063's identity. I have also attempted to encourage this individual to testify before

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,520
Congress or contact the Senate Intelligence Committee. For this project I will only be using

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,120
publicly available sources no classified or hidden information will be disclosed in this video.

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,240
And I would like to say I have thoroughly vetted this individual through public online resources

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,040
and can confirm his Air Force station at Nellis Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and the

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Pentagon as well as various positions within the U.S. Air Force as stated by Greer.

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:20,960
I first took note of witness 11063 who I will further refer to as Ed when Dr. Greer released

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,760
his witness list. This astonishing entry reads quote career Air Force Nellis Edwards test director

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,840
of electronics warfare group tested reverse engineer technology was at the Pentagon DOE

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Wing commander at Edwards contacted us in 2023 end quote unlike MSTB and myriad other witnesses no

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,840
communications or files existed on Ed at the initial release of the DPI archive files.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
It wasn't until late summer of 2024 the disclosure project intelligence archive

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
updated an additional section of documents intelligence briefing modules that we would

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,680
get our first leads on Ed within this section we find module three under UFO crash retrievals

43
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,200
titled quote covert government retrieval and handling ET vehicles end quote analyzing the

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,480
executive summary we find some fascinating information adapted from a March 2024 oral

45
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,120
presentation from Greer not only does Greer discuss 130 plus instances of NHI objects being

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,160
downed and retrieved involving major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Skunkworks

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,320
and Boeing but these operations are conducted using advanced electrocovidic technologies

48
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,480
and electromagnetic pulse EMP weapons I do highly recommend reading through the entirety of this

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,840
module as it invokes the quality of the 2001 disclosure briefing document and also makes

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,400
mention of witness MS and Richard Focch a formal naval research lab senior scientist who discussed

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,760
large silent triangular alien reproduction vehicles over remote areas of dugway proving grounds

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,960
towards the end of module three we see our first discussion of Ed outside the witness list quote

53
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,240
a lieutenant colonel who managed pilots at Edwards Air Force Base and is responsible for training

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,400
pilots who operated man-made UFOs has expressed his willingness to share his information openly

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
Dr. Greer introduced him to the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee

56
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,160
where he shared information he is also eager to testify openly before the House Oversight Committee

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,280
though responses from key members like reps Luna and Bershet have not yet been received

58
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,560
having left the Air Force in 2009 the Lieutenant Colonel was extensively briefed on operations

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,400
not just at Edwards but also at Nellison area 51 he believes that since the operations he was

60
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,080
involved in were illegal he is free to discuss them publicly and is ready to disclose everything

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,160
he knows in an open hearing under oath end quote it was around the time of the upload of this module

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Greer finally uploaded two documents under witness 11063

63
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,040
first let's analyze what I would consider to be the less impactful of the two documents on Ed

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,960
to understand his background and motives for contacting Greer in late 2023 in presumably an

65
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,920
internal disclosure project email an unknown individual emailed Greer stating witness Ed

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,720
had been following Greer's work for some time and wish to answer Greer's call for whistleblowers

67
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,240
this dpi employee states Ed served in USAF from 1999 to his early retirement in 2015

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,760
where he ended his career according to the email Ed additionally came from an engineering background

69
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,640
worked with the Department of Energy and served at the Pentagon for seven years the email accurately

70
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,360
breaks down Ed's service record three years at Nellis Air Force Base Nevada three years at

71
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,840
Hanscom Air Force Base Massachusetts and five years at Edwards Air Force Base California in 2006

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,760
Ed was sent to Edwards AFB for the bases test pilot school it was here Ed would claim pilots at the

73
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,440
Air Force Base are trained for unacknowledged special access programs using reverse engineered

74
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,840
non-human technology side note Edwards is well known for its prolific and prestigious test pilot

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,600
this highly selective program trains pilots navigators and engineers on experimental flight

76
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,360
platforms originating from the Air Force material commands 412th test wing the test pilot school's

77
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,200
mission is to quote conduct full spectrum tests and evaluations of aerospace weapons and to be

78
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,320
the world's premier educational and training center for theoretical and applied flight test

79
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,440
engineering end quote an additional point the test pilot school originated out of Wright Patterson

80
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,880
Air Force Base during World War two during his time at Edwards after graduating the USAF's highly

81
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,160
selective test pilot school Ed would serve as the head of an electronic warfare group that tested

82
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,080
NHI reverse engineered technology in this role Ed claimed to serve as the intermediary between

83
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,440
engineers who had direct reporting to him and test pilots when quote they had a manned craft they

84
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,960
were testing end quote interesting to point out here according to the email Ed agrees with Dr.

85
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,800
Greer stance on free energy systems from direct firsthand involvement in various projects a little

86
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,920
bit of context here since the late 90s early 2000s Greer has highlighted issues of suppressed

87
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,040
technologies and systems levied from the reverse engineering of off world technologies these

88
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,440
technologies are famously referred to as zero point energy systems to quote the 2001 disclosure

89
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,240
document quote we have identified insiders and scientists who can prove in open congressional

90
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,920
hearings that we do in fact possess classified energy generation and anti-gravity propulsion

91
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,200
systems capable of completely and permanently replacing all forms of current used energy

92
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,040
generation and transport systems these devices access the ambient electromagnetic and so called

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,320
zero point energy state to produce vast amounts of energy without any pollution such systems

94
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,080
essentially generate energy by tapping into the ever present quantum vacuum energy state the baseline

95
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,520
energy from which all energy and matter is fluxing all matter and energy is supported by this baseline

96
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,320
energy state and it can be tapped through unique electromagnetic circuits and configurations

97
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,440
to generate huge amounts of energy from space time all around us these are not perpetual

98
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,480
motion machines nor do they violate the laws of thermodynamics they merely tap an ambient energy

99
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,840
field all around us to generate energy end quote zero point and free energy systems are not the

100
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,960
topic of today's video so i recommend reading the hunt for zero point by author nick cook jesse

101
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,560
michael's video aerospace secret search for anti-gravity or even greer's 2023 documentary the

102
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,280
lost century and how to reclaim it and it is interesting and worth noting that this internal

103
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,360
disclosure project email states ed is in complete agreement with greer stance on free energy ed isn't

104
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,840
the only witness to comment on zero point systems either take redacted entry 10 747 for example who

105
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,000
is stated to be an x chairman and vp of a well-known corporation i have high conviction this company

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,560
is general electric according to greer 10 747 has quote huge details and testimony regarding free

107
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,320
energy and the military industrial complex cover-up slash suppression of these technologies

108
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,240
no several people killed and scared to death end quote towards the end of our witness testimony

109
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,440
internal email mention is made ed had been tracking current legislation relating to legacy program

110
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,040
member amnesty and would be willing to testify to aero as long as kirk patrick was removed from

111
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,760
the organization because according to ed the good doctor quote is an insider and is meant to squash

112
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,760
information end quote this is indeed a very charged statement and one i am sure many ufo

113
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,160
investigators will agree with based off the actions of sean kirk patrick and the way you combat conspiracy

114
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,400
theories and and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact and science and truth

115
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:04,320
so if you've got evidence for conspiracy then then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth

116
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,600
is there has been none that has been substantiated for this and everything that has been brought to

117
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,040
our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when i was in that position as the

118
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,320
director we investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from

119
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,680
most everything was explainable through other documentation other programs other people that

120
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,520
had talked to other people it goes without saying dr k has very little goodwill with the public

121
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,040
like the lies and half-hearted debunks in the aero historical report volume one or aero's 2022

122
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,440
contracts with sandcorp a company built to plug whistleblower leaks i have even made an entire video

123
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,160
on sean kirk patrick and his disinformation which is at this point somewhat outdated as it covered

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,960
little of kirk patrick's role as an unpaid consultant after leaving aero so let's briefly

125
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,080
cover a new revelation that supports ed's accusations of the doctor injecting misinformation

126
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,480
into the public well in a recent us space command foyer release by twitter user tag underscore om

127
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,240
we can find a january 2023 meeting scheduled by dr kirk patrick involving us space com and

128
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,560
senior us joint command staff the purpose of this meeting was quote uap response and recovery and

129
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,400
material transfer end quote the witness testimony document gives us a brief overview of ed his

130
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,200
background and motives but our next document is where our true research can begin

131
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:43,440
this two-page set of notes roughly covers a phone conversation between dr grier and ed on

132
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,480
november 25th 2023 not only do these notes describe ed's testimony in depth but also break down his

133
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,280
military career by year and station the document is absolutely worth going through line by line

134
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,560
off the bat ed asks rear if he has threatened legal action against lockheed and bowing as ed

135
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,040
was read into programs overlapping these two companies at the beginning of his air force

136
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,800
career ed did indeed work with lockheed as a range technical contractor in the early 2000s at nellis

137
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,080
air force base along with some other smaller specialized contractors however there is no

138
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,360
mention of bowing to the best of my knowledge in his work history publicly we can find myriad

139
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
projects and current job openings for work between lockheed and nellis air force base but there are

140
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,120
a few of extreme interest here check out this lockheed martin case study titled the importance

141
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,600
of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in which the contractor was tasked with updating

142
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,640
the system used by usaf warfare center for intelligence collection and processing lockheed

143
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,000
martin reconfigured a two-phase security classification system used by the national geospatial

144
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,680
intelligence system yes the same agency grush was a part of when liaison to the uap task force

145
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,880
and the same agency recently mentioned by respected journalist chris sharp as participating in

146
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,200
undersea uap crash retrievals the system was implemented to combined air and space operation

147
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,320
center at nellis air force base which is tasked with processing information for exploitation of

148
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,920
time sensitive targets i can't help but speculate here although this lockheed project arose from

149
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,080
challenges in the nellis red flag advanced aerial combat training exercise could such systems be used

150
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,360
to monitor uap and uap crash retrievals the idea ed was read into uap programs at nellis air force

151
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,360
base as a first lieutenant from 1999 to 2002 can possibly be reinforced later in the notes where

152
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,480
greer states ed was briefed at area 51 s4 where quote a major said they had caught slash captured

153
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,920
lots of aircraft end quote this small point will later become even more interesting as we learn

154
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,200
the area 51 groom lake facility is administered by a detachment from edwards air force base

155
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,040
california the base where ed would transfer to and conduct the bulk of his first hand work around

156
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,520
uap programs ed states this briefing was conducted via a 30 minute video which showed inspection

157
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:12,240
aircraft that were essentially invisible inspection craft what exactly does this mean is ed referring

158
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,600
to crash retrievals or possibly alien reproduction vehicles arvs for inspection use only this reminds

159
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,280
me closely of the story of mark mcandellish whose close friend brad sorenson allegedly saw three

160
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,840
arvs titled flux liners that were available for cleared personnel to inspect with paneling removed

161
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,280
to highlight hardware of the craft the linings craft were essentially invisible further supports

162
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,880
this thesis as i have covered firsthand witnesses before that have discussed arv craft with cloaking

163
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,480
mechanisms craft that look identical to the flux liner highlighted by mcandellish and an

164
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,280
interesting detail according to sorenson and mcandellish these arvs were shown at norton air

165
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,880
force base a mere 80 miles from edwards air force base if you're unfamiliar with the testimony of

166
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,080
mark mcandellish have no fear i will cover it soon as i believe it is one of the most impactful

167
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,680
testimonies in all of ufology greer goes on to state that at nellis air force base nevada

168
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,320
ed worked at building 200 under the redacted name of the first commander of the 98th range wing now

169
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,920
let's break this down the 98th range wing now called the nevada test and training range began

170
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,760
operations in 2001 and serves as the primary military training area for the nellis air force

171
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,160
base complex to quote usaf the nttr is the largest contiguous air and ground space available for

172
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,120
peacetime military operations in the free world the range occupies 2.9 million acres of land 5000

173
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,160
square miles of airspace which is restricted from civilian air traffic overflight and quote

174
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,760
the nevada test and training range nttr provides the warfighter of flexible realistic and multi

175
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,640
dimensional battle space to conduct testing tactics development and advanced training and

176
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,160
support of us national interests while also conducting department of energy testing research

177
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,840
and development quote the nttr coordinates operational and support matters with major

178
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,680
commands other services do e and department of interior as well as other federal state and

179
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,160
local government agencies the nttr acts as the single point of contact for range customers and

180
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,080
quote analyzing the nttr and its mission to create operate and maintain live and synthetic

181
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,600
environments and integrate partners to optimize warfighter capabilities this location sounds

182
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,920
like an ideal choice for do d and usg elements alongside contractors to test reverse engineer

183
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:45,040
technology to top it off the nttr south range contains groom lake area 51 a location deeply

184
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,840
entwined with ufology his time at building 200 at the nttr may have seen ed interact with boeing

185
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,680
lachid martin alongside the doe which i mentioned i could find no record of in his resume circling

186
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,800
back to the call notes greer made specific note to ed serving under the first commander right around

187
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:10,080
2001 of the 98th range wing or nttr i have tried at length and failed to find the original commander

188
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,760
of the 98th but i would like to take a long hard look at the commander from 2005 to 2007

189
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,760
colonel christopher haves i find this analysis necessary as ed may have implied the 98th commander

190
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,600
has oversight to uap reverse engineering programs colonel haves spent 26 years in the air force

191
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,560
linked to key roles in fighter aviation his post service resume is of heavy interest here

192
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,840
following the air force and its service in the 98th range wing haves directed global trade

193
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,440
controls at boeing in washington dc handling trade policy and technology licensing within

194
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,960
major government departments haves additionally led a team at raytheon technologies another defense

195
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,200
contractor implicated with uap study here the colonel managed relationships with key usg officials

196
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,160
such as the office of the secretary of defense and other military departments aligning raytheon

197
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,600
strategies within government objectives the colonel also served as a special advisor on national

198
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,800
security affairs to then vice president dick cheney who has seen swirls of rumors recently

199
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,320
implicating cheney as a senior member of ufo programs where have offered insights on foreign

200
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,760
defense capabilities haves resume as well as his role as commander of the 98th range wing

201
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,600
offers us a glimpse at a possible reverse engineering program official and speaking of the nttr in

202
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,920
greer's notes we can find a simple sentence quote ed saw man-made craft on the range was there quite

203
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,280
a bit end quote with strong conviction we can assume the range in question here is the nttr

204
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,200
from this statement we can also gauge that ed is claiming area 51 slash s4 and or nellis

205
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,280
air force base has successful man-made reverse engineered craft greer then comments on ed being

206
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,120
sent to edwards air force base in california in 2006 for range orientation where ed would go on to

207
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,880
serve as director of redacted for an electronic warfare group referencing the witness testimony

208
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,680
document we can assume this director role was a test director for a technology reverse engineering

209
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,640
group we can also assume from witness testimony this station followed ed's service in edwards

210
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,080
test pilot school what bolsters these claims from ed is the fact edwards electronic warfare group

211
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,800
stems from the 412th test wing the exact same wing that houses the edwards usaf test pilot school

212
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,720
if ed's testimony is true the 412th test wing out of edwards directly deals with the testing of

213
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,040
reverse engineered craft and technology of non-human origin this would also mean the 412th

214
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,320
reverse engineering program works in conjunction with the nevada test in training range this is

215
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,400
one of the biggest takeaways of this entire research project if his testimony is true ed was

216
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,080
briefed on uap programs at s4 while stationed at nellis where he was then sent to the 412th

217
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,160
test pilot school and test wing to further this work in an air force legacy ufo program as a test

218
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,200
director the document state ed served at nellis until 2002 and was then sent to edwards in 2006

219
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,000
where was ed during this gap this period of time 2002 to 2005 saw ed stationed at handscom

220
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,680
air force based near boston massachusetts greer writes that ed worked with the massachusetts

221
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,360
institute of technology while at handscom working on foreign military assets but only saw terrestrial

222
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,040
this mention of mit is still of great interest to us i've talked before about the involvement of

223
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,520
ua rc or university affiliated research centers with uap programs many times most recently with

224
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,280
dr eric a walker head of penn states ua rc the applied research laboratory who admitted he was

225
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,520
involved in the keksburg ufo crash incident while mit has their own ua rc operating under the us

226
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,400
army as well the institute for soldier nano technologies whose goal is to quote discover

227
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,240
and feel technologies that dramatically improve the protection survivability and mission capabilities

228
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,360
of the warfighter and of warfighter supporting platforms and systems and quote the only mention

229
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,000
i can find of relation between handscom and uap is an anonymous letter sent to Leonard

230
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,400
stringfield dated march 14th 1975 which claimed to recount the testimony of one colonel sims a

231
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,080
pseudonym according to the letter both handscom and mit are two of the military bases and research

232
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,040
laboratories that perform ufo operations alongside edwards right paterson carswell los alamos sandia

233
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,520
etc okay so ed served at edwards from 2006 to 2010 where he was allegedly formally read into

234
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,960
multiple quote unquote advanced aircraft programs at edwards the use of the word formal here is

235
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,200
quite interesting almost like ed's time at nellis saw him getting bits and pieces of program

236
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,400
information while his role as test director saw a complete briefing this echoes numerous claims

237
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,200
that uap reverse engineering programs are as if not more compartmentalized than the manhattan

238
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,360
atomic bomb project greer writes in 2008 when director of a redacted program ed was part of a

239
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,080
go public plan via the air force the plan was called off in 2009 to 2010 and saw ed move to the

240
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,760
pentagon the killing of the program was done by a two star general now i have found no confirming

241
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,440
evidence of this so-called go public plan but i have found a series of use of two star generals aka

242
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,160
major generals that either retired as major generals or were at the time period of interest

243
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,840
that may give us an answer one prime suspect is major general thomas k anderson who reached

244
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,080
the rank of major general in 2009 and retired in 2013 anderson's senior role oversaw him

245
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,920
serving as commander of the curtis e lemay center for doctrine development and education

246
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,480
to quote the air force quote the center is responsible for the research development and

247
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,000
production of air force doctrine and input for joint and multinational doctrine development

248
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,240
activities and quote general anderson oversaw numerous key positions within do d such as the

249
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,520
air staff joint staff combat command staffs nato and chief of staff and director of intelligence

250
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,520
for us strategic command let us also inspect major general u jean haas who served as brigadier

251
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,400
general during our window 2009 to 2010 before being promoted to major general in 2012 haas served as

252
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,160
vice commander air force special operations command from 2009 to 2011 haas additionally

253
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,320
acted as director for force structure requirements resources and strategic assessment as a j8 haas

254
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,800
commanded my interest due to his extremely prestigious role within do d and station at

255
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,800
two air force bases allegedly connected to uap programs mac dill air force base and fort belvois

256
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,920
virginia moving on i would like to look at major general kcd blake who earned his major

257
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,760
general ship in 2015 and served as a colonel during ed's alleged disclosure plan not only

258
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,720
did general blake work as commander to air force installations contracting agency of assistant

259
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,840
secretary of the air force for acquisition at right paterson air force base ohio but his most

260
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,280
senior position saw blake as the deputy assistant secretary for contracting under the office of

261
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,440
the assistant secretary for air force for acquisition in washington dc here he was responsible for quote

262
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,560
all aspects of contracting relating to the acquisition of weapon systems logistics and

263
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:23,920
operational support for the air force end quote overseeing support of 826 billion dollars annually

264
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,880
although blake may have been a colonel during this plan he piqued my interest as during 2008 he

265
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,000
served as director program acquisitions defense procurement and acquisition policy in the office

266
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,440
of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics for the pentagon there

267
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,880
are a total of four other major generals of interest here including c donald allston h brent

268
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,320
blake senior randy ap but i want to lastly focus on major general christopher p asano asano did not

269
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,560
earn his major general ship until 2019 meaning during 2009 to 2010 he is the least likely

270
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,600
candidate to have decision-making power over a disclosure campaign however his early career

271
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,920
dovetails almost identically with that of ed and is worth mentioning in the year 2000 asano attended

272
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,360
usav test pilot school at you guessed it edwards in the early 2010s the general would command the

273
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,800
412th operations group at edwards before serving as the commander of the air force test center at

274
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,440
edwards at his senior station asano oversaw a 31 billion dollar enterprise comprised of more than

275
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:35,200
19 000 military civilian and contractor personnel across edwards aigland and arnold afb's greer

276
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
makes special note to right paterson air force base the infamous location we have discussed in

277
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,000
almost every single video i have ever done according to ed right paterson has a tight

278
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,920
connection with edwards ed even makes an educated guess right pat's hangar six specifically held

279
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,760
by a logics according to internal right pat documents hangar six was initially quote primarily

280
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,880
used by the signal corps for installing radios and antennas and after the war it became a facility

281
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,080
for retrofitting and modifying planes and quote the hangar featured several smaller doors instead

282
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,520
of a giant hangar door which would later be used as the right field fitness center however the fitness

283
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,080
center is located in hangar 22 not hangar six at right pat besides blueprints and images of the

284
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,560
exterior i can find almost zero internal images reports or articles in general on hangar six

285
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,000
this facility will be a priority of my research moving forward especially analyzing for infrastructure

286
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,640
to support living and or deceased biologics as ed has claimed from 2010 to 2015 following the failed

287
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,200
coming forward plan ed moved to the pentagon where according to greer he operated within research

288
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,000
and development panel chain little was discussed between greer and ed on his responsibilities

289
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,920
at the pentagon however one interesting note is recorded quote 34 billion dollars than 40 billion

290
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,880
dollars to non air force authorization non blue toa and quote toa meaning transfer of authority

291
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,040
this statement seemingly confirms statements made over the decades by numerous whistleblowers

292
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,360
discussing uap programs being funded through usap off book black operations i will draw your attention

293
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,240
to december 11th 2017 where former assistant secretary of housing and urban development

294
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,920
kathryn austin fits published a paper titled black budget of the united states here she discussed

295
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,640
21 trillion dollars found in unauthorized spending in the department of defense and

296
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,200
housing and urban development centers between 1998 and 2015 soon after publication the dod

297
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,680
announced its first ever department wide independent audit fits personally believed

298
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,360
some unauthorized funding was utilized for domestic clandestine military rnd some of

299
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,240
legal uap programs from dod

300
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,640
the primary testimony of ed involves first-hand work on uap programs focused on the testing

301
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,560
of reverse engineered non-human technology at nellis air force base slash area 51 s4

302
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,160
and the 412th test group out of edwards air force base california as we have discussed before

303
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,440
numerous factors including ed being briefed at s4 and then sent to the 412th for test pilot

304
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,640
school before becoming director of the electronic warfare group where he acted as the intermediary

305
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,080
between engineers and test pilots when the group had manned craft to test we can conclude with

306
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,680
high confidence ed's work revolved primarily around the utilization of nhi tech to construct

307
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:35,280
and test arv or alien reproduction vehicles area 51 s4 has been discussed in ufology for decades

308
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,480
and is often immediately associated with the claims of bop lasar but what about edwards

309
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,520
are there any other stories of uap programs at the californian base that can support or detract

310
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,680
from ed's claims well for starters we can go all the way back to 1957 to the testimony of mercury

311
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,560
astronaut gordon cooper cooper claimed while stationed as a project manager at edwards air

312
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,200
force base a group of photographers assigned to photograph remote positions of the base

313
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,480
observed a large strange-looking craft above a lake bed cooper's crew began taking films of

314
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,360
the craft and according to cooper the craft was quote hovering above the ground and then it slowly

315
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,480
came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes end quote the camera crew estimated the

316
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,000
object to be about 30 feet in diameter shiny silver in color and featured three landing gear

317
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,120
the crew got within 20 yards of the craft before it departed cooper did in fact see the film but

318
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,160
stated the evidence was confiscated and this is a very brief summary of the story as i would love

319
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,640
to cover it further in great detail well that was i was found i was having some camera men found the

320
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,360
installation of a of a precision landing facility we were putting in right on the edge of the dry

321
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,600
lake and the saucer flew right over them and put down three little gear and landed out on the dry

322
00:30:51,600 --> 00:31:00,160
lake bed and they went out to pick up their cameras and moved on out toward him filming

323
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,360
and he left it off put the gear back in the well and climbed out a very high rate of speed and

324
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,320
disappeared and so while i was going through all the regulation books and finding out the number

325
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,640
to call and watching to report it i had to go over and develop the film the time they got back

326
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,200
with the developed film i was on the higher and higher and higher level officer talking to me

327
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,880
finally with the colonel telling me to you know when the film arrived at my desk to put it in the

328
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,960
carrier pouch there would be a courier there at my office by that time already and they'd range for

329
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:51,680
him to fly in our base airplane back to washington with these films and uh do not run prints etc etc

330
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,960
etc so we stuck them in the courier pouch did you watch the film we didn't have a chance to run it i

331
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,000
had a chance to hold it up to the window and look at it it was certainly a good film good close-up

332
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:13,120
good close-up shot in 1972 we can find project outgrowth out of the usaf rocket propulsion

333
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,640
lab at edwards a document titled advanced propulsion concepts project outgrowth

334
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,600
sees discussion of an anti-gravity program and theoretical material to change the direction

335
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,680
and amplitude of gravitational fields similarly in 1988 a technical report submitted under

336
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,480
contract with the usaf aeronautics lab out of edwards discusses the exploration of the

337
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,200
bifield brown effect explored at length by jessie michaels which allegedly converts

338
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,960
electrostatic energy into propulsion around the same year 1988 defense contractor science

339
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,480
applications international corporation saic a defense contractor i have directly implicated

340
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,520
in the study of off-world technologies studied similar electronic propulsion mechanisms for

341
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,120
edwards air force base we can also look to 1990 where journalist scott williams wrote an article

342
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,240
in aviation week in which 45 sightings of aircraft accelerating from near hovering positions to

343
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,680
supersonic speeds were seen over edwards air force base george air force base in china lake

344
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,760
naval weapons center one such craft was described as triangular in shape but let's not forget the

345
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
1998 testimony of usaf master sergeant edgar foush i have covered numerous times who commented on the

346
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,600
infamous tr 3b reverse engineered triangular craft foush claimed while working at the defense

347
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,680
advanced research board in 1979 under the jet propulsion laboratory at edwards a full anti-gravity

348
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,360
propulsion system was developed and a secret space fleet utilized this technology if you haven't

349
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,800
yet please watch my video on locking martin as i discussed the foush case in much greater depth

350
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,000
including his station at the proposed defense advanced research center while discussing the tr

351
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,680
3b craft foush makes specific mention graduates from the 412th test pilot school at edwards

352
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,520
air force base pilot these reverse engineered craft many more enigmatic claims without direct

353
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,720
evidence exists surrounding edwards the infamous base was mentioned myriad times within lenard

354
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,160
stringfield's crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7 in ufo crash retrievals the inner

355
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:20,080
sanctum status report 6 stringfield makes mention of a doctor epigoni a pseudonym for a physicist

356
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:26,080
who claimed to have worked closely with oppenheimer einstein and teller epigoni stated in the late

357
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,520
60s early 70s he worked on something called project heaven a special projects at edwards

358
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,240
air force base the doctor claimed a flying saucer and its crew had previously landed

359
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,360
at edwards the craft was kept in a large hanger guarded tightly whilst occupants were carted off

360
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,680
to a secure building for evaluation the 12 five foot tall bodies clad in silvery metal suits featured

361
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:54,400
eyes of one color a nose a mouth teeth and blood similar to the appearance of oil to quote epigoni

362
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,400
they the u.s researchers came to the conclusion that since there was no deterioration to leave

363
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,120
them alone because another craft might come in the area and rejuvenate or reactivate them

364
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,960
end quote the craft itself had no rivets seams or welding and was of a classic saucer design with

365
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,880
a dome on top measuring 40 feet in diameter other scientists informed epigoni craft materials

366
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,520
were made of materials they never dreamed could exist and could not figure out a way to gain

367
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,440
entry to the craft epigoni stated as of 1990 project blue heaven was still active it was run

368
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,920
by the dod and the navy had two to three similar projects the doctor's account is far more detailed

369
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,400
and i promise we will circle back to this testimony in future projects but the landing of this craft

370
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
and seemingly inert bodies reminds me closely of the craft donation theory when you say crash

371
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,640
retrieval what do you make these are retrieving non-human origin uh technical vehicles you know

372
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,200
call it spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed

373
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:06,320
we have spacecraft from another species we do yeah how many quite a number you're kidding no the

374
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,040
strangest detail of this testimony is the claim the craft touched down the beans walked out of

375
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,400
the craft and laid on the ground it's worth noting and stringfield commented on this too

376
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,160
epigoni changed the body count from 12 to 4 according to stringfield and his fellow investigator

377
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,200
they quote agreed that it appeared that he had consulted with his superiors and was advised to

378
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,840
alter certain key details end quote also in 1991 status report six stringfield recounts his discussions

379
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,640
with a firsthand witness to a ufo crash retrieval 15 miles outside of edwards in 1971 according to

380
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,760
witness debbie clayton her and her girlfriend's family investigated a crash from the sky in broad

381
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,600
daylight reaching the craft site debbie observed an acorn-shaped craft with an extremely similar

382
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,600
description to the kexburg crash quote we searched for markings but found only some old scratches

383
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,200
that we could not read because it was upright we couldn't see the bottom there were no windows

384
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,440
or seams appearing to be made from a one-piece mold if i remember correctly it was a dark grayish

385
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,120
color with greenish highlights not a color one normally sees there was a mild heat coming from

386
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,840
the craft somewhat like a car engine after traveling for an hour one more thing i thought

387
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,960
was strange there was no dust that clung to the shell here in the desert dust is everywhere

388
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,240
and clings to everything end quote according to debbie an air force car and truck arrived within

389
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,320
14 minutes where men with rifles ordered civilians off scene lastly i want to cover an excerpt michael

390
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,640
schratt discovered in the files of the late stringfield which may allow us to directly connect

391
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,720
edwards to operating arv and ny craft alongside area 51 s4 in a letter dated april 5th 1980

392
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,080
one mr d l dobs discussed one mh a witness identity schratt chose not to disclose mh had

393
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,320
allegedly performed radio maintenance at the atomic proving ground in nevada during 1961 to 1963

394
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,160
along with top secret radio work for usaff according to mh he participated in a top secret

395
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,240
operation at area 51 titled project red light test flights were conducted on a recovered ufo

396
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,440
ship from none other than edwards air force base the craft was not conventionally powered

397
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,640
and stayed silent during operation security was so tight on the project program personnel were

398
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,800
rotated every six months mh claimed to have heard rumors of a west coast american defense contractor

399
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,800
encountering difficulties in many of the components comprising the craft

400
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,720
and lastly guys i want to cover a possible connection between reverse engineering programs

401
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,000
at edwards and nella slash area 51 in july of 1991 an alleged classified nr o document leaked to

402
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,440
the public this document informed need to know groups and operations about civilian flying

403
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,320
saucer organizations organizing protests in nevada steven greer claimed to have given the

404
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,760
document to admiral thomas wilson from the wilson davis memo which at the very least we can confirm

405
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,520
the meeting between greer and wilson allegedly wilson told greer he recognized one of the entities

406
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,760
listed and that it was run by a contractor addressed in this document includes royal ops cosmic ops

407
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:27,840
mage ops magi ops multiple usaf special forces divisions in the 26th 64th 65th 527th nella's

408
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,400
afos i groom lake and dreamland area 51 s4 aquatec and sea spray special operations group

409
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,400
and one blackjack team according to dr steven greer inside sources including a source inside

410
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,280
blackjack control told him of two entities blackjack control and blackjack team blackjack control is

411
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,320
allegedly a nella's based facility participating in reverse engineering while blackjack team

412
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,920
operates in conjunction with control but is stationed at edwards air force base so but the

413
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,800
key facilities i want to go through and there are others this is a list um that i've updated i

414
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,400
updated it um for the president in 09 um a very chief one is edwards air force base and there's

415
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:18,240
a whole constellation there haystack butte china lakes george air force base they retired norton

416
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:26,480
air force base tabletop mountain observatory which is run ostensibly by nasa and blackjack control

417
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,720
though i had a source at blackjack control associated with the edwards related facilities

418
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:41,440
but the blackjack team you saw on that list was nella's so there's blackjack control and blackjack

419
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,520
team i can find almost nothing publicly available to research on blackjack besides a late 2010s

420
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,120
early 2020s project between darpa the defense advanced research project and defense contractors

421
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,320
owned by raytheon project blackjack was quote intended to develop and demonstrate critical

422
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,440
elements of a global high-speed network in low earth orbit that satisfied dod performance and

423
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,400
payload requirements at a much lower cost with shorter design cycles and with easier and more

424
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,960
frequent technology upgrades and quote seen as the alleged nro document dates back to 1991 i doubt

425
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,680
these two blackjacks connect what's going on guys it's uap gerb and i'd like to thank each

426
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,200
and every single one of you for joining me today as we took a deep dive into ed's witness testimony

427
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,120
now i know i discussed this a multitude of times throughout today's video but i'd like to reiterate

428
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,920
today's thesis once more for a final time analyzing ed's credible witness testimony

429
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,840
conclusions can be drawn of a joint reverse engineering program focused on craft of non-human

430
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:52,000
intelligence existing between edwards air force base california and nella's air force base nevada

431
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,040
slash area 51 s4 this program stems out of the 412th test group comprising the edwards

432
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,080
usaf test pilot school and edwards 412th electronics warfare group now this research was

433
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,960
some of the most enticing exciting and interesting i have done since working on the off-world

434
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,760
technologies division and i would like to compare these two testimonies the off-world

435
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,440
technologies division and the technology here focused more on singular pieces of technology

436
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,480
and almost weapons as described by r.a. now it was interesting to see the juxtaposition between

437
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,320
this air force testimony as the air force plants in conjunction with a lockheed martin bowing and

438
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,440
possibly other contractors actually work on the piloting and utilization of reverse engineered

439
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,440
craft whether these craft are triangular in shape the classic tr 3b as proposed by fauche

440
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,920
or possibly the flux liner classic saucer shape as proposed by mark mcandalish that were housed at

441
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,160
allegedly housed at dormant air force base 1988 i'm not sure perhaps it's both but the line that

442
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,520
fauche states that these pilots put commanded the reverse engineer tr 3b is out of edwards air

443
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,400
force base pilot test uh test school jumped out to me after covering him so long ago in my lockheed

444
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,720
martin video this research was fascinating i wish we could find out a little more on ed's time at

445
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,080
the pentagon all we really have to go off there is the 34 billion dollars and then 40 billion

446
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,320
dollars missing in uh transfer of authorization funds off book funds this can possibly support

447
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,640
greers and other people's thesis that many of these programs are funded through black budget

448
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,800
operations i know that this uh program at at edwards edwards is a very populous base so

449
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,400
if this reverse engineering program is indeed real this must be kept to an exclusively small

450
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,240
number of personnel in an exclusively small area who knows perhaps edwards is connected to

451
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,120
underground facilities in this region i know greer likes to say that the uh anthill facility he

452
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,080
posted a picture of recently in the uh helendale facility are done location so possibly this is a

453
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,880
kind of a connected area in which craft are stored after hearing ed's testimony what do you guys

454
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,320
think i would like nothing more than to speak to ed firsthand and hear all this information

455
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:19,360
from himself but unfortunately he has gone off books there is no way to contact this individual

456
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:26,640
whether by phone social media or email and believe me i have tried so if greer is right and this

457
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:33,040
individual has tested revealed testified revealing information he knows this testimony is indeed

458
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,760
impactful beyond belief but has he or is that one of greer's embellishments we don't know

459
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,160
i'd like more than anything to see this individual ed before the senate intelligence

460
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,960
committee or at november's open hearings who knows maybe we'll be surprised to do so but

461
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,120
let me know what you guys think about this alleged reverse engineering program at uh

462
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,640
edwards air force base and nellis air force base area 51 again if anybody has any other further

463
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,000
research to let me know about this i would love to know i know that uh i drew a conclusion i decided

464
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,920
not to keep it in the video about the air force plant 42 near palm dale sightings of late and

465
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,440
edwards these two facilities are only about 30 miles apart which uh you know very interesting i

466
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,880
think edwards and norton are also only about 80 miles apart so this whole complex is deeply entwined

467
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,720
to both ufo sightings and testimonies of reverse engineering programs i was also thrilled to be

468
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,600
able to dive into the work of lennard stringfield and others to look at some more occasions i know

469
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,560
we uh researched the debbie clayton acorn-shaped craft 15 miles outside of edward that was

470
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:41,040
immediately swarmed by usaff crew within 15 minutes and the testimony of dr epigoni that

471
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,840
one is very interesting uh relating to the craft donation theory if you don't know what that is

472
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,920
certain individuals like david grush have discussed that some retrievals of uap are not

473
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,600
crash retrievals these craft are just found left unattended this story reminded closely of the

474
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,520
alleged 1957 hollamann air force base landing in which a flying saucer saucer touched down at

475
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,560
hollamann air force base and occupants walked out of the craft to interact with usaff personnel

476
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,440
in epigoni's case these beings walked out of the craft to lay down on the ground and seemingly

477
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,080
turned themselves off which could possibly attest to the the theory of biological robots

478
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,800
essentially as many people like to call the grays there will be further research that needs to be

479
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,920
done on blackjack team and blackjack control this just rang a note in my head from that 1991

480
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,360
alleged nro document but more research needs to be done here thus far i can find no connections

481
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:46,480
between darpa really but this to me is the jumping off point of researching usaff legacy and contractor

482
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,600
reverse engineering programs possibly housed at contractor sites possibly housed at air force

483
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,640
base locations so let me know what you guys think i really appreciate everybody joining me today

484
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,320
please remember to like and subscribe uh share these videos around i got a patreon if you want to

join i don't charge for any extra content i don't gate keep content all of my research is free for

486
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,160
anybody to consume i only have the patreon if you want to support what you think the channel's worth

487
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,320
but guys i have some awesome upcoming other projects on arvs or alien reproduction vehicles

488
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,120
including a deep dive on mark mcandalish which i hope to do soon i know that's been highly requested

489
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,560
and i cannot wait to do so so without further ado guys i want to thank you all again for joining me
