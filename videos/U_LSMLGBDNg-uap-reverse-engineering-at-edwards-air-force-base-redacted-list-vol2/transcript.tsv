0	5520	So here is your list. I'm not going to go through 145 sites. Some of them are black
5520	10880	sites. Some of them are bases, you know, about like Wright Patterson, Edwards, Nellis, Area 51,
10880	17680	so-called. But all of them are based on witness testimony and intelligence we've gathered over
17680	24000	the last 30 years and it's time for it to be disclosed. Recently in 2024, Stephen Greer in
24000	29040	the Disclosure Project released their entire catalog of documents, communication logs,
29040	34160	drawings, and other files. Love them or hate them, over the years, Greer has provided valuable
34160	40480	witnesses a platform to speak and wrote in my opinion a truly fantastic piece of work,
40480	45280	his 2001 Disclosure Briefing document. So while I have my problems with Greer,
45280	51040	this document archive absolutely commands my attention. Greer's list of UFO whistleblowers
51040	56720	and witnesses features over 700 names, many of which are redacted. Here we find names we all
56720	62880	expect. Michael Herrera, the late Dr. Robert Wood, Richard Doty, Robert Salas, Jonathan Wagan,
62880	69200	even Bob Lazar. But we also find 22 pages of redacted names. Some of these names are described
69200	74080	simply as points of contact to others, but some have descriptions that might be well worth our
74080	80000	attention. Viewers of my channel may remember UFO witnesses redacted list in which I derived the
80000	85120	names and contacted two of these witnesses from poorly redacted documents uploaded by Greer.
85120	90640	One such witness MS agreed to interview on UFO testing occurring at Dugway Proving Grounds while
90640	96240	the other witness TB was much more shadowy. Today we cover the redacted entry that has
96240	101920	captivated my attention and commanded my research for months on end. A witness I have been more than
101920	107200	eager to cover as I believe this witness's alleged first-hand experiences with UFO reverse
107200	114240	engineering offer crucial insights into DOD and defense contractor involvement with UFO programs.
114240	119600	Hey guys it's UAP Gerb and thank you so much for joining me today. I am beyond excited to cover
119600	126320	another witness in Steven Greer's redacted list. Witness 11063 who makes claims of testing UAP
126320	131920	reverse engineer technology and craft at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Grab your pencils and
131920	137200	notebooks because we have a tremendous amount of research to conduct and avenues to explore from
137200	142800	two simple documents on this former wing commander at Edwards. And before we get started guys full
142800	147680	disclaimer I have been able to ascertain this individual's identity and have tried to contact
147680	153200	him through myriad methods. Should he ever respond and be willing to go public I will go to any lengths
153200	158640	to speak with him. But for operational security and his family's safety I will not burn witness
158640	164400	11063's identity. I have also attempted to encourage this individual to testify before
164400	169520	Congress or contact the Senate Intelligence Committee. For this project I will only be using
169520	175120	publicly available sources no classified or hidden information will be disclosed in this video.
175120	180240	And I would like to say I have thoroughly vetted this individual through public online resources
180240	185040	and can confirm his Air Force station at Nellis Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and the
185040	190080	Pentagon as well as various positions within the U.S. Air Force as stated by Greer.
190080	200960	I first took note of witness 11063 who I will further refer to as Ed when Dr. Greer released
200960	207760	his witness list. This astonishing entry reads quote career Air Force Nellis Edwards test director
207760	213840	of electronics warfare group tested reverse engineer technology was at the Pentagon DOE
214400	222400	Wing commander at Edwards contacted us in 2023 end quote unlike MSTB and myriad other witnesses no
222400	227840	communications or files existed on Ed at the initial release of the DPI archive files.
227840	232560	It wasn't until late summer of 2024 the disclosure project intelligence archive
232560	237360	updated an additional section of documents intelligence briefing modules that we would
237360	243680	get our first leads on Ed within this section we find module three under UFO crash retrievals
243680	249200	titled quote covert government retrieval and handling ET vehicles end quote analyzing the
249200	254480	executive summary we find some fascinating information adapted from a March 2024 oral
254480	261120	presentation from Greer not only does Greer discuss 130 plus instances of NHI objects being
261120	266160	downed and retrieved involving major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Skunkworks
266160	272320	and Boeing but these operations are conducted using advanced electrocovidic technologies
272320	278480	and electromagnetic pulse EMP weapons I do highly recommend reading through the entirety of this
278480	283840	module as it invokes the quality of the 2001 disclosure briefing document and also makes
283840	290400	mention of witness MS and Richard Focch a formal naval research lab senior scientist who discussed
290400	297760	large silent triangular alien reproduction vehicles over remote areas of dugway proving grounds
297760	302960	towards the end of module three we see our first discussion of Ed outside the witness list quote
302960	308240	a lieutenant colonel who managed pilots at Edwards Air Force Base and is responsible for training
308240	314400	pilots who operated man-made UFOs has expressed his willingness to share his information openly
314400	318560	Dr. Greer introduced him to the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee
318560	324160	where he shared information he is also eager to testify openly before the House Oversight Committee
324160	329280	though responses from key members like reps Luna and Bershet have not yet been received
329280	334560	having left the Air Force in 2009 the Lieutenant Colonel was extensively briefed on operations
334560	340400	not just at Edwards but also at Nellison area 51 he believes that since the operations he was
340400	346080	involved in were illegal he is free to discuss them publicly and is ready to disclose everything
346080	352160	he knows in an open hearing under oath end quote it was around the time of the upload of this module
352160	356960	Greer finally uploaded two documents under witness 11063
362400	367040	first let's analyze what I would consider to be the less impactful of the two documents on Ed
367040	372960	to understand his background and motives for contacting Greer in late 2023 in presumably an
372960	377920	internal disclosure project email an unknown individual emailed Greer stating witness Ed
377920	382720	had been following Greer's work for some time and wish to answer Greer's call for whistleblowers
383440	390240	this dpi employee states Ed served in USAF from 1999 to his early retirement in 2015
390240	395760	where he ended his career according to the email Ed additionally came from an engineering background
395760	400640	worked with the Department of Energy and served at the Pentagon for seven years the email accurately
400640	405360	breaks down Ed's service record three years at Nellis Air Force Base Nevada three years at
405360	411840	Hanscom Air Force Base Massachusetts and five years at Edwards Air Force Base California in 2006
411840	417760	Ed was sent to Edwards AFB for the bases test pilot school it was here Ed would claim pilots at the
417760	423440	Air Force Base are trained for unacknowledged special access programs using reverse engineered
423440	429840	non-human technology side note Edwards is well known for its prolific and prestigious test pilot
430320	435600	this highly selective program trains pilots navigators and engineers on experimental flight
435600	441360	platforms originating from the Air Force material commands 412th test wing the test pilot school's
441360	447200	mission is to quote conduct full spectrum tests and evaluations of aerospace weapons and to be
447200	452320	the world's premier educational and training center for theoretical and applied flight test
452320	457440	engineering end quote an additional point the test pilot school originated out of Wright Patterson
457440	462880	Air Force Base during World War two during his time at Edwards after graduating the USAF's highly
462880	468160	selective test pilot school Ed would serve as the head of an electronic warfare group that tested
468160	474080	NHI reverse engineered technology in this role Ed claimed to serve as the intermediary between
474080	479440	engineers who had direct reporting to him and test pilots when quote they had a manned craft they
479440	484960	were testing end quote interesting to point out here according to the email Ed agrees with Dr.
484960	490800	Greer stance on free energy systems from direct firsthand involvement in various projects a little
490800	495920	bit of context here since the late 90s early 2000s Greer has highlighted issues of suppressed
495920	501040	technologies and systems levied from the reverse engineering of off world technologies these
501040	507440	technologies are famously referred to as zero point energy systems to quote the 2001 disclosure
507440	512240	document quote we have identified insiders and scientists who can prove in open congressional
512240	517920	hearings that we do in fact possess classified energy generation and anti-gravity propulsion
517920	523200	systems capable of completely and permanently replacing all forms of current used energy
523200	529040	generation and transport systems these devices access the ambient electromagnetic and so called
529040	534320	zero point energy state to produce vast amounts of energy without any pollution such systems
534320	540080	essentially generate energy by tapping into the ever present quantum vacuum energy state the baseline
540080	545520	energy from which all energy and matter is fluxing all matter and energy is supported by this baseline
545520	550320	energy state and it can be tapped through unique electromagnetic circuits and configurations
550320	555440	to generate huge amounts of energy from space time all around us these are not perpetual
555440	560480	motion machines nor do they violate the laws of thermodynamics they merely tap an ambient energy
560480	565840	field all around us to generate energy end quote zero point and free energy systems are not the
565840	570960	topic of today's video so i recommend reading the hunt for zero point by author nick cook jesse
570960	576560	michael's video aerospace secret search for anti-gravity or even greer's 2023 documentary the
576560	581280	lost century and how to reclaim it and it is interesting and worth noting that this internal
581280	587360	disclosure project email states ed is in complete agreement with greer stance on free energy ed isn't
587360	593840	the only witness to comment on zero point systems either take redacted entry 10 747 for example who
593840	600000	is stated to be an x chairman and vp of a well-known corporation i have high conviction this company
600000	606560	is general electric according to greer 10 747 has quote huge details and testimony regarding free
606560	612320	energy and the military industrial complex cover-up slash suppression of these technologies
612320	618240	no several people killed and scared to death end quote towards the end of our witness testimony
618240	623440	internal email mention is made ed had been tracking current legislation relating to legacy program
623440	629040	member amnesty and would be willing to testify to aero as long as kirk patrick was removed from
629040	635760	the organization because according to ed the good doctor quote is an insider and is meant to squash
635760	641760	information end quote this is indeed a very charged statement and one i am sure many ufo
641760	648160	investigators will agree with based off the actions of sean kirk patrick and the way you combat conspiracy
648160	656400	theories and and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact and science and truth
656400	664320	so if you've got evidence for conspiracy then then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth
664320	671600	is there has been none that has been substantiated for this and everything that has been brought to
671600	677040	our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when i was in that position as the
677040	684320	director we investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from
684320	691680	most everything was explainable through other documentation other programs other people that
691680	697520	had talked to other people it goes without saying dr k has very little goodwill with the public
697520	703040	like the lies and half-hearted debunks in the aero historical report volume one or aero's 2022
703040	709440	contracts with sandcorp a company built to plug whistleblower leaks i have even made an entire video
709440	714160	on sean kirk patrick and his disinformation which is at this point somewhat outdated as it covered
714160	718960	little of kirk patrick's role as an unpaid consultant after leaving aero so let's briefly
718960	724080	cover a new revelation that supports ed's accusations of the doctor injecting misinformation
724080	730480	into the public well in a recent us space command foyer release by twitter user tag underscore om
730480	736240	we can find a january 2023 meeting scheduled by dr kirk patrick involving us space com and
736240	742560	senior us joint command staff the purpose of this meeting was quote uap response and recovery and
742560	748400	material transfer end quote the witness testimony document gives us a brief overview of ed his
748400	753200	background and motives but our next document is where our true research can begin
753440	763440	this two-page set of notes roughly covers a phone conversation between dr grier and ed on
763440	770480	november 25th 2023 not only do these notes describe ed's testimony in depth but also break down his
770480	777280	military career by year and station the document is absolutely worth going through line by line
777280	782560	off the bat ed asks rear if he has threatened legal action against lockheed and bowing as ed
782560	787040	was read into programs overlapping these two companies at the beginning of his air force
787040	792800	career ed did indeed work with lockheed as a range technical contractor in the early 2000s at nellis
792800	798080	air force base along with some other smaller specialized contractors however there is no
798080	803360	mention of bowing to the best of my knowledge in his work history publicly we can find myriad
803360	807920	projects and current job openings for work between lockheed and nellis air force base but there are
807920	813120	a few of extreme interest here check out this lockheed martin case study titled the importance
813120	817600	of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in which the contractor was tasked with updating
817600	822640	the system used by usaf warfare center for intelligence collection and processing lockheed
822640	828000	martin reconfigured a two-phase security classification system used by the national geospatial
828000	833680	intelligence system yes the same agency grush was a part of when liaison to the uap task force
833680	838880	and the same agency recently mentioned by respected journalist chris sharp as participating in
838880	845200	undersea uap crash retrievals the system was implemented to combined air and space operation
845200	850320	center at nellis air force base which is tasked with processing information for exploitation of
850320	855920	time sensitive targets i can't help but speculate here although this lockheed project arose from
855920	862080	challenges in the nellis red flag advanced aerial combat training exercise could such systems be used
862160	869360	to monitor uap and uap crash retrievals the idea ed was read into uap programs at nellis air force
869360	875360	base as a first lieutenant from 1999 to 2002 can possibly be reinforced later in the notes where
875360	882480	greer states ed was briefed at area 51 s4 where quote a major said they had caught slash captured
882480	887920	lots of aircraft end quote this small point will later become even more interesting as we learn
887920	893200	the area 51 groom lake facility is administered by a detachment from edwards air force base
893200	899040	california the base where ed would transfer to and conduct the bulk of his first hand work around
899040	905520	uap programs ed states this briefing was conducted via a 30 minute video which showed inspection
905520	912240	aircraft that were essentially invisible inspection craft what exactly does this mean is ed referring
912240	919600	to crash retrievals or possibly alien reproduction vehicles arvs for inspection use only this reminds
919600	925280	me closely of the story of mark mcandellish whose close friend brad sorenson allegedly saw three
925280	931840	arvs titled flux liners that were available for cleared personnel to inspect with paneling removed
931840	937280	to highlight hardware of the craft the linings craft were essentially invisible further supports
937360	942880	this thesis as i have covered firsthand witnesses before that have discussed arv craft with cloaking
942880	948480	mechanisms craft that look identical to the flux liner highlighted by mcandellish and an
948480	953280	interesting detail according to sorenson and mcandellish these arvs were shown at norton air
953280	958880	force base a mere 80 miles from edwards air force base if you're unfamiliar with the testimony of
958880	964080	mark mcandellish have no fear i will cover it soon as i believe it is one of the most impactful
964080	969680	testimonies in all of ufology greer goes on to state that at nellis air force base nevada
969680	976320	ed worked at building 200 under the redacted name of the first commander of the 98th range wing now
976320	981920	let's break this down the 98th range wing now called the nevada test and training range began
981920	987760	operations in 2001 and serves as the primary military training area for the nellis air force
987760	994160	base complex to quote usaf the nttr is the largest contiguous air and ground space available for
994160	1001120	peacetime military operations in the free world the range occupies 2.9 million acres of land 5000
1001120	1006160	square miles of airspace which is restricted from civilian air traffic overflight and quote
1006160	1011760	the nevada test and training range nttr provides the warfighter of flexible realistic and multi
1011760	1016640	dimensional battle space to conduct testing tactics development and advanced training and
1016640	1022160	support of us national interests while also conducting department of energy testing research
1022160	1027840	and development quote the nttr coordinates operational and support matters with major
1027840	1033680	commands other services do e and department of interior as well as other federal state and
1033680	1040160	local government agencies the nttr acts as the single point of contact for range customers and
1040160	1046080	quote analyzing the nttr and its mission to create operate and maintain live and synthetic
1046080	1051600	environments and integrate partners to optimize warfighter capabilities this location sounds
1051600	1057920	like an ideal choice for do d and usg elements alongside contractors to test reverse engineer
1057920	1065040	technology to top it off the nttr south range contains groom lake area 51 a location deeply
1065040	1071840	entwined with ufology his time at building 200 at the nttr may have seen ed interact with boeing
1071840	1077680	lachid martin alongside the doe which i mentioned i could find no record of in his resume circling
1077680	1082800	back to the call notes greer made specific note to ed serving under the first commander right around
1082800	1090080	2001 of the 98th range wing or nttr i have tried at length and failed to find the original commander
1090080	1095760	of the 98th but i would like to take a long hard look at the commander from 2005 to 2007
1095760	1101760	colonel christopher haves i find this analysis necessary as ed may have implied the 98th commander
1101760	1107600	has oversight to uap reverse engineering programs colonel haves spent 26 years in the air force
1107600	1112560	linked to key roles in fighter aviation his post service resume is of heavy interest here
1113120	1117840	following the air force and its service in the 98th range wing haves directed global trade
1117840	1123440	controls at boeing in washington dc handling trade policy and technology licensing within
1123440	1128960	major government departments haves additionally led a team at raytheon technologies another defense
1128960	1135200	contractor implicated with uap study here the colonel managed relationships with key usg officials
1135200	1140160	such as the office of the secretary of defense and other military departments aligning raytheon
1140160	1145600	strategies within government objectives the colonel also served as a special advisor on national
1145600	1150800	security affairs to then vice president dick cheney who has seen swirls of rumors recently
1150800	1156320	implicating cheney as a senior member of ufo programs where have offered insights on foreign
1156320	1161760	defense capabilities haves resume as well as his role as commander of the 98th range wing
1161760	1167600	offers us a glimpse at a possible reverse engineering program official and speaking of the nttr in
1167600	1173920	greer's notes we can find a simple sentence quote ed saw man-made craft on the range was there quite
1173920	1179280	a bit end quote with strong conviction we can assume the range in question here is the nttr
1179280	1185200	from this statement we can also gauge that ed is claiming area 51 slash s4 and or nellis
1185200	1191280	air force base has successful man-made reverse engineered craft greer then comments on ed being
1191280	1197120	sent to edwards air force base in california in 2006 for range orientation where ed would go on to
1197120	1202880	serve as director of redacted for an electronic warfare group referencing the witness testimony
1202880	1207680	document we can assume this director role was a test director for a technology reverse engineering
1207680	1212640	group we can also assume from witness testimony this station followed ed's service in edwards
1212640	1218080	test pilot school what bolsters these claims from ed is the fact edwards electronic warfare group
1218080	1224800	stems from the 412th test wing the exact same wing that houses the edwards usaf test pilot school
1224800	1230720	if ed's testimony is true the 412th test wing out of edwards directly deals with the testing of
1230720	1237040	reverse engineered craft and technology of non-human origin this would also mean the 412th
1237040	1242320	reverse engineering program works in conjunction with the nevada test in training range this is
1242320	1248400	one of the biggest takeaways of this entire research project if his testimony is true ed was
1248400	1254080	briefed on uap programs at s4 while stationed at nellis where he was then sent to the 412th
1254080	1260160	test pilot school and test wing to further this work in an air force legacy ufo program as a test
1260160	1267200	director the document state ed served at nellis until 2002 and was then sent to edwards in 2006
1267200	1274000	where was ed during this gap this period of time 2002 to 2005 saw ed stationed at handscom
1274000	1279680	air force based near boston massachusetts greer writes that ed worked with the massachusetts
1279680	1285360	institute of technology while at handscom working on foreign military assets but only saw terrestrial
1286160	1291040	this mention of mit is still of great interest to us i've talked before about the involvement of
1291040	1297520	ua rc or university affiliated research centers with uap programs many times most recently with
1297520	1303280	dr eric a walker head of penn states ua rc the applied research laboratory who admitted he was
1303280	1309520	involved in the keksburg ufo crash incident while mit has their own ua rc operating under the us
1309520	1314400	army as well the institute for soldier nano technologies whose goal is to quote discover
1314400	1320240	and feel technologies that dramatically improve the protection survivability and mission capabilities
1320240	1325360	of the warfighter and of warfighter supporting platforms and systems and quote the only mention
1325360	1330000	i can find of relation between handscom and uap is an anonymous letter sent to Leonard
1330000	1336400	stringfield dated march 14th 1975 which claimed to recount the testimony of one colonel sims a
1336400	1342080	pseudonym according to the letter both handscom and mit are two of the military bases and research
1342080	1349040	laboratories that perform ufo operations alongside edwards right paterson carswell los alamos sandia
1349040	1355520	etc okay so ed served at edwards from 2006 to 2010 where he was allegedly formally read into
1355520	1360960	multiple quote unquote advanced aircraft programs at edwards the use of the word formal here is
1360960	1365200	quite interesting almost like ed's time at nellis saw him getting bits and pieces of program
1365200	1370400	information while his role as test director saw a complete briefing this echoes numerous claims
1370400	1375200	that uap reverse engineering programs are as if not more compartmentalized than the manhattan
1375200	1381360	atomic bomb project greer writes in 2008 when director of a redacted program ed was part of a
1381360	1388080	go public plan via the air force the plan was called off in 2009 to 2010 and saw ed move to the
1388080	1393760	pentagon the killing of the program was done by a two star general now i have found no confirming
1393760	1399440	evidence of this so-called go public plan but i have found a series of use of two star generals aka
1399440	1404160	major generals that either retired as major generals or were at the time period of interest
1404160	1409840	that may give us an answer one prime suspect is major general thomas k anderson who reached
1409840	1416080	the rank of major general in 2009 and retired in 2013 anderson's senior role oversaw him
1416080	1421920	serving as commander of the curtis e lemay center for doctrine development and education
1421920	1426480	to quote the air force quote the center is responsible for the research development and
1426480	1432000	production of air force doctrine and input for joint and multinational doctrine development
1432000	1438240	activities and quote general anderson oversaw numerous key positions within do d such as the
1438240	1443520	air staff joint staff combat command staffs nato and chief of staff and director of intelligence
1443520	1449520	for us strategic command let us also inspect major general u jean haas who served as brigadier
1449520	1456400	general during our window 2009 to 2010 before being promoted to major general in 2012 haas served as
1456400	1462160	vice commander air force special operations command from 2009 to 2011 haas additionally
1462160	1468320	acted as director for force structure requirements resources and strategic assessment as a j8 haas
1468320	1472800	commanded my interest due to his extremely prestigious role within do d and station at
1472800	1478800	two air force bases allegedly connected to uap programs mac dill air force base and fort belvois
1478800	1483920	virginia moving on i would like to look at major general kcd blake who earned his major
1483920	1489760	general ship in 2015 and served as a colonel during ed's alleged disclosure plan not only
1489760	1494720	did general blake work as commander to air force installations contracting agency of assistant
1494720	1499840	secretary of the air force for acquisition at right paterson air force base ohio but his most
1499840	1505280	senior position saw blake as the deputy assistant secretary for contracting under the office of
1505280	1511440	the assistant secretary for air force for acquisition in washington dc here he was responsible for quote
1511440	1516560	all aspects of contracting relating to the acquisition of weapon systems logistics and
1516560	1523920	operational support for the air force end quote overseeing support of 826 billion dollars annually
1523920	1528880	although blake may have been a colonel during this plan he piqued my interest as during 2008 he
1528880	1534000	served as director program acquisitions defense procurement and acquisition policy in the office
1534000	1539440	of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics for the pentagon there
1539440	1544880	are a total of four other major generals of interest here including c donald allston h brent
1544880	1552320	blake senior randy ap but i want to lastly focus on major general christopher p asano asano did not
1552320	1558560	earn his major general ship until 2019 meaning during 2009 to 2010 he is the least likely
1558560	1563600	candidate to have decision-making power over a disclosure campaign however his early career
1563600	1569920	dovetails almost identically with that of ed and is worth mentioning in the year 2000 asano attended
1569920	1575360	usav test pilot school at you guessed it edwards in the early 2010s the general would command the
1575360	1580800	412th operations group at edwards before serving as the commander of the air force test center at
1580800	1587440	edwards at his senior station asano oversaw a 31 billion dollar enterprise comprised of more than
1587440	1595200	19 000 military civilian and contractor personnel across edwards aigland and arnold afb's greer
1595200	1599600	makes special note to right paterson air force base the infamous location we have discussed in
1599600	1604000	almost every single video i have ever done according to ed right paterson has a tight
1604000	1609920	connection with edwards ed even makes an educated guess right pat's hangar six specifically held
1609920	1615760	by a logics according to internal right pat documents hangar six was initially quote primarily
1615760	1620880	used by the signal corps for installing radios and antennas and after the war it became a facility
1620880	1626080	for retrofitting and modifying planes and quote the hangar featured several smaller doors instead
1626080	1631520	of a giant hangar door which would later be used as the right field fitness center however the fitness
1631520	1638080	center is located in hangar 22 not hangar six at right pat besides blueprints and images of the
1638080	1644560	exterior i can find almost zero internal images reports or articles in general on hangar six
1644560	1650000	this facility will be a priority of my research moving forward especially analyzing for infrastructure
1650000	1656640	to support living and or deceased biologics as ed has claimed from 2010 to 2015 following the failed
1656640	1661200	coming forward plan ed moved to the pentagon where according to greer he operated within research
1661200	1666000	and development panel chain little was discussed between greer and ed on his responsibilities
1666000	1671920	at the pentagon however one interesting note is recorded quote 34 billion dollars than 40 billion
1671920	1678880	dollars to non air force authorization non blue toa and quote toa meaning transfer of authority
1678880	1683040	this statement seemingly confirms statements made over the decades by numerous whistleblowers
1683040	1689360	discussing uap programs being funded through usap off book black operations i will draw your attention
1689360	1694240	to december 11th 2017 where former assistant secretary of housing and urban development
1694240	1699920	kathryn austin fits published a paper titled black budget of the united states here she discussed
1699920	1704640	21 trillion dollars found in unauthorized spending in the department of defense and
1704640	1711200	housing and urban development centers between 1998 and 2015 soon after publication the dod
1711200	1715680	announced its first ever department wide independent audit fits personally believed
1715680	1721360	some unauthorized funding was utilized for domestic clandestine military rnd some of
1721920	1724240	legal uap programs from dod
1729440	1734640	the primary testimony of ed involves first-hand work on uap programs focused on the testing
1734640	1740560	of reverse engineered non-human technology at nellis air force base slash area 51 s4
1740560	1746160	and the 412th test group out of edwards air force base california as we have discussed before
1746160	1751440	numerous factors including ed being briefed at s4 and then sent to the 412th for test pilot
1751440	1756640	school before becoming director of the electronic warfare group where he acted as the intermediary
1756640	1762080	between engineers and test pilots when the group had manned craft to test we can conclude with
1762080	1767680	high confidence ed's work revolved primarily around the utilization of nhi tech to construct
1767680	1775280	and test arv or alien reproduction vehicles area 51 s4 has been discussed in ufology for decades
1775280	1780480	and is often immediately associated with the claims of bop lasar but what about edwards
1780480	1785520	are there any other stories of uap programs at the californian base that can support or detract
1785520	1791680	from ed's claims well for starters we can go all the way back to 1957 to the testimony of mercury
1791680	1796560	astronaut gordon cooper cooper claimed while stationed as a project manager at edwards air
1796560	1801200	force base a group of photographers assigned to photograph remote positions of the base
1801200	1806480	observed a large strange-looking craft above a lake bed cooper's crew began taking films of
1806480	1811360	the craft and according to cooper the craft was quote hovering above the ground and then it slowly
1811360	1816480	came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes end quote the camera crew estimated the
1816480	1822000	object to be about 30 feet in diameter shiny silver in color and featured three landing gear
1822000	1827120	the crew got within 20 yards of the craft before it departed cooper did in fact see the film but
1827200	1832160	stated the evidence was confiscated and this is a very brief summary of the story as i would love
1832160	1838640	to cover it further in great detail well that was i was found i was having some camera men found the
1838640	1845360	installation of a of a precision landing facility we were putting in right on the edge of the dry
1845360	1851600	lake and the saucer flew right over them and put down three little gear and landed out on the dry
1851600	1860160	lake bed and they went out to pick up their cameras and moved on out toward him filming
1861840	1867360	and he left it off put the gear back in the well and climbed out a very high rate of speed and
1867360	1874320	disappeared and so while i was going through all the regulation books and finding out the number
1874320	1882640	to call and watching to report it i had to go over and develop the film the time they got back
1882640	1889200	with the developed film i was on the higher and higher and higher level officer talking to me
1890480	1896880	finally with the colonel telling me to you know when the film arrived at my desk to put it in the
1896880	1902960	carrier pouch there would be a courier there at my office by that time already and they'd range for
1902960	1911680	him to fly in our base airplane back to washington with these films and uh do not run prints etc etc
1911680	1918960	etc so we stuck them in the courier pouch did you watch the film we didn't have a chance to run it i
1918960	1926000	had a chance to hold it up to the window and look at it it was certainly a good film good close-up
1926560	1933120	good close-up shot in 1972 we can find project outgrowth out of the usaf rocket propulsion
1933120	1938640	lab at edwards a document titled advanced propulsion concepts project outgrowth
1938640	1943600	sees discussion of an anti-gravity program and theoretical material to change the direction
1943600	1949680	and amplitude of gravitational fields similarly in 1988 a technical report submitted under
1949680	1954480	contract with the usaf aeronautics lab out of edwards discusses the exploration of the
1954480	1959200	bifield brown effect explored at length by jessie michaels which allegedly converts
1959200	1964960	electrostatic energy into propulsion around the same year 1988 defense contractor science
1964960	1970480	applications international corporation saic a defense contractor i have directly implicated
1970480	1975520	in the study of off-world technologies studied similar electronic propulsion mechanisms for
1975520	1981120	edwards air force base we can also look to 1990 where journalist scott williams wrote an article
1981120	1986240	in aviation week in which 45 sightings of aircraft accelerating from near hovering positions to
1986240	1991680	supersonic speeds were seen over edwards air force base george air force base in china lake
1991680	1997760	naval weapons center one such craft was described as triangular in shape but let's not forget the
1997760	2003760	1998 testimony of usaf master sergeant edgar foush i have covered numerous times who commented on the
2003760	2009600	infamous tr 3b reverse engineered triangular craft foush claimed while working at the defense
2009600	2015680	advanced research board in 1979 under the jet propulsion laboratory at edwards a full anti-gravity
2015680	2021360	propulsion system was developed and a secret space fleet utilized this technology if you haven't
2021360	2026800	yet please watch my video on locking martin as i discussed the foush case in much greater depth
2026800	2032000	including his station at the proposed defense advanced research center while discussing the tr
2032000	2037680	3b craft foush makes specific mention graduates from the 412th test pilot school at edwards
2037680	2043520	air force base pilot these reverse engineered craft many more enigmatic claims without direct
2043520	2048720	evidence exists surrounding edwards the infamous base was mentioned myriad times within lenard
2048720	2054160	stringfield's crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7 in ufo crash retrievals the inner
2054160	2060080	sanctum status report 6 stringfield makes mention of a doctor epigoni a pseudonym for a physicist
2060080	2066080	who claimed to have worked closely with oppenheimer einstein and teller epigoni stated in the late
2066080	2071520	60s early 70s he worked on something called project heaven a special projects at edwards
2071520	2076240	air force base the doctor claimed a flying saucer and its crew had previously landed
2076240	2081360	at edwards the craft was kept in a large hanger guarded tightly whilst occupants were carted off
2081360	2087680	to a secure building for evaluation the 12 five foot tall bodies clad in silvery metal suits featured
2087680	2094400	eyes of one color a nose a mouth teeth and blood similar to the appearance of oil to quote epigoni
2095200	2100400	they the u.s researchers came to the conclusion that since there was no deterioration to leave
2100400	2105120	them alone because another craft might come in the area and rejuvenate or reactivate them
2105120	2110960	end quote the craft itself had no rivets seams or welding and was of a classic saucer design with
2110960	2116880	a dome on top measuring 40 feet in diameter other scientists informed epigoni craft materials
2116880	2121520	were made of materials they never dreamed could exist and could not figure out a way to gain
2121520	2127440	entry to the craft epigoni stated as of 1990 project blue heaven was still active it was run
2127440	2133920	by the dod and the navy had two to three similar projects the doctor's account is far more detailed
2133920	2138400	and i promise we will circle back to this testimony in future projects but the landing of this craft
2138400	2143680	and seemingly inert bodies reminds me closely of the craft donation theory when you say crash
2143680	2150640	retrieval what do you make these are retrieving non-human origin uh technical vehicles you know
2150720	2157200	call it spacecraft if you will non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed
2157200	2166320	we have spacecraft from another species we do yeah how many quite a number you're kidding no the
2166320	2171040	strangest detail of this testimony is the claim the craft touched down the beans walked out of
2171040	2176400	the craft and laid on the ground it's worth noting and stringfield commented on this too
2176400	2182160	epigoni changed the body count from 12 to 4 according to stringfield and his fellow investigator
2182160	2187200	they quote agreed that it appeared that he had consulted with his superiors and was advised to
2187200	2193840	alter certain key details end quote also in 1991 status report six stringfield recounts his discussions
2193840	2200640	with a firsthand witness to a ufo crash retrieval 15 miles outside of edwards in 1971 according to
2200640	2205760	witness debbie clayton her and her girlfriend's family investigated a crash from the sky in broad
2205760	2211600	daylight reaching the craft site debbie observed an acorn-shaped craft with an extremely similar
2211600	2217600	description to the kexburg crash quote we searched for markings but found only some old scratches
2217600	2223200	that we could not read because it was upright we couldn't see the bottom there were no windows
2223200	2229440	or seams appearing to be made from a one-piece mold if i remember correctly it was a dark grayish
2229440	2235120	color with greenish highlights not a color one normally sees there was a mild heat coming from
2235120	2239840	the craft somewhat like a car engine after traveling for an hour one more thing i thought
2239840	2244960	was strange there was no dust that clung to the shell here in the desert dust is everywhere
2244960	2250240	and clings to everything end quote according to debbie an air force car and truck arrived within
2250240	2256320	14 minutes where men with rifles ordered civilians off scene lastly i want to cover an excerpt michael
2256320	2260640	schratt discovered in the files of the late stringfield which may allow us to directly connect
2260640	2268720	edwards to operating arv and ny craft alongside area 51 s4 in a letter dated april 5th 1980
2268720	2276080	one mr d l dobs discussed one mh a witness identity schratt chose not to disclose mh had
2276080	2282320	allegedly performed radio maintenance at the atomic proving ground in nevada during 1961 to 1963
2282320	2288160	along with top secret radio work for usaff according to mh he participated in a top secret
2288160	2294240	operation at area 51 titled project red light test flights were conducted on a recovered ufo
2294240	2299440	ship from none other than edwards air force base the craft was not conventionally powered
2299440	2304640	and stayed silent during operation security was so tight on the project program personnel were
2304640	2310800	rotated every six months mh claimed to have heard rumors of a west coast american defense contractor
2310800	2314800	encountering difficulties in many of the components comprising the craft
2320080	2324720	and lastly guys i want to cover a possible connection between reverse engineering programs
2324720	2332000	at edwards and nella slash area 51 in july of 1991 an alleged classified nr o document leaked to
2332000	2337440	the public this document informed need to know groups and operations about civilian flying
2337440	2342320	saucer organizations organizing protests in nevada steven greer claimed to have given the
2342320	2347760	document to admiral thomas wilson from the wilson davis memo which at the very least we can confirm
2347760	2353520	the meeting between greer and wilson allegedly wilson told greer he recognized one of the entities
2353520	2359760	listed and that it was run by a contractor addressed in this document includes royal ops cosmic ops
2359760	2367840	mage ops magi ops multiple usaf special forces divisions in the 26th 64th 65th 527th nella's
2367840	2374400	afos i groom lake and dreamland area 51 s4 aquatec and sea spray special operations group
2374400	2380400	and one blackjack team according to dr steven greer inside sources including a source inside
2380400	2387280	blackjack control told him of two entities blackjack control and blackjack team blackjack control is
2387280	2392320	allegedly a nella's based facility participating in reverse engineering while blackjack team
2392320	2397920	operates in conjunction with control but is stationed at edwards air force base so but the
2397920	2402800	key facilities i want to go through and there are others this is a list um that i've updated i
2402800	2410400	updated it um for the president in 09 um a very chief one is edwards air force base and there's
2410400	2418240	a whole constellation there haystack butte china lakes george air force base they retired norton
2418240	2426480	air force base tabletop mountain observatory which is run ostensibly by nasa and blackjack control
2426480	2432720	though i had a source at blackjack control associated with the edwards related facilities
2432720	2441440	but the blackjack team you saw on that list was nella's so there's blackjack control and blackjack
2441440	2447520	team i can find almost nothing publicly available to research on blackjack besides a late 2010s
2447520	2453120	early 2020s project between darpa the defense advanced research project and defense contractors
2453120	2458320	owned by raytheon project blackjack was quote intended to develop and demonstrate critical
2458320	2463440	elements of a global high-speed network in low earth orbit that satisfied dod performance and
2463440	2468400	payload requirements at a much lower cost with shorter design cycles and with easier and more
2468400	2474960	frequent technology upgrades and quote seen as the alleged nro document dates back to 1991 i doubt
2474960	2481680	these two blackjacks connect what's going on guys it's uap gerb and i'd like to thank each
2481680	2487200	and every single one of you for joining me today as we took a deep dive into ed's witness testimony
2487760	2493120	now i know i discussed this a multitude of times throughout today's video but i'd like to reiterate
2493120	2499920	today's thesis once more for a final time analyzing ed's credible witness testimony
2499920	2505840	conclusions can be drawn of a joint reverse engineering program focused on craft of non-human
2505840	2512000	intelligence existing between edwards air force base california and nella's air force base nevada
2512160	2519040	slash area 51 s4 this program stems out of the 412th test group comprising the edwards
2519040	2526080	usaf test pilot school and edwards 412th electronics warfare group now this research was
2526080	2530960	some of the most enticing exciting and interesting i have done since working on the off-world
2530960	2535760	technologies division and i would like to compare these two testimonies the off-world
2535760	2541440	technologies division and the technology here focused more on singular pieces of technology
2541440	2548480	and almost weapons as described by r.a. now it was interesting to see the juxtaposition between
2548480	2554320	this air force testimony as the air force plants in conjunction with a lockheed martin bowing and
2554320	2559440	possibly other contractors actually work on the piloting and utilization of reverse engineered
2559440	2565440	craft whether these craft are triangular in shape the classic tr 3b as proposed by fauche
2566080	2571920	or possibly the flux liner classic saucer shape as proposed by mark mcandalish that were housed at
2571920	2578160	allegedly housed at dormant air force base 1988 i'm not sure perhaps it's both but the line that
2578160	2583520	fauche states that these pilots put commanded the reverse engineer tr 3b is out of edwards air
2583520	2590400	force base pilot test uh test school jumped out to me after covering him so long ago in my lockheed
2590400	2596720	martin video this research was fascinating i wish we could find out a little more on ed's time at
2596720	2602080	the pentagon all we really have to go off there is the 34 billion dollars and then 40 billion
2602080	2608320	dollars missing in uh transfer of authorization funds off book funds this can possibly support
2608320	2612640	greers and other people's thesis that many of these programs are funded through black budget
2612640	2618800	operations i know that this uh program at at edwards edwards is a very populous base so
2618800	2624400	if this reverse engineering program is indeed real this must be kept to an exclusively small
2624400	2630240	number of personnel in an exclusively small area who knows perhaps edwards is connected to
2630240	2635120	underground facilities in this region i know greer likes to say that the uh anthill facility he
2635120	2640080	posted a picture of recently in the uh helendale facility are done location so possibly this is a
2640960	2646880	kind of a connected area in which craft are stored after hearing ed's testimony what do you guys
2646880	2652320	think i would like nothing more than to speak to ed firsthand and hear all this information
2652320	2659360	from himself but unfortunately he has gone off books there is no way to contact this individual
2659360	2666640	whether by phone social media or email and believe me i have tried so if greer is right and this
2666640	2673040	individual has tested revealed testified revealing information he knows this testimony is indeed
2673040	2677760	impactful beyond belief but has he or is that one of greer's embellishments we don't know
2677760	2682160	i'd like more than anything to see this individual ed before the senate intelligence
2682160	2686960	committee or at november's open hearings who knows maybe we'll be surprised to do so but
2686960	2691120	let me know what you guys think about this alleged reverse engineering program at uh
2691120	2696640	edwards air force base and nellis air force base area 51 again if anybody has any other further
2696640	2702000	research to let me know about this i would love to know i know that uh i drew a conclusion i decided
2702000	2707920	not to keep it in the video about the air force plant 42 near palm dale sightings of late and
2707920	2713440	edwards these two facilities are only about 30 miles apart which uh you know very interesting i
2713440	2718880	think edwards and norton are also only about 80 miles apart so this whole complex is deeply entwined
2718880	2724720	to both ufo sightings and testimonies of reverse engineering programs i was also thrilled to be
2724720	2729600	able to dive into the work of lennard stringfield and others to look at some more occasions i know
2729600	2734560	we uh researched the debbie clayton acorn-shaped craft 15 miles outside of edward that was
2734560	2741040	immediately swarmed by usaff crew within 15 minutes and the testimony of dr epigoni that
2741040	2745840	one is very interesting uh relating to the craft donation theory if you don't know what that is
2745840	2751920	certain individuals like david grush have discussed that some retrievals of uap are not
2751920	2757600	crash retrievals these craft are just found left unattended this story reminded closely of the
2757600	2763520	alleged 1957 hollamann air force base landing in which a flying saucer saucer touched down at
2763520	2768560	hollamann air force base and occupants walked out of the craft to interact with usaff personnel
2768560	2773440	in epigoni's case these beings walked out of the craft to lay down on the ground and seemingly
2773440	2780080	turned themselves off which could possibly attest to the the theory of biological robots
2780080	2784800	essentially as many people like to call the grays there will be further research that needs to be
2784800	2791920	done on blackjack team and blackjack control this just rang a note in my head from that 1991
2791920	2797360	alleged nro document but more research needs to be done here thus far i can find no connections
2797360	2806480	between darpa really but this to me is the jumping off point of researching usaff legacy and contractor
2806480	2811600	reverse engineering programs possibly housed at contractor sites possibly housed at air force
2811680	2816640	base locations so let me know what you guys think i really appreciate everybody joining me today
2817280	2822320	please remember to like and subscribe uh share these videos around i got a patreon if you want to
2822320	2827440	join i don't charge for any extra content i don't gate keep content all of my research is free for
2827440	2832160	anybody to consume i only have the patreon if you want to support what you think the channel's worth
2832160	2838320	but guys i have some awesome upcoming other projects on arvs or alien reproduction vehicles
2838320	2843120	including a deep dive on mark mcandalish which i hope to do soon i know that's been highly requested
2843120	2848560	and i cannot wait to do so so without further ado guys i want to thank you all again for joining me
2848560	2853040	and very soon we'll be back up with another show so thank you very much guys and i'll catch you all
