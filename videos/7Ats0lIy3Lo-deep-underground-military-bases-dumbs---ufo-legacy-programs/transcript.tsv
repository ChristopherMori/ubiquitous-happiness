0	6560	When discussing UFO legacy programs, I aim to expose any clandestine black-budget U.S.
6560	11840	government military intelligence operation, partnering with defense contractors, federally
11840	16880	funded research and development centers, and university-affiliated research centers engaging
16880	23520	with non-human technology. These programs seem to take many forms, including crash recovery of
23920	29520	non-human vehicles, material exploitation of technologies of unknown origin, reverse
29520	35520	engineering of anomalous craft, and construction of copycat vehicles famously known as alien
35520	41840	reproduction vehicles, ARVs. On this channel, we have discussed myriad major range and test
41840	47280	facility bases and defense laboratories and centers where such programs are likely located.
47280	53520	We have also discussed at length contractors, FFRDCs, and UARCs that are alleged to operate
53520	61520	alongside the CIA and NSA across Army, Navy, and Air Force UFO programs. When such clandestine and
61520	67120	secretive operations to master non-human technology have led to, in David Grush's words,
67120	72880	a multi-decade secret Cold War, where might these programs be located? The logistics of
72880	79040	maintaining secrecy and strict need to know access for unacknowledged special access programs focused
79040	84560	on anomalous research, development, test, and evaluation of non-human technologies and storage
84560	91760	of non-human craft and possibly biologics are likely tremendous. For this reason, we must look
91760	98240	underground and evaluate the decades of rumors and testimonies of UFOs and deep underground
98240	104080	military bases, or DUMMS. DUMMS have served as a continuous focus of this channel with recent
104080	110000	discussion and direct investigation into dugway-proving ground. The United States premier chemical
110000	116320	and biological testing range and its alleged 1,300 square mile subterranean facility and
116320	122320	remote entrance in the desert. For this investigation, we will be continuously referencing the work of
122400	128400	Dr. Richard Sotter and his three masterpieces titled Underground Bases and Tunnels, What is the
128400	134320	Government Trying to Hide? Hidden in Plain Site Beyond the X-Files and Underground and Underwater
134320	140400	Bases. These three dense pieces give us keen context into subterranean bases in the form of
140400	146160	stringent fact-based analysis through publicly available records, FOIA documents, declassified
146160	152720	documents, and the occasional witness testimony. Deep underground military bases do indeed exist.
152720	159520	This is fact and we will explore this fact today, but do these sites engage with UFO legacy programs?
159520	166480	And if so, which DoD sites and what do they do? And could the decades of rumors regarding underground
166480	172560	tunnels connecting these clandestine sites through an internal rail system possibly be true?
172640	177520	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so very much for joining me today as we embark into the
177520	184240	world of the subterranean to investigate DUMs and UFOs. The subject of UFO legacy sites embedded
184240	189120	into mountains with hidden hangars sequestered a mile beneath the Earth's surface or hidden
189120	193840	anywhere out of the public and satellite view has long been a talking point of this channel
193840	199840	in my investigations. Today, we finally look below the Earth's surface to evaluate the existence,
199840	206080	feasibility, and operations of UFO legacy programs and deep underground military bases.
211200	216800	To borrow from the title of the first chapter of Dr. Richard Sotter's Underground Bases and Tunnels,
216800	222560	deep underground military bases are indeed real. Throughout this project, I will be interchangeably
222560	229280	using the terms DUM and subterranean facility or stiff. The name said to me by multiple veterans
229280	235440	who have traveled to such underground locations. And speaking of, I should mention, I have spoken
235440	240800	to nearly half a dozen former military personnel who have traveled to stiffs across the country.
240800	246160	I try to shy away from inserting first hand source testimony and anecdotes into my videos and let
246160	251360	evidence and research speak for itself, so I will interject with these first hand testimonies when
251360	258160	and if necessary. In a 1989 speech titled Underground Facilities for Defense, Experience
258160	263600	and Lessons, Deputy Director of Engineering and Construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
263600	269520	Lloyd A. Dusha said, quote, After World War II, political and economic factors changed the
269520	275440	underground construction picture and caused a renewed interest to think underground. As a result
275440	280320	of this interest, the Corps of Engineers became involved in the design and construction of some
280320	286240	very complex and interesting military projects, end quote. In the same talk, Dusha would then go
286240	291520	on to exclaim, quote, Although the conference program indicates the topic to be underground
291520	297280	facilities for defense, experience and lessons, I must deviate a little because several of the
297280	302800	most interesting facilities that have been designed and constructed by the Corps are still classified,
302800	308800	end quote. Acknowledged military subterranean facilities do indeed exist. Publicly known sites
308800	314720	include the Norad Cheyenne Mountain Complex buried deep under Colorado Springs. This enormous
314800	320160	installation built to monitor North American missile threats sits 2,000 feet underground
320160	327680	and spans 5.1 acres, featuring six three-story high and 40 foot wide tunnels and 15 three-story
327680	333120	buildings made of steel plates. And these are just the acknowledged portions of the base.
333120	339920	Additionally, the Raven Rock Complex, aka Site R, serves as a secure underground command center or
339920	345600	backup Pentagon and is shrouded in mystery. This site under Fort Detrick, Maryland includes
345600	351520	accommodations for 3,000 people, has an inbuilt medical and dental clinic, fire department,
351520	357280	post office and five acknowledged three-story buildings. The secrets Raven Rock must hold
357280	362960	are endless, but existing acknowledged dumps are not the focus of today's investigation.
362960	368560	Instead, we plan to pursue dumps that operate as UFO legacy program locations and explore the
368640	374560	feasibility of decades of rumors of hundreds, if not thousands of miles of underground tunnels
374560	381120	and railroads connecting deep underground UFO legacy operations. To once again quote, U.S. Army
381120	386720	Corps of Engineers Deputy Director for Engineering and Construction Lloyd A. Dusha, when speaking
386720	391760	about the Corps' involvement in the 1960s construction of the Cheyenne site, quote.
391760	396800	As stated earlier, there are other projects of similar scope, which I cannot identify,
396800	401680	but which include multiple chambers up to 50 feet wide and 100 feet high,
401680	406720	using the same excavation procedure mentioned for the NORAD facility, end quote.
406720	411520	After all, according to a 1985 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report titled
411520	416800	Literature Survey of Underground Construction Methods for Application to Harden Facilities,
416800	421280	STIFs can be built anywhere with the right amount of money and in myriad types of
421280	426560	structures utilizing deep shaft structures and facilities tunneled into mountain sides.
426560	431520	The report even states, quote, since adequate technology is available to construct hardened
431520	436320	underground facilities under virtually any ground conditions, the main constraint in
436320	441840	construction projects remains economic viability rather than technical feasibility, end quote.
441840	447520	As we know from David Grush and multiple other sources and testimonies, UFO legacy programs
447520	453680	operate on the U.S. Black budget. Untraceable, deep-sixed money and contracts buried within
453760	458640	special access, controlled access and unacknowledged special access programs.
458640	464320	From the excellent work of Catherine Austin Fitz, I mention often, we also know that as much as $21
464320	471280	trillion in unauthorized spending has occurred between 1998 and 2015. And this is just within
471280	476400	the DOD and Department of Housing and Urban Development, much of which Fitz believed was
476400	482320	designated for clandestine military R&D. Publicly denied UFO, research development,
482320	488560	test and evaluation underground locations would absolutely classify as such. Dumbs for clandestine
488560	494320	and unacknowledged use is also a practice very much currently in play. One such example is
494320	499920	Warrenton U.S. Army Training Center located in the northern Virginia town of Warrenton. The book
499920	505440	The Secret Team, the CIA and its allies in control of the world by Fletcher Prouty, identified a
505440	510640	highly secretive underground installation that serves as a federal relocation center by an
510640	517280	unknown agency. This was confirmed in an inquiry magazine article titled Going Underground by
517280	522880	Robert Walters, which plainly states that U.S. Army Warrenton Training Center is a CIA covert
522880	528240	facility. Additionally, there is the highly secretive U.S. Navy underground facility in the
528240	534320	mountains of West Virginia near Sugar Grove. This location is an underground site run by the Navy
534320	541200	for the National Security Agency, so the NSA and CIA already have a traceable interest in using U.S.
541200	547680	military bases underground facilities as a cover for unknown usage in operations. So before discussing
547680	552960	much of the testimony of UFOs and Dumbs, let's quickly touch on the reality and history of these
552960	563040	impressive, often unacknowledged sites. The inception of Dumbs in the United States can
563040	568240	actually be traced back to the Nazis, an operation paperclip, the famous program to recruit
568240	574000	Nazi scientists, engineers, and technicians into U.S. government employment. Near the end of World
574000	580400	War II, the Nazis had begun utilization of what we might call Dumbs. In the book Lucky Forward,
580400	585680	The History of Patent's Third Army, Colonel Robert S. Allen detailed Allied discoveries of
585680	591920	Nazi underground bases, quote, the underground installations were amazing. They were literally
592000	599120	subterranean towns. There were four in and around Ordruf. None were natural caverns or mines. All
599120	605120	were man-made military installations. The horror camp had provided the labor. An interesting feature
605120	610560	of the construction was the absence of any spoil. It had been carefully scattered into hills miles
610560	616800	away, end quote. Some Nazi installations were over 50 feet underground, comprised of several
616880	622960	miles of two to three story facilities. The sites were arranged like wheels with spokes designed
622960	629360	with reinforced concrete. The Nazis designed such locations as Ordruf to house Nazi high command
629360	634640	after the bombing of Berlin, but never got the chance to populate the facility. We additionally
634640	641040	have the Regenwurm Lager, or Earthworm Camp in Poland. This Nazi sprawling underground complex
641120	647360	beneath West Poland's full extent is still unknown today. The site featured miles of underground
647360	652240	tunnels and electrical train lines connecting bunkers, fortifications, and other critical
652240	657920	military facilities. This sounds familiar, no? Two declassified documents can be discovered
657920	664240	dating back to 1947 regarding the aforementioned Operation Paperclip. Featured in the documents
664240	670400	are requests by Air Material Command for a quote unquote requirement of four German technicians
670400	676320	to consult on a planned underground plant program. One man named was Xavier Dorsch,
676320	682160	director of the TOT organization in the closing of World War Two. This was the Nazi's equivalent
682160	688240	of the US Navy Seabees, or US Army Corps of Engineers, but not part of formal German military
688240	693680	structure. The founder of this organization, Fritz Tott, designed the famous German Autobahn
693680	698960	Highway System. Towards the tail end of World War Two, Dorsch had helped with developing a series
698960	704800	of massive underground industrial manufacturing facilities to hide from Allied bombing raids.
704800	709920	It is indeed quite possible he also aided on the Regenwurm Lager and Ordruf.
709920	715680	Documents and research show Dorsch once briefed the Americans after he was captured in 1945 and
715680	722480	again in 1949, we do not know the full extent to which he aided in these programs. These massive
722480	727200	Nazi underground industrial manufacturing facilities possibly give us our first look
727200	733200	into UFO legacy programs and dums. I have covered on this channel the 1933 Magenta,
733200	739040	Italy UFO crash retrieval, a case whose validity is strongly supported by David Grush.
739040	747040	You said it's a 90 year cover up. Just about, yeah. 90 years. 1933 was the first recovery in
747040	754000	Europe in Magenta, Italy. They recovered a partially intact vehicle. In this case,
754000	760240	the Nazis purportedly took control of a crashed lenticular disk from the Italians in 1943 before
760240	766240	being recovered by the Americans post war. Hans Kamler was a Nazi engineer behind construction
766240	772560	of numerous concentration camps, including Auschwitz and led myriad Nazi secret weapons projects.
772560	777600	Kamler would have indeed been one of chief scientists and engineers to study a recovered
777600	782960	lenticular craft due to his unrivaled command over Nazi secret weapons programs.
783040	787680	Kamler went missing near the tail end of World War Two. However, documents prove rather
787680	794000	convincingly this evil engineer was taken alive into US custody. Albert Speer, Nazi and Reich
794000	799920	Minister of Armaments and War Production claimed in April 1945, Kamler informed him he had business
799920	806320	to offer the Americans. OSS agent Donald W. Richardson seemingly confirmed this by stating
806320	811840	70 years after he still couldn't fully speak on interrogating Kamler. But the Nazis had
811840	816880	brought treasure to the US that, quote, served the development of armament platforms for the Cold
816880	822480	War and for the future, end quote. Under Kamler's command, numerous underground tunnels and bases
822480	827680	existed, employing German companies to develop and build parts for advanced aircraft and secret
827680	832800	weapons programs. Kamler is even said to have stashed treasures and documents regarding his
832800	838560	think tanks top secret documents in a facility underground in the woods of Czechoslovakia.
838560	844400	According to Hidden Nazi by Dan Ruder, 44 years after Operation Hidden documents to retrieve
844400	849760	these stashed top secret documents, an American team from Lawrence Livermore Labs and Los Alamos
849760	856000	Labs to FFRDCs went to a new underground cavern that had not been emptied at the end of World
856000	860800	War Two called Mednick Hill. What was found here was, quote, the key to what was hidden at the
860800	866720	previous site, end quote. It goes without saying it stands to reason Kamler conducted early iterations
866720	872560	of UFO legacy programs underneath Mednick Hill, as well as his numerous underground locations and
872560	878960	tunnels, and that Xavier Dorsch was a key engineer in constructing these facilities. With Dorsch being
878960	884720	requested by air material command and Kamler being more than likely secretly smuggled by the Americans,
884720	892080	these two men could very well be the key architects of modern day US UFO and dumb legacy programs.
892080	896880	I am no expert in history, so to learn more about Kamler, I strongly recommend watching
896880	902960	the documentary The Two Lives of Hans Kamler. Later in this project, we will see even more ties
902960	908960	between Nazi Germany, Dumbs, and Paperclip than in the form of Maglev train systems.
914480	920160	On numerous occasions in the 1950s, the United States proposed massive underground facilities
920160	925600	that seemingly disappeared from public light. It is unknown if many of these facilities were
925600	932480	built or not. One example can be traced to 1957 to Green Mountain outside Huntsville, Alabama.
932480	938240	Huntsville is deeply enshrouded in US anti-gravity research, but we are looking elsewhere.
938240	944000	Two articles in 1957 reported the US Army was planning to build a rocket factory inside of
944000	948880	Green Mountain. The plan was proposed by the American Machine and Foundry Company, Redstone
948880	955280	Arsenal, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This location was slated to have a sort of subterranean
955280	959840	junior Pentagon, where elaborate headquarters would be installed to direct the defense of the
959840	965920	southern US from enemy attack. Again, it is unknown if this location was ever built. However,
965920	971840	such discussion of a junior Pentagon illustrated early private military cooperation, a theme we
971840	977680	will touch on much more much later. Analysis of US military and underground studies additionally
977680	983840	allows us valuable insights into DUMMS. Take the RAND Corporation for example. An FFRDC I have
983840	990400	spoken about ad nauseam is a primary semi-government institution up to its eyeballs in UFO legacy
990400	997360	programs. RAND Corporation was established in 1948 and grew out of Army Air Force Project RAND in
997360	1004000	1946. Project RAND sought to carry out long-range research projects of interest to the Air Force.
1004000	1009760	In the 1950s, USAF and RAND began working on the question of underground-based construction and
1009760	1016240	organized various symposiums. Let's analyze a resulting 1959 publication, Deep Underground
1016240	1020960	Construction. The purpose of such a symposium, according to the chairman, was to discuss,
1020960	1025920	quote, the problems of protecting military installations located deep underground or
1025920	1030800	under mountains, end quote, in the event of nuclear war. The chairman also stated,
1030800	1036560	since 1957, the RAND corp had been, quote, actively investigating the need for a small
1036560	1043280	number of super hard, deep underground centers, end quote. Additionally, in 1960, RAND published
1043280	1049680	a study under USAF contract dealing 12 locations for underground sites. All sites were assumed to
1049680	1057200	be more than 1000 feet deep. Of specific interest here is site three in Santa Barbara, California.
1057200	1062960	Santa Barbara is located just over 100 miles from the Antelope Valley, California. We will discuss
1062960	1069760	later. Research suggests a major network of UFO-focused stiff facilities exists interconnected
1069760	1075840	under the antelope. Site three is also located less than 100 miles away from Los Angeles,
1075840	1081680	where a tremendous amount of DoD research development tests and evaluation laboratories lie.
1081680	1087360	We have already mentioned the US Army Corps of Engineer giving in 1989 a quite frank admission
1087360	1093840	of classified underground facilities. An outside of the 1987 US Army Corps of Engineer report detailing
1093840	1100800	construction of Dumbs boils down to cost. In 1959 to 1961, the Army Corps of Engineer published a
1100800	1107280	five-part training manual titled, Design of Underground Installations in Rock. This startling
1107280	1112240	series assumes the pre-existence of underground facilities. The report states, quote,
1112240	1117600	vital government installations have been placed underground as exemplified by the Richie Project,
1117600	1123200	end quote. Many of these facilities were designed as command and control centers and survival bunkers
1123200	1129440	for nuclear attacks. These are known as continuity of government sites. Raven Rock qualifies as one
1129440	1135920	such continuity of government or COG DUM. Design of underground installations in rock additionally
1135920	1142320	makes some statements of extreme relevance to the testimonies of Dumbs and UFOs. Some installations
1142320	1147040	listed by the Army were to be shallow, while, quote, more important equipment and facilities
1147040	1152880	essential to defense may be installed in deeper workings that are likely to be long and tunnel-like,
1152880	1159280	occupying one or several stories, end quote. The report detailed enormous underground facilities
1159280	1165360	featuring 50 by 50 feet tunnels and chambers as much as 100 feet high, even stating, quote,
1165360	1170720	truck or rail traffic might be important, end quote. The Army even cautioned, quote,
1170720	1177840	landscape scars, roads and portal structures, aka entrances, should be as inconspicuous as possible.
1177840	1183120	Camouflage should be considered, end quote. This is of extreme consequence when discussing
1183120	1188720	testimonies such as MS, who detailed the entrance to the Dugway Stiff as a small building in the
1188720	1194960	middle of nowhere. In 1963, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a manual titled,
1195040	1200640	Utilization of Nuclear Power Plants in Underground Installations. This manual discussed
1200640	1205680	self-contained nuclear-powered underground facilities with button-up diesel secondary
1205680	1213040	systems. Critically, in 1964, the Army Corps of Engineers or COE proposed 12 massive structures
1213040	1219840	to be built up to 4,000 feet underground. There are two sites here of massive importance to our
1219840	1226320	investigation, one facility below Yuma County, Arizona, to be accessed via a vertical or incline
1226320	1232080	shaft. Such entry points are common amongst claims of UFO dum, such as the Dugway Dumb,
1232080	1237840	whose entrance is purported to be a vertical elevator shaft. In Stephen Greer's DPI archive,
1237840	1242000	who fans of this channel will know I have extracted a tremendous amount of information
1242000	1247280	and worthwhile investigation from, witness 10773 statement reads, quote,
1247280	1254080	nose of massive research and storage facility, material of unknown origin at Yuma Proving Ground,
1254080	1259760	end quote, fascinating connection here. Yuma Test Center is also home to Yuma Proving Ground,
1259760	1265760	a U.S. Army major range and test facility base, similar to Dugway Proving Ground's Army MRTFB,
1265760	1271920	the West Desert Test Center. Yuma Proving Ground is also run by Army Test and Evaluation Command.
1271920	1277520	Indeed, it is no stretch to assume if a stiff exists under one of these Army MRTFBs,
1277520	1281200	an equally impressive facility likely exists below the other.
1281200	1287280	Second here is Site III in Inyo County, California, to be accessed via incline shaft.
1287280	1293200	Inyo County resides on the inside boundary of China Lake Naval Weapons Testing Facility.
1293200	1298240	China Lake is one of the Navy's premier major range and test facility base and a location
1298240	1303600	spoken of on myriad occasions as an underground legacy program location.
1303600	1308240	China Lake really needs no introduction, but stay tuned as we will discuss China Lake
1308240	1313840	in much more detail along with Antelope Valley. But quickly to mention, Dr. Richard Sotter
1313840	1318720	received testimony from a Navy contact who served at China Lake. The witness confirmed
1318720	1324240	an impressively large and deep installation, claiming the facility extends one mile deep
1324240	1329120	and contains, quote, weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons, end quote.
1329120	1336080	Alongside the US Army's COE, the US Navy is also deeply entwined with underground and possibly
1336080	1341840	undersea bases, but that's another story for another day. In 1972, Naval Facilities
1341840	1346880	Engineering Command issued a report titled, Sub-Surface Deployment of Naval Facilities,
1346880	1351600	discussing several Navy installations to be placed underground. These include
1351600	1357680	administration, medical, aircraft maintenance, ammo storage, and miscellaneous storage facilities.
1357680	1362320	The US Navy Seabees additionally maintain underground installations between the
1362320	1368000	Presidential Camp David and CIA facility Camp Peary, which we will discuss later on.
1368000	1373360	In 1947, US Air Material Command requested Nazi technicians for construction of
1373360	1379200	underground facilities. In 1989, Lloyd Dusha admitted numerous underground installations
1379200	1386080	existed and were classified. This means stiffs of interest were built from 1947 to 1949,
1386080	1391840	a 42-year period. We can also assume some facilities were built before 1961 where the
1391840	1396800	five-part Army-COE document assumes the existence of such facilities.
1396800	1403040	One such example here may be Groom Lake Area 51 that was built in the 50s on the site of a former
1403040	1409360	Boron mine. After all, a 1991 DARPA report details secret cavities may be found in
1409360	1415200	conjunction with underground mines. However, due to the existence of literature on described future
1415200	1423200	plans for massive bases post-1961 that really hold our interest, we can assume from 1961 to 1989
1423200	1426400	the majority of our stiffs of interest were constructed.
1426800	1437760	Dumbs are not a new subject to the study of UFOs or my channel. I myself have talked a tremendous
1437760	1443520	amount of the alleged DARSE Defense Advanced Research Center, a 10-story underground location
1443520	1449360	built under Area 51 relayed by USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet that dealt with alien
1449360	1455680	reproduction vehicles, including the TR-3B. I have also spoken on the enigmatic Northrop
1455680	1462720	Tahan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities that have since at least 1987
1462720	1468480	been accused by excellent researchers such as Bill Hamilton as housing UFO legacy programs,
1468480	1472960	and don't worry, we will touch on these facilities in much more detail later.
1472960	1479520	Quite recently, I've discussed the Dugway Dumb as relayed by Witness MS and even provided images
1479520	1485360	and details of the exact alleged entrance to the facility, which exists as an elevator shaft
1485360	1490720	concealed by a tiny building in the middle of nowhere Dugway near German village.
1490720	1496560	As strange as that might seem, a 1991 paper issued by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research
1496560	1501760	Project Agency and US Army Missile Command titled Development of Inspection and Detection
1501760	1507520	Techniques for Hidden Cavities. This document served to train field nuclear weapons inspectors to
1507520	1514320	identify underground clandestine test complexes in developing nuclear nations. The report plainly
1514320	1519840	states buildings of various size can provide cover for shafts or other openings to a secret
1519840	1526000	underground cavity, sounds similar to MS, no? And lastly, I have relayed the testimony of Randy
1526000	1531280	Anderson in the underground facility under the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane housing the
1531280	1537440	alleged Off-World Technologies Division. The subject of underground UFO legacy programs rose
1537440	1543680	to prominence in 1989 with the claims of Bob Lazar and reverse engineering under Site 4,
1543680	1550400	as well as the Dulce base fiasco where starting in 1979, Paul Benowitz was fed disinformation
1550400	1556640	of a joint human extraterrestrial base under Dulce, New Mexico. Both S4 and Dulce are worthy
1556640	1562400	of further investigation. In fact, I believe S4 to be a very real location, but due to the
1562400	1567200	controversy around these accounts, discussions of these sites will be largely omitted from today's
1567200	1573920	discussions. The first true mention of DUMs and UFOs I can find is from Look Magazine in an article
1573920	1581200	titled Is This The Real Flying Saucer? dated 1955. The article discussed a Canadian company
1581200	1586080	constructing a flying saucer while also depicting a facility built underneath a hill with a
1586080	1592240	vertical shaft to the surface allowing the departure of flying saucers. Further rumors of UFOs and
1592240	1598400	DUMs wouldn't really arise until the 1970s, so this article is indeed intriguing. Leonard
1598400	1605360	Stringfield's UFO crash retrieval Status Reports 1-7 is a body of work I often praise extensively.
1605360	1611040	After all, Stringfield is in my opinion one of the greatest UFO investigators of all time.
1611040	1617120	His work on UFO retrieval incidents and operations spanned from 1978 to 1994 and
1617120	1622080	relays some of the earliest mentions I can find of deep underground legacy operations.
1622080	1627040	Let's briefly explore a few. One such intriguing report is an anonymous letter
1627040	1633840	Stringfield received 12 February 1974. The letter highlighted secret research on UFOs
1633840	1640160	taking place at a secret underground complex below Gray Army Airfield and Fort Hood, Texas.
1640160	1645760	According to the witness, the complex is shared with ICBM silos built into a small mountain.
1645760	1650720	This is fascinating as later in the project we will discuss how numerous DUMs were constructed
1650720	1656800	primarily as ICBM sites. The witness described a section of the mountain would open up onto a
1656800	1662240	jet interceptor runway, which was once accidentally observed by a private pilot making a forced
1662240	1667280	landing over this restricted air corridor. This underground facility, according to the witness,
1667280	1672080	was tied with NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
1672160	1677520	Ohio, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, and others.
1678080	1683200	And this is where the anonymous account gets very interesting. The witness stated the complex
1683200	1688480	employed a squadron of unmarked helicopters dispatched quote when the need arises and quote
1688480	1694560	codenamed the blue boys. This sounds incredibly similar to UFO recovery rapid reaction units
1694560	1700080	I have spoken about in numerous crash retrieval cases such as the Blue Berets in the 1965
1700160	1705040	Kecksburg, Pennsylvania case. The choppers additionally carried a new type of missile the
1705040	1710400	source had been informed had been used on UFOs but a new system had been in development which
1710400	1716800	would be far more efficient. This was an electronic warfare system designed to disable UFOs under
1716800	1723040	quote unquote controlled conditions. This letter would arrive to Stringfield's desk in 1974 but
1723040	1727920	now in 2025 we have heard the whistleblower testimony of Jake Barber where he discussed
1727920	1735760	EMP type weapons designed to bring down UFOs over the enigmatic range. In your time in deployment
1735760	1741040	you met certain people from an aerospace company, didn't you? Yes I did. Now it's also part of the
1741040	1745760	constraints you operate under that you can't name that aerospace company. There's no good reason to
1745760	1750960	name them even if I wasn't constrained. What were they doing there? Well they were supporting us with
1750960	1761440	some new weapons technology that could be used to disable vehicles and aircraft. I can disclose
1761440	1765600	this my understanding is that they were essentially using it was actually I think it's a matter of
1765600	1770880	public record that microwave weapons pulse microwave weapons were being used at that time.
1770880	1777200	Correct there were some early prototypes that were being used at that time and I met individuals
1777200	1781760	that were there representing the companies that were providing that service to the government,
1781760	1787040	made some friends and those relationships led to opportunities later in the California desert
1787600	1792160	where I began my journey. Leonard would actually see a volume of reports regarding
1792160	1798320	underground complexes at Fort Hood including a USAF Lieutenant Colonel who relate to him in 1975
1798320	1804400	of an underground project that took place at Fort Hood. In 1976 Stringfield met an individual
1804480	1810080	from McGregor Texas who claimed his father had worked beneath Fort Hood on the UFO program.
1810080	1814880	This second-hand witness relayed a quote from his father stating quote the technology that is being
1814880	1819680	applied in this underground complex would remind someone of a science fiction thriller. It is
1819680	1826400	unbelievable what they know and what they can do from this area. Spanning the late 70s into the 80s
1826400	1831120	Stringfield received myriad reports of an underground facility beneath Wright Patterson
1831120	1836880	Air Force Base housing preserved non-human biologics. One such account was relayed from
1836880	1843680	witness JK who worked at a Nike missile site in Wilmington, Ohio. JK claimed to have seen nine
1843680	1851520	alien bodies under Wright Pad in 1966 encased in glass frozen to preserve. JK also claimed
1851520	1856960	recovered craft were housed at McDill Air Force Base Langley Air Force Base in Seymour Johnson
1856960	1863520	Navy Training Center outside of Norfolk, Virginia. These locations purportedly all housed craft and
1863520	1869600	sometimes biologics and underground hangers to conceal material from military and politicians.
1869600	1874320	Stringfield heard similar accounts of biologics under Wright Pat relayed second hand from one
1874320	1880720	TS who allegedly witnessed bodies in the early 1950s. TS were amongst a handful that relayed
1880720	1886480	such stories. Leonard Stringfield would also once receive an anonymous undated letter from a
1886480	1891920	U.S. airman who is stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The source relayed rumors and
1891920	1898640	stories of UFOs being stored in the Manzano storage area in remote Kirtland. Remember if you will,
1898640	1904640	Kirtland is home to Sandia National Labs, FFRDC, which ranging from the interplanetary
1904640	1910240	phenomenon unit report to accusations of reverse engineering a propulsion device for the TR-3B
1910240	1916560	by Edgar Fouchet has stood as a high probability candidate in UFO RDT&E programs.
1916560	1922400	Manzano Mountain Underground Facility is no myth either. While researching for his 2001 book
1922400	1927760	Underwater and Underground Bases, solder received FOIA documents of two underground
1927760	1932960	facilities below Manzano. While these documents of course say nothing about UFO storage,
1932960	1937680	it is fascinating to see solder confirm the rumors of an underground installation beneath
1937680	1943280	Kirtland. Lastly, I want to reference an anonymous letter to Leonard Stringfield I have covered before.
1943280	1949360	This is dated March 14, 1975, which claims to recount the testimony of one Lieutenant Colonel
1949360	1955840	Sims, Asunim. I previously discussed this letter in reference to the project on ED. An Edwards
1955840	1961680	Air Force Base 412th Test Group Electronic Warfare Test Director who claimed to the existence of a
1961760	1967680	joint UFO reverse engineering program operating between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada
1967680	1973040	Test and Training Range. Viewers of this channel will know I consider ED to be one of the most
1973040	1978960	critical UFO legacy witnesses of all time and as a quick side note, ED also referenced attending
1978960	1984400	the S-4 site. This letter was referenced due to the mention of Handscom Air Force Base in the
1984400	1991120	Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An Air Base and University where ED worked from 2002 to 2005
1991120	1997520	on foreign military assets. Amongst the intriguing mentions of contractors, FFRDCs,
1997520	2003040	UARCs, and air bases involved in UFO research and investigation, the source relayed Lieutenant
2003040	2008160	Colonel Sims speaking of several computer banks hidden within underground installations scattered
2008160	2013280	across the US, housing sophisticated computer equipment, electronic instrumentation, and
2013280	2018320	mobile radar units. According to Sims, these underground installations employ, quote,
2018320	2023120	squadrons of unmarked helicopters which have sophisticated instrumentation on board that
2023120	2029200	are dispatched to areas of UFO activity to monitor these craft or airlift them out of the area if
2029200	2034960	one has malfunctioned, end quote. This sounds quite similar to the Blue Boy's rapid reaction unit
2034960	2040000	related to Stringfield, does it not? But perhaps we have other confirming evidence so let's also
2040000	2045200	reference the book Trinity's Children Living Along America's Nuclear Highways. The authors
2045200	2050880	of this book state, quote, there are more crazed supercomputers in New Mexico, an Air Force computer
2050880	2056080	expert once said than anywhere else. They're here at the Weapon Center referring to Kirtland,
2056080	2060560	they're across the street at Sandia, they're at Los Alamos up the highway, and they're at the,
2060560	2066320	quote, underground places nobody knows about. Intriguing as we already know Kirtland and by
2066320	2073360	extension Sandia employ at least two underground facilities in the Manzano Mountains. Los Alamos
2073360	2079040	National Labs additionally employs a deep underground installation. Dr. Sotter had quite
2079040	2083600	an interesting engagement with Los Alamos. He repeatedly attempted to FOIA the Department
2083600	2088480	of Energy for information on underground facilities and tunnels beneath Los Alamos.
2088480	2094480	The DOE continuously responded there were none. Eventually though, the DOE provided Sotter a
2094480	2101920	badly blurred phototastic copy of an article by Earl Zimmerman titled, LASL's Unusual Underground
2101920	2108320	Lab, which described an underground facility built in the late 1940s. This article was undated
2108320	2114480	and of uncertain origin, however Zimmerman can be found labeled as a press bureau member from 1963
2114480	2122000	to 1965 in a 2020 Los Alamos organizational chart. Dr. Sotter additionally met with a businessman
2122000	2127280	who relayed his experience in visiting Los Alamos in the company of a highly clear associate.
2127280	2131440	The businessman was privy to wherever his esteemed colleague went without question,
2131440	2137440	the individual claimed 75% of Los Alamos's facilities are underground and extend as far
2137440	2148880	as one mile underground. In relation to TUOs and UFOs, so far we have covered very real
2148880	2154880	stiffs under Kirtland slash Sandia and Los Alamos while also discussing the possible existence of
2154880	2161440	facilities existing under Wright Patterson, Fort Hood slash Gray Army airfield Yuma County,
2161440	2166480	China Lake as well as the Nevada test site under the Nevada test and training range.
2166480	2173040	Now onto one of the most critical areas of my research, the Antelope Valley, California.
2173040	2178320	For this section, we will reference the work of both Dr. Sotter as well as the late Bill Hamilton,
2178320	2183600	a tremendous UFO researcher. Hamilton served as a true pioneer of the field,
2183600	2188880	serving as the first researcher to ever produce the term and a public image of ARV,
2188880	2195040	and even handed incredible witnesses such as Mark McCandlish and Bill Uhouse to Stephen Greer.
2195040	2201920	Hamilton's excellent book, Cosmic Top Secret, an ultra rare early 1990s lecture recorded for VHS
2201920	2207840	titled UFOs and Underground Bases, offers us keen insights into Hamilton's research on
2207840	2213840	Dumbs and specific area of interest, the Antelope Valley. In fact, Hamilton produced a map
2213840	2219440	related to him by sources of connected underground UFO facilities in the American Southwest.
2219440	2225200	We will compare this map to existing DoD laboratories and RDT and E locations later
2225200	2231200	on in this video. China Lake Naval Air Station is also quite close to Antelope Valley, so we will
2231200	2237760	discuss that enigmatic facility here as well. Since the late 1980s, Hamilton's work focused on
2237760	2243440	Antelope Valley, California. Many will know this region as one of the chief centers of aerospace
2243440	2250160	technology, housing the infamous USAF Plant 42 Lockheed Skunkworks, the former Norton Air Force
2250160	2255200	Base, the legendary Edwards Air Force Base, major installations for Northrop Grumman,
2255200	2260960	Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas, as well as numerous intriguing radar cross-section facilities
2260960	2266960	in the form of Northrop Tehan, Lockheed Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas. I have spoken on all of
2266960	2272160	the aforementioned facilities and prior work. Palmdale, California within the Antelope has
2272160	2277920	served as an unrivaled US military slash private contractor classified aircraft production and
2277920	2283120	maintenance location. The region has produced many of the United States most famous advanced
2283120	2291360	aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Night Hawk,
2291360	2296880	and F-35 Lightning. The Antelope Valley and the City of Palmdale have also served as a
2296880	2302080	critical pillar of my research. Whether this be Norton Air Force Base serving as the location
2302080	2306800	were primary witness Brad S observed the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle,
2306800	2312080	witness Ed disclosing his work for the 412th test group serving as test director for reverse
2312080	2318320	engineered vehicles out of Edwards. Edgar Fouchet, who stated pilots of the TR-3B reverse engineered
2318400	2324240	triangle ARV were plucked from the Edwards 412th Test Pilot School or the alleged project
2324240	2329600	red light out of Edwards which served to act alongside Area 51 to test reverse engineered
2329600	2335840	vehicles very similar to the claims of Ed. Antelope Valley is the most consequential location that
2335840	2341680	has ever come up in all of my research. The late Hamilton was obsessed with the radar cross-section
2341680	2347200	facilities mentioned above. Specifically the Northrop Tehan installation sometimes referred to as
2347200	2352880	the Tehachapi facility or Ant Hill. Due to the rumors of incredible amounts of underground tunnels
2352880	2359200	beneath the installation, in my video on Northrop I investigated this RCS facility in great detail.
2359200	2365120	Thanks to the research of Dr. Sotter we know the Northrop Tehan RCS does indeed have an underground
2365120	2371200	facility. Just as does Hellendale and McDonald Douglas, the question is how big, how deep,
2371200	2376960	and what do they do? Some rumors persist of up to 42 levels with underground tunnels connecting
2376960	2382480	the facility to Edwards and other installations. The concept of a corporate dumb should come as no
2382480	2388400	surprise to anyone. In 1981 the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, yes AT&T,
2388400	2394560	revealed several underground emergency centers. Believe it or not AT&T itself has been historically
2394560	2400160	implicated in non-human technology transfer but that is not our topic for today. These underground
2400160	2405600	centers exist 40 feet below ground and feature three story centers with data banks, dorms,
2405600	2411440	and kitchens. One such location is reported to exist in Catrone County, 180 miles near
2411440	2419120	Sandia National Labs. This is not surprising seen from 1949 to 1993 AT&T in its subsidiary
2419120	2424640	Western Electric ran Sandia National Labs at Kirtland at the order of President Harry S. Truman
2424640	2430240	for the Department of Energy. Indeed as recently as 1970 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey
2430240	2436400	operated an emergency center 300 feet underground near Hudson, New York. This location that more
2436400	2441760	recently held corporate reports featured dining halls and 50 sleeping rooms for key company
2441760	2448320	officials. But back to Tehan and quickly for those who don't know what exactly is a radar cross-section
2448320	2454160	facility. To summarize these facilities utilize high frequency radio waves to test aircraft's radar
2454160	2459360	signatures. This military testing aids in the development of stealth technologies by reducing
2459360	2464880	radar cross-section. The site features large runways and pylons raised from underground on
2464880	2470640	concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast aircraft and materials with radar. Many RCS
2470640	2475280	facilities including the Three and Antelope Valley saw construction during the Cold War.
2475280	2480800	This led the majority of the installation being built underground to hide RCS pylons equipment,
2480800	2486080	models, and technology away from Soviet spy satellites. Numerous researchers over the
2486080	2491280	years have accused the Northrop Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy
2491280	2496480	program locations focused on the downing retrieval and storage of non-human craft.
2496480	2501200	The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claims to have both knowledge of the entrance for the
2501200	2506400	Ant Hill Dumb as well as personally been flown over these sites and observed the electromagnetic
2506400	2511440	pulse weapon systems that are used to down craft. Now interestingly the Senate Intelligence and
2511440	2516880	Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people
2516880	2523360	and special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it.
2524640	2529440	I had known about it since the 90s but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's
2529440	2537840	classified airspace and very sensitive. So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.
2538480	2546240	It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.
2546880	2552960	They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-gravidic anti-grab. The diamond on the
2552960	2556800	left you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't
2556800	2561840	need to run and get there's not an aerodynamic. They just go boom up but they're placed so different
2561840	2566000	diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these we don't have time to go through
2566000	2572000	and that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic
2572720	2579040	weapon to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict, right?
2579680	2585120	When discussing the RCS facilities and in particular Hamilton's obsession with Tehan,
2585120	2591840	some may remember the XF-131 Super Sentinel. This incredible triangular ARV was drawn by
2591920	2597360	forensic artist Bill McDonald and later featured in season one of the X-Files.
2597360	2602000	According to McDonald, the craft design was relayed to him from two Northrop Tehan and
2602000	2607440	two Lockheed Hellendale engineers who were jaded from the intense secrecy from which they operated.
2607440	2612720	I personally have spoken to McDonald on numerous occasions regarding this triangular ARV out of
2612720	2618720	the Antelope Valley and put much credence into this testimony. For years Hamilton compiled first-hand
2618720	2623680	witness testimony regarding Antelope Valley and specifically the Northrop Tehachapi site.
2623680	2629840	Let's briefly investigate a few of these testimonies. A local man with property on 170th Street,
2629840	2635440	west of Tehan, reported to Hamilton of the ground opening like a missile silo where a flying saucer
2635440	2641600	took off. Edwards Air Force Office of Special Investigation silenced this witness. UFO researcher
2641600	2647200	Dr. Richard Boylan alongside the first-hand source of Bill McDonald have additionally accused Tehan
2647280	2652880	as a manufacturing site for reverse engineered vehicles including the X-F-131 Super Sentinel
2652880	2658720	and anti-gravity disc dubbed by Boylan the Great Pumpkin. A contractor named Chuck relayed his
2658720	2663760	experience digging the underground tunnels beneath the Ant Hill to Hamilton. This source claimed
2663760	2670000	tunnels in the Dumb had round doorways with few doors and red and green lights for ID and entry.
2670000	2674720	An intriguing source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on Project Star Talk at Tehan.
2674720	2679440	This project involved lasers in a big building underground for the purpose of constructing
2679440	2686000	systems to quote-unquote bring in UFOs. The source mentioned scalar technology, a concept Stephen
2686000	2692080	Greer would later on discuss for decades as a weapon source to down UFOs. The Star Talk informer
2692080	2697120	also claimed to work at McDonnell Douglas Stiff where he observed a UFO held in an underground
2697120	2703280	hangar. This name was very hard to make out by a 144p documentary but one Hamilton informer
2703280	2709120	went by the name Gobern who claimed to work at Tehan, Hellendale and the Nevada test and training
2709120	2715200	range. This source relayed to Hamilton he worked with alien technology that deeply frightened him.
2715200	2721040	According to the source on-site personnel would rotate every 14 to 16 days living and working
2721040	2726800	on site and there existed a command center under Haystack Butte which connected to the Ant Hill.
2726800	2731760	Hamilton had numerous other informers who would discuss experimental discs being flown out of
2731760	2737280	Edwards airfield, extraterrestrial discs being held under Edwards and underground UFO work below
2737280	2742480	a hangar on Edwards North Base. Many of these informants would discuss ground vehicles like
2742480	2747840	electric cars within the dumps and maglev train systems connecting the base to others. We will
2747840	2753840	of course discuss this much later on. From his data and sources Hamilton learned of a supposed
2753840	2759840	massive complex of underground facilities in the Antelope Valley engaged with UFO testing storage
2759840	2765840	and material exploitation. All connected via tunnels and transport systems these facilities
2765840	2771680	included Tahachapi, McDonnell Douglas, Hellendale, George Air Force Base Edwards, the NASA rocket
2771680	2777200	test site and China Lake. A network of joint USG and corporate facilities all connected in the
2777200	2782160	Antelope Valley dedicated to the storage and exploitation of UFOs has proven to be quite
2782160	2788320	a common theory since the late 80s and early 1990s work of Hamilton. I'd once again like to reference
2788320	2794480	Stephen Greer witness AH. I have discussed in multiple projects AH a Boeing insider with numerous
2794480	2800400	connections to UFO legacy programs has historically and likely to this day served as a primary source
2800400	2806000	of information for Greer. In his 2000 tape testimony AH delivered to Greer much of the
2806000	2810880	information Greer still discusses to this day including reference to a massive facility
2810880	2816960	existing below Dugway. AH additionally discussed a complex of underground facilities near Anzo
2816960	2821520	California just south of Antelope Valley while also addressing a critical Northrop
2821520	2827680	underground facility named of course Tehan. Did you share with you any other information on other
2827680	2835120	facilities that dealt with this issue in US or abroad? Yes he mentioned there's a base here in
2835120	2842960	California near Anzo California and there's another base in the deserts of I believe he said
2843280	2853200	Tacone or Tejon. I believe he said Tejon. I believe that's the word that he used there's a base
2854880	2863200	near Lancaster and Palmdale area and near this is very funny it's near Northrop there's an
2863200	2870960	underground area out there too that he was aware of and but he particularly mentioned and stayed
2870960	2876160	focused on Anzo California there's some underground areas up there too that they're
2877360	2884160	researching some of this technology and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.
2885040	2890160	Of this network of proposed facilities one possible dumb stands out from the rest
2890160	2895360	Edwards Air Force Base. As mentioned in nearly every project Edward serves as home to the
2895680	2902000	412th test group a major range and test facility base. Witness Ed a vetted and accomplished USAT
2902000	2907680	veteran claimed Edwards and the Nevada test and training range specifically Nellis Air Force Base
2907680	2914400	in Area 51 slash Groom Lake which is actually run by an Edwards 412th detachment runs a joint UFO
2914400	2919840	reverse engineering program. Outside of the claims of Hamilton's informants regarding Edwards and
2919840	2924080	craft stored in underground installations there are many fascinating testimonies and
2924080	2929280	avenues of research we might pursue. Remember how one source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on
2929280	2934480	the Ant Hill installation under Tejon in Antelope Valley. The source claimed the installation's
2934480	2940240	command center existed under Edwards Haystack Butte. This sentiment is shared by the controversial
2940240	2945280	and enigmatic whistleblower Dr. Michael Wolfe who claimed as a UAP consultant to the National
2945280	2950640	Security Council he heard live extraterrestrials were kept under Haystack Butte Edwards.
2950640	2956320	Test facilities are built into an on Haystack Butte east of Edwards indeed these facilities
2956320	2961520	are run alongside a primary field lab at the remote northeast corner of Edwards by the Air Force
2961520	2967600	Research Lab's Aerospace Systems Directorate. AFRL Edwards 412th Test Wing and NASA Flight
2967600	2973200	Research Facility work together at Edwards to plan conduct analyze and report on all flight
2973200	2978640	and ground testing of aircraft weapon systems software and components as well as modeling and
2978640	2983920	simulation for the USAF. Since facilities are built into the Butte it is no stretch to assume
2983920	2990000	locations are built under the Haystack Butte and remember this USAF AFRL rocket propulsion
2990000	2995200	division and their rocket test labs on Lumen Ridge were named by Hamilton and his informants as
2995200	3001200	featuring a stiff location connected to the wider Edwards underground complex. This lab features a
3001200	3005840	number of underground missile silos but the extent to which the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory
3006320	3011600	underground is unknown however and very interesting numerous studies out of the Air Force Rocket
3011600	3017120	Propulsion Lab have shown a heavy interest in anti-gravity propulsion is this location definitely
3017120	3023760	UFO legacy related unknown but a strong argument can be made from witness testimony and lastly a bit
3023760	3030240	north to Antelope is China Lake Naval Air Weapon Station as we showed in a 1964 Army Corps of
3030240	3035760	Engineers study titled Feasibility of Constructing Large Underground Cavities Inyo County which
3035760	3041280	shares territory with China Lake was considered for underground purposes the underground cavity of
3041280	3047520	interest was 4,000 feet deep and it is unknown if this facility was built however numerous witness
3047520	3053840	testimony may give us some idea as we also discussed above Dr. Sotter had been given testimony by Navy
3053840	3058560	Veterans stationed at China Lake who not only claimed the facility goes one mile deep but
3058560	3064160	weapons work is conducted on quote weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons end quote
3064160	3069120	Hamilton himself also had a source who allegedly served as an aerospace engineer consultant to
3069120	3074400	NASA and Colonel this unnamed Colonel claimed he worked at an underground installation at China
3074400	3079520	Lake Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada test site these locations were according to the source
3079520	3084880	connected via a maglev train system from which he would often enter through a dump beneath White
3084960	3090560	Sands missile range I put stock in this testimony due to speaking myself to a witness who claimed
3090560	3096720	to travel via underground train system from a fort in Texas to White Sands this source an army
3096720	3102960	officer in the 2010s claimed the train speed and acceleration were so great it reminded him of his
3102960	3110000	fear of flying we also have Ed and the mention of Edwards and the NTTR China Lake is not mentioned
3110000	3114640	in his testimony however it stands to reason the very near China Lake which serves as the
3114640	3121520	Navy's largest single land holding representing 85% of the Navy's weapons and armaments are DT&E
3121520	3128160	programs could likely see crossover TUO programs with the USAF if these programs exchange nonhuman
3128160	3133680	craft materials and research it stands to reason such transactions would be conducted underground
3133680	3139600	to maintain secrecy I would in the future like to do an entire video on China Lake so hang tight
3139600	3145440	corporate and military installations do indeed exist below Antelope Valley again the question
3145440	3151280	is do these sites deal with technologies of unknown origin and exploitation programs Antelope
3151280	3159200	and Palmdale are home to aerospace juggernauts and myriad DOD RDT&E and MRTFBs and have for decades
3159200	3165680	featured numerous testimonies of ARV underground installations and claims of UFO legacy programs
3165680	3170960	due to these factors plus witnesses who have told me they have traveled below the Antelope Valley
3170960	3177600	I am inclined to conclude such an anthill if so to speak does in fact exist to work on UFO legacy
3177600	3187440	programs the vast majority of our focus today is the American Southwest and endless claims of
3187440	3193760	underground UFO research in RDT&E but quickly I do want to look east we have already discussed
3193840	3200880	STIFs used by the CIA and NSA under cover of the Army and Navy respectively but what about UFO
3200880	3206240	STIFs for this reason I would like to look to the United States Capitol and address the deep
3206240	3212400	underground command center the DUCC was a stiff below the Pentagon that was never built however I
3212400	3218160	am not sure just how true that statement is now an acknowledged stiff under the Pentagon does indeed
3218160	3223120	exist the national military command center responsible for generating emergency action
3223120	3228160	messages to missile control launch centers nuclear subs and battlefield commanders this
3228160	3235280	NMCC was set to serve as an interim facility for the never built DUCC the deep underground command
3235280	3242160	center was first proposed in 1963 three weeks before the assassination of JFK declassified top
3242160	3248640	secret documents dated 7 november 63 detail former secretary of defense Robert McNamara proposing
3248640	3253920	meetings to discuss the national underground command center these plans for the national or
3253920	3259680	deep underground command center detailed a complex command center built 3,500 feet below
3259680	3265920	Washington DC this location would be built to withstand direct hits of 200 to 300 megaton
3265920	3271600	warheads that penetrate 70 to 100 feet below the surface before detonation two separate
3271600	3278080	facilities were proposed an austere facility with 10,000 total square feet and 5,000 operating
3278080	3284720	square feet accommodating 40 people at a depth of 3,500 feet this would cost over 110 million
3284720	3292160	dollars or 1.1 billion today the second was a moderate sized facility with 100,000 total
3292160	3298640	square feet and 50,000 operating square feet accommodating 300 people at a depth of 3,500
3298640	3306080	feet this would cost 310 million or over 3.2 billion dollars today the joint chiefs interestingly
3306080	3311520	proposed the austere facility to be too small the operation capsule of the center would be
3311520	3316960	near the pentagon and an access elevator would descend 3,500 feet underground from the pentagon
3317360	3322960	installation this may seem like a massive undertaking however the memorandum stated quote
3322960	3328800	there is little argument that the construction of a du cc is technically feasible end quote to
3328800	3334400	quote the memo again quote the nature of the du cc regardless of the initial size selected
3334400	3340240	lends itself to later expansion end quote once linden b johnson took office a second
3340240	3348320	memorandum was issued 16 january 1964 from wall rosto to mcgeorge bundy stating the du cc concept
3348320	3354480	should proceed rosto served as a senior advisor to both kennedy and johnson an additional memo
3354480	3359920	followed the same day from mcgeorge bundy to carl kason showing planning for the du cc had been
3359920	3365360	going forward since the early days of the johnson admin kason was deputy special assistant for national
3365360	3371760	security affairs to kennedy and possibly stayed on to advise on the du cc program the memo additionally
3371760	3378000	stated kason having spoken to herald brown read the du cc brown served as director of defense
3378000	3384640	research and engineering from 1961 to 1965 a last top secret memo dealing with the du cc
3384640	3391920	was issued by the bureau of the budget estimated between 1963 to 1964 40 plus percent of this
3391920	3398240	document is redacted was the du cc ever built conventional sources would say no however i
3398240	3403840	would argue indeed it was this confidence of mine is from sources who have described to me
3403840	3409840	firsthand encounters within an enormous cavernous facility below the pentagon but how does such a
3409840	3416480	proposed facility deal with the subject of ufo's if the du cc was indeed built it is a publicly
3416480	3422720	denied site therefore we can feasibly reckon if the site does exist it deals with subjects critical
3422720	3429360	to us national security since the 1954 atomic energy agreement materials pertaining to ufo's
3429360	3435440	have been misclassified as trans classified foreign nuclear materials as relayed by physicists robert
3435440	3441280	sarbacher in 1950 ufo programs exist and their classification resides even higher than that of
3441280	3447280	the h-bomb on this channel i've spoken in-depth at ufo legacy program operations are the ultimate
3447280	3453600	secret deep-six clandestine set of programs deeply embedded within special access programs
3453600	3460240	the pentagon resides near crystal city crystal city features eight of ten of the us's top defense
3460240	3465680	contractors in the small neighborhood is where two-thirds of federal contracts are awarded by
3466400	3471600	this location holds primary offices held by northrop grumman, lockheed martin, boeing,
3471600	3478560	wrathion, general dynamics, l3, aerojet, rockadine, and more all contractors i highly suspect engage
3478560	3485040	with ufo programs the neighborhood also holds or is in close proximity to numerous ffr dcs i
3485040	3491040	believe are up to their eyeballs in ufo programs these include the center for naval analyses
3491040	3496880	institute for defense analysis aerospace corporation and rand homeland security operations
3496880	3502640	analysis center additionally crystal city is home to myriad do d research agencies including
3502640	3508560	darpa office of naval research and air force office of scientific research i do believe similar to
3508560	3514720	the antelope valley crystal city's amalgamation of do d entities ffr dcs and contractors is a
3514800	3521520	major center of operations for ufo legacy programs perhaps due to limited airspace and usage of mrt
3521520	3527680	fbs unlike the american desert in southwest crystal city is where the majority of ufo related usaps
3527680	3533440	are created maintained and kept secure this is a thesis i will continue to explore in depth in
3533440	3539280	the future if crystal city does indeed majorly engage with clandestine ufo unacknowledged special
3539360	3544880	access programs it stands to reason such a classified effort involving do d private and
3544880	3548720	semi-private entities would require a massive underground facility
3553840	3559120	the idea of a major network of underground tunnels connecting dumps nationwide is often
3559120	3565120	scoffed at i have no idea if the entire nation's stiffs are connected via tunnel system but a
3565120	3570240	strong argument can be made complex systems of interconnecting stiffs exist in the american
3570240	3576560	southwest and east coast after all in a document obtained via foya by dr richard solder we even
3576560	3581840	have hard numbers from the military industrial complex of the estimated number of total personnel
3581840	3587680	needed to build and operate a deeply buried hundreds of mile long tunnel system and this is the order
3587680	3594640	of 7800 to 8700 people and we also have a hard estimate for the total expenses associated with
3594640	3600640	constructing operating and maintaining such a system the neighborhood of 17 billion dollars over
3600640	3606000	a 10-year period many such acknowledged tunnel systems exist like the department of energy
3606000	3611040	sprawling tunnel network below the nevada test and training range but let's continue to explore
3611040	3616960	the feasibility of massive tunnel systems connecting bases dozens or hundreds of miles apart the
3616960	3622320	technology for such undertakings does indeed exist the most likely candidates are nuclear
3622320	3627920	subterranes and tunnel boring machines tunnel boring machines are huge cylindrical mechanical
3627920	3632720	boring machines that tunnel through rock and soil chewing out circular tunnels that may range in
3632720	3638960	diameter of up to 35 or more feet these goliaths are powered by electrical motors that have a
3638960	3644000	cutting head equipped with various metal attachments made of super hard alloys that cut through rock
3644000	3649760	as the head rotates the head rotates and the cutting tools dig into the rock ripping and gouging it
3649760	3655120	away the excavated rock or muck is then passed by a conveyor assembly to the rear of the machine
3655120	3660080	where it can be hauled away by truck or train according to the pacific gas and electric company
3660080	3666800	utilizing a robin's company tbm to bore a 22 000 foot long 24 foot diameter tunnel it took a rate of
3666800	3672720	five to six miles per year however in better conditions some tbms could bore at a rate of 10
3672720	3678880	miles per year or greater roughly double the rate of the pacific gas and electric company this would
3678880	3684960	mean dumbs below china lake and edwards could be connected in as little as five and a half years
3684960	3690160	nuclear subterranes were originally designed by low salamos national lab sound familiar the
3690160	3694880	patents for such machines were filed technical documents were written but the project seemingly
3694880	3700400	faded into obscurity these fascinating machines work by melting through rock and soil leaving
3700400	3706160	neat solidly glass lined tunnels by vitrifying materials heat is supplied to the system via
3706160	3711440	compact nuclear reactors that circulate liquid lithium from the reactor core to the tunnel face
3711440	3716720	melting rock in front of the machine cooled liquid lithium then circulates to the back of the machine
3716720	3721920	alongside the exterior of the machine to cool surrounding rock as the machine is forced forward
3721920	3729360	patents were first proposed by the atomic energy commission in us energy rnd in 1972 and 1975
3729440	3735360	further nuclear subterranean patents in 1975 detailed tunnel systems of 12 meters or more in
3735360	3740640	diameter all but one of the inventors listed in the three patents above were from low salamos
3740640	3747280	additionally at 1973 low salamos study titled systems and cost analysis for a nuclear subterranean
3747280	3751840	tunnel machine a preliminary study concluded nuclear subterranes to be a cost efficient
3751840	3757360	solution to satisfy us transportation tunnel demands similar to how we deduce numerous
3757360	3762800	dumps were built around 1961 to 1989 we can make similar deductions regarding connective
3762800	3767760	tunnel systems if such an enormous tunnel system exists it likely saw construction
3767760	3775040	beginning around the early 1970s 1974 to be exact the bechtel corporation is an american
3775040	3780240	engineering procurement and construction management company founded in the u.s bechtel has often
3780240	3786640	been targeted as one of the u.s corporations responsible for dumb tunnel systems in 1974
3786640	3791840	bechtel released a report titled research program plan for meeting tomorrow's needs in tunneling
3791840	3797360	and excavation final report this report states quote the demand for tunneling and underground
3797360	3803120	excavation for national defense needs is believed to be large some examples of underground defense
3803120	3809280	facilities include hard rock silos command posts communication systems personnel shelters storage
3809280	3814160	and power generation facilities end quote interestingly enough the same report shows
3814160	3821040	a massive list of novel ground disintegration techniques in r&d stages in 1972 the governing
3821040	3826480	board of the national research council formed the u.s national committee on tunneling technology
3826480	3831200	this committee functioned as the quote united states focal agency in the field of tunneling
3831200	3836240	technology to assess and stimulate improvements in tunneling technology applications and to
3836240	3843040	coordinate us tunneling technology activities with those of other nations end quote by 1977 this
3843040	3849680	us n t t had six major subcommittees including the deep cavity and tunnel support systems committees
3849680	3856000	us n c t t partnered with numerous corporations agencies and academics of particular interest
3856000	3861840	to this channel these include both sandia national labs and bechtel memorial institute i've accused
3861840	3868640	bechtel of engaging deeply with uap legacy programs including operations at the dugway alleged dumb
3868640	3876000	in 1981 in 1982 the us n c t t sponsored a project called workshop on technology for the design and
3876000	3881600	construction of deep underground defense facilities this was done at the behest of the nuclear defense
3881600	3888480	agency and co-sponsors included the bureau of reclamation army usaf navy do e and national
3888480	3893760	science foundation including others the 1982 report of the workshop detailed the need for
3893760	3900640	400 miles of tunnels ranging from 2500 to 3500 feet for various purposes including housing nuclear
3900640	3906400	missiles these tunnels were to be up to 16 feet in diameter with quote interconnecting passageways
3906400	3911920	and add its horizontal passageways for storage living quarters and other needs end quote the
3911920	3916800	location of such a network of tunnels according to the new york times would be quote probably in
3916800	3922000	the desert of the western united states such tunnels and installations were to be powered
3922000	3928400	via fuel cells or nuclear reactors and as we saw in 1963 the us army corps of engineers was very
3928400	3934560	serious about nuclear reactors powering self-contained underground installations fuel cells may also be
3934560	3940000	of special interest here seen as in 1984 bowing published the results of a study that set forth
3940000	3946400	plans for power generation in deep icb m bases using iron chlorine fuel cells to generate power
3946400	3952800	the usn ctt called for mobilization of this plan in the late 80s and early 90s the committee called
3952800	3960720	for tunnel boring machines to be utilized starting in 1985 for carving tunnel systems by 1988 usn ctt
3960720	3965840	was publishing reports titled tunneling and underground space technology discussing underground
3965840	3972960	missile systems ranging between 3000 to 8000 feet underground during this period in the 80s numerous
3972960	3977920	contractors i have directly accused of being involved in ufo legacy programs would aid in the
3977920	3983360	construction of deep underground missile bases and tunnel systems of course we must assume some if
3983360	3989200	not many underground nuclear missile bases may have served as clandestine rd tne facilities
3989200	3993600	this should not come as a shock as we have already discussed us intelligence agencies
3993600	3999680	utilizing underground military sites for secret operations such corporations include bdm who was
3999680	4005520	awarded in 1985 a contract to conduct quote intercontinental ballistic missile deep basing
4005520	4012160	communication study end quote as well as trw who had since 1968 been involved in studies into high
4012160	4017680	speed ground transportation tunnel design and cost analysis both corporations were later on
4017680	4024640	bought by northrop grumman the 1985 bdm study is of particular interest here remember if you will
4024640	4031760	earlier that same year 20 to 25 may 1985 to be exact bdm mclean also held the advanced
4031760	4037360	theoretical physics conference the meetings of this exclusive group were classified utilizing
4037360	4043120	doe controls notes of this conference were released by attendee oki shannon who formally
4043120	4049520	served as manager for special projects at low salamos national labs this mclean virginia secure
4049520	4055200	facility group discussed myriad aspects of ufo's including legacy programs and a major
4055200	4061200	engineering project under bobby ray inman viewers of my channel will absolutely recall inman
4061200	4067920	mentioned often as a senior ufo legacy operations member at this time the vice president of bdm
4067920	4073920	was former major general and founder of us army inscom albert stubblebine stubblebine will be
4073920	4079120	mentioned again in this project including how he was accused of engaging in ufo craft storage
4079120	4085200	and material exploitation while head of army intelligence at fort hachuka arizona interestingly
4085200	4090400	the advanced theoretical working group was spearheaded by us army colonel john b alexander
4090400	4097040	who from 1982 to 1983 reported directly to stubblebine additionally recall how philip j
4097040	4102800	corso claimed a ufo working group was established in the mid 80s according to corso this group
4102800	4108560	saw ample funding from us army inscom general stubblebine it is interesting to think of
4108560	4114480	possible ties between this icbm deep basing communication study and albert stubblebine
4114480	4120000	and the advanced theoretical physics conference and a possible ufo working group accused by philip
4120000	4125600	j corso throughout the 1980s us industry and government additionally demonstrated a keen
4125600	4130880	interest in life support systems for massive tunnel systems underground icbm installations
4130880	4137680	as well as deep and i mean deep underground bases this can be demonstrated in a november 1985
4137680	4142880	contract to uni tech technologies hamilton standard division for life support and chemical
4142880	4149520	biological agent mitigation system on small icbm deep basing programs end quote us army
4149520	4155920	corps of engineers as well as us nctt have even discussed provable technologies times and prices
4155920	4163200	to construct such massive tunnel systems yet no data exists on any large-scale tunneling project
4163200	4168240	this may force us to look deeper like at the low-profile records of the bureau of reclamation
4168240	4173360	who during the 20th century excavated hundreds of miles of tunnels up to 28 and a half feet in
4173360	4178720	diameter at depths of hundreds to thousands of feet quite often the bureau would utilize
4178720	4184080	classic tunnel boring machines numerous inside sources to dr richard solder have informed him
4184080	4188720	that some of the bureau of reclamation's tunnels have doubled as cover for other clandestine
4188720	4194400	underground tunnels to quote underground and underwater bases quote from a hypothetical
4194400	4199520	point of view what is to stop a tunnel boring machine from tunneling off of an aqueduct tunnel
4199520	4204880	deep underground and striking out secretly to make a clandestine tunnel it takes about 10 men
4204880	4210960	to operate a tbm and in good rock you can count on as much as 15 miles of tunnel per year end quote
4210960	4221120	for decades rumors of underground railroad systems specifically maglev trains have been
4221120	4226960	inseparable from testimony regarding dums and ufo's as we discussed earlier in the antelope
4226960	4232640	valley section such a concept was related to ufo researcher bill hamilton by some of his many
4232640	4237760	informants but just how true are these rumors of a high-speed electromagnetic railroad system
4237760	4243840	often described as a pneumatic system aka a train system operating in a partial vacuum tube
4243840	4249680	to begin what is maglev maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetic
4249680	4255200	rather than employing wheels maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad
4255200	4261120	systems including higher speeds superior acceleration and deceleration lower maintenance costs
4261120	4266800	improved gradient handling and lower noise but are much more expensive compared to traditional
4266800	4274160	systems maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour and pneumatic tube trains are an
4274160	4279120	early form of transportation or air vacuum to move containers or vehicles through tubes while
4279120	4284320	minimizing friction new york's first subway system was an underground pneumatic tube transport
4284320	4289920	line created by alfred elie beach earlier in this project we spoke of nazi scientists being
4289920	4295760	sequestered by air material command in the us to work on underground complexes i would also
4295760	4300960	like to draw attention to herman kemper kemper was a third rike engineer who created a concept for
4300960	4306800	the roarbon the roarbon was a system of magnetic levitation trains designed to speed through
4306800	4312400	underground vacuum tunnels at hundreds or even thousands of miles per hour suspended passenger
4312400	4317840	cars on magnetic fields would be propelled through tunnels negating any friction of wheels rails and
4317840	4324800	air kemper's research began in 1934 by 1938 he envisioned berlin connected to other european
4324800	4331600	cities with cars traveling at 600 to 1000 miles per hour it is unknown how far the nazis pursued
4331600	4336960	this concept nor is it known if kemper was recruited by operation paperclip a feasible
4336960	4343280	hypothesis here is kemper was contracted by the us to help build early iterations of maglev pneumatic
4343280	4350000	systems maglev ufo's and dumbs are often lumped together as conspiracy however maglevs are not
4350000	4356800	a niche concept since the 1960s maglev technology has seen numerous patents and by the year 2000
4356800	4361920	even lockheed martin entered into agreements with trans rapid international usa to develop
4361920	4369120	maglev technology in the us in fact by the early 1990s an acknowledged multi agency national maglev
4369120	4374880	institute was formed this joint effort by the doe and us army corps of engineers sought to quote
4374880	4380320	define the role maglev could play in us transportation system to assess the potential for
4380320	4385840	maglev in the domestic market to recommend a strategy for the introduction of maglev technology
4385840	4392080	and to identify the most appropriate federal role end quote this nmi published a report in the early
4392080	4397680	nineties titled compendium of executive summaries from the maglev system concept definition final
4397680	4403360	reports this series of reports sought to determine nationwide maglev system availability by the year
4403440	4408800	2000 some interesting players appear in this document this includes a joint project with
4408800	4415200	bechtel hughes aircraft and mit which employs a uark for the army a second report saw work by
4415200	4421440	bowing aerospace and general dynamics to study superconducting levitation to top this off a third
4421440	4427040	study saw joint efforts into superconducting magnets performed by grumman corporation pre northrop
4427040	4433760	betel memorial labs and honeywell all contractors mentioned above in above board maglev technology
4433760	4439280	research i highly spect have for decades attempted the reverse engineering and material exploitation
4439280	4446320	of non-human craft however rumors of clandestine maglev systems far precede the 1990s and 2000s
4446320	4452480	dr richard solder as well as bill hamilton first heard whispers of such systems in the 1980s solder
4452480	4458160	himself referenced reading reports of underground rail systems to area 51 from mercury nevada and
4458160	4463760	the naval surface warfare center corona division discussion of these rail systems would even pop
4463760	4471360	up in online ufo forums around 1997 look at the name on the top of these testimony reports a j
4471360	4476960	kradoc in disgust in the dugway project kradoc is an oil tycoon operating in libya that helped
4477040	4482880	steven greer in the 1990s with c setty kradoc brought greer in my opinion incredibly valuable
4482880	4489680	and relevant information regarding area 51 moving many ufo operations to dugway so if maglev systems
4489680	4495120	existed far before ufo legacy program defense contractors engaged with the acknowledged national
4495120	4500480	maglev institute where and when might these systems have been developed and of what technology
4500480	4505520	the mid 1960s saw established engineering professors from the office of naval research
4505520	4510720	army research office and booze allen hamilton established the international society for terrain
4510720	4517680	vehicle systems or istv real quick in the mid to late 20th century i believe booze allen hamilton
4517680	4523040	was as involved in ufo legacy operations as northrop grumman is today but that's another project
4523040	4529040	for another day the istv s working group coordinated research around high speed underground tube
4529040	4534880	train systems at the same time of the istv s the u.s department of commerce established a
4534880	4541920	multi agency panel focused on high speed underground tube train systems the panel produced a 1967
4541920	4547760	report titled rnd for high speed ground transportation which states quote regardless of the system
4547760	4552480	adopted it can be assumed that extensive tunneling will be involved it is recommended that the
4552480	4557920	department cooperate closely with other agencies in planning and funding research into this area
4557920	4564000	to provide an extra stimulus for rapid development end quote of massive consequence to this investigation
4564000	4570400	in 1972 robert salter of the rand corporation published a study titled the very high speed
4570400	4575760	transit system in this study ran set out a continental deep underground concept that was
4575760	4581280	described as quote electromagnetically levitated and propelled cars in an evacuated tunnel end
4581280	4587120	quote the study makes some truly shocking statements including quote speeds as high as 14
4587120	4592400	thousand miles per hour have been examined and studies by the rand corporation in an example
4592400	4597840	case of a direct link between los angeles and new york requiring only 21 minutes of transit time
4597840	4602960	the speeds required will certainly be on the order of thousands of miles per hour on long
4602960	4608400	haul links end quote i believe salter additionally makes a critical statement that lends strongly
4608400	4614160	towards the subject of ufo legacy dumps salter states quote because of the rather considerable
4614160	4620880	expanse of the tunnel it is probable that the first vhst will not rely on a direct nonstop la and
4620880	4626080	white link but rather one that stops at two intermediate staging points end quote these
4626080	4630640	intermediate staging points are apparent when throughout this video i have made and will continue
4630640	4636800	to make in the hamilton map segment the argument that ufo dump networks feature central hubs these
4636800	4642480	hubs if so to speak are connected to one another and branch to local smaller dump facilities think
4642480	4647600	of a railway central station connecting to other major stations while also featuring alternative
4647600	4653520	lines to small local stops much of this technology was based on work conducted by robert goddard
4653520	4659520	father of modern rocketry's 1945 vacuum tube transport system as well as michael minovich the
4659520	4665280	physicists behind introducing gravity assisted propulsion around planetary bodies 1961 work
4665280	4671120	deep underground tube shuttle salter and ran strongly recommended placing the vhst underground
4671120	4675440	to remove interference with environmental factors such as grade crossings weather and
4675440	4680560	infrastructure and also observed that it was not appreciable harder to tunnel at great lengths
4680560	4687200	underground than at shallow depths within this study is a map of the proposed vhst that corresponds
4687200	4692720	strongly to build hamilton's alleged western state dump network but more on this later around a
4692720	4698240	similar time frame to this ran study is the high speed ground transportation initiative this group
4698240	4704000	became operational in the 1960s performing most of their work in the 1970s before slipping out of
4704000	4710880	public view in the 1980s for a period of 10 to 15 years the united states saw enormous efforts into
4710880	4717120	rnd and feasibility and desirability of high speed underground tube shuttle train systems
4717120	4723760	entities involved in this program are countless including trw general dynamics mit southwest
4723760	4730000	research institute behind project stargate general electric nasa army navy and batel memorial
4730000	4734400	institute i have mentioned some of the work published under this initiative before including
4734400	4741040	trw's 1967 study titled abstracts of concepts of high speed ground transportation systems
4741040	4746320	remember trw was purchased by northrop grumman and long considered as the contractor behind the
4746320	4752640	majestic 12 like entity project zodiac for the high speed ground transportation initiative trw
4752640	4758320	additionally prepared a study titled state of the art tube vehicle system in 1970 this study
4758320	4763440	discussed tube systems and tunnels as deep as 3000 feet underground using trains that would
4763440	4770560	travel at speeds of 450 miles per hour similar to the dumb tunnel concept no admission of maglevs
4770560	4775680	connecting stiffs is publicly available however there is an overwhelming body of historical
4775680	4780640	evidence the us and defense contractors have had a keen interest in high speed underground
4780720	4784800	transit systems traveling at least as fast as a commercial airliner
4789440	4795040	to close off our investigation i would like to return to 1992's cosmic top secret by bill
4795040	4800640	hamilton in this masterpiece of a book hamilton provides a map of underground facilities and
4800640	4808720	tunnels provided to him by one tal in 1990 some data here is from thomas c aka thomas castillo
4808720	4813520	which is an extremely controversial source with the dulce new mexico story so instead
4813520	4819120	let's go ahead and analyze the map this network spans the american west and southwest with major
4819120	4825360	installations listed in southern california new mexico and colorado as expected earlier we find
4825360	4831440	edwards air force based connected to myriad locations including numerous small marks labeled rnd
4831440	4837760	we also see a supposed underground base marked cat this is of course catalina island fascinating
4837760	4844560	how in 2023 and 2024 discussion began to swirl of an underground extraterrestrial or human base
4844560	4850720	off of catalina island we also see area 51 as a major reference with connections to tonipa
4850720	4856880	an installation infamous in ufo lore as well we also find interesting solo mark dumps not connected
4856880	4862800	in this alleged system including fort hutchuka arizona a location i estimate is involved heavily
4862800	4868880	in ufo programs remember if you will fort hutchuka holds a defense agency major range and test
4868880	4874880	facility base a critical core facility called the joint interoperability center army intelligence
4874880	4880960	at fort hutchuka was previously run by us army inscom founder major general albert stubblebine
4880960	4885760	stubblebine and inscom have been accused by myself in numerous projects amongst others as
4885760	4891120	engaging in ufo crash retrieval storage and material exploitation therefore it is really
4891120	4896960	no surprise to see hamilton's map designate fort hutchuka as a dumb location on the map are many
4896960	4903280	locations in new mexico including the controversial dulci los alamos and sandia slash curtland
4903280	4909280	the latter two we know have underground facilities indeed the same extents to shayan in colorado
4909280	4914400	intriguing to note here is an installation in chihuahua mexico this subject wouldn't be touched
4914960	4921280	jake barbers romana clay called sentinels of ether this project describes a 2004 blue on
4921280	4926960	blue ufo retrieval team fire operation in which the clandestine team flew into a disguised base
4926960	4932560	hidden in the mountains of chihuahua what happens when we start to compare this map to others
4932560	4938480	see now a comparison between hamilton's dumb network and rand's vhst see the interesting
4938480	4943760	direct route shared across the two maps through the northern area of arizona and new mexico
4943840	4948400	additionally observe how southern california sees routes split to both southern california
4948400	4953520	near san diego and northern california near sacramento before continuing north to portland
4953520	4959200	in washington also notice connections to denver on both locations outside of shayan mountain
4959200	4965760	complex denver colorado is home to an enormous underground fema complex this is likely a continuity
4965760	4971680	of government or c o g complex my true interest lies in comparing the hamilton piece to defense
4971680	4976720	laboratories and centers across the united states here we will not find groom lake amongst
4976720	4981520	other select facilities but i believe this comparison is of critical importance if you
4981520	4987360	will please forgive the maps not lining up the 1990 map is scaled differently than the 2019
4987360	4993520	do d map so the two are not merged to scale perfectly aligning the two maps brings extreme
4993520	4998880	interest to both dumb locations as well as markings on the hamilton piece that are labeled rnd
4998880	5004160	since this map pertains to connected underground ufo installations we can assume by the maps legend
5004160	5010560	these locations do not employ dumps but are still focused on ufo legacy rnd as expected southern
5010560	5015360	california brings a massive amount of locations of interest even outside of the antelope valley
5015360	5022560	to the southwest in los angeles lies a tremendous amount of do d rd t ne labs ffr dcs like rand
5022560	5028560	and aerospace corporations and uarks like the usc institute for creative technologies numerous
5028640	5033520	other locations outside of the antelope line up between the two maps we have discussed throughout
5033520	5040080	this investigation including fort hachuka shyan mountain colorado dugway and its two mrtfb's
5040080	5046480	low salamos white sands missile range sandia and curtland air force base from referencing do d labs
5046480	5051920	we can also learn curtland and its proven underground facilities stand out even more curtland
5051920	5057120	additionally holds the air force research labs space vehicles directorate and directed energy
5057120	5062720	directorate of note shared on these maps albeit slightly shifted is the fourth defense estate
5062720	5069120	microelectronics activity in northern california in do d terms fourth estate describes non-military
5069120	5074720	parts of the do d these include the defense contract audit agency defense contract management
5074720	5080320	agency and the defense finance and accounting service fourth estate agencies and field activities
5080320	5085920	all watching this video might recognize our darpa and the defense missile agency prior to this
5085920	5091520	investigation i had never come across mention of a dumb below the d m e a so this is a terrific
5091520	5096800	point of research moving forward let's also reference more of the non-connected rnd locations
5096800	5103200	on hamilton's map that exist as acknowledged do d rd t ne facilities in nebraska on both maps
5103200	5108000	we find identification of the us stratcom university affiliated research center the
5108000	5113280	university of nebraska national strategic research institute viewers of my work know
5113280	5119200	uarcs and ffr dcs are cornerstones of uap legacy program so it is interesting to see
5119200	5126880	hamilton identify a uarc as a ufo rnd location all the way back in 1992 that would not be founded
5126880	5134320	until 2012 in oklahoma we observe fort sill as ufo rnd and the naval surface warfare center
5134320	5139840	indian head special weapons division mccallister detachment as ufo storage i have come across
5139840	5146160	both of these locations in my research however it is interesting to see an nswc location labeled as
5146160	5151920	storage especially after the testimony of randy anderson and the off-world technologies division
5151920	5157760	at the naval surface warfare centered crane in northern kansas we observe overlap of a ufo
5157760	5164240	research facility this facility is the us army leavenworth research unit in texas we find fort
5164240	5169760	hood army research unit as a ufo research location however it is interesting to see this facility
5169760	5175600	is not marked as a stiff especially after numerous testimony relayed by and research done by lennard
5175600	5181280	stringfield the hamilton map deserves an entire investigation of its own and possibly i will do
5181280	5187840	so with dr sotter because after all this map does accuse dumbs of existing at all locations we
5187840	5193520	have previously discussed as well as many that warrant further investigation including fort
5193520	5200640	stockton fort urwin vandenberg a fb chocolate mountains aerial gunnery range 29 palms hutchinson
5200640	5206160	air force station and peterson air force base as well as the cities of kingsley nebraska
5206160	5212640	tulsa oklahoma and riverton wyoming i have spoken to dr sotter and he has spoken directly with bill
5212640	5219040	hamilton regarding this map so just maybe he can aid in further dissecting of these locations
5219040	5223920	hey guys it's gerb and if you're still with me thank you so much for joining me in this
5224560	5230880	at this point hour 20 hour and a half investigation into dumbs as many of you know and as many people
5230880	5235840	have been looking forward to this project dumbs are a passion project of mine i speak about
5235840	5240960	installations under dugway under the antelope valley under the north of tejon and hellendale
5240960	5247920	facilities in numerous videos uh i think probably my last four videos straight i've mentioned one
5247920	5253680	if not multiple of these locations as we made it to the end of this video i'd like to thank again
5253680	5258720	dr richard sotter for all of his excellent research now this video is going to be doing things a little
5258720	5263040	bit differently of course in every single one of my videos i include my show notes in the video
5263040	5269440	description or a link please bear with me a couple days here as i have not only compiled my research
5269440	5275680	links for this video but also every single document that i can find that dr richard sotter
5275680	5281200	has included in his three books so every single defense technical document every single army
5281200	5285760	corps of engineer document every single document i could find which there's hundreds so please allow
5285760	5292000	me a couple days to compile all that and deliver that because i think it's excellent to read through
5292000	5297920	all of those and please read through dr richard sotter's books they're they're excellent as we
5297920	5302560	know from today the subject of dumbs is very vast it's almost impossible to know where and when to
5302640	5308480	start there is a tremendous amount of literature on deep underground facilities for continuity of
5308480	5314720	government use for icbm silos for just general underground installations accessible by vertical
5314720	5320400	or inclined shaft there's also a tremendous amount of information specifically starting post 1974
5320400	5329200	with bechtel on large-scale tunneling systems and conventional and unconventional the blasting
5329200	5333280	methods this would be a tunnel boring machine or a nuclear subterranean as a conventional method
5333280	5338880	or explosives or possibly nuclear detonation as unconventional and also a lot of literature on
5338880	5345600	maglev technology i know these three subjects of interconnected dumb bases are often scoffed at without
5346320	5354480	a lot of research but this is a very serious subject and at least i would say focused in the
5354480	5359840	southwest and the american desert and the east there are probably large networks of
5359840	5365280	dumps this would include new mexico arizona southern california possibly up to connecting
5365280	5371040	to dugway and colorado and then a network out east including the warrenton army training facility
5371040	5379600	camp piery camp david uh the du cc which i wager highly exists and so forth now of course
5380480	5386160	let's treat this video as a part one a part two will be a project with dr richard solder
5386160	5391120	i spoke to him the other week for about two to three hours and he graciously agreed to come on
5391120	5396160	the show and talk more about dumps i think what's really interesting here is there are numerous
5396160	5401440	informants just like bill hamilton had that have told him about installations and facilities and
5401440	5407600	perhaps he can tell those on our project together and relay them because he said some to me in our
5407600	5413120	conversations that he hasn't repeated publicly that are indeed quite interesting also when bill
5413120	5420080	hamilton was still alive dr richard solder talked to him and length about his network of dumps maps
5420080	5426960	so possibly for an hour hour and a half we will dive into that so please look forward to a dr
5426960	5431920	richard solder project coming in the future and please also look forward to the show notes you
5431920	5437280	know uh another thing i'm doing is i'm planning to build a website no sign up needed it's not the
5437280	5442800	dpi archive but i'm planning to uh put up a website where i have videos transcripts of the
5442800	5447200	videos and all research links so i'd like to put those there the only reason i plan to do this is
5447200	5452640	to make it easier to access all the materials i put forth with my research but i want to know
5452640	5457600	what everybody thinks about dumps specifically networks of dumps dumps are not a controversial
5457600	5462160	things dumps do indeed exist and from numerous testimony whether that be lennard stringfield
5462160	5468400	whether that be testimony to solder to hamilton to myself there is a incredible argument that many
5468400	5474080	of these facilities dump facilities engage in uap legacy programs i like to think back to the
5474080	5480720	testimony of ms for example which led to a tremendously fruitful venture into the dump under
5480720	5485520	dugway and of course we even have a specific entrance to that facility other research from other
5485520	5489600	informants can be done on this another thing i did differently in this project of course is i
5489600	5495200	hardly interject when witnesses have spoken to me about testimony or given me testimony i thought
5495200	5501040	it prudent in this investigation just when speaking about various stump facilities and to summarize
5501040	5506240	these include i've spoken to individuals who have been in networks under the antelope valley
5507360	5512960	in location under texas that connected via underground train that went so fast it reminded
5512960	5519520	this army veteran of his fear of flying to white sands missile range as well as the what we might
5519520	5525120	call the deep underground command center out east this is a location deep under the pentagon how
5525120	5531200	deep i don't know however i have good insight this is a facility or at least there are facilities
5531200	5537040	here that are run by the cia directorate of science and technology if that sounds familiar to you
5537040	5542080	that was the cia office that blocked the material transfer in 2008 from lockheed martin to
5542800	5549440	the osap program and that was the 1953 kingman crash but the networks of dumps are what are
5549440	5555280	so interesting to me for example harkening back to the story of ed and the nevada test and training
5555280	5560960	range and edwards air force base there's other testimony about connections in bases in southern
5560960	5568320	california to to area 51 tone upon the nevada test and training range if i could ever get ed
5568320	5572080	to sit down in a room and believe me i've tried to speak to him the first thing i would ask him
5572080	5576640	if there's connective tunneling systems and what type of vehicles if there are that connect these
5576640	5581920	two places now absent in this video of course i talked about in the beginning are the stories of
5581920	5588160	bob lasar the stories of dulcy base and thomas castillo and the story of phil schneider i believe
5588160	5594960	that these in that these witnesses these subjects are very controversial so i didn't include them
5594960	5601040	because of their controversy but because when i have such controversial claims i think it prudent
5601040	5607040	to investigate those and vet those and try to determine any sort of objective information
5607040	5613520	from those when we can so you know s4 for example i do believe s4 is a facility that does indeed exist
5613520	5618000	does it have extraterrestrial or non-human technology i don't know uh an individual i've
5618000	5624400	spoken to that went to s4 talked about colored lines where to walk but he didn't see anything
5624400	5631040	that would say non-human technology but then again he was not privy to the entire base but
5631040	5638800	because of that i would like to focus on subjects like s4 maybe dulcy base um and maybe other locations
5638800	5644160	as well and i will do those in a separate project with this project i wanted to take as objective
5644160	5649440	of an approach as i could i wanted to combine the facts we know about dums about tunnel systems
5649440	5656480	about maglev systems and relay those two stories of the ansolope valley stories of locations out east
5656480	5660240	i mean there is a tremendous amount of facilities i didn't get to cover here that i would like to
5660240	5667040	revisit so again as i spoke about in the project with dr richard solder this is just kind of a taste
5667600	5674640	into dums i do think this is one of the most consequential subjects of of ufo legacy programs
5674640	5680240	you know like i said and i'll say it again most underground facilities as we see from the u.s army
5680240	5687040	corps of engineers and other documents were first proposed as a continuity of government a cog or a
5688320	5693440	icbm silo facility and we know that is partially true in the large fema underground center near
5693440	5697760	denver colorado which everybody knows i'm from colorado so that's near where i am so
5699040	5703200	the clandestine operation when did these start as we talked about the dums there's a good argument
5703200	5708640	that in post 1961 when the u.s army corps of engineers really started to look into underground
5708640	5715520	facilities uh massive ones ranging up to up to in some documents 8 000 feet underground into the
5715520	5720320	late 90s i think this is when the vast majority of underground installations were built when were
5720400	5726320	the connective tunnels built if these do exist which i believe many locations do feature connective
5726320	5730720	tunnels this of course as we saw in the bechtel report with conventional and unconventional
5731280	5738240	tunneling methods probably started around 1974 between 1972 and 1974 a whole host of tunneling
5738240	5744880	committees and institutes were set up to investigate massive tunneling systems and of course
5744960	5750640	following in the 80s into the 90s we see the same thing with maglev technologies so i i think the
5750640	5756480	order of operations here is likely the dumbest built maybe a decade later connective tunnels are
5756480	5761520	built and maybe a decade after that the full train systems are implemented i mean in the 90s we see
5761520	5767520	the national maglev institute and we see corporations like grumman like general dynamics like betel
5768240	5774560	doing aboveboard maglev research so this could likely imply they had been doing clandestine
5774560	5781600	research into similar projects into electromagnetics long before then so it's a it's an incredibly
5781600	5786480	fascinating subject especially when you start to look at the bureau of reclamation and what dr
5786480	5791840	solder has relayed from his informants about the bureau of reclamation this was possibly an
5791840	5797120	aboveboard tunneling system in the american southwest that featured clandestine secondary
5797120	5803920	tunnels to bore out whatever was needed and as we saw in the list i scrolled through there are
5803920	5810160	hundreds of tunnels from the bor that in the mid to late 20th century and some of these are
5810160	5813440	hundreds of miles long some of these are thousands and they range in depths from
5814080	5819120	just underground to up to near a thousand feet so when dr solders informant relates to him that
5819120	5824160	10 men can operate a tbm and a good tbm in good conditions can chew through up to 10 miles per
5824160	5828800	year i do think this is a likely candidate you know this harkens back to other ufo legacy program
5828800	5835520	funding operations how we what we get can make educated guesses via irad sole source contracts
5835520	5843760	id iq and utilizing legitimate contracts to skim off funds for ufo legacy programs now
5844640	5850240	again i want to know what everybody thinks if there are people here who have been to underground
5850240	5854880	facilities massive deep underground facilities please reach out to me i would love to hear
5854880	5861600	about your experience i will respect your anonymity but if you have a location a facility to describe
5861600	5865840	or an experience in such a facility please reach out to me i would love to talk to you but
5866560	5870960	again guys let me know in the comments what you think this has been a long spiel almost 11 minutes
5870960	5875200	i think i've rambled quite a bit please remember to like and subscribe on the video and remember
5875200	5880880	guys i do have a patreon i don't gate keep my content in my opinion this might be stubborn or
5880880	5885760	this might be a bit narcissistic i think the content is important to view so i'm not going to gate
5885760	5890240	keep anything because i would like all of my research all of my projects and all my research
5890240	5895600	materials to be publicly available to anybody so the patreon is there to support what you think
5895600	5902080	the channel is worth not to lock off any content so with that guys i have a couple projects coming
5902080	5906480	up i'm really really really darn excited about i'm trying to think about how i'm going to juggle
5906480	5911200	these but about three projects on the immediate mind i'm already working on including and that
5911200	5916160	includes the project with dr richard solder so i will catch everybody soon and thank you so very
5916160	5920800	much for joining me bye now
