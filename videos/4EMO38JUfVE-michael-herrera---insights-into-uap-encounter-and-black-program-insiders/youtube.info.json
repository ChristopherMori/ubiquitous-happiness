    "description": "Interview with Michael Herrera, USMC veteran and AARO whistleblower. Michael claims to have observed a large, octagonal-shaped UAP operated by a human black ops team while on a human relief mission in Indonesia in 2009. Upon testifying to AARO in April of 2023 and appearing on the Steven Greer National Press Club 2023 Panel in June 2023, Michael claims to have been approached by a UAP crash retrieval insider and taken to a secure facility. \n\nMichael states there are factions within UAP reverse engineering programs, a war between pro-disclosure advocates and a shady cabal who wishes to continue the practice of feudalistic dominance and mastery of NHI technology. \n\nThis interview explores some of the least touched aspects of Michael's testimony including reporting to AARO, fine details of his Indonesia experience, squad leader Nathan and his claims against Michael, what these black program insiders want, and more.\n\nThis interview assumes the viewer has at least some introduction to Michael's story.
