00:00.000 --> 00:05.220
What's going on guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so much for joining me for this in-person

00:05.220 --> 00:09.760
interview with UMC Vet and Arrow whistleblower Michael Herrera.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.020
Before we get into this interview, there's just a couple things I want to touch on.

00:13.020 --> 00:16.980
I co-hosted this interview with my good friend Joey is not my name.

00:16.980 --> 00:21.080
Many of you will remember him from my first video on Michael or have seen him around Reddit

00:21.080 --> 00:25.580
and Twitter as one of the first people to really start investigating Michael's claims

00:25.580 --> 00:29.600
of his experience in 2009 in Indonesia seriously.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.400
When we sat down to conduct this interview, we sought to really ask some of the lesser

00:33.400 --> 00:38.040
asked questions and lesser known details of Michael's encounter in 2009 and his claims

00:38.040 --> 00:40.720
of meeting a Black program insider.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.680
So we do kind of expect you to be somewhat familiar with Michael's story, at least know

00:44.680 --> 00:48.880
the base details of his 2009 experience and his follow-up claims.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.580
If you haven't, I highly recommend checking out my original video on Michael that I did

00:52.580 --> 00:56.520
with Joey or watch his Sean Ryan show podcast appearance.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.240
Both are fantastic videos, I highly recommend checking them out.

00:59.280 --> 01:02.760
If you're not too familiar with Michael's story, if you'll remember back to my Marines

01:02.760 --> 01:07.360
and UFOs video, you'll recall this is the first time I ever covered Michael's story

01:07.360 --> 01:10.720
and I was super dismissive of him, super skeptical.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.760
That's why after all these months of talking to Joey, talking to Michael, sharing meals

01:14.760 --> 01:19.560
with Michael, hosting Joey and conducting this interview, I'm super excited to revisit

01:19.560 --> 01:25.240
this case as it's one I've been privately investigating on my own for quite a while.

01:25.240 --> 01:29.960
So without further ado, please enjoy this interview with Joey is not my name and Michael

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
Herrera.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.280
So you guys get to the top of the hill and of course this is when you observe this object.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.720
Who, which part of your team first observed this?

01:48.720 --> 01:54.680
It had to have been, it wasn't me, it was somebody else and they were more pointing

01:54.680 --> 01:56.480
like, what is that?

01:56.480 --> 02:01.160
And so this was a big misconception for me at first, Joey had to kind of help me visualize

02:01.160 --> 02:04.200
this as I'm sure it was for a lot of other people too.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.320
You guys only saw the top triangular section and some lights of this.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.240
Not really lights, lights didn't happen until the thing actually took off.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.440
But you can see, I mean, if you're going to try to think that these are two trees, right?

02:17.440 --> 02:20.280
And that's kind of like where you can see the top part of it, but then you see the other

02:20.280 --> 02:23.840
part, but you can't make out the whole size of it, right?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.120
Because you have trees and everything distorting it.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.120
So really only we saw was something changing colors often this little thing that I had

02:30.120 --> 02:33.120
visual on and you see it moving around.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.000
It's like, it's not a building.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.920
I mean, we thought it was a building at a point, but I mean, it's just off in the distance

02:38.920 --> 02:44.520
right there and it's changing colors and something that you have green vegetation sticks out like

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
a sore thumb.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.720
It's easier to say if it was a building because I mean, you'd expect kind of buildings to

02:48.720 --> 02:52.560
be in that area, but this area didn't have any of those buildings, didn't have anything

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
like that.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.800
So who made the decision to kind of go forward and check this out?

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
It wasn't me.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.880
And it was the person in charge and that's who was the one that did that.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.800
As you approach the object, you could only still see just above the tree line, the top

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
of the object.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
You could see the whole thing.

03:07.800 --> 03:13.480
Yeah, so when we got down that hill and it was something we weren't allowed to do obviously

03:13.480 --> 03:17.680
because you're not supposed to abandon your, whatever your post is.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.320
Yeah, I'm curious about that.

03:19.320 --> 03:27.120
Can you describe what was going on at the LZ at the time where you guys decided, I mean,

03:27.120 --> 03:32.720
to make this decision, this risky decision to go and check out whatever this was?

03:32.720 --> 03:35.240
So I don't remember much going on at the LZ.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.400
I just remember taking video of that helicopter that was off in the distance.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.040
It wasn't like it was super close.

03:40.040 --> 03:46.280
Did you guys feel like that helicopter was part of your responsibility to guard or was

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
it like?

03:47.280 --> 03:50.920
I just assumed that there probably was other people there or probably other Marines on

03:50.920 --> 03:53.560
board that they were probably dropping off in that area.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.280
That would be my assumption.

03:55.280 --> 04:01.400
I don't remember thinking anything like that back then, you know, 14, 15 years ago.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.640
Yeah, I mean, I can imagine, you know, whatever you guys saw.

04:05.640 --> 04:11.320
Well, something that wasn't, it was abnormal and, you know, yeah, curiosity is a good thing

04:11.320 --> 04:12.320
to an extent.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.560
But I tell people all the time, curiosity is what kills a cat.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.520
And it's something in this way that it changed our lives.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.960
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't a light decision.

04:20.960 --> 04:26.640
It was a risky decision and you guys made the choice and, I mean, we didn't even rack

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
around in the chamber.

04:27.640 --> 04:33.040
It's just like we weren't expecting to really get into anything like that.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.120
You know, it was just walking down, trying to see what that is.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.560
And then if it wasn't nothing, we're just going to go back up the hill and resume to

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
what we were doing.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.480
And obviously it led to what we experienced.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.080
When you're walking, you know, you guys are at the top of the hill.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.360
The decision is made to go check this thing out.

04:49.360 --> 04:54.120
And at the top of the hill, you don't actually see any people.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.160
You didn't see those, the trucks yet.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.240
You're just seeing the top of the craft.

04:59.240 --> 05:04.480
So you guys go down the moment of interception with these guys.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.840
Can you describe?

05:07.840 --> 05:14.760
I think, I think what gets lost on a lot of people is how fast it happened and how quickly

05:14.760 --> 05:16.840
they took control of the situation.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.320
I mean, what was your first impression when you saw these guys?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.800
Well, I heard people yelling at us.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.000
That's what got my attention.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
And when we saw weapons in their hands pointed at us, you're not going to move, you're not

05:28.000 --> 05:31.320
going to raise your weapon up because obviously that's the point.

05:31.320 --> 05:35.360
And then obviously, and during the briefing, I had touched on in numerous interviews that

05:35.360 --> 05:39.680
there was a possible SEAL team that was out there trying to handle things that they were

05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
tasked on.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.640
What they were specifically doing, I don't know.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.520
But I remember in the ward room that that's what they were talking about, having some

05:45.520 --> 05:49.480
sort of element of US Navy SEALs there.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.800
And for a second, we thought it may have been them and we're just like, oh, shit, here's

05:52.800 --> 05:53.800
these guys.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.800
You know, they don't, then obviously we were going to talk or something or just go, but

05:57.800 --> 06:03.100
these guys were not, these guys were not carrying themselves as SEALs and they didn't have anything

06:03.100 --> 06:04.960
identifying on them.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.000
And obviously they were screaming at us, telling us to put our weapons, you know, put our hands

06:09.000 --> 06:11.780
up in the air because we had slings on our stuff, right?

06:11.780 --> 06:15.760
So that's when we're putting our hands up in the air and every single one of us did the

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
same thing.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.840
It's not like, I mean, how are we going to raise a weapon that doesn't even have a full

06:19.840 --> 06:20.840
chamber?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.480
What are you going to do at that point?

06:22.480 --> 06:26.560
If you even rack that round and try to bring it up, they've already got their muzzles pointed

06:26.560 --> 06:27.720
at you.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.160
It's almost like a police officer coming up to your vehicle when they do a traffic stop

06:32.360 --> 06:36.160
and they feel threatened or they may have an indication that your vehicle matches the

06:36.160 --> 06:40.040
description of somebody who has had a gun pointed at them, for example, where they would

06:40.040 --> 06:43.380
believe that it's reasonable suspicion for them to deploy their firearm.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.960
Are you going to move suddenly and make him think you're going to reach for something

06:46.960 --> 06:48.400
and he just blasts you?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.400
No.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.640
And how did these men approach you in a tactical column, a pincer?

06:52.640 --> 06:54.440
We were the one that was in a tactical column.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.520
They had, so if I was looking at this and we kind of started, and that's when we naturally

06:59.520 --> 07:04.680
kind of spread out like walking towards them, and that's when they basically had four guys

07:04.680 --> 07:08.520
on this side and they have four guys on this side.

07:08.520 --> 07:13.040
And I talked to numerous special operators about this type of tactic and they called

07:13.040 --> 07:18.200
a nosebleed, which is where they have basically interlocking fields of fire with this direction

07:18.200 --> 07:19.200
on one target.

07:19.200 --> 07:27.480
It's a very rookie, easy thing to do and these guys, they already had that position.

07:27.480 --> 07:31.360
So it tells me that maybe there could have been more operators that were around that

07:31.360 --> 07:35.500
area, maybe on the other side of the craft, on the other side of where the trucks may

07:35.500 --> 07:40.000
have went off, which I didn't see them go off anywhere.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
But from what I've been told, there was more than just those guys there.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.280
So if we would have gotten into any kind of conflict, we were severely outnumbered already.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.300
At what point did the craft become fully visible?

07:52.300 --> 07:55.920
When we got to the bottom of the hill and we walked a little bit forward and it started

07:55.920 --> 07:57.400
to clear out.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.080
And that's when this thing was just sitting there.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.640
And then the men approached you right after you noticed it?

08:01.640 --> 08:02.640
Correct.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.320
As soon as we broke that threshold of getting into that clearing is where they basically

08:05.320 --> 08:06.520
had us intercepted.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.920
It's not like we could run behind anything because you can't.

08:09.920 --> 08:10.920
Right.

08:10.920 --> 08:15.480
And the trees weren't like big red oak trees where you could hide behind.

08:15.480 --> 08:22.120
I remember the trees probably being as big as this water bottle, at least how thick,

08:22.120 --> 08:25.160
probably a little bit thicker, but that's not enough to stop anything.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.840
It's not enough to hide behind and not get hit.

08:28.840 --> 08:34.160
So everybody has the whole, they think they're John Wick until they're in that situation,

08:34.160 --> 08:37.120
but it's like I would like to see anybody else in that situation to see what they would

08:37.120 --> 08:38.120
have done.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.640
Because knowing what type of operators we encountered now that I've already been through

08:41.640 --> 08:47.880
all of this, been briefed on it, been included to an extent, none of us would have been a

08:47.880 --> 08:50.280
match for those guys.

08:50.280 --> 08:54.160
And so what did these men do as they trained the rifles on you as they approached you?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.760
So they were pointed, they were screaming at us.

08:56.760 --> 09:02.080
You could actually hear them flip everything off safe because it's not a bull click.

09:02.080 --> 09:06.120
And where we were at, obviously, there's not a lot of noise coming from the hill obviously

09:06.120 --> 09:10.120
because everything that's going on over there is basically silent because you have a hill

09:10.120 --> 09:11.560
blocking everything.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.320
And then the craft's not emitting any kind of noise except for that little hum or that

09:15.320 --> 09:16.320
guitar amp.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.960
I mean, it's not exactly like a guitar amp or like a transformer, but something similar

09:19.960 --> 09:20.960
to that.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.120
You actually replicated pretty good to an extent.

09:24.120 --> 09:29.480
So and that wasn't as audible compared to when everything started to go on and when

09:29.480 --> 09:34.480
they had us, because we weren't at the, where we just broke that threshold, right?

09:34.480 --> 09:38.280
We actually pulled up a little bit more as they were telling us to.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.840
And so they had their weapons on every single one of us.

09:41.840 --> 09:46.160
And there was only six of us, there was eight of them, which means that it's easy for them

09:46.160 --> 09:49.760
just to, I mean, I don't even know if their weapons are full auto.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.280
And they probably could be.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.280
There's or not, there are only three round bursts or semi-automatic and most of the time

09:54.280 --> 09:59.200
they teach us to shoot in a semi-automatic, you know, one round per person, a kill shot

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
at least.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.200
So, I mean, it's not a head shot.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.800
I mean, you have a T-Box and what you're trained for combat marksmanship, but these guys could

10:04.800 --> 10:07.680
have full automatic M4s.

10:07.680 --> 10:12.080
I wouldn't have rolled it out, you know, which means that they just need to, each person

10:12.080 --> 10:15.520
doing a couple round bursts, three to five round bursts, I mean, it's going to get everybody

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
where we were at.

10:16.960 --> 10:24.320
Now, one thing that people bring up is, you know, you did have, you had your camera,

10:24.320 --> 10:28.560
at the top of the hill, you actually got some pictures of what you guys were seeing.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.280
I remember at least a couple of photographs, but I remember a video as well.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.280
That's right.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.920
I remember a video and that's when I had a dump pouch, which all of us did have a dump

10:35.920 --> 10:41.280
pouch, but I had it right here all the time and that's where we basically put expended

10:41.280 --> 10:44.560
magazines because you're not going to drop them because you have to reuse them.

10:44.560 --> 10:50.720
So it also helped, too, if you had carry extra ammo because if you had some malfunction

10:50.720 --> 10:56.640
or sometimes we use the saws with, because my had regular saw drum pouches on my stuff,

10:56.640 --> 11:01.120
where I could put a drum here and a drum here and then I had grenade pouches up here.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.440
And most of the time, I would just put magazines and whatever the easiest side to reach was

11:05.440 --> 11:06.840
and that's basically what I had.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.920
So we didn't have like M4 or M16 pouches.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.640
I had saw drum pouches where I had all the mags in, which we had a combat load, six mags.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.640
They disarmed you, right?

11:18.640 --> 11:19.640
Yes.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.240
That was kind of their first, like once they approached you, you described how they were

11:24.240 --> 11:27.200
very methodical and how they did that.

11:27.200 --> 11:31.920
They wanted to gain control of the situation, which they had that control, right, but they're

11:31.920 --> 11:36.680
going to sleep better because they took our weapons from us and slung them and going through

11:36.680 --> 11:38.800
making sure that we had our magazines out.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.640
It wasn't like they were spending us like some law enforcement officer checking you,

11:42.640 --> 11:44.800
tracking around your ankles, anything like that.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.960
They're not doing that.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.480
The only thing that they searched us with was our military IDs where they knew they were

11:49.480 --> 11:53.920
at, which is what my suspicion was that these guys were former military at some point because

11:53.920 --> 11:56.560
they knew exactly where our IDs were.

11:56.560 --> 12:00.320
And you said they interacted with your IDs with something that what we would recognize

12:00.320 --> 12:01.840
today as a modern day smartphone.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Yes.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.520
So they had something that I referred to as a bat system that we were trained on, which

12:05.520 --> 12:08.000
is like a biometrics and tracking system.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.400
It could be the acronym for it, but I just remember saying bats.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.260
And they tried that first.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.080
So they put that away and they had these things.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.040
I mean, it wasn't like, because iPhones were kind of bulky back in the day and they had

12:19.040 --> 12:24.560
blackberries and I had a Sony Ericsson MP3 phone that was pretty bulky.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.160
And they had something that was really thin.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.440
And that's what they were using.

12:29.440 --> 12:35.160
So it could have been something that was comparable, but then again, I don't know.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.240
So while you're getting searched, the craft is in the background.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.680
For anybody that hasn't heard you describe this craft, can you tell us what it looks

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
like?

12:41.680 --> 12:48.680
So I remember as, because there was corners, which means to me it was an octagonal shape.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.640
Actually, could you, would you mind drawing it for us?

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Let's see.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
I got pens over here.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
Let me, yeah, let's...

12:54.640 --> 12:56.200
I like that idea.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.200
That would be cool.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
And you know what?

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
I'm going to move.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.200
All right.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.880
So what did this thing, what did this craft look like?

13:03.880 --> 13:04.880
Okay.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.960
So this is going from our point of view, right?

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
That I can remember.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
So I'm just going to say this is like vegetation, right?

13:09.960 --> 13:12.680
And this is to represent that clearing.

13:12.680 --> 13:17.160
What I remember is kind of like a pyramid shape at the top like this, because I remember

13:17.160 --> 13:22.280
seeing some shading and some were kind of brighter than others.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.280
Like this.

13:23.280 --> 13:30.440
Then I remember it doing like this and then it had corners, right?

13:30.440 --> 13:34.080
This may be looking a little bit strange, but this is just a rough draft.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.400
It used to be a better artist back in the day.

13:36.400 --> 13:41.360
And I remember seeing these vents, at least that's what it looks like on each of the corners

13:41.360 --> 13:42.360
like this.

13:42.360 --> 13:51.080
So there's a vent here, and it was like it was positioned on the lines, like this.

13:51.080 --> 13:57.960
And then on each corner, when this thing took off, it had lights that would pop on, which

13:57.960 --> 14:01.800
would have been like red, yellow, green, and blue are the only ones I remember that kind

14:01.800 --> 14:04.400
of had a line that went like this.

14:04.400 --> 14:13.240
And it had some sort of scale pattern that I estimate is octagonal, but it could honestly

14:13.240 --> 14:16.080
be circular, it could be square.

14:16.080 --> 14:24.280
I wasn't close enough to depict it, but this is where this was the blackest, darkest thing

14:24.280 --> 14:25.960
that I have ever seen in my life.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.000
It's almost like light got absorbed into this, and I don't know if this is just because

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
of the craft.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.560
It may help with a function, but there's probably third graders or something that say they can

14:38.560 --> 14:42.400
probably do a better job than this, and I'd probably agree with them.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.040
So now what about the platform?

14:45.040 --> 14:49.200
Platform underneath was kind of like it was raised like this, not off the ground, but

14:49.200 --> 14:50.440
just like an incline.

14:50.760 --> 14:56.920
And it went underneath like this, and it was around the same kind of length as a craft,

14:56.920 --> 15:03.360
and it had kind of some points on it as well, which obviously it fits under the craft when

15:03.360 --> 15:04.840
we saw that happen.

15:04.840 --> 15:11.120
And it wasn't like where we were at, I would say this is approximately even the same distance

15:11.120 --> 15:11.920
as it was.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.240
There was not like there was any light or materials on here that I remember seeing.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.680
But then you have, I'm going to draw stick figures.

15:19.800 --> 15:23.240
So I'm just going to draw them black, because these are black team guys.

15:23.240 --> 15:35.480
I know this is not a van Gogh or a Mona Lisa drawer, but I'm just trying to gather everybody's

15:35.480 --> 15:40.960
attention to see how, what I can recall as this and all these guys, and we were essentially

15:40.960 --> 15:46.800
in this area kind of online, four, five, six, right?

15:46.800 --> 15:53.480
We weren't like evenly spaced out, but you guys can kind of see how there's six of us,

15:53.480 --> 15:55.680
there's eight of them, they've got good field of view.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.360
We can see this going on the background, and I'm going to draw a line through this, but

16:00.360 --> 16:04.520
basically where the directions or the trucks came from were from our left.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.360
So they're coming up and then they would go like this.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.840
I don't remember seeing them go off the platform and going somewhere else.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.960
I just remember them going on here, but then we're also facing the fact that we're dealing

16:15.960 --> 16:17.920
with these guys at the same time.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.080
So our focus is going back and forth.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.000
One, you don't see anything that looks like that ever.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.680
Two, you're not in a situation where that happens either.

16:27.680 --> 16:35.320
So as I wish there was more details that I can remember aside from that, but that is

16:35.320 --> 16:38.800
what I briefly recall as far as what the craft looked like.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.760
Besides changing colors from a light matte gray to a dark matte black, the whole thing.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.680
And so before this craft took off, what did this platform do?

16:46.680 --> 16:50.880
So this craft kind of sunk down a little bit like this.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.000
This platform itself raised up.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.880
And there were trucks and other crates?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.600
I don't remember seeing the trucks.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.840
They could have been because where we were at, and mind you, I didn't see it as it started

17:00.840 --> 17:02.640
going up.

17:02.640 --> 17:08.600
I saw it when we were going back and forth, and the only thing that got my attention and

17:08.600 --> 17:12.520
I'm sure it got everybody else's attention, and I'm only speaking from my point of view

17:12.520 --> 17:16.480
was the only thing that got my attention was something was moving.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.120
And because your eyes are used to attract movement, right?

17:19.120 --> 17:20.900
It's just something that gets your attention.

17:20.900 --> 17:27.600
So when I saw that raising up, it was already, what I'd estimate, over R, if we're only

17:27.600 --> 17:32.200
5, 10 to 6 feet tall, it was probably almost 10 feet off the ground.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.920
Did it raise rapidly or in kind of a slow motion?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.120
Not super rapid.

17:36.120 --> 17:41.360
It was enough to kind of be slow, but still enough to where you could catch it.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.840
I don't remember seeing any kind of containers going up with it or trucks or nothing.

17:46.840 --> 17:51.760
I just remember seeing the front profile, the truck, with a trailer behind it, and that

17:51.760 --> 17:55.320
was why I was able to see that cylinder in front of that container.

17:55.320 --> 18:00.000
Let's get another piece of paper and draw the trucks.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.800
And actually, I want to show you this too.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.000
That drawing is going to be worth a lot of money someday.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Keep that.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Let me do this.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh, get the signature.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Cool.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.840
This is probably my favorite part of the interview.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.840
You drawing this stuff?

18:14.840 --> 18:15.840
It's awesome.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.840
I feel like I'm in kindergarten right now.

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
Showing off your colors.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.840
It shapes that you recognize.

18:18.840 --> 18:28.560
But it's cool because it helps you kind of describe, as you're doing it, you know.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.320
All right, so, all right, trucks.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.080
All right, so what are these trucks, the containers with them?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.320
Could you describe those?

18:36.320 --> 18:37.320
Yeah.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.240
Like I said, I only saw it from certain profiles.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.760
And what I remember distinctly with these, I don't remember seeing like a Ford logo or

18:43.760 --> 18:47.240
nothing like a Chevy Duramax on the hood or nothing like that.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.520
We obviously were kind of far away in comparison to that.

18:50.520 --> 18:56.360
So I'm going to draw three different views or profiles, which I remember seeing these

18:56.360 --> 18:57.360
trucks.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.960
So the first one's going to be as if it was coming towards us.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.800
So there's going to be like a headlight here.

19:03.800 --> 19:09.040
There's like a grill, right, a bumper.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.440
And I had like a, I remember having like kind of like a hitch is what I'm assuming.

19:13.440 --> 19:19.720
And then, there's another headlight here.

19:19.720 --> 19:30.680
Again, I'm going to apologize ahead of time that this isn't going to be, I remember seeing.

19:30.680 --> 19:37.320
Now, when you say you didn't see logos, like you didn't see Ford or Chevy, but you stated

19:37.320 --> 19:41.360
what kind of trucks they were, though, recognize the body style.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.360
Yeah.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.080
And I would say that their Ford F 350s is what I would assume they were.

19:46.080 --> 19:51.480
Did you just say that Uncigno was black dollar or gotcha?

19:51.480 --> 19:57.880
What I do recall seeing is I had like these things on the sides here, kind of like vents,

19:57.880 --> 19:59.920
but they're not really vents.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.840
And it's kind of remind me of what they had on military hummers for night vision.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.040
So that's kind of what they had on there, which tells me that they run these at night

20:09.040 --> 20:10.560
time as well.

20:10.560 --> 20:15.640
And these were like big, aggressive off-road tires, right?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.840
Truck bed, okay.

20:17.840 --> 20:24.160
You can kind of see these cases, which are Pelican cases on the back.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.560
And what are Pelican cases for anybody who doesn't know?

20:26.560 --> 20:32.440
I mean, it's a brand, but these are weapons, because we had the same ones that we transport

20:32.440 --> 20:33.440
weapons with.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.440
And that's just...

20:34.440 --> 20:35.840
Do they carry small arms, munitions?

20:35.840 --> 20:38.240
Yeah, stuff like that.

20:38.240 --> 20:47.120
So then this was hooked to a trailer that had four wheels like this, okay, trailer.

20:47.120 --> 20:56.320
And the only thing I remember seeing of this container, I had the ridges kind of like

20:56.320 --> 20:58.560
a shipping container, but not much.

20:58.560 --> 21:04.600
I had the cylinder that's kind of on the front right here.

21:04.600 --> 21:10.400
So I wanted to show you this.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.440
Let me just throw this right in front of that, so that camera gets it.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.640
What do you think of that?

21:16.640 --> 21:19.120
Looks identical, but then again...

21:19.120 --> 21:21.960
Now, the other thing...

21:21.960 --> 21:26.240
I remember seeing it having four or two tires on each side, right?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.720
So a dual axle, yep.

21:28.720 --> 21:36.840
So this was another thing I found where they actually have the Connex box on top of it.

21:36.840 --> 21:42.280
With more aggressive tires, but this looks shockingly familiar.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.280
Because that's like the type of...

21:44.280 --> 21:45.880
I mean, that's a shipping crate, you know?

21:45.880 --> 21:50.680
I think this is called a TriCon configuration, so they're all standardized, like the sizes

21:50.680 --> 21:52.960
and stuff.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
And these were outfitted.

21:53.960 --> 21:59.360
They had these cylinders on the front right here that would come to find out it's actually

21:59.360 --> 22:00.360
oxygen supply.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
Yeah.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.840
So draw those cylinders.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.840
Okay.

22:03.840 --> 22:09.640
So I'm going to black it out completely because the cylinder itself was black, and that's why...

22:09.640 --> 22:13.760
And initially, when you saw this, you hypothesized this might be humidity control for something

22:13.760 --> 22:14.760
like drugs.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.760
Or drugs, right?

22:15.760 --> 22:19.960
That's what I testified to Aaron with, because I didn't think it was people.

22:19.960 --> 22:24.120
That was in my thought process at the time.

22:24.120 --> 22:28.160
And we'll talk about Aero in a little bit, but so you testified to Aero before you did

22:28.160 --> 22:29.960
the NPC in June of 2023.

22:29.960 --> 22:30.960
Yes.

22:30.960 --> 22:31.960
Okay.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.960
Yep.

22:32.960 --> 22:33.960
That was...

22:33.960 --> 22:35.800
I had testified last year to Aero.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
It was late April.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
Okay.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
Late April, 2023.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
Okay.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
Late April, 2023.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
Yep.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.800
All right.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.400
So that's kind of the view that...

22:46.400 --> 22:48.840
That's really good.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.800
So and then obviously the side view...

22:51.800 --> 22:55.320
So cylinders basically spanning the whole width of the container.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.320
Yeah.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.320
Correct.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.320
It wasn't like a small one.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.320
It was just a whole width.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.320
Correct.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.320
All right.

23:01.320 --> 23:05.320
So here's where the tires would be from the side profile of that trailer.

23:05.320 --> 23:09.760
Of course, there was no white wheel as it was all black.

23:09.760 --> 23:14.840
I remember seeing kind of the back.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
Okay.

23:16.840 --> 23:25.440
And then this container right here.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.160
This is the cylinder from a side view.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.160
Okay.

23:29.160 --> 23:33.080
Truck bed right here.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.120
How many trucks total do you remember seeing?

23:35.120 --> 23:36.120
Four.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.120
Four.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.840
And did each one also have weapons crates or just...

23:38.840 --> 23:39.840
Yes.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
Each one of them had these...

23:40.840 --> 23:42.520
What you would call pelican cases.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.520
Okay.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.800
But just weapons cases is what they definitely look like.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.360
Were the cases opened, closed?

23:48.360 --> 23:49.360
Closed.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.360
Okay.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.600
And the windows are remember being kind of dark.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
So...

23:57.600 --> 24:02.400
Could you recall any other operators or people in the trucks besides just the drivers?

24:02.400 --> 24:07.800
I remember one truck that went on the platform and now the door, at least some of the doors

24:07.800 --> 24:08.800
open.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.800
I can't recall.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.400
Were there any people standing on the platforms?

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
Yeah.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.720
I don't remember.

24:14.720 --> 24:20.020
But I don't remember seeing people on the platforms.

24:20.020 --> 24:21.020
So that is kind of...

24:21.020 --> 24:22.920
And these are black, of course, right?

24:22.920 --> 24:28.120
So that's a side view of what that is, right?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.120
Okay.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.840
Which, I mean, obviously these were black, the shipping container was black, everything

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
like that.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.000
The other profile I'm going to draw is going to be from the rear.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.440
Did each truck have a shipping container attached to it?

24:39.440 --> 24:40.440
Yes.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.440
Okay.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.280
So here's a container right here.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.480
I don't remember seeing the bars.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.480
Hatch doors on the back.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.480
Yep.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.480
Like this.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
Okay.

24:48.480 --> 24:58.720
Can't really see the cylinder at this point, but I'll just indicate it being there.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.280
You also said that they were up armored?

25:02.280 --> 25:03.280
Yeah.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.280
I mean, it's so...

25:04.280 --> 25:05.520
What did you mean by that?

25:05.520 --> 25:09.200
So they looked a little beefier, thicker material, you know what I mean?

25:09.200 --> 25:11.360
Like they look like they'd be bullet resistant.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.360
Okay.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.080
You can see a regular truck and they're kind of like, okay, it's a regular truck, but these

25:16.080 --> 25:17.800
look like they were reinforced.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.880
Kind of like a secret service car?

25:19.880 --> 25:22.440
Yeah, to an extent, but...

25:22.440 --> 25:23.440
Okay.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.440
All right.

25:24.440 --> 25:31.640
So there's a container like that, which we're not elevated, but this is just to put perspective

25:31.640 --> 25:38.640
of the truck and just so how we were seeing it from the back.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.280
That's the only views that I remember seeing these trucks.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.360
Because you were in front of the craft and they kind of came out in a little bit of a

25:45.360 --> 25:46.360
circle.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.840
The left side like this and then went up that direction.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.840
Okay.

25:48.840 --> 25:49.840
It wasn't like they went straight.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.480
They were going up to that platform.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.480
Okay.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.480
So you see the craft.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.480
You're basically getting weapons checked, weapons stripped from this team.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.720
What happens then?

25:57.720 --> 25:59.720
So they're going through each of us, taking our stuff.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.880
They take our magazines out of our pouches and they kick them off.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.680
They got one guy off in a distance that I remember was a standoff distance, like more

26:06.680 --> 26:07.840
than 10 feet.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.120
So obviously we tried to run and grab our stuff and he's just going to light this up

26:11.120 --> 26:12.120
if he wanted to.

26:12.160 --> 26:15.200
They had a different rifle platform to the main guys.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.200
So same load out with all of them.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.200
They all had the same stuff.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.200
Yeah.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.680
They had the same kind of, I mean they may have different attachments, but I remember

26:20.680 --> 26:26.960
most of the parts seeing ACOGs on each one of them with the PEC-16 illuminators on those.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.040
Those is what I remember seeing.

26:29.040 --> 26:35.320
One thing I've always been curious about, did you notice any of them like talking on

26:35.320 --> 26:36.320
the radio to someone?

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
One guy had a radio and I don't remember him talking to anybody.

26:38.320 --> 26:43.280
I just remember seeing it and with the antenna coming up that he had pressed to his vest.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.240
But he was the main guy that was kind of telling people what to do.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.960
And he was mainly the one besides another guy that was, you know, and shit, it was like

26:50.960 --> 26:51.960
he will fucking kill you.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.400
You know, it's easy to get lost out here, etc.

26:54.400 --> 27:01.360
Did it seem like, you know, when they intercepted you guys, obviously there were other guys

27:01.360 --> 27:07.840
in the trucks doing their thing, did you have the impression that like all of a sudden there

27:07.840 --> 27:10.360
were like, oh shit, we need to wrap this up and get out?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.880
Or were they kind of just not really even caring about what was going on?

27:12.880 --> 27:16.400
I don't think they were kind of caring was they may have not even saw what was going

27:16.400 --> 27:17.400
on.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
They could have.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.400
I mean, I don't know that speculation at this point.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.480
Yeah, clearly we're getting into speculation there.

27:24.480 --> 27:30.320
But yeah, I'm just, it's like I also think about the fact that this, you know, the earthquake,

27:30.320 --> 27:33.840
you know, the whole reason this operation was there was because there was an earthquake

27:33.840 --> 27:40.080
on it was the end of or the first of September or end of October.

27:40.080 --> 27:45.760
It was the end of September and then I think it was September 30th, if I'm not mistaken.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
Don't quote me on that.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.760
Yeah.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.760
Yeah.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.760
No, I think that's I think that's correct.

27:49.760 --> 27:55.480
So and then, you know, the Denver shows up on the ninth.

27:55.480 --> 28:01.280
So we're, you know, nine, 10 days after the initial earthquake and, you know, just, you

28:01.280 --> 28:06.320
know, obviously speculation here, but it's like, it kind of seems weird that why would

28:06.320 --> 28:11.480
this operation be occurring nine days after the earthquake?

28:11.480 --> 28:16.080
You know, of course, afterwards you've kind of been told like what that operation was

28:16.080 --> 28:23.160
all about and, you know, recruiting people in disaster or struck in areas.

28:23.160 --> 28:27.640
But who's to say that was like maybe they had been conducting those same operations

28:27.640 --> 28:28.640
all week long.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.800
They could have been.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.800
They could have been.

28:31.160 --> 28:35.840
And believe me, those are some questions I've asked some of these gentlemen that I'm working

28:35.840 --> 28:40.040
with and they, you know, they don't know because everything's compartmentalized.

28:40.040 --> 28:44.120
I'm hoping one day maybe one of them that I come across does know because I'm going

28:44.120 --> 28:50.680
to ask him a lot of questions because I mean, I mean, just like anybody listening or watching

28:50.680 --> 28:55.120
to this or anybody who wants this to come out and come forward, I'm a hundred percent

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
with them.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.800
I want this to come full circle just like anybody else.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.480
I'm just as impatient.

28:59.480 --> 29:04.360
The only difference that separates me from anybody else is the experience, but also having

29:04.360 --> 29:08.080
knowledge of what's going on to an extent, at least with what I've been exposed to.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.560
I just have a little bit more information.

29:10.560 --> 29:14.440
So you get to the point, you know, they're threatening you, they give you your weapons

29:14.440 --> 29:20.960
back and tell you to go, you know, back, back up the hill, don't go back.

29:20.960 --> 29:27.040
When you get to the top of the hill, what do you see happening at the LZ?

29:27.040 --> 29:32.760
I just remember me because I remember once we broke the top and all of a sudden I remember

29:32.760 --> 29:34.680
seeing some of our guys just start running.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.720
So I'm following suit with them, right?

29:36.720 --> 29:40.280
Because if anything's going to happen to us, it's going to get the attention of everybody

29:40.280 --> 29:41.640
else.

29:41.640 --> 29:47.480
And I remember seeing some people, but it wasn't like it was like close up.

29:47.480 --> 29:52.080
I just remember when we ran back, we had our weapons strapped to our back that were very

29:52.080 --> 29:55.240
tight, uncomfortably tight, right?

29:55.240 --> 29:57.760
Because it's compressing your vest.

29:57.760 --> 30:02.760
And remember having a gash on my right part of my neck because we had like a yoke or like

30:02.760 --> 30:03.880
a collar on our vest.

30:03.880 --> 30:08.840
And I remember that when they put that through that it actually kind of the slings we had

30:08.840 --> 30:12.640
weren't the best quality and they're not soft.

30:12.640 --> 30:18.040
They're plastic and polymer, whatever it is or cloth, whatever material they make out of

30:18.040 --> 30:19.040
them and it's very hard.

30:19.040 --> 30:22.160
So it kind of cuts you up a little bit.

30:22.160 --> 30:27.640
And then I remember us getting back there and I remember seeing a couple people off in

30:27.640 --> 30:31.960
the distance as far as some villagers or whoever the civilians were.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.600
And there was some other military personnel.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.120
I don't remember them being Marines.

30:37.120 --> 30:43.080
I don't remember what, they may have been the Indonesian military could have been there,

30:43.080 --> 30:47.000
but they were still off kind of at a distance compared to where we were at.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.500
And there was this gunnery sergeant that was there and I've never seen this guy before.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.120
I don't know if he was attached to the ship.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.480
I don't know if he was brought by any other means.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.880
I have never seen this guy before.

30:56.880 --> 31:02.120
Now gunnery sergeant, you recognize it because you see his rank, right?

31:02.120 --> 31:08.400
Now gunnery sergeant, that rank is specific to the Marines, isn't it?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
Correct.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.800
Okay, so when you speculate that maybe he was assigned to the ship or attached to the

31:13.800 --> 31:16.240
ship I think you kind of say, what do you mean by that?

31:16.480 --> 31:24.760
So each ship, if they're, from my understanding, again, I don't know 100%, but from my understanding

31:24.760 --> 31:30.680
there are some ships that have like a combat loading group or somebody who's basically

31:30.680 --> 31:32.920
loading Marine stuff onto a ship.

31:32.920 --> 31:36.680
I don't know the specific, I can't remember what it's called.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.800
They also have some Marines that are red patches.

31:38.800 --> 31:44.880
They have a red patch on their cover and then they have red patches on some of their blouse.

31:44.880 --> 31:49.800
They have some on their shoulder pocket and some on their cargo pockets.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.480
And this guy didn't have those.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.040
I thought I can recall anyway.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.720
He may have, he may not have, I don't remember.

31:56.720 --> 32:01.760
But I remember this rank because obviously it was a little hard to see it because woodlands

32:01.760 --> 32:05.920
have black shapes and sometimes it distorts that and if you end up calling somebody by

32:05.920 --> 32:10.160
the wrong rank you get to pay for it with pushups or get screamed at, right?

32:10.160 --> 32:14.320
So which honestly, if I was in that position I would have screamed at people and tried

32:14.320 --> 32:17.160
to fuck with them too for getting my rank wrong.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.080
So it happens.

32:19.080 --> 32:27.440
But when you ran back to the LZ, you were running towards the helicopter?

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
No.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.440
Okay.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.440
The helicopter was not there yet.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.440
Okay.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.440
So what's back?

32:32.440 --> 32:37.800
He had a radio that he was talking with and he was communicating with whatever the pilots

32:37.800 --> 32:39.960
or whoever it was.

32:39.960 --> 32:44.920
So what happened when we got there, he kind of like, first of all, for security, why do

32:44.920 --> 32:47.160
we have our weapons slung on our back?

32:47.160 --> 32:48.160
That's out of place.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.080
No Marines going to have that going on.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.120
And that's what I think he was mainly more upset with was because that we were supposed

32:55.120 --> 33:01.440
to be our weapons proper, no magazines in, you know, which obviously they put our stuff

33:01.440 --> 33:04.440
in, but they put it into where it'd be very inconvenient to try to load it up and then

33:04.440 --> 33:06.320
go deal with it.

33:06.320 --> 33:11.760
So I think that, thinking back to that, I think that that's mainly why he was upset

33:11.760 --> 33:17.880
was because, okay, well, you guys look fucked up is mainly what I would assume, right?

33:17.880 --> 33:20.240
I'm just speculating at that point.

33:20.240 --> 33:27.600
But I remember us stepping off to the side, off in a distance a little bit, and we're

33:27.600 --> 33:29.320
basically squaring ourselves up.

33:29.320 --> 33:34.280
We're taking our weapons off of each other, giving it to us, putting a magazine in and

33:34.280 --> 33:37.520
having to resume the normal carry.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.920
And so this gunnery sergeant is standing just in the clearing where the LZ where you guys

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
were dropped off.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.920
Correct.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.040
Was he surrounded by a platoon of Marines or was it just this gunnery sergeant?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.040
Just him.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.040
And other people off in the distance.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.040
And other people off in the distance.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.280
So they may have linked up and then he probably told them to go away or whatever he was doing.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.720
I have no clue.

33:53.720 --> 33:58.800
And then because he was on the radio, that's when CH-53 came in and picked everybody up.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.880
Now on this CH-53, did you recognize the pilot?

34:01.880 --> 34:03.920
Was this the same helicopter that dropped you off?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.480
I don't recall any of that.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.920
I just remember seeing the CH-53 and that's when it landed and we just boarded up on that

34:09.920 --> 34:10.920
thing.

34:10.920 --> 34:11.920
I don't remember.

34:11.920 --> 34:16.080
I mean, obviously our point of view, I don't remember looking at a pilot I never had a

34:16.080 --> 34:17.920
chance to and it's the same thing with this.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.480
I don't know specifically who was flying or what.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.840
And so nobody said to the gunnery sergeant, what you guys just experienced?

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
No.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
Okay.

34:25.840 --> 34:30.560
So you came to the LZ, you got off the helicopter, that helicopter left, you go to the top at

34:30.560 --> 34:37.680
a certain point, a second helicopter comes at a different location, drops off supplies.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.840
Was that the one that had a cargo net?

34:39.840 --> 34:40.840
Yes it did.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.440
Because I took pictures and video of that coming in.

34:43.440 --> 34:53.360
So that helicopter is dropping that net and that's when you crest the hill, kind of at

34:53.360 --> 34:58.440
some point there, you crest the hill to go investigate the craft.

34:58.440 --> 35:03.400
You come back, that helicopter is now gone.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.360
What I'm assuming is they dropped the cargo off and then they may have landed and let

35:07.360 --> 35:08.360
people out.

35:08.360 --> 35:13.520
But by the time you came back, there was no helicopter that was there.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.720
That helicopter was gone but then there was obviously the supplies that they had dropped

35:17.720 --> 35:18.720
off.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.720
Off of the distance.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.440
So do you remember seeing what was happening with any of that?

35:22.440 --> 35:23.440
Like were there people?

35:23.440 --> 35:27.280
I remember seeing people over there and they could have been supplies but they were off

35:27.280 --> 35:28.840
at a good distance.

35:28.840 --> 35:34.200
And so where the gunnery sergeant was, was he near some supplies too?

35:34.200 --> 35:38.560
If I can recall, there could have been some boxes or something he was messing with that

35:38.560 --> 35:41.200
was there.

35:41.200 --> 35:45.960
There may have been boxes, I don't really recall.

35:45.960 --> 35:53.800
I mean, what he have even, is there a chance that he didn't even know you guys were there

35:53.800 --> 35:55.440
and he was kind of like.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.440
Could have been the case.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.800
Like where are you guys coming from?

35:58.800 --> 35:59.800
What's going on?

35:59.800 --> 36:00.800
It could have been the case.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.640
I mean, like I said, I really don't know.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.640
It's speculation.

36:05.640 --> 36:09.240
But I just remember seeing a gunnery sergeant there who was like, you guys looked fucked

36:09.240 --> 36:12.840
up and he was yelling at us for that reason.

36:12.840 --> 36:20.160
And so from that period of time to when you left the LZ, you were basically just doing

36:20.160 --> 36:21.160
what?

36:21.160 --> 36:23.880
Just hanging around, waiting for the helicopter to show up?

36:23.880 --> 36:27.720
And we were just kind of walking around by ourselves, of course, trying to make it look

36:27.720 --> 36:30.200
like we're secure in the area.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.200
Okay.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.400
So you kind of resumed that role of security?

36:33.400 --> 36:36.920
Even though through our heads, we're going like, what the fuck just happened guys?

36:36.920 --> 36:40.480
Were you guys discussing this amongst yourselves or was everybody pretty stone cold?

36:40.480 --> 36:42.640
We were stone cold.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.640
Nobody wanted to talk about this.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.520
Was there any point that you guys discussed it with each other?

36:45.520 --> 36:53.040
When we got in town to Subic Bay, the only question I had asked one of them was, are

36:53.080 --> 36:58.240
you going to say anything about this or tell your wife and he goes, absolutely not.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.440
And that's literally it.

36:59.440 --> 37:03.240
And have you encouraged these fellow Marines you were with to come forward and tell their

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
story to?

37:04.240 --> 37:05.240
No.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
Okay.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.840
They're not happy with me for obvious reasons.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.720
I don't blame them.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.800
This wasn't something that, you know, I try to get one of them to help me with this to

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
an extent.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.920
And his response, which everybody has seen publicly, was kind of the indicator that

37:19.920 --> 37:22.920
something did happen, that something was wrong.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.840
And that's for people who don't know the text that was featured in the Daily Mail article.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.360
That basically says, leave me out of this.

37:28.360 --> 37:33.000
That was when I had members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asking me to have some

37:33.000 --> 37:40.360
and to message one of them that I was still in contact with, seeing if he could tell anything

37:40.360 --> 37:43.320
anonymously to them, which they already know who he is.

37:43.320 --> 37:49.000
I've already provided everybody the names to these guys among the Pentagon Arrow.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
They all have that.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.720
Do you know if they've been contacted by Senate Intelligence Committee or any of these?

37:53.720 --> 37:58.960
Not that I'm aware, because I'm pretty sure I would have gotten probably yelled at or

37:58.960 --> 38:01.160
fuck you or something.

38:01.160 --> 38:06.880
So you guys get picked up by the CH-53 Superstarion, returned to the USS Denver.

38:06.880 --> 38:11.040
How long, what would you say the time elapsed was from the second you were in the Chow Hall

38:11.040 --> 38:13.520
approached by the major to returning to the ship?

38:13.520 --> 38:16.440
Well, we didn't get approached by the major when there was in the Chow Hall.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.160
It was other Marines, other people.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.080
I don't remember specifically how that happened.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.080
So who called the volunteers?

38:22.080 --> 38:23.320
She wasn't gathering everybody up.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.720
These were higher up.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.920
It could have been staff sergeants or sergeants or something.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.840
It says, hey, you guys want to come with this?

38:31.840 --> 38:36.840
So whoever was at that point, you're going to meet in the ward room at this time.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.680
And I don't remember the specifics of the time.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.160
I don't remember who told us.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.720
I mean, that's just so long ago.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.760
Yeah, but it's just helpful to kind of understand the context.

38:43.760 --> 38:48.200
It wasn't anybody in my typical chain of command, which was, you know, because obviously

38:48.200 --> 38:50.960
they were kind of more the, hey, you guys are needed for this.

38:50.960 --> 38:55.000
And these were just mission volunteers, not hand selected, like strong operatives or anything

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
like that?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.400
No, they just randomly put us in sticks.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.200
That's all I remember them kind of organizing.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.800
You're in this stick, you guys are in this stick.

39:02.800 --> 39:06.520
So it wasn't like it was something that was very well planned or based off your skill

39:06.520 --> 39:09.120
set or what chain of command or whatever this was.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.120
Yeah.

39:10.120 --> 39:16.480
So like, I think we can kind of go chronologically through like your experience in Indonesia.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.480
So like the first thing I'm wondering is like, what, what did the typical day look

39:19.480 --> 39:21.320
like for you on the Denver?

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
On the ship?

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
Yeah.

39:23.320 --> 39:27.240
Like when you were, when you were like en route to Indonesia, like I know you were assigned

39:27.240 --> 39:32.000
to the officer's chow, like what would kind of a typical day look like for you just like

39:32.000 --> 39:33.480
on the ship?

39:33.480 --> 39:38.400
So typically, if I can recall this accurately, I mean, because every day blends together in

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
this.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.400
Yeah.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.400
Plus it was like 15 years ago at this point.

39:42.400 --> 39:46.400
So I mean, you typically go to have Reveley, everybody would get up, but obviously we'd

39:46.400 --> 39:50.800
get up early because we were either helping with breakfast and having to serve up that

39:50.800 --> 39:55.480
and at least, you know, which there's, it's not like we were just serving food because

39:55.480 --> 39:56.480
we didn't do that.

39:56.480 --> 40:01.960
We were just more, I think, trying to set stuff up, try to clean stuffs, you know.

40:01.960 --> 40:07.480
So the cooks actually took actual good care of their job because they're working for the

40:07.480 --> 40:09.280
officers, which is great.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.560
So they want to take pride in what they do.

40:11.560 --> 40:15.280
We got to eat really good because of it compared to what the other guys got to eat.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.360
So that was always good.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.360
So breakfast...

40:18.360 --> 40:22.920
It's kind of like a full-time job, like that assignment was, was kind of like, you would

40:22.920 --> 40:27.360
report for doing officer's chow and it was like an eight-hour shift type of thing?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
Yeah.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.360
Or was it okay?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.800
Sometimes they'd cut you like with a break so you could either go, which I went to the

40:31.800 --> 40:37.480
gym on ship or I went back and then slept for a bit or whatever it is.

40:37.480 --> 40:42.120
So there's always things that you can do because when they task you to work on to that, that's

40:42.120 --> 40:44.400
where you're spending your time.

40:44.400 --> 40:50.320
So how does it work with, you know, especially for me because like I don't have any, you

40:50.320 --> 40:56.240
know, military experience, you know, you have like a chain of command that you're a part

40:56.240 --> 40:58.660
of, you know, as a Marine.

40:58.660 --> 41:03.440
But I know there's, you know, when you're on the ship, you've described kind of like,

41:03.440 --> 41:05.160
it's like a separate chain of command or like...

41:05.160 --> 41:06.160
Correct.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.880
Because what, who you're reporting to are like the Marines that are in charge of that

41:08.880 --> 41:12.720
part of the Marines that are on the ship with logistics.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.840
All they basically did was say, hey, your number's been picked, you're going to go over

41:15.840 --> 41:17.600
here while you're on ship, which is great.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.600
Yeah.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.960
Because like I said, we got to have fun doing it.

41:19.960 --> 41:24.800
We got to eat better than everybody else, you know, so it was something that I enjoyed

41:24.800 --> 41:28.720
doing because I got to eat tuna all the time, I got peanut butter, I got all the good stuff.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
We got T-bone steaks.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.760
Everybody else got the little tiny cuts and we got full T-bones.

41:32.760 --> 41:33.760
Yeah.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.600
So you would work in child with people that weren't necessarily in your immediate team

41:37.600 --> 41:41.040
or platoon, just random people on the ship whose numbers were called for same duty.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.040
Correct.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.480
I mean, it wasn't really a number basis.

41:43.480 --> 41:49.920
They just selected whoever, whatever amount they needed, they've all been told us to,

41:49.920 --> 41:52.080
you know, this is what you're going to do.

41:52.080 --> 41:57.160
And typically during that, I do remember deploying, at least being forward-deployed

41:57.160 --> 42:03.040
to Japan a couple weeks to, I think, a month before the whole main element did because

42:03.040 --> 42:08.040
they got us ready and we went on ship before everybody else did too, because we're obviously

42:08.040 --> 42:09.200
working this detail.

42:09.200 --> 42:14.040
So they have to kind of read you up on things, show you how to do things, and then when the

42:14.040 --> 42:20.520
whole thing kicks off, get on ship and everybody's just, you know, so for weeks we were on ship

42:20.520 --> 42:23.200
with nobody else in our boarding, which was cool too.

42:23.200 --> 42:28.120
So they were trying to figure out where Marines were being assigned to, if that makes sense.

42:28.120 --> 42:33.320
Now, so when you got, you know, you spoke about getting briefed in the ward room, that

42:33.320 --> 42:34.880
was where you were assigned.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.440
So how did that exactly go down?

42:37.440 --> 42:42.440
Like were you like in the middle of, you know, working in the kitchen and then you just heard

42:42.440 --> 42:46.240
someone call out like, you know, hey, we need some volunteers, was it?

42:46.240 --> 42:47.240
I think it was that.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.560
I don't remember that part specifically.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.840
I just remember the key things.

42:51.840 --> 42:57.440
I remember who briefed us, which was a female major, and then they were putting up pictures

42:57.440 --> 43:00.400
of Obama when he was a kid, saying there was family members were there.

43:00.400 --> 43:04.520
So the things that really stuck out of place, I kind of, what I remember mostly.

43:04.520 --> 43:07.840
Now did you, you had actually brought this up earlier.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.000
Had you ever seen that woman before?

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
No.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.280
Like was she dressed in navy, do you soft blue?

43:13.280 --> 43:16.520
She was in, she was in our Mar-Pat Woodlands.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.520
Okay.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.520
So USMC.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.520
Okay.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.400
So were there other people who were kind of brought to volunteer with you?

43:22.400 --> 43:26.720
Were they in the mess hall with you when the major comes in and is requesting volunteers?

43:26.720 --> 43:30.680
Yes, some of them, not all of them, but some of them.

43:30.680 --> 43:34.200
And so at this time, like your immediate squad, team leader, the other people you're with,

43:34.200 --> 43:36.680
they're doing other duties on the ship.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.680
They're doing whatever the unit's doing, typically.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.840
So that's how that works.

43:41.840 --> 43:44.000
Now we weren't in a combat situation.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.800
So that's why that it was a little bit different because it's more relaxed.

43:48.920 --> 43:52.320
Now if this was something that was combat oriented, then they really wouldn't pull us

43:52.320 --> 43:56.240
off to do anything like this because we'd be training and doing whatever we had to do

43:56.240 --> 43:57.240
with our unit.

43:57.240 --> 43:58.240
Right.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.800
Because I know there's a lot of questions about like team leaders and so forth.

44:00.800 --> 44:05.000
So when you're on an active mission with a team leader, you'd be with them like glue,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.520
but on ships, you're assigned to your actual duties and so forth.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.520
Correct.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.880
And it also kind of depends on what details you're doing, obviously.

44:11.880 --> 44:14.040
So I mean, it's not like that for everybody.

44:14.040 --> 44:18.280
There's people, yeah, you have an acting team leader who's just a guy who fills that billet.

44:18.280 --> 44:22.120
He could be somebody else that's not, in our instance, was not in our platoon or squad

44:22.120 --> 44:23.120
or anything like that.

44:23.120 --> 44:29.560
So what kind of typical check-in would you have to do with any superior while on the

44:29.560 --> 44:30.560
ship?

44:30.560 --> 44:34.800
So when we would report to that, they'd obviously kind of take roll call, make sure everybody

44:34.800 --> 44:37.120
was there and then that's pretty much it.

44:37.120 --> 44:41.240
It wasn't, I mean, because really it's not like rocket science, for example.

44:41.240 --> 44:46.160
So you know, but it was, you also reported to Navy personnel too because they're the

44:46.160 --> 44:48.080
ones that you're typically helping and assisting.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.080
They're part of the ship.

44:49.080 --> 44:50.080
Correct.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.840
So they have more kind of what you would call a higher billet at that point because it's

44:52.840 --> 44:53.840
their ship.

44:53.840 --> 44:54.840
Yeah.

44:54.840 --> 45:00.200
That makes a lot of sense because that's really helpful just from someone who's not military

45:00.200 --> 45:02.840
that provides a lot of context.

45:02.840 --> 45:08.120
Now so during the actual briefing that you were given about the mission that you were

45:08.120 --> 45:15.080
about to partake on, were there other people in the ward room during that briefing or was

45:15.680 --> 45:22.680
it, so like there could potentially be bystanders that kind of overheard the mission briefing

45:22.680 --> 45:23.680
essentially.

45:23.680 --> 45:28.960
So anybody who was in there were some key leaders, but there was also some other NCOs.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.880
There were a lot of people I didn't know.

45:30.880 --> 45:37.360
So I'm just thinking there could potentially be witnesses that would have seen you, seen

45:37.360 --> 45:38.360
the briefing.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.360
If they remember.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.360
Yeah.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.360
I mean, right.

45:41.360 --> 45:46.160
You know, I mean, like I said, I don't remember anybody else besides some of the guys, but

45:46.160 --> 45:49.920
I just remember the thing that stuck out was a female major because she was beautiful.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
Yeah.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.480
Somebody that's, you know, of course you're on ship.

45:52.480 --> 45:55.000
You're like, man, I see a lot of women around.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.360
So there was that.

45:56.360 --> 46:00.440
And then obviously the whole thing with Obama, you really don't see anything like that.

46:00.440 --> 46:03.080
It's not something you're really briefed on most of the time.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.480
So I wanted to show this to you.

46:04.480 --> 46:08.400
Does this look like what that word would look like?

46:08.400 --> 46:12.920
I was trying to find a picture of like the actual Denver.

46:12.920 --> 46:13.920
Yeah.

46:13.920 --> 46:14.920
That would.

46:14.920 --> 46:18.880
That is a different ship, but it's the same, you know, the same class.

46:18.880 --> 46:19.880
Yeah.

46:19.880 --> 46:25.680
And from what I can recall, because they had a wall where the projector was hitting and

46:25.680 --> 46:26.680
that's where they were given.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.360
But that's kind of similar, at least from this view.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.360
Yeah.

46:29.360 --> 46:32.520
I mean, but then again, it looks a lot like other ward rooms that were on other ships

46:32.520 --> 46:33.520
that I've been on.

46:33.520 --> 46:37.280
Well, just to get a general idea of the size, like for me thinking like half a tier, because

46:37.280 --> 46:39.000
a ward room is essentially a cafeteria.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
It's just like a fancy.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Smaller because obviously, yeah, correct.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.480
So it's kind of a more small, intimate kind of setting.

46:47.480 --> 46:48.480
Correct.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.880
What else can you remember from this briefing?

46:49.880 --> 46:52.400
What was the mission operation directive?

46:52.400 --> 46:54.120
What was the mission time?

46:54.120 --> 46:58.480
I don't remember any of those fine details.

46:58.480 --> 47:02.120
Just because one, it's been a long time.

47:02.120 --> 47:09.480
But two, the only things I can recall is literally the female major briefing us and then pictures

47:09.480 --> 47:13.600
of Obama when he was a kid, his parents, just stuff that really stuck out.

47:13.600 --> 47:14.600
Yeah.

47:14.600 --> 47:18.160
And I actually found evidence of Obama.

47:18.160 --> 47:23.720
He spent a lot of time in Indonesia when he was a child and that's all public knowledge.

47:23.720 --> 47:27.160
So it's interesting that they had included that.

47:27.160 --> 47:31.840
But I mean, just overall, like in general, what was your understanding of like what you

47:31.880 --> 47:34.920
guys were about to go security security security.

47:34.920 --> 47:35.920
Yeah.

47:35.920 --> 47:40.440
But I think it was there was there was a delivery of supplies, you can go to it to a remote

47:40.440 --> 47:41.440
village.

47:41.440 --> 47:45.240
You know, there's plenty of evidence that that says that the right helicopter, the heavy

47:45.240 --> 47:49.800
lift helicopters, the super stallions on the Denver were specifically going to be tasked

47:49.800 --> 47:56.040
to go to remote villages because roads were being blocked off by by landslides and stuff.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.200
And so you're saying security for the elderly.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.200
Yeah.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.200
Yeah.

48:01.280 --> 48:07.320
The whole point in this isn't something that just even what that female major was saying,

48:07.320 --> 48:10.800
but it's just even the fact that everybody knows that this is the second largest terrorist

48:10.800 --> 48:11.800
capital in the world.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.880
And very, it's a very Muslim dominant area.

48:15.880 --> 48:16.880
You know what I mean?

48:16.880 --> 48:19.400
So there's people that typically aren't going to be very friendly of us.

48:19.400 --> 48:22.120
And that's kind of the first concerns they were having.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.560
Why they did things the way they did.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.560
I don't know.

48:24.560 --> 48:25.560
I didn't plan it.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.960
I wasn't in charge with that.

48:26.960 --> 48:31.520
So there's things that even I have questions or it's like, why would you do that?

48:31.520 --> 48:32.520
Yeah.

48:32.520 --> 48:36.480
And what was the protocol after the briefing where you immediately ordered to go to a armory

48:36.480 --> 48:41.040
locker, check out weapons and ammunition and report to the super stallions?

48:41.040 --> 48:44.320
So all they told us to do was basically get.

48:44.320 --> 48:50.800
So they got all her stuff and we went to the armory to draw what and they already had weapons

48:50.800 --> 48:53.320
picked for us because that was a sawgunner.

48:53.320 --> 48:57.720
So we don't, they didn't, we're not using a saw for this type of ordeal, you know, because

48:57.720 --> 48:59.920
it's not, you're not going into combat.

48:59.920 --> 49:02.520
So that's how I remember because I was a sawgunner.

49:02.520 --> 49:05.880
I never really was issued an M16.

49:05.880 --> 49:10.840
First time I, when I got there, I was actually issued a 203 with an M16A4 and that was with

49:10.840 --> 49:12.480
Gulf company.

49:12.480 --> 49:18.080
And they said that the reason why they wanted me to do that was because I was the boot and

49:18.080 --> 49:22.480
they're looking for the people with the grenade launcher because they know it's a team leader.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.520
So meaning that the enemy's going to target you.

49:24.520 --> 49:28.600
So which, I mean, it was, it was cool because I'm like, I get to carry a grenade launcher,

49:28.600 --> 49:33.480
but then I liked the saw because it's a belt-fed automatic weapon and I like that better.

49:33.480 --> 49:39.480
And so naturally being used to them 16, it's stuck because I like having a machine gun.

49:39.480 --> 49:40.480
Yeah.

49:40.480 --> 49:41.480
Full auto.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.480
Yeah.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
And I eat.

49:43.480 --> 49:47.960
So, you know, the whole idea of you providing security, you know, and initially a lot of

49:47.960 --> 49:53.360
people would say like, oh, that's baloney, like no one would have weapons on a humanitarian

49:53.360 --> 49:54.360
mission.

49:54.360 --> 49:59.800
Because really the overall operation was humanitarian relief, deliverance, supplies, and people

49:59.800 --> 50:01.720
like, oh, you would never have weapons.

50:01.720 --> 50:07.960
But I found Rear Admiral Richard Landolt, who's the Rear Admiral who debriefed you after

50:07.960 --> 50:10.320
your mission on the ship.

50:10.320 --> 50:15.960
He actually did a sort of like a press conference briefing and I'll just read a part of the

50:15.960 --> 50:18.240
quote here.

50:18.240 --> 50:24.760
So once the 53s came aboard on the morning of the 9th of October, we put them to work

50:24.760 --> 50:29.520
first getting survey teams out to the countryside to see where it would be the best locations

50:29.520 --> 50:34.600
to drop the cargo that we want to get there and also to get people in place because when

50:34.600 --> 50:39.440
these helicopters start showing up with cargo, the first concern is crowd control, you know,

50:39.440 --> 50:44.880
so you don't want people, you know, rushing the helicopters and another little interesting

50:44.880 --> 50:51.280
thing that kind of supports this that I found was photographs from the 9th and the 10th

50:51.280 --> 50:59.680
of the Indonesian military because there was also Indonesian military doing relief as well.

50:59.680 --> 51:04.000
And there's a picture of the helicopter in a whole bunch of locals just like all over

51:04.000 --> 51:06.960
the helicopter, just like mobbing it.

51:06.960 --> 51:13.160
Totally makes sense that there would be a mission like that to provide security and

51:13.160 --> 51:18.880
not to mention we've, you know, at this point, have found numerous photographs of people,

51:18.880 --> 51:21.400
of Marines doing exactly that.

51:21.400 --> 51:26.480
They had rifles and were, you know, providing security around the helicopters.

51:26.480 --> 51:27.480
Right.

51:27.480 --> 51:28.480
Well, I mean, security is needed.

51:28.480 --> 51:32.520
It's just common sense at that point, you know, as much as people would say in the military

51:32.520 --> 51:35.840
or at least in the Marine Corps, common sense is not common virtue, but you still got to

51:35.840 --> 51:39.960
protect and have a barrier between everybody else because second largest terrorist capital

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
in the world.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.440
There's also desperate people who are desperate to do anything for help.

51:44.440 --> 51:48.240
And you have that combination of things that can get pretty tricky.

51:48.240 --> 51:54.160
Thankfully, we didn't have that, but thankfully, I would have rather have experienced that

51:54.160 --> 51:56.080
compared to what we did experience.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.080
Right.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.080
Yeah, so.

51:58.080 --> 52:03.520
Now, do you remember, do you remember which day you did your mission?

52:03.520 --> 52:05.640
I don't recall specifically the day.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.960
That's kind of what I'm having trouble with.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.080
I don't know if it was the ninth or the 10th.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.640
So the ship arrived.

52:11.640 --> 52:15.840
So there's a little bit of discrepancy on the exact date and I think it comes down to

52:15.840 --> 52:20.400
the time zone of like whatever press organization reported it.

52:20.400 --> 52:25.520
But like, for instance, right in this testimony from, from the rear admiral, you know, he

52:25.520 --> 52:27.600
says the ninth.

52:27.600 --> 52:32.400
So it seems like it was like early morning on the ninth or like late at night on the

52:32.400 --> 52:34.400
eighth.

52:34.400 --> 52:38.080
So was it like, do you remember it being the very first day that the ship arrived?

52:38.080 --> 52:41.320
Oh, so, I mean, we never really went topside.

52:41.320 --> 52:46.560
So I don't, you know, we're in the kitchen or in the wardrobe or anything like that working.

52:46.560 --> 52:52.840
So I don't remember specifically where the only thing I remember is them turning the

52:52.840 --> 52:56.400
phones off because they had these phone banks that you have on ship and they turn it off

52:56.400 --> 52:58.520
for about a couple of weeks.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.480
And because I was going to call my dad and be like, Hey, we're here, you know, but they

53:01.480 --> 53:03.000
didn't want that.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.560
So I don't remember specifically the day.

53:06.560 --> 53:12.800
I do remember that when we were on foot that it was had to have been somewhere in the early

53:12.800 --> 53:17.920
afternoon or probably late morning, that timeframe, I'm not entirely sure.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.120
I can't recall that.

53:19.120 --> 53:25.240
I wish I could because then I can kind of pinpoint where things may have, we can coordinate

53:25.240 --> 53:26.240
it somehow.

53:26.240 --> 53:31.400
What, at what point did you realize that you weren't going to have radios?

53:31.400 --> 53:32.480
I wasn't a radio guy.

53:32.480 --> 53:33.920
So that wasn't, that wasn't my thing.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.920
So like wasn't even on your radar to like think, Oh, Oh, do we have radios?

53:37.920 --> 53:38.920
Yeah.

53:38.920 --> 53:39.920
Cause I'm not used to that.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.720
I mean, they trained us on the radios, but it wasn't something that we ever really had.

53:42.720 --> 53:46.880
I mean, I wasn't a team leader, a squad leader at that point, you know, so I didn't have

53:46.880 --> 53:47.880
access to that.

53:47.880 --> 53:48.880
And that wasn't a concern.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.480
My concern was just what I was dealing with.

53:51.480 --> 53:56.600
So I don't remember radios, you know, and the fact is, is I don't remember seeing anybody

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
have radios.

53:57.600 --> 54:00.520
And the thing is, is it's a humanitarian mission.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.080
It's not a combat operation.

54:02.080 --> 54:05.880
You know, so it's not like you're stepping out, expecting you get into firefights and

54:05.880 --> 54:06.880
things like that.

54:06.880 --> 54:07.880
Yeah.

54:07.880 --> 54:08.880
Just humanitarian.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.480
So when you guys were gearing up for the mission, you just thought whoever they designated

54:11.480 --> 54:16.200
kind of squad or team leader for this operation, they would have something like that, correct.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.160
And I think there's been a lot of confusion about these points.

54:18.160 --> 54:23.560
So this mission happened during one of your designated shifts in the chow hall with a

54:23.560 --> 54:26.000
team that was not your designated team leader.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Okay.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Correct.

54:28.000 --> 54:33.400
You know, the acting as a team leader, you know, so which happens, you know, in situations

54:33.400 --> 54:35.360
like this, at least this is my experience.

54:35.360 --> 54:39.320
I can't speak for everybody else, but just with what I personally dealt with, this is

54:39.320 --> 54:40.560
how it went for us.

54:40.560 --> 54:46.840
Now going back to the rifles, you know, like I said, at this point, I found so much evidence

54:46.840 --> 54:49.720
that there were definitely Marines there with rifles.

54:49.720 --> 54:55.160
However, there were a lot of photographs of guys basically just providing labor, you know,

54:55.160 --> 54:58.080
moving boxes, loading helicopters, things like that.

54:58.080 --> 55:04.160
And one thing that was interesting that I learned from multiple platoon members that

55:04.160 --> 55:11.800
I had reached out to and spoke to, they told me that there was like this rumor that some

55:11.800 --> 55:17.640
of the first Marines that flew in had rifles and they got like chewed out by like an Air

55:17.640 --> 55:23.440
Force Colonel and were told to like go back to the ship because it was like bad optics.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.920
I'm curious, did you ever hear that rumor?

55:26.920 --> 55:30.160
I don't remember ever seeing an Air Force Colonel.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.160
Yeah.

55:31.160 --> 55:34.080
I remember seeing Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, which everybody knows about that.

55:34.080 --> 55:37.460
So but as far as an Air Force Colonel, I don't, I don't understand how an Air Force

55:37.460 --> 55:40.760
Colonel would have jurisdiction over that kind of operation anyway.

55:40.760 --> 55:41.760
Yeah.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.480
He wouldn't be in a role to tell Marines that they have to go back to a ship.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.480
That's somebody else.

55:45.480 --> 55:46.480
Yeah.

55:46.480 --> 55:51.120
I found that, I found that odd as well, but I, you know, I didn't know, you know, not,

55:51.120 --> 55:52.120
not knowing anything about it.

55:52.120 --> 55:57.520
I didn't understand a Navy Fullbird Captain or a Marine Colonel for that matter.

55:57.520 --> 56:01.440
He would have the authority to say something like that because what you're talking about

56:01.440 --> 56:05.920
is the money and the resources to get X amount of people from ship to shore.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.800
So it's going to just, it's going to cost money.

56:07.800 --> 56:09.520
It's just going to not make sense at that point.

56:09.520 --> 56:15.320
So you got on the helicopter and you flew to Tobbing Airport, which it's not named

56:15.320 --> 56:19.320
that anymore, but you said that you never got off the helicopter at the airport.

56:19.320 --> 56:21.160
It was basically just, you know,

56:21.200 --> 56:23.320
we landed and that's what I remember too.

56:23.320 --> 56:27.640
And this is kind of what I was able to provide people because we'd never gone off.

56:27.640 --> 56:28.640
Right.

56:28.640 --> 56:31.400
And I can know that basically the direction of when we were flying off the ship that

56:31.400 --> 56:34.040
they could see the ocean and they can start to see the land.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.920
So it kind of tells you somewhat the direction of where you're heading.

56:36.920 --> 56:41.080
All I remember from the airport that we landed on was that there was blue roofs.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.080
Yeah.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.800
That's the only thing I can indicate out of that.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.960
What I'm getting at is it's, it's perfectly plausible.

56:45.960 --> 56:50.800
If you guys, you know, didn't get off the helicopters, it's perfectly plausible.

56:50.800 --> 56:55.960
You could have landed there and not caused any sort of stir by walking around with rifles

56:55.960 --> 56:57.880
because you didn't get out, get off the helicopter.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.280
Yeah, we weren't, we didn't.

56:59.280 --> 57:03.800
So because I remember that too, because we were sleeping on a helicopter because that's

57:03.800 --> 57:04.800
what you do.

57:04.800 --> 57:07.280
You know, you get used to in transport everywhere.

57:07.280 --> 57:11.240
We did in seven tons of AVs, helicopters, all that fun stuff.

57:11.240 --> 57:15.160
So you're just like, I'm just getting a ride and you can fall asleep anywhere at this point.

57:15.160 --> 57:19.240
So and it's boring, you know, it's not like it's anything.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.240
So it's just humanitarian.

57:20.240 --> 57:23.960
You know, we're hoping at that point that there would have been something, but not in

57:23.960 --> 57:29.280
the indication of what we experienced, but you know, something outside of that.

57:29.280 --> 57:35.120
So when we, because what I do remember vaguely is when we landed on the airstrip and I remember

57:35.120 --> 57:39.360
seeing other helicopters basically trailing behind us and land.

57:39.360 --> 57:41.880
And then we were sitting there.

57:41.880 --> 57:47.200
I don't remember the time or how long we were sitting there, but I remember then us taking

57:47.200 --> 57:48.200
off.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.160
It's 53.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.160
Okay.

57:51.160 --> 57:53.600
There may have been some 46 is two.

57:53.600 --> 57:58.880
I'm not entirely sure, but I only remember the Denver and I only remember being on a

57:58.880 --> 57:59.880
CH 53.

57:59.880 --> 58:02.760
I don't remember any kind of other helicopters that were on that deck.

58:02.760 --> 58:03.760
Yeah.

58:03.760 --> 58:07.000
I never really spent much time topside.

58:07.000 --> 58:12.080
The only reason I bring that up is it's, I'm wondering if those were the same helicopters

58:12.080 --> 58:15.840
that ended up following you guys to the LZ, you know, because I know you had said that

58:15.840 --> 58:22.440
there were other helicopters because they're, that could be plausible as far as I know.

58:22.440 --> 58:26.400
The Super Stallions were only the ones that came on the Denver.

58:26.400 --> 58:28.040
Like there weren't any additional Super.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.040
Yeah.

58:29.040 --> 58:31.480
I don't, I don't remember, you know, I don't remember any of that.

58:31.480 --> 58:32.480
Right.

58:32.480 --> 58:36.840
I mean, there's been plenty of ships that have been on where I remember seeing 46s, which

58:36.840 --> 58:39.840
are the dual, the egg beaters, if you will.

58:39.840 --> 58:43.960
I remember seeing plenty of those, you know, but as far as the Denver, I don't really recall

58:43.960 --> 58:44.960
that.

58:45.080 --> 58:46.080
And I could have not been.

58:46.080 --> 58:47.080
Yeah.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
I just don't know.

58:48.080 --> 58:54.680
Even if your mission happened after the point where those guys supposedly got yelled at

58:54.680 --> 58:58.800
for bringing rifles, like it's plausible that you could have had your mission even after

58:58.800 --> 59:04.160
that point and just slip by on notice because you didn't get off the helicopter, you know.

59:04.160 --> 59:12.680
So the flight to the LZ described the view that you have outside the back of the helicopter.

59:12.680 --> 59:18.600
So coming from the airport, I can remember just looking at the ocean and then we were

59:18.600 --> 59:25.800
getting, I remember seeing some very heavy vegetation and kind of like hills, wasn't

59:25.800 --> 59:28.320
like flat with trees or bushes or anything.

59:28.320 --> 59:33.680
It was like getting thicker and was, I remember seeing some hills, not from the helicopter,

59:33.680 --> 59:37.400
but because when you get off the bird, they have one area where you can't go because you

59:37.400 --> 59:41.280
have this big tail rotor and you don't want to run underneath the thing.

59:41.280 --> 59:44.960
So they always say either I think is go to the right or the left, I can't remember.

59:44.960 --> 59:49.880
But whatever the, whatever side that tail rotor is not on is where you're egressing

59:49.880 --> 59:50.880
the helicopter.

59:50.880 --> 59:56.600
And then basically you would form a 360 around the helicopter to provide that security and

59:56.600 --> 59:59.080
then it'd take off.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:03.760
And then you basically would get into formation and you'd patrol out from there.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:10.480
I don't really recall when I got off the helicopter what I really saw at that point.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.440
I do remember seeing some hills and remember seeing some big, thick vegetation.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.720
I don't remember if I saw any villagers or other personnel or people there.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:24.800
Backing up just a step, like when you guys were at the airport, were there any supplies

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.440
loaded on the helicopter?

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:31.080
So this was strictly a personnel transport and were there any other people on the helicopter

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.600
that were being taken to the LZ or was it just us?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
It was just us.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.400
And then you have the crew chief and you have some other crew support and then the pilots

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400
obviously.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.760
I don't really, I only recall one crew chief who's just basically walking up and down watching

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.920
everybody doing their job.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.400
I don't remember anybody else.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.040
I just remember just one guy and I don't remember seeing any kind of boxes or stuff

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040
that they would store in there.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.800
And obviously we didn't have anything on the bottom because how are you going to land at

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.600
the airport when you have something underneath?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.600
Yeah.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.680
Like a cargo hook type of thing, which some of the helicopters were transporting stuff

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680
that way.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.400
You landed at the LZ, you describe it as a hasty LZ.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400
Yeah.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:19.400
Now, I've come to learn that's like a technical term, that means something very specific.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.600
Are you using it in that way or what does that mean for someone who doesn't know?

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.720
Hasty is kind of like off the hip.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.520
It's not something very thought out.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.760
It's just like, okay, where can we, okay, right there looks good.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760
Right?

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.640
And that's maybe what they were thinking as far as the pilots are concerned.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.760
I don't know, but maybe they had it designated, but it just seemed to me because we were kind

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.360
of the first ones there that it'd be hasty in my opinion.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.720
But then when everything else is set up, some other Marines that probably come in were like,

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720
okay, this is secured.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720
It's something set up.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.200
It may not be a hasty LZ at that point.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.080
But when we approached it, I just remember not really seeing anybody there.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.320
So it's kind of like, okay, we'll.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.480
So there was no, so there weren't, there wasn't anyone at the LZ when you landed?

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480
Yeah.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.840
I don't recall that.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.640
There could have been some bystanders off to the, off in the distance that maybe saw

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.840
the attention or saw what was going on that decided to come up at a later point.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.720
But yeah, as far as arriving there, I don't remember seeing anybody.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.080
So you guys step off the CH-53, your primary objective is to provide security.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.640
What do you guys do right when you step off the helicopter?

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.040
Well, we saw this opportunity to take the slope because we have visual around everything.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.080
It allows us to basically act within that protocol, right?

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.880
As being in a tactical advantage of being in an elevated position is where you want

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880
to be.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.160
And that's what, you know, that wasn't the one that made the decision.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.360
The guy that was in charge of us was the one that made that decision.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.440
You know, it wasn't terribly too far in comparison, but at the same point, when you have visual

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:50.880
of that and you're also watching some other stuff happen, I remember really seeing one

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.080
helicopter that actually had the cargo net on the bottom that was flown in, dropped it

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.520
off and then it banked off to the right.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:04.640
What I'm curious is like, what was your initial impression when you got off the helicopter,

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:11.760
like in comparison to your briefing, like your expectations that were set by the briefing,

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.600
and then the reality of you getting off this helicopter and you're there, first of all,

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.320
you said the helicopter left, right?

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.600
Like it dropped you guys off, it's gone.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.720
You guys have no radio, there's really no one around.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.760
You guys are the only people there.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:35.760
So like, can you remember, like, was there an adjustment to your expectations of like

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.680
the reality of the situation versus what you were expecting?

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.200
Honestly, I thought it was more like, hey, we're not doing shit with this.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.200
Yeah.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.840
It's like it's just going to be boring to standing around looking at people like, you

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.520
know, and that's why I had a video camera when I was taking pictures and video because

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.200
I remember getting the one helicopter that dropped off something on video and I remember

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.320
getting it and needless to say, it wasn't at the point where we, you know, because we

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.040
were conditioned three with our weapons.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.320
It wasn't like it was chambered around or nothing.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.920
We just had a magazine inserted, safety was on, the bolt was all the way forward, weapon

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.560
was on safe and the ejection port cover was closed as it states in the condition rules,

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.640
right?

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.720
So I thought it was just, oh yeah, we're just going to be standing around.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.520
This is just going to be kind of boring, you know, even trying to help out with boxes or

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.280
something probably would have been more helpful in comparison here because you're actually

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
doing something.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
Yeah.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.280
Right.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280
So, you know.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280
That lines up perfect.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.560
Like every single person I've talked to who was on this operation, you know, doing different

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:39.960
missions on the operation described the same situation where they felt it was like boring.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.200
It was like an excuse to get off the ship.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.520
You know, obviously you're doing a good deed and you, and you know, it's, it's a good experience

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.320
from that perspective, but it's interesting to hear that because I think a lot of people

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.160
have this misconception that this was like, you know, because you had mentioned that,

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.400
oh, you know, you were notified there were terrorists in the, in the location that you

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.320
guys were like super on alert.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:06.920
Like this was like, you were ready to engage an enemy and, and you know, that sort of thing.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920
Nothing like that.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.320
Were you surprised when the helicopter took off?

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.320
Yeah.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.320
Okay.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.280
And did you have any sort of estimated timeframe when it was to return or the mission duration?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.000
I have no clue about that.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.080
You guys are, I suppose the squad leader decided that you guys should go up to the top of the

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080
hill, right?

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:30.080
And you know what, it makes sense because we were out in the open and you don't necessarily

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.600
want to be out in the open if you've got no support at that end.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.080
So where we were at was kind of hidden and you kind of get in the vegetation a little

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.080
bit more.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.440
So I can kind of understand why he would say, let's go ahead and push up this direction.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.800
Now you've mentioned a second helicopter flying in.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.480
You had your camera, you know, you, you took some pictures of that helicopter coming in.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:57.240
But did you, I almost remember you saying that it, it didn't fly to the same landing

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.760
point that your helicopter did.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.760
It landed somewhere.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.760
Off in the distance.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.760
Yeah.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.760
A little bit further away.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.760
So that makes me wonder kind of how big was the LZ essentially?

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.760
Like was it was kind of just like an open area?

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.880
Was it just like a, no, no, it was, it was pretty open.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.200
I remember it kind of being open, but that's where I remember the hills and stuff because

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.680
there was like an open area with thick, tall grass, right?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.840
And it was kind of, I would assume muddy because it's a tropical terrain, obviously.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.440
It wasn't like we were on a dirt road or something that was already, you know, cleared

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.120
out to be used as transportation.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.960
So I think it was just more in a sense that there's a clear area over here.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.240
And obviously there was, they probably, the second helicopter probably saw other people

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.760
that were probably close to that area and assumed that those are the people.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.080
For us, we were off in the distance.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.560
So whether or not he could see us at that point, I don't know.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.920
I assume he wouldn't be able to, but because where we were at, I mean, there's trees, you

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920
know.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.920
Yeah.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.120
So you didn't see any sort of like preparation to the LZ, like they didn't cut down trees

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.120
ahead of time.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.120
You didn't see any red tape.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:05.920
Cause I've seen some photographs of other LZs that showed like red tape kind of closing

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
off the area.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920
Yeah.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.680
I don't remember any red tape or seeing that kind of stuff.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680
So.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680
Right.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.000
So what the time elapsed was from the second you left the chow hall to returning to the

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Denver.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I had it been a couple hours.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Okay.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Had it been a couple hours.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
But not like a full day.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No, it was not a full day.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
It had to have been a couple hours.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
It was nothing.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.400
Something that could have taken place within the span of a chow hall shift.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.400
Like the time you'd spend working.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400
Probably more than that too.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400
Okay.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.120
You know, because it had to be a couple hours, man, you know, it wasn't, wasn't like an all

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120
day thing.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.120
Okay.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.120
Thankfully.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.400
You know what I forgot to ask is the, what was the weather like at the LZ?

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920
Sunny.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920
Yeah.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920
Yep.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920
Sunny.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920
I remember, I remember because it was hot.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920
I mean, it was hot.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:51.040
Regardless of, I guess, if there, even if there was cloud cover, it still would be hot because

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.400
it's tropical.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:59.840
I don't remember really, I don't remember actually looking up at the sky to see if there were

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.240
clouds or if it was sunny.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.320
I just remember it being hot, assuming it was sunny.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.400
And so when you get back to the Denver, how does it work?

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.840
Like, you know, you have your rifle, you have to like go back to the armory or something.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.560
We dropped everything off there, given the magazines.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.560
Wasn't my magazines.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560
It was somebody else's.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.560
What do you mean by that?

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.560
Well, there's the armor that gave us those magazines that were full.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.560
Because you were saw.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.920
So you had your own weapon assigned.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920
Yep.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.240
I had my own magazines, but actually remember if I actually had those on my vest too, or

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:38.480
if I were to left them locked up or in a typically had those in my assault pack, which I didn't

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:46.720
bring an assault pack with me, trying to think, remember, yeah, it was somebody else's magazines,

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720
for sure.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
So it wasn't mine.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.400
Because this was a loner M16, loner magazines from assigned to a different soldier.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:59.440
People compare you to like the like the Dodie and Benowitz story, and I'm like, that's completely

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:06.160
different because Benowitz didn't have this like a undeniable experience where he saw

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.160
an anti-radio.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.160
Correct.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.800
Yeah, radio communications and he speculated that it could be ET and Dodie just egged

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800
that on.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800
Correct.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.800
Yeah.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.800
This is totally different.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.800
And this is coming from Dodie himself.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.800
I asked him kind of what that whole thing was.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
Yeah.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.240
He said, yeah, well, somebody said they heard something, Paul, and this is what I was told

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.240
to do.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240
Right.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240
That's what he said.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.120
So I mean, like it makes, it just logically makes no sense.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.280
Like if you were making this up, if a disinfo agent were to come and like, be like, yeah,

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.160
I know about your operation that you stumbled upon.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.160
Yeah.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.400
It's like, if you made it up, you would know that he's lying.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400
Well, exactly.

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.080
Because how could he tell you that he knows about operations and stuff if it was made

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.080
up?

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.600
Like it just doesn't make any sense.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600
No.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.800
I mean, I wish it was made up because then I wouldn't have to have been going through

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:59.440
losing my fucking hair and having the, you know, sleepless nights and literally just,

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.280
I wouldn't be in the uncomfortable position I would be in.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280
Yeah.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.640
And it's not fun being in this position.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.640
It really isn't.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.240
I mean, that's why I tell people, especially, I'm not encouraging my guys to come forward

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.360
and let's say if this thing blows hope and then all of a sudden everything is able to

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.760
be proven true, and let's just say these insiders at some point ever do, or some information

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.240
comes out that's physical that literally no shit can prove everything, then maybe they

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.240
would.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240
I don't know.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240
Yeah.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240
But it put them in a different position.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.800
But right now, I mean, even for myself, they know that I'm uncomfortable and they kind

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.640
of like, well, it's your fucking fault.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640
I don't blame them.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.560
I mean, but if I didn't see what I saw and somebody else from a different perspective

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.560
was telling this story, I don't know how I would react to that.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.920
Probably, I probably wouldn't believe it.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.800
I'd probably be, but that's the only thing is before any of this happened, I was not

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.840
somebody who believed in this shit.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.440
I was somebody who was like, okay, well, this guy's out of his fucking mind or, you know,

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.080
well, you got, so you're, let me guess, you're in Mississippi and you're fishing and you

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.160
saw a fucking craft and you saw a fucking graze.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.400
Okay.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.920
What episode of X Files are you talking about?

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.400
That's how I would think of it.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.920
But then having my experience is just like, if I experienced this, okay, maybe there

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.560
might be some validity to what they're saying.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.560
I don't know.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.560
I wasn't there, but I know based off of being in my shoes, it's like, it's hard to say somebody

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.520
else is not true or to try to point out the flaws or anything like that.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.920
I know what it's like to be in somebody's shoes like that.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.440
Granted, I didn't see ETs.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.920
I saw operators and I saw it was clearly man-made.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.560
It was, didn't do shit on a normal helicopter or plane did.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560
I can tell you that.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560
Right.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.360
I mean, it's like an unmistakable experience like it's not like something you saw at a

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.360
distance.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360
I was like, oh, that looks weird.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360
Like this thing's right here.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360
Yep.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360
You see it.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360
It's huge.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360
We're close enough to hear it.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360
Yeah.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360
You know, right.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360
That's kind of the point.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360
And you saw it fly off.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360
Yep.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.360
I mean, it's like, didn't have a rotor.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360
It wasn't like a helicopter.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360
It wasn't a plane.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.360
Yeah.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.440
And no rotor wash on the vegetation.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440
Nothing.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.040
It was like it was isolated in itself.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.000
Like it didn't disturb any of the environment.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.080
It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.680
And I wanted to be a fighter pilot and I knew pretty much what kind of aircraft we had at

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.600
our disposal as a Marine Corps and especially the Air Force only has a certain amount of

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.560
planes they're using, helicopters, same thing.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.400
There's only so many.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.360
This obviously was an Indonesian military equipment.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.000
I don't remember anybody come and saying, hey, yeah, Indonesian military has something

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.280
that's sophisticated or Chinese or Japanese or for that matter.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280
Right.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280
You know.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280
Yeah.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.240
I find it interesting to, you know, you testified to Arrow and like I noticed in the historical

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:50.200
report, you know, they emphasize like belief and like, you know, basically trying to say,

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.520
you know, people might believe what they saw or anything, but we can't prove that they're

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.520
lying.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:02.320
And I'm like, what you're describing is an unmistakable testimony.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.120
There's no, it's not like you could say like, oh, well, maybe he believes that's what he

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.280
saw, but maybe it was something different.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.280
I know what I said.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.360
There's no way it was, you know, some normal thing.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.520
If anybody was to have seen this, they would remember this for the rest of their lives.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.200
It's so distinct because this never happens.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200
Right.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.200
It's stumbling.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.560
I mean, in some ways people think, oh, it's stumbling on the goal.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560
No, it's really not.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:31.520
But in some cases of saying that, yes, we have this technology because there's human involvement,

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520
obviously.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.720
It's not like there's an ETs and they're floating, flying in this damn thing.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.000
And there's just operators who just choose to be there.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.840
I mean, it's completely manmade.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.320
And with the human involvement just tells me, okay, well, manmade human involvement means

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.560
it's some group has it.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.820
Now I know who it is to an extent.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:56.600
And speaking of Aero, I really wanted to kind of fast forward to when you talked to him

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.320
in April of 2023.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.320
What was that like?

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.000
Well, like an interrogation to an extent.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.280
And so you spoke directly to Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, right?

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.120
He's the only one that I can confirm that yes, I talked to.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.240
I know the other gentleman, but what I signed stating that I was not allowed to divulge

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.920
where we met at or who was also there.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.120
But Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the interview.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.600
And I think he was in everybody's interview.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.320
I'll have to ask other whistleblowers.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.720
I personally know if he was sitting in there with them, but he was there.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.600
What was his demeanor like when you were speaking to him?

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.960
Not really interested.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.720
Everybody else was taking notes.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.240
He was more interested in the fact of, because he only asked three questions and the three

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.360
questions were all the same.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.160
It was who were these operators?

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.800
I already stated once, I don't know.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.040
I'm not going to know the second time.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.560
I'm not going to know the third time.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:55.520
I know a little bit now of what group they're a part of and what their backgrounds may be.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.880
But I don't know who they directly are.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.240
And if it was any of the people that I've been talking and working with, I would remember

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.240
who they are based off their faces.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.920
And none of them are those guys.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.400
When you testified to him, did Dr. Kirkpatrick say he'd follow up?

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.760
Did he say what was going to happen next?

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.760
Oh, yeah.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.760
We'll follow up on it.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.840
Because I had asked them if they could get the satellite imagery of that day and they

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.880
said they had access to that.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.680
It's been more than a year and they have yet to have anybody contact me from Arrow saying

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.200
that, yes, we have the imagery.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.520
Where can you point out?

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.520
Because compared to 14, 15 years ago, it's going to look different.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.800
Maybe they expanded the city.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.040
There's things that vegetation have grown.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.880
There's any numerous things that could have happened between at that point to now.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.360
And how did you feel when the historical report volume one came out that was a complete

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.480
misprint lie of your testimony stating you saw an extraterrestrial vehicle?

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480
Correct.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480
I didn't say extraterrestrial.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.680
And I didn't say there were US special forces.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.000
None of that came out of my mouth.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.520
And you got to think that that's a purposeful omission to say those things because that's

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.000
blatantly false.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Correct.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.640
I've stated in every single interview and even in the National Press Club and even with

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.480
some gentlemen that I've still in touch with who was in the skiff with me, he for one knows

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.120
I never said anything like that because he was sitting right here when I was talking

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.160
to Kirk Patrick among others.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.320
So I was pretty upset at the fact, but you can't really be upset because you already

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.920
kind of expected them to do something like this and that's just what they do.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:34.920
Was there, because I think some of the people who testified to Arrow, there was a written

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.880
memorandum for record of their testimony.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.880
Do you know if there was any written record of what you told them?

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.880
I don't remember that either.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.000
I remember them taking notes and handwriting everything trying to get the details.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.880
But I think it was something that the witness would sign.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.400
They would read over it like, okay, yeah, this is what my testimony, they would sign

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.840
it for record to be like, this is my testimony that I provided to Arrow.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.960
I signed several documents.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.960
That could have been one of them.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.040
I don't recall that.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:09.000
I remember saying a nondisclosure saying that I would not talk about who specifically

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.880
was there besides Dr. K already admitting that he was in our interviews.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.200
So that's easy.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.360
The other gentleman, I can't.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.600
And then the location, I can't talk about that.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.080
That's legal binding because it's not anything illegal.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.520
So I have to respect that.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.840
What other memorandums have you seen for the Arrow?

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:32.440
Because I've only seen Eric Tabers, who of course is a second hand kind of commenter.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:41.560
Well, I think there was something that was FOIA release from the Black Vault that I had

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:49.360
recognized was a direct, it was the same exact form that you had shown me.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
So I had recognized that.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.160
And that was provided for me to look over before making that trip.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.560
Prior to, yeah, it wasn't like the actual one you signed, but it was kind of a review.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.600
Yeah, because there were screenshots of this gentleman's cell phone that he sent me who's

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.600
involved with that.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.960
Did you watch his interviews with Steven Greenstreet?

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960
It'll just piss you off.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.640
I don't watch any of his shit, dude, because I just know it's all bullfucking lies.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.640
There was supposed to be a second piece that completely got moved.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.640
You know what would get people's views if they, hey, Sean, go ahead and come on to this

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.640
podcast.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.640
Here's the whistleblowers.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.560
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560
Haven't seen you in a while.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.720
Thanks for being a fucking dick.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720
He would never.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.720
He said he would.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.840
Guess what?

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.960
I can contradict the shit that he's talking about.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960
So can other people.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.120
He said he wouldn't do any more media appearances after getting caught at a 2018 skinlocker ranch

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.120
briefing.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.120
He's live.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.880
Well, Brandon actually had posted that.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.880
Because he did the same thing.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.280
I didn't talk to him about this.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.280
I wasn't at this meeting.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.320
And then Brandon just posted the picture on Twitter.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.320
I remember I hit Brandon up at that point.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320
Yeah.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:19:01.280
What I actually kind of find funny is, so Nathan came forward.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.840
Your team leader claims that you're making this all up.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:15.360
First of all, it's like, so he was unvetted with Patrick.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.520
It was framed as if he was in a position.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:26.080
There's no situation where Nathan would have seen the UFO because from your testimony,

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.560
he wasn't part of your squad that was there.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.680
So he wouldn't have seen the UFO, right?

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.680
Not at all.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.680
Yeah.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:39.240
So for him to be like, yeah, we were on this mission, but we didn't see the UFO doesn't

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.240
make sense.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.720
Because whatever mission he did, obviously he didn't see the UFO.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.840
No, and that wasn't on the same one with him.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.840
Exactly.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.520
Nor was this a secret night mission.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520
No, it was not.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.560
It was a secret, and it did not involve aliens.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.840
Not at all.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.680
I never spoke seeing ETs, guys.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.640
That's kind of why this is boring in comparison to other people's stuff.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.880
But no, it was not a night mission.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.960
That would have sucked if it had been our night.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.800
We didn't have night vision with us.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.040
My Kevlar, and I didn't even have a Rhino mount to mount anything because I always kept

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.240
that off because it just get in the way during the daytime.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:26.480
Quickly I had, on my Kevlar I usually had goggles that were clear lenses.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.040
Most of the time it was just easy to pop those off and put them on just because, you know,

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.760
I didn't like having darks because they just really fucked with my vision and just, I hated

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.760
it.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:40.040
And not only that, but these were ESS and they fogged up like you wouldn't believe.

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:43.360
At least clears are easier to deal with that as opposed to the dark lenses.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.520
But yeah, Nathan wasn't with me.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.440
Yeah, and I mean, so like one thing that I find kind of funny, like when you think about

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.800
it, you know, if, you know, he's saying you made this all up.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:59.760
And so if that's the case, it means not only did you decide to make up a story about UFOs,

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.840
but you decided the actual mission I went on with Nathan, I'm going to pretend that

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.600
didn't happen too, which makes no sense whatsoever.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:17.240
And I mean, really the only thing that makes Nathan's testimony have any weight whatsoever

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.920
is simply the fact that you're denying that you were ever on a mission with him because

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.880
you could have very easily have just said, yeah, I did two missions.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.480
I did one with him and I had this other one.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480
Yeah, I didn't do two missions.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:32.360
So it's like, it's just like anyone with half a brain would like know that, you know, if

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.560
you were making this all up, just say, yeah, I went on this real mission with Nathan.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.360
Well, yeah, it could easily have said something like that.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.800
If that was really the case, if I wanted to lie about you, but then obviously the insiders

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800
wouldn't exist.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.040
And you know, well, that's the biggest thing for me is like, why would this insider be

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.040
approaching?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040
And it's just not one guy.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
It's multiple.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040
You know what I mean?

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:58.480
So why would they spend any time to try to help me if I was lying to anybody?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.980
Why would they expose themselves and their parts of it in details that I personally know?

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.800
They wouldn't take that chance.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.400
They're already, their butts already puckered up just like mine compared because obviously

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:15.320
what they're having to deal with personally, they wouldn't subject themselves to going

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.680
to somebody who's lying.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.360
It doesn't make any sense.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:27.040
But so Nathan, the thing that's most compelling about Nathan is, you know, he is who he says

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.040
he is.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040
Correct.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.040
You know, he was your team leader.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040
At one point, yes.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.600
He was on that operation.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.600
He was on the ship.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.880
All of that stuff logically lines up.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.560
And he has this photograph of two people on a helicopter.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.440
He says one of them is you.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440
You've denied that.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.440
You said it's not you.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.440
Correct.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440
I know who it is.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440
I'm not going to say who it is, but I know who it is.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.440
Yeah.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:58.800
So the thing, the thing that's interesting though is someone found a match in the camouflage

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.840
between that photo and another photo of you.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.520
Is it the Daily Mail photo?

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
Yeah.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520
Yeah.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.800
Because there's only two photos that I know that have been released.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.200
One of them was when I sent to Josh Bosworth with Daily Mail because they're like, hey,

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.640
do you have any pictures you want to?

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.640
Yeah.

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.520
I believe it's you helmet on holding the saw.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
Correct.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520
So yes.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.720
And I mean, but here's the thing.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.160
It's a medium rag that I was wearing.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.480
A lot of them are the same patterns of that way.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.360
It's not like it's a fingerprint of one specific thing.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.080
I mean, it's odd that it's in the same location.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.080
Like I know like some of the patterns repeat and that you can find examples of this all

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.320
over of finding like the pattern, you know, on a leg here and then on a different uniform.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.640
Like it'll be on like the other leg or whatever.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.640
Right.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.200
And but it's like some of the patterns don't even look identical.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.200
Just a minor pain.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.200
Yeah.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.200
You know, that's just where we're at.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.560
So you don't think there's any possibility that like it was it was a picture of you on

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.560
a different day?

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.040
No, that was not me.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.120
It just simply facial structure doesn't look the same as mine.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120
Yeah.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.120
It's not even me.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.320
I mean, even everybody I've showed that knows me is like, that's not fucking you, dude.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.320
Yeah.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.440
People text me like this guy saying it's you.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440
That's not you.

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.440
Yeah.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.840
So I mean, if that's what he's got, that's what he's got.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840
That's not me.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.720
Right.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.920
But his intention with this is I don't know, but they're just, I mean, you guys have a

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:23.920
history.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.960
I mean, oh, he doesn't like me flat out and the feelings mutual.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:30.920
But the thing is I moved, I got with what I'm dealing with in my life and that's all

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.080
I'm focused on.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.960
I'm not making money off of this stuff.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.520
This doesn't get me anywhere financially.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.840
What it does provide is understanding and stuff that I wish I never learned, but the

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.680
truth had to be known and I'm thankful at least these insiders were able to show details

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:50.080
and share me details as well of what they were personally dealing with because these

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.360
guys are working in that organization.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360
Yeah.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:59.640
So let's let's fast forward to that kind of modern day after your whole experience.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.520
You don't talk about this for many years.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:09.600
What motivated you to come forward in because you signed an NDA that basically died in your

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.080
life and correct and all of all of us did sign that.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.680
So what motivated you to come forward?

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.800
What was your objective?

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.360
Well, I just think the truth should have been out.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.000
I don't think that this should be secret and I don't think people should be dying and

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.400
being threatened about ETs or craft or anything.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400
It just sounds ridiculous to me.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:38.920
So my motivation was, you know what, somebody else out there besides the guys I was with

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:46.680
and myself have had to have similar experiences and maybe maybe there's a chance in hell that

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:49.080
mine connects the dots for something.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.800
Maybe my story can help other people to an extent as crazy as it sounds and don't get

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800
me wrong.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.080
I agree that it's absolutely sounds fucking nuts, but they're not in my shoes and I wish

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.720
some people were because it'd be like, you guys would just shut up.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.720
You guys would stay quiet.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.760
You guys were like, yeah, that's not cool to talk about.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:12.120
I don't enjoy talking about it, but that was kind of my, my intention was maybe that this

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.560
could help paint a picture or contribute in some way, shape or form.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.560
Yeah.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.160
And I think, you know, there was, there were whistleblower protections that had recently

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:29.920
been been passed and I think I remember you talking about that kind of being part of your

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.920
motivation like that.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920
Yeah.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.880
Now that I have a safety net to an extent making the NDA illegal, you know, so obviously

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.160
I haven't had any ramifications of that because it's not like, I mean, I've had harassment,

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.960
but you know, and the harassment service is more of like, okay, well, obviously I'm pissing

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:51.440
the right people off, you know, so if I, again, I have documentation of all the harassment

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.560
that I've talked to with multiple people who know what's going on.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.000
If I was making any of this up, there wouldn't be this harassment, there wouldn't be these

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.520
insiders or wouldn't be this, I wouldn't have a leg to stand on with, with other facts.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.680
Now there are facts in my world that says somebody else observing outside of my circle,

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.240
they may say, okay, in their world it may not be facts, but for me in my world it is.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:19.040
When I first connected with you after my initial Reddit post kind of just researching the military

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.880
side of the operation and like realizing that, you know, everything you said to a letter

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:31.400
was accurate regarding the kind of surrounding circumstances and I was like, okay, well what's

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.640
next, you know, and so we, you know, I reached out, we connected.

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:43.120
If I'm honest, I actually grew more skeptical as we started talking because you all of a

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.680
sudden started talking about this insider and I'm like, this is weird, like what are

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:52.960
the chances that you would have this experience and now all of a sudden someone telling you

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.920
that they know what you saw and they want to meet with you.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.000
So you know, I didn't have anybody else that I was talking to with this, I don't, I don't

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.080
have a lot of friends, I don't care to have a lot of friends, I got a lot of acquaintances,

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.640
I got a lot of people who know who I am to an extent.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.200
My world is just business and that's what I, you know, I separate this from business

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.640
because business is what my livelihood and my employees are, that's what I care about

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.520
as well as the disclosure of wanting the truth to come out.

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.800
So it's not like I had anybody else to say, hey, and then when I saw what you were doing

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:28.480
and I saw the attention to detail and everything that you were piecing together, that kind

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.360
of put something in my mind to say, you know what, maybe this guy can help me out to an

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:37.880
extent, maybe there's things that he could probably pinpoint or, or connect the dots

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.160
on and just your attention to detail was just something that's like, you know what, this

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.720
guy's got to ship together.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.600
Maybe I'm able to provide information to you that, because you seem like you, you're well

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.040
versed in this, I'm not.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.200
I know what I experienced and there's other things I'm now learning, especially with your

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.640
guys' help, especially pointing out to me things that I can pass on to other people

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.920
and say, yeah, Rene, is this having any legitimacy to it?

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.200
So, yeah, I was surprised at the amount of trust that you kind of put into me, right?

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.400
Because like if you had, if you had like told stuff to the wrong person, you could have

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.960
been, but I had a good chance of reading you and kind of gauging you, which is why we had

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960
a phone call that we initially had.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:28.400
And the biggest, the, the most craziest, biggest moment for me was, you know, you were talking

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.520
about this insider who wanted to meet with you.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.840
I was so skeptical.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.320
It sounded so crazy, but like I had nothing to lose.

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.480
It wasn't like I was this podcaster who like had to report on the story.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.160
Like I could back away from the whole thing if I, if it fell apart and I felt sketchy

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160
about it.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.760
I was like, you know what, let's just see what happens.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.920
We had a phone call the day before I recorded that without your knowledge.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:56.240
Oh, I was freaked out because these guys could have done anything.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240
I was going to their backyard.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.640
I wanted to scream at you and like say, dude, don't go.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:05.720
I know, but I had to, I had to learn the truth and that's what they were offering.

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:06.720
They weren't offering money.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.200
They weren't offering anything like that.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.120
They were offering a chance to set me and set the record straight of what I witnessed.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:20.000
And I think after keeping this, you know, it's quiet for 14 plus years.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.360
I think I deserve the truth.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.120
I think everybody deserves the truth because for what's going on is absolute bullshit of

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:33.000
why it's secret and why these guys feel in the right mind that they want to kidnap people

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.400
or offer them a way out of their situation and use them as a biological equipment in

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.920
these programs is just, it doesn't sit well with me.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:49.440
I understand why, but I think if there was some kind of government intervention with

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.240
this that there may be good people that want to volunteer, maybe see what they can do and

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.960
if they can, that's their thing.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:59.760
And I understand that these guys are also doing the same thing, but I think they're

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.760
given false promises.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:05.040
I think they're being misled like they are because that's why they're partaking in this

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.040
and they don't understand the magnitude of what they're doing.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:12.120
And from my current knowledge, I know that a lot of them don't know what they're getting

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:16.640
involved with because they're heavily drugged and they can't recall what they're doing specifically

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.560
with what they're making contact with.

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.560
Yeah.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.560
I wanted to ask you about this.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:26.240
So it was during the NPC, you learned that these crates weren't trafficking drugs, but

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.600
people.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.880
So I did a two day event prior to that.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.520
It was June 10th, 11th and 12th.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.000
Was it the 12th that the NPC was on?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Yeah.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.120
And then a Daily Mail article came out the 10th or 11th and the NPC was out of the 12th.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:50.080
Because I had talked to Josh Boswell with Daily Mail prior to going to DC.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.460
And Greer was the one that set all that up.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:32:02.640
And my goal as much as I possibly can is having some transparency because I think that's important.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.500
And as uncomfortable it is for me to be public.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:12.220
I don't enjoy it, but if I'm able to provide in any kind of asset to disclosure in any

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.300
kind of way, I'm not here for money.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.300
Everybody knows that.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.740
I sleep good because I'm not for that cause.

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:22.140
I make my own money as you guys know, you guys have seen.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:27.500
So and it's even crazier that I got employees that don't know what I'm doing.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.780
And I don't talk about it freely.

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:31.300
There's some people who do and they're kind of curious.

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.380
Did they just like kind of find out on their own?

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.380
Yeah.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.340
Some people talk.

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:41.180
So I assume that some people don't know because nobody asks me.

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:45.100
Some people have seen what I did and they're texting me, man, that's, you know, they kind

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.580
of try to get in detail with it.

01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.700
I'm like, I can't tell you much, man.

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:56.100
You know this, you know, just jumping back to, I just wanted to emphasize that the biggest

01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:00.500
moment for me and you actually at this point, you're kind of like totally read into all

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.340
of the evidence that I have.

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:09.620
So like that meeting you had with the insider was the pivotal moment for me because that

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:15.460
conversation that you and I had prior to the day before that meeting gave me very specific

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:21.820
starting point to be able to track the helicopter.

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:29.580
I knew the location where you guys were meeting and it just, it set up a way for me to verify

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.580
a lot of things.

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580
Correct.

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.140
It was an important piece of evidence.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.460
And so that is what led me to...

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.260
To verify on your own accord.

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.580
To verify without you even knowing.

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:41.580
Correct.

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.580
Where you went.

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.180
I was really surprised when you told me after the fact.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:47.300
I was like, how the fuck did you find that?

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:51.780
And I was like, okay, now that it's obvious after that point.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:58.260
And I think it was a good slip up to an extent because it was able to at least pinpoint somebody

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.620
to be able to verify.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:07.380
Because with that helicopter flight, you were as well as I was able to provide other events

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.380
that were going on.

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:12.460
Yeah, that was the other thing because like prior to me revealing to you that I like

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:17.620
tracked it on radar, I was like, hey, do you remember what time you took off and you told

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:20.980
me and it was exactly what the radar said?

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.340
I was like, holy crap.

01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:30.180
And then, yeah, there were some kind of limited time kind of events that were happening on

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:36.420
the ground that could be visible from the air and you corroborated that.

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:45.700
I was able to cross check that with local news and like I've spoken to you about how

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:49.860
I authenticated the evidence and used...

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:53.780
And the only thing I could say without going into specifics is you know where I went.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.780
Yeah.

01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:58.020
That's all we're going to talk about at the moment.

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:02.460
And I know you know now because he's provided and I've okayed that because I think some

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.620
people should know.

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.660
I trust you guys.

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.500
You've been by my side for a year without finally meeting you today.

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.780
It's still crazy.

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:12.780
Yes.

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.620
But I can tell because I read people very well.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.740
That's where sales comes into.

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.100
I can kind of gauge.

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:23.380
And I know that you're for the truth and I know you are too.

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:24.380
And I am as well.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.020
We're all in the same shoes as far as wanting this to come forward and wanting this whole

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:31.740
thing to stop because our way of life can improve.

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:36.460
The Insider provided a lot of information for you to disseminate.

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.460
Yes.

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:46.660
And granted, it was tough for me because they were in attendance and it was a group of day,

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:47.660
not pronouns.

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.940
They were in the NPC 2023.

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:52.300
They were there but they were also there at the other events.

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:53.980
The one three days before.

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:55.660
It was two days.

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.860
So it was a 10th, 11th and 12th.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:02.340
So it was during, was that on a Monday, the NPC?

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.100
Let me look real quick.

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:07.020
So you were talking about just a couple of days before the NPC.

01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.380
That's when you first kind of met these insiders.

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:14.940
So I didn't meet them directly but I know that they were in attendance.

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:21.780
And when I had presented on that Saturday, I believe, is when it was.

01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:22.780
Saturday and Sunday.

01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:29.940
Yeah, I think it was the Saturday and Sunday because I got in Friday afternoon or morning

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.580
and then they went to the hotel.

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:35.700
I had dinner with Greer and everybody kind of met them.

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.940
Actually, it was a couple of drinks at the hotel.

01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:43.140
And then we got our rooms, got everything situated.

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:46.060
Going downstairs, I introduced my wife to everybody too that I've already been kind

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.940
of somewhat familiar with and talking to.

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:52.540
And it was my first time of meeting some people like Michael Stratton person, Dr. Greer

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.540
in person.

01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:56.980
Well, no, that'd be the second time because he was here in Boulder.

01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:01.140
That's when I first actually met him and I was in 2017.

01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:08.420
And I was, I just kind of felt that he was somebody at the time who was talking about

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:14.260
this and there were some things that he had hinted that were may have been maybe other

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:17.060
people of experience would have experienced that he was talking to.

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.940
So I wanted to tell him, Hey, this was my situation.

01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:24.660
You know, anybody else who went through this, maybe it's something I can convey and compare

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.660
notes to this person.

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:31.500
And of course, they don't, some of them are dead and some of them refuse to talk understandably.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.540
But yes, these insiders were there.

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:38.660
So when I had did that event and it may be on YouTube, I can't find it anywhere.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:42.860
It may be on YouTube or some, because I know it was recorded because Dr. Greer and myself

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.740
were kind of frustrated that their audio and video people were kind of slacking.

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:58.980
I had given my piece that day and I had expressed that what I hypothesized was drugs, right?

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:04.020
And that's when Dr. Greer pulled me aside and showed me his phone that had text message

01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:06.900
from this individual that had, he had this encrypted app.

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:13.860
It was not signal with some other high tech communication platform did not look like signal.

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:19.780
And I read the text message and what that text message said was, and my wife was actually

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:24.260
sitting on the couch in the, in the green room and I was close to her and Dr. Greer was standing

01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.660
to my right.

01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:32.860
And the text message said, I don't want to leave Michael hanging, but I know what Michael

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:40.340
saw and he went through this whole, he wrote a Bible essentially of what it was to an extent.

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:48.100
But he had talked, he wanted to now talk to Dr. Greer privately and discuss what it was.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:52.620
And so I, at that point, because I was, I was volunteered security for him, which is

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:56.380
what I'm doing with this too, but it's more of me to kind of see what the fuck else is

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:57.380
going on.

01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:59.100
That's just how I can get information.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:03.900
So you do, you perform, you help benefit somebody, but you also get to kind of learn more in

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:07.860
depth with what's kind of being going on and you get to be in the sensitive meetings and

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:13.540
stuff and kind of really see, so it's kind of my personal way to kind of disseminate

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:17.300
information and maybe be able to understand.

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:22.820
That's just my curiosity, but I met that gentleman, which of course he didn't know that I knew

01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:26.060
who he was to an extent because Greer said he was going to meet with him and maybe they

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:31.420
were going to put me in a green room and have a face-to-face conversation, which never happened.

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:35.580
And then I wake up to a text message that he sent me at two o'clock in the morning.

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:40.940
I don't remember what day, I still have it because I have it all saved, of course, just

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:41.940
in case.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.980
I have a paper trail just in case anything happens.

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:57.060
And he had said that a gentleman's name, to an extent, knows what I saw and would like

01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:02.900
to talk to me about it, and he is the knock, non-official covers what that stands for in

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:12.180
the CIA term, and he gave me his phone number, which is one of many, at least that number.

01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:18.940
So I was like, oh shit, okay, and it wasn't like I wasn't expecting it because I was like,

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:23.380
okay, this guy probably won't bother with me, he'll just tell Dr. Greer everything and

01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:29.460
then Dr. Greer will tell me what I dealt with and experienced, but that wasn't the case.

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:36.500
So I sat on it for probably about a day or two because I was like, okay, here's a point

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:40.860
and I'll return realistically, and then I was like, you know what, fuck it.

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:48.060
So you're referring to he wanted to meet with you, what was the message that you sat on?

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.900
So the message I sat on was Dr. Greer providing me his contact information.

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:54.340
So that's what I sat on.

01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:59.820
And so I was just thinking every scenario in my head, like oh fuck, what am I going

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:06.260
to, what is this doing, am I getting set up, was part of that too, I mean it's a percentage.

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:09.020
Because I'm nervous, you know, I've already kind of said my piece, I'm nervous now the

01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:15.900
whole world knows what I disclosed and it was very uncomfortable, I hate fucking being

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:20.940
public, but it's just, it's something that needs to be done.

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:27.380
And he had, I called him and he did not answer and he did not have a voicemail set, so then

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:31.820
I texted him and he responded immediately.

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:35.620
And I have it, I have the text messages and basically what he said, he was going to fly

01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:41.220
me out somewhere and he was going to be able to provide me documentation among other things

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:47.180
that will help me with this, but now that I came forward, these guys were working in

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:51.180
that organization that I witnessed doing this operation.

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:55.220
He had some insight to tell me and that's what we did, we met up and you had the phone

01:41:55.220 --> 01:42:02.620
call of that and you have some details about where I met this gentleman particularly and

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:05.620
where he flew me off to, to provide me more information.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:10.100
Now why do you feel like he wanted to meet you in person versus just talking on the phone

01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:12.220
or video call, that sort of thing?

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.420
Like what was that?

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:16.460
I think it was establishing trust.

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.220
It's easy to talk to people on the phone, getting face to face with people and having

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.620
them tell you things.

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:27.300
Now granted, when him and I met and we were sitting across from each other, and I've said

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.540
this in multiple interviews, but I had my phone off because he had had this one that

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:36.620
can detect any chips and I showed you the text message, or the message that he sent

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:41.780
me talking about why they did that and which they're all chipped.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.540
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:50.860
But I guess it was a chance to get the truth and I can tell when he was talking to me that

01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:55.700
he was very fidgety and very nervous because he doesn't know who I am and I don't know

01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.700
who he is.

01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:00.000
So him being nervous, but he looked through my background.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.520
He looked at every possible detail about me, so he knew everything.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.440
So I know that he knew that wasn't some asset planted in trying to fish people out, which

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:12.360
I know is a concern of theirs, which is why they're screening people heavily and do what

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.000
they do.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.800
So which I was just as nervous and that's when he, during that interview or meet up,

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:27.120
that meeting, that's when he provided me a sidearm as a way to establish trust.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.920
And I looked at the bullets and there were no struck primers, nothing like that, popped

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:37.840
it in, wrapped it, put it on a lap like this and nobody else was armed.

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.400
At that point, I kind of started getting to know him a little bit personally, some personal

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:46.920
details about who he is and what he does and other things.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:50.520
He's got a family, which is great because it tells me he's on the right side of things

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.000
and he loves his family very much as you should.

01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:00.160
And that kind of gave me hope that, okay, this guy actually is taking that into consideration,

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.160
which tells me everything.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:06.320
And his body language was also what conveyed it to me too because he's very fidgety with

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.320
his watch.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.600
He's kind of like trying to adjust himself and it's like, okay, I know you're telling

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:14.480
the truth because this is making you uncomfortable as much as it is making me.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.040
And there was also sort of an apology that he gave to you.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:20.040
Yes, he did.

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.040
Can you talk about that a little bit?

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.600
He apologized saying that he's sorry that we went through that, that it's absolutely

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.760
unnecessary and it's bullshit and that shouldn't be happening to anybody.

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.560
And he knows of instances where they, yes, they have murdered people, not him directly,

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.600
but he will never kill a patriot.

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.400
He will never kill innocent people, but that guy will murder and kill bad guys as it should

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.480
be because he's like a sheepdog.

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.880
And all of these guys that I'm working with are the same way.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.680
They're all good people.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:50.320
And some people have had confusion to say, oh, we're, we're, how the gunpoint with these

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.600
guys and all of a sudden they're welcoming me in and, and giving me this, this knowledge

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:55.600
and trust.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.080
No, it's not the same people.

01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:58.080
These are the good guys.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.080
Very few.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.520
So these guys weren't involved with the operation you witnessed in 2009.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.520
No, they were not.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.120
But they are aware of those types of.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120
Yes.

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:10.440
And they've been on similar operations as that to my understanding.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:13.880
And so he showed you some things.

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:14.880
Yes.

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.640
You've said you went underground.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.640
I can't talk about any of this.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:19.640
Okay.

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:24.320
I don't, I don't, I'm not going to ask you what you saw.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:30.240
What I, what I want to ask you is why did he show you that in the sense of?

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:36.400
What, what you could ask is what the things that he has been able to show you were proof.

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.640
It was a way of him able to prove who he said, who he really was.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.280
That's exactly what I was.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.560
It wasn't like I can just take his word and just say, okay, I trust you.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:52.000
It was a way for them to say, these are the real deal guys.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.080
Because it's not like anybody can just see this shit.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:59.360
And I hope one day I can get to a point where I can talk about that.

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:02.400
And because it is, it is mind blowing.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.800
And I thought what I witnessed on, in 14, 15 years ago was mind blowing.

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.280
Yes, it is.

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.120
But now you actually see things face to face of what, you know.

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:25.560
Because, I'll put it this way, that facility, if these guys were to link up with two politicians

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:32.480
and then give them a free access card to everything, it would single-handedly blow the doors

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:40.640
off of this whole chicanery of misinformation and all the lies and all the deceit that are

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:41.640
being there.

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.640
This would prove everything.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.280
They're doing that right now, but they're trying to plan it out.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.560
And what way I don't know, but that's what their goal is.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:57.760
And I can't give any details about that being mic'd up and all this, but I can tell you otherwise.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.160
But they're upset.

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.080
A lot of them are upset.

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:08.520
I guess what I'm getting at is like, what's their objective with this?

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:14.280
With reaching out to you and informing this partnership or relationship with you, what

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:16.200
is their ultimate motive?

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:22.360
Because these are people who are first-hand participants in the program.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.280
Yes, for 30-plus years.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280
Yeah.

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:29.280
And so their pro-disclosure to a certain extent?

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:31.720
Pro-American, pro-freedom, pro-life.

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.000
You know, obviously they don't like that people are being murdered over this kind of stuff.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.280
So there's kind of factions within...

01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:42.880
Yes, that's exactly what people call the program, and these are kind of considered the good

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:52.160
guys who want to support some level of disclosure and restore an oversight by Congress.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:58.760
So the other reason is that these guys were somewhat tasked to try to go through us or

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.960
infiltrate, right?

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.960
I think what would have happened is these guys would have been whistleblowers or considered

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.960
whistleblowers themselves.

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:12.240
Not in a public fashion like I'm doing or anybody else that's in my shoes.

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:19.960
But I think what happened was now that I came forward and what I experienced is directly

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:24.800
related and directly involved with what they've been doing, it was more of a chance for them

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:30.120
to say, okay, we can lay low, but now we have a spokesperson for us that can get this information

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.560
out and help us get information out to the right people.

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:37.520
And that was successful and they'll be able to do that.

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.920
But I was also successful and able to get them in contact with certain other prominent

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.920
people.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:46.000
Do these guys, these insiders have any fear of coming forward?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.400
I personally have talked to some whistleblowers who are allegedly afraid to speak because

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:54.560
they will lose pension, they will basically, they and their family will not have a way

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:55.560
to provide.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:01.760
Yes, they will lose everything if this is not done correctly and carefully.

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.760
And again, I don't know if these guys are coming forward.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:07.640
I can't specifically say that, I don't know.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.480
I just, maybe one day they will.

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480
Who knows?

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:21.280
What do you think needs to happen or if you can convey what these guys have said, what

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:27.120
needs to happen or change in order for more first-hand participants like them to be able

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.480
to come forward, what needs to happen?

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.720
The tables need to flip as far as the, the majority of these people in these programs

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.120
are good people.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.520
That's what I, from my own interactions with some of these people, granted I'm not working

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.360
with everybody, right?

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.240
But the ones that I know very well now, they're good people, they got their heart in the right

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.020
place and they got the right mindset for this.

01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:54.080
What would need to happen is that the tables need to turn as far as them flipping the tables

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.600
on their own programs, meaning taking control of them personally, getting the bad guys or

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:04.520
neutralizing that, however, because what people need to understand is that this group is the

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:10.760
enforcement arm of even the political corruption that's going on because they have assets in

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:17.720
certain places in government, local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, military, everywhere.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:23.120
So if they were able to single-handedly take the bad guys out or flip the script or gain

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:29.120
control of that, because right now there's a war between the good and bad of these factions.

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:32.960
The bad guys want to keep this secret and they want to keep this technology to themselves

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:37.920
and they want to commit crimes against humanity with this technology and have this power and

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:43.000
control while the good guys want this to come forward and everybody benefit from it and

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.320
us as a species be able to survive.

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.840
Also the fact that they know directly what is going on because they're living in this

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.840
world.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:53.720
Day-to-day job, so to speak.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.200
So I think now that they have an opportunity to understand that this is affecting other

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:04.880
people besides me, besides, I mean, it's affecting all of us because we could be, we could really

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:14.280
be far in life with this technology and not only that, we could stop shooting down NHI

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:22.760
because who's to say, I've never met any of them, I don't know any ETs or NHI, I can't,

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.160
never came face to face with them.

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:30.760
What I can tell you is that I know that the universe is massive and there's multi-dimensional

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:35.640
universes or however this works with the theories that people have proposed and if that really

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:41.200
is the case, the possibility that we can come across a species that ain't going to be too

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.760
friendly with us is a possibility.

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:48.400
So you're telling, and this is what the concept is, so this group is going to target them,

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:57.080
shoot them down in the deserts, all over the world, in secluded areas and they are going

01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:02.920
to come across at a point maybe someday that they're going to shoot down the wrong type

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:07.480
and maybe that type becomes a type that decides that, hey, you know what, we don't need these

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:12.960
people around, we don't need this species around and they decide that we as people

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:20.960
who don't even partake in that nonsense have to pay for it, meaning that our lives end

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:26.800
as they can instantly do it if they wanted to with what I have been told and what I've

01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:32.800
understand how powerful they are if they're able to travel inter-dimensionally and through

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:36.640
time and space and be able to show up here and go to any other place that they want to

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:43.640
go and be able to control craft through consciousness and be able to pretty much, the way that they

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:48.080
even said that, and this is just speculation of course because I've never seen this personally,

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.680
but the way that they are actually able to be go through things, be inter-dimensional

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.800
so it can be in 3D or just have the image of, but they can also pass through solid objects

01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:01.040
like it's almost them, their molecules or atoms splitting between all of those to separate

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:07.120
them somehow, so that's just speculation, but that's what I've been told.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.160
And so if you have something that advanced and some very smart that can end our lives,

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.280
this whole planet if they wanted to, and for some reason they choose not to, but yet we

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:22.360
keep shooting them down, and that means us as a human species.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.000
So you described kind of the next step forward is for the good guys to kind of flip the tables

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:34.120
on the bad guys, but what about the whole side of like legislation? Is that still an important

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.280
factor?

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:44.960
Well that allows certain things to happen to where there's involvement from both sides

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:50.160
because there's laws that have to be abided by, there has to be military involvement to

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:56.660
an extent, and there also has to be a law enforcement effort because essentially there's

01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:00.060
a lot of laws being broken with all of these, and that's kind of the thing that maybe they

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:03.580
can get them on a technicality to get some laws passed that now all of a sudden these

01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:08.100
guys can't hide within that because now there's proof that there's stuff going on that the

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.420
law enforcement like U.S. Marshals for example, because they have jurisdiction everywhere,

01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:17.820
it could be the ones to execute whatever they need to, that's just technically speaking.

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:24.740
And what about like how can we get more people like the insiders you're working with to come

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:29.980
forward? Are there, you know, there seems to be kind of like, yeah, we have whistleblower

01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:32.580
protection, but it's really not enough.

01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:35.020
It's really not enough, and that's exactly their concern.

01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:39.580
Yeah, so what do they think needs to be done from that aspect?

01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:44.260
These politicians need to get their shit together, and they can't be corrupt like we're seeing

01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:48.420
with the whole pushback of the M&N domain and all that kind of stuff because these aerospace

01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:52.100
companies are paying some of these guys. So of course, hey, we'll throw you an X amount

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:56.180
of money if you play ball for us and make it to where it's hard for them to accomplish

01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.860
what they want because then all of a sudden the game's up.

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:02.020
These aerospace companies know what's going on. They're going to pretend that they don't,

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:06.500
but they have access to this shit. And it may not even be the executives of these companies

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:10.580
who know what's going on, but the contractors and the people that are within these groups

01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.060
know exactly what's going on and have access to it.

01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:18.020
And it's a very, it's relatively a small number. It's not like every single Boeing personnel

01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:24.780
or a Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or Northrop Grumman for that matter would have, every single

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:29.260
person knows what's going on. They don't. Only certain groups in that do.

01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:33.060
And to touch quickly on what you were talking about about shooting down these craft, are

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:37.300
you aware of in the program with these insiders if there's kind of an ethical tug of war going

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:38.300
on that?

01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:39.300
100%.

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:40.300
Okay.

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:44.980
And that's kind of why they feel the need to want to divulge information to me to spread

01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:48.740
it to you guys and to the world for that matter.

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:53.540
The other aspect of it too is over these installations that civilian aircraft are being targeted as

01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:58.020
well when they're flying into these temporary flight restricted areas or TFRs.

01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.820
And it's in people, they will go for a flight, want to go see some scenic views of some of

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:06.340
these areas that are beautiful nearby, but happen to stumble into the area just like we

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:12.900
did at the wrong point of time. And now they get hit with these experimental weapons. Well,

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:17.460
you can't even call them experimental because they're using them. They're not known. They're

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.900
relatively, yeah.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:23.500
Are you aware of what these offensive UAP weapons are, how they work?

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:28.700
I can't give specifics to it. It's a lot of them. I've only been, I only know of a few,

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:31.860
but as far as the other ones that are more cutting edge, because like again, they keep

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:36.180
refining their systems because they want to make sure that they can just take them out

01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:42.820
with a single hit and have an easier time doing it, I would suppose. That's just speculation,

01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:47.780
but they're always refining their stuff. They're always refining their reverse engineer

01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:52.620
technologies as well, which is why they test these weapons systems on them. So they had

01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:58.380
to explain that they put them, they put craft on balloons, have them go up to high altitude

01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:02.140
and then they hit them with these weapons because there's nobody aboard, right? And

01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:05.220
then they also have them stationary on the ground and they can hit them at different

01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:14.660
angles to make sure that it's, but what they have explained to me was that their EMP proof,

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:21.660
what they have, they are, they are not vulnerable to any kind of modern ammunition like rifle

01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:28.020
bullets or 50 cal machine gun ammo or ammunition or rounds. Missiles can't penetrate through

01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:29.020
their weapons.

01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:30.020
You're talking about UAP?

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.020
That they have, yes.

01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.020
Okay.

01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.020
They meaning?

01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:34.020
Yes.

01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.020
That they've designed and made.

01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:36.020
Oh, okay.

01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:41.020
So like the ARV reverse engineer, okay.

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:45.140
Yes. Most of the ones that are coming out, and this is what some of the insiders had

01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:52.740
said. They are having a very hard time distinguishing the real craft from NHI compared to the ones

01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:58.580
that they've got. That's how far they've came with this technology. They can't identify

01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:01.500
one from the other. It's getting to that point.

01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:07.820
So it's practically been a year, almost within a week since you came forward.

01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:08.820
Correct.

01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:16.620
What's next for you? Has your motivation for coming forward now changed? Has your objective

01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:22.940
now changed now that you've met with the insider and kind of gotten involved with that side?

01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:28.940
Yes it has because I feel like I can now help these guys in any way that I possibly can.

01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:33.140
I've been doing that behind the scenes and it's good. It feels good to do that. It feels

01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:37.380
good to be on the right set of history with this and when everything does come to a head,

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:42.100
hopefully there can be some positive movements that blow this all wide open and we can all

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.380
benefit. We could all be better people at the end of the day. That's what I want. That's

01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:46.820
my mission.

01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:51.140
The other aspect is obviously being provided the information that people are being taken

01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:56.900
and used in these programs. That doesn't sit well with me. When I heard that, I couldn't

01:58:56.940 --> 01:59:00.420
sleep for a week. There's many times where I've hidden in the bathroom and literally

01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:05.100
busted down fucking crime because it's like, I couldn't do anything to stop that at that

01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:12.100
time, which sucks to know that. You're completely helpless. So I feel like it's my mission

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.660
to get the right oversight to an extent and maybe there can be things that can happen

01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:23.740
on a global scale that get these programs to be known programs and maybe the right ways

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:27.820
can be done with these where people don't have to be sedated. People don't have to be

01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:32.980
treated as if they're biological equipment or pink assets, as they call them, that they

01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:38.420
can actually have people gain a foothold and do this peacefully and make us all better

01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:45.300
people and everybody can live happily. Everybody can live evolved. We can stop paying utilities

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:50.100
because free energy will be a thing. Maybe I got fast cars, but maybe I can get some

01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:54.940
faster shit that I can drive around or fly around in for that matter. However, that comes

01:59:54.940 --> 02:00:01.940
about. But I think what the optimism is that our world can be significantly better, but

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:09.620
we have to go through some very hard times for this to happen. I don't have children,

02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:14.380
but I know you do and I know that your children do benefit from having a better world that

02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:18.020
they can grow up and experience and not have to go through the corruption and see what

02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:22.780
we're dealing with as people right now who understand what's going on. And I know these

02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:28.340
insiders families also deserve the same. Like I said, I don't want any money from this.

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:33.100
All I want is for this to come forward. All I want is this world to get better and change.

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:40.100
That's my mission. Anybody who has any problems with me not accepting money? Tough shit.

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:45.620
I make my own money. I'm not bought and paid for like most of these people who try to keep

02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:49.780
this shit hidden or secret or threaten them. They can threaten me all they want, but all

02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:54.460
it's doing is pissing us off and get us pissed off enough. And we actually do something that

02:00:54.460 --> 02:01:00.460
actually, because here's the problem. As much as I would like to say or believe me, everybody,

02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:06.380
because what I'm saying can be verified to an extent, which I choose not to because I'm

02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:13.380
keeping people safe in the process, as you guys know, but be skeptical.

02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:20.140
Because there are people coming forward who should not be or they're muddying the waters

02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:24.820
to an extent and they're very known people. I don't get in drama of this shit. I don't

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:29.580
care to. I've got my direction of where I'm going and that's what I'm focused on. I let

02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:35.140
other people gossip and talk while I'm just focused. So that's what they can do. People

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:38.820
need to understand that yes, as much as I want people to believe what I'm saying, but

02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:43.460
at the end of the day, disclosure is about evidence. It's not about testimony. It's not

02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:47.780
about what I say. If I had proof.

02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:51.300
So you think evidence is coming at some point?

02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:57.100
Very much so. How it will happen, I have no idea. But I hope it does and I hope it comes

02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:00.740
full force because then it's going to kind of catch a lot of people with their pants

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:04.580
down. People who pretend in the government that they don't know what's going on, but

02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:09.660
they fully will do because they're getting paid from it under the table. So it's going

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:13.980
to be interesting how, oh yeah, you didn't know that this existed, but here's some documentation

02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:18.140
or some people are saying that you were being paid for it. But yet they got this material

02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:23.940
or whatever it is that they have that's actually out. And now people know for a fact, oh shit,

02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:30.020
NHIRT exists guys. And we've had access to this and we've been in communication to an

02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.460
extent for a very long time.

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:38.380
And I just got to ask two quick closing questions if you don't mind. I think it was on the Total

02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:43.580
Disclosure podcast. You talked about that you had been in contact with David Grush. Can

02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:45.180
you comment on that?

02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:47.580
I've talked to him and that's all I can say.

02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.060
Okay. And two, this is just kind of a personal one because I've seen this bounced around

02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:57.020
a lot. I have seen many people call you Joey and Joey your publicist. You two are not the

02:02:57.020 --> 02:03:00.220
same person. And Joey, are you Michael's publicist?

02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:01.220
Not at all.

02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:03.860
Are you anything other than a private citizen who's investigating Michael's case?

02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.180
Just a random guy.

02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:06.460
Are you paid for by Michael?

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:07.460
No.

02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:08.460
Oh man.

02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:09.460
Yeah.

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:13.340
I know. I can imagine that's the skepticism going on.

02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:21.180
It's just like Reddit. Most people are just anonymous on Reddit. And I just remained anonymous

02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:26.180
and now I'm showing my face now for the first time and just trying to crack that open a

02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:27.180
little bit.

02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:28.180
Yeah.

02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:31.780
Well, I mean, there'll be a right time where everything can be divorced and everybody can

02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:36.140
sleep better, you know? But I just saw what you were doing on Reddit and it's like, you

02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:39.820
know what? You're a very good person to get information out. I don't know anybody else.

02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:44.940
And thanks to you, thanks to you, you've been able to link me up with people who have.

02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:45.940
That's true too.

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:46.940
Yeah.

02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.700
You're very good at networking too. And that's part of the reason why I'm successful is

02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:54.100
because networking is key. And that's, I use the same approach with disclosure. So if

02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:58.700
I'm in touch with people who are pivotal with this movement, then I'm able to contribute

02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:03.380
in ways that I possibly can to bring this forward to an extent or however far we can

02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:08.020
get. And you introduced me to him, you know, which is great because you guys are wonderful

02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:12.820
guys, very good people, you know? So it's good talking to you guys and just even shooting

02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:16.100
a shit when we're not talking about this kind of stuff, you know?

02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:18.820
I can't believe we're sitting here and this is just.

02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:19.820
I know.

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:20.820
It's been a long time coming.

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:24.060
It's been a long time. I'm like, you know, if I had time to go out there, I'd definitely

02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:28.340
go out there and see where, you know, what your part of the world is like and see what

02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:30.340
you do day to day and you get to experience.

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:32.740
You certainly keep busy with everything that you've got to do.

02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:37.500
Yeah. I'm surprised I'm not completely bald yet. It's getting there, but I got some hymns

02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:42.620
I'm trying. So hopefully that helps. But, you know, if not, then I'm just going to be

02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.620
another whistleblower that's bald.

02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:45.620
Yeah, dude. Rock it.

02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:53.620
Well, this was awesome. I'm, you know, so grateful that you sat down with us and just,

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:58.180
yeah, excited to kind of see how things unfold moving forward.

02:04:58.180 --> 02:05:05.180
Well, from what I kind of understand, it may be pivotal to a point where we get to grip

02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:10.700
on the right way and it comes forward and everybody understands. It doesn't have to

02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:11.460
be secret anymore.
