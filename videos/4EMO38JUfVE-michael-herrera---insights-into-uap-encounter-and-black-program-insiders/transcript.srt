00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
What's going on guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so much for joining me for this in-person

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,760
interview with UMC Vet and Arrow whistleblower Michael Herrera.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,020
Before we get into this interview, there's just a couple things I want to touch on.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,980
I co-hosted this interview with my good friend Joey is not my name.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,080
Many of you will remember him from my first video on Michael or have seen him around Reddit

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,580
and Twitter as one of the first people to really start investigating Michael's claims

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,600
of his experience in 2009 in Indonesia seriously.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
When we sat down to conduct this interview, we sought to really ask some of the lesser

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,040
asked questions and lesser known details of Michael's encounter in 2009 and his claims

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,720
of meeting a Black program insider.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,680
So we do kind of expect you to be somewhat familiar with Michael's story, at least know

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,880
the base details of his 2009 experience and his follow-up claims.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,580
If you haven't, I highly recommend checking out my original video on Michael that I did

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,520
with Joey or watch his Sean Ryan show podcast appearance.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,240
Both are fantastic videos, I highly recommend checking them out.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,760
If you're not too familiar with Michael's story, if you'll remember back to my Marines

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,360
and UFOs video, you'll recall this is the first time I ever covered Michael's story

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
and I was super dismissive of him, super skeptical.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,760
That's why after all these months of talking to Joey, talking to Michael, sharing meals

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,560
with Michael, hosting Joey and conducting this interview, I'm super excited to revisit

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,240
this case as it's one I've been privately investigating on my own for quite a while.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,960
So without further ado, please enjoy this interview with Joey is not my name and Michael

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Herrera.

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
So you guys get to the top of the hill and of course this is when you observe this object.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
Who, which part of your team first observed this?

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,680
It had to have been, it wasn't me, it was somebody else and they were more pointing

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,480
like, what is that?

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,160
And so this was a big misconception for me at first, Joey had to kind of help me visualize

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,200
this as I'm sure it was for a lot of other people too.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,320
You guys only saw the top triangular section and some lights of this.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,240
Not really lights, lights didn't happen until the thing actually took off.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,440
But you can see, I mean, if you're going to try to think that these are two trees, right?

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,280
And that's kind of like where you can see the top part of it, but then you see the other

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,840
part, but you can't make out the whole size of it, right?

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Because you have trees and everything distorting it.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,120
So really only we saw was something changing colors often this little thing that I had

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,120
visual on and you see it moving around.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,000
It's like, it's not a building.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,920
I mean, we thought it was a building at a point, but I mean, it's just off in the distance

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,520
right there and it's changing colors and something that you have green vegetation sticks out like

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
a sore thumb.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,720
It's easier to say if it was a building because I mean, you'd expect kind of buildings to

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
be in that area, but this area didn't have any of those buildings, didn't have anything

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
like that.

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,800
So who made the decision to kind of go forward and check this out?

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
It wasn't me.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,880
And it was the person in charge and that's who was the one that did that.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,800
As you approach the object, you could only still see just above the tree line, the top

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
of the object.

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
You could see the whole thing.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,480
Yeah, so when we got down that hill and it was something we weren't allowed to do obviously

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,680
because you're not supposed to abandon your, whatever your post is.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,320
Yeah, I'm curious about that.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Can you describe what was going on at the LZ at the time where you guys decided, I mean,

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,720
to make this decision, this risky decision to go and check out whatever this was?

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,240
So I don't remember much going on at the LZ.

57
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,400
I just remember taking video of that helicopter that was off in the distance.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,040
It wasn't like it was super close.

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,280
Did you guys feel like that helicopter was part of your responsibility to guard or was

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
it like?

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,920
I just assumed that there probably was other people there or probably other Marines on

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,560
board that they were probably dropping off in that area.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
That would be my assumption.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,400
I don't remember thinking anything like that back then, you know, 14, 15 years ago.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,640
Yeah, I mean, I can imagine, you know, whatever you guys saw.

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,320
Well, something that wasn't, it was abnormal and, you know, yeah, curiosity is a good thing

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
to an extent.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,560
But I tell people all the time, curiosity is what kills a cat.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,520
And it's something in this way that it changed our lives.

70
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,960
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't a light decision.

71
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,640
It was a risky decision and you guys made the choice and, I mean, we didn't even rack

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
around in the chamber.

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,040
It's just like we weren't expecting to really get into anything like that.

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
You know, it was just walking down, trying to see what that is.

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
And then if it wasn't nothing, we're just going to go back up the hill and resume to

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
what we were doing.

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,480
And obviously it led to what we experienced.

78
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,080
When you're walking, you know, you guys are at the top of the hill.

79
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
The decision is made to go check this thing out.

80
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,120
And at the top of the hill, you don't actually see any people.

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,160
You didn't see those, the trucks yet.

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,240
You're just seeing the top of the craft.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,480
So you guys go down the moment of interception with these guys.

84
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,840
Can you describe?

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,760
I think, I think what gets lost on a lot of people is how fast it happened and how quickly

86
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,840
they took control of the situation.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,320
I mean, what was your first impression when you saw these guys?

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,800
Well, I heard people yelling at us.

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
That's what got my attention.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And when we saw weapons in their hands pointed at us, you're not going to move, you're not

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,320
going to raise your weapon up because obviously that's the point.

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,360
And then obviously, and during the briefing, I had touched on in numerous interviews that

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,680
there was a possible SEAL team that was out there trying to handle things that they were

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
tasked on.

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,640
What they were specifically doing, I don't know.

96
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,520
But I remember in the ward room that that's what they were talking about, having some

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,480
sort of element of US Navy SEALs there.

98
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,800
And for a second, we thought it may have been them and we're just like, oh, shit, here's

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
these guys.

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,800
You know, they don't, then obviously we were going to talk or something or just go, but

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,100
these guys were not, these guys were not carrying themselves as SEALs and they didn't have anything

102
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,960
identifying on them.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,000
And obviously they were screaming at us, telling us to put our weapons, you know, put our hands

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,780
up in the air because we had slings on our stuff, right?

105
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,760
So that's when we're putting our hands up in the air and every single one of us did the

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
same thing.

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,840
It's not like, I mean, how are we going to raise a weapon that doesn't even have a full

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
chamber?

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,480
What are you going to do at that point?

110
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,560
If you even rack that round and try to bring it up, they've already got their muzzles pointed

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
at you.

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,160
It's almost like a police officer coming up to your vehicle when they do a traffic stop

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,160
and they feel threatened or they may have an indication that your vehicle matches the

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,040
description of somebody who has had a gun pointed at them, for example, where they would

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,380
believe that it's reasonable suspicion for them to deploy their firearm.

116
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,960
Are you going to move suddenly and make him think you're going to reach for something

117
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
and he just blasts you?

118
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
No.

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,640
And how did these men approach you in a tactical column, a pincer?

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,440
We were the one that was in a tactical column.

121
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,520
They had, so if I was looking at this and we kind of started, and that's when we naturally

122
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,680
kind of spread out like walking towards them, and that's when they basically had four guys

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,520
on this side and they have four guys on this side.

124
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,040
And I talked to numerous special operators about this type of tactic and they called

125
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,200
a nosebleed, which is where they have basically interlocking fields of fire with this direction

126
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
on one target.

127
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,480
It's a very rookie, easy thing to do and these guys, they already had that position.

128
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,360
So it tells me that maybe there could have been more operators that were around that

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,500
area, maybe on the other side of the craft, on the other side of where the trucks may

130
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,000
have went off, which I didn't see them go off anywhere.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But from what I've been told, there was more than just those guys there.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
So if we would have gotten into any kind of conflict, we were severely outnumbered already.

133
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,300
At what point did the craft become fully visible?

134
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,920
When we got to the bottom of the hill and we walked a little bit forward and it started

135
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,400
to clear out.

136
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,080
And that's when this thing was just sitting there.

137
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,640
And then the men approached you right after you noticed it?

138
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Correct.

139
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,320
As soon as we broke that threshold of getting into that clearing is where they basically

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,520
had us intercepted.

141
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,920
It's not like we could run behind anything because you can't.

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Right.

143
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,480
And the trees weren't like big red oak trees where you could hide behind.

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:22,120
I remember the trees probably being as big as this water bottle, at least how thick,

145
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,160
probably a little bit thicker, but that's not enough to stop anything.

146
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,840
It's not enough to hide behind and not get hit.

147
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,160
So everybody has the whole, they think they're John Wick until they're in that situation,

148
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,120
but it's like I would like to see anybody else in that situation to see what they would

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
have done.

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,640
Because knowing what type of operators we encountered now that I've already been through

151
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,880
all of this, been briefed on it, been included to an extent, none of us would have been a

152
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,280
match for those guys.

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,160
And so what did these men do as they trained the rifles on you as they approached you?

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,760
So they were pointed, they were screaming at us.

155
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,080
You could actually hear them flip everything off safe because it's not a bull click.

156
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,120
And where we were at, obviously, there's not a lot of noise coming from the hill obviously

157
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,120
because everything that's going on over there is basically silent because you have a hill

158
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,560
blocking everything.

159
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,320
And then the craft's not emitting any kind of noise except for that little hum or that

160
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
guitar amp.

161
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,960
I mean, it's not exactly like a guitar amp or like a transformer, but something similar

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
to that.

163
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,120
You actually replicated pretty good to an extent.

164
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,480
So and that wasn't as audible compared to when everything started to go on and when

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,480
they had us, because we weren't at the, where we just broke that threshold, right?

166
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,280
We actually pulled up a little bit more as they were telling us to.

167
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,840
And so they had their weapons on every single one of us.

168
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,160
And there was only six of us, there was eight of them, which means that it's easy for them

169
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,760
just to, I mean, I don't even know if their weapons are full auto.

170
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,280
And they probably could be.

171
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,280
There's or not, there are only three round bursts or semi-automatic and most of the time

172
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,200
they teach us to shoot in a semi-automatic, you know, one round per person, a kill shot

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
at least.

174
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
So, I mean, it's not a head shot.

175
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
I mean, you have a T-Box and what you're trained for combat marksmanship, but these guys could

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
have full automatic M4s.

177
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,080
I wouldn't have rolled it out, you know, which means that they just need to, each person

178
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,520
doing a couple round bursts, three to five round bursts, I mean, it's going to get everybody

179
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
where we were at.

180
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:24,320
Now, one thing that people bring up is, you know, you did have, you had your camera,

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
at the top of the hill, you actually got some pictures of what you guys were seeing.

182
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,280
I remember at least a couple of photographs, but I remember a video as well.

183
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
That's right.

184
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,920
I remember a video and that's when I had a dump pouch, which all of us did have a dump

185
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,280
pouch, but I had it right here all the time and that's where we basically put expended

186
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,560
magazines because you're not going to drop them because you have to reuse them.

187
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,720
So it also helped, too, if you had carry extra ammo because if you had some malfunction

188
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,640
or sometimes we use the saws with, because my had regular saw drum pouches on my stuff,

189
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,120
where I could put a drum here and a drum here and then I had grenade pouches up here.

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,440
And most of the time, I would just put magazines and whatever the easiest side to reach was

191
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
and that's basically what I had.

192
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,920
So we didn't have like M4 or M16 pouches.

193
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,640
I had saw drum pouches where I had all the mags in, which we had a combat load, six mags.

194
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
They disarmed you, right?

195
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Yes.

196
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,240
That was kind of their first, like once they approached you, you described how they were

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
very methodical and how they did that.

198
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,920
They wanted to gain control of the situation, which they had that control, right, but they're

199
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,680
going to sleep better because they took our weapons from us and slung them and going through

200
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
making sure that we had our magazines out.

201
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,640
It wasn't like they were spending us like some law enforcement officer checking you,

202
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
tracking around your ankles, anything like that.

203
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,960
They're not doing that.

204
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,480
The only thing that they searched us with was our military IDs where they knew they were

205
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,920
at, which is what my suspicion was that these guys were former military at some point because

206
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,560
they knew exactly where our IDs were.

207
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
And you said they interacted with your IDs with something that what we would recognize

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,840
today as a modern day smartphone.

209
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Yes.

210
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,520
So they had something that I referred to as a bat system that we were trained on, which

211
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,000
is like a biometrics and tracking system.

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,400
It could be the acronym for it, but I just remember saying bats.

213
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,260
And they tried that first.

214
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,080
So they put that away and they had these things.

215
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,040
I mean, it wasn't like, because iPhones were kind of bulky back in the day and they had

216
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,560
blackberries and I had a Sony Ericsson MP3 phone that was pretty bulky.

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,160
And they had something that was really thin.

218
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
And that's what they were using.

219
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,160
So it could have been something that was comparable, but then again, I don't know.

220
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,240
So while you're getting searched, the craft is in the background.

221
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,680
For anybody that hasn't heard you describe this craft, can you tell us what it looks

222
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
like?

223
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,680
So I remember as, because there was corners, which means to me it was an octagonal shape.

224
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,640
Actually, could you, would you mind drawing it for us?

225
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Let's see.

226
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I got pens over here.

227
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Let me, yeah, let's...

228
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,200
I like that idea.

229
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
That would be cool.

230
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
And you know what?

231
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm going to move.

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
All right.

233
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,880
So what did this thing, what did this craft look like?

234
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Okay.

235
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,960
So this is going from our point of view, right?

236
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
That I can remember.

237
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
So I'm just going to say this is like vegetation, right?

238
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,680
And this is to represent that clearing.

239
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,160
What I remember is kind of like a pyramid shape at the top like this, because I remember

240
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,280
seeing some shading and some were kind of brighter than others.

241
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Like this.

242
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:30,440
Then I remember it doing like this and then it had corners, right?

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,080
This may be looking a little bit strange, but this is just a rough draft.

244
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,400
It used to be a better artist back in the day.

245
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,360
And I remember seeing these vents, at least that's what it looks like on each of the corners

246
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
like this.

247
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:51,080
So there's a vent here, and it was like it was positioned on the lines, like this.

248
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,960
And then on each corner, when this thing took off, it had lights that would pop on, which

249
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,800
would have been like red, yellow, green, and blue are the only ones I remember that kind

250
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,400
of had a line that went like this.

251
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:13,240
And it had some sort of scale pattern that I estimate is octagonal, but it could honestly

252
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,080
be circular, it could be square.

253
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:24,280
I wasn't close enough to depict it, but this is where this was the blackest, darkest thing

254
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,960
that I have ever seen in my life.

255
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
It's almost like light got absorbed into this, and I don't know if this is just because

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
of the craft.

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,560
It may help with a function, but there's probably third graders or something that say they can

258
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,400
probably do a better job than this, and I'd probably agree with them.

259
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,040
So now what about the platform?

260
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,200
Platform underneath was kind of like it was raised like this, not off the ground, but

261
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,440
just like an incline.

262
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,920
And it went underneath like this, and it was around the same kind of length as a craft,

263
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,360
and it had kind of some points on it as well, which obviously it fits under the craft when

264
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,840
we saw that happen.

265
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:11,120
And it wasn't like where we were at, I would say this is approximately even the same distance

266
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
as it was.

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,240
There was not like there was any light or materials on here that I remember seeing.

268
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,680
But then you have, I'm going to draw stick figures.

269
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,240
So I'm just going to draw them black, because these are black team guys.

270
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:35,480
I know this is not a van Gogh or a Mona Lisa drawer, but I'm just trying to gather everybody's

271
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,960
attention to see how, what I can recall as this and all these guys, and we were essentially

272
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,800
in this area kind of online, four, five, six, right?

273
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,480
We weren't like evenly spaced out, but you guys can kind of see how there's six of us,

274
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,680
there's eight of them, they've got good field of view.

275
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,360
We can see this going on the background, and I'm going to draw a line through this, but

276
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,520
basically where the directions or the trucks came from were from our left.

277
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,360
So they're coming up and then they would go like this.

278
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,840
I don't remember seeing them go off the platform and going somewhere else.

279
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,960
I just remember them going on here, but then we're also facing the fact that we're dealing

280
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,920
with these guys at the same time.

281
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,080
So our focus is going back and forth.

282
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,000
One, you don't see anything that looks like that ever.

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,680
Two, you're not in a situation where that happens either.

284
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,320
So as I wish there was more details that I can remember aside from that, but that is

285
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,800
what I briefly recall as far as what the craft looked like.

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,760
Besides changing colors from a light matte gray to a dark matte black, the whole thing.

287
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,680
And so before this craft took off, what did this platform do?

288
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,880
So this craft kind of sunk down a little bit like this.

289
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,000
This platform itself raised up.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,880
And there were trucks and other crates?

291
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't remember seeing the trucks.

292
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,840
They could have been because where we were at, and mind you, I didn't see it as it started

293
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,640
going up.

294
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,600
I saw it when we were going back and forth, and the only thing that got my attention and

295
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm sure it got everybody else's attention, and I'm only speaking from my point of view

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,480
was the only thing that got my attention was something was moving.

297
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,120
And because your eyes are used to attract movement, right?

298
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,900
It's just something that gets your attention.

299
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,600
So when I saw that raising up, it was already, what I'd estimate, over R, if we're only

300
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,200
5, 10 to 6 feet tall, it was probably almost 10 feet off the ground.

301
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,920
Did it raise rapidly or in kind of a slow motion?

302
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,120
Not super rapid.

303
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,360
It was enough to kind of be slow, but still enough to where you could catch it.

304
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,840
I don't remember seeing any kind of containers going up with it or trucks or nothing.

305
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,760
I just remember seeing the front profile, the truck, with a trailer behind it, and that

306
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,320
was why I was able to see that cylinder in front of that container.

307
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's get another piece of paper and draw the trucks.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
And actually, I want to show you this too.

309
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,000
That drawing is going to be worth a lot of money someday.

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, yeah.

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Keep that.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let me do this.

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, get the signature.

314
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Cool.

315
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,840
This is probably my favorite part of the interview.

316
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
You drawing this stuff?

317
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
It's awesome.

318
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I feel like I'm in kindergarten right now.

319
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Showing off your colors.

320
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
It shapes that you recognize.

321
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:28,560
But it's cool because it helps you kind of describe, as you're doing it, you know.

322
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,320
All right, so, all right, trucks.

323
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,080
All right, so what are these trucks, the containers with them?

324
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,320
Could you describe those?

325
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Yeah.

326
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
Like I said, I only saw it from certain profiles.

327
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
And what I remember distinctly with these, I don't remember seeing like a Ford logo or

328
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,240
nothing like a Chevy Duramax on the hood or nothing like that.

329
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,520
We obviously were kind of far away in comparison to that.

330
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,360
So I'm going to draw three different views or profiles, which I remember seeing these

331
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
trucks.

332
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,960
So the first one's going to be as if it was coming towards us.

333
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,800
So there's going to be like a headlight here.

334
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,040
There's like a grill, right, a bumper.

335
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,440
And I had like a, I remember having like kind of like a hitch is what I'm assuming.

336
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,720
And then, there's another headlight here.

337
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:30,680
Again, I'm going to apologize ahead of time that this isn't going to be, I remember seeing.

338
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,320
Now, when you say you didn't see logos, like you didn't see Ford or Chevy, but you stated

339
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,360
what kind of trucks they were, though, recognize the body style.

340
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Yeah.

341
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,080
And I would say that their Ford F 350s is what I would assume they were.

342
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,480
Did you just say that Uncigno was black dollar or gotcha?

343
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,880
What I do recall seeing is I had like these things on the sides here, kind of like vents,

344
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,920
but they're not really vents.

345
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,840
And it's kind of remind me of what they had on military hummers for night vision.

346
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,040
So that's kind of what they had on there, which tells me that they run these at night

347
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,560
time as well.

348
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,640
And these were like big, aggressive off-road tires, right?

349
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,840
Truck bed, okay.

350
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,160
You can kind of see these cases, which are Pelican cases on the back.

351
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,560
And what are Pelican cases for anybody who doesn't know?

352
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,440
I mean, it's a brand, but these are weapons, because we had the same ones that we transport

353
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
weapons with.

354
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
And that's just...

355
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
Do they carry small arms, munitions?

356
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,240
Yeah, stuff like that.

357
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:47,120
So then this was hooked to a trailer that had four wheels like this, okay, trailer.

358
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:56,320
And the only thing I remember seeing of this container, I had the ridges kind of like

359
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,560
a shipping container, but not much.

360
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,600
I had the cylinder that's kind of on the front right here.

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,400
So I wanted to show you this.

362
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,440
Let me just throw this right in front of that, so that camera gets it.

363
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,640
What do you think of that?

364
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
Looks identical, but then again...

365
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,960
Now, the other thing...

366
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,240
I remember seeing it having four or two tires on each side, right?

367
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
So a dual axle, yep.

368
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,840
So this was another thing I found where they actually have the Connex box on top of it.

369
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,280
With more aggressive tires, but this looks shockingly familiar.

370
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Because that's like the type of...

371
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,880
I mean, that's a shipping crate, you know?

372
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,680
I think this is called a TriCon configuration, so they're all standardized, like the sizes

373
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,960
and stuff.

374
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
And these were outfitted.

375
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,360
They had these cylinders on the front right here that would come to find out it's actually

376
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
oxygen supply.

377
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Yeah.

378
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,840
So draw those cylinders.

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Okay.

380
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,640
So I'm going to black it out completely because the cylinder itself was black, and that's why...

381
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,760
And initially, when you saw this, you hypothesized this might be humidity control for something

382
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
like drugs.

383
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Or drugs, right?

384
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,960
That's what I testified to Aaron with, because I didn't think it was people.

385
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,120
That was in my thought process at the time.

386
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,160
And we'll talk about Aero in a little bit, but so you testified to Aero before you did

387
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,960
the NPC in June of 2023.

388
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Yes.

389
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Okay.

390
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Yep.

391
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
That was...

392
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,800
I had testified last year to Aero.

393
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
It was late April.

394
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Okay.

395
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Late April, 2023.

396
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Okay.

397
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Late April, 2023.

398
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Yep.

399
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
All right.

400
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
So that's kind of the view that...

401
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,840
That's really good.

402
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,800
So and then obviously the side view...

403
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,320
So cylinders basically spanning the whole width of the container.

404
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Yeah.

405
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Correct.

406
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
It wasn't like a small one.

407
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
It was just a whole width.

408
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Correct.

409
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
All right.

410
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,320
So here's where the tires would be from the side profile of that trailer.

411
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,760
Of course, there was no white wheel as it was all black.

412
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,840
I remember seeing kind of the back.

413
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Okay.

414
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:25,440
And then this container right here.

415
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,160
This is the cylinder from a side view.

416
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Okay.

417
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,080
Truck bed right here.

418
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,120
How many trucks total do you remember seeing?

419
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Four.

420
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Four.

421
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,840
And did each one also have weapons crates or just...

422
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Yes.

423
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Each one of them had these...

424
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,520
What you would call pelican cases.

425
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Okay.

426
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,800
But just weapons cases is what they definitely look like.

427
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,360
Were the cases opened, closed?

428
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Closed.

429
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Okay.

430
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,600
And the windows are remember being kind of dark.

431
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
So...

432
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Could you recall any other operators or people in the trucks besides just the drivers?

433
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,800
I remember one truck that went on the platform and now the door, at least some of the doors

434
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
open.

435
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
I can't recall.

436
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,400
Were there any people standing on the platforms?

437
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Yeah.

438
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
I don't remember.

439
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,020
But I don't remember seeing people on the platforms.

440
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
So that is kind of...

441
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,920
And these are black, of course, right?

442
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,120
So that's a side view of what that is, right?

443
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Okay.

444
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Which, I mean, obviously these were black, the shipping container was black, everything

445
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
like that.

446
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,000
The other profile I'm going to draw is going to be from the rear.

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,440
Did each truck have a shipping container attached to it?

448
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Yes.

449
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Okay.

450
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,280
So here's a container right here.

451
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,480
I don't remember seeing the bars.

452
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Hatch doors on the back.

453
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Yep.

454
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Like this.

455
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Okay.

456
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:58,720
Can't really see the cylinder at this point, but I'll just indicate it being there.

457
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,280
You also said that they were up armored?

458
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Yeah.

459
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
I mean, it's so...

460
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
What did you mean by that?

461
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,200
So they looked a little beefier, thicker material, you know what I mean?

462
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
Like they look like they'd be bullet resistant.

463
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Okay.

464
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,080
You can see a regular truck and they're kind of like, okay, it's a regular truck, but these

465
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,800
look like they were reinforced.

466
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,880
Kind of like a secret service car?

467
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,440
Yeah, to an extent, but...

468
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Okay.

469
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
All right.

470
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:31,640
So there's a container like that, which we're not elevated, but this is just to put perspective

471
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:38,640
of the truck and just so how we were seeing it from the back.

472
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,280
That's the only views that I remember seeing these trucks.

473
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
Because you were in front of the craft and they kind of came out in a little bit of a

474
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
circle.

475
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
The left side like this and then went up that direction.

476
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Okay.

477
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
It wasn't like they went straight.

478
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,480
They were going up to that platform.

479
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Okay.

480
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
So you see the craft.

481
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
You're basically getting weapons checked, weapons stripped from this team.

482
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,720
What happens then?

483
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
So they're going through each of us, taking our stuff.

484
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,880
They take our magazines out of our pouches and they kick them off.

485
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,680
They got one guy off in a distance that I remember was a standoff distance, like more

486
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,840
than 10 feet.

487
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,120
So obviously we tried to run and grab our stuff and he's just going to light this up

488
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
if he wanted to.

489
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,200
They had a different rifle platform to the main guys.

490
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
So same load out with all of them.

491
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
They all had the same stuff.

492
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Yeah.

493
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,680
They had the same kind of, I mean they may have different attachments, but I remember

494
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,960
most of the parts seeing ACOGs on each one of them with the PEC-16 illuminators on those.

495
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,040
Those is what I remember seeing.

496
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,320
One thing I've always been curious about, did you notice any of them like talking on

497
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
the radio to someone?

498
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
One guy had a radio and I don't remember him talking to anybody.

499
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,280
I just remember seeing it and with the antenna coming up that he had pressed to his vest.

500
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,240
But he was the main guy that was kind of telling people what to do.

501
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,960
And he was mainly the one besides another guy that was, you know, and shit, it was like

502
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
he will fucking kill you.

503
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,400
You know, it's easy to get lost out here, etc.

504
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,360
Did it seem like, you know, when they intercepted you guys, obviously there were other guys

505
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,840
in the trucks doing their thing, did you have the impression that like all of a sudden there

506
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,360
were like, oh shit, we need to wrap this up and get out?

507
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,880
Or were they kind of just not really even caring about what was going on?

508
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,400
I don't think they were kind of caring was they may have not even saw what was going

509
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
on.

510
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
They could have.

511
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
I mean, I don't know that speculation at this point.

512
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,480
Yeah, clearly we're getting into speculation there.

513
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,320
But yeah, I'm just, it's like I also think about the fact that this, you know, the earthquake,

514
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,840
you know, the whole reason this operation was there was because there was an earthquake

515
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,080
on it was the end of or the first of September or end of October.

516
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,760
It was the end of September and then I think it was September 30th, if I'm not mistaken.

517
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Don't quote me on that.

518
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Yeah.

519
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Yeah.

520
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
No, I think that's I think that's correct.

521
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,480
So and then, you know, the Denver shows up on the ninth.

522
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,280
So we're, you know, nine, 10 days after the initial earthquake and, you know, just, you

523
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,320
know, obviously speculation here, but it's like, it kind of seems weird that why would

524
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,480
this operation be occurring nine days after the earthquake?

525
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,080
You know, of course, afterwards you've kind of been told like what that operation was

526
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,160
all about and, you know, recruiting people in disaster or struck in areas.

527
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,640
But who's to say that was like maybe they had been conducting those same operations

528
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
all week long.

529
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,800
They could have been.

530
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
They could have been.

531
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,840
And believe me, those are some questions I've asked some of these gentlemen that I'm working

532
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,040
with and they, you know, they don't know because everything's compartmentalized.

533
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm hoping one day maybe one of them that I come across does know because I'm going

534
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,680
to ask him a lot of questions because I mean, I mean, just like anybody listening or watching

535
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,120
to this or anybody who wants this to come out and come forward, I'm a hundred percent

536
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
with them.

537
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,800
I want this to come full circle just like anybody else.

538
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,480
I'm just as impatient.

539
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,360
The only difference that separates me from anybody else is the experience, but also having

540
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,080
knowledge of what's going on to an extent, at least with what I've been exposed to.

541
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,560
I just have a little bit more information.

542
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,440
So you get to the point, you know, they're threatening you, they give you your weapons

543
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,960
back and tell you to go, you know, back, back up the hill, don't go back.

544
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,040
When you get to the top of the hill, what do you see happening at the LZ?

545
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,760
I just remember me because I remember once we broke the top and all of a sudden I remember

546
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,680
seeing some of our guys just start running.

547
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,720
So I'm following suit with them, right?

548
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,280
Because if anything's going to happen to us, it's going to get the attention of everybody

549
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,640
else.

550
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,480
And I remember seeing some people, but it wasn't like it was like close up.

551
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,080
I just remember when we ran back, we had our weapons strapped to our back that were very

552
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,240
tight, uncomfortably tight, right?

553
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,760
Because it's compressing your vest.

554
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,760
And remember having a gash on my right part of my neck because we had like a yoke or like

555
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,880
a collar on our vest.

556
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,840
And I remember that when they put that through that it actually kind of the slings we had

557
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,640
weren't the best quality and they're not soft.

558
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,040
They're plastic and polymer, whatever it is or cloth, whatever material they make out of

559
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
them and it's very hard.

560
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,160
So it kind of cuts you up a little bit.

561
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,640
And then I remember us getting back there and I remember seeing a couple people off in

562
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,960
the distance as far as some villagers or whoever the civilians were.

563
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,600
And there was some other military personnel.

564
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,120
I don't remember them being Marines.

565
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,080
I don't remember what, they may have been the Indonesian military could have been there,

566
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,000
but they were still off kind of at a distance compared to where we were at.

567
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,500
And there was this gunnery sergeant that was there and I've never seen this guy before.

568
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,120
I don't know if he was attached to the ship.

569
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,480
I don't know if he was brought by any other means.

570
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,880
I have never seen this guy before.

571
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,120
Now gunnery sergeant, you recognize it because you see his rank, right?

572
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,400
Now gunnery sergeant, that rank is specific to the Marines, isn't it?

573
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Correct.

574
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Okay, so when you speculate that maybe he was assigned to the ship or attached to the

575
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,240
ship I think you kind of say, what do you mean by that?

576
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:24,760
So each ship, if they're, from my understanding, again, I don't know 100%, but from my understanding

577
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,680
there are some ships that have like a combat loading group or somebody who's basically

578
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,920
loading Marine stuff onto a ship.

579
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,680
I don't know the specific, I can't remember what it's called.

580
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,800
They also have some Marines that are red patches.

581
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,880
They have a red patch on their cover and then they have red patches on some of their blouse.

582
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,800
They have some on their shoulder pocket and some on their cargo pockets.

583
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,480
And this guy didn't have those.

584
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,040
I thought I can recall anyway.

585
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,720
He may have, he may not have, I don't remember.

586
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,760
But I remember this rank because obviously it was a little hard to see it because woodlands

587
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,920
have black shapes and sometimes it distorts that and if you end up calling somebody by

588
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,160
the wrong rank you get to pay for it with pushups or get screamed at, right?

589
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,320
So which honestly, if I was in that position I would have screamed at people and tried

590
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,160
to fuck with them too for getting my rank wrong.

591
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,080
So it happens.

592
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:27,440
But when you ran back to the LZ, you were running towards the helicopter?

593
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
No.

594
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Okay.

595
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
The helicopter was not there yet.

596
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Okay.

597
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
So what's back?

598
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,800
He had a radio that he was talking with and he was communicating with whatever the pilots

599
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,960
or whoever it was.

600
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,920
So what happened when we got there, he kind of like, first of all, for security, why do

601
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,160
we have our weapons slung on our back?

602
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
That's out of place.

603
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,080
No Marines going to have that going on.

604
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,120
And that's what I think he was mainly more upset with was because that we were supposed

605
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,440
to be our weapons proper, no magazines in, you know, which obviously they put our stuff

606
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,440
in, but they put it into where it'd be very inconvenient to try to load it up and then

607
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,320
go deal with it.

608
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,760
So I think that, thinking back to that, I think that that's mainly why he was upset

609
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,880
was because, okay, well, you guys look fucked up is mainly what I would assume, right?

610
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,240
I'm just speculating at that point.

611
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,600
But I remember us stepping off to the side, off in a distance a little bit, and we're

612
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,320
basically squaring ourselves up.

613
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,280
We're taking our weapons off of each other, giving it to us, putting a magazine in and

614
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,520
having to resume the normal carry.

615
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,920
And so this gunnery sergeant is standing just in the clearing where the LZ where you guys

616
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
were dropped off.

617
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Correct.

618
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,040
Was he surrounded by a platoon of Marines or was it just this gunnery sergeant?

619
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Just him.

620
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
And other people off in the distance.

621
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
And other people off in the distance.

622
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,280
So they may have linked up and then he probably told them to go away or whatever he was doing.

623
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,720
I have no clue.

624
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,800
And then because he was on the radio, that's when CH-53 came in and picked everybody up.

625
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,880
Now on this CH-53, did you recognize the pilot?

626
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,920
Was this the same helicopter that dropped you off?

627
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,480
I don't recall any of that.

628
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,920
I just remember seeing the CH-53 and that's when it landed and we just boarded up on that

629
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
thing.

630
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I don't remember.

631
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,080
I mean, obviously our point of view, I don't remember looking at a pilot I never had a

632
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,920
chance to and it's the same thing with this.

633
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,480
I don't know specifically who was flying or what.

634
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,840
And so nobody said to the gunnery sergeant, what you guys just experienced?

635
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
No.

636
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Okay.

637
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,560
So you came to the LZ, you got off the helicopter, that helicopter left, you go to the top at

638
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,680
a certain point, a second helicopter comes at a different location, drops off supplies.

639
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,840
Was that the one that had a cargo net?

640
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Yes it did.

641
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,440
Because I took pictures and video of that coming in.

642
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:53,360
So that helicopter is dropping that net and that's when you crest the hill, kind of at

643
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,440
some point there, you crest the hill to go investigate the craft.

644
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,400
You come back, that helicopter is now gone.

645
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,360
What I'm assuming is they dropped the cargo off and then they may have landed and let

646
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
people out.

647
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,520
But by the time you came back, there was no helicopter that was there.

648
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,720
That helicopter was gone but then there was obviously the supplies that they had dropped

649
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
off.

650
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Off of the distance.

651
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,440
So do you remember seeing what was happening with any of that?

652
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Like were there people?

653
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,280
I remember seeing people over there and they could have been supplies but they were off

654
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,840
at a good distance.

655
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,200
And so where the gunnery sergeant was, was he near some supplies too?

656
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,560
If I can recall, there could have been some boxes or something he was messing with that

657
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,200
was there.

658
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,960
There may have been boxes, I don't really recall.

659
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,800
I mean, what he have even, is there a chance that he didn't even know you guys were there

660
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,440
and he was kind of like.

661
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Could have been the case.

662
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,800
Like where are you guys coming from?

663
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
What's going on?

664
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
It could have been the case.

665
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,640
I mean, like I said, I really don't know.

666
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
It's speculation.

667
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,240
But I just remember seeing a gunnery sergeant there who was like, you guys looked fucked

668
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,840
up and he was yelling at us for that reason.

669
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:20,160
And so from that period of time to when you left the LZ, you were basically just doing

670
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
what?

671
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,880
Just hanging around, waiting for the helicopter to show up?

672
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,720
And we were just kind of walking around by ourselves, of course, trying to make it look

673
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,200
like we're secure in the area.

674
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Okay.

675
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,400
So you kind of resumed that role of security?

676
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,920
Even though through our heads, we're going like, what the fuck just happened guys?

677
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,480
Were you guys discussing this amongst yourselves or was everybody pretty stone cold?

678
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
We were stone cold.

679
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Nobody wanted to talk about this.

680
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,520
Was there any point that you guys discussed it with each other?

681
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:53,040
When we got in town to Subic Bay, the only question I had asked one of them was, are

682
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,240
you going to say anything about this or tell your wife and he goes, absolutely not.

683
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,440
And that's literally it.

684
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,240
And have you encouraged these fellow Marines you were with to come forward and tell their

685
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
story to?

686
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
No.

687
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Okay.

688
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,840
They're not happy with me for obvious reasons.

689
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
I don't blame them.

690
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,800
This wasn't something that, you know, I try to get one of them to help me with this to

691
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
an extent.

692
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,920
And his response, which everybody has seen publicly, was kind of the indicator that

693
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,920
something did happen, that something was wrong.

694
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,840
And that's for people who don't know the text that was featured in the Daily Mail article.

695
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,360
That basically says, leave me out of this.

696
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,000
That was when I had members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asking me to have some

697
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,360
and to message one of them that I was still in contact with, seeing if he could tell anything

698
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,320
anonymously to them, which they already know who he is.

699
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,000
I've already provided everybody the names to these guys among the Pentagon Arrow.

700
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
They all have that.

701
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,720
Do you know if they've been contacted by Senate Intelligence Committee or any of these?

702
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,960
Not that I'm aware, because I'm pretty sure I would have gotten probably yelled at or

703
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,160
fuck you or something.

704
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,880
So you guys get picked up by the CH-53 Superstarion, returned to the USS Denver.

705
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,040
How long, what would you say the time elapsed was from the second you were in the Chow Hall

706
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
approached by the major to returning to the ship?

707
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,440
Well, we didn't get approached by the major when there was in the Chow Hall.

708
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,160
It was other Marines, other people.

709
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,080
I don't remember specifically how that happened.

710
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
So who called the volunteers?

711
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,320
She wasn't gathering everybody up.

712
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,720
These were higher up.

713
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,920
It could have been staff sergeants or sergeants or something.

714
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,840
It says, hey, you guys want to come with this?

715
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,840
So whoever was at that point, you're going to meet in the ward room at this time.

716
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,680
And I don't remember the specifics of the time.

717
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,160
I don't remember who told us.

718
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,720
I mean, that's just so long ago.

719
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,760
Yeah, but it's just helpful to kind of understand the context.

720
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,200
It wasn't anybody in my typical chain of command, which was, you know, because obviously

721
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,960
they were kind of more the, hey, you guys are needed for this.

722
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,000
And these were just mission volunteers, not hand selected, like strong operatives or anything

723
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
like that?

724
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
No, they just randomly put us in sticks.

725
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,200
That's all I remember them kind of organizing.

726
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,800
You're in this stick, you guys are in this stick.

727
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,520
So it wasn't like it was something that was very well planned or based off your skill

728
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,120
set or what chain of command or whatever this was.

729
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Yeah.

730
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:16,480
So like, I think we can kind of go chronologically through like your experience in Indonesia.

731
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,480
So like the first thing I'm wondering is like, what, what did the typical day look

732
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,320
like for you on the Denver?

733
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
On the ship?

734
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Yeah.

735
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,240
Like when you were, when you were like en route to Indonesia, like I know you were assigned

736
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,000
to the officer's chow, like what would kind of a typical day look like for you just like

737
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,480
on the ship?

738
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,400
So typically, if I can recall this accurately, I mean, because every day blends together in

739
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
this.

740
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Yeah.

741
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Plus it was like 15 years ago at this point.

742
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,400
So I mean, you typically go to have Reveley, everybody would get up, but obviously we'd

743
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,800
get up early because we were either helping with breakfast and having to serve up that

744
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,480
and at least, you know, which there's, it's not like we were just serving food because

745
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
we didn't do that.

746
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,960
We were just more, I think, trying to set stuff up, try to clean stuffs, you know.

747
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,480
So the cooks actually took actual good care of their job because they're working for the

748
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,280
officers, which is great.

749
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,560
So they want to take pride in what they do.

750
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,280
We got to eat really good because of it compared to what the other guys got to eat.

751
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,360
So that was always good.

752
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
So breakfast...

753
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,920
It's kind of like a full-time job, like that assignment was, was kind of like, you would

754
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,360
report for doing officer's chow and it was like an eight-hour shift type of thing?

755
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Yeah.

756
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Or was it okay?

757
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,800
Sometimes they'd cut you like with a break so you could either go, which I went to the

758
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,480
gym on ship or I went back and then slept for a bit or whatever it is.

759
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,120
So there's always things that you can do because when they task you to work on to that, that's

760
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,400
where you're spending your time.

761
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,320
So how does it work with, you know, especially for me because like I don't have any, you

762
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,240
know, military experience, you know, you have like a chain of command that you're a part

763
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,660
of, you know, as a Marine.

764
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,440
But I know there's, you know, when you're on the ship, you've described kind of like,

765
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,160
it's like a separate chain of command or like...

766
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Correct.

767
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,880
Because what, who you're reporting to are like the Marines that are in charge of that

768
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,720
part of the Marines that are on the ship with logistics.

769
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,840
All they basically did was say, hey, your number's been picked, you're going to go over

770
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,600
here while you're on ship, which is great.

771
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Yeah.

772
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,960
Because like I said, we got to have fun doing it.

773
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,800
We got to eat better than everybody else, you know, so it was something that I enjoyed

774
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,720
doing because I got to eat tuna all the time, I got peanut butter, I got all the good stuff.

775
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
We got T-bone steaks.

776
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,760
Everybody else got the little tiny cuts and we got full T-bones.

777
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Yeah.

778
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,600
So you would work in child with people that weren't necessarily in your immediate team

779
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,040
or platoon, just random people on the ship whose numbers were called for same duty.

780
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Correct.

781
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,480
I mean, it wasn't really a number basis.

782
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,920
They just selected whoever, whatever amount they needed, they've all been told us to,

783
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,080
you know, this is what you're going to do.

784
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,160
And typically during that, I do remember deploying, at least being forward-deployed

785
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,040
to Japan a couple weeks to, I think, a month before the whole main element did because

786
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,040
they got us ready and we went on ship before everybody else did too, because we're obviously

787
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,200
working this detail.

788
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,040
So they have to kind of read you up on things, show you how to do things, and then when the

789
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,520
whole thing kicks off, get on ship and everybody's just, you know, so for weeks we were on ship

790
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,200
with nobody else in our boarding, which was cool too.

791
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,120
So they were trying to figure out where Marines were being assigned to, if that makes sense.

792
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:33,320
Now, so when you got, you know, you spoke about getting briefed in the ward room, that

793
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,880
was where you were assigned.

794
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
So how did that exactly go down?

795
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Like were you like in the middle of, you know, working in the kitchen and then you just heard

796
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,240
someone call out like, you know, hey, we need some volunteers, was it?

797
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
I think it was that.

798
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,560
I don't remember that part specifically.

799
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,840
I just remember the key things.

800
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,440
I remember who briefed us, which was a female major, and then they were putting up pictures

801
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,400
of Obama when he was a kid, saying there was family members were there.

802
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,520
So the things that really stuck out of place, I kind of, what I remember mostly.

803
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,840
Now did you, you had actually brought this up earlier.

804
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,000
Had you ever seen that woman before?

805
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No.

806
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,280
Like was she dressed in navy, do you soft blue?

807
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,520
She was in, she was in our Mar-Pat Woodlands.

808
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Okay.

809
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
So USMC.

810
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
Okay.

811
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,400
So were there other people who were kind of brought to volunteer with you?

812
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,720
Were they in the mess hall with you when the major comes in and is requesting volunteers?

813
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,680
Yes, some of them, not all of them, but some of them.

814
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,200
And so at this time, like your immediate squad, team leader, the other people you're with,

815
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,680
they're doing other duties on the ship.

816
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,680
They're doing whatever the unit's doing, typically.

817
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,840
So that's how that works.

818
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,000
Now we weren't in a combat situation.

819
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,800
So that's why that it was a little bit different because it's more relaxed.

820
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,320
Now if this was something that was combat oriented, then they really wouldn't pull us

821
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,240
off to do anything like this because we'd be training and doing whatever we had to do

822
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
with our unit.

823
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
Right.

824
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,800
Because I know there's a lot of questions about like team leaders and so forth.

825
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,000
So when you're on an active mission with a team leader, you'd be with them like glue,

826
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,520
but on ships, you're assigned to your actual duties and so forth.

827
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,520
Correct.

828
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,880
And it also kind of depends on what details you're doing, obviously.

829
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,040
So I mean, it's not like that for everybody.

830
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,280
There's people, yeah, you have an acting team leader who's just a guy who fills that billet.

831
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,120
He could be somebody else that's not, in our instance, was not in our platoon or squad

832
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
or anything like that.

833
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,560
So what kind of typical check-in would you have to do with any superior while on the

834
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,560
ship?

835
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,800
So when we would report to that, they'd obviously kind of take roll call, make sure everybody

836
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,120
was there and then that's pretty much it.

837
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,240
It wasn't, I mean, because really it's not like rocket science, for example.

838
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,160
So you know, but it was, you also reported to Navy personnel too because they're the

839
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,080
ones that you're typically helping and assisting.

840
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
They're part of the ship.

841
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Correct.

842
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,840
So they have more kind of what you would call a higher billet at that point because it's

843
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
their ship.

844
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
Yeah.

845
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,200
That makes a lot of sense because that's really helpful just from someone who's not military

846
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,840
that provides a lot of context.

847
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:08,120
Now so during the actual briefing that you were given about the mission that you were

848
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:15,080
about to partake on, were there other people in the ward room during that briefing or was

849
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,680
it, so like there could potentially be bystanders that kind of overheard the mission briefing

850
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
essentially.

851
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,960
So anybody who was in there were some key leaders, but there was also some other NCOs.

852
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,880
There were a lot of people I didn't know.

853
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,360
So I'm just thinking there could potentially be witnesses that would have seen you, seen

854
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
the briefing.

855
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,360
If they remember.

856
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,360
Yeah.

857
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,360
I mean, right.

858
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,160
You know, I mean, like I said, I don't remember anybody else besides some of the guys, but

859
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,920
I just remember the thing that stuck out was a female major because she was beautiful.

860
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Yeah.

861
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,480
Somebody that's, you know, of course you're on ship.

862
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,000
You're like, man, I see a lot of women around.

863
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,360
So there was that.

864
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,440
And then obviously the whole thing with Obama, you really don't see anything like that.

865
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,080
It's not something you're really briefed on most of the time.

866
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,480
So I wanted to show this to you.

867
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
Does this look like what that word would look like?

868
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,920
I was trying to find a picture of like the actual Denver.

869
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Yeah.

870
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,920
That would.

871
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,880
That is a different ship, but it's the same, you know, the same class.

872
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
Yeah.

873
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,680
And from what I can recall, because they had a wall where the projector was hitting and

874
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,680
that's where they were given.

875
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,360
But that's kind of similar, at least from this view.

876
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
Yeah.

877
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,520
I mean, but then again, it looks a lot like other ward rooms that were on other ships

878
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
that I've been on.

879
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,280
Well, just to get a general idea of the size, like for me thinking like half a tier, because

880
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,000
a ward room is essentially a cafeteria.

881
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah.

882
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's just like a fancy.

883
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Smaller because obviously, yeah, correct.

884
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah.

885
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,480
So it's kind of a more small, intimate kind of setting.

886
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
Correct.

887
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,880
What else can you remember from this briefing?

888
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,400
What was the mission operation directive?

889
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,120
What was the mission time?

890
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,480
I don't remember any of those fine details.

891
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,120
Just because one, it's been a long time.

892
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:09,480
But two, the only things I can recall is literally the female major briefing us and then pictures

893
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,600
of Obama when he was a kid, his parents, just stuff that really stuck out.

894
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
Yeah.

895
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,160
And I actually found evidence of Obama.

896
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,720
He spent a lot of time in Indonesia when he was a child and that's all public knowledge.

897
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,160
So it's interesting that they had included that.

898
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,840
But I mean, just overall, like in general, what was your understanding of like what you

899
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,920
guys were about to go security security security.

900
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Yeah.

901
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,440
But I think it was there was there was a delivery of supplies, you can go to it to a remote

902
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
village.

903
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,240
You know, there's plenty of evidence that that says that the right helicopter, the heavy

904
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,800
lift helicopters, the super stallions on the Denver were specifically going to be tasked

905
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,040
to go to remote villages because roads were being blocked off by by landslides and stuff.

906
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,200
And so you're saying security for the elderly.

907
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,200
Yeah.

908
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,200
Yeah.

909
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,320
The whole point in this isn't something that just even what that female major was saying,

910
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,800
but it's just even the fact that everybody knows that this is the second largest terrorist

911
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,800
capital in the world.

912
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,880
And very, it's a very Muslim dominant area.

913
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,880
You know what I mean?

914
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,400
So there's people that typically aren't going to be very friendly of us.

915
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,120
And that's kind of the first concerns they were having.

916
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,560
Why they did things the way they did.

917
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
I don't know.

918
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,560
I didn't plan it.

919
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,960
I wasn't in charge with that.

920
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,520
So there's things that even I have questions or it's like, why would you do that?

921
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Yeah.

922
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,480
And what was the protocol after the briefing where you immediately ordered to go to a armory

923
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,040
locker, check out weapons and ammunition and report to the super stallions?

924
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,320
So all they told us to do was basically get.

925
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,800
So they got all her stuff and we went to the armory to draw what and they already had weapons

926
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,320
picked for us because that was a sawgunner.

927
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,720
So we don't, they didn't, we're not using a saw for this type of ordeal, you know, because

928
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,920
it's not, you're not going into combat.

929
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,520
So that's how I remember because I was a sawgunner.

930
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,880
I never really was issued an M16.

931
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,840
First time I, when I got there, I was actually issued a 203 with an M16A4 and that was with

932
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,480
Gulf company.

933
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,080
And they said that the reason why they wanted me to do that was because I was the boot and

934
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,480
they're looking for the people with the grenade launcher because they know it's a team leader.

935
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,520
So meaning that the enemy's going to target you.

936
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,600
So which, I mean, it was, it was cool because I'm like, I get to carry a grenade launcher,

937
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,480
but then I liked the saw because it's a belt-fed automatic weapon and I like that better.

938
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,480
And so naturally being used to them 16, it's stuck because I like having a machine gun.

939
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
Yeah.

940
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
Full auto.

941
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
Yeah.

942
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
And I eat.

943
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,960
So, you know, the whole idea of you providing security, you know, and initially a lot of

944
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,360
people would say like, oh, that's baloney, like no one would have weapons on a humanitarian

945
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,360
mission.

946
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,800
Because really the overall operation was humanitarian relief, deliverance, supplies, and people

947
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,720
like, oh, you would never have weapons.

948
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:07,960
But I found Rear Admiral Richard Landolt, who's the Rear Admiral who debriefed you after

949
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,320
your mission on the ship.

950
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,960
He actually did a sort of like a press conference briefing and I'll just read a part of the

951
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,240
quote here.

952
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,760
So once the 53s came aboard on the morning of the 9th of October, we put them to work

953
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,520
first getting survey teams out to the countryside to see where it would be the best locations

954
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,600
to drop the cargo that we want to get there and also to get people in place because when

955
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,440
these helicopters start showing up with cargo, the first concern is crowd control, you know,

956
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,880
so you don't want people, you know, rushing the helicopters and another little interesting

957
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,280
thing that kind of supports this that I found was photographs from the 9th and the 10th

958
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:59,680
of the Indonesian military because there was also Indonesian military doing relief as well.

959
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,000
And there's a picture of the helicopter in a whole bunch of locals just like all over

960
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,960
the helicopter, just like mobbing it.

961
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,160
Totally makes sense that there would be a mission like that to provide security and

962
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,880
not to mention we've, you know, at this point, have found numerous photographs of people,

963
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,400
of Marines doing exactly that.

964
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,480
They had rifles and were, you know, providing security around the helicopters.

965
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,480
Right.

966
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Well, I mean, security is needed.

967
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,520
It's just common sense at that point, you know, as much as people would say in the military

968
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,840
or at least in the Marine Corps, common sense is not common virtue, but you still got to

969
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,960
protect and have a barrier between everybody else because second largest terrorist capital

970
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
in the world.

971
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,440
There's also desperate people who are desperate to do anything for help.

972
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,240
And you have that combination of things that can get pretty tricky.

973
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,160
Thankfully, we didn't have that, but thankfully, I would have rather have experienced that

974
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,080
compared to what we did experience.

975
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,080
Right.

976
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,080
Yeah, so.

977
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,520
Now, do you remember, do you remember which day you did your mission?

978
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,640
I don't recall specifically the day.

979
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,960
That's kind of what I'm having trouble with.

980
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,080
I don't know if it was the ninth or the 10th.

981
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,640
So the ship arrived.

982
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,840
So there's a little bit of discrepancy on the exact date and I think it comes down to

983
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,400
the time zone of like whatever press organization reported it.

984
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,520
But like, for instance, right in this testimony from, from the rear admiral, you know, he

985
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,600
says the ninth.

986
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,400
So it seems like it was like early morning on the ninth or like late at night on the

987
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
eighth.

988
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,080
So was it like, do you remember it being the very first day that the ship arrived?

989
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,320
Oh, so, I mean, we never really went topside.

990
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,560
So I don't, you know, we're in the kitchen or in the wardrobe or anything like that working.

991
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,840
So I don't remember specifically where the only thing I remember is them turning the

992
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,400
phones off because they had these phone banks that you have on ship and they turn it off

993
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,520
for about a couple of weeks.

994
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,480
And because I was going to call my dad and be like, Hey, we're here, you know, but they

995
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,000
didn't want that.

996
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,560
So I don't remember specifically the day.

997
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:12,800
I do remember that when we were on foot that it was had to have been somewhere in the early

998
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,920
afternoon or probably late morning, that timeframe, I'm not entirely sure.

999
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,120
I can't recall that.

1000
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,240
I wish I could because then I can kind of pinpoint where things may have, we can coordinate

1001
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,240
it somehow.

1002
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,400
What, at what point did you realize that you weren't going to have radios?

1003
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,480
I wasn't a radio guy.

1004
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,920
So that wasn't, that wasn't my thing.

1005
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,920
So like wasn't even on your radar to like think, Oh, Oh, do we have radios?

1006
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,920
Yeah.

1007
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Cause I'm not used to that.

1008
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,720
I mean, they trained us on the radios, but it wasn't something that we ever really had.

1009
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,880
I mean, I wasn't a team leader, a squad leader at that point, you know, so I didn't have

1010
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
access to that.

1011
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
And that wasn't a concern.

1012
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,480
My concern was just what I was dealing with.

1013
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,600
So I don't remember radios, you know, and the fact is, is I don't remember seeing anybody

1014
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
have radios.

1015
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,520
And the thing is, is it's a humanitarian mission.

1016
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,080
It's not a combat operation.

1017
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,880
You know, so it's not like you're stepping out, expecting you get into firefights and

1018
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
things like that.

1019
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,880
Yeah.

1020
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,880
Just humanitarian.

1021
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,480
So when you guys were gearing up for the mission, you just thought whoever they designated

1022
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,200
kind of squad or team leader for this operation, they would have something like that, correct.

1023
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,160
And I think there's been a lot of confusion about these points.

1024
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,560
So this mission happened during one of your designated shifts in the chow hall with a

1025
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,000
team that was not your designated team leader.

1026
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay.

1027
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Correct.

1028
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,400
You know, the acting as a team leader, you know, so which happens, you know, in situations

1029
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,360
like this, at least this is my experience.

1030
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,320
I can't speak for everybody else, but just with what I personally dealt with, this is

1031
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,560
how it went for us.

1032
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:46,840
Now going back to the rifles, you know, like I said, at this point, I found so much evidence

1033
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,720
that there were definitely Marines there with rifles.

1034
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:55,160
However, there were a lot of photographs of guys basically just providing labor, you know,

1035
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,080
moving boxes, loading helicopters, things like that.

1036
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,160
And one thing that was interesting that I learned from multiple platoon members that

1037
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:11,800
I had reached out to and spoke to, they told me that there was like this rumor that some

1038
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,640
of the first Marines that flew in had rifles and they got like chewed out by like an Air

1039
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,440
Force Colonel and were told to like go back to the ship because it was like bad optics.

1040
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,920
I'm curious, did you ever hear that rumor?

1041
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,160
I don't remember ever seeing an Air Force Colonel.

1042
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Yeah.

1043
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,080
I remember seeing Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, which everybody knows about that.

1044
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,460
So but as far as an Air Force Colonel, I don't, I don't understand how an Air Force

1045
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,760
Colonel would have jurisdiction over that kind of operation anyway.

1046
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,760
Yeah.

1047
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,480
He wouldn't be in a role to tell Marines that they have to go back to a ship.

1048
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
That's somebody else.

1049
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
Yeah.

1050
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,120
I found that, I found that odd as well, but I, you know, I didn't know, you know, not,

1051
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,120
not knowing anything about it.

1052
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:57,520
I didn't understand a Navy Fullbird Captain or a Marine Colonel for that matter.

1053
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,440
He would have the authority to say something like that because what you're talking about

1054
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,920
is the money and the resources to get X amount of people from ship to shore.

1055
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,800
So it's going to just, it's going to cost money.

1056
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,520
It's just going to not make sense at that point.

1057
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,320
So you got on the helicopter and you flew to Tobbing Airport, which it's not named

1058
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,320
that anymore, but you said that you never got off the helicopter at the airport.

1059
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,160
It was basically just, you know,

1060
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,320
we landed and that's what I remember too.

1061
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,640
And this is kind of what I was able to provide people because we'd never gone off.

1062
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
Right.

1063
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,400
And I can know that basically the direction of when we were flying off the ship that

1064
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,040
they could see the ocean and they can start to see the land.

1065
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,920
So it kind of tells you somewhat the direction of where you're heading.

1066
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,080
All I remember from the airport that we landed on was that there was blue roofs.

1067
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,080
Yeah.

1068
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,800
That's the only thing I can indicate out of that.

1069
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,960
What I'm getting at is it's, it's perfectly plausible.

1070
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,800
If you guys, you know, didn't get off the helicopters, it's perfectly plausible.

1071
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,960
You could have landed there and not caused any sort of stir by walking around with rifles

1072
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,880
because you didn't get out, get off the helicopter.

1073
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,280
Yeah, we weren't, we didn't.

1074
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,800
So because I remember that too, because we were sleeping on a helicopter because that's

1075
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
what you do.

1076
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,280
You know, you get used to in transport everywhere.

1077
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,240
We did in seven tons of AVs, helicopters, all that fun stuff.

1078
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,160
So you're just like, I'm just getting a ride and you can fall asleep anywhere at this point.

1079
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,240
So and it's boring, you know, it's not like it's anything.

1080
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,240
So it's just humanitarian.

1081
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,960
You know, we're hoping at that point that there would have been something, but not in

1082
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,280
the indication of what we experienced, but you know, something outside of that.

1083
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,120
So when we, because what I do remember vaguely is when we landed on the airstrip and I remember

1084
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,360
seeing other helicopters basically trailing behind us and land.

1085
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,880
And then we were sitting there.

1086
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,200
I don't remember the time or how long we were sitting there, but I remember then us taking

1087
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
off.

1088
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,160
It's 53.

1089
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,160
Okay.

1090
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,600
There may have been some 46 is two.

1091
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,880
I'm not entirely sure, but I only remember the Denver and I only remember being on a

1092
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,880
CH 53.

1093
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,760
I don't remember any kind of other helicopters that were on that deck.

1094
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,760
Yeah.

1095
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,000
I never really spent much time topside.

1096
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,080
The only reason I bring that up is it's, I'm wondering if those were the same helicopters

1097
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,840
that ended up following you guys to the LZ, you know, because I know you had said that

1098
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:22,440
there were other helicopters because they're, that could be plausible as far as I know.

1099
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,400
The Super Stallions were only the ones that came on the Denver.

1100
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,040
Like there weren't any additional Super.

1101
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
Yeah.

1102
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,480
I don't, I don't remember, you know, I don't remember any of that.

1103
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,480
Right.

1104
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,840
I mean, there's been plenty of ships that have been on where I remember seeing 46s, which

1105
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,840
are the dual, the egg beaters, if you will.

1106
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,960
I remember seeing plenty of those, you know, but as far as the Denver, I don't really recall

1107
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,960
that.

1108
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,080
And I could have not been.

1109
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
Yeah.

1110
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
I just don't know.

1111
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:54,680
Even if your mission happened after the point where those guys supposedly got yelled at

1112
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,800
for bringing rifles, like it's plausible that you could have had your mission even after

1113
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:04,160
that point and just slip by on notice because you didn't get off the helicopter, you know.

1114
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:12,680
So the flight to the LZ described the view that you have outside the back of the helicopter.

1115
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,600
So coming from the airport, I can remember just looking at the ocean and then we were

1116
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:25,800
getting, I remember seeing some very heavy vegetation and kind of like hills, wasn't

1117
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,320
like flat with trees or bushes or anything.

1118
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,680
It was like getting thicker and was, I remember seeing some hills, not from the helicopter,

1119
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,400
but because when you get off the bird, they have one area where you can't go because you

1120
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,280
have this big tail rotor and you don't want to run underneath the thing.

1121
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,960
So they always say either I think is go to the right or the left, I can't remember.

1122
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,880
But whatever the, whatever side that tail rotor is not on is where you're egressing

1123
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,880
the helicopter.

1124
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,600
And then basically you would form a 360 around the helicopter to provide that security and

1125
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,080
then it'd take off.

1126
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,760
And then you basically would get into formation and you'd patrol out from there.

1127
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,480
I don't really recall when I got off the helicopter what I really saw at that point.

1128
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,440
I do remember seeing some hills and remember seeing some big, thick vegetation.

1129
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,720
I don't remember if I saw any villagers or other personnel or people there.

1130
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,800
Backing up just a step, like when you guys were at the airport, were there any supplies

1131
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,440
loaded on the helicopter?

1132
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,080
So this was strictly a personnel transport and were there any other people on the helicopter

1133
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,600
that were being taken to the LZ or was it just us?

1134
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,600
It was just us.

1135
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:39,400
And then you have the crew chief and you have some other crew support and then the pilots

1136
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
obviously.

1137
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,760
I don't really, I only recall one crew chief who's just basically walking up and down watching

1138
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,920
everybody doing their job.

1139
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,400
I don't remember anybody else.

1140
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:55,040
I just remember just one guy and I don't remember seeing any kind of boxes or stuff

1141
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
that they would store in there.

1142
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,800
And obviously we didn't have anything on the bottom because how are you going to land at

1143
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,600
the airport when you have something underneath?

1144
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Yeah.

1145
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,680
Like a cargo hook type of thing, which some of the helicopters were transporting stuff

1146
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
that way.

1147
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:12,400
You landed at the LZ, you describe it as a hasty LZ.

1148
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,400
Yeah.

1149
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Now, I've come to learn that's like a technical term, that means something very specific.

1150
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,600
Are you using it in that way or what does that mean for someone who doesn't know?

1151
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,720
Hasty is kind of like off the hip.

1152
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,520
It's not something very thought out.

1153
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,760
It's just like, okay, where can we, okay, right there looks good.

1154
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
Right?

1155
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,640
And that's maybe what they were thinking as far as the pilots are concerned.

1156
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,760
I don't know, but maybe they had it designated, but it just seemed to me because we were kind

1157
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,360
of the first ones there that it'd be hasty in my opinion.

1158
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,720
But then when everything else is set up, some other Marines that probably come in were like,

1159
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
okay, this is secured.

1160
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
It's something set up.

1161
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,200
It may not be a hasty LZ at that point.

1162
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,080
But when we approached it, I just remember not really seeing anybody there.

1163
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,320
So it's kind of like, okay, we'll.

1164
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,480
So there was no, so there weren't, there wasn't anyone at the LZ when you landed?

1165
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Yeah.

1166
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,840
I don't recall that.

1167
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,640
There could have been some bystanders off to the, off in the distance that maybe saw

1168
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,840
the attention or saw what was going on that decided to come up at a later point.

1169
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,720
But yeah, as far as arriving there, I don't remember seeing anybody.

1170
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,080
So you guys step off the CH-53, your primary objective is to provide security.

1171
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,640
What do you guys do right when you step off the helicopter?

1172
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,040
Well, we saw this opportunity to take the slope because we have visual around everything.

1173
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,080
It allows us to basically act within that protocol, right?

1174
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,880
As being in a tactical advantage of being in an elevated position is where you want

1175
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,880
to be.

1176
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,160
And that's what, you know, that wasn't the one that made the decision.

1177
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,360
The guy that was in charge of us was the one that made that decision.

1178
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:44,440
You know, it wasn't terribly too far in comparison, but at the same point, when you have visual

1179
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:50,880
of that and you're also watching some other stuff happen, I remember really seeing one

1180
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,080
helicopter that actually had the cargo net on the bottom that was flown in, dropped it

1181
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,520
off and then it banked off to the right.

1182
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:04,640
What I'm curious is like, what was your initial impression when you got off the helicopter,

1183
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:11,760
like in comparison to your briefing, like your expectations that were set by the briefing,

1184
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,600
and then the reality of you getting off this helicopter and you're there, first of all,

1185
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,320
you said the helicopter left, right?

1186
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,600
Like it dropped you guys off, it's gone.

1187
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,720
You guys have no radio, there's really no one around.

1188
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,760
You guys are the only people there.

1189
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:35,760
So like, can you remember, like, was there an adjustment to your expectations of like

1190
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,680
the reality of the situation versus what you were expecting?

1191
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,200
Honestly, I thought it was more like, hey, we're not doing shit with this.

1192
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
Yeah.

1193
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,840
It's like it's just going to be boring to standing around looking at people like, you

1194
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,520
know, and that's why I had a video camera when I was taking pictures and video because

1195
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,200
I remember getting the one helicopter that dropped off something on video and I remember

1196
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:59,320
getting it and needless to say, it wasn't at the point where we, you know, because we

1197
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,040
were conditioned three with our weapons.

1198
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,320
It wasn't like it was chambered around or nothing.

1199
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:08,920
We just had a magazine inserted, safety was on, the bolt was all the way forward, weapon

1200
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,560
was on safe and the ejection port cover was closed as it states in the condition rules,

1201
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,640
right?

1202
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,720
So I thought it was just, oh yeah, we're just going to be standing around.

1203
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,520
This is just going to be kind of boring, you know, even trying to help out with boxes or

1204
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,280
something probably would have been more helpful in comparison here because you're actually

1205
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
doing something.

1206
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Yeah.

1207
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
Right.

1208
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
So, you know.

1209
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
That lines up perfect.

1210
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,560
Like every single person I've talked to who was on this operation, you know, doing different

1211
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:39,960
missions on the operation described the same situation where they felt it was like boring.

1212
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,200
It was like an excuse to get off the ship.

1213
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,520
You know, obviously you're doing a good deed and you, and you know, it's, it's a good experience

1214
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:51,320
from that perspective, but it's interesting to hear that because I think a lot of people

1215
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,160
have this misconception that this was like, you know, because you had mentioned that,

1216
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,400
oh, you know, you were notified there were terrorists in the, in the location that you

1217
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,320
guys were like super on alert.

1218
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:06,920
Like this was like, you were ready to engage an enemy and, and you know, that sort of thing.

1219
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
Nothing like that.

1220
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,320
Were you surprised when the helicopter took off?

1221
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,320
Yeah.

1222
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,320
Okay.

1223
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,280
And did you have any sort of estimated timeframe when it was to return or the mission duration?

1224
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,000
I have no clue about that.

1225
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,080
You guys are, I suppose the squad leader decided that you guys should go up to the top of the

1226
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,080
hill, right?

1227
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:30,080
And you know what, it makes sense because we were out in the open and you don't necessarily

1228
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,600
want to be out in the open if you've got no support at that end.

1229
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,080
So where we were at was kind of hidden and you kind of get in the vegetation a little

1230
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,080
bit more.

1231
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,440
So I can kind of understand why he would say, let's go ahead and push up this direction.

1232
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,800
Now you've mentioned a second helicopter flying in.

1233
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,480
You had your camera, you know, you, you took some pictures of that helicopter coming in.

1234
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,240
But did you, I almost remember you saying that it, it didn't fly to the same landing

1235
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,760
point that your helicopter did.

1236
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,760
It landed somewhere.

1237
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,760
Off in the distance.

1238
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,760
Yeah.

1239
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,760
A little bit further away.

1240
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,760
So that makes me wonder kind of how big was the LZ essentially?

1241
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Like was it was kind of just like an open area?

1242
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,880
Was it just like a, no, no, it was, it was pretty open.

1243
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,200
I remember it kind of being open, but that's where I remember the hills and stuff because

1244
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,680
there was like an open area with thick, tall grass, right?

1245
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,840
And it was kind of, I would assume muddy because it's a tropical terrain, obviously.

1246
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,440
It wasn't like we were on a dirt road or something that was already, you know, cleared

1247
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,120
out to be used as transportation.

1248
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,960
So I think it was just more in a sense that there's a clear area over here.

1249
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,240
And obviously there was, they probably, the second helicopter probably saw other people

1250
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,760
that were probably close to that area and assumed that those are the people.

1251
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,080
For us, we were off in the distance.

1252
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,560
So whether or not he could see us at that point, I don't know.

1253
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,920
I assume he wouldn't be able to, but because where we were at, I mean, there's trees, you

1254
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
know.

1255
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,920
Yeah.

1256
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,120
So you didn't see any sort of like preparation to the LZ, like they didn't cut down trees

1257
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,120
ahead of time.

1258
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,120
You didn't see any red tape.

1259
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:05,920
Cause I've seen some photographs of other LZs that showed like red tape kind of closing

1260
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
off the area.

1261
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,920
Yeah.

1262
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,680
I don't remember any red tape or seeing that kind of stuff.

1263
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,680
So.

1264
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,680
Right.

1265
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,000
So what the time elapsed was from the second you left the chow hall to returning to the

1266
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Denver.

1267
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I had it been a couple hours.

1268
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Okay.

1269
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Had it been a couple hours.

1270
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
But not like a full day.

1271
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No, it was not a full day.

1272
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It had to have been a couple hours.

1273
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It was nothing.

1274
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,400
Something that could have taken place within the span of a chow hall shift.

1275
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,400
Like the time you'd spend working.

1276
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Probably more than that too.

1277
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
Okay.

1278
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,120
You know, because it had to be a couple hours, man, you know, it wasn't, wasn't like an all

1279
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,120
day thing.

1280
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,120
Okay.

1281
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,120
Thankfully.

1282
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,400
You know what I forgot to ask is the, what was the weather like at the LZ?

1283
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,920
Sunny.

1284
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
Yeah.

1285
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,920
Yep.

1286
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,920
Sunny.

1287
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,920
I remember, I remember because it was hot.

1288
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,920
I mean, it was hot.

1289
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,040
Regardless of, I guess, if there, even if there was cloud cover, it still would be hot because

1290
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,400
it's tropical.

1291
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:59,840
I don't remember really, I don't remember actually looking up at the sky to see if there were

1292
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,240
clouds or if it was sunny.

1293
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:06,320
I just remember it being hot, assuming it was sunny.

1294
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,400
And so when you get back to the Denver, how does it work?

1295
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,840
Like, you know, you have your rifle, you have to like go back to the armory or something.

1296
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,560
We dropped everything off there, given the magazines.

1297
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,560
Wasn't my magazines.

1298
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,560
It was somebody else's.

1299
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,560
What do you mean by that?

1300
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,560
Well, there's the armor that gave us those magazines that were full.

1301
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,560
Because you were saw.

1302
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,920
So you had your own weapon assigned.

1303
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,920
Yep.

1304
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:32,240
I had my own magazines, but actually remember if I actually had those on my vest too, or

1305
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:38,480
if I were to left them locked up or in a typically had those in my assault pack, which I didn't

1306
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:46,720
bring an assault pack with me, trying to think, remember, yeah, it was somebody else's magazines,

1307
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
for sure.

1308
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
So it wasn't mine.

1309
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,400
Because this was a loner M16, loner magazines from assigned to a different soldier.

1310
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:59,440
People compare you to like the like the Dodie and Benowitz story, and I'm like, that's completely

1311
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:06,160
different because Benowitz didn't have this like a undeniable experience where he saw

1312
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,160
an anti-radio.

1313
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,160
Correct.

1314
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,800
Yeah, radio communications and he speculated that it could be ET and Dodie just egged

1315
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
that on.

1316
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
Correct.

1317
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
Yeah.

1318
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,800
This is totally different.

1319
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,800
And this is coming from Dodie himself.

1320
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,800
I asked him kind of what that whole thing was.

1321
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
Yeah.

1322
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,240
He said, yeah, well, somebody said they heard something, Paul, and this is what I was told

1323
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,240
to do.

1324
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,240
Right.

1325
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,240
That's what he said.

1326
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,120
So I mean, like it makes, it just logically makes no sense.

1327
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:36,280
Like if you were making this up, if a disinfo agent were to come and like, be like, yeah,

1328
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,160
I know about your operation that you stumbled upon.

1329
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,160
Yeah.

1330
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,400
It's like, if you made it up, you would know that he's lying.

1331
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
Well, exactly.

1332
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,080
Because how could he tell you that he knows about operations and stuff if it was made

1333
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,080
up?

1334
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,600
Like it just doesn't make any sense.

1335
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
No.

1336
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,800
I mean, I wish it was made up because then I wouldn't have to have been going through

1337
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:59,440
losing my fucking hair and having the, you know, sleepless nights and literally just,

1338
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,280
I wouldn't be in the uncomfortable position I would be in.

1339
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,280
Yeah.

1340
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,640
And it's not fun being in this position.

1341
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,640
It really isn't.

1342
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,240
I mean, that's why I tell people, especially, I'm not encouraging my guys to come forward

1343
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,360
and let's say if this thing blows hope and then all of a sudden everything is able to

1344
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:19,760
be proven true, and let's just say these insiders at some point ever do, or some information

1345
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,240
comes out that's physical that literally no shit can prove everything, then maybe they

1346
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,240
would.

1347
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
I don't know.

1348
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
Yeah.

1349
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,240
But it put them in a different position.

1350
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,800
But right now, I mean, even for myself, they know that I'm uncomfortable and they kind

1351
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,640
of like, well, it's your fucking fault.

1352
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,640
I don't blame them.

1353
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,560
I mean, but if I didn't see what I saw and somebody else from a different perspective

1354
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,560
was telling this story, I don't know how I would react to that.

1355
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,920
Probably, I probably wouldn't believe it.

1356
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,800
I'd probably be, but that's the only thing is before any of this happened, I was not

1357
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,840
somebody who believed in this shit.

1358
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,440
I was somebody who was like, okay, well, this guy's out of his fucking mind or, you know,

1359
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,080
well, you got, so you're, let me guess, you're in Mississippi and you're fishing and you

1360
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,160
saw a fucking craft and you saw a fucking graze.

1361
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,400
Okay.

1362
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,920
What episode of X Files are you talking about?

1363
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,400
That's how I would think of it.

1364
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,920
But then having my experience is just like, if I experienced this, okay, maybe there

1365
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,560
might be some validity to what they're saying.

1366
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,560
I don't know.

1367
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,560
I wasn't there, but I know based off of being in my shoes, it's like, it's hard to say somebody

1368
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,520
else is not true or to try to point out the flaws or anything like that.

1369
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,920
I know what it's like to be in somebody's shoes like that.

1370
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,440
Granted, I didn't see ETs.

1371
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,920
I saw operators and I saw it was clearly man-made.

1372
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,560
It was, didn't do shit on a normal helicopter or plane did.

1373
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,560
I can tell you that.

1374
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,560
Right.

1375
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,360
I mean, it's like an unmistakable experience like it's not like something you saw at a

1376
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,360
distance.

1377
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,360
I was like, oh, that looks weird.

1378
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,360
Like this thing's right here.

1379
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,360
Yep.

1380
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,360
You see it.

1381
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
It's huge.

1382
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,360
We're close enough to hear it.

1383
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Yeah.

1384
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,360
You know, right.

1385
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,360
That's kind of the point.

1386
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,360
And you saw it fly off.

1387
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,360
Yep.

1388
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,360
I mean, it's like, didn't have a rotor.

1389
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,360
It wasn't like a helicopter.

1390
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,360
It wasn't a plane.

1391
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,360
Yeah.

1392
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,440
And no rotor wash on the vegetation.

1393
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,440
Nothing.

1394
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,040
It was like it was isolated in itself.

1395
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,000
Like it didn't disturb any of the environment.

1396
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,080
It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

1397
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,680
And I wanted to be a fighter pilot and I knew pretty much what kind of aircraft we had at

1398
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:17,600
our disposal as a Marine Corps and especially the Air Force only has a certain amount of

1399
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,560
planes they're using, helicopters, same thing.

1400
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,400
There's only so many.

1401
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,360
This obviously was an Indonesian military equipment.

1402
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:31,000
I don't remember anybody come and saying, hey, yeah, Indonesian military has something

1403
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,280
that's sophisticated or Chinese or Japanese or for that matter.

1404
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,280
Right.

1405
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,280
You know.

1406
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,280
Yeah.

1407
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,240
I find it interesting to, you know, you testified to Arrow and like I noticed in the historical

1408
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:50,200
report, you know, they emphasize like belief and like, you know, basically trying to say,

1409
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,520
you know, people might believe what they saw or anything, but we can't prove that they're

1410
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,520
lying.

1411
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:02,320
And I'm like, what you're describing is an unmistakable testimony.

1412
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,120
There's no, it's not like you could say like, oh, well, maybe he believes that's what he

1413
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,280
saw, but maybe it was something different.

1414
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,280
I know what I said.

1415
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,360
There's no way it was, you know, some normal thing.

1416
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,520
If anybody was to have seen this, they would remember this for the rest of their lives.

1417
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,200
It's so distinct because this never happens.

1418
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Right.

1419
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,200
It's stumbling.

1420
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,560
I mean, in some ways people think, oh, it's stumbling on the goal.

1421
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,560
No, it's really not.

1422
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,520
But in some cases of saying that, yes, we have this technology because there's human involvement,

1423
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,520
obviously.

1424
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,720
It's not like there's an ETs and they're floating, flying in this damn thing.

1425
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,000
And there's just operators who just choose to be there.

1426
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,840
I mean, it's completely manmade.

1427
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,320
And with the human involvement just tells me, okay, well, manmade human involvement means

1428
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,560
it's some group has it.

1429
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,820
Now I know who it is to an extent.

1430
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,600
And speaking of Aero, I really wanted to kind of fast forward to when you talked to him

1431
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,320
in April of 2023.

1432
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,320
What was that like?

1433
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,000
Well, like an interrogation to an extent.

1434
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,280
And so you spoke directly to Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, right?

1435
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,120
He's the only one that I can confirm that yes, I talked to.

1436
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:15,240
I know the other gentleman, but what I signed stating that I was not allowed to divulge

1437
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,920
where we met at or who was also there.

1438
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,120
But Dr. Kirkpatrick was in the interview.

1439
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,600
And I think he was in everybody's interview.

1440
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,320
I'll have to ask other whistleblowers.

1441
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,720
I personally know if he was sitting in there with them, but he was there.

1442
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:31,600
What was his demeanor like when you were speaking to him?

1443
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,960
Not really interested.

1444
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,720
Everybody else was taking notes.

1445
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,240
He was more interested in the fact of, because he only asked three questions and the three

1446
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,360
questions were all the same.

1447
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,160
It was who were these operators?

1448
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,800
I already stated once, I don't know.

1449
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,040
I'm not going to know the second time.

1450
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,560
I'm not going to know the third time.

1451
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:55,520
I know a little bit now of what group they're a part of and what their backgrounds may be.

1452
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,880
But I don't know who they directly are.

1453
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,240
And if it was any of the people that I've been talking and working with, I would remember

1454
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,240
who they are based off their faces.

1455
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,920
And none of them are those guys.

1456
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,400
When you testified to him, did Dr. Kirkpatrick say he'd follow up?

1457
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,760
Did he say what was going to happen next?

1458
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,760
Oh, yeah.

1459
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,760
We'll follow up on it.

1460
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,840
Because I had asked them if they could get the satellite imagery of that day and they

1461
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,880
said they had access to that.

1462
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,680
It's been more than a year and they have yet to have anybody contact me from Arrow saying

1463
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,200
that, yes, we have the imagery.

1464
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,520
Where can you point out?

1465
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,520
Because compared to 14, 15 years ago, it's going to look different.

1466
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,800
Maybe they expanded the city.

1467
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,040
There's things that vegetation have grown.

1468
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,880
There's any numerous things that could have happened between at that point to now.

1469
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,360
And how did you feel when the historical report volume one came out that was a complete

1470
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:50,480
misprint lie of your testimony stating you saw an extraterrestrial vehicle?

1471
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,480
Correct.

1472
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,480
I didn't say extraterrestrial.

1473
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,680
And I didn't say there were US special forces.

1474
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,000
None of that came out of my mouth.

1475
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,520
And you got to think that that's a purposeful omission to say those things because that's

1476
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,000
blatantly false.

1477
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Correct.

1478
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,640
I've stated in every single interview and even in the National Press Club and even with

1479
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,480
some gentlemen that I've still in touch with who was in the skiff with me, he for one knows

1480
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,120
I never said anything like that because he was sitting right here when I was talking

1481
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,160
to Kirk Patrick among others.

1482
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:25,320
So I was pretty upset at the fact, but you can't really be upset because you already

1483
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,920
kind of expected them to do something like this and that's just what they do.

1484
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:34,920
Was there, because I think some of the people who testified to Arrow, there was a written

1485
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,880
memorandum for record of their testimony.

1486
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,880
Do you know if there was any written record of what you told them?

1487
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:42,880
I don't remember that either.

1488
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,000
I remember them taking notes and handwriting everything trying to get the details.

1489
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,880
But I think it was something that the witness would sign.

1490
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,400
They would read over it like, okay, yeah, this is what my testimony, they would sign

1491
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,840
it for record to be like, this is my testimony that I provided to Arrow.

1492
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,960
I signed several documents.

1493
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
That could have been one of them.

1494
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,040
I don't recall that.

1495
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:09,000
I remember saying a nondisclosure saying that I would not talk about who specifically

1496
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,880
was there besides Dr. K already admitting that he was in our interviews.

1497
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,200
So that's easy.

1498
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,360
The other gentleman, I can't.

1499
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,600
And then the location, I can't talk about that.

1500
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,080
That's legal binding because it's not anything illegal.

1501
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,520
So I have to respect that.

1502
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,840
What other memorandums have you seen for the Arrow?

1503
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:32,440
Because I've only seen Eric Tabers, who of course is a second hand kind of commenter.

1504
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:41,560
Well, I think there was something that was FOIA release from the Black Vault that I had

1505
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:49,360
recognized was a direct, it was the same exact form that you had shown me.

1506
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
So I had recognized that.

1507
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,160
And that was provided for me to look over before making that trip.

1508
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,560
Prior to, yeah, it wasn't like the actual one you signed, but it was kind of a review.

1509
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,600
Yeah, because there were screenshots of this gentleman's cell phone that he sent me who's

1510
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,600
involved with that.

1511
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,960
Did you watch his interviews with Steven Greenstreet?

1512
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,960
It'll just piss you off.

1513
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,640
I don't watch any of his shit, dude, because I just know it's all bullfucking lies.

1514
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,640
There was supposed to be a second piece that completely got moved.

1515
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,640
You know what would get people's views if they, hey, Sean, go ahead and come on to this

1516
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,640
podcast.

1517
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Here's the whistleblowers.

1518
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,560
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

1519
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,560
Haven't seen you in a while.

1520
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,720
Thanks for being a fucking dick.

1521
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,720
He would never.

1522
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,720
He said he would.

1523
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,840
Guess what?

1524
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,960
I can contradict the shit that he's talking about.

1525
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,960
So can other people.

1526
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:36,120
He said he wouldn't do any more media appearances after getting caught at a 2018 skinlocker ranch

1527
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,120
briefing.

1528
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,120
He's live.

1529
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,880
Well, Brandon actually had posted that.

1530
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,880
Because he did the same thing.

1531
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,280
I didn't talk to him about this.

1532
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,280
I wasn't at this meeting.

1533
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,320
And then Brandon just posted the picture on Twitter.

1534
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,320
I remember I hit Brandon up at that point.

1535
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,320
Yeah.

1536
01:18:52,320 --> 01:19:01,280
What I actually kind of find funny is, so Nathan came forward.

1537
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:08,840
Your team leader claims that you're making this all up.

1538
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:15,360
First of all, it's like, so he was unvetted with Patrick.

1539
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,520
It was framed as if he was in a position.

1540
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:26,080
There's no situation where Nathan would have seen the UFO because from your testimony,

1541
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,560
he wasn't part of your squad that was there.

1542
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,680
So he wouldn't have seen the UFO, right?

1543
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,680
Not at all.

1544
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,680
Yeah.

1545
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:39,240
So for him to be like, yeah, we were on this mission, but we didn't see the UFO doesn't

1546
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,240
make sense.

1547
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,720
Because whatever mission he did, obviously he didn't see the UFO.

1548
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,840
No, and that wasn't on the same one with him.

1549
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,840
Exactly.

1550
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,520
Nor was this a secret night mission.

1551
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,520
No, it was not.

1552
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,560
It was a secret, and it did not involve aliens.

1553
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,840
Not at all.

1554
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,680
I never spoke seeing ETs, guys.

1555
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,640
That's kind of why this is boring in comparison to other people's stuff.

1556
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,880
But no, it was not a night mission.

1557
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,960
That would have sucked if it had been our night.

1558
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,800
We didn't have night vision with us.

1559
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,040
My Kevlar, and I didn't even have a Rhino mount to mount anything because I always kept

1560
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,240
that off because it just get in the way during the daytime.

1561
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:26,480
Quickly I had, on my Kevlar I usually had goggles that were clear lenses.

1562
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,040
Most of the time it was just easy to pop those off and put them on just because, you know,

1563
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,760
I didn't like having darks because they just really fucked with my vision and just, I hated

1564
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,760
it.

1565
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,040
And not only that, but these were ESS and they fogged up like you wouldn't believe.

1566
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,360
At least clears are easier to deal with that as opposed to the dark lenses.

1567
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,520
But yeah, Nathan wasn't with me.

1568
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,440
Yeah, and I mean, so like one thing that I find kind of funny, like when you think about

1569
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,800
it, you know, if, you know, he's saying you made this all up.

1570
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:59,760
And so if that's the case, it means not only did you decide to make up a story about UFOs,

1571
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,840
but you decided the actual mission I went on with Nathan, I'm going to pretend that

1572
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,600
didn't happen too, which makes no sense whatsoever.

1573
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:17,240
And I mean, really the only thing that makes Nathan's testimony have any weight whatsoever

1574
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,920
is simply the fact that you're denying that you were ever on a mission with him because

1575
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,880
you could have very easily have just said, yeah, I did two missions.

1576
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,480
I did one with him and I had this other one.

1577
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,480
Yeah, I didn't do two missions.

1578
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:32,360
So it's like, it's just like anyone with half a brain would like know that, you know, if

1579
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,560
you were making this all up, just say, yeah, I went on this real mission with Nathan.

1580
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,360
Well, yeah, it could easily have said something like that.

1581
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,800
If that was really the case, if I wanted to lie about you, but then obviously the insiders

1582
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,800
wouldn't exist.

1583
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:50,040
And you know, well, that's the biggest thing for me is like, why would this insider be

1584
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,040
approaching?

1585
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,040
And it's just not one guy.

1586
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,040
It's multiple.

1587
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,040
You know what I mean?

1588
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:58,480
So why would they spend any time to try to help me if I was lying to anybody?

1589
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,980
Why would they expose themselves and their parts of it in details that I personally know?

1590
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,800
They wouldn't take that chance.

1591
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,400
They're already, their butts already puckered up just like mine compared because obviously

1592
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:15,320
what they're having to deal with personally, they wouldn't subject themselves to going

1593
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,680
to somebody who's lying.

1594
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,360
It doesn't make any sense.

1595
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:27,040
But so Nathan, the thing that's most compelling about Nathan is, you know, he is who he says

1596
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,040
he is.

1597
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,040
Correct.

1598
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,040
You know, he was your team leader.

1599
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,040
At one point, yes.

1600
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,600
He was on that operation.

1601
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,600
He was on the ship.

1602
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,880
All of that stuff logically lines up.

1603
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,560
And he has this photograph of two people on a helicopter.

1604
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,440
He says one of them is you.

1605
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,440
You've denied that.

1606
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,440
You said it's not you.

1607
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,440
Correct.

1608
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,440
I know who it is.

1609
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,440
I'm not going to say who it is, but I know who it is.

1610
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,440
Yeah.

1611
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:58,800
So the thing, the thing that's interesting though is someone found a match in the camouflage

1612
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,840
between that photo and another photo of you.

1613
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,520
Is it the Daily Mail photo?

1614
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,520
Yeah.

1615
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,520
Yeah.

1616
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,800
Because there's only two photos that I know that have been released.

1617
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,200
One of them was when I sent to Josh Bosworth with Daily Mail because they're like, hey,

1618
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,640
do you have any pictures you want to?

1619
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,640
Yeah.

1620
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,520
I believe it's you helmet on holding the saw.

1621
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,520
Correct.

1622
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,520
So yes.

1623
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,720
And I mean, but here's the thing.

1624
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,160
It's a medium rag that I was wearing.

1625
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,480
A lot of them are the same patterns of that way.

1626
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:29,360
It's not like it's a fingerprint of one specific thing.

1627
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,080
I mean, it's odd that it's in the same location.

1628
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:37,080
Like I know like some of the patterns repeat and that you can find examples of this all

1629
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:42,320
over of finding like the pattern, you know, on a leg here and then on a different uniform.

1630
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,640
Like it'll be on like the other leg or whatever.

1631
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,640
Right.

1632
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,200
And but it's like some of the patterns don't even look identical.

1633
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,200
Just a minor pain.

1634
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,200
Yeah.

1635
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,200
You know, that's just where we're at.

1636
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,560
So you don't think there's any possibility that like it was it was a picture of you on

1637
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,560
a different day?

1638
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,040
No, that was not me.

1639
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,120
It just simply facial structure doesn't look the same as mine.

1640
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,120
Yeah.

1641
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,120
It's not even me.

1642
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,320
I mean, even everybody I've showed that knows me is like, that's not fucking you, dude.

1643
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,320
Yeah.

1644
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,440
People text me like this guy saying it's you.

1645
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,440
That's not you.

1646
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,440
Yeah.

1647
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,840
So I mean, if that's what he's got, that's what he's got.

1648
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
That's not me.

1649
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,720
Right.

1650
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,920
But his intention with this is I don't know, but they're just, I mean, you guys have a

1651
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,920
history.

1652
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,960
I mean, oh, he doesn't like me flat out and the feelings mutual.

1653
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,920
But the thing is I moved, I got with what I'm dealing with in my life and that's all

1654
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,080
I'm focused on.

1655
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,960
I'm not making money off of this stuff.

1656
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,520
This doesn't get me anywhere financially.

1657
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,840
What it does provide is understanding and stuff that I wish I never learned, but the

1658
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,680
truth had to be known and I'm thankful at least these insiders were able to show details

1659
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:50,080
and share me details as well of what they were personally dealing with because these

1660
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,360
guys are working in that organization.

1661
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,360
Yeah.

1662
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:59,640
So let's let's fast forward to that kind of modern day after your whole experience.

1663
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,520
You don't talk about this for many years.

1664
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:09,600
What motivated you to come forward in because you signed an NDA that basically died in your

1665
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,080
life and correct and all of all of us did sign that.

1666
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,680
So what motivated you to come forward?

1667
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,800
What was your objective?

1668
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,360
Well, I just think the truth should have been out.

1669
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:27,000
I don't think that this should be secret and I don't think people should be dying and

1670
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,400
being threatened about ETs or craft or anything.

1671
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,400
It just sounds ridiculous to me.

1672
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:38,920
So my motivation was, you know what, somebody else out there besides the guys I was with

1673
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:46,680
and myself have had to have similar experiences and maybe maybe there's a chance in hell that

1674
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,080
mine connects the dots for something.

1675
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:54,800
Maybe my story can help other people to an extent as crazy as it sounds and don't get

1676
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,800
me wrong.

1677
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,080
I agree that it's absolutely sounds fucking nuts, but they're not in my shoes and I wish

1678
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,720
some people were because it'd be like, you guys would just shut up.

1679
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,720
You guys would stay quiet.

1680
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,760
You guys were like, yeah, that's not cool to talk about.

1681
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:12,120
I don't enjoy talking about it, but that was kind of my, my intention was maybe that this

1682
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:17,560
could help paint a picture or contribute in some way, shape or form.

1683
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,560
Yeah.

1684
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,160
And I think, you know, there was, there were whistleblower protections that had recently

1685
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:29,920
been been passed and I think I remember you talking about that kind of being part of your

1686
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,920
motivation like that.

1687
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,920
Yeah.

1688
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,880
Now that I have a safety net to an extent making the NDA illegal, you know, so obviously

1689
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,160
I haven't had any ramifications of that because it's not like, I mean, I've had harassment,

1690
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,960
but you know, and the harassment service is more of like, okay, well, obviously I'm pissing

1691
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:51,440
the right people off, you know, so if I, again, I have documentation of all the harassment

1692
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,560
that I've talked to with multiple people who know what's going on.

1693
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:59,000
If I was making any of this up, there wouldn't be this harassment, there wouldn't be these

1694
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,520
insiders or wouldn't be this, I wouldn't have a leg to stand on with, with other facts.

1695
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:08,680
Now there are facts in my world that says somebody else observing outside of my circle,

1696
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:13,240
they may say, okay, in their world it may not be facts, but for me in my world it is.

1697
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:19,040
When I first connected with you after my initial Reddit post kind of just researching the military

1698
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:24,880
side of the operation and like realizing that, you know, everything you said to a letter

1699
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:31,400
was accurate regarding the kind of surrounding circumstances and I was like, okay, well what's

1700
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,640
next, you know, and so we, you know, I reached out, we connected.

1701
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:43,120
If I'm honest, I actually grew more skeptical as we started talking because you all of a

1702
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,680
sudden started talking about this insider and I'm like, this is weird, like what are

1703
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,960
the chances that you would have this experience and now all of a sudden someone telling you

1704
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,920
that they know what you saw and they want to meet with you.

1705
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,000
So you know, I didn't have anybody else that I was talking to with this, I don't, I don't

1706
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,080
have a lot of friends, I don't care to have a lot of friends, I got a lot of acquaintances,

1707
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,640
I got a lot of people who know who I am to an extent.

1708
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:10,200
My world is just business and that's what I, you know, I separate this from business

1709
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:15,640
because business is what my livelihood and my employees are, that's what I care about

1710
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,520
as well as the disclosure of wanting the truth to come out.

1711
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,800
So it's not like I had anybody else to say, hey, and then when I saw what you were doing

1712
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,480
and I saw the attention to detail and everything that you were piecing together, that kind

1713
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:32,360
of put something in my mind to say, you know what, maybe this guy can help me out to an

1714
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:37,880
extent, maybe there's things that he could probably pinpoint or, or connect the dots

1715
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:43,160
on and just your attention to detail was just something that's like, you know what, this

1716
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,720
guy's got to ship together.

1717
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,600
Maybe I'm able to provide information to you that, because you seem like you, you're well

1718
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,040
versed in this, I'm not.

1719
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,200
I know what I experienced and there's other things I'm now learning, especially with your

1720
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,640
guys' help, especially pointing out to me things that I can pass on to other people

1721
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,920
and say, yeah, Rene, is this having any legitimacy to it?

1722
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:09,200
So, yeah, I was surprised at the amount of trust that you kind of put into me, right?

1723
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,400
Because like if you had, if you had like told stuff to the wrong person, you could have

1724
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,960
been, but I had a good chance of reading you and kind of gauging you, which is why we had

1725
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,960
a phone call that we initially had.

1726
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:28,400
And the biggest, the, the most craziest, biggest moment for me was, you know, you were talking

1727
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,520
about this insider who wanted to meet with you.

1728
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,840
I was so skeptical.

1729
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,320
It sounded so crazy, but like I had nothing to lose.

1730
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,480
It wasn't like I was this podcaster who like had to report on the story.

1731
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,160
Like I could back away from the whole thing if I, if it fell apart and I felt sketchy

1732
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,160
about it.

1733
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,760
I was like, you know what, let's just see what happens.

1734
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,920
We had a phone call the day before I recorded that without your knowledge.

1735
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:56,240
Oh, I was freaked out because these guys could have done anything.

1736
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,240
I was going to their backyard.

1737
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:00,640
I wanted to scream at you and like say, dude, don't go.

1738
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:05,720
I know, but I had to, I had to learn the truth and that's what they were offering.

1739
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,720
They weren't offering money.

1740
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,200
They weren't offering anything like that.

1741
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:13,120
They were offering a chance to set me and set the record straight of what I witnessed.

1742
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:20,000
And I think after keeping this, you know, it's quiet for 14 plus years.

1743
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,360
I think I deserve the truth.

1744
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,120
I think everybody deserves the truth because for what's going on is absolute bullshit of

1745
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:33,000
why it's secret and why these guys feel in the right mind that they want to kidnap people

1746
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,400
or offer them a way out of their situation and use them as a biological equipment in

1747
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,920
these programs is just, it doesn't sit well with me.

1748
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:49,440
I understand why, but I think if there was some kind of government intervention with

1749
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:53,240
this that there may be good people that want to volunteer, maybe see what they can do and

1750
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,960
if they can, that's their thing.

1751
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,760
And I understand that these guys are also doing the same thing, but I think they're

1752
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,760
given false promises.

1753
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,040
I think they're being misled like they are because that's why they're partaking in this

1754
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,040
and they don't understand the magnitude of what they're doing.

1755
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:12,120
And from my current knowledge, I know that a lot of them don't know what they're getting

1756
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:16,640
involved with because they're heavily drugged and they can't recall what they're doing specifically

1757
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,560
with what they're making contact with.

1758
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,560
Yeah.

1759
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,560
I wanted to ask you about this.

1760
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:26,240
So it was during the NPC, you learned that these crates weren't trafficking drugs, but

1761
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,600
people.

1762
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,880
So I did a two day event prior to that.

1763
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,520
It was June 10th, 11th and 12th.

1764
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,000
Was it the 12th that the NPC was on?

1765
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah.

1766
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,120
And then a Daily Mail article came out the 10th or 11th and the NPC was out of the 12th.

1767
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:50,080
Because I had talked to Josh Boswell with Daily Mail prior to going to DC.

1768
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,460
And Greer was the one that set all that up.

1769
01:31:53,460 --> 01:32:02,640
And my goal as much as I possibly can is having some transparency because I think that's important.

1770
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,500
And as uncomfortable it is for me to be public.

1771
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:12,220
I don't enjoy it, but if I'm able to provide in any kind of asset to disclosure in any

1772
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,300
kind of way, I'm not here for money.

1773
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,300
Everybody knows that.

1774
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,740
I sleep good because I'm not for that cause.

1775
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:22,140
I make my own money as you guys know, you guys have seen.

1776
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:27,500
So and it's even crazier that I got employees that don't know what I'm doing.

1777
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,780
And I don't talk about it freely.

1778
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,300
There's some people who do and they're kind of curious.

1779
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,380
Did they just like kind of find out on their own?

1780
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,380
Yeah.

1781
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,340
Some people talk.

1782
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:41,180
So I assume that some people don't know because nobody asks me.

1783
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:45,100
Some people have seen what I did and they're texting me, man, that's, you know, they kind

1784
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,580
of try to get in detail with it.

1785
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:48,700
I'm like, I can't tell you much, man.

1786
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:56,100
You know this, you know, just jumping back to, I just wanted to emphasize that the biggest

1787
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:00,500
moment for me and you actually at this point, you're kind of like totally read into all

1788
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,340
of the evidence that I have.

1789
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:09,620
So like that meeting you had with the insider was the pivotal moment for me because that

1790
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:15,460
conversation that you and I had prior to the day before that meeting gave me very specific

1791
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:21,820
starting point to be able to track the helicopter.

1792
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:29,580
I knew the location where you guys were meeting and it just, it set up a way for me to verify

1793
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,580
a lot of things.

1794
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,580
Correct.

1795
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:33,140
It was an important piece of evidence.

1796
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:36,460
And so that is what led me to...

1797
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,260
To verify on your own accord.

1798
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,580
To verify without you even knowing.

1799
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:41,580
Correct.

1800
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:42,580
Where you went.

1801
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,180
I was really surprised when you told me after the fact.

1802
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:47,300
I was like, how the fuck did you find that?

1803
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:51,780
And I was like, okay, now that it's obvious after that point.

1804
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:58,260
And I think it was a good slip up to an extent because it was able to at least pinpoint somebody

1805
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,620
to be able to verify.

1806
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:07,380
Because with that helicopter flight, you were as well as I was able to provide other events

1807
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,380
that were going on.

1808
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:12,460
Yeah, that was the other thing because like prior to me revealing to you that I like

1809
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:17,620
tracked it on radar, I was like, hey, do you remember what time you took off and you told

1810
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:20,980
me and it was exactly what the radar said?

1811
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,340
I was like, holy crap.

1812
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:30,180
And then, yeah, there were some kind of limited time kind of events that were happening on

1813
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:36,420
the ground that could be visible from the air and you corroborated that.

1814
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:45,700
I was able to cross check that with local news and like I've spoken to you about how

1815
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,860
I authenticated the evidence and used...

1816
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:53,780
And the only thing I could say without going into specifics is you know where I went.

1817
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,780
Yeah.

1818
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:58,020
That's all we're going to talk about at the moment.

1819
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:02,460
And I know you know now because he's provided and I've okayed that because I think some

1820
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,620
people should know.

1821
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:05,660
I trust you guys.

1822
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,500
You've been by my side for a year without finally meeting you today.

1823
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,780
It's still crazy.

1824
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,780
Yes.

1825
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:15,620
But I can tell because I read people very well.

1826
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:16,740
That's where sales comes into.

1827
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:19,100
I can kind of gauge.

1828
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:23,380
And I know that you're for the truth and I know you are too.

1829
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,380
And I am as well.

1830
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:28,020
We're all in the same shoes as far as wanting this to come forward and wanting this whole

1831
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,740
thing to stop because our way of life can improve.

1832
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:36,460
The Insider provided a lot of information for you to disseminate.

1833
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:37,460
Yes.

1834
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:46,660
And granted, it was tough for me because they were in attendance and it was a group of day,

1835
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,660
not pronouns.

1836
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,940
They were in the NPC 2023.

1837
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,300
They were there but they were also there at the other events.

1838
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,980
The one three days before.

1839
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:55,660
It was two days.

1840
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,860
So it was a 10th, 11th and 12th.

1841
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:02,340
So it was during, was that on a Monday, the NPC?

1842
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,100
Let me look real quick.

1843
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:07,020
So you were talking about just a couple of days before the NPC.

1844
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:09,380
That's when you first kind of met these insiders.

1845
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:14,940
So I didn't meet them directly but I know that they were in attendance.

1846
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:21,780
And when I had presented on that Saturday, I believe, is when it was.

1847
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:22,780
Saturday and Sunday.

1848
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:29,940
Yeah, I think it was the Saturday and Sunday because I got in Friday afternoon or morning

1849
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,580
and then they went to the hotel.

1850
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,700
I had dinner with Greer and everybody kind of met them.

1851
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:39,940
Actually, it was a couple of drinks at the hotel.

1852
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:43,140
And then we got our rooms, got everything situated.

1853
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,060
Going downstairs, I introduced my wife to everybody too that I've already been kind

1854
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,940
of somewhat familiar with and talking to.

1855
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:52,540
And it was my first time of meeting some people like Michael Stratton person, Dr. Greer

1856
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,540
in person.

1857
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:56,980
Well, no, that'd be the second time because he was here in Boulder.

1858
01:36:56,980 --> 01:37:01,140
That's when I first actually met him and I was in 2017.

1859
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:08,420
And I was, I just kind of felt that he was somebody at the time who was talking about

1860
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:14,260
this and there were some things that he had hinted that were may have been maybe other

1861
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:17,060
people of experience would have experienced that he was talking to.

1862
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,940
So I wanted to tell him, Hey, this was my situation.

1863
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:24,660
You know, anybody else who went through this, maybe it's something I can convey and compare

1864
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:25,660
notes to this person.

1865
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:31,500
And of course, they don't, some of them are dead and some of them refuse to talk understandably.

1866
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,540
But yes, these insiders were there.

1867
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:38,660
So when I had did that event and it may be on YouTube, I can't find it anywhere.

1868
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:42,860
It may be on YouTube or some, because I know it was recorded because Dr. Greer and myself

1869
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:47,740
were kind of frustrated that their audio and video people were kind of slacking.

1870
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:58,980
I had given my piece that day and I had expressed that what I hypothesized was drugs, right?

1871
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:04,020
And that's when Dr. Greer pulled me aside and showed me his phone that had text message

1872
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:06,900
from this individual that had, he had this encrypted app.

1873
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:13,860
It was not signal with some other high tech communication platform did not look like signal.

1874
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:19,780
And I read the text message and what that text message said was, and my wife was actually

1875
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:24,260
sitting on the couch in the, in the green room and I was close to her and Dr. Greer was standing

1876
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:26,660
to my right.

1877
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:32,860
And the text message said, I don't want to leave Michael hanging, but I know what Michael

1878
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:40,340
saw and he went through this whole, he wrote a Bible essentially of what it was to an extent.

1879
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:48,100
But he had talked, he wanted to now talk to Dr. Greer privately and discuss what it was.

1880
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:52,620
And so I, at that point, because I was, I was volunteered security for him, which is

1881
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:56,380
what I'm doing with this too, but it's more of me to kind of see what the fuck else is

1882
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,380
going on.

1883
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:59,100
That's just how I can get information.

1884
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:03,900
So you do, you perform, you help benefit somebody, but you also get to kind of learn more in

1885
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:07,860
depth with what's kind of being going on and you get to be in the sensitive meetings and

1886
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:13,540
stuff and kind of really see, so it's kind of my personal way to kind of disseminate

1887
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:17,300
information and maybe be able to understand.

1888
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:22,820
That's just my curiosity, but I met that gentleman, which of course he didn't know that I knew

1889
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:26,060
who he was to an extent because Greer said he was going to meet with him and maybe they

1890
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:31,420
were going to put me in a green room and have a face-to-face conversation, which never happened.

1891
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:35,580
And then I wake up to a text message that he sent me at two o'clock in the morning.

1892
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:40,940
I don't remember what day, I still have it because I have it all saved, of course, just

1893
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:41,940
in case.

1894
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,980
I have a paper trail just in case anything happens.

1895
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:57,060
And he had said that a gentleman's name, to an extent, knows what I saw and would like

1896
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:02,900
to talk to me about it, and he is the knock, non-official covers what that stands for in

1897
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:12,180
the CIA term, and he gave me his phone number, which is one of many, at least that number.

1898
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:18,940
So I was like, oh shit, okay, and it wasn't like I wasn't expecting it because I was like,

1899
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:23,380
okay, this guy probably won't bother with me, he'll just tell Dr. Greer everything and

1900
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:29,460
then Dr. Greer will tell me what I dealt with and experienced, but that wasn't the case.

1901
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:36,500
So I sat on it for probably about a day or two because I was like, okay, here's a point

1902
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,860
and I'll return realistically, and then I was like, you know what, fuck it.

1903
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:48,060
So you're referring to he wanted to meet with you, what was the message that you sat on?

1904
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:52,900
So the message I sat on was Dr. Greer providing me his contact information.

1905
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,340
So that's what I sat on.

1906
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:59,820
And so I was just thinking every scenario in my head, like oh fuck, what am I going

1907
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:06,260
to, what is this doing, am I getting set up, was part of that too, I mean it's a percentage.

1908
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,020
Because I'm nervous, you know, I've already kind of said my piece, I'm nervous now the

1909
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:15,900
whole world knows what I disclosed and it was very uncomfortable, I hate fucking being

1910
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:20,940
public, but it's just, it's something that needs to be done.

1911
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:27,380
And he had, I called him and he did not answer and he did not have a voicemail set, so then

1912
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:31,820
I texted him and he responded immediately.

1913
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:35,620
And I have it, I have the text messages and basically what he said, he was going to fly

1914
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:41,220
me out somewhere and he was going to be able to provide me documentation among other things

1915
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:47,180
that will help me with this, but now that I came forward, these guys were working in

1916
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,180
that organization that I witnessed doing this operation.

1917
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:55,220
He had some insight to tell me and that's what we did, we met up and you had the phone

1918
01:41:55,220 --> 01:42:02,620
call of that and you have some details about where I met this gentleman particularly and

1919
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:05,620
where he flew me off to, to provide me more information.

1920
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:10,100
Now why do you feel like he wanted to meet you in person versus just talking on the phone

1921
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,220
or video call, that sort of thing?

1922
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,420
Like what was that?

1923
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,460
I think it was establishing trust.

1924
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:21,220
It's easy to talk to people on the phone, getting face to face with people and having

1925
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:22,620
them tell you things.

1926
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:27,300
Now granted, when him and I met and we were sitting across from each other, and I've said

1927
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:31,540
this in multiple interviews, but I had my phone off because he had had this one that

1928
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:36,620
can detect any chips and I showed you the text message, or the message that he sent

1929
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:41,780
me talking about why they did that and which they're all chipped.

1930
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:45,540
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

1931
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:50,860
But I guess it was a chance to get the truth and I can tell when he was talking to me that

1932
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:55,700
he was very fidgety and very nervous because he doesn't know who I am and I don't know

1933
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,700
who he is.

1934
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:00,000
So him being nervous, but he looked through my background.

1935
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,520
He looked at every possible detail about me, so he knew everything.

1936
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,440
So I know that he knew that wasn't some asset planted in trying to fish people out, which

1937
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:12,360
I know is a concern of theirs, which is why they're screening people heavily and do what

1938
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,000
they do.

1939
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:20,800
So which I was just as nervous and that's when he, during that interview or meet up,

1940
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:27,120
that meeting, that's when he provided me a sidearm as a way to establish trust.

1941
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:31,920
And I looked at the bullets and there were no struck primers, nothing like that, popped

1942
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,840
it in, wrapped it, put it on a lap like this and nobody else was armed.

1943
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,400
At that point, I kind of started getting to know him a little bit personally, some personal

1944
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,920
details about who he is and what he does and other things.

1945
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:50,520
He's got a family, which is great because it tells me he's on the right side of things

1946
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:55,000
and he loves his family very much as you should.

1947
01:43:55,080 --> 01:44:00,160
And that kind of gave me hope that, okay, this guy actually is taking that into consideration,

1948
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,160
which tells me everything.

1949
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:06,320
And his body language was also what conveyed it to me too because he's very fidgety with

1950
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,320
his watch.

1951
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,600
He's kind of like trying to adjust himself and it's like, okay, I know you're telling

1952
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:14,480
the truth because this is making you uncomfortable as much as it is making me.

1953
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:19,040
And there was also sort of an apology that he gave to you.

1954
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,040
Yes, he did.

1955
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,040
Can you talk about that a little bit?

1956
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:25,600
He apologized saying that he's sorry that we went through that, that it's absolutely

1957
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,760
unnecessary and it's bullshit and that shouldn't be happening to anybody.

1958
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,560
And he knows of instances where they, yes, they have murdered people, not him directly,

1959
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,600
but he will never kill a patriot.

1960
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:40,400
He will never kill innocent people, but that guy will murder and kill bad guys as it should

1961
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,480
be because he's like a sheepdog.

1962
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,880
And all of these guys that I'm working with are the same way.

1963
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,680
They're all good people.

1964
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:50,320
And some people have had confusion to say, oh, we're, we're, how the gunpoint with these

1965
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:54,600
guys and all of a sudden they're welcoming me in and, and giving me this, this knowledge

1966
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:55,600
and trust.

1967
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,080
No, it's not the same people.

1968
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,080
These are the good guys.

1969
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,080
Very few.

1970
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:02,520
So these guys weren't involved with the operation you witnessed in 2009.

1971
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:03,520
No, they were not.

1972
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,120
But they are aware of those types of.

1973
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,120
Yes.

1974
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:10,440
And they've been on similar operations as that to my understanding.

1975
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,880
And so he showed you some things.

1976
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:14,880
Yes.

1977
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,640
You've said you went underground.

1978
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,640
I can't talk about any of this.

1979
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:19,640
Okay.

1980
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:24,320
I don't, I don't, I'm not going to ask you what you saw.

1981
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:30,240
What I, what I want to ask you is why did he show you that in the sense of?

1982
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:36,400
What, what you could ask is what the things that he has been able to show you were proof.

1983
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,640
It was a way of him able to prove who he said, who he really was.

1984
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,280
That's exactly what I was.

1985
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:47,560
It wasn't like I can just take his word and just say, okay, I trust you.

1986
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:52,000
It was a way for them to say, these are the real deal guys.

1987
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,080
Because it's not like anybody can just see this shit.

1988
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:59,360
And I hope one day I can get to a point where I can talk about that.

1989
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,400
And because it is, it is mind blowing.

1990
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:06,800
And I thought what I witnessed on, in 14, 15 years ago was mind blowing.

1991
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,280
Yes, it is.

1992
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:13,120
But now you actually see things face to face of what, you know.

1993
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:25,560
Because, I'll put it this way, that facility, if these guys were to link up with two politicians

1994
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:32,480
and then give them a free access card to everything, it would single-handedly blow the doors

1995
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:40,640
off of this whole chicanery of misinformation and all the lies and all the deceit that are

1996
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,640
being there.

1997
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,640
This would prove everything.

1998
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:47,280
They're doing that right now, but they're trying to plan it out.

1999
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,560
And what way I don't know, but that's what their goal is.

2000
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:57,760
And I can't give any details about that being mic'd up and all this, but I can tell you otherwise.

2001
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,160
But they're upset.

2002
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,080
A lot of them are upset.

2003
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:08,520
I guess what I'm getting at is like, what's their objective with this?

2004
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:14,280
With reaching out to you and informing this partnership or relationship with you, what

2005
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:16,200
is their ultimate motive?

2006
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:22,360
Because these are people who are first-hand participants in the program.

2007
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,280
Yes, for 30-plus years.

2008
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,280
Yeah.

2009
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,280
And so their pro-disclosure to a certain extent?

2010
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,720
Pro-American, pro-freedom, pro-life.

2011
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:36,000
You know, obviously they don't like that people are being murdered over this kind of stuff.

2012
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,280
So there's kind of factions within...

2013
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:42,880
Yes, that's exactly what people call the program, and these are kind of considered the good

2014
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:52,160
guys who want to support some level of disclosure and restore an oversight by Congress.

2015
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:58,760
So the other reason is that these guys were somewhat tasked to try to go through us or

2016
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,960
infiltrate, right?

2017
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,960
I think what would have happened is these guys would have been whistleblowers or considered

2018
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,960
whistleblowers themselves.

2019
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:12,240
Not in a public fashion like I'm doing or anybody else that's in my shoes.

2020
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:19,960
But I think what happened was now that I came forward and what I experienced is directly

2021
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:24,800
related and directly involved with what they've been doing, it was more of a chance for them

2022
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:30,120
to say, okay, we can lay low, but now we have a spokesperson for us that can get this information

2023
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:34,560
out and help us get information out to the right people.

2024
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,520
And that was successful and they'll be able to do that.

2025
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,920
But I was also successful and able to get them in contact with certain other prominent

2026
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,920
people.

2027
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:46,000
Do these guys, these insiders have any fear of coming forward?

2028
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,400
I personally have talked to some whistleblowers who are allegedly afraid to speak because

2029
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,560
they will lose pension, they will basically, they and their family will not have a way

2030
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:55,560
to provide.

2031
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:01,760
Yes, they will lose everything if this is not done correctly and carefully.

2032
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,760
And again, I don't know if these guys are coming forward.

2033
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:07,640
I can't specifically say that, I don't know.

2034
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,480
I just, maybe one day they will.

2035
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,480
Who knows?

2036
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:21,280
What do you think needs to happen or if you can convey what these guys have said, what

2037
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:27,120
needs to happen or change in order for more first-hand participants like them to be able

2038
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,480
to come forward, what needs to happen?

2039
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:33,720
The tables need to flip as far as the, the majority of these people in these programs

2040
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,120
are good people.

2041
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:39,520
That's what I, from my own interactions with some of these people, granted I'm not working

2042
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,360
with everybody, right?

2043
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:45,240
But the ones that I know very well now, they're good people, they got their heart in the right

2044
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:48,020
place and they got the right mindset for this.

2045
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:54,080
What would need to happen is that the tables need to turn as far as them flipping the tables

2046
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:59,600
on their own programs, meaning taking control of them personally, getting the bad guys or

2047
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:04,520
neutralizing that, however, because what people need to understand is that this group is the

2048
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:10,760
enforcement arm of even the political corruption that's going on because they have assets in

2049
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:17,720
certain places in government, local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, military, everywhere.

2050
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:23,120
So if they were able to single-handedly take the bad guys out or flip the script or gain

2051
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:29,120
control of that, because right now there's a war between the good and bad of these factions.

2052
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:32,960
The bad guys want to keep this secret and they want to keep this technology to themselves

2053
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,920
and they want to commit crimes against humanity with this technology and have this power and

2054
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:43,000
control while the good guys want this to come forward and everybody benefit from it and

2055
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,320
us as a species be able to survive.

2056
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,840
Also the fact that they know directly what is going on because they're living in this

2057
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:50,840
world.

2058
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,720
Day-to-day job, so to speak.

2059
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:58,200
So I think now that they have an opportunity to understand that this is affecting other

2060
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:04,880
people besides me, besides, I mean, it's affecting all of us because we could be, we could really

2061
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:14,280
be far in life with this technology and not only that, we could stop shooting down NHI

2062
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:22,760
because who's to say, I've never met any of them, I don't know any ETs or NHI, I can't,

2063
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,160
never came face to face with them.

2064
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:30,760
What I can tell you is that I know that the universe is massive and there's multi-dimensional

2065
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:35,640
universes or however this works with the theories that people have proposed and if that really

2066
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:41,200
is the case, the possibility that we can come across a species that ain't going to be too

2067
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,760
friendly with us is a possibility.

2068
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:48,400
So you're telling, and this is what the concept is, so this group is going to target them,

2069
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:57,080
shoot them down in the deserts, all over the world, in secluded areas and they are going

2070
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:02,920
to come across at a point maybe someday that they're going to shoot down the wrong type

2071
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:07,480
and maybe that type becomes a type that decides that, hey, you know what, we don't need these

2072
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:12,960
people around, we don't need this species around and they decide that we as people

2073
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:20,960
who don't even partake in that nonsense have to pay for it, meaning that our lives end

2074
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:26,800
as they can instantly do it if they wanted to with what I have been told and what I've

2075
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:32,800
understand how powerful they are if they're able to travel inter-dimensionally and through

2076
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,640
time and space and be able to show up here and go to any other place that they want to

2077
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:43,640
go and be able to control craft through consciousness and be able to pretty much, the way that they

2078
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:48,080
even said that, and this is just speculation of course because I've never seen this personally,

2079
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,680
but the way that they are actually able to be go through things, be inter-dimensional

2080
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:56,800
so it can be in 3D or just have the image of, but they can also pass through solid objects

2081
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,040
like it's almost them, their molecules or atoms splitting between all of those to separate

2082
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:07,120
them somehow, so that's just speculation, but that's what I've been told.

2083
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:12,160
And so if you have something that advanced and some very smart that can end our lives,

2084
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:16,280
this whole planet if they wanted to, and for some reason they choose not to, but yet we

2085
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:22,360
keep shooting them down, and that means us as a human species.

2086
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:27,000
So you described kind of the next step forward is for the good guys to kind of flip the tables

2087
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:34,120
on the bad guys, but what about the whole side of like legislation? Is that still an important

2088
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,280
factor?

2089
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:44,960
Well that allows certain things to happen to where there's involvement from both sides

2090
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:50,160
because there's laws that have to be abided by, there has to be military involvement to

2091
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:56,660
an extent, and there also has to be a law enforcement effort because essentially there's

2092
01:53:56,660 --> 01:54:00,060
a lot of laws being broken with all of these, and that's kind of the thing that maybe they

2093
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:03,580
can get them on a technicality to get some laws passed that now all of a sudden these

2094
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:08,100
guys can't hide within that because now there's proof that there's stuff going on that the

2095
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:11,420
law enforcement like U.S. Marshals for example, because they have jurisdiction everywhere,

2096
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:17,820
it could be the ones to execute whatever they need to, that's just technically speaking.

2097
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:24,740
And what about like how can we get more people like the insiders you're working with to come

2098
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:29,980
forward? Are there, you know, there seems to be kind of like, yeah, we have whistleblower

2099
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:32,580
protection, but it's really not enough.

2100
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:35,020
It's really not enough, and that's exactly their concern.

2101
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:39,580
Yeah, so what do they think needs to be done from that aspect?

2102
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:44,260
These politicians need to get their shit together, and they can't be corrupt like we're seeing

2103
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:48,420
with the whole pushback of the M&N domain and all that kind of stuff because these aerospace

2104
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:52,100
companies are paying some of these guys. So of course, hey, we'll throw you an X amount

2105
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:56,180
of money if you play ball for us and make it to where it's hard for them to accomplish

2106
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,860
what they want because then all of a sudden the game's up.

2107
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:02,020
These aerospace companies know what's going on. They're going to pretend that they don't,

2108
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:06,500
but they have access to this shit. And it may not even be the executives of these companies

2109
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:10,580
who know what's going on, but the contractors and the people that are within these groups

2110
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:13,060
know exactly what's going on and have access to it.

2111
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:18,020
And it's a very, it's relatively a small number. It's not like every single Boeing personnel

2112
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:24,780
or a Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or Northrop Grumman for that matter would have, every single

2113
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:29,260
person knows what's going on. They don't. Only certain groups in that do.

2114
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:33,060
And to touch quickly on what you were talking about about shooting down these craft, are

2115
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:37,300
you aware of in the program with these insiders if there's kind of an ethical tug of war going

2116
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:38,300
on that?

2117
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,300
100%.

2118
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,300
Okay.

2119
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:44,980
And that's kind of why they feel the need to want to divulge information to me to spread

2120
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,740
it to you guys and to the world for that matter.

2121
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:53,540
The other aspect of it too is over these installations that civilian aircraft are being targeted as

2122
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:58,020
well when they're flying into these temporary flight restricted areas or TFRs.

2123
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:01,820
And it's in people, they will go for a flight, want to go see some scenic views of some of

2124
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:06,340
these areas that are beautiful nearby, but happen to stumble into the area just like we

2125
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:12,900
did at the wrong point of time. And now they get hit with these experimental weapons. Well,

2126
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:17,460
you can't even call them experimental because they're using them. They're not known. They're

2127
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,900
relatively, yeah.

2128
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:23,500
Are you aware of what these offensive UAP weapons are, how they work?

2129
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:28,700
I can't give specifics to it. It's a lot of them. I've only been, I only know of a few,

2130
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:31,860
but as far as the other ones that are more cutting edge, because like again, they keep

2131
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:36,180
refining their systems because they want to make sure that they can just take them out

2132
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:42,820
with a single hit and have an easier time doing it, I would suppose. That's just speculation,

2133
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:47,780
but they're always refining their stuff. They're always refining their reverse engineer

2134
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:52,620
technologies as well, which is why they test these weapons systems on them. So they had

2135
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:58,380
to explain that they put them, they put craft on balloons, have them go up to high altitude

2136
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:02,140
and then they hit them with these weapons because there's nobody aboard, right? And

2137
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:05,220
then they also have them stationary on the ground and they can hit them at different

2138
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:14,660
angles to make sure that it's, but what they have explained to me was that their EMP proof,

2139
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:21,660
what they have, they are, they are not vulnerable to any kind of modern ammunition like rifle

2140
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:28,020
bullets or 50 cal machine gun ammo or ammunition or rounds. Missiles can't penetrate through

2141
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:29,020
their weapons.

2142
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:30,020
You're talking about UAP?

2143
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,020
That they have, yes.

2144
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:32,020
Okay.

2145
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:33,020
They meaning?

2146
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:34,020
Yes.

2147
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:35,020
That they've designed and made.

2148
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:36,020
Oh, okay.

2149
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:41,020
So like the ARV reverse engineer, okay.

2150
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:45,140
Yes. Most of the ones that are coming out, and this is what some of the insiders had

2151
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:52,740
said. They are having a very hard time distinguishing the real craft from NHI compared to the ones

2152
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:58,580
that they've got. That's how far they've came with this technology. They can't identify

2153
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:01,500
one from the other. It's getting to that point.

2154
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:07,820
So it's practically been a year, almost within a week since you came forward.

2155
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:08,820
Correct.

2156
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:16,620
What's next for you? Has your motivation for coming forward now changed? Has your objective

2157
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:22,940
now changed now that you've met with the insider and kind of gotten involved with that side?

2158
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:28,940
Yes it has because I feel like I can now help these guys in any way that I possibly can.

2159
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:33,140
I've been doing that behind the scenes and it's good. It feels good to do that. It feels

2160
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:37,380
good to be on the right set of history with this and when everything does come to a head,

2161
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:42,100
hopefully there can be some positive movements that blow this all wide open and we can all

2162
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,380
benefit. We could all be better people at the end of the day. That's what I want. That's

2163
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:46,820
my mission.

2164
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:51,140
The other aspect is obviously being provided the information that people are being taken

2165
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:56,900
and used in these programs. That doesn't sit well with me. When I heard that, I couldn't

2166
01:58:56,940 --> 01:59:00,420
sleep for a week. There's many times where I've hidden in the bathroom and literally

2167
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:05,100
busted down fucking crime because it's like, I couldn't do anything to stop that at that

2168
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:12,100
time, which sucks to know that. You're completely helpless. So I feel like it's my mission

2169
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:17,660
to get the right oversight to an extent and maybe there can be things that can happen

2170
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:23,740
on a global scale that get these programs to be known programs and maybe the right ways

2171
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:27,820
can be done with these where people don't have to be sedated. People don't have to be

2172
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:32,980
treated as if they're biological equipment or pink assets, as they call them, that they

2173
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:38,420
can actually have people gain a foothold and do this peacefully and make us all better

2174
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:45,300
people and everybody can live happily. Everybody can live evolved. We can stop paying utilities

2175
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:50,100
because free energy will be a thing. Maybe I got fast cars, but maybe I can get some

2176
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:54,940
faster shit that I can drive around or fly around in for that matter. However, that comes

2177
01:59:54,940 --> 02:00:01,940
about. But I think what the optimism is that our world can be significantly better, but

2178
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:09,620
we have to go through some very hard times for this to happen. I don't have children,

2179
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:14,380
but I know you do and I know that your children do benefit from having a better world that

2180
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:18,020
they can grow up and experience and not have to go through the corruption and see what

2181
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:22,780
we're dealing with as people right now who understand what's going on. And I know these

2182
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:28,340
insiders families also deserve the same. Like I said, I don't want any money from this.

2183
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:33,100
All I want is for this to come forward. All I want is this world to get better and change.

2184
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:40,100
That's my mission. Anybody who has any problems with me not accepting money? Tough shit.

2185
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:45,620
I make my own money. I'm not bought and paid for like most of these people who try to keep

2186
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:49,780
this shit hidden or secret or threaten them. They can threaten me all they want, but all

2187
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:54,460
it's doing is pissing us off and get us pissed off enough. And we actually do something that

2188
02:00:54,460 --> 02:01:00,460
actually, because here's the problem. As much as I would like to say or believe me, everybody,

2189
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:06,380
because what I'm saying can be verified to an extent, which I choose not to because I'm

2190
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:13,380
keeping people safe in the process, as you guys know, but be skeptical.

2191
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:20,140
Because there are people coming forward who should not be or they're muddying the waters

2192
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:24,820
to an extent and they're very known people. I don't get in drama of this shit. I don't

2193
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:29,580
care to. I've got my direction of where I'm going and that's what I'm focused on. I let

2194
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:35,140
other people gossip and talk while I'm just focused. So that's what they can do. People

2195
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:38,820
need to understand that yes, as much as I want people to believe what I'm saying, but

2196
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:43,460
at the end of the day, disclosure is about evidence. It's not about testimony. It's not

2197
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:47,780
about what I say. If I had proof.

2198
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:51,300
So you think evidence is coming at some point?

2199
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:57,100
Very much so. How it will happen, I have no idea. But I hope it does and I hope it comes

2200
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:00,740
full force because then it's going to kind of catch a lot of people with their pants

2201
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:04,580
down. People who pretend in the government that they don't know what's going on, but

2202
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:09,660
they fully will do because they're getting paid from it under the table. So it's going

2203
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:13,980
to be interesting how, oh yeah, you didn't know that this existed, but here's some documentation

2204
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:18,140
or some people are saying that you were being paid for it. But yet they got this material

2205
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:23,940
or whatever it is that they have that's actually out. And now people know for a fact, oh shit,

2206
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:30,020
NHIRT exists guys. And we've had access to this and we've been in communication to an

2207
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:32,460
extent for a very long time.

2208
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:38,380
And I just got to ask two quick closing questions if you don't mind. I think it was on the Total

2209
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:43,580
Disclosure podcast. You talked about that you had been in contact with David Grush. Can

2210
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:45,180
you comment on that?

2211
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:47,580
I've talked to him and that's all I can say.

2212
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:51,060
Okay. And two, this is just kind of a personal one because I've seen this bounced around

2213
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:57,020
a lot. I have seen many people call you Joey and Joey your publicist. You two are not the

2214
02:02:57,020 --> 02:03:00,220
same person. And Joey, are you Michael's publicist?

2215
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:01,220
Not at all.

2216
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,860
Are you anything other than a private citizen who's investigating Michael's case?

2217
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:05,180
Just a random guy.

2218
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:06,460
Are you paid for by Michael?

2219
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:07,460
No.

2220
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:08,460
Oh man.

2221
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:09,460
Yeah.

2222
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:13,340
I know. I can imagine that's the skepticism going on.

2223
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:21,180
It's just like Reddit. Most people are just anonymous on Reddit. And I just remained anonymous

2224
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:26,180
and now I'm showing my face now for the first time and just trying to crack that open a

2225
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,180
little bit.

2226
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:28,180
Yeah.

2227
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:31,780
Well, I mean, there'll be a right time where everything can be divorced and everybody can

2228
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:36,140
sleep better, you know? But I just saw what you were doing on Reddit and it's like, you

2229
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:39,820
know what? You're a very good person to get information out. I don't know anybody else.

2230
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:44,940
And thanks to you, thanks to you, you've been able to link me up with people who have.

2231
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:45,940
That's true too.

2232
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:46,940
Yeah.

2233
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:49,700
You're very good at networking too. And that's part of the reason why I'm successful is

2234
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:54,100
because networking is key. And that's, I use the same approach with disclosure. So if

2235
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:58,700
I'm in touch with people who are pivotal with this movement, then I'm able to contribute

2236
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:03,380
in ways that I possibly can to bring this forward to an extent or however far we can

2237
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:08,020
get. And you introduced me to him, you know, which is great because you guys are wonderful

2238
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:12,820
guys, very good people, you know? So it's good talking to you guys and just even shooting

2239
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:16,100
a shit when we're not talking about this kind of stuff, you know?

2240
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,820
I can't believe we're sitting here and this is just.

2241
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:19,820
I know.

2242
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:20,820
It's been a long time coming.

2243
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:24,060
It's been a long time. I'm like, you know, if I had time to go out there, I'd definitely

2244
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:28,340
go out there and see where, you know, what your part of the world is like and see what

2245
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:30,340
you do day to day and you get to experience.

2246
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:32,740
You certainly keep busy with everything that you've got to do.

2247
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:37,500
Yeah. I'm surprised I'm not completely bald yet. It's getting there, but I got some hymns

2248
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:42,620
I'm trying. So hopefully that helps. But, you know, if not, then I'm just going to be

2249
02:04:42,620 --> 02:04:44,620
another whistleblower that's bald.

2250
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:45,620
Yeah, dude. Rock it.

2251
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:53,620
Well, this was awesome. I'm, you know, so grateful that you sat down with us and just,

2252
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:58,180
yeah, excited to kind of see how things unfold moving forward.

2253
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:05,180
