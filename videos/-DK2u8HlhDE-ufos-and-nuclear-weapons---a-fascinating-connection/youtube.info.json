    "description": "When you think about UFOs and Nuclear weapons, a link between the two does not immediately come to mind.... But on this planet, and throughout the Cold War, UAP has had an interest in humanity's harnessing of the atom, and in some direct cases, actually tampered with or disabled Nuclear Warheads. \n\nIn this video, we will cover the fascinating cases of Lt. Robert Jacob's Vandenberg AFB UFO footage and the Malmstrom Minuteman Missile shutdown case, two of the most perplexing and well-documented UFO nuclear encounters.\n\nThe credibility of these cases cannot be understated - Jacob's case was reported to Dr. Kirkpatrick of AARO in 2023 and the Malmstrom case was directly confirmed by David Grusch in his 2023 News Week article. BOTH cases feature sworn affidavits by multiple witnesses.\n\nWhy are UFOs so interested in nuclear weapons? Is it because whatever non-human intelligence piloting these craft is frightened of human weaponry being used against them or something a little more scientific, like an observation of a civilization encountering the great filter? We can only guess until we have more data, but cases like these help us begin to hypothesize. \n\nThank you for watching UAP Gerb Gang and please remember to like and subscribe!\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:38 Jacobs UFO Tape\n8:15 Malmstrom AFB Incident\n11:13 1977 FOIA Reports\n11:42 Indian Point Nuclear Station UFO\n13:22 Conclusion\n\nLt.
