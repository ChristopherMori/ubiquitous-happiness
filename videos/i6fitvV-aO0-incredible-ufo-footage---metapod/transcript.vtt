00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
More often than not, UFO footage is grainy, blurry, minuscule, and difficult to make out,

00:07.360 --> 00:12.160
or is a collection of pixels on a downgraded USG FLIR platform.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.400
This often leads to the video's feeling impersonal.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.280
But how often do you get to see a truly anomalous craft up close?

00:19.280 --> 00:26.400
Well, there is one video of a UFO filmed in Spain that, if true, is one of the best close-up

00:26.400 --> 00:29.280
views of a UFO ever recorded.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.520
Guys, I am UAPGurb, and I'm not wasting any time today.

00:33.520 --> 00:39.360
So let's do another footage analysis of one of my favorite pieces of alleged UFO footage,

00:39.360 --> 00:47.520
the famous Metapod, as filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

00:47.520 --> 00:52.640
This is one of my all-time favorite pieces of alleged footage that has shocking connections

00:52.640 --> 00:55.520
to other sightings and footage worldwide.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.400
So let's take a look first at our footage stabilized.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.280
Let's take a look at the footage.

02:01.280 --> 02:09.280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

02:09.280 --> 02:19.280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

02:19.280 --> 02:29.280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

02:29.280 --> 02:39.280
This is a footage of a UFO filmed in El Escorial Madrid, Spain on the 6th of September 2015.

02:39.280 --> 02:52.880
So what do you think after first watch?

02:52.880 --> 02:54.400
Pretty astounding, right?

02:54.400 --> 02:59.280
Similar to the fly-by video, this footage is too anomalous, too clear,

02:59.280 --> 03:02.240
and too strange to possibly be true, right?

03:02.800 --> 03:06.320
Well, let's start a little analysis and kind of see what we can uncover.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.840
I want to disclaim that I am using YouTube channel ItsBS's stabilized footage of the

03:11.840 --> 03:19.040
metapod due to the fact that the original poster of this video UFO VNI has taken down the footage

03:19.040 --> 03:23.920
as well as the 2017 reupload by YouTube channel UFO invasions.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.520
ItsBS's channel will be listed in the video description.

03:28.400 --> 03:36.960
Unlike fly-by, we can actually trace back the origins of the metapod footage.

03:37.520 --> 03:46.320
On September 7th, 2015, a man named Modesta emailed YouTube channel UFO VNI as mentioned above

03:46.320 --> 03:49.600
after reading that this channel could publish UFO footage.

03:50.320 --> 03:55.760
On screen now is the original email, and here let me read a transcription translated into English.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.400
Hello UFO VNI. I have read on your YouTube page that you can publish the video that I took the

04:02.400 --> 04:09.120
day before yesterday, September 6th, 2015, together with a friend named Moises. My name

04:09.120 --> 04:15.280
is Modesto. What we saw yesterday I sincerely know was not from here. I have been in the

04:15.280 --> 04:19.360
countryside for many years and I have been able to hear the wings of storks in flight.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.320
What we saw did not make any noise, it descended vertically and he walked away.

04:25.120 --> 04:30.560
I must admit that I am somewhat nearsighted but my friend can see hairs and quails in the same way

04:30.560 --> 04:35.920
as finding a needle in a haystack. My friend commented that he saw something moving inside

04:35.920 --> 04:42.160
the UFO. Something alive with limbs, I believe it. Due to personal reasons and the location

04:42.160 --> 04:46.640
of the sighting we do not want to give the exact location of the sighting, but I can tell you that

04:46.640 --> 04:54.400
it was near El Escorial, direction Las Navas del Marques. El Escorial is a place where strange

04:54.400 --> 05:00.160
things happen, but not in the city, but in the nearby mountains. Personally, I neither believed

05:00.160 --> 05:06.720
nor did I believe in UFOs or extraterrestrials. It simply seemed like, quote, nonsense from Uncle

05:06.720 --> 05:12.720
Iker and four other idiots, end quote. Now, that is, from that moment on, I knew that it wasn't

05:12.720 --> 05:18.240
from here, that it wasn't human. My friend Modesto, however, a little more attack at turn

05:18.240 --> 05:23.520
and from the town than me, I never known what he thought but it seems that he is not surprised

05:23.520 --> 05:29.200
to see it. After the video that I sent him and some photos that, as you will see, did not turn

05:29.200 --> 05:35.680
out very well, my friend Modesto told me, quote, here again, in reference to the object. After

05:35.680 --> 05:40.640
asking him about the meaning of his expression, he did not want to say much more, except that it

05:40.640 --> 05:46.000
is not the first time he has seen it and that his father, now deceased, had also seen it.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.200
If it is of importance to him, I will ask, give him the GPS data and exact location,

05:51.200 --> 05:56.160
but only for his investigation so that he does not make said data or the relationship with

05:56.160 --> 06:02.800
the video public. The place is called redacted and is at the coordinates redacted in the direction

06:02.800 --> 06:08.400
in which he went was north south. I asked for strict rigor and commitment to save my personal

06:08.400 --> 06:14.320
or contact information. On the contrary, I send and deliver the video and I give it to you. For

06:14.320 --> 06:20.080
your use and disposition as you please. PS, I'll send you the video later with a link to the cloud

06:20.080 --> 06:26.320
or if you prefer, I'll send you the micro SD card by email. What stands out to me about this email?

06:26.320 --> 06:32.640
Well, for one, the sender Modesto claims that he is Modesto and his friend Moises recorded the

06:32.640 --> 06:39.280
footage. Later on, he says, quote, my friend Modesto. Is this a careless mistake of using pseudonyms

06:39.280 --> 06:44.400
as the sender was already unwilling to provide the exact location of the sighting? Anyways,

06:44.400 --> 06:49.680
Modesto goes on to state that this was not the first time his friend had seen this object

06:49.680 --> 06:55.600
and that his father had seen it also. Modesto's companion also said he saw something moving

06:55.600 --> 07:02.480
inside of the UFO. It's unknown to me why UFO V and I took down this video, perhaps at Modesto's

07:02.480 --> 07:08.320
request, but I have contacted him to learn more. Posts about this footage began popping up around

07:08.320 --> 07:14.080
the internet almost immediately, as seen in this now taken down Portuguese forum on September 8,

07:14.080 --> 07:21.600
2015, called ETS and ETC. Translating this page, we can see the site does not know if the video

07:21.600 --> 07:28.400
is real or fake, but is impressed nonetheless. What caught this site's attention was realistic zoom,

07:29.040 --> 07:35.920
very realistic focus and blur, the shape of the UFO, and similarities to the 2006 La Bruja in

07:35.920 --> 07:41.680
Mexico. I'll cover this soon. A post also appeared on the site Third Phase of the Sun

07:41.680 --> 07:47.600
on September 11, 2015, which additionally detailed UFO V and I's correspondence with Modesto.

07:51.920 --> 08:16.480
I'm willing to bet you've probably never seen a UFO in this shape, especially one structured like

08:16.560 --> 08:24.480
such a physical craft in which a solid metallic reflective looking material makes up the back

08:24.480 --> 08:32.000
bulk of the craft in a very logical design with a front-facing transparent material that looks

08:32.000 --> 08:39.600
almost similar to glass for, you know, possible viewing opportunities. Some argue, like Third

08:39.600 --> 08:46.000
Phase of the Sun, that they can make out a bean resting inside of the craft. However, I disagree

08:46.000 --> 08:50.720
here and think this is simply the reflection of sunlight on the transparent material on the front

08:50.720 --> 08:58.000
face of the craft. This pod features three of five characteristics of UAP as listed by ATIP

08:58.000 --> 09:12.880
and Lou Elizondo. Instantaneous acceleration as seen in the altitude drop, anti-gravity slash

09:12.880 --> 09:26.560
no visible signs of propulsion, and low observability. The craft exhibits intelligent flight characteristics

09:26.560 --> 09:32.480
including that sudden drop in altitude, standstill and winds as we can hear from camera wind

09:32.480 --> 09:42.960
interference, linear traversal away from the recorder, and variable stable rotation along

09:42.960 --> 09:50.000
its x-axis. Especially take note here when the craft's rotation goes from counterclockwise

09:50.000 --> 10:07.280
to clockwise, exhibiting variable acceleration in both methods of rotation.

10:11.360 --> 10:17.840
I'd like to thank Reddit user UNVMBKY for translating the audio in this footage. I'm

10:17.840 --> 10:24.480
going to overlay his translation with the original footage, and to note something added by NVBKY,

10:25.040 --> 10:30.480
the audio sounds like it has been processed with a noise reduction filter, either added in post

10:30.480 --> 10:45.120
processing or directly applied by the camera to filter out the wind.

12:00.480 --> 12:19.840
As you can guess, many have tried to debunk this sighting as a balloon, such as this heart

12:19.840 --> 12:25.520
custom made balloon, or balloon tent, and no I'm not kidding, this comparison with this

12:25.520 --> 12:31.920
flatable tent is used as an actual source for a debunk, or possibly an object suspended on a string

12:31.920 --> 12:36.800
which is the same explanation used to try and debunk the very real McMinnville photographs,

12:37.360 --> 12:44.080
and lastly CGI. The CGI debunkers enjoy using these three frames of craft jitter when analyzing

12:44.080 --> 12:49.200
the craft altitude drop stabilized, but even the balloon crowd detracts from this argument

12:49.200 --> 12:53.920
on Mick West's website Metabunk, in which the jitters are consistent with the craft,

12:54.000 --> 13:00.720
or in this case balloon, experiencing altitude drops in air currents. Of course, I'm no VFX

13:00.720 --> 13:06.560
artist so I cannot comment on any visual artifacts that could either confirm or deny the footage's

13:06.560 --> 13:12.640
authenticity, but what I can tell you is that for me, this footage passes the simple eye test,

13:12.640 --> 13:19.760
and I can draw attention to half a dozen pieces of other footage in which this same craft is shown.

13:24.480 --> 13:29.680
While we review these other sightings, I want you to take note of a couple things in all of the

13:29.680 --> 13:36.560
footage we are about to view. The overall crescent moon shape of the pod, the transparent glass-like

13:36.560 --> 13:43.360
material on one face of the pod, reflectivity of sunlight off the craft, and the vertical

13:43.360 --> 13:49.600
orientation in which the craft stands when it rotates about its z-axis. The first observation

13:49.600 --> 13:56.160
I can track of the metapod shape is the famous Los Perracadistas de Maipú or the parachutes

13:56.160 --> 14:02.320
of Maipú footage taken in 1998 in Peru. In this footage, we can see what appears to be five or

14:02.320 --> 14:08.160
more pots with the same body and reflective paneling as our metapod footage. Now, let's cover the

14:08.160 --> 14:15.280
aforementioned Monterey Witch or La Bruja as seen in Mexico in 2006. This footage appears to show the

14:15.280 --> 14:20.240
backside, the non-transparent side of the metapod moving away from the recorder, through some

14:20.240 --> 14:24.160
hills and brush in the same vertical positioning I mentioned earlier.

14:33.920 --> 14:40.240
In 2021 in Vancouver, the same pod was recorded. Here we observe the same crescent moon shape

14:40.240 --> 14:45.760
and reflectivity in sunlight. Some interesting things to take note of by the OP of this footage.

14:46.480 --> 14:52.320
Three of these objects appeared, close together at first maybe 20 feet from each other moving north.

14:52.880 --> 14:58.000
They moved on a horizontal plane, two of the objects then ascended up fast in the third

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
continued horizontal north until out of sight. The two went upwards, then one continued north

15:04.000 --> 15:10.480
until it disappeared and the others west until it disappeared. And now we get to possibly the most

15:10.560 --> 15:17.440
crucial corroborating multiple sightings of the metapod craft. In 2022, a couple frames allegedly

15:17.440 --> 15:23.520
leaked from a U.S. Navy, Blue Angel cockpit recording of a UFO dropping from the clouds.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.720
Similar to our flyby footage, this is a second generation recording if the mouse on the screen

15:28.800 --> 15:31.520
didn't give it away. Take a look at these frames below.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.240
Pretty incredible, right? Let's go frame by frame to compare to the metapod.

15:48.960 --> 15:54.640
In these three frames, we see the metapod descending rapidly in a horizontal orientation.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.880
Appearing as though the transparent face is facing away from the craft's trajectory.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.600
Interestingly enough, four other signatures appear alongside the craft.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.800
In this frame, we see the back of the craft facing the ground with the transparent face

16:08.800 --> 16:13.680
oriented towards the sky. If this leak is true and believe me, I'm still trying to get to the

16:13.680 --> 16:19.440
bottom of it, the metapod shape is a legitimate form of UAP. Some like to compare the metapod to

16:19.440 --> 16:24.320
the gimbal footage and while it matches the outline of the FLIR footage, I am hesitant to

16:24.320 --> 16:29.920
make this comparison seen as the FLIR footage does not necessarily reflect the object's true shape,

16:30.480 --> 16:34.880
so we will at least keep this explanation to gimbal in mind, but not claim it as fact.

16:35.760 --> 16:40.720
And lastly, we have a hang glider cruising through the skies of Texas in 2023,

16:40.720 --> 16:46.080
appearing to observe the metapod. While early and late frames of this video accurately show

16:46.080 --> 16:52.320
the vertically positioned pod, the front facing view throws some doubt into the footage's credibility

16:52.320 --> 16:56.000
in my opinion as it does not match the metapod seen in other videos.

16:58.560 --> 17:03.520
Of all the videos we have reviewed, this in my opinion has probably the best chance of being

17:03.520 --> 17:11.200
something prosaic or misidentified like a balloon. A 15 to 20 minute video for a 1 to 2 minute

17:11.200 --> 17:16.080
piece of footage? Of course! I'm UAPGurb, you guys know what we're getting into,

17:16.080 --> 17:20.560
I won't settle for anything less than a full analysis. I hope you guys enjoyed this look

17:20.560 --> 17:25.920
into the metapod footage. I remember when this piece of footage first dropped, I was so fascinated,

17:25.920 --> 17:30.480
I had to get to the bottom of it, because there were a couple of accounts on various platforms

17:30.480 --> 17:34.800
like Reddit who reuploaded the video saying it was filmed in Denver, which is my city,

17:34.800 --> 17:39.760
which was just a fallacy, so I'm not sure where that came from, but remember this footage originates

17:39.760 --> 17:45.600
in Spain, but what do you guys think about this metapod footage? Is it too fantastic to be true,

17:45.600 --> 17:49.760
or is it real? I know the memes, I know it looks like the show me what you got heads from Rick and

17:49.760 --> 17:56.560
Morty, but this craft at least to me looks like the real deal, and it's shocking that it almost

17:56.560 --> 18:03.920
looks like a single beam observation craft with the transparent window that almost seems like glass.

18:05.360 --> 18:10.880
It's so enigmatic, I don't even know, I don't even know where to begin thinking about the

18:10.880 --> 18:18.320
implications of this craft and what is piloting it, especially with the non-observable propulsion

18:18.320 --> 18:25.600
methods, but I wanted to get this video out today guys, I know today it is the, I think the 11th of

18:25.600 --> 18:30.560
February, the Sol Foundation just released a bunch of interviews with Grush, Chris Mellon,

18:30.560 --> 18:35.200
Kevin Knuth, Hal Putoff, so the next video which I'm going to try to get out as quick as possible,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.240
I'm going to be reviewing all those panels and kind of putting out my thoughts, so I wanted to get

18:40.240 --> 18:45.200
this footage out, and of course I couldn't slack, had to make sure it was pretty beefy, so please

18:45.280 --> 18:49.040
remember to like and subscribe, leave a comment which you thought, let's get a dialogue started,

18:49.040 --> 18:54.240
and thank you so much for tuning in guys, I'll catch you guys on the next episode I put out,

18:54.240 --> 18:54.880
appreciate it.
