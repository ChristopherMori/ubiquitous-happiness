    "description": "Today guys, we will be investigating the little-known UFO crash and crash retrieval that occurred just north of the small, desert town of Kingman, Arizona on the night of May 20, 1953. This alleged crash retrieval first surfaced in 1973, years before the resurfacing of the Roswell incident in which Jesse Marcel revealed his participation in the cover-up in 1978.\n\nThe first revelations of this retrieval occurred with UFO researcher Raymond Fowler's interview of an engineer on project Upshot-Knothole who was sent to analyze craft ballistics of the wreckage operating under the pseudonym Fitz Warner. It would later come to light that Fitz was indeed respected engineer Arthur Stansel who had an accomplished career in the US armed forces, civilian engineering at Wright Patterson, and the Atomic Energy Commission. \n\nBesides Stansel's shocking testimony, his work under Dr. Ed Doll and Dr. Eric Wang alongside add interest to the alleged crash. Events around this time such as USAF regulation 200-2, the Robertson Panel, and the testimonies of Robert Jacobs & Robert Salas on UFOs and nukes add key context to the event.\n\nAlso testifying to the Kingman Crash is retired USMC vet and engineer Bill Uhouse who claimed to work on a flying saucer simulator based on the craft retrieved from the 53 Kingman Crash.\n\nStrap in and don't crash as we analyze the Kingman UAP Crash!\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:08 Fitz Werner AKA Arthur Stansel Jr.\n8:41 Stansel's Claims\n11:14 Kingman Crash Context\n13:16 Bill Uhouse\n17:12 Additional Witnesses & Disinformation\n18:44 Conclusion\n\nKingman Overview: https://www.ufoinsight.com/ufos/cover-ups/kingman-ufo-crash\n\nFitz Werner Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffONAXpPJH8&t=301s\n\nArthur Stansel Junior Backgroud: https://medium.com/@richgel99/1953-kingman-az-crash-retrieval-6eac40d724c7\n\nRay Fowler & Stansel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4CvjWEB6C8&t=212s\n\nOperation Upshot-Knothole Docs: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA121624.pdf\n\nhttps://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA073476.pdf\n\nDr. Ed Droll: https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/edward-b-doll/\n\nDr. Wang: https://www.ufocasebook.com/Arizona.html\n\nUSAF Regulation 200-2: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81R00560R000100040072-9.pdf\n\nUAP Gerb Stigma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKArN8S9bnM&t=4s\n\nUAP Gerb Nukes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DK2u8HlhDE&t=14s\n\nBill Uhouse Testimony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxA-Y4enohQ\n\nUhouse Background: https://medium.com/@richgel99/william-bill-g-uhouses-marine-corps-service-verified-53890a291fac\n\nHow and Why On Simulator: https://web.archive.org/web/20220718203329/https:/www.howandwhys.com/former-area-51-engineer-claimed-testing-re-engineered-ufo-that-crashed-in-arizona-in-1953-with-four-aliens/\n\nLeanord Stringfield On Crash (Part 1 and 2): https://github.com/richgel999/uap_resources/blob/main/1978_Mufon_Symposium_Stringfield.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/FSR%201979%20V%2025%20N%205.pdf\n\nMusic by the Always Talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg\n\nNick Redfern on Kingman: (Pg 37): https://archive.org/details/crash-retrieval-conference-proceedings-3rd-annual-2005/page/37/mode/1up\n\n#ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker #kingman #ufocrash #nickredfern",
