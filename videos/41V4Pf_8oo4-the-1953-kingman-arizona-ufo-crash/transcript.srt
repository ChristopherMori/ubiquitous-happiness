1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
It didn't start or end with Roswell. Throughout American and world history,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,680
there are numerous encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,520
and eyewitnesses. Today, we investigate one of these encounters that occurred during the mass

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:26,800
UFO wave of 1952 to 1954. Let's travel to the night of May 20th, 1953, to a small town situated

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,800
between Hualapa Valley and the Servant Mountain Range called Kingman, Arizona, where something

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,720
perplexing and inexplicable crashed into the desert. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb. Today, I want to dive

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,720
into the story of one of my all-time favorite alleged crash retrievals, the 1953 Kingman,

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,200
Arizona UFO crash. This story is massively overshadowed by the Roswells of the world,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,520
yet features two extremely credible witnesses and surprising connections to our usual suspects,

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,200
the AEC and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Is this crash fact or fiction? Well guys, we will do our

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:19,280
very best to find out. The story of the Kingman crash first surfaced publicly in 1973, five years

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,800
before Jesse Marcel famously told Stanton Freeman he was a part of the Roswell cover-up

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,080
in order to pose with fake wreckage comprised of balsa wood and aluminum foil while the crash

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,600
disc was secretly whisked away. In 1973, UFO researcher Raymond Fowler revealed shocking

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,400
statements made and sworn into affidavit by a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base engineer and

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,960
USAF project engineer on Operation Upshot Not Whole under the pseudonym Fritz Warner.

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,880
And before we get into the story, what is this weird name Upshot Not Whole? This was a series of

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,920
11 nuclear test shots conducted in early 1953 at the Nevada Proving Ground, orchestrated by none

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,120
other than the Atomic Energy Commission. The objective of this project was to utilize tactical

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,440
nuclear weapons to ready the US military for atomic combat. These tests even oversaw a nuclear

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,280
payload shot out of artillery cannons. An estimated 18 to 21,000 DOD personnel participated in this

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,680
program in 1953. Anyways, back to Warner, let's hear his story. Warner stated to Fowler he was

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,640
an engineer on USAF contract with the AEC for Operation Upshot Not Whole. His job was to measure

24
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,920
blast effects on various types of buildings constructed for the tests. On May 20, 1953,

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,160
Fitz spent most of the day at Frenchman Flat. Dr. Ed Dahl telephoned Warner that evening he

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,960
would be doing a special job the following day. Joined by 15 other AEC specialists,

27
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,120
Warner reported to Indian Springs Air Force Base. There he was put on a plane to Phoenix with all

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,320
of his valuables left in the custody of the military police and eventually placed on a bus

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,560
with blacked out windows. During the four hour ride, an Air Force Colonel told the personnel

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,800
a super secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and these specialists were sent in to investigate

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,640
their speciality and theirs only. When he finally got off the bus, Fitz observed two agonizingly

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,760
bright spotlights centered on a crashed object surrounded by guards. In Fitz's own words,

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,920
quote, the object was oval and looked like two deep saucers. One inverted upon the other. It was

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,720
about 30 feet in diameter with convex surfaces top and bottom. These surfaces were about 20 feet

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,960
in diameter. Part of the object had sunk into the ground. It was constructed of a dull silver

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,280
metal like brushed aluminum. The metal was darker where the saucer lips formed a rim around which

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,920
were what looked like slots. A curved open hatch door was located on the leading end and was

38
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,560
vertically lowered. There was a light coming from inside but it could have been installed by the

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Air Force, end quote. Warner's duty was to attempt to determine the angle from which the

40
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,480
object impacted into the sand and how fast the vehicle was moving with forward and vertical

41
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,880
velocities at the time. The craft had sunk roughly 20 inches into the sand and featured no

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,560
landing gear and shockingly no damage. No marks or dents on the surface not even scratches. Over

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,000
time Fitz estimated the craft had been traveling at roughly 1200 miles per hour and amazingly

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,240
Fitz claimed to glance at a guarded pitch tent where lied the body of a dead pilot.

45
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,160
It appeared to be a four foot tall humanoid biologic with dark brown skin and a silvery

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,880
metallic looking suit. Keep this pilot description in mind. After being interviewed on his crash

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,080
velocity estimations over a tape recorder, Fitz managed to speak to someone who claimed to have

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,760
glanced inside the craft and observed two swivel like seats as well as numerous strange and anomalous

49
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,760
instruments in displays. Fitz finally returned to the bus and headed back to Phoenix. The Air

50
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,120
Force Colonel had all 16 AEC personnel swear an oath not to reveal their findings and were instructed

51
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,640
to write their reports longhand and to not type or reproduce. There is Warner's story truly fantastic

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,240
and difficult to conceptualize under just a simple pseudonym right? Well what if I told you the

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,560
enigmatic Fitz Warner's identity has been revealed but first quickly let's first review the

54
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,120
affidavits signed by Fitz with Raymond Fowler as witness. This excerpt of the affidavit is from

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,040
Fowler's book Casebook of a UFO Investigator under the section Crash Retrievals of the Third Kind.

56
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,000
I, Fritz Warner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with the U.S. Air Force on

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,480
May 21st, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a crashed unknown object in the vicinity of

58
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,040
Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembled brushed aluminum.

59
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,560
It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign of structural damage. It was oval and

60
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,240
about 30 feet in diameter. An entranceway hatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,200
about three and a half feet high and one and a half feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,440
someone on the team who did get a look inside only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin,

63
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,920
and a lot of instrumentation and display. A tent pitch near the object sheltered the

64
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,680
dead remains of the only occupant of the craft. It was about four feet tall, dark brown complexion,

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,520
and had two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, and a small round mouth. It was closed in a silvery

66
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,560
metallic suit and wore a skullcap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering

67
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,080
her helmet. I certify that the above statement is true of fixing my signature to this document

68
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,960
on this day of June 7, 1973, signed Fitz Warner, witnessed by Raymond E. Fowler.

69
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,240
Fitz's identity was later on revealed and confirmed by Fowler as one Arthur Stancell Jr.

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,040
Now, quite often his name is spelled S-T-A-N-C-I-L, which is incorrect in a confusion. It's S-T-A-N-S-E-L.

71
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,800
But anyway, Stancell's background and credentials can be directly confirmed.

72
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,440
Stancell began his career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at that time, Wright-Patterson

73
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,280
Airfield, serving as a USAF aircraft engineer, test mechanical engineer for the Air Material Command

74
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,200
after honorably taking part in the D-date landings of World War II. Arthur was additionally working

75
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,560
at the Nevada Proving Grounds on May of 1953 when the crash occurred, specifically studying the

76
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,240
effects of atomic blast on structures, as Fitz stated, and this was during Operation Upshot

77
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Knot Hole. To add even more credibility to Stancell, the engineer also worked on aspects of the

78
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Manhattan Project and for 16 years on the Apollo program. Huge thanks to Richard Geldrick Jr. for

79
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,400
doing the digging on Stancell as you'll find in his linked medium article. So unlike some more

80
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,480
controversial figures in ufology like Bob Lazar, we can in fact verify the background of Wright

81
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:48,800
Pat, the AEC, and aircraft testing with Stancell. Let's start to break down and analyze the context

82
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,480
of some of Stancell's claims. Remember first, his story came out in 1973 and 1978 was when

83
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,840
Marcel revealed the truth of the Roswell cover-up. We can definitively rule out this accomplished

84
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,280
engineer was just writing the coattail of the Roswell crash. Within Stancell's testimony,

85
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,400
he mentions the night before viewing the wreckage receiving a phone call to report by one doctor,

86
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,720
Ed Dahl, who was in fact a project director and physicist for Operation Upshot Knot Hole

87
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,920
at the Nevada Test Site. Unfortunately, Dahl has long since passed and no statements were

88
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,000
ever made by him about this alleged crash retrieval. However, there is another man with possibly even

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,040
deeper connections to UFO crash retrieval. During his time working as an engineer at

90
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,600
Wright Field from 1949 to 1960, Stancell worked in what was known as the Air Material Command

91
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,880
Installation Division within the Office of Special Studies headed by Dr. Eric Wang. Dr. Wang was an

92
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,480
Austrian-born graduate of the Vienna Technical Institute. In 49, Wang became the director of

93
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,640
the Department of Special Studies at Wright Patterson where he worked with scientists from

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,400
the Office of Naval Research and Dr. Vannevar Bush, who has some connections to the UFO phenomena

95
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,200
and others from the Research and Development Board. Dr. Wang relocated his research from

96
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,640
Wright Field to Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico around the time of Operation

97
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Upshot Knot Hole. Tracking down record of Wang has proven to be extremely challenging. However,

98
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,520
direct proof can be found of his role in the Department of Special Studies in the actual

99
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,120
DOD operation Upshot Knot Hole unclassified document. The importance of determining Wang's

100
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,400
credentials cannot be understated, seen as Wang is a figure in UFO lore suspected of having deep

101
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,000
ties to reverse engineering and crash retrievals around this time. More investigating needs to be

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,960
done here, but Wang allegedly led reverse engineering efforts under Kissinger. Wang was known to be a

103
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,520
close associate of Victor Schauerberger, an operation paperclip scientist who developed

104
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,920
concepts for flying discs for the Nazis. Wang, of course, is not the focus of today's video. Neither

105
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,920
is Dahl, but Stansel serving under both Wang and Dahl to an extent during the 1953 crash is of note.

106
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:25,760
Three months after the alleged Arizona crash in 1953, the USAF issued Regulation 200-2,

107
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,880
which required all UFO reporting to be sent to USAF Intelligence and not Project Blue Book,

108
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,360
the official USG investigation group at the time. This directly stovepiped UFO reporting leading to

109
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,000
fewer credible reports making their way to Congress and the American people, fueling the

110
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,280
growing UFO stigma. I talked about this a lot in my Stigma video, go check that out. If you watched

111
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,680
my history on the UFO stigma, you will know the Robertson Panel was conducted to quell public

112
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,120
interest in UFOs, and was commenced in January of 1953, four months before the Kingman crash.

113
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,720
While Regulation 200-2 most definitely relates to the Robertson Panel,

114
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,280
it is quite plausible to suspect that restricting UFO reporting was to keep a tight lid on previous

115
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,560
and future crash retrievals like the Kingman Arizona crash and possibly Roswell. Also,

116
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,840
a key piece here is the AEC's connection to Upshot Knothole and the Kingman crash.

117
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,240
As my community can probably recite by heart, the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement has been used to

118
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,120
misclassify UFO material as quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear material to avoid declassification

119
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,560
and restrict information to need to know basis. The 2024 NDAA Schumer legislation directly states

120
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,040
the 54 Atomic Energy Act has been used by DOD and legacy programs to protect UFO program records

121
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,480
and materials. And while we're at it, let's not forget the testimony of Lieutenant Robert Jacobs

122
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,760
and Robert Salas of Maelstrom Air Force Base. If you have not seen my video on UFOs and nukes,

123
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,680
I highly recommend watching to understand this anomalous connection of UFO to nuclear weapons.

124
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,920
So the idea a UFO is active near the Nevada test range after 11 nuclear warheads were detonated

125
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:24,240
in 1953 is far from surprising. Shockingly, Stansel was not the only credible whistleblower

126
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,320
to make claims about the Kingman crash. Meet the under-the-radar alleged UFO reverse engineering

127
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,160
whistleblower Bill Uhouse. Uhouse was featured on Stephen Greer's disclosure project in October

128
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,880
of 2000 and made some astounding claims. Uhouse was a former mechanical engineer and 14-year

129
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,960
USMC vet retired at the rank of captain with a history of flight testing of exotic experimental

130
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,000
aircraft at Wright Pat. While working for a defense contractor and Wright Patterson Air Force

131
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Base, Uhouse claimed to work as a pilot and design engineer for a flying disk simulator.

132
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,280
The simulator, according to Bill, became operational in 63 to 64 and was based off

133
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,920
a recovered disk retrieval. And you can probably guess the crash he names.

134
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:22,160
As I watch, the reason why I'm saying this is because the simulator wasn't actually functional

135
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:30,960
until around 1958 where the simulator was actually operable. The simulator that they used or the

136
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,920
craft that they used to build, which is a 30-meter one, was the one that the crashed in

137
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:48,000
Arizona, Kingman, Arizona, back in 53 or 52, I think it was 53.

138
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,760
According to Uhouse, the craft was taken to Area 51 slash the Groom Lake facility

139
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,280
and the dead pilots were taken to Los Alamos, part of the AEC. Gotta mention, Uhouse also

140
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,600
makes numerous other statements including touching on a recovered extraterrestrial

141
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,400
humanoid codenamed J-Rot. However, this of course is not the subject of our video.

142
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Because Uhouse is making such high-profile claims and disclosing through Greer, he must

143
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,160
be riddled with red flags, no? Guys, I have to do this myself too, but let's start removing

144
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,240
whistleblowers from the stain of Greer and everything he touches. While Greer himself

145
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,760
is egotistical, money-driven, and very problematic, he has platforms numerous

146
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,680
incredible individuals to tell their tales, including Wagan, Uhouse, Herrera, Bushman, etc.

147
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,880
One common thing you will learn from the men with incredible stories, they only disclosed

148
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,800
through Greer because they knew no other route, and many, like Herrera, have regretted going

149
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,560
through Greer. Anyways, Uhouse worked on a flight sim based off the 53 crash disc.

150
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,360
These claims are far too crazy to be taken seriously when we cannot verify a man's

151
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,920
credentials, who discloses through Greer similar to Don Phillips. Thanks again to the

152
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,640
investigation done by Richard Gelderich Jr., Uhouse's storied history in the Marine Corps

153
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:15,840
can be indeed verified. Remember, Uhouse claims 14 years in USMC services, 10 years in the Corps,

154
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,160
and 4 years working with USAF in private industry on experimental testing.

155
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,760
In this clipping from March 3, 1949, we can see proof of William G. Uhouse's re-enlistment with

156
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,240
the Corps after previous USMC service, and again on the 30th of March, 1953. We can see in the

157
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,320
evening times a newspaper article on Uhouse, this article confirms 8 years in USMC service,

158
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,320
and tours in Korea for Uhouse, and importantly shows Bill's demonstrating capabilities of the

159
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,080
Second Engineers Battalion. Bill's role in the Second Engineers Battalion was also confirmed

160
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,360
in the service company report. And lastly with Uhouse, it's just kind of important to note

161
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,520
in this How and Why article, it's stated Uhouse was invited by a man from Link Aviation,

162
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,800
a simulator manufacturer company, to aid in the building of the F-102 simulator,

163
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,160
B-47 simulator, and later on the flying disc simulator based off the Kingman crash.

164
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,480
And quickly, I just want to cover some additional witnesses to this case who

165
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,600
vary wildly in believability and credibility. In 1997, Leonard Stringfield, a respected UFO

166
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,160
researcher, was approached by a pilot after a lecture at the Lunken Airport in Cincinnati,

167
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,240
Ohio. The pilot claimed to have been present at the crash site in 1953 and gave a recount of the

168
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,600
biologics recovered that was very similar to Stansel, around four feet tall, large eyes,

169
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:51,840
brown skin on face, and silvery metallic suits. And in 1994, another man codenamed JLD approached

170
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,760
Stringfield, making similar claims about the crash but died shortly after. The glaring red flag of

171
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,000
these unnamed and unaccredited sources came from one Judy Wolcott, who claimed to UFO researcher

172
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,920
Don Schmidt, her husband, a Vietnam conflict officer, wrote to her saying he had been present

173
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,320
at a UFO crash retrieval in Kingman, Arizona, where biologics had been recovered. Wolcott

174
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,560
claimed her husband unfortunately was killed by NVA in the war. Wolcott was ousted by author Nick

175
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,800
Redfern, who discovered that her events absolutely did not add up. Her husband had not died in Vietnam,

176
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,800
and her own daughter stated Judy often lied and made up stories. Whether this was an attempt at a

177
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,120
claim to fame or purposeful disinformation, we do not know. However, her case and testimony and

178
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,040
the falsity of it is worth mentioning. What's going on guys? I hope everybody enjoyed this

179
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,880
look into the Kingman, Arizona UFO crash. This case is of course severely overshadowed by its

180
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,120
older brother at the 1947 Roswell crash, so little attention is paid to this case. I think it's

181
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,680
incredibly interesting where things get hairy for me like most cases because I do tend to focus on

182
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:12,080
nuts and bolts with my videos is the biologics. The 4 foot tall humanoid looking creatures with

183
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,840
brown faces and silvery metallic suits, it gets strange. One theory I've heard to debunk this

184
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,680
case, which is very strange for me, is USAF secretly testing aircraft and biologic effects

185
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,680
when flying through nuclear clouds. So aircraft were remote controlled and chimpanzees were put

186
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,720
in suits and crashed and killed. This of course doesn't explain the craft resistance to deformation

187
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,720
at 1200 miles per hour, as Stancil said, but that's one of the funny debunks I've come to see.

188
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,960
What do you guys think about the Kingman crash? If you're from Arizona and from the area and

189
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,560
there's some more lore to this case that I am not hearing about, let me know. I'd love to hear from

190
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,200
you guys some people boots on the ground from the actual area, so sorry for the long break guys,

191
