0	5360	It didn't start or end with Roswell. Throughout American and world history,
5360	11680	there are numerous encounters of UAP crash and crash retrieval efforts with credible paper trails
11680	17520	and eyewitnesses. Today, we investigate one of these encounters that occurred during the mass
17520	26800	UFO wave of 1952 to 1954. Let's travel to the night of May 20th, 1953, to a small town situated
26800	32800	between Hualapa Valley and the Servant Mountain Range called Kingman, Arizona, where something
32800	40720	perplexing and inexplicable crashed into the desert. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb. Today, I want to dive
40720	46720	into the story of one of my all-time favorite alleged crash retrievals, the 1953 Kingman,
46720	53200	Arizona UFO crash. This story is massively overshadowed by the Roswells of the world,
53200	59520	yet features two extremely credible witnesses and surprising connections to our usual suspects,
59520	67200	the AEC and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Is this crash fact or fiction? Well guys, we will do our
67200	79280	very best to find out. The story of the Kingman crash first surfaced publicly in 1973, five years
79360	84800	before Jesse Marcel famously told Stanton Freeman he was a part of the Roswell cover-up
84800	90080	in order to pose with fake wreckage comprised of balsa wood and aluminum foil while the crash
90080	97600	disc was secretly whisked away. In 1973, UFO researcher Raymond Fowler revealed shocking
97600	104400	statements made and sworn into affidavit by a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base engineer and
104400	110960	USAF project engineer on Operation Upshot Not Whole under the pseudonym Fritz Warner.
111520	116880	And before we get into the story, what is this weird name Upshot Not Whole? This was a series of
116880	123920	11 nuclear test shots conducted in early 1953 at the Nevada Proving Ground, orchestrated by none
123920	129120	other than the Atomic Energy Commission. The objective of this project was to utilize tactical
129120	135440	nuclear weapons to ready the US military for atomic combat. These tests even oversaw a nuclear
135440	143280	payload shot out of artillery cannons. An estimated 18 to 21,000 DOD personnel participated in this
143280	149680	program in 1953. Anyways, back to Warner, let's hear his story. Warner stated to Fowler he was
149680	156640	an engineer on USAF contract with the AEC for Operation Upshot Not Whole. His job was to measure
156640	163920	blast effects on various types of buildings constructed for the tests. On May 20, 1953,
163920	170160	Fitz spent most of the day at Frenchman Flat. Dr. Ed Dahl telephoned Warner that evening he
170160	176960	would be doing a special job the following day. Joined by 15 other AEC specialists,
176960	183120	Warner reported to Indian Springs Air Force Base. There he was put on a plane to Phoenix with all
183120	188320	of his valuables left in the custody of the military police and eventually placed on a bus
188320	194560	with blacked out windows. During the four hour ride, an Air Force Colonel told the personnel
194560	200800	a super secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and these specialists were sent in to investigate
200800	208640	their speciality and theirs only. When he finally got off the bus, Fitz observed two agonizingly
208640	215760	bright spotlights centered on a crashed object surrounded by guards. In Fitz's own words,
215760	221920	quote, the object was oval and looked like two deep saucers. One inverted upon the other. It was
221920	228720	about 30 feet in diameter with convex surfaces top and bottom. These surfaces were about 20 feet
228720	234960	in diameter. Part of the object had sunk into the ground. It was constructed of a dull silver
234960	241280	metal like brushed aluminum. The metal was darker where the saucer lips formed a rim around which
241280	247920	were what looked like slots. A curved open hatch door was located on the leading end and was
247920	252560	vertically lowered. There was a light coming from inside but it could have been installed by the
252560	258080	Air Force, end quote. Warner's duty was to attempt to determine the angle from which the
258080	264480	object impacted into the sand and how fast the vehicle was moving with forward and vertical
264480	270880	velocities at the time. The craft had sunk roughly 20 inches into the sand and featured no
270880	278560	landing gear and shockingly no damage. No marks or dents on the surface not even scratches. Over
278560	286000	time Fitz estimated the craft had been traveling at roughly 1200 miles per hour and amazingly
286000	292240	Fitz claimed to glance at a guarded pitch tent where lied the body of a dead pilot.
292960	300160	It appeared to be a four foot tall humanoid biologic with dark brown skin and a silvery
300160	306880	metallic looking suit. Keep this pilot description in mind. After being interviewed on his crash
306880	312080	velocity estimations over a tape recorder, Fitz managed to speak to someone who claimed to have
312080	319760	glanced inside the craft and observed two swivel like seats as well as numerous strange and anomalous
319840	325760	instruments in displays. Fitz finally returned to the bus and headed back to Phoenix. The Air
325760	333120	Force Colonel had all 16 AEC personnel swear an oath not to reveal their findings and were instructed
333120	340640	to write their reports longhand and to not type or reproduce. There is Warner's story truly fantastic
340640	348240	and difficult to conceptualize under just a simple pseudonym right? Well what if I told you the
348320	354560	enigmatic Fitz Warner's identity has been revealed but first quickly let's first review the
354560	361120	affidavits signed by Fitz with Raymond Fowler as witness. This excerpt of the affidavit is from
361120	367040	Fowler's book Casebook of a UFO Investigator under the section Crash Retrievals of the Third Kind.
368480	374000	I, Fritz Warner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with the U.S. Air Force on
374000	380480	May 21st, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a crashed unknown object in the vicinity of
380480	387040	Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembled brushed aluminum.
387040	392560	It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign of structural damage. It was oval and
392560	398240	about 30 feet in diameter. An entranceway hatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was
398240	403200	about three and a half feet high and one and a half feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with
403200	409440	someone on the team who did get a look inside only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin,
409440	413920	and a lot of instrumentation and display. A tent pitch near the object sheltered the
413920	419680	dead remains of the only occupant of the craft. It was about four feet tall, dark brown complexion,
419680	425520	and had two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, and a small round mouth. It was closed in a silvery
425520	430560	metallic suit and wore a skullcap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering
430560	436080	her helmet. I certify that the above statement is true of fixing my signature to this document
436080	442960	on this day of June 7, 1973, signed Fitz Warner, witnessed by Raymond E. Fowler.
443600	450240	Fitz's identity was later on revealed and confirmed by Fowler as one Arthur Stancell Jr.
450800	459040	Now, quite often his name is spelled S-T-A-N-C-I-L, which is incorrect in a confusion. It's S-T-A-N-S-E-L.
459680	464800	But anyway, Stancell's background and credentials can be directly confirmed.
464800	469440	Stancell began his career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at that time, Wright-Patterson
469440	477280	Airfield, serving as a USAF aircraft engineer, test mechanical engineer for the Air Material Command
477280	483200	after honorably taking part in the D-date landings of World War II. Arthur was additionally working
483200	488560	at the Nevada Proving Grounds on May of 1953 when the crash occurred, specifically studying the
488560	494240	effects of atomic blast on structures, as Fitz stated, and this was during Operation Upshot
494240	500160	Knot Hole. To add even more credibility to Stancell, the engineer also worked on aspects of the
500160	507200	Manhattan Project and for 16 years on the Apollo program. Huge thanks to Richard Geldrick Jr. for
507200	512400	doing the digging on Stancell as you'll find in his linked medium article. So unlike some more
512400	518480	controversial figures in ufology like Bob Lazar, we can in fact verify the background of Wright
518480	528800	Pat, the AEC, and aircraft testing with Stancell. Let's start to break down and analyze the context
528800	536480	of some of Stancell's claims. Remember first, his story came out in 1973 and 1978 was when
536480	541840	Marcel revealed the truth of the Roswell cover-up. We can definitively rule out this accomplished
541840	547280	engineer was just writing the coattail of the Roswell crash. Within Stancell's testimony,
547280	552400	he mentions the night before viewing the wreckage receiving a phone call to report by one doctor,
552400	558720	Ed Dahl, who was in fact a project director and physicist for Operation Upshot Knot Hole
558720	563920	at the Nevada Test Site. Unfortunately, Dahl has long since passed and no statements were
563920	570000	ever made by him about this alleged crash retrieval. However, there is another man with possibly even
570000	575040	deeper connections to UFO crash retrieval. During his time working as an engineer at
575040	581600	Wright Field from 1949 to 1960, Stancell worked in what was known as the Air Material Command
581600	588880	Installation Division within the Office of Special Studies headed by Dr. Eric Wang. Dr. Wang was an
588880	594480	Austrian-born graduate of the Vienna Technical Institute. In 49, Wang became the director of
594480	598640	the Department of Special Studies at Wright Patterson where he worked with scientists from
598640	606400	the Office of Naval Research and Dr. Vannevar Bush, who has some connections to the UFO phenomena
606400	611200	and others from the Research and Development Board. Dr. Wang relocated his research from
611200	616640	Wright Field to Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico around the time of Operation
616640	623120	Upshot Knot Hole. Tracking down record of Wang has proven to be extremely challenging. However,
623120	627520	direct proof can be found of his role in the Department of Special Studies in the actual
627520	633120	DOD operation Upshot Knot Hole unclassified document. The importance of determining Wang's
633120	640400	credentials cannot be understated, seen as Wang is a figure in UFO lore suspected of having deep
640400	646000	ties to reverse engineering and crash retrievals around this time. More investigating needs to be
646000	652960	done here, but Wang allegedly led reverse engineering efforts under Kissinger. Wang was known to be a
652960	659520	close associate of Victor Schauerberger, an operation paperclip scientist who developed
659520	665920	concepts for flying discs for the Nazis. Wang, of course, is not the focus of today's video. Neither
665920	673920	is Dahl, but Stansel serving under both Wang and Dahl to an extent during the 1953 crash is of note.
674800	685760	Three months after the alleged Arizona crash in 1953, the USAF issued Regulation 200-2,
686400	692880	which required all UFO reporting to be sent to USAF Intelligence and not Project Blue Book,
692880	699360	the official USG investigation group at the time. This directly stovepiped UFO reporting leading to
699360	704000	fewer credible reports making their way to Congress and the American people, fueling the
704000	709280	growing UFO stigma. I talked about this a lot in my Stigma video, go check that out. If you watched
709280	713680	my history on the UFO stigma, you will know the Robertson Panel was conducted to quell public
713680	721120	interest in UFOs, and was commenced in January of 1953, four months before the Kingman crash.
721760	726720	While Regulation 200-2 most definitely relates to the Robertson Panel,
726720	733280	it is quite plausible to suspect that restricting UFO reporting was to keep a tight lid on previous
733280	738560	and future crash retrievals like the Kingman Arizona crash and possibly Roswell. Also,
738560	743840	a key piece here is the AEC's connection to Upshot Knothole and the Kingman crash.
743840	750240	As my community can probably recite by heart, the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement has been used to
750240	757120	misclassify UFO material as quote, trans-classified foreign nuclear material to avoid declassification
757120	764560	and restrict information to need to know basis. The 2024 NDAA Schumer legislation directly states
764560	771040	the 54 Atomic Energy Act has been used by DOD and legacy programs to protect UFO program records
771040	776480	and materials. And while we're at it, let's not forget the testimony of Lieutenant Robert Jacobs
776480	781760	and Robert Salas of Maelstrom Air Force Base. If you have not seen my video on UFOs and nukes,
781760	787680	I highly recommend watching to understand this anomalous connection of UFO to nuclear weapons.
787680	793920	So the idea a UFO is active near the Nevada test range after 11 nuclear warheads were detonated
793920	804240	in 1953 is far from surprising. Shockingly, Stansel was not the only credible whistleblower
804240	810320	to make claims about the Kingman crash. Meet the under-the-radar alleged UFO reverse engineering
810320	816160	whistleblower Bill Uhouse. Uhouse was featured on Stephen Greer's disclosure project in October
816160	822880	of 2000 and made some astounding claims. Uhouse was a former mechanical engineer and 14-year
822880	828960	USMC vet retired at the rank of captain with a history of flight testing of exotic experimental
828960	834000	aircraft at Wright Pat. While working for a defense contractor and Wright Patterson Air Force
834000	840960	Base, Uhouse claimed to work as a pilot and design engineer for a flying disk simulator.
841520	847280	The simulator, according to Bill, became operational in 63 to 64 and was based off
847280	851920	a recovered disk retrieval. And you can probably guess the crash he names.
852320	862160	As I watch, the reason why I'm saying this is because the simulator wasn't actually functional
862160	870960	until around 1958 where the simulator was actually operable. The simulator that they used or the
872080	877920	craft that they used to build, which is a 30-meter one, was the one that the crashed in
878720	888000	Arizona, Kingman, Arizona, back in 53 or 52, I think it was 53.
888800	893760	According to Uhouse, the craft was taken to Area 51 slash the Groom Lake facility
893760	899280	and the dead pilots were taken to Los Alamos, part of the AEC. Gotta mention, Uhouse also
899280	903600	makes numerous other statements including touching on a recovered extraterrestrial
903600	908400	humanoid codenamed J-Rot. However, this of course is not the subject of our video.
909200	914400	Because Uhouse is making such high-profile claims and disclosing through Greer, he must
914400	920160	be riddled with red flags, no? Guys, I have to do this myself too, but let's start removing
920160	926240	whistleblowers from the stain of Greer and everything he touches. While Greer himself
926240	931760	is egotistical, money-driven, and very problematic, he has platforms numerous
931760	937680	incredible individuals to tell their tales, including Wagan, Uhouse, Herrera, Bushman, etc.
938240	942880	One common thing you will learn from the men with incredible stories, they only disclosed
942880	948800	through Greer because they knew no other route, and many, like Herrera, have regretted going
948800	954560	through Greer. Anyways, Uhouse worked on a flight sim based off the 53 crash disc.
955120	959360	These claims are far too crazy to be taken seriously when we cannot verify a man's
959360	963920	credentials, who discloses through Greer similar to Don Phillips. Thanks again to the
963920	968640	investigation done by Richard Gelderich Jr., Uhouse's storied history in the Marine Corps
968640	975840	can be indeed verified. Remember, Uhouse claims 14 years in USMC services, 10 years in the Corps,
975840	980160	and 4 years working with USAF in private industry on experimental testing.
980160	985760	In this clipping from March 3, 1949, we can see proof of William G. Uhouse's re-enlistment with
985760	992240	the Corps after previous USMC service, and again on the 30th of March, 1953. We can see in the
992240	998320	evening times a newspaper article on Uhouse, this article confirms 8 years in USMC service,
998320	1004320	and tours in Korea for Uhouse, and importantly shows Bill's demonstrating capabilities of the
1004320	1010080	Second Engineers Battalion. Bill's role in the Second Engineers Battalion was also confirmed
1010080	1015360	in the service company report. And lastly with Uhouse, it's just kind of important to note
1015360	1021520	in this How and Why article, it's stated Uhouse was invited by a man from Link Aviation,
1021520	1026800	a simulator manufacturer company, to aid in the building of the F-102 simulator,
1026800	1032160	B-47 simulator, and later on the flying disc simulator based off the Kingman crash.
1036800	1040480	And quickly, I just want to cover some additional witnesses to this case who
1040480	1047600	vary wildly in believability and credibility. In 1997, Leonard Stringfield, a respected UFO
1047600	1052160	researcher, was approached by a pilot after a lecture at the Lunken Airport in Cincinnati,
1052160	1058240	Ohio. The pilot claimed to have been present at the crash site in 1953 and gave a recount of the
1058240	1063600	biologics recovered that was very similar to Stansel, around four feet tall, large eyes,
1063600	1071840	brown skin on face, and silvery metallic suits. And in 1994, another man codenamed JLD approached
1071840	1077760	Stringfield, making similar claims about the crash but died shortly after. The glaring red flag of
1077760	1084000	these unnamed and unaccredited sources came from one Judy Wolcott, who claimed to UFO researcher
1084000	1089920	Don Schmidt, her husband, a Vietnam conflict officer, wrote to her saying he had been present
1089920	1096320	at a UFO crash retrieval in Kingman, Arizona, where biologics had been recovered. Wolcott
1096320	1102560	claimed her husband unfortunately was killed by NVA in the war. Wolcott was ousted by author Nick
1102560	1108800	Redfern, who discovered that her events absolutely did not add up. Her husband had not died in Vietnam,
1108800	1114800	and her own daughter stated Judy often lied and made up stories. Whether this was an attempt at a
1114800	1121120	claim to fame or purposeful disinformation, we do not know. However, her case and testimony and
1121120	1127040	the falsity of it is worth mentioning. What's going on guys? I hope everybody enjoyed this
1127040	1132880	look into the Kingman, Arizona UFO crash. This case is of course severely overshadowed by its
1132880	1139120	older brother at the 1947 Roswell crash, so little attention is paid to this case. I think it's
1139120	1143680	incredibly interesting where things get hairy for me like most cases because I do tend to focus on
1143680	1152080	nuts and bolts with my videos is the biologics. The 4 foot tall humanoid looking creatures with
1153120	1159840	brown faces and silvery metallic suits, it gets strange. One theory I've heard to debunk this
1159840	1165680	case, which is very strange for me, is USAF secretly testing aircraft and biologic effects
1165680	1171680	when flying through nuclear clouds. So aircraft were remote controlled and chimpanzees were put
1171680	1178720	in suits and crashed and killed. This of course doesn't explain the craft resistance to deformation
1178720	1184720	at 1200 miles per hour, as Stancil said, but that's one of the funny debunks I've come to see.
1184720	1190960	What do you guys think about the Kingman crash? If you're from Arizona and from the area and
1190960	1196560	there's some more lore to this case that I am not hearing about, let me know. I'd love to hear from
1196560	1201200	you guys some people boots on the ground from the actual area, so sorry for the long break guys,
1201200	1205440	we'll be back to normal posting now. If you like this video, please remember to like and
